<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Although preeclampsia has been suggested potential risk factors including placental and systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal steroid metabolism during pregnancy, the pathogenesis of preeclampsia has not fully been elucidated, particularly in steroid metabolism. The association between various cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated steroid metabolic markers and preeclampsia risk was therefore investigated. The serum levels of 54 CYP-mediated regioselective hydroxysteroids and their substrates were quantitatively evaluated from both pregnant women with preeclampsia (n=30; age, 30.8±4.5 years) and normotensive controls (n=30; age, 31.0±3.5 years), who were similar with respect to maternal age, gestational age, and body mass index. The levels of 6ß-, 7a-, and 11ß-hydroxymetabolites of androgens and corticoids were significantly increased in women with preeclampsia. In addition, the levels of oxysterols, including 7a-, 7ß-, 4ß-, 20a-, 24S-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, were markedly higher, while the levels of 16a-OH-DHEA, 16a-OH-androstenedione, and cholesterol were significantly decreased in patients. The 6ß-hydroxylation of androgens and corticoids by CYP3A4 (P&lt;0.01), the activation of 20,22-desmolase (a cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) by CYP11A1 (P&lt;0.00001), and the multi-hydroxylation of cholesterol at C-4ß, C-7a, C-7ß, C-24S, C-27, and C-20a (P&lt;0.0001) by catalytic or enzymatic reaction (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP7A1, CYP27A1, and CYP46A1) were differed between preeclamptic women and control subjects. In particular, an increased oxysterols (induction&gt;2.0-fold) were positively correlated with the conditions of preeclampsia. Our metabolic profiling suggests the CYP-mediated alterations in steroid metabolism and hydroxylation in pregnancy-induced hypertension. These multiple markers could serve as background information for improved clinical diagnosis and management during pregnancy.

An essential regulator of gene transcription, nuclear receptor liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) controls cell differentiation in the developing pancreas and maintains cholesterol homeostasis in adults. Recent genome-wide association studies linked mutations in the LRH-1 gene and its up-stream regulatory regions to development of pancreatic cancer. In this work, we show that LRH-1 transcription is activated up to 30-fold in human pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic ductal epithelium. This activation correlates with markedly increased LRH-1 protein expression in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in vivo. Selective blocking of LRH-1 by receptor specific siRNA significantly inhibits pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro. The inhibition is tracked in part to the attenuation of the receptor's transcriptional targets controlling cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Previously, LRH-1 was shown to contribute to formation of intestinal tumors. This study demonstrates the critical involvement of LRH-1 in development and progression of pancreatic cancer, suggesting the LRH-1 receptor as a plausible therapeutic target for treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.
Liver receptor homolog (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor (NR5A2) that regulates cholesterol homeostasis and cell plasticity in endodermal-derived tissues. Estrogen increases LRH-1 expression conveying cell protection and proliferation. Independently, estrogen also protects isolated human islets against cytokine-induced apoptosis. Herein, we demonstrate that LRH-1 is expressed in islets, including β-cells, and that transcript levels are modulated by 17β-estradiol through the estrogen receptor (ER)α but not ERβ signaling pathway. Repression of LRH-1 by siRNA abrogated the protective effect conveyed by estrogen on rat islets against cytokines. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of LRH-1 in human islets did not alter proliferation but conferred protection against cytokines and streptozotocin-induced apoptosis. Expression levels of the cell cycle genes cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 as well as the antiapoptotic gene bcl-xl were unaltered in LRH-1 expressing islets. In contrast, the steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 involved in glucocorticoid biosynthesis were both stimulated in transduced islets. In parallel, graded overexpression of LRH-1 dose-dependently impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of the estrogen target gene nr5a2 in protecting human islets against-stressed-induced apoptosis. We postulate that this effect is mediated through increased glucocorticoid production that blunts the pro-inflammatory response of islets.
α(1)-Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), also known as liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is highly expressed in liver and intestine, where it is implicated in the regulation of cholesterol, bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis. FTF is an important regulator of bile acid metabolism. We show here that FTF plays a key regulatory role in lipid homeostasis including triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. FTF deficient mice developed lower levels of serum triglyceride and cholesterol as a result of lower expression of several hepatic FTF target genes. Chenodeoxycholic acid repressed FTF expression resulting in a decrease in serum triglyceride in wild-type mice. The absence of chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated repression in FTF(+/-) mice demonstrated the essential role of FTF in triglyceride metabolism. Taken together, our results identify the nuclear receptor FTF as a central regulator of lipid metabolism.
In postmenopausal breast cancers, the increase in aromatase expression observed in tumour associated adipose stromal cells is mediated via the upregulation of promoter II (PII) transcription. Factors such as PGE₂ which are secreted from breast carcinomas induce PII expression. The orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1/NR5A2 is one of the critical downstream transcriptional mediators of this effect. The aim of the current study was to determine whether LRH-1 could bind directly to PII and whether the suppression of LRH-1 expression could inhibit aromatase expression in human adipose stromal fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated endogenous LRH-1 occupancy on PII under basal conditions and with treatment with forskolin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). To assess the impact of LRH-1 knockdown on FSK/PMA mediated PII expression, cells were transfected with shRNA targeted against LRH-1 (shLRH-1) and treated with forskolin and PMA. A decrease in LRH-1, PII and total aromatase mRNA transcripts was observed in shLRH-1 transfected cells compared to controls under basal and treatment conditions. The results of this study support the hypothesis that suppression of LRH-1 may potentially be beneficial in the tissue specific regulation of aromatase expression in post menopausal breast cancer.
Glucocorticoids (GC) have important anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic activities. Initially thought to be exclusively produced by the adrenal glands, there is now increasing evidence for extra-adrenal sources of GCs. We have previously shown that the intestinal epithelium produces immunoregulatory GCs and that intestinal steroidogenesis is regulated by the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). As LRH-1 has been implicated in the development of colon cancer, we here investigated whether LRH-1 regulates GC synthesis in colorectal tumors and whether tumor-produced GCs suppress T-cell activation. Colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors were found to express steroidogenic enzymes and regulatory factors required for the de novo synthesis of cortisol. Both cell lines and primary tumors constitutively produced readily detectable levels of cortisol, as measured by radioimmunoassay, thin-layer chromatography and bioassay. Whereas overexpression of LRH-1 significantly increased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and the synthesis of cortisol, downregulation or inhibition of LRH-1 effectively suppressed these processes, indicating an important role of LRH-1 in colorectal tumor GC synthesis. An immunoregulatory role of tumor-derived GCs could be further confirmed by demonstrating a suppression of T-cell activation. This study describes for the first time cortisol synthesis in a non-endocrine tumor in humans, and suggests that the synthesis of bioactive GCs in colon cancer cells may account as a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (NR5A2) is a nuclear receptor originally identified in the liver and mostly known for its regulatory role in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. More recently, liver receptor homolog-1 has emerged as a key regulator of intestinal function, coordinating unanticipated actions, such as cell renewal and local immune function with important implications to common intestinal diseases, including colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Unlike most of the other nuclear receptors, liver receptor homolog-1 acts as a constitutively active transcription factor to drive the transcription of its target genes. Liver receptor homolog-1 activity however is to a major extent regulated by different corepressors and posttranslational modifications, which may account for its tissue-specific functions. This review will provide an update on the molecular aspects of liver receptor homolog-1 action and focus on some emerging aspects of its function in normal and diseased gut. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Translating nuclear receptors from health to disease.
The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) has roles in the development, cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, and steroidogenesis. It also enhances proliferation and cell cycle progression of cancer cells. In breast cancer, LRH-1 expression is associated with invasive breast cancer; positively correlates with ERα status and aromatase activity; and promotes oestrogen-dependent cell proliferation. However, the mechanism of action of LRH-1 in breast cancer epithelial cells is still not clear. By silencing or over-expressing LRH-1 in ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we have demonstrated that LRH-1 promotes motility and cell invasiveness. Similar effects were observed in the non-tumourigenic mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A. Remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cadherin cleavage was observed with LRH-1 over-expression, contributing to increased migratory and invasive properties. Additionally, in LRH-1 over-expressing cells, the truncation of the 120 kDa E-cadherin to the inactive 97 kDa form was observed. These post-translational modifications in E-cadherin may be associated with LRH-1-dependent changes to matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression. These findings suggest a new role of LRH-1 in promoting migration and invasion in breast cancer, independent of oestrogen sensitivity. Therefore, LRH-1 may represent a new target for breast cancer therapeutics.
Estrogen receptor-α (ER) is expressed in the great majority of breast cancers, and the inhibition of ER action is a key part of breast cancer treatment. The inhibition of ER action is achieved using anti-estrogens, primarily tamoxifen, and with aromatase inhibitors that inhibit estrogen biosynthesis, thereby preventing ER activation. However, resistance to these therapies is common. With the aim of identifying new molecular targets for breast cancer therapy, we have identified the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) as an estrogen-regulated gene. RNA interference and over-expression studies were used to investigate the role of the LRH-1 in regulating breast cancer growth and to identify the targets of an LRH-1 action. Promoter recruitment was determined using reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We show that LRH-1 regulates breast cancer cell growth by regulating the ER expression. Reporter gene and in vitro DNA-binding assays identified an LRH-1-binding site in the ER gene promoter, and ChIP assays have demonstrated in vivo binding at this site. We also provide evidence for new LRH-1 variants in breast cancer cells arising from the use of alternative promoters. Previous studies have shown that LRH-1 functions in estrogen biosynthesis by regulating aromatase expression. Our findings extend this by highlighting LRH-1 as a key regulator of the estrogen response in breast cancer cells through the regulation of ER expression. Hence, inhibition of LRH-1 could provide a powerful new approach for the treatment of endocrine-resistant breast cancer.
Previously, we demonstrated that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into steroidogenic cells such as Leydig and adrenocortical cells by the introduction of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and treatment with cAMP. In this study, we employed the same approach to differentiate umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived MSCs. Despite UCB-MSCs differentiating into steroidogenic cells, they exhibited characteristics of granulosa-luteal-like cells. We found that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) was expressed and further induced by cAMP stimulation in UCB-MSCs. Consistent with these results, tissue-specific expression of Pgc-1alpha was observed in rat ovarian granulosa cells. PGC-1alpha binds to the NR5A family [SF-1 and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1)] of proteins and markedly enhances their transcriptional activities. Reporter assays revealed that PGC-1alpha activated the promoter activities of SF-1 and LRH-1 target genes. Infection of KGN cells (a human cell line derived from granulosa cells) with adenoviruses expressing PGC-1alpha resulted in the induction of steroidogenesis-related genes and stimulation of progesterone production. PGC-1alpha also induced SF-1 and LRH-1, with the latter induced to a greater extent. Knockdown of Pgc-1alpha in cultured rat granulosa cells resulted in attenuation of gene expression as well as progesterone production. Transactivation of the NR5A family by PGC-1alpha was repressed by Dax-1. PGC-1alpha binds to the activation function 2 domain of NR5A proteins via its consensus LXXLL motif. These results indicate that PGC-1alpha is involved in progesterone production in ovarian granulosa cells by potentiating transcriptional activities of the NR5A family proteins.
alpha(1)-Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), also known as liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, where it is implicated in the regulation of cholesterol, bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis. FTF is an important regulator of bile acid metabolism. We show here that FTF plays a key regulatory role in lipid homeostasis including triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. FTF deficient mice developed lower levels of serum triglyceride and cholesterol as a result of lower expression of several hepatic FTF target genes. Chenodeoxycholic acid repressed FTF expression resulting in a decrease in serum triglyceride in wild-type mice. The absence of chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated repression in FTF(+/-) mice demonstrated the essential role of FTF in triglyceride metabolism. Taken together, our results identify the nuclear receptor FTF as a central regulator of lipid metabolism.
To investigate the effects of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-ANT) on the expression of anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) and aromatase (via the exon CYP19IIa promoter), in cultured human granulosa cells (hGCs) and the human granulosa cell line (HGL5).
Primary cell cultures of hGCs and culture of HGL5 cells.
Academic center.
Women undergoing IVF because of male factor, tubal infertility, or donor eggs.
hGCs and HGL5 cells were treated with a GnRH-ANT (1 nM and 1 μM) alone or in combination with cAMP (1 mM). Media was collected and stored at -80°C until assayed.
mRNA levels of CYP19 IIa, AMH, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ELISA was used to determined estradiol (E(2)) levels in the culture media. Pooled results from triplicate experiments were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with Student-Newman-Keuls multiple-comparison methods.
The GnRH-ANT decreased the expressions of CYP19 IIa, AMH, SF-1, and LRH-1. cAMP induced aromatase and AMH expression. Cotreatment with cAMP and GnRH-ANT caused a dose-dependent suppression of AMH and CYP19 IIa mRNA. A GnRH agonist (GnRH-A) increased the mRNA expressions of CYP 19 IIa and AMH. The GnRH-ANT decreased E(2) production in cultured hGCs.
GnRH-ANTs, in addition to their central suppressive effects on the pituitary, may have a direct effect on ovarian granulosa cells with inhibition of aromatase and AMH expression. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect could be mediated via suppression of SF-1 and LRH-1, and may play a role in estrogen-mediated ovarian folliculogenesis.
Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, also known as Ad4BP) has been demonstrated to be a primary transcriptional regulator of steroidogenic-related genes. However, mRNA for liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), which together with SF-1, belongs to the NR5A nuclear receptor family, is expressed at much higher levels than SF-1 mRNA in the human gonad. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that SF-1 induced the differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into steroidogenic cells such as Leydig or adrenocortical cells. The introduction of LRH-1 into human MSCs (hMSCs) with the aid of cAMP also induced the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP17, and their differentiation into steroid hormone-producing cells. Promoter analysis, EMSA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using LRH-1-transduced hMSCs indicated that three LRH-1 binding sites were responsible for CYP17 transactivation. Immunohistochemical studies showed that LRH-1 protein was expressed in human Leydig cells. The CYP17 promoter region was highly methylated in hMSCs, whereas it was demethylated by the introduction of LRH-1 and cAMP treatment. These results indicate that LRH-1 could represent another key regulator of the steroidogenic lineage in MSCs and play a vital role in steroid hormone production in human Leydig cells.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene transcription is controlled by viral promoters and enhancers, the activities of which are regulated by a number of cellular factors as well as virally encoded proteins. Negative regulation of HBV cis-element activities by cellular factors has been reported less widely than their activation. In this study, we report that nuclear factor Prospero-related homeobox protein (Prox1) represses HBV antigen expression and genome replication in cultured hepatocytes. By using reporter-gene analysis, three of the four HBV promoters, namely the enhancer II/core promoter (ENII/Cp), preS1 promoter (Sp1) and enhancer I/X promoter, were identified as targets for Prox1-mediated repression. Mechanistic analysis then revealed that, for ENII/Cp, Prox1 serves as a corepressor of liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) and downregulates LRH-1-mediated activation of ENII/Cp, whereas for Sp1, Prox1 partially represses Sp1 activity by interacting directly with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1. Identification of Prox1 as an HBV repressor will help in the understanding of detailed interactions between viral cis elements and host cellular factors and may also form the basis for new anti-HBV intervention therapeutics.
The Dax-1 protein is an enigmatic nuclear receptor that lacks an expected DNA binding domain, yet functions as a potent corepressor of nuclear receptors. Here we report the structure of Dax-1 bound to one of its targets, liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1). Unexpectedly, Dax-1 binds to LRH-1 using a new module, a repressor helix built from a family conserved sequence motif, PCFXXLP. Mutations in this repressor helix that are linked with human endocrine disorders dissociate the complex and attenuate Dax-1 function. The structure of the Dax-1:LRH-1 complex provides the molecular mechanism for the function of Dax-1 as a potent transcriptional repressor.
In this study, we examined the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in regulating the transcription of the liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) in breast cancer cells. We show that S1P induces LRH-1 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells in a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-dependent manner. Both S1P and PGE2 stimulate the recruitment of LRH-1, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP), and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to the LRH-1 promoter, as well as increase acetylation of histone H3 in this region of chromatin. S1P and PGE2 promote the direct interaction of CREB and LRH-1, which is potentiated by C/EBPdelta and the coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP), and steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3). CREB and LRH-1 synergistically increase LRH-1 transcription, suggesting an integral role for LRH-1 in regulating the transcription of its own gene.
Altered signaling pathways or deregulated transcription factors represent an important category of molecular events leading to aberrant gene regulation in gastric cancer, among which the role of WNT/beta-catenin pathway remains unclear. LRH-1 is a critical transcription factor in controlling cell proliferation via crosstalk with the beta-catenin signaling pathway. In order to gain a knowledge of the expression of hLRH-1v1 and hLRH-1 in gastric cancer, a Q-PCR analysis was carried out. Our results showed that in about 50 and 47.6% of 42 tested patients with gastric cancer, the mRNA expression of hLRH-1v1 and hLRH-1 was significantly upregulated, as compared with self-paired normal control, respectively. Besides, overexpression of hLRH-1 was shown to promote the proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma cell SGC-7901 via induction of cyclin E1. Taken together, our present study demonstrated for the first time the increased expression of hLRH-1v1 and hLRH-1 in human gastric cancer, an alteration which may implicate in tumorigenesis.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in intestinal lipid homeostasis and cell proliferation. Here we show that haploinsufficiency of LRH-1 predisposes mice to the development of intestinal inflammation. Besides the increased inflammatory response, LRH-1 heterozygous mice exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid show lower local corticosterone production as a result of an impaired intestinal expression of the enzymes CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, which control the local synthesis of corticosterone in the intestine. Local glucocorticoid production is strictly enterocyte-dependent because it is robustly reduced in epithelium-specific LRH-1-deficient mice. Consistent with these findings, colon biopsies of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis show reduced expression of LRH-1 and genes involved in the production of glucocorticoids. Hence, LRH-1 regulates intestinal immunity in response to immunological stress by triggering local glucocorticoid production. These findings underscore the importance of LRH-1 in the control of intestinal inflammation and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
Estrogen biosynthesis from C(19) steroids is catalyzed by aromatase cytochrome P450. Aromatase is expressed in breast adipose tissue through the use of a distal, cytokine-responsive promoter (promoter I.4). Breast tumors, however, secrete soluble factors that stimulate aromatase expression through an alternative proximal promoter, promoter II. In other estrogenic tissues such as ovaries, transcription from promoter II requires the presence of the Ftz-F1 homologue steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1); adipose tissue, however, does not express SF-1. We have explored the hypothesis that in adipose tissue, an alternative Ftz-F1 family member, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), substitutes for SF-1 in driving transcription from promoter II. In transient transfection assays using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, promoter II reporter constructs were modestly (2-3-fold) stimulated by either treatment with activators of protein kinases A or C (PKA/C) or by cotransfection with LRH-1. In combination, these treatments synergistically activated promoter II (&gt;30-fold). Induction by LRH-1 (but not by PKA/C) required an AGGTCA motif at -130 base pairs, to which LRH-1 bound in gel shift assays. Activity of GAL4-LRH-1 fusion proteins was not altered by activators of PKA or PKC. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that LRH-1 (but not SF-1) is expressed in the preadipocyte fraction of human adipose tissue at levels comparable with that of liver. Differentiation of cultured human preadipocytes into mature adipocytes was associated with a time-dependent induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and rapid loss of LRH-1 and aromatase expression. We conclude that LRH-1 is a preadipocyte-specific nuclear receptor that regulates expression of aromatase in adipose tissue. Alterations in LRH-1 expression and/or activity in adipose tissue could therefore have considerable effects on local estrogen production and breast cancer development.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) are two orphan members of the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors. LRH-1 is expressed in tissues derived from endoderm, including intestine, liver and exocrine pancreas, as well as in the ovary. In these tissues, LRH-1 plays a predominant role in development, reverse cholesterol transport, bile-acid homeostasis and steroidogenesis. SF-1 expression is confined to steroidogenic tissues and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, where it is involved in the control of development, differentiation, steroidogenesis and sexual determination. In this article, we will review data concerning the structure, regulation and function of LRH-1. These data highlight structural similarities between LRH-1 and other Ftz-F1 members but also underscore important functional differences, assigning to LRH-1 a unique position among nuclear receptors.
Orphan receptors of the FTZ-F1-related group of nuclear receptors (xFF1r) were identified in Xenopus laevis by isolation of cDNAs from a neurula stage library. Two cDNAs were found, which encode full length, highly related receptor proteins, xFF1rA and B, whose closet relative known so far is the murine LRH-1 orphan receptor. xFF1rA protein expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus system specifically binds to FTZ-F1 response elements (FRE; PyCAAGGPyCPu). In cotransfection studies, xFF1rA constitutively activates transcription, in a manner dependent on the number of FREs. The amounts of at least four mRNAs encoding full-length receptors greatly increase between gastrula and early tailbud stages and decrease at later stages. At early tailbud stages, xFTZ-F1-related antigens are found in all nuclei of the embryo.
Fushi-tarazu Factor-1 (FTZ-F1) is a family of nuclear receptors involved in various developmental processes. We have cloned a zebrafish FTZ-F1 gene, termed ff1, which belongs to the fetoprotein transcription factor/liver receptor homologue-1 (FTF/LRH-1) subgroup of the FTZ-F1 family. Four transcripts arise as a result of differential promoter usage and alternative splicing at the 3'-most exons. The longer transcript, form A, encodes a transcriptional activator. The shorter transcript, form B, lacks the activation domain, and hence could not activate transcription. The difference in promoter usage generates FF1 proteins with different N-terminal sequences. All four transcripts appear to be expressed in most of the adult tissues, whereas, during embryo development, the IIA form is the predominant transcript. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and in situ hybridization experiments showed that the ff1 transcript is expressed in the hypothalamus, spinal cord, mandibular arch and digestive organs, including pancreas, liver, and intestine. The expression of ff1 in the digestive organs implies its function in gut development.
FTZ-F1 is a member of the orphan nuclear receptors, which belongs to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, and plays a role in the blastoderm and nervous system development in Drosophila. Recently, several FTZ-F1 family genes have been cloned in several species. SF-1/Ad4BPs have been identified as master regulators controlling steroidogenic P-450 genes in mammals and are considered to be the mammalian homologues of FTZ-F1. Moreover, SF-1/Ad4BP plays a critical role in the sexual differentiation of gonads in mammals. In vertebrates, except for mammals, the functional homologue of SF-1/Ad4BP has not been identified before. Herein, we cloned two chicken cDNAs (OR2.0 and OR2.1), which encode putative FTZ-F1 family receptors, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). OR2.1 consists of 3255 bp, is expressed in the adrenal glands and gonads, and is considered to be the chicken counterpart of mammalian SF-1/Ad4BP. However, OR2.0 consists of 2945 bp, is expressed in the livers and the adrenal glands, and is considered to be the chicken counterpart of mouse LRH-1, which is a member of the FTZ-F1 family in mammals.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a homolog of FTZ-F1, a transcription factor of the fruit fly, and belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor family. LRH-1 is expressed in organs derived from the endoderm, including intestine, liver and exocrine pancreas and plays a predominant role in development, bile-acid homeostasis, and reverse cholesterol transport. Recent research has revealed that mammalian LRH-1 is also expressed in the steroidogenic organs and has suggested that LRH-1 shares a role in steroidogenesis with steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), which is a paralog of LRH-1. In this study, we determined transcription initiation sites of chicken LRH-1 and showed that LRH-1 is expressed as several splicing variants in chicken steroidogenic organs. From three steroidogenic organs, the adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes, several cDNA fragments including different lengths and sequences were amplified by 5'-RACE and these were mainly classified into five types. Using these sequences, chicken genomic database was searched and four types of first exons were identified in chromosome 8. However, the database sequence of these regions included several gaps. So we cloned gap regions by PCR cloning from chicken genomic DNA and found the other type of first exons in the gaps. Moreover, RT-PCR showed the expression of LRH-1 in chicken steroidogenic organs as many splicing variants. We concluded that the chicken LRH-1 gene is transcribed from at least five different transcription initiation sites and alternative splicing produces several types of mRNA in steroidogenic organs.
The DNA-binding and ligand-binding functions of nuclear receptors are localized to independent domains separated by a flexible hinge. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the human liver receptor homologue-1 (hLRH-1), which controls genes central to development and metabolic homeostasis, interacts with monomeric DNA response elements and contains an Ftz-F1 motif that is unique to the NR5A nuclear receptor subfamily. Here, we present the 2.2A resolution crystal structure of the hLRH-1 DBD in complex with duplex DNA, and elucidate the sequence-specific DNA contacts essential for the ability of LRH-1 to bind to DNA as a monomer. We show that the unique Ftz-F1 domain folds into a novel helix that packs against the DBD but does not contact DNA. Mutations expected to disrupt the positioning of the Ftz-F1 helix do not eliminate DNA binding but reduce the transcriptional activity of full-length LRH-1 significantly. Moreover, we find that altering the Ftz-F1 helix positioning eliminates the enhancement of LRH-1-mediated transcription by the coactivator GRIP1, an action that is associated primarily with the distantly located ligand-binding domain (LBD). Taken together, these results indicate that subtle structural changes in a nuclear receptor DBD can exert long-range functional effects on the LBD of a receptor, and significantly impact transcriptional regulation.
A FTZ-F1 homologue was cloned from the pituitary cDNA library of the orange-spotted grouper. The full-length cDNA of the orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 spanned 1735 bp including a poly (A) tail. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 468 amino acids. Sequence analysis indicated that it had a structure typical of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily, and the FTZ-F1 box, a characteristic of the FTZ-F1 family. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 was closely related to medaka FTZ-F1 and did not belong to either the SF-1/Ad4BP group or the LRH-1/FTF group. Virtual Northern Blot detected a major transcript of about 1.7 kb and a minor transcript of 2.2 kb of FTZ-F1 in the orange-spotted grouper pituitary gland. The expression of FTZ-F1 homologue gene in different tissues and during embryonic development of the orange-spotted grouper was determined using one-step RT-PCR coupled with Southern blot analysis. In addition to the pituitary gland, the orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 was also expressed in the hypothalamus, forebrain, heart, liver, kidney, and ovary. The stronger signal from the gel image indicated that the expression level of FTZ-F1 homologue gene was higher in the ovary of stage 3 than stage 2. During embryonic development, mRNA for the orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 homologue was present in newly fertilized eggs, but disappeared in embryos at 50 min post fertilization. The orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 homologue mRNA reappeared in embryos at 1.5 hr post fertilization. Its expression level was increased from late blastula to neurula stages. Taken together, results of the current study suggest that the orange-spotted grouper FTZ-F1 homologue exhibits characteristics indicative of both the LRH-1/FTF- and the SF-1/Ad4BP-like genes, and may also play important roles in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, cholesterol metabolism, and embryogenesis.
The human nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (hLRH-1) plays an important role in the development of breast carcinomas. This orphan receptor is efficiently downregulated by the unusual co-repressor SHP and has been thought to be ligand-independent. We present the crystal structure at a resolution of 1.9 A of the ligand-binding domain of hLRH-1 in complex with the NR box 1 motif of human SHP, which we find contacts the AF-2 region of hLRH-1 using selective structural motifs. Electron density indicates phospholipid bound within the ligand-binding pocket, which we confirm using mass spectrometry of solvent-extracted samples. We further show that pocket mutations reduce phospholipid binding and receptor activity in vivo. Our results indicate that hLRH-1's control of gene expression is mediated by phospholipid binding, and establish hLRH-1 as a novel target for compounds designed to slow breast cancer development.
After ovulation, there is a shift in ovarian steroidogenesis from an estrogen-producing ovarian follicle to a progesterone-producing corpus luteum. The first step in human ovarian steroidogenesis is catalyzed by cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (CYP11A1) enzyme. Steroidogenic factor-1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates several steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP11A1. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is another orphan nuclear receptor that is expressed in the human ovary. After ovulation there is a down-regulation in steroidogenic factor-1, which is associated with an up-regulation of LRH-1 expression. These changes coincide with increased level of CYP11A1 expression in human corpus luteum. In this study, we examined the role of LRH-1 in the regulation of human granulosa cell CYP11A1 expression. Cotransfection of human granulosa cell tumor cells with CYP11A1 promoter and LRH-1 expression vector resulted in a significant increase in CYP11A1 expression. Deletion analysis revealed two putative LRH-1 binding sites at -1580 and -40, which was confirmed by EMSA. Dosage-sensitive sex-reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene-1 inhibited LRH-1 stimulated CYP11A1 expression, and that was not overcome by the presence of PKA agonist. We conclude that CYP11A1 expression in human granulosa cells is regulated by LRH-1. We propose that LRH-1 could be the major transcription factor for the post-ovulatory surge in human ovarian steroidogenesis.
The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) has been reported to play a role in bile acid biosynthesis and reverse cholesterol transport. In this study, we examined the role of LRH-1 in the regulation of the apolipoprotein AI (APOAI) gene. Using RNA interference and adenovirus-mediated overexpression, we show that LRH-1 directly regulates APOAI gene transcription. Transient transfection experiments and EMSAs revealed that LRH-1 directly regulates APOAI transcription by binding to an LRH-1 response element located in the proximal APOAI promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LRH-1 binds to the human APO AI promoter in vivo. Finally, we show that the transcriptional repressor SHP (small heterodimer partner) suppressed APOAI gene expression by inhibiting LRH-1 transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LRH-1 is a novel regulator of APOAI transcription and underscore the role of this receptor in cholesterol homeostasis.
The ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 facilitate biliary and intestinal removal of neutral sterols. Here, we identify a binding site for the orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) at nt 134-142 of the ABCG5/ABCG8 intergenic region necessary for the activity of both the ABCG5 and ABCG8 promoters. Mutating this LRH-1 binding site reduced promoter activity of the human ABCG5/ABCG8 intergenic region more than 7-fold in HepG2 and Caco2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with HepG2 nuclear extracts demonstrated specific binding of LRH-1 to the LRH-1 binding motif in the human ABCG5/ABCG8 intergenic region. LRH-1 overexpression increased promoter activity up to 1.6-fold and 3-fold in Caco2 and 293 cells, respectively. Finally, deoxycholic acid repressed the ABCG5 and ABCG8 promoters, consistent with bile acid regulation via the farnesoid X receptor-small heterodimeric partner-LRH-1 pathway. These results demonstrate that LRH-1 is a positive transcription factor for ABCG5 and ABCG8 and, in conjunction with studies on LRH-1 activation of other promoters, identify LRH-1 as a "master regulator" for genes involved in sterol and bile acid secretion from liver and intestine.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor believed to play a key role in bile acid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and intestinal cell crypt renewal. LRH-1 has recently been reported to negatively regulate the hepatic acute phase response by antagonizing, at least in part, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein signaling pathway. Here we have shown, using adenovirus-mediated LRH-1 overexpression and gene-silencing experiments, that the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) gene is a novel LRH-1 target gene in hepatic cells. Promoter mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LRH-1 regulates IL-1RA gene expression under inflammatory conditions at the transcriptional level via the binding to an LRH-1 response element. Interestingly, IL-1RA induction by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide is significantly lower in LRH-1 heterozygous compared with wild-type mice, demonstrating the contribution of LRH-1 in IL-1RA gene regulation. Finally, RNA interference experiments indicate that LRH-1 blocks the hepatic acute phase response by, at least in part, inducing IL-1RA expression. Taken together, these results lead to the identification of IL-1RA as a novel LRH-1 target gene and demonstrate the existence of multiple mechanisms contributing to the overall anti-inflammatory properties of LRH-1 in hepatic cells.
Cancers, including that of the breast, are the result of multiple contributing factors including aberrant gene expression. Indeed, the CYP19 gene encoding P450 aromatase, the key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis, is up-regulated in breast tumors predominantly via the cAMP-responsive gonad-type PII promoter, ultimately leading to increased intratumoral estrogen production and tumor growth. Thus, identifying the molecular factors involved in aromatase PII promoter regulation is essential for our understanding and treatment of the disease. Because we have previously shown activity of the murine aromatase PII promoter to be markedly up-regulated by GATA factors with respect to the gonads, we hypothesized that GATA factors are also key determinants of human PII promoter-driven aromatase transcription in breast tumors. We now show that GATA3 and GATA4 are indeed expressed in several breast cancer cells lines. Consistent with the cAMP dependence of the PII promoter, activation elicited by GATA3 or GATA4 alone and the striking synergism between GATA3 or GATA4 and the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1 was intimately linked to forskolin treatment or overexpression of protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit. PKA-mediated phosphorylation increases the interaction between GATA3 and LRH-1 and the requirement for PKA in aromatase PII promoter stimulation involves at least three specific amino acid residues: GATA3 Ser308, GATA4 Ser261, and LRH-1 Ser469. Finally, we show that the human LRH-1 promoter is itself a target for GATA factors. Thus, taken together, our results suggest that GATA factors likely contribute to aberrant aromatase expression in breast tumors through two distinct, yet complementary mechanisms.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor previously known to have distinct functions during mouse development and essential roles in cholesterol homeostasis. Recently, a new role for LRH-1 has been discovered in tumor progression, giving LRH-1 potential transforming functions. In order to identify critical factors stimulating LRH-1 expression leading to deregulated cellular proliferation, we studied its expression and its regulation in several breast cancer cell lines. We observed that LRH-1 expression was increased in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha expressing cell lines, whereas weak-to-no expression was found in nonexpressing ERalpha cell lines. In MCF7, LRH-1 expression was highly induced after treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2). This transcriptional regulation was the result of a direct binding of the ER to the LRH-1 promoter, as demonstrated by gelshift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated inactivation of LRH-1 decreased the E2-dependent proliferation of MCF7 cells. Finally, LRH-1 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in tumor cells of human mammary ductal carcinomas. Altogether, these data demonstrate that LRH-1 is transcriptionally regulated by the ER alpha and reinforce the hypothesis that LRH-1 could exert potential oncogenic effects during breast cancer formation.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) or Ad4BP is a member of the fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) family and an orphan nuclear receptor that plays an important role in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and the adrenal cortex. Although its critical role in the differentiation of adrenals, gonads, and pituitary gonadotropes has been well demonstrated, regulatory function of SF-1 during sexual maturation is yet to be examined. To investigate the potential role of SF-1 in sexual maturation, expression of two salmon FTZ-F1 homolog genes, sFF1-I and sFF1-II, was examined in the pituitaries of chum and sockeye salmons, using specific and sensitive RNase protection assays. Only sFF1-I mRNA was found in the pituitary and other organs, such as the ovary, spleen, liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. In chum salmon during upstream migration from the bay to the hatchery, the level of sFF1-I mRNA in the male fish was increased on the midway in the river, where the levels of gonadotropin alpha- and II beta-subunit mRNAs were increased. In maturing sockeye salmon, the expression of the sFF1-I gene was elevated in the mature male fish, but the administration of GnRH analog did not further enhance the expression. These results indicate that sFF1-I gene expression in the pituitary is upregulated in maturing salmon, and this upregulation may not depend on GnRH.
Glucocorticoids (GC) are steroid hormones with important implications in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. At the same time GC are known to have numerous side-effects. Endogenous GC are predominantly produced by the adrenal glands, and adrenal-derived GC serve important functions in the regulation of development, metabolism, and immune regulation. The last two decades of research have led to the identification of numerous alternative sources of extra-adrenal GC synthesis. Among other tissues the intestine and lung are capable of locally producing considerable amounts of immunoregulatory GC. This local steroidogenesis in these mucosal tissues appears to be regulated by transcription factors and mediators different from those in the adrenals, likely reflecting an adaptation to the local requirements and conditions. Here we summarize the current knowledge about the extra-adrenal GC synthesis in the mucosal tissues, with special emphasis on the intestinal epithelium, and its implication on the regulation of immune homeostasis and inflammatory processes.
In the ovary, the follicular granulosa cells express the nuclear receptor Nr5a2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 2), also known as liver receptor homolog-1, and after ovulation, Nr5a2 expression persists in the corpus luteum. Previous studies demonstrated that Nr5a2 is required for both ovulation and luteal steroid synthesis. Our objectives were to analyze the temporal sequence in the regulatory effects of Nr5a2 in the ovary, with focus on its contribution to luteal function. We developed a female mouse model of granulosa-specific targeted disruption from the formation of the antral follicles forward (genotype Nr5a2(Cyp19-/-)). Mice lacking Nr5a2 in granulosa cells of antral follicles are infertile. Although their cumulus cells undergo expansion after gonadotropin stimulation, ovulation is disrupted in those mice, at least in part, due to the down-regulation of the progesterone receptor (Pgr) gene. The depletion of Nr5a2 in antral follicles permits formation of luteal-like structures but not functional corpora lutea, as evidenced by reduced progesterone levels and failure to support pseudopregnancy. Progesterone synthesis is affected by depletion of Nr5a2 due to, among others, defects in the transport of cholesterol, evidenced by down-regulation of Scarb1, Ldlr, and Star. Comparison of this mouse line with the models in which Nr5a2 is depleted from the primary follicle forward (genotype Nr5a2(Amhr2-/-)) and after the ovulatory signal (genotype Nr5a2(Pgr-/-)) demonstrates that Nr5a2 differentially regulates female fertility across the trajectory of follicular development. 
Androgens play a major role in the regulation of normal ovarian function; however, they are also involved in the development of ovarian pathologies. These contrasting effects may involve a differential response of granulosa cells to the androgens testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). To determine the molecular pathways that mediate the distinct effects of T and DHT, we studied the expression of the liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) gene, which is differentially regulated by these steroids. We found that although both T and DHT stimulate androgen receptor (AR) binding to the LRH-1 promoter, DHT prevents T-mediated stimulation of LRH-1 expression. T stimulated the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its interaction with the AR. T also promoted the recruitment of the AR/AHR complex to the LRH-1 promoter. These effects were not mimicked by DHT. We also observed that the activation of extracellular regulated kinases by T is required for AR and AHR interaction. In summary, T, but not DHT, stimulates AHR expression and the interaction between AHR and AR, leading to the stimulation of LRH-1 expression. These findings could explain the distinct response of granulosa cells to T and DHT and provide a molecular mechanism by which DHT negatively affects ovarian function. 
The differential expression and secretion of the neuropeptide kisspeptin from neurons in the arcuate (Arc) and anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nuclei of the hypothalamus coordinate the temporal release of pituitary gonadotropins that control the female reproductive cycle. However, the molecular basis for this differential regulation is incompletely understood. Here, we report that liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is expressed in kisspeptin neurons in the Arc but not in the AVPV in female mice. LRH-1 binds directly to the kisspeptin (Kiss1) promoter and stimulates Kiss1 transcription. Deletion of LRH-1 from kisspeptin neurons in mice decreased Kiss1 expression in the Arc, leading to reduced plasma FSH levels, dysregulated follicle maturation, and prolongation of the estrous cycle. Conversely, overexpression of LRH-1 in kisspeptin neurons increased Arc Kiss1 expression and plasma FSH concentrations. These studies provide a molecular basis for the differential regulation of basal kisspeptin expression in Arc and AVPV neurons and reveal a prominent role for LRH-1 in hypothalamus in regulating the female reproductive axis.
Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1; adrenodoxin) is an iron-sulfur protein that is involved in various metabolic processes, including steroid hormone synthesis in mammalian tissues. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of FDX1 in ovarian granulosa cells. Previously, we reported that the NR5A family, including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 could induce differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into steroidogenic cells. A ChIP assay showed that SF-1 could bind to the FDX1 promoter in differentiated hMSCs. Luciferase reporter assays showed that transcription of FDX1 was synergistically activated by the NR5A family and 8Br-cAMP treatment through two SF-1 binding sites and a CRE-like sequence in a human ovarian granulosa cell line, KGN. Knockdown of FDX1 attenuated progesterone production in KGN cells. These results indicate transcription of FDX1 is regulated by the NR5A family and cAMP signaling, and participates in steroid hormone production in ovarian granulosa cells.
We have determined the cistrome and transcriptome for the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in exocrine pancreas. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that LRH-1 directly induces expression of genes encoding digestive enzymes and secretory and mitochondrial proteins. LRH-1 cooperates with the pancreas transcription factor 1-L complex (PTF1-L) in regulating exocrine pancreas-specific gene expression. Elimination of LRH-1 in adult mice reduced the concentration of several lipases and proteases in pancreatic fluid and impaired pancreatic fluid secretion in response to cholecystokinin. Thus, LRH-1 is a key regulator of the exocrine pancreas-specific transcriptional network required for the production and secretion of pancreatic fluid.
Androgens are crucial for normal folliculogenesis and female fertility as evidenced in androgen receptor-null and granulosa cell conditional knockout mice. It is thought, however, that the multiple effects of androgens in the ovary are mainly complementary to the actions of gonadotropins. Using primary rat granulosa cells, we demonstrated that in the absence of gonadotropins, testosterone (T) increases aromatase (Cyp19) and P450 side-change cleavage expression, two enzymes crucial for normal ovarian function. T can be converted into estradiol, a classical estrogen, by Cyp19 and into 5α-dihydrotestosterone, a pure androgen, by 5α-reductase. However, inhibition of Cyp19 and/or 5α-reductase did not prevent the stimulatory effects of T. In contrast, the effect of this steroid was potentiated by blocking 5α-reductase. Additionally, T, not 5α-dihydrotestosterone, stimulates liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) expression, whereas the expression of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) was not affected by either steroid. LRH-1 and SF-1 are transcription factors known to be involved in the regulation of Cyp19. Accordingly, small interference RNA against LRH-1 prevented Cyp19 and P450 side-change cleavage up-regulation whereas anti-SF-1 small interference RNA had no effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that T stimulation of LRH-1 leads to the recruitment of LRH-1 to the native Cyp19 promoter, which was not affected by cotreatment with 5α-reductase and Cyp19 inhibitors. Finally, gel shift and supershift analysis demonstrated that the androgen receptor binds to an androgen response element located within the LRH-1 promoter. These results provide novel evidence that T has a direct effect on the expression of genes involved in granulosa cell differentiation.
Dax1 (Nr0b1) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that has recently been shown to play a role in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell pluripotency. Here we describe a mechanism by which Dax1 maintains pluripotency. In steroidogenic cells, Dax1 protein interacts with the NR5A nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (Nr5a1) to inhibit transcription of target genes. In mES cells, liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1, Nr5a2), the other NR5A family member, is expressed, and LRH-1 has been shown to interact with Dax1. We demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation that Dax1 is, indeed, able to form a complex with LRH-1 in mES cells. Because Dax1 was historically characterized as an inhibitor of steroidogenic factor 1-mediated transcriptional activation, we hypothesized that Dax1 would inhibit LRH-1 action in mES cells. Therefore, we examined the effect of Dax1 on the LRH-1-mediated activation of the critical ES cell factor Oct4 (Pou5f1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation localized Dax1 to the Oct4 promoter at the LRH-1 binding site, and luciferase assays together with Dax1 overexpression and knockdown experiments revealed that, rather than repress, Dax1 accentuated LRH-1-mediated activation of the Oct4 gene. Similar to our previously published studies that defined the RNA coactivator steroid receptor RNA activator as the critical mediator of Dax1 coactivation function, Dax1 augmentation of LRH-1-mediated Oct4 activation is dependent upon steroid receptor RNA activator. Finally, utilizing published chromatin immunoprecipitation data of whole-genome binding sites of LRH-1 and Dax1, we show that LRH-1 and Dax1 commonly colocalize at 288 genes (43% of LRH-1 target genes), many of which are involved in mES cell pluripotency. Thus, our results indicate that Dax1 plays an important role in the maintenance of pluripotency in mES cells through interaction with LRH-1 and transcriptional activation of Oct4 and other genes.
Delineating the signaling pathways that underlie ESC pluripotency is paramount for development of ESC applications in both the research and clinical settings. In culture pluripotency is maintained by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) stimulation of two separate signaling axes: Stat3/Klf4/Sox2 and PI3K/Tbx3/Nanog, which converge in the regulation of Oct4 expression. However, LIF signaling is not required in vivo for self-renewal, thus alternate signaling axes likely mediate these pathways. Additional factors that promote pluripotency gene expression have been identified, including the direct regulation of Oct4 by liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) and β-catenin regulation of Nanog. Here, we present genetic, molecular, and pharmacological studies identifying a signaling axis in which β-catenin promotes pluripotency gene expression in an Lrh-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, Lrh-1 was identified as a novel β-catenin target gene, and Lrh-1 regulation is required for maintaining proper levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Tbx3. Elucidation of this pathway provides an alternate mechanism by which the primary pluripotency axis may be regulated in vivo and may pave the way for small molecule applications to manipulate pluripotency or improve the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming.
Orphan nuclear receptor fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) was previously identified as a specific regulator of the alpha(1)-fetoprotein gene during early liver development and in response to hormonal signals (L. Galarneau, J.-F. Paré, D. Allard, D. Hamel, L. Lévesque, J. D. Tugwood, S. Green, and L. Bélanger, Mol. Cell. Biol. 16:3853-3865, 1996). Here we report a functional analysis of FTF interactions with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleocapsid promoter. DNA-protein-binding assays show that the HBV core promoter contains two high-affinity FTF-binding sites and a third, lower-affinity site shared with other receptors. Transfections in HepG2, Hep3B, and PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes with the nucleocapsid promoter linked or not linked to enhancer I indicate that FTF is a potent activator of the HBV core promoter, more efficient than HNF4alpha, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, or C/EBPalpha. Steroidogenic factor 1, a close FTF homolog which binds to the same DNA motif and is expressed ectopically in HepG2 cells, seems to be an even stronger inducer than FTF. Point mutations of the FTF-binding sites indicate direct FTF activatory effects on the core promoter and the use of both high-affinity sites for productive interaction between the core promoter and enhancer I. Coexpression assays further indicate that FTF and HNF4alpha are the most efficient partners for coactivation of the pregenomic core promoter, which may largely account for the hepatic tropism and the early amplification of HBV infection. Carboxy terminus-truncated FTF behaves as a dominant negative mutant to compete all three FTF sites and strongly deactivate core promoter interactions with enhancer I; this suggests possible new ways to interfere with HBV infection.
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in steroidogenic tissues and, thus, facilitates cholesterol availability for steroidogenesis. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) controls the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. However, the modes of action of HSL in the regulation of StAR expression remain obscure. We demonstrate in MA-10 mouse Leydig cells that activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, by a cAMP analog Bt2cAMP, enhanced expression of HSL and its phosphorylation (P) at Ser-660 and Ser-563, but not at Ser-565, concomitant with increased HSL activity. Phosphorylation and activation of HSL coincided with increases in StAR, P-StAR (Ser-194), and progesterone levels. Inhibition of HSL activity by CAY10499 effectively suppressed Bt2cAMP-induced StAR expression and progesterone synthesis. Targeted silencing of endogenous HSL, with siRNAs, resulted in increased cholesteryl ester levels and decreased cholesterol content in MA-10 cells. Depletion of HSL affected lipoprotein-derived cellular cholesterol influx, diminished the supply of cholesterol to the mitochondria, and resulted in the repression of StAR and P-StAR levels. Cells overexpressing HSL increased the efficacy of liver X receptor (LXR) ligands on StAR expression and steroid synthesis, suggesting HSL-mediated steroidogenesis entails enhanced oxysterol production. Conversely, cells deficient in LXRs exhibited decreased HSL responsiveness. Furthermore, an increase in HSL was correlated with the LXR target genes, steroid receptor element-binding protein 1c and ATP binding cassette transporter A1, demonstrating HSL-dependent regulation of steroidogenesis predominantly involves LXR signaling. LXRs interact/cooperate with RXRs and result in the activation of StAR gene transcription. These findings provide novel insight and demonstrate the molecular events by which HSL acts to drive cAMP/PKA-mediated regulation of StAR expression and steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells.
Interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-12 synergize for the production of interferon (IFN)-γ, which can downregulate ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of IL-18 and/or IL-12 on ABCA1 expression.
IL-18 combined with IL-12 decreased ABCA1 expression and cellular cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells, whereas IL-18 or IL-12 alone had no effect. IL-12 increased IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) expression, which was suppressed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. IL-18R but not IL-12 receptor siRNA completely reversed the effects of IL-18 and IL-12 on ABCA1 expression and cellular cholesterol efflux. Treatment with IL-18 plus IL-12 markedly augmented nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB but had no effect on expression and activity of liver X receptor α. IL-18 and IL-12 also significantly increased zinc finger protein 202 (ZNF202) levels and IFN-γ secretion. Furthermore, siRNA for ZNF202 or IFN-γ significantly impaired IL-18/IL-12-induced suppression of ABCA1, whereas NF-κB siRNA treatment blocked IL-18/IL-12' action on ZNF202 levels, IFN-γ secretion, and ABCA1 expression.
IL-18 and IL-12 together can decrease ABCA1 expression and cellular cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells through the IL-18R/NF-κB signaling pathway.
Migration of CD4-positive lymphocytes into the vessel wall is a critical step in atherogenesis. Recent data suggest that CD4-positive lymphocytes express the nuclear transcription factors Liver-X-Receptor (LXR) alpha and beta with an effect of LXR activators on TH1-cytokine release from these cells. However, the role of LXR in lymphocyte migration remains currently unexplored. Therefore, the present study investigated whether LXR activation might modulate chemokine-induced migration of these cells. Stimulation of CD4-positive lymphocytes with SDF-1 leads to a 2.5 +/- 0.8-fold increase in cell migration (P &lt; 0.05; n = 12). Pretreatment of cells with the LXR activator T0901317 reduces this effect in a concentration-dependent manner to a maximal 0.9 +/- 0.4-fold induction at 1 micromol/L T0901317 (P &lt; 0.05 compared to SDF-1-treated cells; n = 12). Similar results were obtained with the LXR activator GW3965. The effect of LXR activators on CD4-positive lymphocyte migration was mediated through an early inhibition of chemokine-induced PI-3 kinase activity as determined by PI-3 kinase activity assays. Downstream, T0901317 inhibited activation of the small GTPase Rac and phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC). Moreover, LXR activator treatment reduced f-actin formation as well as ICAM3 translocation to the uropod of the cell, thus interfering with two important steps in T cell migration. Transfection of CD4-positive lymphocytes with LXRalpha/beta siRNA abolished T0901317 inhibitory effect on MLC phosphorylation and ICAM3 translocation. LXR activation by T0901317 or GW3965 inhibits chemokine-induced migration of CD4-positive lymphocytes. Given the crucial importance of chemokine-induced T cell migration in early atherogenesis, LXR activators may be promising tools to modulate this effect.
ABCA12 (ATP binding cassette transporter, family 12) is a cellular membrane transporter that facilitates the delivery of glucosylceramides to epidermal lamellar bodies in keratinocytes, a process that is critical for permeability barrier formation. Following secretion of lamellar bodies into the stratum corneum, glucosylceramides are metabolized to ceramides, which comprise approximately 50% of the lipid in stratum corneum. Gene mutations of ABCA12 underlie harlequin ichthyosis, a devastating skin disorder characterized by abnormal lamellar bodies and a severe barrier abnormality. Recently we reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor activators increase ABCA12 expression in human keratinocytes. Here we demonstrate that ceramide (C(2)-Cer and C(6)-Cer), but not C(8)-glucosylceramides, sphingosine, or ceramide 1-phosphate, increases ABCA12 mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase, sphingomyelin synthase, and ceramidase and small interfering RNA knockdown of human alkaline ceramidase, which all increase endogenous ceramide levels, also increased ABCA12 mRNA levels. Moreover, simultaneous treatment with C(6)-Cer and each of these same inhibitors additively increased ABCA12 expression, indicating that ceramide is an important inducer of ABCA12 expression and that the conversion of ceramide to other sphingolipids or metabolites is not required. Finally, both exogenous and endogenous ceramides preferentially stimulate PPARdelta expression (but not other PPARs or liver X receptors), whereas PPARdelta knockdown by siRNA transfection specifically diminished the ceramide-induced increase in ABCA12 mRNA levels, indicating that PPARdelta is a mediator of the ceramide effect. Together, these results show that ceramide, an important lipid component of epidermis, up-regulates ABCA12 expression via the PPARdelta-mediated signaling pathway, providing a substrate-driven, feed-forward mechanism for regulating this key lipid transporter.
Fibrates, including fenofibrate, exert their biological effects by binding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Treatment with PPARalpha agonists enhances fatty acid oxidation, decreases plasma triglycerides, and may promote reverse cholesterol transport. In addition, fibrate administration can reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption in patients, although the molecular mechanism for this effect is unknown. Because Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is already known to be a critical protein for cholesterol absorption, we hypothesized that fenofibrate might modulate NPC1L1 expression to alter intestinal cholesterol transport. Here, we find that fenofibrate-treated wild-type mice have decreased fractional cholesterol absorption (35-47% decrease) and increased fecal neutral sterol excretion (51-83% increase), which correspond to decreased expression of NPC1L1 mRNA and protein (38-66% decrease) in the proximal small intestine. These effects of fenofibrate are dependent on PPARalpha, as Ppar alpha-knockout mice fail to respond like wild-type littermates. Fenofibrate affects the ezetimibe-sensitive pathway and retains the ability to decrease cholesterol absorption and NPC1L1 mRNA expression in chow-fed liver X receptor alpha/beta-double-knockout mice and high-cholesterol- or cholic acid-fed wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that fenofibrate specifically acts via PPARalpha to decrease cholesterol absorption at the level of intestinal NPC1L1 expression.
The development of atherosclerotic disease results from the interaction between environment and genetic make up. A key factor in atherogenesis is the oxidative modification of lipids, which is involved in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes to the arterial intima--a process regulated by several groups of adhesion molecules and cytokines. Activated leukocytes, as well as endothelial mitochondria, can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are associated with endothelial dysfunction, a cause of reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity and further ROS production. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and liver X receptors (LXR) are nuclear receptors significantly involved in the control of lipid metabolism, inflammation and insulin sensitivity. Also, an emerging role has been suggested for G protein coupled receptors and for the small Ras and Rho GTPases in the regulation of the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and of tissue factor, which are involved in thrombus formation and modulation of vascular tone. Further, the interactions among eNOS, cholesterol, oxidated LDL and caveola membranes are probably involved in some molecular changes observed in vascular diseases. Despite the relevance of oxidative processes in atherogenesis, anti-oxidants have failed to significantly improve atherosclerosis (ATS) prevention, while statins have proved to be the most successful drugs.
Affymetrix microarray data and Northern blot assays demonstrated that phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was induced 6-fold when either murine or human macrophages were incubated in the presence of ligands for the liver X receptor (LXR) and the retinoid X receptor. Two functional LXR response elements (LXREs) were identified and characterized in the proximal promoter of the human PLTP gene. One LXRE corresponds to a traditional direct repeat separated by 4 bp. However, the second LXRE is novel in that it corresponds to an inverted repeat separated by 1 bp, and is identical to the farnesoid X receptor response element. These studies demonstrate that PLTP is a direct target for activated LXR and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In addition, apolipoprotein E (apoE), a known LXR target gene in macrophages, was shown to be activated in liver cells by FXR ligands. Taken together, the current data suggest that a small number of genes that currently include PLTP, apoE, and apoC-II, are induced in macrophages by activated LXR and in liver by activated FXR.
A potent, selective, orally active LXR agonist was identified from focused libraries of tertiary amines. GW3965 (12) recruits the steroid receptor coactivator 1 to human LXRalpha in a cell-free ligand-sensing assay with an EC(50) of 125 nM and profiles as a full agonist on hLXRalpha and hLXRbeta in cell-based reporter gene assays with EC(50)'s of 190 and 30 nM, respectively. After oral dosing at 10 mg/kg to C57BL/6 mice, 12 increased expression of the reverse cholesterol transporter ABCA1 in the small intestine and peripheral macrophages and increased the plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol by 30%. 12 will be a valuable chemical tool to investigate the role of LXR in the regulation of reverse cholesterol transport and lipid metabolism.
Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 play crucial roles in reverse cholesterol transport, and have anti-atherosclerosis effects, and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) can stimulate cholesterol efflux through these transporters. Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) can protect endothelial cells, inhibit smooth muscle cell growth, ameliorate inflammation and exert anti-atherosclerotic effects. In the present study, we attempted to clarify the effect of Ang-(1-7) on expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, and explored the role of LXRα in the regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in THP-1 macrophages that had been incubated with angiotensin-II (AngII). Ang-(1-7) increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner at both the mRNA and protein levels, promoted cholesterol efflux, and decreased cholesterol content in THP-1 macrophages treated with AngII. Furthermore, Ang-(1-7) upregulated the expression of LXRα in a concentration-dependent manner in these cells. LXRα small interfering RNA, as well as the Mas receptor antagonist A-779, completely abolished these effects of Ang-(1-7). In summary, Ang-(1-7) upregulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in THP-1 macrophages treated with AngII through the Mas receptor, via the LXRα pathway. This novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying Ang-(1-7) and AngII interaction could prove useful for developing new strategies for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The CD36 selective ligand, EP 80317, features potent anti-atherosclerotic and hypocholesterolemic effects that are associated with an increase in macrophage cholesterol efflux through the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-liver X receptor α (LXRα)-ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pathway. Cholesterol efflux is the first step of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). However, whether EP 80317 exerts its hypocholesterolemic and anti-atherosclerotic activity through RCT in vivo has yet to be determined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EP 80317 on RCT, in particular on macrophage-to-feces RCT and the expression of selected genes associated with hepatic cholesterol metabolism and intestinal cholesterol transport.
Reverse cholesterol transport was assessed following the intraperitoneal injection of [(3)H]-cholesterol-labelled J774 macrophages to hypercholesterolemic apoE- and apoE/CD36 double-deficient mice that had been treated for 12 weeks with EP 80317. Forty-eight hours after the administration of [(3)H]-cholesterol-labelled cells, blood, liver, intestines and feces were harvested. The radioactivity recovered in the feces (cholesterol and bile acid combined) was significantly increased by 311% (P = 0.0259) in EP 80317-treated mice compared with that found in vehicle-treated mice despite no significant change in [(3)H]-tracer recovery in plasma between groups. Whereas the mRNA levels of LXRα in the gut were significantly upregulated, mRNA and protein levels of the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) transporter, a LXRα target which regulates intestinal cholesterol absorption, were downregulated in EP 80317-treated mice. In contrast, neither mRNA nor protein levels of investigated transporters and receptors were modulated in the small intestine of double-deficient mice, nor was the fecal recovery of radioactivity. No change was observed in targeted genes in liver of either apoE- or apoE/CD36 double-deficient mice after a chronic treatment with EP 80317.
This study shows that EP 80317 elicits macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport in a manner dependent on CD36 expression. This effect is associated with the upregulation of LXRα and the downregulation of NPC1L1 expression.
Angiotensin II (Ang II) regulates the expression of some core clock genes; excess Ang II leads to atherosclerosis advancement. Macrophage Rev-erbα mediates clockwork and inflammation, and plays a role in atherosclerotic lesion progression. However, the role of Ang II in regulating Rev-erbα expression in macrophages remains unclarified.
We induced THP-1 macrophages by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and investigated the effect of Ang II on Rev-erbα expression via real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and small interfering RNA (siRNA) techniques. The cytotoxicity of the Rev-erbα agonist SR9009 was analyzed using a (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl])-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
Ang II suppressed Rev-erbα mRNA and protein expression in THP-1 macrophages in a dose and time dependent manner. This effect was mediated via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), and not Ang II type 2 receptor or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Consistent with Rev-erbα expression regulated by Ang II, the liver X receptor α (LXRα) protein expression was downregulated in a time-dependent manner after Ang II treatment. The activation or silence of LXRα significantly increased or decreased Rev-erbα expression regulated by Ang II, respectively. This suggests that LXRα is involved in the effect of Ang II on Rev-erbα expression. MMP-9 mRNA expressions were significantly suppressed by SR9009 in THP-1 and RAW264.7 macrophages; moreover, SR9009-treatment significantly reduced Ang II-induced MMP-9 protein expressions in two types of macrophages.
Ang II downregulates Rev-erbα expression in THP-1 macrophages via the AT1R/LXRα pathway.
Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. We hypothesized that nagilactone B (NLB), a small molecule extracted from the root bark of Podocarpus nagi (Podocarpaceae), suppresses atherosclerosis in an atherosclerotic mouse model.
Male apoE-deficient mice on C57BL/6J background received NLB (10 and 30 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. Compared with the model group, NLB treatment (10 and 30 mg/kg) significantly reduced en face lesions of total aorta areas. In RAW264.7 cells, NLB significantly ameliorated cholesterol accumulation in macrophages via enhancing apolipoprotein A-I and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Mechanistically, NLB induced messenger RNA and protein expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells. Liver X receptor (LXR) site mutations in the mouse ABCA1 promoter abrogated NLB-mediated luciferase reporter activity. LXRα and LXRβ small interfering RNA suppressed NLB-mediated induction of ABCA1 expression. Consistent with in vitro results, NLB induced ABCA1 expression and suppressed macrophage areas in the aortic sinus. Moreover, NLB treatment did not induce the protein expression of LXR in liver. Hepatic and intestinal cholesterol accumulation was significantly alleviated on NLB treatment. Besides, NLB significantly improved plasma lipid profiles in apoE-deficient mice.
Selective LXR activation in macrophages with NLB induces ABCA1- and ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux while exerting minimal effects on lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in liver, resulting in regression of atherosclerosis, and therefore might be a promising strategy for therapeutics.
The nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) exerts transcriptional control over lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in cells of the myeloid lineage, suggesting that LXR may be a potential target in a number of chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases where persistent microglial activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis.
The effect of LXR activation on microglia and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation was studied using a synthetic LXR agonist in cultured microglia, a microglial cell line and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of CNS inflammation.
LXR activation inhibited nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible (Nos2) expression and nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia. Inhibition of microglial activation in response to interferon-γ was less reliable. In LPS-stimulated cells, LXR activation did not inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB1 p50. Instead, LXR-dependent Nos2 repression was associated with inhibition of histone 4 acetylation and inhibition of NF-kappaB1 p50 binding at the Nos2 promoter. Histone acetylation and NF-kappaB1 p50 binding were mechanistically linked, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity appeared to be important for LXR-dependent transcriptional repression of Nos2. Analysis of CNS gene expression in animals undergoing EAE showed that the expressions of Lxr and LXR-dependent genes were downregulated during CNS inflammation. Nevertheless, administration of LXR agonist GW3965 during the effector phase of EAE delayed the onset of clinical disease and reversed the diminished expression of LXR-dependent reverse cholesterol transport genes. However, the CNS expressions of Nos2 and other inflammatory genes were not significantly inhibited by LXR activation in EAE, and clinical disease severity was comparable to vehicle controls at later time points in LXR agonist treated animals.
LXR can be targeted to modulate microglial activation. LXR-dependent repression of inflammatory genes may be stimulus-dependent and impaired by HDAC inhibition. Endogenous LXR activity does not appear to modulate CNS inflammation, but LXR activity can be partially restored in the CNS by administration of exogenous LXR agonist with an impact on clinical disease severity at early, but not late, time points in EAE.
Methylophaga spp. are methylotrophs commonly associated with marine environments and have been defined as strict aerobic methylotrophs. They have been shown previously to represent 50-70% of the bacterial population in the biofilm of the methanol-fed denitrification reactor treating a large seawater aquarium at the Montreal Biodome. It was therefore surprising to find such a high concentration of Methylophaga spp. in anoxic conditions. In this study, we showed by cultivation-independent and -dependent approaches that one Methylophaga strain present in the anoxic biofilm is involved in the denitrification process. DNA stable-isotope probing (SIP) experiments in which the biofilm was cultured under denitrifying conditions with (13)C-methanol have revealed the enrichment of one particular taxon. By screening a 16S ribosomal RNA gene library derived from a (13)C-DNA fraction of the SIP gradients, 62% of the library was composed of one sequence affiliated with the genus Methylophaga. One strain, named JAM1, representing this Methylophaga species was isolated. It grows aerobically but also under denitrifying conditions by reducing nitrate into nitrite. The nitrate-reducing activity was correlated with the presence and the expression of two highly divergent narG genes (narG1 and narG2). narG1 showed a high percentage of identity with the corresponding part of narG found in Thiobacillus denitrificans, which suggests a recent acquisition of narG in strain JAM1 by horizontal gene transfer. This study provides the first direct evidence of the adaptation of a Methylophaga species to an oxygen-limited environment.
Estrogen signaling is pivotal in the progression of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer primarily by the regulation of cell survival and proliferation. Micro (mi)RNAs have been demonstrated to be regulated by estrogen to mediate estrogenic effects. Herein, we determined the role of estrogen regulated miR-26 and its underlying molecular mechanisms associated with estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer proliferation.
The expression of miR-26a and miR-26b was evaluated by real-time quantitative (RT)-PCR. The expression of miR-26a or miR-26b was modulated in ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D) and tumor cell growth in vitro and an in vivo xenograft model was determined. Bioinformatics analyses were utilized to screen for estrogen responsive genes, which were also predicted to be targeted by miR-26. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm miR-26 regulation of the 3' UTR of target genes. The levels of miR-26 target genes (CHD1, GREB1 and KPNA2) were evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
Estrogen reduced the expression of miR-26a and miR-26b in ER+ breast cancer cells. Forced expression of miR-26a or miR-26b significantly inhibited the estrogen stimulated growth of ER+ breast cancer cells and tumor growth in xenograft models, whereas miR-26a/b depletion increased the growth of ER+ breast cancer cells in the absence of estrogen treatment. Screening of estrogen responsive genes, which were also predicted to be targeted by miR-26, identified GREB1 and nine other genes (AGPAT5, AMMECR1, CHD1, ERLIN1, HSPA8, KPNA2, MREG, NARG1, and PLOD2). Further verification has identified nine genes (AGPAT5, CHD1, ERLIN1, GREB1, HSPA8, KPNA2, MREG, NARG1 and PLOD2) which were directly targeted by miR-26 via their 3' UTR. Functional screening suggested only three estrogen regulated miR-26 target genes (CHD1, GREB1 and KPNA2) were involved in the regulation of estrogen promoted cell proliferation. Depletion of either CHD1, GREB1 or KPNA2 significantly abrogated the enhanced growth of ER+ breast cancer cells due to miR-26 depletion. We further demonstrated that estrogen stimulated c-MYC expression was both sufficient and necessary for the diminished expression of miR-26a and miR-26b.
We have identified a novel estrogen/MYC/miR-26 axis that mediates estrogen stimulated cell growth via CHD1, GREB1 and KPNA2.
Nitrate is a serious problem in closed-circuit public aquariums because its accumulation rapidly becomes toxic to many lifeforms. A moving bed biofilm denitrification reactor was installed at the Montreal Biodome to treat its 3,250-m(3) seawater system. Naturally occurring microorganisms from the seawater affluent colonized the reactor carriers to form a denitrifying biofilm. Here, we investigated the functional diversity of this biofilm by retrieving gene sequences related to narG, napA, nirK, nirS, cnorB, and nosZ. A total of 25 sequences related to these genes were retrieved from the biofilm. Among them, the corresponding napA1, nirK1, cnorB9, and nosZ3 sequences were identical to the corresponding genes found in Hyphomicrobium sp. NL23 while the narG1 and narG2 sequences were identical to the two corresponding narG genes found in Methylophaga sp. JAM1. These two bacterial strains were previously isolated from the denitrifying biofilm. To assess the abundance of denitrifiers and nitrate respirers in the biofilm, the gene copy number of all the narG, napA, nirS, and nirK sequences found in biofilm was determined by quantitative PCR. napA1, nirK1, narG1, and narG2, which were all associated with either Methylophaga sp. JAM1 or Hyphomicrobium sp. NL23, were the most abundant genes. The other genes were 10 to 10,000 times less abundant. nirK, cnorB, and nosZ but not napA transcripts from Hyphomicrobium sp. NL23 were detected in the biofilm, and only the narG1 transcripts from Methylophaga sp. JAM1 were detected in the biofilm. Among the 19 other genes, the transcripts of only two genes were detected in the biofilm. Our results show the predominance of Methylophaga sp. JAM1 and Hyphomicrobium sp. NL23 among the denitrifiers detected in the biofilm. The results suggest that Hyphomicrobium sp. NL23 could use the nitrite present in the biofilm generated by nitrate respirers such as Methylophaga sp. JAM1.
Spores have strongly reduced metabolic activity and are produced during the complex developmental cycle of the actinobacterium Streptomyces coelicolor Resting spores can remain viable for decades, yet little is known about how they conserve energy. It is known, however, that they can reduce either oxygen or nitrate using endogenous electron sources. S. coelicolor uses either a cytochrome bd oxidase or a cytochrome bcc-aa3 oxidase supercomplex to reduce oxygen, while nitrate is reduced by Nar-type nitrate reductases, which typically oxidize quinol directly. Here, we show that in resting spores the Nar1 nitrate reductase requires a functional bcc-aa3 supercomplex to reduce nitrate. Mutants lacking the complete qcr-cta genetic locus encoding the bcc-aa3 supercomplex showed no Nar1-dependent nitrate reduction. Recovery of Nar1 activity was achieved by genetic complementation, but only when the complete qcr-cta locus was re-introduced to the mutant strain. We could exclude that the dependence on the supercomplex for nitrate reduction was via regulation of nitrate transport. Moreover, the catalytic subunit, NarG1, of Nar1 was synthesized in the qcr-cta mutant, ruling out transcriptional control. Constitutive synthesis of Nar1 in mycelium revealed that the enzyme was poorly active in this compartment, suggesting that the Nar1 enzyme cannot act as a typical quinol oxidase. Notably, nitrate reduction by the Nar2 enzyme, which is active in growing mycelium, was not wholly dependent on the bcc-aa3 supercomplex for activity. Together, our data suggest that Nar1 functions together with the proton-translocating bcc-aa3 supercomplex to increase the efficiency of energy conservation in resting spores.IMPORTANCEStreptomyces coelicolor forms spores that respire with either oxygen or nitrate, using only endogenous electron donors. This helps maintain a membrane potential and thus viability. Respiratory nitrate reductase (Nar) usually receives electrons directly from reduced quinone species; however, we show that nitrate respiration in spores requires a respiratory supercomplex comprising cytochrome bcc oxidoreductase and aa3 oxidase. Our findings suggest that the Nar1 enzyme in the S. coelicolor spore functions together with the proton-translocating bcc-aa3 supercomplex to help maintain the membrane potential more efficiently. Dissecting the mechanisms underlying this survival strategy is important for our general understanding of bacterial persistence during infection processes, and how bacteria might deal with nutrient limitation in the natural environment.
Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens JAM1 is the only reported Methylophaga species capable of growing under anaerobic conditions with nitrate as electron acceptor. Its genome encodes a truncated denitrification pathway, which includes two nitrate reductases, Nar1 and Nar2; two nitric oxide reductases, Nor1 and Nor2; and one nitrous oxide reductase, Nos; but no nitrite reductase (NirK or NirS). The transcriptome of strain JAM1 cultivated with nitrate and methanol under anaerobic conditions showed the genes for these enzymes were all expressed. We investigated the importance of Nar1 and Nar2 by knocking out narG1, narG2 or both genes. Measurement of the specific growth rate and the specific nitrate reduction rate of the knockout mutants JAM1ΔnarG1 (Nar1) and JAM1ΔnarG2 (Nar2) clearly demonstrated that both Nar systems contributed to the growth of strain JAM1 under anaerobic conditions, but at different levels. The JAM1ΔnarG1 mutant exhibited an important decrease in the nitrate reduction rate that consequently impaired its growth under anaerobic conditions. In JAM1ΔnarG2, the mutation induced a 20-h lag period before nitrate reduction occurred at specific rate similar to that of strain JAM1. The disruption of narG1 did not affect the expression of narG2. However, the expression of the Nar1 system was highly downregulated in the presence of oxygen with the JAM1ΔnarG2 mutant. These results indicated that Nar1 is the major nitrate reductase in strain JAM1 but Nar2 appears to regulate the expression of Nar1. 
Data sets linking comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to clinical outcomes may accelerate precision medicine.
To assess whether a database that combines EHR-derived clinical data with CGP can identify and extend associations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Clinical data from EHRs were linked with CGP results for 28 998 patients from 275 US oncology practices. Among 4064 patients with NSCLC, exploratory associations between tumor genomics and patient characteristics with clinical outcomes were conducted, with data obtained between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2018.
Tumor CGP, including presence of a driver alteration (a pathogenic or likely pathogenic alteration in a gene shown to drive tumor growth); tumor mutation burden (TMB), defined as the number of mutations per megabase; and clinical characteristics gathered from EHRs.
Overall survival (OS), time receiving therapy, maximal therapy response (as documented by the treating physician in the EHR), and clinical benefit rate (fraction of patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response) to therapy.
Among 4064 patients with NSCLC (median age, 66.0 years; 51.9% female), 3183 (78.3%) had a history of smoking, 3153 (77.6%) had nonsquamous cancer, and 871 (21.4%) had an alteration in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 (701 [17.2%] with EGFR, 128 [3.1%] with ALK, and 42 [1.0%] with ROS1 alterations). There were 1946 deaths in 7 years. For patients with a driver alteration, improved OS was observed among those treated with (n = 575) vs not treated with (n = 560) targeted therapies (median, 18.6 months [95% CI, 15.2-21.7] vs 11.4 months [95% CI, 9.7-12.5] from advanced diagnosis; P &lt; .001). TMB (in mutations/Mb) was significantly higher among smokers vs nonsmokers (8.7 [IQR, 4.4-14.8] vs 2.6 [IQR, 1.7-5.2]; P &lt; .001) and significantly lower among patients with vs without an alteration in EGFR (3.5 [IQR, 1.76-6.1] vs 7.8 [IQR, 3.5-13.9]; P &lt; .001), ALK (2.1 [IQR, 0.9-4.0] vs 7.0 [IQR, 3.5-13.0]; P &lt; .001), RET (4.6 [IQR, 1.7-8.7] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .004), or ROS1 (4.0 [IQR, 1.2-9.6] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .03). In patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (n = 1290, 31.7%), TMB of 20 or more was significantly associated with improved OS from therapy initiation (16.8 months [95% CI, 11.6-24.9] vs 8.5 months [95% CI, 7.6-9.7]; P &lt; .001), longer time receiving therapy (7.8 months [95% CI, 5.5-11.1] vs 3.3 months [95% CI, 2.8-3.7]; P &lt; .001), and increased clinical benefit rate (80.7% vs 56.7%; P &lt; .001) vs TMB less than 20.
Among patients with NSCLC included in a longitudinal database of clinical data linked to CGP results from routine care, exploratory analyses replicated previously described associations between clinical and genomic characteristics, between driver mutations and response to targeted therapy, and between TMB and response to immunotherapy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of creating a clinicogenomic database derived from routine clinical experience and provide support for further research and discovery evaluating this approach in oncology.
In the adult mammalian heart, the majority of Ca2+ required for contraction is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the Ca2+-release channel or ryanodine receptor (RyR). Such release is dependent upon a relatively small influx of Ca2+ entering the cell across the sarcolemma (SL) by means of the L-type Ca2+ channel or the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR). In lower vertebrates, there is indirect evidence suggesting that Ca2+ influx across the SL may be sufficient to support contraction in the absence of Ca2+ release from the SR. This apparent difference in myocardial excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling was investigated further by determining DHPR and RyR densities in ventricular homogenate preparations from rat, trout, dogfish and hagfish. DHPR Bmax values (means +/- S.E.M.) were highest in rat (0.30 +/- 0.01 pmol mg-1), lower in trout (0.16 +/- 0.01 pmol mg-1) and dogfish (0.27 +/- 0.03 pmol mg-1), and slightly above the level of detection in hagfish (0.03 +/- 0.01 pmol mg-1). The DHPR dissociation constants (Kd) of 40-70 pmoll-1 in these three species were of similar magnitude. RyR binding revealed both high- and low-affinity sites in all species. RyR Bmax for the high-affinity site was greatest in the rat (0.68 pmol mg-1), lower in trout (0.19 pmol mg-1) and dogfish (0.07 pmol mg-1) and lowest in hagfish (0.01 pmol mg-1). The RyR Kd1 values for the high-affinity sites were comparable in all preparations (range 12-87 nmoll-1). The quantitative expression of RyRs in these species is consistent with the relative amount of SR present as indicated in physiological experiments and electron micrographs. Taking into consideration myocyte morphology of teleost and elasmobranch species, the data are consistent with a greater reliance on Ca2+ influx across the SL during E-C coupling in lower vertebrates, although a functional role for Ca2+ release from the SR in the more active species await further investigation.
The pathology of cholestatic liver injury (CLI) was complicated, which has limited the development of anti-cholestatic drugs for a long period. Metabolomic researches focused on global and dynamic changes of the organism could shed some light on mechanism investigation. In order to characterize and validate metabolite alterations of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) induced CLI in C57BL/6 mice, a systemic metabolomic approach combining nontargeted HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and targeted UFLC-ESI-MS/MS technologies were developed innovatively. Multivariate data analysis was applied to determine the changes of metabolites in processed plasma and liver samples between control and model groups. Afterwards, 38 potential plasma biomarkers and 17 potential liver biomarkers involved in bile acid (BA) biosynthesis, phospholipid biosynthesis, sphingolipid metabolism, alpha linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism, as well as arachidonic acid metabolism were found and attributed as potential biomarkers and influential pathways of cholestasis. Based on correlation analysis, BA biosynthesis played the most important role in ANIT induced CLI, thereinto, major BAs were carried out with quantitative analysis. Targeted metabolomic results showed that the increase of BAs might have an impact on intestinal microbial ecology which could aggravate liver injury probably, among which cholic acid (CA) and taurocholic acid (TCA) were the most sensitive indicators of ANIT induced CLI in both plasma and liver. In conclusion, CLI might correlate significantly with hepatocyte necrosis, metabolic disorders and imbalance of intestinal microbiome ecology triggered by BA accumulation.
Patients suffering from cholestasis often report experiencing a debilitating, unrelenting itch. In contrast to conditions like urticaria in which histamine primarily drives itch (pruritus), cholestatic pruritus is multifactorial and more difficult to treat. Existing therapies are not always effective and exhibit undesirable side effect profiles. Here, we conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate conventional treatment strategy, current pathophysiologic understanding and the role of novel therapies in the context of cholestatic pruritus. We discuss novel findings implicating bile acids, lysophosphatidic acid, and bilirubin as potential important mediators of cholestatic itch. New therapies that aim to remove or modulate pruritogens have been supported in observational cohort studies and randomized controlled trials. While these new therapies show promise, further research is needed to confirm the pathophysiology of cholestatic pruritus, so that targeted therapy can be developed.
Cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (3β,5α,6β-triol) is formed from cholestan-5,6-epoxide (5,6-EC) in a reaction catalysed by cholesterol epoxide hydrolase, following formation of 5,6-EC through free radical oxidation of cholesterol. 7-Oxocholesterol (7-OC) and 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-HC) can also be formed by free radical oxidation of cholesterol. Here we investigate how 3β,5α,6β-triol, 7-OC and 7β-HC are metabolised to bile acids. We show, by monitoring oxysterol metabolites in plasma samples rich in 3β,5α,6β-triol, 7-OC and 7β-HC, that these three oxysterols fall into novel branches of the acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis becoming (25R)26-hydroxylated then carboxylated, 24-hydroxylated and side-chain shortened to give the final products 3β,5α,6β-trihydroxycholanoic, 3β-hydroxy-7-oxochol-5-enoic and 3β,7β-dihydroxychol-5-enoic acids, respectively. The intermediates in these pathways may be causative of some phenotypical features of, and/or have diagnostic value for, the lysosomal storage diseases, Niemann Pick types C and B and lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Free radical derived oxysterols are metabolised in human to unusual bile acids via novel branches of the acidic pathway, intermediates in these pathways are observed in plasma.
The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is gradually rising in sub-Saharan Africa. This may be due to dietary changes associated with urbanization, which may induce tumor-promoting gut microbiota composition and function. We compared fecal microbiota composition and activity in 10 rural and 10 urban Zimbabweans for evidence of a differential CRC risk. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Fecal microbiota composition, metabolomic profile, functional microbial genes were analyzed, and bile acids and short chain fatty acids quantified. Animal protein intake was higher among urban volunteers, but carbohydrate and fiber intake were similar. Bacteria related to Blautia obeum, Streptococcus bovis, and Subdoligranulum variabile were higher in urban residents, whereas bacteria related to Oscillospira guillermondii and Sporobacter termitidis were higher in rural volunteers. Fecal levels of primary bile acids, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (P &lt; 0.05), and secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (P &lt; 0.05) and ursodeoxycholic acid (P &lt; 0.001) were higher in urban residents. Fecal levels of acetate and propionate, but not butyrate, were higher in urban residents. The gut microbiota composition and activity among rural and urban Zimbabweans retain significant homogeneity (possibly due to retention of dietary fiber), but urban residents have subtle changes, which may indicate a higher CRC risk.
Accurate diagnosis and stratification of children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remain challenging. Given the central role of recurrent abdominal pain in IBS, we evaluated the relationships of pediatric IBS and abdominal pain with intestinal microbes and fecal metabolites using a comprehensive clinical characterization and multiomics strategy. Using rigorous clinical phenotyping, we identified preadolescent children (aged 7 to 12 years) with Rome III IBS (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 22) and characterized their fecal microbial communities using whole-genome shotgun metagenomics and global unbiased fecal metabolomic profiling. Correlation-based approaches and machine learning algorithms identified associations between microbes, metabolites, and abdominal pain. IBS cases differed from controls with respect to key bacterial taxa (eg, Flavonifractor plautii and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7_1_58FAA), metagenomic functions (eg, carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism), and higher-order metabolites (eg, secondary bile acids, sterols, and steroid-like compounds). Significant associations between abdominal pain frequency and severity and intestinal microbial features were identified. A random forest classifier built on metagenomic and metabolic markers successfully distinguished IBS cases from controls (area under the curve, 0.93). Leveraging multiple lines of evidence, intestinal microbes, genes/pathways, and metabolites were associated with IBS, and these features were capable of distinguishing children with IBS from healthy children. These multi-omics features, and their links to childhood IBS coupled with nutritional interventions, may lead to new microbiome-guided diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
Dental treatment anxiety usually develops during childhood due to a bad experience and the dental drill as well as the injection needle are the most common causes. The Atraumatic Restorative Treatment provides the opportunity to provoke little or no dental treatment anxiety because only hand instruments are used and local anaesthesia is seldom required. Several scientific studies have indicated that the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment causes less pain, discomfort and anxiety by comparison with conventional treatments. Therefore, the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is considered to be promising for the treatment of carious lesions in anxious children and adults, and potentially also for patients suffering from dental treatment phobia. Furthermore, the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment may be indicated as the primary treatment method in children to prevent dental treatment anxiety and treatment under general anaesthesia. These conclusions must still be confirmed with responsible scientific research.
Pneumonia is a prevalent cause of death in care home residents. Dysphagia is a significant risk factor of aspiration pneumonia. The purpose of the current study was to screen for risk of aspiration in care home residents in the Netherlands and assess potential risk factors of aspiration. Five experienced speech-language therapists assessed 203 care home residents (115 primarily physically disabled, 88 primarily cognitively impaired) 60 and older in the first week after admission to a care home. In 43 (21.2%) residents, speech-language therapists assessed risk of aspiration and found no significant difference between physically disabled (26.1%) and cognitively impaired (14.8%) residents. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the final prediction model for risk of aspiration showed Parkinson's disease as a significant factor (odds ratio = 5.11; 95% confidence interval [1.49, 17.52]) . The authors therefore conclude that risk of aspiration is a relevant care problem among Dutch care home residents and requires further assessment.
This study aimed to investigate the sex-specific prevalence and metabolic risk factors of fatty liver disease (FLD), and to predict the prevalence of steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis in Wuhan, south central China.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 25,032 participants who underwent health checkups from 2010 to 2011 in Zhongnan hospital.
The prevalence of FLD was higher among men than among women (31.8 vs. 12.9%, P&lt;0.0001). However, it increased markedly with age among women, and in the age-groups above 60 years, the prevalence was similar between men and women (26.4 vs. 27.6%, P&gt;0.05). FLD was associated with obesity, increased levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins, serum uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and fasting blood sugar, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio of less than 1, and a decreased level of high-density lipoprotein in both sexes. Multiple regression analyses showed that obesity, elevated levels of fasting blood sugar, TG, total cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio of less than 1, serum uric acid levels, and decreased high-density lipoprotein levels were related to FLD in men, whereas age played a more prominent role in women. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis, estimated using the BMI, age, ALT, and TG index (BAAT index), was 2.5% in men and 1.4% in women; more women with FLD had a BAAT score of 3 or higher compared with men (9.0 vs. 6.6%).
The prevalence of FLD in China is high among men and elderly women and is mainly related to various metabolic parameters. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis is considerably high among individuals with FLD.
The study objective was to collect diagnostic data, to explore correlations between diagnostic variables, to provide an accurate initial diagnosis, and to provide appropriate management in consecutive subjects consulting with a multidisciplinary halitosis team because of a halitosis complaint.
Nine hundred and fifty-four subjects with halitosis complaints applied for consultation. Subjects' history data were collected and organoleptic measurements and a physical examination were performed. Finally, genuine halitosis or pseudo-halitosis/halitophobia was diagnosed initially and management was provided.
Genuine oral halitosis was diagnosed initially in 93% of cases. Using oral cleaning materials, performing mechanical tongue cleaning, and periodical dentist consultation were over-represented in women, whereas men were more likely to have observable biofilm and carious lesions than women. Female gender was associated with tongue coating. Positive associations were found between age and performing mechanical tongue cleaning, organoleptic measurement scores as well as poor oral health. Educational level was positively associated with oral self care behaviours. Performing mechanical tongue cleaning was not associated with periodical dentist consultation.
In nearly all subjects complaining of halitosis, an oral cause could be detected.
The ultimate strength of a dental prosthesis is defined as the strongest loading force applied to the prosthesis until afracture failure occurs. Important key terms are strength, hardness, toughness and fatigue. Relatively prevalent complications of single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses are porcelain and ceramic fractures. Afactor which also plays a role is the functional loading force from the entire orofacial system. With respect to the strength of multi-unit fixed dental prostheses, the length of the arch span between the abutment teeth, the pontic with the connectors and the possible cantilevers are the critical components. Components of the configuration ofabutment teeth of single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses which are relevant for its strength are the convergence angle and the design of(the area above) the (cervical) outline. Finally, the thickness of the porcelain or the ceramic (veneers) ofmetal-ceramic and all-ceramic single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses is of importance.
The objective of a preprosthetic orthodontic treatment is to position the teeth in such a way that a treatment with (fixed) dental prostheses is made possible or simplified or to affect the result of this treatment positively. Conceivable preprosthetic orthodontic treatments are: correcting primary orthodontic anomalies, closing or reducing interdental spaces and correcting the migration of teeth. In the case of unfavourable maxillomandibular relations, a preprosthetic surgical treatment is usually needed together with a preprosthetic orthodontic treatment. For children with agenesis and/or early loss of teeth and/or aberrant morphology of teeth, a treatment with fixed dental prostheses, either implant-supported or not, may be indicated after the tooth development or in some cases earlier. Until that time, preprosthetic orthodontic treatments may be indicated to offer an aesthetically sound provisional solution and to achieve optimal teeth positions for the final fixed dental prostheses.
The degree to which single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses are able to withstand loading forces is dependent, among other things, on the quality of their retention and resistance. The quality of the retention and resistance of the configuration of an abutment tooth prepared for a metal and metal-ceramic single-unit fixed dental prosthesis is determined by the configuration's convergence angle, the height, the volume, the interocclusal space, the cervical outline design, the additional preparations, the quality of the (build-up) restoration, and the surface roughness. A silicate ceramic single-unit fixed dental prosthesis is attached through adhesion using a composite cement, but the retention and resistance of an oxide ceramic single-unit fixed dental prosthesis is dependent on the abutment tooth configuration. Most types of multi-unit fixed dental prosthesis have the following additional retention and resistance determining factors: the position in the occlusal system, the number of abutment teeth and their mutual configurations, and the length of (cantilever) pontics. A resin-bonded fixed partial denture's retention and resistance are determined by its bonding as well as its enamel surface coverage and its resistance preparations.
To derive an estimate of encounters with halitosis and to assess the impact of halitosis on their psychosocial interactions with halitosis patients.
Participants were 1,006 members of an online panel, being representative of the population of the Netherlands with regard to gender, age, family situation, education level and labour participation. They were invited to participate in a survey using an online questionnaire with four questions on becoming faced with people having halitosis.
Almost 90% of the participants indicated being faced with a person having halitosis regularly, 40% at least once a week, and men significantly more frequently than women. Halitosis was reported to be a strong 'downer' when meeting a person for the first time. Whether one would draw a person's attention to his breath malodour proved to be related to the kind of person involved and appeared to decrease with the increase of the social distance to the person. Drawing a person's attention to his breath malodour would virtually always be performed personally.
Halitosis is considered to be one of the most unattractive aspects of social interactions and has potentially damaging effects on psychosocial interactions and relationships.
Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is a minimally invasive treatment modality which is intended to prevent carious lesions and to stop the progression of carious lesions. The treatment modality was developed to preserve carious teeth and was primarily aimed at communities having little or no electricity, piped water and oral healthcare and who have limited financial resources. In 1994, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment was recognised by the World Health Organization. Several systematic studies have demonstrated that Atraumatic Restorative Treatment using high-viscosity glass ionomer cement provides reliable results for one-surface restorations in deciduous molars and permanent (pre)molars. In developed as well as developing countries, more possibilities have been created with this low-cost treatment to improve the oral health of communities who have previously not had access to adequate care.
Prosthetic replacement of missing teeth aims to improve health. This can be achieved by improving the patient's well-being and quality of life and by restoring the biological balance in terms ofocclusal and mandibular stability in the occlusal and the orofacial system. In occlusal systems with a complete anterior region and 'satisfactory' premolar and molar regions, prosthetic replacement of missing teeth is not indicated generally. In case ofa restricted number of missing teeth in the anterior region and/or a not 'satisfactory' premolar region, fixed dental prostheses may be indicated. In case of an incomplete anterior region and no 'satisfactory'premolar as well as molar regions, removable dental prostheses are usually indicated. These guidelines are presented in the absence of sufficient scientific evidence. Therefore, in clinical decision making, the question whether prosthetic replacement of missing teeth is sensible, and if so, by which type of dental prosthesis, can only be answered after a dialogue with mutual respect between care provider and patient.
This article presents a brief introduction to the medical aspects of ageing and age-related diseases, and to some geriatric syndromes, followed by a discussion on their impact on general and oral healthcare provision to community-dwelling older people. Recent investigations suggest that inflammation constitutes a biological foundation of ageing and the onset of age-related diseases. Multimorbidity and polypharmacy, together with alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, make older people at risk of adverse medication reactions. A side effect of several medications is causing xerostomia and hyposalivation, and both the type and number of medications used are relevant. New options of general healthcare provision to community-dwelling older people are the use of mobility aids and assistive technology devices, domiciliary health care, respite care and telecare. Their oral health status may be jeopardised by frailty, disability, care dependency and limited access to professional oral health care. Recommendations for improvement are the following: better integrating oral health care into general health care, developing and implementing an oral healthcare guideline, providing customised oral hygiene care aids, domiciliary oral healthcare provision, visiting dental hygienists and/or nurses, oral hygiene telecare, easily and safely accessible dental offices, transforming dentistry into medical oral health care and upgrading dentists to oral physicians. In case oral healthcare providers do not take the responsibility of persuading society of the importance of adequate oral health, weakened oral health of community-dwelling older people will become a potential new geriatric syndrome. 
A single- or multi-unit fixed dental prosthesis can be attached to the abutment teeth through mechanical retention and gap sealing or by adhesion. For sealing the gap, water-soluble cements are appropriate, such as zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, and (resin-modified) glasionomer cement. Attachment through adhesion can be performed with composite cement. If the hard tooth tissue is prepared adequately, composite cement provides sufficient adhesion, but self-adhesive composite cement is now also available. For the adhesion of the composite cement to the restorative materials of the single- or multi-unit fixed dental prosthesis, surface sandblasting, silanizing, and tin coating and the application of a metal primer or chemically active composite are available. Cementing a single- or multi-unit dental prosthesis involves 3 phases: 1. Cleansing the single- or multi-unit dental prosthesis and the abutment tooth/teeth; 2. Preparing the hard tooth tissue, mixing the cement and placing the single- or multi-unit dental prosthesis; 3. Removing the excess cement.
In a correctly functioning occlusal system, the design of the occlusal parts of single-unit and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses is generally determined by the maximum intercuspation. Determining and recording the maxillomandibular relationships is only required in case the adjacent teeth do not offer adequate support or reference to put the maxillary and mandibular cast in maximum intercuspation or in case the existing occlusion needs a well-structured alteration. The maxillomandibular relationships can be determined and registered analogously and digitally and on that basis the maxillary and mandibular casts can be mounted in a (virtual) occludator or articulator. In the absence of a distinct occlusal plane, one may consider first carrying out a facebow recording and transfer. Usually, the accuracy of determining and recording the maxillomandibular relationships does not increase when using more complicated methods.
Dysphagia has been found to be strongly associated with aspiration pneumonia in frail older people. Aspiration pneumonia is causing high hospitalization rates, morbidity, and often death. Better insight in the prevalence of (subjective) dysphagia in frail older people may improve its early recognition and treatment.
First, to assess the prevalence of subjective dysphagia in care home residents in the Netherlands. Second, to assess the associations of subjective dysphagia with potential risk factors of dysphagia.
Retrospective data-analysis of a cross-sectional, multi-centre point prevalence measurement.
119 care homes in the Netherlands.
Data of 8119 care home residents aged 65 years or older were included and analyzed.
Subjective dysphagia was assessed by a resident's response to a dichotomous question with regard to experiencing swallowing problems. If a resident was not able to respond (e.g. residents with dementia or aphasia), the question was answered by the ward care provider, or the resident's file was consulted for registered swallowing complaints and/or dysphagia. Several residents' data were collected: gender, age, (number of) diseases, the presence of malnutrition, the Care Dependency Scale score, and the body mass index.
Subjective dysphagia was found in 751 (9%) residents. A final model for subjective dysphagia after multivariate backward stepwise regression analysis revealed eight significant variables: age (B -0.022), Care Dependency Scale score (B -0.985), 'malnutrition' (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.31-1.90), 'comorbidity' (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14), and the disease clusters 'dementia' (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.45-0.66), 'nervous system disorder' (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.20-1.99), 'cardiovascular disease' (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67-0.99) and 'cerebrovascular disease/hemiparesis' (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.45-2.10).
It seems justified to conclude that subjective dysphagia is a relevant care problem in older care home residents in the Netherlands. Care Dependency Scale score, 'malnutrition', and the disease clusters 'dementia', 'nervous system disorder', and 'cerebrovascular disease/hemiparesis' were associated with the presence of subjective dysphagia in this study. Age, 'comorbidity' and 'cardiovascular disease' showed very small influence.
Unexpected cholestasis substantially contributes to drug failure in clinical trials. Current models used for safety assessment in drug development do not accurately predict cholestasis in humans. Therefore, it is of relevance to develop new screening models that allow identifying drugs with cholestatic properties.
We employed mouse precision cut liver slices (PCLS), which were incubated 24 h with two model cholestatic compounds: cyclosporin A (CsA) and chlorpromazine (CPZ). Subsequently, transcriptome analysis using DNA microarrays and q-PCR were performed to identify relevant biological processes and biomarkers. Additionally, histology was carried out and levels of triglycerides (TG) and bile acids (BA) were measured. To verify the ex vivo mouse data, these were compared with publically available human data relevant for cholestasis.
Whole genome gene expression analysis showed that CsA up-regulated pathways related to NF-κB, ER stress and inflammation. Both CsA and CPZ down-regulated processes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, BA homeostasis, Fxr signalling, and energy metabolism. The differential expression of a number of characteristic genes (e.g. Abcg5, Abcg8, Klf15, and Baat) could be confirmed by q-PCR. Histology revealed that CsA but not CPZ induced "ballooning" of hepatocytes. No effects on TG and BA levels were observed after incubation of PCLS with CsA and CPZ. A substantial number of processes altered in CsA- and CPZ-treated mouse PCLS ex vivo was also found to be affected in liver biopsies of cholestatic patients.
The present study demonstrated that mouse PCLS can be used as a tool to identify mechanisms of action of cholestatic model compounds. The induction of general stress responses and down-regulated Fxr signalling could play a role in the development of drug induced cholestasis. Importantly, comparative data analysis showed that the ex vivo mouse findings are also relevant for human pathology. Moreover, this work provides a set of genes that are potentially useful to assess drugs for cholestatic properties.
To identify barriers of delivering oral health care to older people experienced by dentists.
A comprehensive literature search was carried out for studies published in the period January 1990-December 2011, using free text and MESH term search strategies for PubMed (Medline), EMBASE and CINAHL.
The initial search identified 236 potentially relevant publications: PubMed (Medline; n = 127), EMBASE (n = 108) and CINAHL (n = 1). After screening of titles and abstracts, 14 publications were revealed as relevant for further review. Seven articles, focusing on dentists delivering oral health care to older people in care homes, were suitable for this review, and seven articles did not meet the previously determined quality criteria. One of these articles also focused on barriers experienced by dentists working in their own practice and delivering oral health care to community-dwelling older people.
The most common barriers of delivering oral health care to older people were identified respectively as: the lack of adequate equipment in a care home and no area for treatment available (n = 4) and the lack of adequate reimbursement for working in a care home (n = 5). In addition, the inadequate training and experience in delivering oral health care to older care home residents (n = 2) were mentioned. Four publications indicated the loss of time from private practice as a barrier to deliver oral health care in a care home. We suggest that additional research should be initiated to investigate more in detail the barriers dentists experience in delivering oral health care to older people in their own dental practices.
An important aim ofa treatment with single-unit and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses is a durable and profitable treatment outcome. That requires aftercare, too. First, the frequency of routine oral examinations should be assessed, using an individual risk profile. The objectives of the routine oral examinations are the prevention and, when necessary, the treatment of pathological conditions and complications. With regard to prevention, attention should be paid to information and instruction, oral biofilm and calculus, non-functional activities, hard tooth tissues, periodontal and peri-implant tissues, and saliva. Subsequently, it can be determined whether the intended durability and profitability have been achieved or can still be achieved, whether or not through indicated adjustments. Special attention should be paid to endodontically treated teeth. Restorative, repair or replacement treatments may be indicated in case ofcomplications, such as loose single- or multi-unitfixed dental prosthesis, fracture of a fixed dental prosthesis unit, lost tooth pulp vitality, tooth root fracture, and implant or implant abutment problems.
To systematically review the literature on the effect of providing oral healthcare education to care home nurses on their oral healthcare knowledge and attitude and their oral hygiene care skills.
A literature search was obtained for relevant articles on oral healthcare education of nurses in care homes, using five electronic retrieval systems and databases. The search was limited to human studies, articles published in English and articles published during the period January 1990 to December 2011. The methodological quality of an article was assessed on the basis of criteria published by the Cochrane Collaboration. For articles not meeting all methodological quality criteria, relevance criteria were used to determine how much scientific evidence could be assigned to the study findings.
In accordance with the methodological quality criteria, two randomized controlled trials were included. Additionally, four studies were included after determining the scientific evidence of the study findings. The studies included revealed some scientific evidence and indications that an oral healthcare education programme for care home nurses may improve the nurses' oral healthcare knowledge and attitude. Any effect of oral healthcare education to care home nurses' oral hygiene care skills could not be determined.
Oral healthcare education may have a positive effect on care home nurses' oral healthcare knowledge and attitude and on care home residents' oral hygiene, whereas any effect on care home nurses' oral hygiene care skills could not be found.
Occlusal surfaces of teeth and restorations wear by repeated antagonistic contact. Two-body wear is the result of direct contact between occlusal surfaces. In cases of three-body wear, food is found between antagonistic teeth. Contact wear is expressed predominantly by abrasion and material fatigue. Erosion is a type of wear which does not involve direct antagonistic contact. Qualitative methods exist for registering occlusal tooth wear. Wear of restorations can be measured using casts. An obvious method for comparing rates of wear of restorative materials is laboratory research. This method has demonstrated that the wear rates of composite and enamel are similar. Cast metals and in particular ceramic wear less than enamel. The relation between oral factors and the rate of tooth wear is not always clear. Wellpolished surfaces of restorations wear less quickly and have less effect on the wearing of antagonistic teeth than rougher restoration surfaces.
As a result of the introduction of oral implants, it is also possible to treat patients who have a reduced occlusal system with implant-supported fixed dental prostheses. Many publications report the successful application of implant-supported single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses. However, it is questionable if implants are also successful in periodontally compromised patients. With respect to implant treatment, roughly 3 categories of periodontally compromised patients can be distinguished: patients who have not been treated for periodontitis, patients who have been treated for periodontitis and have stable periodontal health, and those who have been treated but have not achieved stable periodontal health. For the first group, periodontal treatment is required. Inserting implants is only indicated in cases showing steady improvement of post-operative periodontal health. The second category has no contraindication for inserting implants. For the third group, inserting implants is contraindicated absolutely. When treatment with oral implants is indicated, meticulous aftercare and a surgical treatment which enables adequate oral hygiene self-care are strict requirements.
The preprosthetic treatment is a phase of the so-called patient-centred oral healthcare cycle. The goal of the preprosthetic treatment is the elimination of pathological conditions and of uncertainties and risks to the greatest extent possible. Teeth in a reduced occlusal system can be distinguished functionally as strategic, non-strategic, and undesirable. The most important objective of the preprosthetic treatment is to establish a positive prognosis for the strategic teeth. Specific aspects relevant to the preprosthetic treatment are: referral to a specialist, requesting a second opinion, inserting 1 or more oral implants, transitional treatments, and occlusal adjustments. Subsequently, the preprosthetic treatment is evaluated to assess whether healthy circumstances have been established for the intended treatment with single- or multi-unit fixed dental prostheses.
This qualitative study explored barriers and enabling factors to the implementation of an oral hygiene protocol in nursing homes.
Oral health care in nursing homes in Flanders (Belgium) is inadequate.
Qualitative data were obtained from nurses employed in 13 nursing homes involved in two randomised controlled trials in Flanders-Belgium. Data were collected by focus group and face-to-face interviews during April 2005 and December 2009. All transcripts were analysed with support of NVivo 8 (Version 2008). Transcripts were intuitively analysed in a two-step method.
Most revealed barriers were consistent with previous findings in the literature. Newly reported barriers were respect for residents' self-determination, experience based oral health care by nurses, residents' oral health status and nurses' inability to notice residents' oral health status. Demand-driven oral health care was found to be a strong enabling factor.
The integration of oral health care into day-to-day care seems to be a major problem due to a multitude of barriers. In future implementation innovations in oral health care an a priori assessment of influencing factors is recommended.
The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic risk factors for fatty liver disease in the elderly, and determine the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the elderly in Wuhan, central China.
The study was a case-control study based on all 4226 adults above 60 years of age from a cohort investigated in 2010-11 at the medical examination center of Zhongnan hospital, using 3145 randomly selected adults under 60 years of age from the same cohort as controls. Fatty liver disease (FLD) was identified with ultrasound imaging. The risk factors measured were body mass index (BMI), and plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum uric acid (SUA). The probability of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis was predicted using a score based on BMI, age, ALT, and TG (BAAT),and using AST/ALT ratio (AAR).
FLD was higher in the elderly (26.7%) than in the non-elderly (22.8%) and similar in the elderly between men and women (26.6% vs 27.0%, p&gt;0.05). BMI, TC, TG, LDL, SUA, AST and ALT were all significantly higher in FLD, whereas the level of HDL was markedly lower. Multiple regression analyses showed that obesity, high TC, TG, SUA, low HDL, and elevated ALT, AAR&lt;1 were closely related to the elderly FLD, while male sex, obesity, high TC, TG, low HDL, elevated ALT, AST and AAR&lt;1 were closely related to the non-elderly FLD. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis estimated as BAAT index≥3 was 2.4% in all subjects, and was higher in the elderly FLD patients than in the non-elderly FLD patients.
The prevalence of FLD is higher in the elderly, and is broadly related to the same metabolic risk factors as in the non-elderly. However, female-sex is no longer protective with increasing age, and the prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis is estimated to be considerably higher in the elderly FLD patients than in the non-elderly FLD controls.
This study examined the influence of self-perceived oral odour on social interaction. A representative sample of 1,082 people from the Dutch population of 16 years and older, were surveyed. On average, the participants graded their oral odour as 66.8 on a scale 0-100; 4.2% judged their oral odour as 'not fresh' (score &lt; or = 30). Approximately 65% indicated that they took into account the fact that, when meeting somebody for the first time, that person might smell their oral odour. Participants judging their oral odour to be not fresh were shown to keep significantly more distance when meeting somebody than participants judging their oral odour as fresh. Noteworthy was a subgroup of participants who judged their oral odour as fresh, but indicated that they always kept a certain distance to other people. The results suggest that self-perceived oral odour is a potential barrier in social interaction.
An occlusal system that does not function well, has a negative impact on the functional level of the oral system and the orofacial system. In purely mechanical terms, a limited anatomical reduction of the occlusal system has limited implications for the functional level since the occlusal system has several forms of adaptation, reserve, and compensation. However, following the loss of (parts of) teeth, an occlusal system may be anatomically reduced to such an extent that restoration of the functional level is required, for instance by the use of implant-supported single- and multiple-unit fixed dental prostheses. The mechanical strength of a tooth and a single-tooth fixed dental prosthesis on a similar tooth type is not essentially different. But the same cannot be said of the mechanical strength of a multiple-unit fixed dental prosthesis, because the strength is controlled by the mechanoreceptors in the periodontal ligaments of the abutment teeth. This control system is disturbed by the insufficiency of or, when oral implants are involved, the absence of mechano-receptors. It is unknown whether this is causing noticeable problems.
Bile acids (BAs) have many physiological roles and exhibit both toxic and protective influences within the liver. Alterations in the BA profile may be the result of disease induced liver injury. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent form of chronic liver disease characterized by the pathophysiological progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The hypothesis of this study is that the 'classical' (neutral) and 'alternative' (acidic) BA synthesis pathways are altered together with hepatic BA composition during progression of human NAFLD. This study employed the use of transcriptomic and metabolomic assays to study the hepatic toxicologic BA profile in progressive human NAFLD. Individual human liver samples diagnosed as normal, steatosis, and NASH were utilized in the assays. The transcriptomic analysis of 70 BA genes revealed an enrichment of downregulated BA metabolism and transcription factor/receptor genes in livers diagnosed as NASH. Increased mRNA expression of BAAT and CYP7B1 was observed in contrast to decreased CYP8B1 expression in NASH samples. The BA metabolomic profile of NASH livers exhibited an increase in taurine together with elevated levels of conjugated BA species, taurocholic acid (TCA) and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). Conversely, cholic acid (CA) and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) were decreased in NASH liver. These findings reveal a potential shift toward the alternative pathway of BA synthesis during NASH, mediated by increased mRNA and protein expression of CYP7B1. Overall, the transcriptomic changes of BA synthesis pathway enzymes together with altered hepatic BA composition signify an attempt by the liver to reduce hepatotoxicity during disease progression to NASH.
Phase II conjugating enzymes play key roles in the metabolism of xenobiotics. In the present study, RNA sequencing was used to elucidate hepatic ontogeny and tissue distribution of mRNA expression of all major known Phase II enzymes, including enzymes involved in glucuronidation, sulfation, glutathione conjugation, acetylation, methylation, and amino acid conjugation, as well as enzymes for the synthesis of Phase II cosubstrates, in male C57BL/6J mice. Livers from male C57BL/6J mice were collected at 12 ages from prenatal to adulthood. Many of these Phase II enzymes were expressed at much higher levels in adult livers than in perinatal livers, such as Ugt1a6b, -2a3, -2b1, -2b5, -2b36, -3a1, and -3a2; Gsta1, -m1, -p1, -p2, and -z1; mGst1; Nat8; Comt; Nnmt; Baat; Ugdh; and Gclc. In contrast, hepatic mRNA expression of a few Phase II enzymes decreased during postnatal liver development, such as mGst2, mGst3, Gclm, and Mat2a. Hepatic expression of certain Phase II enzymes peaked during the adolescent stage, such as Ugt1a1, Sult1a1, Sult1c2, Sult1d1, Sult2as, Sult5a1, Tpmt, Glyat, Ugp2, and Mat1a. In adult mice, the total transcripts for Phase II enzymes were comparable in liver, kidney, and small intestine; however, individual Phase II enzymes displayed marked tissue specificity among the three organs. In conclusion, this study unveils for the first time developmental changes in mRNA abundance of all major known Phase II enzymes in mouse liver, as well as their tissue-specific expression in key drug-metabolizing organs. The age- and tissue-specific expression of Phase II enzymes indicate that the detoxification of xenobiotics is highly regulated by age and cell type.
In congenital scoliosis, an anatomical spine deformity arose during embryonic vertebral development which caused a deformity. Approximately 38-55% of these deformities appear as a syndrome. Prognosis and preferred treatment depend on the type offailure and the severity of the deformity, but surgical correction is often necessary. Neuromuscular scoliosis generally arises at a young age, is often rapidly progressive, and the magnitude of the curve can also progress even in adulthood. The prognosis of the curve together with the symptoms and prognosis of the associated neuromuscular condition determine the preferred treatment. The goal of surgical treatment is to improve the patient's quality of life. Two types of adult scoliosis occur: adult idiopathic scoliosis and adult degenerative scoliosis. The surgical principles for adult idiopathic scoliosis are almost identical to those for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. In degenerative scoliosis, there is almost always a shorter fusion length. In the case of neurologic impairments, decompression of the spinal cord or nerve roots should be carried out.
In high altitude Andean streams an intense solar radiation and coinciding metal pollution allow the persistence of only a few specialized taxa, including chironomids. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine the mechanisms underlying the persistence of chironomids under these multiple stress conditions, hypothesizing that melanin counteracts both the adverse effects of solar radiation and of metals. Melanin was determined in chironomids from reference and metal polluted streams at 3000 and 4000 m altitude, being 2-fold higher at 4000 m compared to 3000 m, and 2-fold higher in polluted streams than in reference streams at both altitudes. The field observations were experimentally verified by assessing the combined effects of Cu and UV-B on the survival and melanin concentration in larvae of the model species Chironomus riparius (Chironomidae, Diptera). In laboratory exposures, the highest melanin concentrations were found in larvae surviving toxic Cu concentrations, but not in those exposed to the highest UV-B radiation. Pre-exposure to UV-B decreased the sensitivity of the larvae to UV-B and to Cu+UV-B. It is concluded that in the field, melanin may protect chironomids partially against both elevated metal concentrations and solar radiation, allowing them to persist under the harshest conditions in high altitude streams.
Blunt abdominal aortic trauma (BAAT) is a very rare occurrence in children, with significant morbidity and mortality. Varied clinical presentations and sparse literature evidence make it difficult to define the proper management policy for paediatric patients.
We report our centre's data on three consecutive children with BAAT managed between 2006 and 2010. A Medline search was also performed for relevant publications since 1966, together with a review of references in retrieved publications.
Forty children (range 1-16 years) were included in our final analysis. Motor vehicle crashes (MVC) were the leading cause of injury (65%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 7.5% (3/40). Nine patients (22.5%) ended up with residual sequelae. Main primary aortic lesions were complete wall rupture (12.5%), intimal transection (70%) and pseudoaneurysm (15%). Twenty-eight children underwent aortic surgical repair (70%). Among the 12 non-operatively managed patients, 41.6% had complications, including one death.
Symptomatic lesions and complete ruptures should undergo immediate surgical repair. Circumferential intimal transections are at high risk of complication and should also receive intervention. Partial intimal transections and delayed pseudoaneurysms can be initially observed by clinical examination and imaging. Patients with these latter pathologies should be operated on at any sign of deterioration.
A scoliosis is a flexible or rigid deformity of the spine in the frontal plane. There are several types of scoliosis, each with specific characteristics. The most prevalent types are idiopathic, congenital, and neuromuscular scoliosis and scoliosis in adults. The aetiology is varied and largely undetermined. Essential components of diagnostics are patient history, physical examination, and radiographs. Treatment options are a conservative approach involving observation and follow-up, a conservative approach involving non-surgical treatment, and surgical treatment. Usually, idiopathic scoliosis causes no or only few complaints at a young age. Up to 35% of patients have a certain degree of back pain. The choice of a certain treatment is determined by the likelihood of progression of the spine deformity. The objective of brace treatment is preventing progression of the deformity. Important objectives of surgical treatment are preventing progression of the deformity and correcting the deformity with correction or preservation of physical equilibrium.
Using a representative sample from the Dutch population, some psychosocial aspects of halitosis were examined. The results of the survey showed that almost 90% of the Dutch population aged 16 years and older were regularly faced with halitosis. Forty percent reported to be exposed to someone with halitosis at least once a week, men significantly more frequently than women. Although less strongly than body odour, halitosis was reported as being one of the most severe 'let-downs' in social interactions. The greater the social distance between subjects, the less likely is the chance that a person's attention will be drawn to halitosis experienced. When it comes to an unknown person, the chance was no more than 7%, suggesting that it is problematic to draw a person's attention to the presence of halitosis. Considering the potential social consequences of halitosis is it important that dentists and dental hygienists draw patients' attention to the presence of halitosis, when this is the case, thereby encouraging them to seek adequate treatment.
During pregnancy, proper hepatobiliary transport and bile acid synthesis protect the liver from cholestatic injury and regulate the maternal and fetal exposure to bile acids, drugs, and environmental chemicals. The objective of this study was to determine the temporal messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein profiles of uptake and efflux transporters as well as bile acid synthetic and conjugating enzymes in livers from virgin and pregnant mice on gestational days (GD) 7, 11, 14, and 17 and postnatal days (PND) 1, 15, and 30. Compared with virgins, the mRNAs of most transporters were reduced approximately 50% in pregnant dams between GD11 and 17. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the downregulation of Mrp3, 6, Bsep, and Ntcp proteins. One day after parturition, the mRNAs of many uptake and efflux hepatobiliary transporters remained low in pregnant mice. By PND30, the mRNAs of all transporters returned to virgin levels. mRNAs of the bile acid synthetic enzymes in the classic pathway, Cyp7a1 and 8b1, increased in pregnant mice, whereas mRNA and protein expression of enzymes in the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis (Cyp27a1 and 39a1) and conjugating enzymes (Bal and Baat) decreased. Profiles of transporter and bile acid metabolism genes likely result from coordinated downregulation of transcription factor mRNA (CAR, LXR, PXR, PPARα, FXR) in pregnant mice on GD14 and 17. In conclusion, pregnancy caused a global downregulation of most hepatic transporters, which began as early as GD7 for some genes and was maximal by GD14 and 17, and was inversely related to increasing concentrations of circulating 17β-estradiol and progesterone as pregnancy progressed.
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a supervised implementation of the "Oral health care Guideline for Older people in Long-term care Institutions" (OGOLI) in The Netherlands.
A sample of 12 care homes in the Netherlands was allocated randomly to an intervention or control group. While the residents in the control group received oral health care as before, the intervention consisted of a supervised implementation of the OGOLI.
At baseline, the overall random sample comprised 342 residents, 52 % in the intervention group and 48 % in the control group. At 6 months, significant differences were observed between the intervention and the control group for mean dental as well as denture plaque, with a beneficial effect for the intervention group. The multilevel mixed-model analyses conducted with the plaque scores at 6 months as outcome variables showed that the reduction by the intervention was only significant for denture plaque.
Supervised implementation of the OGOLI was more effective than non-supervised implementation in terms of reducing mean plaque scores at 6 months. However, the multilevel mixed-model analysis could not exclusively explain the reduction of mean dental plaque scores by the intervention.
A supervised implementation of an oral health care guideline improves oral health of care home residents.
The academic dental education in The Netherlands has been extended to 6 years, among other reasons in order to make it possible for responsibility for oral healthcare to be borne in a wide medical context. It is the job of the 3 national dental schools to make this happen. The new dentist should know and recognize all (peri-)oral disorders and oral symptoms of systemic diseases, and he should be able to deliver oral healthcare to medically compromised patients. Accepting this responsibility is required for dentistry to be transformed into medical oral healthcare and for dentists to be upgraded to oral physicians.
To systematically review the literature on oral health care interventions in frail older people and the effect on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Oral health care seems to play an important role in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia in frail older people.
Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for eligible intervention studies. Only publications with regard to hospitalized or institutionalized older people, who were not dependent on mechanical ventilation were eligible. Two authors independently assessed the publications for their methodological quality.
Five publications were included and reviewed. Two studies showed that improvement of oral health care diminished the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia and the risk of dying from aspiration pneumonia directly. The three studies remaining showed that adequate oral health care decreased the amount of potential respiratory pathogens and suggested a reduction in the risk of aspiration pneumonia by improving the swallowing reflex and cough reflex sensitivity.
According to the results of the current systematic literature review oral health care, consisting of tooth brushing after each meal, cleaning dentures once a day, and professional oral health care once a week, seems the best intervention to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a human rights violation that is pervasive worldwide, and is particularly critical for women during the reproductive period. IPV includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Nurses on in-patient postpartum units are well-positioned to screen women for IPV, yet low screening rates suggest that barriers to screening exist. The purpose of this study was to (a) identify the frequency of screening for IPV, (b) the most important barriers to screening, (c) the relationship between the barriers to screening and the frequency of screening for types of abuse, and (d) to identify other factors that contribute to the frequency of screening for IPV.
In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 96 nurses from postpartum inpatient units in three Canadian urban hospitals. The survey included the Barriers to Abuse Assessment Tool (BAAT), adapted for postpartum nurses (PPN). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to predict barriers to screening for each type of IPV.
The frequency of screening varied by the type of abuse with highest screening rates found for physical and emotional abuse. According to the BAAT-PPN, lack of knowledge was the most important barrier to screening. The BAAT-PPN total score was negatively correlated with screening for physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Using OLS regression models and after controlling for demographic characteristics, the BAAT-PPN explained 14%, 12%, and 11% of the variance in screening for physical, sexual and emotional abuse, respectively. Fluency in the language of the patient was negatively correlated with screening for each type of abuse. When added as Step 3 to OLS regression models, language fluency was associated with an additional decrease in the likelihood of screening for physical (beta coefficient = -.38, P &lt; .001), sexual (beta coefficient = -.24, P = .05), and emotional abuse (beta coefficient = -.48, P &lt; .001) and increased the variance explained by the model to 25%, 17%, and 31%, respectively.
Our findings support an inverse relationship between rates of screening for IPV and nurses' perceptions of barriers. Barriers to screening for IPV, particularly related to knowledge and language fluency, need to be addressed to increase rates of screening on postpartum units.
The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing. This study aimed to assess the recent prevalence of NAFLD and to predict the prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis using established scoring systems in the general population.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 8352 subjects who received health checkups from 2009 to 2010 in three health centers in Japan. Subjects with an intake over 20 g of alcohol/day or with other chronic liver diseases were excluded. Fatty liver was detected by ultrasonography. The probability of NASH with advanced fibrosis was calculated according to the body mass index, age, ALT, and triglyceride (BAAT) and FIB-4 (based on age, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, and platelet counts) indices.
A total of 5075 subjects were enrolled. The overall prevalence of NAFLD was 29.7%. There was a significant threefold difference in the mean prevalence between males (41.0%) and females (17.7%). This prevalence showed a linear increase with body mass index, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol regardless of threshold values, even without obesity. The estimated prevalence of NASH according to the BAAT index ≥3 was 2.7%, and according to the FIB-4 index it was 1.9%.
The prevalence of NAFLD has increased in the general population, especially in males. There is a linear relationship between the prevalence of NAFLD and various metabolic parameters, even in nonobese subjects. The prevalence of NASH with advanced fibrosis is estimated to be considerably high in subjects with NAFLD.
Fabricating removable complete dentures is a rather complicated treatment. The quality of the care delivered is broadly determined by 2 factors: the technical result and the way in which the individual patient experiences and evaluates the treatment. Healthcare professionals who carry out this treatment are subject, with respect to their capability, to the Dutch Individual Healthcare Professions Act. In cases of persisting complaints or problems, edentulous individuals are often treated with an overdenture on oral implants. Several oral healthcare providers are then involved in the treatment. In order to clarify procedures, a trajectory of care is presented in which all of these oral healthcare providers are located. It is expected that the number of edentulous individuals will decline and that the degree of treatment complexity will increase. To guarantee future efficiency and quality of care delivery, a number of regionally distributed national centres of expertise should be established.
On the advice of the National Health Care Institute in the Netherlands and the institute's Board of Scientific Advisors, the minister of Health, Welfare and Sport decides whether a certain drug will or will not be included in the list of drugs covered by the basic health insurance plan mandated for all Dutch citizens. In making this decision emphasis is placed on the therapeutic value of that particular drug compared to that of the standard drug for that disorder, the impact that the inclusion of the drug would have on the budget and the drug's cost-effectiveness. In the case of disorders that do not respond or respond insufficiently to the standard treatment, however, one comes up against the limitations of this system and in some cases a necessary treatment is not reimbursed. With respect to prescribing medications, dentists are qualified to prescribe, provided they are enrolled in the so-called BIG register [that recognises the qualifications of healthcare professionals in the Netherlands]. Dental hygienists, by contrast, are not qualified to prescribe and have to limit themselves to at most recommending over-the-counter medicines. In prescribing medicines, dentists are of course limited to those about which they have comprehensive knowledge and sufficient experience. If a dentist wants to prescibe a drug that is outside his or her own experience, then he or she should consult with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, general practitioner or medical specialist to determine whether the medication can be prescribed and if so, by whom.
Geadviseerd door het Zorginstituut Nederland en de Wetenschappelijke Adviesraad van dit instituut beslist de minister van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport of een medicament wel of niet wordt opgenomen in het basispakket van de verplichte zorgverzekering. Bij deze beoordeling ligt de nadruk op de therapeutische waarde ten opzicht van de in Nederland geldende standaardbehandeling, de budgetimpact en de kosteneffectiviteit. Bij aandoeningen die niet of onvoldoende reageren op een standaardbehandeling loopt men echter tegen de grenzen van dit systeem aan en wordt een noodzakelijke behandeling in voorkomende gevallen niet vergoed. Met betrekking tot het voorschrijven van medicatie hebben tandartsen receptuurbevoegdheid zolang zij in het BIG-register staan ingeschreven; daarentegen hebben mondhygiënisten geen receptuurbevoegdheid en moeten zich beperken tot het hooguit adviseren van vrij verkrijgbare medicamenten. Bij het voorschrijven moeten tandartsen zich uiteraard beperken tot die medicamenten waarvan zij de werking overzien en waarmee zij voldoende ervaring hebben opgebouwd. Mocht een tandarts vinden dat het medicament dat hij wil voorschrijven zijn kennis te boven gaat, dan kan het beste met een mond-, kaak- en aangezichtschirurg, huisarts of medisch specialist worden overlegd of dit medicament kan worden voorgeschreven en zo ja, door wie.
One-third of community-dwelling people older than 65 years of age fall each year, and half of them fall at least twice a year. Older care home residents are approximately three times more likely to fall when compared to community-dwelling older people. Risk indicators for falls are related to the older people's body, environment, behavior, and activities. An important health risk indicator is (orthostatic or postprandial) hypotension, which may induce cerebral hypoperfusion. Although the majority of falls remain without major consequences, 10% to 25% of falls in care homes result in bodily trauma. Prevalent fall-related injuries are brain injury, lower extremity fracture including hip fracture and forearm/wrist fracture, facial fracture, humeral fracture, and rib/scapular fracture. As fall accidents by older people can have severe consequences, prevention of falls is of paramount importance. Healthcare providers, including oral healthcare providers, should inform older people on risks of falling and draw attention to potentially hazardous arrangements.
Many patients who visit a dentist, oral hygienist or other oral healthcare provider use medicines. As a result of the ageing of the Dutch population, the number of patients using medicines will further increase, including the number of patients who are using more than one medicine. In addition to medicines, many patients, including healthy individuals, use self-care medications. Both medicines and self-care medications can interfere with dental treatment and/or may serve as an explanation for changes that dentists, oral hygienists or other oral healthcare providers observe in and around the mouth. With a series of articles about medicines and oral healthcare, attention will be given to this issue, an issue that will be increasingly important in the future. In addition, suggestions will be made in these articles for medicines for disorders in the head and neck region, keeping in mind that these suggestions should not be seen as dogmatic.
Veel patiënten die tandartsen, mondhygiënisten of andere mondzorgverleners bezoeken, gebruiken medicamenten. Door de vergrijzing van de Nederlandse bevolking zal dit aantal verder toenemen, inclusief het aantal patiënten dat meerdere medicamenten gebruikt. Naast medicamenten gebruiken veel patiënten, maar ook gezonde personen, zelfzorgmiddelen. Zowel de gebruikte medicamenten als zelfzorgmiddelen kunnen consequenties hebben voor een tandheelkundige behandeling en/of kunnen een verklaring zijn voor veranderingen die tandartsen, mondhygiënisten en overige mondzorgverleners in en rond de mond waarnemen. Met een serie artikelen over medicatie en mondzorg wordt aandacht geschonken aan deze problematiek, een problematiek waarvan het belang met de tijd alleen maar zal toenemen. Daarnaast zullen in deze artikelen suggesties worden gedaan voor medicamenten voor aandoeningen in het hoofd-halsgebied, waarbij de keuze voor een bepaald medicament niet als dogmatisch moet worden gezien.
The farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) controls bile acid homeostasis by coordinately regulating the expression of synthesizing enzymes (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1), conjugating enzymes (Bal, Baat) and transporters in the ileum (Asbt, Ostα/β) and liver (Ntcp, Bsep, Ostβ). Transcriptional regulation by Fxr can be direct, or through the ileal Fgf15/FGF19 and hepatic Shp pathways. Circulating bile acids are increased during pregnancy due to hormone-mediated disruption of Fxr signaling. While this adaptation enhances lipid absorption, elevated bile acids may predispose women to develop maternal cholestasis. The objective of this study was to determine whether short-term treatment of pregnant mice with GW4064 (a potent FXR agonist) restores Fxr signaling to the level observed in virgin mice. Plasma, liver and ilea were collected from virgin and pregnant mice administered vehicle or GW4064 by oral gavage. Treatment of pregnant mice with GW4064 induced ileal Fgf15, Shp and Ostα/β mRNAs, and restored hepatic Shp, Bal, Ntcp, and Bsep back to vehicle-treated virgin levels. Pregnant mice exhibited 2.5-fold increase in Cyp7a1 mRNA compared to virgin controls, which was reduced by GW4064. Similarly treatment of mouse primary hepatocytes with plasma isolated from pregnant mice induced Cyp7a1 mRNA by nearly 3-fold as compared to virgin plasma, which could be attenuated by co-treatment with either GW4064 or recombinant FGF19 protein. Collectively, these data reveal that repressed activity of intestinal and hepatic Fxr in pregnancy, as previously demonstrated, may be restored by pharmacological activation. This study provides the basis for a novel approach to restore bile acid homeostasis in patients with maternal cholestasis.
There is an urgent need for reliable and universally applicable outcome measures for children with mitochondrial diseases. In this study, we aimed to adapt the currently available Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) to the International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (IPMDS) during a Delphi-based process with input from international collaborators, patients and caretakers, as well as a pilot reliability study in eight patients. Subsequently, we aimed to test the feasibility, construct validity and reliability of the IPMDS in a multicentre study.
A clinically, biochemically and genetically heterogeneous group of 17 patients (age 1.6-16 years) from five different expert centres from four different continents were evaluated in this study.
The feasibility of the IPMDS was good, as indicated by a low number of missing items (4 %) and the positive evaluation of patients, parents and users. Principal component analysis of our small sample identified three factors, which explained 57.9 % of the variance. Good construct validity was found using hypothesis testing. The overall interrater reliability was good [median intraclass correlation coefficient for agreement between raters (ICCagreement) 0.85; range 0.23-0.99).
In conclusion, we suggest using the IPMDS for assessing natural history in children with mitochondrial diseases. These data should be used to further explore construct validity of the IPMDS and to set age limits. In parallel, responsiveness and the minimal clinically important difference should be studied to facilitate sample size calculations in future clinical trials.
To prevent the development of adiposity-associated metabolic diseases, early biomarkers are needed. Such markers could bring insight to understand the complexity of susceptibility to obesity. Urine and plasma metabolomics fingerprints have been successfully associated with metabolic dysfunctions. Fat resistance (FR) was found to be associated with higher urinary levels of acylglycines and leucine. However, no differences were observed before the diet switch. In this context, we aimed at characterizing metabolic signatures predictive of resistance or sensitivity to fat in the C57Bl6/J mouse model. Urinary metabolic profiles of FR (n=15) and fat sensitivity (FS) mice (n=14) were performed on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Urinary and plasma metabolic profiles were first collected at baseline (during low-fat diet), then after 10weeks of high-fat (HF) feeding. Mice were sorted a posteriori into FS and FR based on their final adiposity. After HF feeding for 10weeks, FS mice tended to have lower plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate than FR ones. Urinary metabolic profiles showed that baseline levels of octanoylglycine, leucine and valine were significantly lower in FS mice. Moreover, expressions in the adipose tissue of Baat and Glyat mRNA were lower in FS than in FR mice. In muscle, mRNA encoding CaD and UbE2b tended to be lower in FS mice than in FR mice (P=.056 and P=.071, respectively). The data show that lower levels of urinary octanoylglycine, leucine and valine are potential predictive biomarkers of FS and could be related to a lower stimulation in adipose acyl-coenzyme A conjugation to glycine and to muscle protein breakdown.
Depression is a complex disease characterized by a series of pathological changes. Research on depression is mainly focused on the changes in brain, but not on liver. Therefore, we initially explored the metabolic profiles of hepatic extracts from rats treated with chronic unpredictive mild stress (CUMS) by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Using multivariate statistical analysis, a total of 26 altered metabolites distinguishing CUMS-induced depression from normal control were identified. Using two-stage receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, 18 metabolites were recognized as potential biomarkers related to CUMS-induced depression via 12 metabolic pathways. Subsequently, we detected the mRNA expressions levels of apoptosis-associated genes such as Bax and Bcl-2 and four key enzymes including Pla2g15, Pnpla6, Baat and Gad1 involved in phospholipid and primary bile acid biosynthesis in liver tissues of CUMS rats by real-time qRT-PCR assay. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Pla2g15, Pnpla6 and Gad1 mRNA were 1.43,1.68, 1.74, 1.67 and 1.42-fold higher, and those of Baat, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio mRNA were 0.83, 0.85-fold lower in CUMS rats compared with normal control. Results of liver-targeted metabonomics and mRNA expression demonstrated that CUMS-induced depression leads to variations in hepatic metabolic profile and gene expression, and ultimately results in liver injury. 
Fibromyalgia is a syndrome without apparent aetiology, characterised by pain, fatigue, memory disorders, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances. The syndrome is considered to be one of the rheumatic diseases. In the general population, the prevalence varies from 2 to 8%, with a women-men ratio of about 2:1. Suspicion of fibromyalgia arises when a patient has pain at multiple locations that cannot be attributed to trauma or inflammation, and when the pain is especially musculoskeletal. Primary management includes explaining the syndrome and offering reassurance. In addition, one can also attempt to increase mobility, avoid overloading, and improve physical condition and the level of activity, and to activate problem-solving skills. Subsequently, behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy may be considered. The most important manifestations of fibromyalgia in the orofacial and occlusal system seem to be temporomandibular dysfunction, headache, xerostomia, hyposalivation, burning mouth and dysgeusia. However, with respect to the precise relation of fibromyalgia with the orofacial system, much needs to be elucidated. 
Fibromyalgie is een syndroom zonder aanwijsbare etiologie dat wordt gekenmerkt door pijn, vermoeidheid, geheugenproblemen, stemmingsproblemen en slaapstoornissen. Het syndroom wordt gerekend tot de reumatische aandoeningen. De prevalentie in de algemene bevolking varieert van 2 tot 8%, met een vrouw-manratio van ongeveer 2:1. Verdenking op fibromyalgie ontstaat als een patiënt meerdere pijnlocaties heeft die niet kunnen worden verklaard door een trauma of een ontsteking en als het vooral musculoskelettale pijn betreft. Uitleg en geruststelling zijn de primaire benaderingswijzen. Aanvullend kan men streven naar meer mobiliteit, vermijden van overbelasting, verbetering van lichamelijke conditie en activiteitenniveau en stimulering van probleemoplossend vermogen. Vervolgens kan gedragsbeïnvloeding en medicatie worden overwogen. De belangrijkste manifestaties in het orofaciale systeem en het occlusiesysteem lijken temporomandibulaire disfunctie, hoofdpijn, xerostomie, hyposialie, mondbranden en dysgeusie. Over de exacte relaties tussen fibromyalgie en het orofaciale systeem en het occlusiesysteem valt echter nog veel te leren.
Complications after surgical stabilization for the treatment of unstable spinal metastases are common. Less invasive surgical (LIS) procedures are potentially associated with a lower risk of complications; however, little is known regarding the complications after LIS procedures for the treatment of spinal metastases. Our primary objective was to determine the characteristics and rate of complications after percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) for the treatment of mechanically unstable spinal metastases. The secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of complications and survival.
A retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients who underwent PPSF between 2009 and 2014 for the treatment of unstable spinal metastases was performed. Patient data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, treatment, neurologic function, complications, and survival were collected.
A total of 101 patients were identified, 45 men (45 %) and 56 women (55 %) with a mean age of 60.3 ± 11.2 years. The median operating time was 122 (range 57-325) minutes with a median blood loss of 100 ml (based on 41 subjects). Eighty-eight patients (87 %) ambulated within the first 3 days after surgery. An overall median survival of 11.0 (range 0-70) months was observed, with 79 % of the patients alive at 3 months after treatment. Eighteen patients experienced a total of 30 complications; nonsurgical complications were the most commonly encountered. Prolonged operating time was independently associated with an increased risk of complications.
A complication rate of 18 % was found after PPSF for unstable spinal metastases. Potential advantages of less invasive treatment are limited blood loss and high early ambulation rate.
To determine the impact of self-perceived halitosis on social interactions, and the effect of using an oral rinse for management of halitosis.
A survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 1082), and a pre-post study among a sample of consecutive coming-by volunteers (n = 292).
Participants of the representative sample rated their oral odor as 66.8 ± 17.2 and the consecutive volunteers as 70.9 ± 16.7 (range: 0-100). Sizable proportions (15.3 % and 38.1 %, respectively) indicated to always take into account their (bad) oral odor when meeting a person for the first time. The worse people perceived their oral odor, the more likely they were to take into account to keep a certain distance. Following the use of the oral rinse, a significant decline was found of the extent to which the participants reported to take into account their oral odor when meeting a person for the first time. Both studies identified a subgroup of individuals (9.1 % and 28.1 % respectively) who reported to keep a certain distance when meeting other people, despite a "fresh" self-perceived oral odor.
The results suggest that self-perceived oral odor negatively affects social interactions, and that adequate management of halitosis has the potential to improve such interactions.
In nursing home residents, it is not possible to distinguish pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia clinically. International literature reveals no consensus on which and how many characteristics and risk indicators must be present to diagnose (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. The aim of this survey was to reach consensus among a panel of clinical medical experts in geriatrics and pulmonology about the characteristics required for diagnosing pneumonia, and about the risk indicators needed to consider the diagnosis aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia.
Literature review and three expert-rating iterations using the electronically-modified Delphi Method were carried out. After each expert rating iteration, data analysis was performed. Qualitative responses and additional (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia characteristics which were mentioned in reply to structured open-ended questions were summarised, whilst similar responses were combined and these combinations were ordered by frequency in order to use them in the next iteration. Characteristics which failed to reach consensus were considered as inconclusive and eliminated. Consensus was reached when at least 70 % of the participants agreed.
Literature review revealed 16 currently used common characteristics for diagnosing (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia. No consensus was reached about characteristics and the number of characteristics required for diagnosing (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia. However, 57 % agreed that dyspnea, fever, deterioration of general functioning, tachypnea and crepitation with auscultation are the most important characteristics and the responses by the participants suggested that two or three characteristics should be present. Subsequently, 80 % of the participants agreed on the risk indicators dysphagia, choking incident, (history of) tube feeding, neurological disease and cognitive impairment for considering the diagnosis aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia.
No final consensus could be reached about which and how many characteristics are required for diagnosing pneumonia in nursing home residents. However, the results indicated that dyspnea, fever, deterioration of general functioning, tachypnea and crepitation with auscultation are characteristics of some importance and that at least two or three characteristics should be present. With regard to considering aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia, final consensus was reached about the risk indicators dysphagia, choking incident, (history of) tube feeding, neurological disease and cognitive impairment.
The objective of Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is to prevent carious lesion development and to stop its progression. This can be achieved, among other ways, by placing high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement sealants in pits and fissures in the enamel. A second area of utilisation is the treatment of dentine carious lesions. The weakened demineralised dentine can effectively be removed using hand instruments only. An accurately placed sealant-restoration prevents remaining cariogenic bacteria from reigniting the process of decay and allows the residual carious dentine to remineralise. To achieve good results using Atraumatic Restorative Treatment, an oral healthcare provider should complete a programme of instruction and have command of sufficient knowledge of cariology, the principles of treatment and the available restorative materials. High-viscosity glass-ionomer cement is the material of first choice for the prevention of enamel caries and the treatment of dentine carious lesions, but there is a constant search for improvements to this material and for a qualitatively better alternative. 
Het doel van de Atraumatic Restorative Treatment behelst het voorkomen van cariëslaesies en het stoppen van progressie ervan. Dit gebeurt onder andere door het verzegelen van putten en fissuren in glazuur met een glasionomeercement met een hoge viscositeitsgraad. Een tweede toepassingsgebied is de behandeling van dentinecariës. Het verweekte gedemineraliseerde dentine kan met handinstrumenten effectief worden verwijderd. Een zorgvuldig aangebrachte verzegelde restauratie zorgt ervoor dat achtergebleven cariogene bacteriën het cariësproces niet kunnen doen opvlammen en dat achtergebleven gedemineraliseerd dentine kan remineraliseren. Om goede resultaten met de Atraumatic Restorative Treatment te bereiken dient een zorgverlener een opleiding te volgen en over voldoende kennis te beschikken van de cariologie, de behandelprincipes en de beschikbare restauratiematerialen. Glasionomeercement met een hoge viscositeitsgraad is voor de preventie van glazuurcariës en de behandeling van dentinecariës het restauratiemateriaal van eerste keus, maar er wordt voortdurend gezocht naar verbetering van dit materiaal en naar een kwalitatief beter alternatief.
Pneumonia is an important cause of death in care home residents. Dysphagia and poor oral health are significant risk factors for developing aspiration pneumonia. Oral hygiene care reduces the number of oral bacteria and the risk of aspiration pneumonia. However, it is not clear yet which oral hygiene care intervention is most efficacious in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The aim of the study is to assess whether the application of a 0.05% chlorhexidine-containing solution in addition to the usual daily oral hygiene care reduces the incidence of pneumonia in physically disabled care home residents with dysphagia.
The study was designed as a multicentre cluster randomised controlled clinical trial, with care homes as units of randomisation. During 1 year, 500 physically disabled care home residents with dysphagia will be followed. The intervention consists of applying a 0.05% chlorhexidine-containing solution twice daily, immediately after the usual oral hygiene care, whereas the control group receives no application after the usual oral hygiene care. The primary outcome is the incidence of pneumonia diagnosed by a physician, using a set of strictly described criteria. The effect of the intervention on the incidence of pneumonia will be determined using a Cox regression analysis. The secondary outcomes are correlations between incidence of pneumonia, age, gender, diagnosed diseases, dysphagia severity, care dependency, actually used medication, number of teeth and implants present and the presence of removable dentures.
Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethical Committee of Radboud university medical centre: NL.nr: 41990.091.12. Written and informed consent will be obtained from all participating care homes and residents. The study's findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.
The trial has been registered in the Netherlands in the National Trial Register: TC=3515.
In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, presence of fibrosis is predictive of long-term liver-related complications. Currently, there are no reliable and non-invasive means of quantifying fibrosis in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a panel of non-invasive models in predicting fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
The accuracy of FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fibrosis 4 and four other non-invasive models in predicting fibrosis in those with biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was compared. These models were constructed post hoc in patients who had necessary clinical information collected within 2 months of a liver biopsy. The areas under receiver operating characteristics curves were compared for each model using Delong analysis. Optimum cut-off for each model and fibrosis stage were calculated using the Youden index.
The area under receiver operating characteristics curves for F ≥ 1 fibrosis for fibrosis 4 and FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was 0.821 and 0.801 respectively. For F ≥ 3, the area under receiver operating characteristics curves was 0.866 for fibrosis 4 and 0.862 for FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Delong analysis showed the area under receiver operating characteristics curves was statistically different for fibrosis 4 and FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared with BARD, BAAT and aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio for F ≥ 1 and F ≥ 3. Area under receiver operating characteristics curves were significantly different for fibrosis 4 and FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease for F ≥ 3 compared with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score. At a fixed sensitivity of 90%, FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease had the highest specificity for F ≥ 1 (52.4%) and F ≥ 3 (63.8%). In contrast, at a fixed specificity of 90%, fibrosis 4 outperformed other models with a sensitivity of 60.2% for F ≥ 1 and 70.6% for F ≥ 3 fibrosis.
These non-invasive models of fibrosis can predict varying degrees of fibrosis from routinely collected clinical information in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
In 1990, the thesis 'Removable complete dentures in older people, an issue dealing with adaptability?' was published. Among other things, this thesis aimed at finding a method of measuring older people's adaptability to removable complete dentures. Its conclusion was that a subscale of the "Beoordelingsschaal voor Oudere Patiënten" (Rating scale for older patients) had predictive value. Subsequently, only a few research projects on this topic have been carried out. They dealt with demonstrated adaptation achieved after treatment, the realised adaptation. The results were disappointing. Ever since the availability of endosseous oral implants, research into adaptability to conventional removable complete dentures seems less relevant. During the last decades, inquiries into a method of measuring treatment effectiveness has focused on older people's quality of life and general health condition. However, to assess with respect to oral health care an older person's general health condition and load-taking capacity adequately, some experience is indispensable. 
In 1990 verscheen het proefschrift ‘Een kunstgebit bij ouderen, een kwestie van aanpassen?’. Het onderzoek dat er aan ten grondslag lag, betrof onder andere het vinden van een meetinstrument voor het aanpassingsvermogen van ouderen aan volledige gebitsprothesen. De conclusie was dat een subschaal van de Beoordelingsschaal voor Oudere Patiënten voorspellende waarde had. Hierna zijn over dit onderwerp slechts enkele nieuwe onderzoeken uitgevoerd. Die gingen over de aangetoonde aanpassing achteraf, de gerealiseerde aanpassing. De resultaten waren teleurstellend. Omdat sinds de beschikbaarheid van orale implantaten veel implantaatgedragen gebitsprothesen zijn vervaardigd, lijkt onderzoek naar het aanpassingsvermogen aan volledige gebitsprothesen ook minder relevant. Het zoeken naar een meetinstrument voor de doelmatigheid van behandelingen heeft zich in de laatste decennia vooral gericht op de levenskwaliteit en op de algemene conditie van een oudere. Om in de mondzorg tot een goede beoordeling van de algemene conditie en daarmee van de belastbaarheid van een oudere te komen, is ervaring echter onontbeerlijk.
In 1989, the dissertation 'Oral self-care for dentate elderly' was published. Among other things, the effect of an information leaflet on oral self-care was investigated in a randomised, controlled trial. The outcome of the entire intervention was positive. Subsequent to this dissertation no comparable research has been carried out in the Netherlands or abroad. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the oral self-care of dentate older people. To improve the oral (self-)care of nursing home residents, carers should be educated theoretically and practically, preferably during their professional training. With regard to older people living at home, oral healthcare providers should assess whether their oral health condition will be stable for the rest of their life, at the latest when their general health condition is beginning to deteriorate. Determining factors in this regard are a stable dentition that can easily be kept clean, particularly when oral implants are present. As soon as older people who are living at home become dependent, they will require support. Oral health care providers should, then, make sure that their practices physically accessible and should be prepared to deliver care at home. 
In 1989 verscheen het proefschrift ‘Orale zelfzorg voor dentate ouderen’. Onder andere een informatiebrochure over orale zelfzorg werd getest in een gerandomiseerd gecontroleerd onderzoek. De uitkomst van de gehele interventie was positief. Na dit promotie­onderzoek is in Nederland en daarbuiten geen vergelijkbaar onderzoek uitgevoerd. Toch zijn er zorgen over de orale zelfzorg van dentate ouderen. Voor een betere mondverzorging van verpleeghuisbewoners moeten verzorgenden theoretisch en praktisch worden onderwezen, het liefst al tijdens hun opleiding. Voor thuiswonende ouderen geldt dat mondzorgverleners moeten beoordelen of de mondgezondheid levensduurbestendig is ultimo het moment dat zich een achteruitgang in de medische conditie aandient. Centrale factoren hierbij zijn stabiliteit en reinigbaarheid van de dentitie, ook en vooral als deze is aangevuld met orale implantaten. Zodra bij thuiswonende ouderen sprake is van zorgafhankelijkheid moeten zij worden ondersteund, waarbij mondzorgverleners moeten zorgen voor goede fysieke toegankelijk van hun praktijken en bereidheid tonen thuiszorg te verlenen.
This study aims to investigate the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to determine the metabolic risk factors of this disease, and to predict nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis in women of different ages and body mass index (BMI).
In 2010-2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,360 women at the health checkup center of Zhongnan Hospital (Wuhan, China). The probability of NASH with liver fibrosis was predicted using BAAT (BMI, age, alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides) score.
The prevalence of NAFLD increased from 5.3% to 18.8% in women younger than 45 years versus women aged 45 to 55 years and rose to 27.8% in women older than 55 years. In obese women, the prevalence of NAFLD was 48.4%. Women older than 45 years and obese women with NAFLD had more unfavorable metabolic risk factors. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased BMI and low aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio were closely related to NAFLD in women of different ages, whereas increasing BMI, BAAT score, age, high triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and low aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio were all closely related to NAFLD in obese women. The prevalence of NASH with a BAAT index of 3 or higher was 13.2% and 14.9% in women older than 55 years and obese women with NAFLD, respectively.
Obese and postmenopausal women have a high prevalence of NAFLD and severe metabolic disorders. The prevalence of NASH seems to be considerably higher in obese and postmenopausal women with NAFLD.
Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of both polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The main aim of the present study was the evaluation of non-invasive indices of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in PCOS women with or without metabolic syndrome (MetS).
In this cross-sectional study, three non-invasive indices for hepatic steatosis [NAFLD liver fat score, lipid accumulation product (LAP) and hepatic steatosis index (HIS)] and four for fibrosis [FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), body mass index (BMI)-Age-Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-Triglycerides (BAAT) and BMI AST/ALT Ratio Diabetes (BARD)] were calculated in 314 PCOS women (77 with, 237 without MetS) and 78 controls.
All steatosis indices were significantly higher in the PCOS than the control group (NAFLD liver fat score: -0.139 ± 0.117 vs. -0.976 ± 0.159, p&lt;0.001; LAP: 43.3 ± 1.9 vs. 34.7 ± 3.1, p=0.036; HIS: 44.6 ± 0.5 vs. 42.1 ± 0.8, p=0.016). FIB-4 and BAAT [fibrosis stage (F)2-4] were higher in the PCOS group (0.480 ± 0.020 vs. 0.400 ± 0.013, p&lt;0.001; and 15.6% vs. 5.1%, respectively), whereas APRI and BARD were not. All steatosis indices were significantly higher in PCOS women with than without MetS (NAFLD liver fat score: 1.874 ± 0.258 vs. -0.793 ± 0.099, p&lt;0.001; LAP: 76.8 ± 4.9 vs. 33.4 ± 1.4, p&lt;0.001; and HIS: 49.8 ± 1 vs. 43 ± 0.5, p&lt;0.001). Of the fibrosis indices, only BAAT (F2-4: 50.6% vs. 4.2%) was higher in PCOS women with MetS.
Non-invasive indices of hepatic steatosis were significantly higher in PCOS, especially in the presence of MetS, whereas indices of hepatic fibrosis yielded controversial results. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis indices in PCOS women.
Growth and fatness traits are economically important in the pig industry. To dissect the genetic architecture of these traits in commercial pigs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for carcass weight, backfat thickness, and body weight in two commercial populations: Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire) (DLY) and Duroc populations. To enhance the detection power, three GWAS approaches including single-trait GWAS, multi-trait GWAS and meta-analysis were used in this study. A total of 13 suggestive loci were identified on nine chromosomes. The most significant locus was detected at 272.05 Mb on SSC1, and it was associated with backfat thickness at the first rib in the DLY population. Three genes at the identified loci (TBC1D1, BAAT and PHLPP1) were highlighted as functionally plausible candidate genes for pig growth and fatness traits. Genome-wide significant locus was not evidenced in this study, indicating that large populations are required to identify QTL with minor effects on growth and fatness traits in commercial pig populations, in which intensively artificial selections have been imposed on these traits and small genetical variances usually retain in these traits.
We have measured the momentum distributions of singly and doubly charged helium ions created in the focus of 220 fs, 800 nm laser pulses at intensities of (2.9-6.6)x10(14) W/cm(2). All ions are emitted strongly aligned along the direction of polarization of the light. We find the typical momenta of the He2+ ions to be 5-10 times larger than those of the He1+ ions and a two peak structure at the highest intensity.
Recent studies have proposed a connection between the individual alpha band peak frequency and the temporal resolution of visual perception in healthy human participants. This connection rests on animal studies describing oscillations in the alpha band as a mode of phasic thalamocortical information transfer for low-level visual stimuli, which critically relies on GABAergic interneurons. Here, we investigated the interplay of these parameters by measuring occipital alpha band peak frequency by means of magnetoencephalography, visual temporal resolution by means of behavioral testing, and occipital GABA levels by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Importantly, we investigated a sample of healthy participants and patients with varying grades of hepatic encephalopathy, which are known to exhibit decreases in the investigated parameters, thus providing an increased parameter space. We found that occipital alpha band peak frequency and visual temporal resolution were positively correlated, i.e., higher occipital alpha band peak frequencies were on average related to a higher temporal resolution. Likewise, occipital alpha band peak frequency correlated positively with occipital GABA levels. However, correlations were significant only when both healthy participants and patients were included in the analysis, thereby indicating a connection of the measures on group level (instead of the individual level). These findings provide new insights into neurophysiological and neurochemical underpinnings of visual perception.
Defect perovskites (He2-x□x)(CaZr)F6 can be prepared by inserting helium into CaZrF6 at high pressure. They can be recovered to ambient pressure at low temperature. There are no prior examples of perovskites with noble gases on the A-sites. The insertion of helium gas into CaZrF6 both elastically stiffens the material and reduces the magnitude of its negative thermal expansion. It also suppresses the onset of structural disorder, which is seen on compression in other media. Measurements of the gas released on warming to room temperature and Rietveld analyses of neutron diffraction data at low temperature indicate that exposure to helium gas at 500 MPa leads to a stoichiometry close to (He1□1)(CaZr)F6. Helium has a much higher solubility in CaZrF6 than silica glass or crystobalite. An analogue with composition (H2)2(CaZr)F6 would have a volumetric hydrogen storage capacity greater than current US DOE targets. We anticipate that other hybrid perovskites with small neutral molecules on the A-site can also be prepared and that they will display a rich structural chemistry.
Objective. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the usability of the telehealth system, coined Telekit, by using an iterative, mixed usability approach. Materials and Methods. Ten double experts participated in two heuristic evaluations (HE1, HE2), and 11 COPD patients attended two think-aloud tests. The double experts identified usability violations and classified them into Jakob Nielsen's heuristics. These violations were then translated into measurable values on a scale of 0 to 4 indicating degree of severity. In the think-aloud tests, COPD participants were invited to verbalise their thoughts. Results. The double experts identified 86 usability violations in HE1 and 101 usability violations in HE2. The majority of the violations were rated in the 0-2 range. The findings from the think-aloud tests resulted in 12 themes and associated examples regarding the usability of the Telekit system. The use of the iterative, mixed usability approach produced both quantitative and qualitative results. Conclusion. The iterative, mixed usability approach yields a strong result owing to the high number of problems identified in the tests because the double experts and the COPD participants focus on different aspects of Telekit's usability. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01984840, November 14, 2013.
High molecular weight organic compounds (HMW-OCs), formed as secondary organic aerosols (SOA), have been reported in many laboratory studies. However, little evidence of HMW-OCs formation, in particular during winter season in the real atmosphere, has been reported. In January 2013, Beijing faced historically severe haze pollution, in which the hourly PM2.5 concentration reached as high as 974 μg m-3. Four typical haze events (HE1 to HE4) were identified, and HE2 (Jan. 9-16) was the most serious of these. Based on the hourly observed chemical composition of PM2.5 and the daily organic composition analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), we found that abundant ion peaks in m/z 200-850 appeared on heavy haze days, whereas these were negligible on a clear day, indicating the existence of HMW-OCs in the wintertime haze. A negative nonlinear correlation between HMW-OCs and O3 suggested that gas oxidation was not likely to be the dominant mechanism for HMW-OCs formation. During the heavy haze events, the relative humidity and mass ratio of H2O/PM2.5 reached as high as 80% and 0.2, respectively. The high water content and its good positive correlation with HMW-OCs indicated that an aqueous-phase process may be a significant pathway in wintertime. The evidence that acidity was much higher during HE2 (0.37 μg m-3) than on other days, as well as its strong correlation with HMW-OCs, indicated that acid-catalyzed reactions likely resulted in HMW-OCs formation during the heavy winter haze in Beijing.
A comparative proteomic study of oligoasthenozoospermic and normozoospermic seminal plasmas was conducted to establish differences in protein expression. Oligoasthenozoospermia (when semen presents with a low concentration and reduced motility of spermatozoa) is common in male infertility. Two-dimensional protein maps from seminal plasma samples from 10 men with normozoospermia and 10 men with idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia were obtained by isoelectric focusing followed by sodium dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Map images were analysed using dedicated software involving normalization, spot-to-spot volume comparison and statistical treatment of the results to establish the significance of differences between normal and oligoasthenozoospermic samples. Six out of 1028 spots showed over 1.5-fold relative intensity differences (P &lt; 0.05, analysis of variance). Four proteins were identified by nano liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry of their tryptic peptides and database searches. Two proteins were more than three-fold under-expressed in oligoasthenozoospermia, namely epididymal secretory protein E1 and galectin-3-binding protein; the other (lipocalin-1 and a prolactin-inducible protein form) were over-expressed. The identity and differential expression of epididymal secretory protein E1 was verified by Western-blotting. The statistically significant differential expression of these four proteins in oligoasthenozoospermia compared with normozoospermia provides a molecular basis for further investigations into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia. 
The present study was conducted to identify the major seminal plasma protein profile of boars and its associations with semen criteria. Semen samples were collected from 12 adult boars and subjected to evaluation of sperm parameters (motility, morphology, vitality, and percent of cells with intact acrosome). Seminal plasma was obtained by centrifugation, analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and proteins identified by mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight). We tested regression models using spot intensities related to the same proteins as independent variables and semen parameters as dependent variables (P ≤ 0.05). One hundred twelve spots were identified in the boar seminal plasma gels, equivalent to 39 different proteins. Spermadhesin porcine seminal protein (PSP)-I and PSP-II, as well as spermadhesins AQN-1, AQN-3 and AWN-1 represented 45.2 ± 8% of the total intensity of all spots. Other proteins expressed in the boar seminal plasma included albumin, complement proteins (complement factor H precursor, complement C3 precursor and adipsin/complement factor D), immunoglobulins (IgG heavy chain precursor, IgG delta heavy chain membrane bound form, IgG gamma-chain, Ig lambda chain V-C region PLC3, and CH4 and secreted domains of swine IgM), IgG-binding proteins, epididymal-specific lipocalin 5, epididymal secretory protein E1 precursor, epididymal secretory glutathione peroxidase precursor, transferrin, lactotransferrin and fibronectin type 1 (FN1). On the basis of the regression analysis, the percentage of sperm with midpiece defects was related to the amount of CH4 and secreted domains of swine IgM and FN1 (r² = 0.58, P = 0.006), IgG-binding protein (r² = 0.41, P = 0.024), complement factor H precursor (r² = 0.61, P = 0.014) and lactadherin (r² = 0.45, P = 0.033). The percentage of sperm with tail defects was also related to CH4 and secreted domains of swine IgM and FN1 (r² = 0.40, P = 0.034), IgG-binding protein (r² = 0.35, P = 0.043) and lactadherin (r² = 0.74, P = 0.001). Sperm motility, in turn, had association with the intensities of spots identified as lactadherin (r² = 0.48, P = 0.027). In conclusion, we presently describe the major proteome of boar seminal plasma and significant associations between specific seminal plasma proteins and semen parameters. Such relationships will serve as the basis for determination of molecular markers of sperm function in the swine species.
Unexplained male infertility (UMI) is a condition in which routine semen analysis fails to detect subcellular sperm dysfunctions. In the present research, a comparative proteomics study of seminal plasma (SP) was conducted in men with unexplained infertility whose female partners had undergone in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment to find differences in the SP protein profile. Five UMI men with successful and eight with unsuccessful IVF outcome enrolled in this study. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) technique was used for protein separation. The differentially expressed proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. Results indicated that at least two different protein spots, including clusterin and epididymal secretory protein E1, were over-expressed (1.5- and 2-fold change, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) while prostate-specific antigen was downregulated (0.3-fold change, p &lt; 0.05) in the successful group as compared with the unsuccessful group. Considering the role of all three identified proteins in the sperm quality, the results of the present study introduced these proteins as new candidate biomarkers for success of IVF in UMI couples.
The objective was to determine the relationship between seminal plasma proteins and sperm morphology in Bos indicus bulls of the Brahman breed. Fifty-six 24-month-old Australian Brahman bulls were electroejaculated and samples were examined to determine the percentage of morphologically normal sperm (PNS24) and the seminal plasma protein composition was identified and quantified by 2-D gel electrophoresis. The total integrated optical density of 152 seminal plasma protein spots (SPPs) across all gels was determined using the PDQuest software version 8.0 (Bio Rad, USA). Using a single regression mixed model with the density of individual spots as a covariate for PNS24, 17 SPPs were significantly associated with PNS24 (p&lt;0.05). A multiple regression analyses of these SPPs, using three models; non-parametric Tree Model, Generalized Additive Model, and a step-wise selection method were conducted, and 6 SPPs could be used to predict PNS24; four SPPs had positive and two had negative association with PNS24. Together these spots explained 35% of the phenotypic variation in PNS24. Using mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF and TripleToF-MS) the SPPs with positive relationship contained mainly apolipoprotein A-I (1310), protein DJ-1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 (2308), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (6402) and apolipoprotein A-I and secretoglobin family 1D member (8008). The SPPs inversely associated with PNS24 were clusterin/seminal plasma protein A3 (1411) and epididymal secretory protein E1 (8108). This is the first comprehensive report on the association between seminal plasma protein composition in Bos indicus Brahman bulls and sperm morphology. 
We aimed to investigate the comparative cardiovascular benefits of high-dose statin, ezetimibe-statin, and PCSK9 inhibitor-statin treatments in secondary prevention patients.Methods and Results:We selected 12 randomized controlled trials (n=131,978 patients) using PubMed and Embase (inception-June 1, 2018). Subgroup differences were explored by meta-regression and Cochran Q test. The relative effects of high-dose statin, ezetimibe-statin, and PCSK9 inhibitor-statin on major cardiovascular events (MACE), and revascularization were varied and decreased gradually, of which high-dose statin resulted in lower risk of MACE and revascularization than PCSK9 inhibitor-statin per 1 mmol/L reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): risk ratio (RR) for MACE, 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-0.90) for high-dose statin, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96) for ezetimibe-statin, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96) for PCSK9 inhibitor-statin; RR for revascularization, 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.90) for high-dose statin, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81-1.00) for ezetimibe-statin, and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97) for PCSK9 inhibitor-statin. Similar relative effects of intensive lipid-lowering treatment were also observed in analyses of myocardial infarction and stroke, although no significant difference between groups was identified.
In secondary prevention patients, the relative benefits of high-dose statin, ezetimibe-statin, and PCSK9 inhibitor-statin treatments were varied and decreased gradually, of which high-dose statin was significantly superior to PCSK9 inhibitor-statin for improving MACE and revascularization per 1 mmol/L reduction of LDL-C.
Numerous studies have demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events when the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) level is decreased by statin therapy. However, despite good control of LDL, cardiovascular events may increase if the triglyceride (TG) level is high. We conducted a long-term comparison of treatment of hypertriglyceridemia with ethyl icosapentate (EPA) vs. omega-3-acid ethyl (EPA+docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]).Methods and Results:Cardiac surgery patients with hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to an EPA group (1.8 g t.i.d.) or an EPA+DHA group (2 g s.i.d.) and observed for 3 years. The primary endpoints were the serum TG level and its percent change. Secondary endpoints included lipid markers, fatty acid parameters, serum creatinine, cystatin-C, oxidized LDL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and MACCE. An interview to assess study drug adherence was conducted 6 months after completing the study. TG levels were significantly lower in the EPA+DHA group than in the EPA group. Levels of remnant-like particles-cholesterol, oxidized LDL, and cystatin-C were also significantly lower in the EPA+DHA group than in the EPA group. Compliance with treatment was significantly worse in the EPA group.
Better results were obtained in the EPA+DHA group, but more patients showed poor compliance with treatment in the EPA group, making detailed comparison of the 2 groups difficult. Even so, TG were reduced while EPA and DHA levels were increased in the EPA+DHA group, together with a reduction in oxidative stress and remnant-like particles-cholesterol. Decreased compliance with medication in the EPA group significantly affected the results of this study, clearly indicating the importance of good compliance.
To assess sex-related differences in forearm skin microvascular reactivity to vascular occlusion and cardiovascular health in young healthy women and men.
203 young healthy individuals (67 men/136 women) participated in this study. Post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) in skin microcirculation following 1', 2' and 3' vascular occlusion period was assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry. Anthropometric parameters, body composition, blood pressure, heart rate and biochemical parameters were measured in all participants. Correlations between PORH and measured parameters were determined by using corresponding tests.
Women had significantly higher forearm PORH following 1', 2' and 3' vascular occlusion than men. Women had lower body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, but higher fat mass than men. Men had significantly higher blood pressure and lower heart rate than women. Also, women had lower hemoglobin, urea, creatinine and serum uric acid, but higher HDL cholesterol level than men. PORH was negatively associated with waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure only in women.
Young healthy women exhibit higher skin microvascular reactivity to vascular occlusion compared to age-matched men. Increased systolic blood pressure or central obesity (waist-to-hip ratio) may pose greater risk to young healthy women than men by adversely affecting peripheral microvascular function.
Zinc depletion during diabetes postulates a role for zinc nutrition in the management of associated complications. The present study evaluated zinc supplementation for countering the compromised intestinal integrity through moderation of oxidative stress and suppression of stress-stimulated inflammatory proliferation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were provided with supplemental zinc for six weeks (5 and 10-times of normal level). Supplemental zinc nurtured diabetic groups evidenced a significant reversal of the disruption of intestinal ultra structure. While the brush border membrane (BBM) of diabetic animals showed decreased fluidity with increased cholesterol: phospholipid ratio and altered polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio, the same was countered in zinc supplementation. A stimulated activity of BBM-bound enzymes suggested a modulation in membrane dynamics in diabetic condition which was moderated in zinc treatment. Higher expression of the lipid oxidative markers, oxidative stress markers, concomitant inflammatory markers, cytokines, fibrosis factors and apoptotic regulatory proteins in the intestines were curbed by zinc supplementation. The pathological aberrations of the intestinal architecture in diabetic animals were similarly reverted. Thus, supplemental zinc has a favourable consequence in restricting the compromised intestinal health in diabetes which was exerted through a defensive stimulus on oxidative stress induced cytokines, inflammatory propagation, and subsequent injury.
The eukaryotic plasma membrane has an asymmetric distribution of its component lipids. Rafts that result from liquid-liquid phase separation are a feature of its exoplasmic leaflet, but how these exoplasmic leaflet domains are coupled to the cytoplasmic leaflet is not understood. These rafts can be studied in model membranes of three-component mixtures that produce coexisting liquid ordered (Lo) and liquid disordered (Ld) domains. We conducted all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of compositionally asymmetric lipid bilayers that reflect a more realistic model of the plasma membrane. One leaflet contained phase-separated domains with phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, representing the exoplasmic leaflet, whereas the other contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol, which are the predominant components of the cytoplasmic leaflet. Inspired by findings of domain alignment across the two leaflets in compositionally symmetric model membranes, we examined the coupling between the two leaflets to see how the single-phase cytoplasmic leaflet would respond to phase separation in the other leaflet and if information could be communicated across the membrane. We found the region of the single-phase leaflet apposing the Lo domain to be slightly more ordered and thicker than the region apposing the Ld domain. The region across from the Lo domain is somewhat enriched in cholesterol and significantly depleted of polyunsaturated lipids.
The underlying molecular mechanisms associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk have only been partially revealed using traditional approaches such as univariate GWAS and linkage-based analyses. We therefore aimed to identify gene clusters related to EEG neurobiological phenotypes distinctive to individuals with AUD using a multivariate approach.
The current project adopted a bi-multivariate data-driven approach, parallel independent component analysis (para-ICA) to derive and explore significant genotype-phenotype associations in a case-control subset of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) dataset. Para-ICA subjects comprised N=799 self-reported European-Americans (367 controls and 432 AUD cases), recruited from COGA, who had undergone resting EEG and genotyping. Both EEG and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were preprocessed prior to being subjected to para-ICA in order to derive genotype-phenotype relationships.
From the data, 4 EEG frequency and 4 SNP components were estimated, with 2 significantly correlated EEG-genetic relationship pairs. The first such pair primarily represented theta activity, negatively correlated to a genetic cluster enriched for (but not limited to) ontologies/disease processes representing cell signaling, neurogenesis, transmembrane drug transportation, alcoholism, and lipid/cholesterol metabolism. The second component pair represented mainly alpha activity, positively correlated with a genetic cluster with ontologies similarly enriched as the first component. Disease-related enrichments for this component revealed heart and autoimmune disorders as top hits. Loading coefficients for both the alpha and theta components were significantly reduced in cases compared to controls.
Our data suggest plausible multifactorial genetic components, primarily enriched for neuronal/synaptic signaling/transmission, immunity and neurogenesis, mediating low-frequency alpha and theta abnormalities in alcohol addiction. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
To determine the longitude lipid profiles in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and to investigate the relationship between lipid disturbances in the 1st trimester and GDM.Blood samples were collected from 1283 normal pregnant women and 300 women with GDM. Serum lipids which include total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured and the TG/HDL-C ratio was calculated in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and then we got the longitudinal lipid profiles. We compared the differences of lipid profiles between patients with GDM and normal pregnant women using 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Also additional propensity-based subgroup analyses were performed. The logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the lipid disturbances in the 1st trimester and GDM.TG, TC, LDL-C concentrations, and TG/HDL-C ratio increased progressively throughout pregnancy; while HDL-C amounts increased from the 1st to the 2nd trimester with a slight decrease in the 3rd trimester. The GDM group showed higher TG concentrations, higher TG/HDL-C ratio, and lower HDL-C concentrations throughout pregnancy. There were no significant differences in TC and LDL-C concentrations in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters (P &gt; .05), between the GDM group and the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed that maternal age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and TG/HDL ratio in the 1st trimester were associated with an increased risk of GDM.The lipid profile alters significantly in patients with GDM, and maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, and TG/HDL ratio in the 1st trimester were associated with an increased risk of GDM.
Angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3) is an inhibitor of both lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase in humans. Population studies indicate a relationship between loss of function mutations in ANGPTL3 and favorable reductions in triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol. In addition, loss of function mutations are associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. While ANGPTL3's role in human lipid metabolism has yet to be fully clarified, it is unlikely that ANGPTL3 impacts cholesterol uptake via the LDL-receptor, unlike the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin9 inhibitors. In contrast to other forms of lipid-lowering therapy, ANGPTL3 inhibition may improve insulin sensitivity. The promise of this new therapy, particularly its independence from the LDL-receptor, has prompted the creation of a monoclonal antibody inhibitor; evinacumab. Evinacumab has shown favorable lipid-lowering action in both human and mouse models. Efficacy trials are currently ongoing and will be completed in the near future. In addition, ANGPTL3 inhibition via an antisense oligonucleotide was performed in healthy human subjects, which resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in circulating ANGPTL3 levels and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile. When tested in mouse models, administration of the antisense oligonucleotide caused a reduction in progression of atherosclerosis. Further investigation is required to evaluate the efficacy, safety and net benefit of clinical ANGPTL3 inhibition before it can be accepted into clinical practice.
Anthracycline (doxorubicin) and trastuzumab treatments for cancer patients have been known to cause cardiotoxicity. The current recommendations for prevention of cardiac events from cancer chemotherapies are largely based on opinion. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends active screening and prevention of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The risk factors are defined as tobacco use, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, alcohol use, obesity and physical inactivity. Beta-adrenergic blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been the mainstay of treatment for heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction for many years. This review analyzed the use of beta-adrenergic blockers and ACE inhibitors/ARBs as protection against cardiomyopathy caused by anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Although many more studies are warranted, it was concluded that the addition of a beta-blocker early in the treatment of cancer patients who are undergoing anthracycline or trastuzumab treatment can have beneficial effects in preserving left ventricular ejection fraction and preventing chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The effects are more apparent in the short term. More studies of the long-term effects are warranted, as are the additive effects of using a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor/ARB together to prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.
Prior research has demonstrated that the daily experience of negative affect is associated with increased levels of proinflammatory activity as evidenced by higher interleukin-6 among Americans but not among Japanese. This cultural difference may be driven by culturally divergent beliefs about negative affect as a source of threat to self-image versus as natural and integral to life. Here, we examined whether culture may moderate the relationship between negative affect and biological stress responses, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. By using culturally matched surveys of Americans (N = 761) and Japanese (N = 328), we found that negative affect was associated with a flattening of the diurnal cortisol slope among Americans after controlling for demographic variables, personality traits, sleep patterns, and health behaviors. In contrast, the association between negative affect and the HPA axis activity was negligible among Japanese. Moreover, we assessed biological health risk with biomarkers of both inflammation (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels) and cardiovascular function (higher systolic blood pressure and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio) and found that the relationship between negative affect and increased biological health risk, which was observed only among Americans, was mediated by the flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health.

The nutritional and metabolic status alters the peripheral taste perception and food intake by participating in the modulation of taste information integration. The taste receptors and neuropeptides in the taste buds are the important targets of this modulation process. To explore the effects of nutritional status on the expressions of galanin and its receptors in the taste buds, we compared the mRNA levels of galanin and its specific receptor GalR2 in the taste buds among the high-fat diet induced obese rats (HF), chronically restricted diet rats (CR) and control rats. The high-fat diet, half of chow diet, and normal chow diet were given to HF, CR and control groups for 6 weeks, respectively. The body weight and some metabolic indexes, including blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were detected. The mRNA expressions of galanin and its receptors in taste buds were determined using real-time PCR. Results showed that compared with control rats, the body weights, levels of blood glucose and triglyceride were significantly elevated in HF rats; while the mRNA expressions of galanin and GalR2 were dramatically decreased. However, galanin mRNA expression in CR rats was increased to 2.3 times of that in control group. Considering the results obtained from our previous studies, we conclude that the behavioral changes in tasting choice of HF rats may be related to the expressions of galanin and GalR2 in the taste buds. The changes of galanin and GalR2 in taste buds are involved in the peripheral mechanism of nutritional status regulating taste perception and feeding behavior in rats.
Bay leaf, one of the plants in Indonesia that has been shown to have activities to reduce cholesterol in the blood. HMG-CoA Reductase inhibition is one of many mechanisms in lowering the level of cholesterol in the blood. Here, we reported the inhibitory activity of HMG-CoA Reductase of bay leaves ethanol extracts that we suspected to be the mechanism of action of bay leaves in reducing cholesterol in the blood. In this research we also investigated the correlation between the inhibitory activities, the total phenol content and antioxidant activities of bay leaves (Syzygium polianthum) ethanol extracts.
The inhibitory activity of HMG-CoA Reductase was determined kinetically at 340 nm using simvastatin as positive control. In vitro scavenging assays of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and beta-carotene method were used to determine the antioxidant activities. The total phenolic content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu's method.
The IC50 of bay leaves ethanolic extract obtained by percolation and soxhlet extraction method towards HMG-CoA Reductase enzyme activity were 49.50 ± 0.700 μg/mL and 15.50 ± 0.707 μg/mL, respectively, while the IC50 of simvastatin was 0.00238 ± 0.00004 μg/mL. The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of bay leaves ethanolic extract obtained by Soxhlet extraction method was higher compared to the percolation method (DPPH and beta-carotene assay results). The 3D linear analysis showed that there was a high correlation between the inhibition activities of HMG-CoA Reductase pattern of both extract types and the total phenol pattern and also the antioxidant pattern of these extracts.
The result showed that the bay leaves ethanolic extract have a potent activity to reduce the cholesterol serum level by inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase activity. The activity was due to the phenolic compounds in the extracts as well as the antioxidant activity of the extracts.
The present study aims to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. A literature search was conducted in PubMedTM, Google ScholarTM, and ScopusTM up to March 2018. Twenty randomized controlled trials met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in glycemic indices including fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and in lipid markers including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Subgroup analyses were performed based on intervention and study quality. Compared to controls, zinc supplementation significantly reduced the concentrations of both FBG and HbA1c (FBG WMD: -19.66 mg/dL, 95% CI: -33.71, -5.62; HbA1c WMD: -0.43 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.80, -0.07). The pooled estimate showed a significant decrease in serum TC and LDL-c, and increase in serum HDL-c levels in treatment group compared with the control group (TC WMD: -18.51 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.36, -15.66; LDL-c WMD: -4.80 mg/dL, 95% CI: -6.07, -3.53; HDL-c WMD: 1.45 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.51). Subgroup analysis of "no co-supplement" intervention demonstrated significant differences for mean changes in HDL-c and FBG levels, whereas subgroup analysis of high quality studies showed significant differences for mean changes of LDL-c, HDL-c, and FBG levels. Results suggested that zinc supplementation reduces FBG, HbA1c and LDL-c levels and increases HDL-C levels; however, these changes were related to intervention and quality of studies.
Despite several studies examining single dietary fats on type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, little is known about the effects of multiple fatty acids on the risk of T2D. We aimed to address this question in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) population. Dietary intakes of participants without T2D (n=2,139) were assessed using the validated food frequency questionnaire. To assess the risk of T2D after 6 years of follow-up, we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Three major dietary fat patterns were: (1) high amounts of dietary cholesterol, saturated fats, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and trans fats; (2) high amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fats; and (3) high amounts of dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. Dietary total fat intake hazard ratio [HR=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.77~2.23 and HR=0.69, 95% CI=0.27~1.76, in the second and third tertile, respectively] was not related to the development of T2D. Animal- and plant-based dietary fat intakes were additionally not related to the risk of T2D. After adjustment for confounding variables, there was no significant association between dietary fat pattern score and T2D incidence. Whereas, the third pattern had a borderline negative association with diabetes development (HR=0.56, 95% CI=0.29~1.07). These novel data suggest that dietary fat composition may modify the risk of T2D incidence.
Previous studies indicated that a high proportion of adults with diabetes do not receive recommended preventive care in the United States. Nevertheless, a comprehensive evaluation of the factors associated with the receipt of most recommended preventive care measures collectively is lacking. Therefore, this study describes the utilization of multiple preventive care measures collectively. Moreover, this paper aims to identify factors associated with receiving the recommended preventive care. A cross-sectional study design was implemented using data from multiple panels (2009-2015) of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The sample included adults aged 21 years or older with diabetes (n = 8415). The outcome for this study was either receiving five selected preventive care measures (HbA1c tests, cholesterol tests, foot examinations, dilated eye examinations, and influenza vaccines) collectively or not. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among all adults with diabetes, those with multimorbidity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) or eye complications. Adults with diabetes were poorly adherent to receiving the five preventive care measures collectively (15.6%). Among all adults with diabetes, factors associated with receiving all the selected preventive practices included age, education, health insurance, prescription drug coverage, duration of diabetes, number of chronic conditions and smoking status. Similar results were observed among adults with multimorbidity. Among adults with CKD, those with private insurance and drug prescription coverage were more likely to receive the recommended practices. The findings suggest low adherence to receiving all five recommended practices. It is crucial to increase the awareness about the need for all the recommended practices among adults with diabetes.
Gene-diet interaction studies have reported that individual variations in phenotypic traits may be due to variations in individual diet. Our study aimed to evaluate (i) the association of ADRB2 rs1042713 with obesity and obesity-related metabolic parameters and (ii) the effect of dietary nutrients on these associations in Malaysian adults. ADRB2 genotyping, dietary, physical activity, anthropometric, and biochemical data were collected from 79 obese and 99 nonobese individuals. Logistic regression revealed no association between ADRB2 rs1042713 and obesity (p=0.725). However, the carriers of G allele (AG + GG genotypes) of rs1042713 were associated with increased odds of insulin resistance, 2.83 (CI = 1.04-7.70, adjusted p=0.042), in the dominant model, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Obese individuals carrying the G allele were associated with higher total cholesterol (p=0.011), LDL cholesterol levels (p=0.008), and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (p=0.048), compared to the noncarriers (AA), even after adjusting for potential confounders. Irrespective of obesity, the carriers of GG genotype had significantly lower fasting glucose levels with low saturated fatty acid intake (&lt;7.3% of TE/day) (4.92 ± 0.1 mmol/L vs 5.80 ± 0.3 mmol/L, p=0.011) and high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid:saturated fatty acid ratio (≥0.8/day) (4.83 ± 0.1 mmol/L vs 5.93 ± 0.4 mmol/L, p=0.006). Moreover, the carriers of GG genotype with high polyunsaturated fatty acid intake (≥6% of TE/day) had significantly lower HOMA-IR (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.7, p=0.026) and fasting insulin levels (6.8 ± 1.6 µU/mL vs 11.4 ± 2.1 µU/mL, p=0.036). These effects were not found in the noncarriers (AA). In conclusion, G allele carriers of ADRB2 rs1042713 were associated with increased odds of insulin resistance. Obese individuals carrying G allele were compromised with higher blood lipid levels. Although it is premature to report gene-diet interaction on the regulation of glucose and insulin levels in Malaysians, we suggest that higher quantity of PUFA-rich food sources in regular diet may benefit overweight and obese Malaysian adults metabolically. Large-scale studies are required to replicate and confirm the current findings in the Malaysian population.
Weight loss is the cornerstone of NAFLD management, but weight maintenance is difficult. Some studies have suggested that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) might have beneficial effects in NAFLD. We aim to compare the effects of a low-energy diet with n-3 PUFA supplementation on liver enzymes, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in NAFLD.
The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in Urmia in Iran from October 2016 to May 2017. One hundred and fourteen eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of the three following groups: low-energy diet group, n-3 PUFA supplementation (fish oil) group (1500 mg/d), or control group for 12 weeks. Liver enzymes, lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body composition were assessed before and after the intervention.
One hundred and four patients completed the study. All groups lost weight, but the reductions were greater in the diet group (-2.97 ± 2.79 kg, P = 0.001). The diet group had significant decreases in fat mass compared to other groups. Insulin resistance, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased only in the diet group, and patients who lost weight ≥4% showed significantly larger decreases in serum liver enzymes. N-3 PUFA had no beneficial effects on the study outcomes.
We found that 1500 mg/d n-3 PUFA supplied for 12 weeks, in contrast to 3.40 ± 2.98% weight loss, does not improve liver enzymes, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors in NAFLD patients.
This study determined impacts of dietary methionine concentrations at two temperatures on growth, feeding efficiency and N-metabolites in juvenile cobia. Methionine concentrations of the experimental diets were deficient (M9; 9 g/kg), sufficient (M12; 12 g/kg) and surplus (M16, 16 g/kg). Water temperature was normal (30°C) or elevated (34°C). Twenty cobia in triplicate tanks were fed the experimental diets for 6 weeks. Both methionine and temperature affected cobia's growth and feeding efficiency. Cobia fed M9 performed lower than the fish fed M12 and M16 diets. Additionally, cobia reared at 34°C performed poorer than at 30°C, probably due to lower voluntary feed intake in the fish reared at 34°C. Protein efficiency ratio and protein productive value in cobia fed M9 diet were less than M12 or M16 diets. This was confirmed with the improved retentions of indispensable amino acids (AAs). No interactions between methionine and temperature were observed in growth and protein accretion. At 30°C, CF improved, while HSI and VSI declined upon methionine supplementation levels. Of which an interaction between temperature and methionine was present. Plasma, muscle and liver free AA and N-metabolites were affected by methionine and temperature. Furthermore, temperature affected cobia's lipid class composition, resulting in increased phospholipids and cholesterol at 34°C.
Bauhinia L. species, including Bauhinia holophylla (Bong.) Steud. (Fabaceae), have traditionally been used to treat diabetes. Bauhinia is a complex botanical genus, and the indiscriminate use of the diverse Bauhinia species is reflected in the experimental divergence of their medicinal potential.
The hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects, molecular mechanism of action and phytochemical properties of an authentic extract of B. holophylla leaves were evaluated.
A phytochemical study of a 70% EtOH extract was performed using FIA-ESI-IT-MS/MSn and HPLC-PAD-ESI-IT-MS. The extract (200 or 400 mg/kg b.w.) was administered for 14 days to streptozotocin-induced diabetic Swiss mice. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, blood parameters, gene and protein expression, and the in vivo and in vitro inhibition of intestinal glucosidases were assessed.
HPLC-PAD-ESI-IT-MS analysis identified flavonoid derivatives of quercetin, myricetin, luteolin and kaempferol. Treatment with 400 mg/kg of the extract reduced blood glucose (269.0 ± 32.4 mg/dL vs. 468.0 ± 32.2 mg/dL for diabetic animals), improved glucose tolerance, decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increased the mRNA expression of proteins involved in glucogenesis in the liver and muscle, such as PI3-K/Akt, GS, GSK3-β (ser-9), AMPK and Glut4. The activity of intestinal maltase was inhibited in vitro (IC50: 43.0 µg/mL for the extract compared to 516.4 µg/mL for acarbose) and in vivo.
Treatment with B. holophylla was associated with a marked hypoglycaemic effect through the stimulation of glycogenesis and inhibition of gluconeogenesis and intestinal glucose absorption, without increasing basal insulinaemia.
Recent studies have highlighted the correlation between diabetes and pancreatic fat infiltration. However, pancreatic fat content (PFC) is rarely confirmed by pathological results, and a change of PFC during progression of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is currently controversial.
To evaluate the relationship of MRI-pancreatic proton density fat fraction to serologic changes and histology in an experimental model of diabetes.
Prospective animal study.
Thirteen Bama pigs were randomly assigned to diabetes (n = 7) or control (n = 6) groups. Pigs in the diabetic group received high-fat/high-sugar feed, combined with three doses of streptozotocin injections.
3.0T, IDEAL-IQ sequence.
Starting in the fifth month, biochemical changes were evaluated; all pigs underwent axial MRI with the IDEAL-IQ sequence to measured pancreatic fat fraction (PFF). PFC was measured by the Soxhlet extraction method. Pancreatic fat distribution and pancreas islet morphology were observed by histopathology.
A Mann-Whitney U-test, independent-samples t-test, Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, single-measure intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were performed.
During the development of T2DM, the PFF, weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) of the experimental group showed an upward trend; fasting insulin (INS), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and HOMA-β showed decreasing trends. At the end of the fifteenth month, FBG (mmol/L) was 18.06 ± 6.03 and 5.06 ± 1.41 (P &lt; 0.001), PFF (%) was 36.52 ± 4.07 and 27.75 ± 3.73 (P = 0.002), INS (mU/L) was 21.59 ± 2.93 and 29.32 ± 3.27 (P = 0.001), HOMA-IR was 16.83 ± 4.22 and 6.70 ± 2.45 (P &lt; 0.001), HOMA-β was 1.50 ± 0.24 and 2.77 ± 0.45 (P &lt; 0.001), between the experimental and control groups. There were strong and moderate positive correlations between PFF and PFC (r = 0.968, P &lt; 0.001), and FBG (r = 0.657, P = 0.015), and HOMA-IR (r = 0.608, P = 0.028).
MRI-proton density fat fraction can measure the fat content of the pancreas with great accuracy and repeatability; PFF is a potential biomarker that can reflect the different stages of diabetes development.

Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in developed countries. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to investigate the effect of metformin on biomarkers associated with breast cancer outcomes and to explore the dose-response relationship.
A systematic search was performed from onset of the database to January 2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane library to identify randomized clinical trials investigating the impact of metformin on insulin, glucose, CRP, leptin, body mass indices (BMI), cholesterol, Ki-67, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin-Resistance (HOMA-IR). Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects models.
Nine studies providing 1,363 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed a significant reduction in insulin (WMD: - 0.99 U/ml, 95% CI - 1.66, - 0.33), glucose (WMD: - 1.78 ml/dl, 95% CI - 2.96, - 0.60), CRP (WMD: - 0.60 mg/l, 95% CI - 0.88, - 0.33), HOMA-IR (WMD: - 0.45, 95% CI - 0.77, - 0.11), leptin (WMD: - 2.44 ng/ml, 95% CI - 3.28, - 1.61), BMI (WMD: - 0.55 kg/m2, 95% CI - 1.00, - 0.11), and Ki-67 (WMD: - 4.06, 95% CI - 7.59, - 0.54). Results of the subgroup analyses showed that insulin, glucose, and BMI decreased more significantly when the duration of administering metformin intervention was above 4 weeks. We did not observe non-linear changes in the dose-response relationship between metformin and biomarkers as outcomes.
Breast cancer patients receiving metformin as treatment for diabetes showed significant reduction in levels of insulin, fasting glucose, CRP, HOMA, leptin, BMI, and Ki-67.
Tributyltin (TBT), an organotin chemical used as a catalyst and biocide, can stimulate cholesterol efflux in non-steroidogenic cells. Since cholesterol is the first limiting step for sex hormone production, we hypothesized that TBT disrupts intracellular cholesterol transport and impairs steroidogenesis in ovarian theca cells. We investigated TBT's effect on cholesterol trafficking, luteinization, and steroidogenesis in theca cells of five species (human, sheep, cow, pig, and mice). Primary theca cells were exposed to an environmentally relevant dose of TBT (1 or 10 ng/ml) and/or retinoid X receptor (RXR) antagonist. The expression of RXRα in sheep theca cells was knocked down using shRNA. Steroidogenic enzymes, cholesterol transport factors, and nuclear receptors were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, and intracellular cholesterol, progesterone, and testosterone secretion by ELISA. TBT upregulated StAR and ABCA1 in ovine cells, and SREBF1 mRNA in theca cells. TBT also reduced intracellular cholesterol and upregulated ABCA1 protein expression but did not alter testosterone or progesterone production. RXR antagonist and RXRα knockdown demonstrates that TBT's effect is partially through RXR. TBT's effect on ABCA1 and StAR expression was recapitulated in all five species. TBT, at an environmentally relevant dose, stimulates theca cell cholesterol extracellular efflux via the RXR pathway, triggers a compensatory upregulation of StAR that regulates cholesterol transfer into the mitochondria and SREBF1 for de novo cholesterol synthesis. Similar results were obtained in all five species evaluated (human, sheep, cow, pig, and mice) and are supportive of TBT's conserved mechanism of action across mammalian species.
Certain plant foods (nuts and soy protein) and food components (viscous fibers and plant sterols) have been permitted by the FDA to carry a heart health claim based on their cholesterol-lowering ability. The FDA is currently considering revoking the heart health claim for soy protein due to a perceived lack of consistent LDL cholesterol reduction in randomized controlled trials.
We performed a meta-analysis of the 46 controlled trials on which the FDA will base its decision to revoke the heart health claim for soy protein.
We included the 46 trials on adult men and women, with baseline circulating LDL cholesterol concentrations ranging from 110 to 201 mg/dL, as identified by the FDA, that studied the effects of soy protein on LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol (TC) compared with non-soy protein. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data. Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method with a random effects model and expressed as mean differences with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified.
Of the 46 trials identified by the FDA, 43 provided data for meta-analyses. Of these, 41 provided data for LDL cholesterol, and all 43 provided data for TC. Soy protein at a median dose of 25 g/d during a median follow-up of 6 wk decreased LDL cholesterol by 4.76 mg/dL (95% CI: -6.71, -2.80 mg/dL, P &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 55%, P &lt; 0.0001) and decreased TC by 6.41 mg/dL (95% CI: -9.30, -3.52 mg/dL, P &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 74%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared with non-soy protein controls. There was no dose-response effect or evidence of publication bias for either outcome. Inspection of the individual trial estimates indicated most trials (∼75%) showed a reduction in LDL cholesterol (range: -0.77 to -58.60 mg/dL), although only a minority of these were individually statistically significant.
Soy protein significantly reduced LDL cholesterol by approximately 3-4% in adults. Our data support the advice given to the general public internationally to increase plant protein intake. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03468127.
Household food insecurity (HFI) is a stressor that is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, little is known about HFI and the insulin resistance (IR) underlying T2D, and the mechanisms involved.
We examined the cross-sectional association between HFI and IR among low-income Latinos with T2D and tested whether inflammation and stress hormones mediated this association.
HFI was measured with the 6-item US Household Food Security Survey module. IR was calculated from fasting plasma blood glucose and serum insulin. Inflammation was indicated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and stress hormones included urinary cortisol, metanephrine, and normetanephrine. To test for an indirect effect of HFI on homeostasis model assessment of IR, a parallel multiple mediation model was run with biological markers that significantly differed between food security status-entered as mediators in the model. We used 95% bias-corrected bootstrap CIs, with 10,000 bootstrap samples, to assess the significance of the indirect effects.
The 121 participants with T2D were primarily Puerto Rican (85.8%), aged mean = 60.7 y, and 74% were female. Eighty-two (68%) were classified as food insecure. Compared with food-secure individuals, food-insecure individuals had a significantly higher IR [mean difference (Δ) = 7.21, P = 0.001], insulin (Δ = 9.7, P = 0.019), glucose (Δ = 41, P &lt; 0.001), hsCRP (Δ = 0.8, P = 0.008), cortisol (Δ = 21, P = 0.045), and total cholesterol (Δ = 29, P = 0.004). Groups did not differ on other lipids, metanephrine, normetanephrine, or A1c. The mediation model showed a significant direct effect of HFI on hsCRP (P = 0.020) and on cortisol (P = 0.011). There was a direct effect of cortisol (P = 0.013), hsCRP (P = 0.044), and HFI on IR (P = 0.015). The total combined indirect effect of HFI through cortisol and hsCRP indicated partial mediation.
Among Latinos with T2D, HFI is associated with IR partially through inflammation and stress hormones. Interventions to ameliorate HFI and mitigate its effects on inflammation, stress, and IR are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01578096.
Pinto beans contain multiple active agents such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and saponins, and have been shown to lower cholesterol, but the mechanisms involved in this effect have not been explored.
This study was to investigate the changes in cholesterol metabolism in response to whole pinto beans (wPB) and their hulls (hPB) supplemented into a diet rich in saturated fat and the molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for these effects in hamsters.
Forty-four 9-wk-old male Golden Syrian hamsters were randomly assigned to 4 diet groups (n = 11), including a 5% (wt:wt) fat diet [normal-fat diet (NF)], a 15% (wt:wt) fat diet [diet rich in saturated fat (HSF), saturated fatty acids accounted for 70% of total fatty acids], or HSF supplemented with 5% (wt:wt) wPB or 0.5% (wt:wt) hPB for 4 wk. Plasma, liver, intestinal, and fecal samples were collected to evaluate multiple cholesterol markers and gene targets.
The plasma non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) concentration was significantly reduced in the wPB- and hPB-supplemented groups by 31.9 ± 3.5% and 53.6 ± 3.2%, respectively, compared with the HSF group (P &lt; 0.01), to concentrations comparable with the NF group. The wPB-supplemented hamsters had significantly lower liver cholesterol (45.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and higher fecal cholesterol concentrations (94.8%, P = 0.001) than those fed the HSF. The expressions of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (Hmgcr) and small intestinal acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (Acat2) were significantly decreased in animals administered wPB (by 89.1% and 63.8%, respectively) and hPB (by 72.9% and 47.7%, respectively) compared with their HSF-fed counterparts (P &lt; 0.05). The wPB normalized the expression of Acat2 to the level of the NF group.
Pinto beans remediated high cholesterol induced by HSF in male hamsters by decreasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption, effects which were partially exerted by the hulls.
Caveolae and transverse (T-) tubules are membrane structures enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. They play an important role in receptor signalling and myogenesis. The T-system is also highly enriched in dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), which control excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. Recent results have shown that a depletion of membrane cholesterol alters caveolae and T-tubules, yet detailed functional studies of DHPR expression are lacking. Here we studied electrophysiological and morphological effects of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD), a cholesterol-sequestering drug, on freshly isolated fetal skeletal muscle cells. Exposure of fetal myofibres to 1-3 mM MbetaCD for 1 h at 37 degrees C led to a significant reduction in caveolae and T-tubule areas and to a decrease in cell membrane electrical capacitance. In whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, the L-type Ca(2+) current amplitude was significantly reduced, and its voltage dependence was shifted approximately 15 mV towards more positive potentials. Activation and inactivation kinetics were slower in treated cells than in control cells and stimulation by a saturating concentration of Bay K 8644 was enhanced. In addition, intramembrane charge movement and Ca(2+) transients evoked by a depolarization were reduced without a shift of the midpoint, indicating a weakening of E-C coupling. In contrast, T-type Ca(2+) current was not affected by MbetaCD treatment. Most of the L-type Ca(2+) conductance reduction and E-C coupling weakening could be explained by a decrease of the number of DHPRs due to the disruption of caveolae and T-tubules. However, the effects on L-type channel gating kinetics suggest that membrane cholesterol content modulates DHPR function. Moreover, the significant shift of the voltage dependence of L-type current without any change in the voltage dependence of charge movement and Ca(2+) transients suggests that cholesterol differentially regulates the two functions of the DHPR.
A series of taxoids (modified at the C-3'N position) have been used for the development of two QSAR models for their cytotoxic activities against macrophage (MPhi)-like cells J774.1 and J7.DEF3. QSAR results suggest that hydrophobic and steric features influence the inhibitory activity in a linear model. The ClogP values were not great enough to establish the upper limit of the inhibition. Internal [cross-validation, quality factor (Q), Fischer statistics (F), Y-randomization, and lack of overfitting tests] and external validation tests have validated both the QSAR models.
The aim of this analysis was to investigate the association between periodontal status and renal allograft function in a cohort of renal transplant patients using different periodontitis case definitions.
Fifty-eight kidney transplant patients were included. The subjects were classified into two groups, deterioration or stable/improvement of renal allograft function as expressed by the difference in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between two time points at least 6 months apart. Chronic periodontitis was defined as: (1) two or more interproximal sites with clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥4 mm or two or more interproximal sites with probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm (DEF1); (2) PD ≥ 5 or CAL ≥ 4 in at least six proximal sites (DEF2); and (3) PD ≥ 5 or CAL ≥ 4 in at least two proximal sites in each quadrant (DEF3).
In a multivariate linear regression model, none of the continuous periodontal variables were significantly associated with deterioration of allograft function. Of the three definitions of chronic periodontitis, only DEF2 emerged as significantly more prevalent in subjects with GFR deterioration and was a statistically significant predictor of GFR deterioration over time.
These findings underscore the importance of periodontitis ‘case definition’ in the observed statistical associations between periodontitis and systemic disease.
To propose a novel, three-level (severe, moderate, mild) case definition using probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) for epidemiologic studies on periodontitis.
Case definitions (DEF) 1-30 with PD, CAL and BOP were made. Based on data from epidemiologic research in Chengde (Hebei Province, China) in 1992, prevalence of periodontitis by DEF1-30 was calculated and compared with a reference (definitions by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology in 2012). Sensitivity, specificity, Youden Index, Cohen's kappa coefficient (CKC) and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated for the definitions selected.
DEF1 and DEF18 for periodontitis, DEF2, DEF3, DEF19 for moderate and severe periodontitis, and DEF5, DEF13, DEF14, DEF21 and DEF25 for severe periodontitis, which were similar for estimation of periodontitis prevalence compared with the reference, were selected. DEF18 for periodontitis, DEF19 for moderate and severe periodontitis, and DEF5 for severe periodontitis were selected because they showed higher values for the Youden Index, CKC and AUC, and formed a three-level definition.
A novel three-level case classification of periodontitis using three parameters of PD, CAL and BOP was proposed. The estimated periodontitis prevalence according to the novel proposed definition is close to the prevalence according to the CDC/AAP definition.
Periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) have osteogenic capacity, producing bone matrix proteins. Application of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) to PDLFs is a promising approach for periodontal regeneration. However, in chronic bone metabolic disorders, such as periodontitis, proper control of accompanying inflammation is essential for optimizing the effects of BMPs on PDLFs. We have previously shown that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), a medical technology that induces mechanical stress using sound waves, significantly promotes osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that LIPUS promotes the BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of PDLFs. In contrast, BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation was not altered by LIPUS, probably due to the LIPUS-induced secretion of Noggin, a BMP2 antagonist, from PDLFs. To examine if LIPUS affects inflammatory responses of PDLFs to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (LPS-PG), we also simultaneously treated PDLFs with LIPUS and LPS-PG. Treatment with LIPUS significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERKs, TANK-binding kinase 1, and interferon regulatory factor 3 in LPS-PG-stimulated PDLFs, in addition to inhibiting the degradation of IκB. Furthermore, LIPUS treatment reduced messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL10 and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, and also diminished IL-1ß and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa)-induced inflammatory reactions. Phosphorylation of Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1) was induced by LIPUS, while ROCK1-specific inhibitor prevented the promotive effects of LIPUS on p38 phosphorylation, mRNA expression of CXCL1 and Noggin, and osteogenesis. The suppressive effects of LIPUS on LPS-PG-stimulated inflammatory reactions were also prevented by ROCK1 inhibition. Moreover, LIPUS treatment blocked inhibitory effects of LPS-PG and IL-1ß on osteogenesis. These results indicate that LIPUS suppresses inflammatory effects of LPS-PG, IL-1ß, and TNFa and also promotes BMP9-induced osteogenesis through ROCK1 in PDLFs.
Objective: To investigate the role and mechanism of the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Methods: (1) The detection of NF-κB expression: parental (A2780) and paclitaxel-resistant (A2780/Taxol) ovarian carcinoma cells were divided into four groups, named A2780 group, A2780+cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197, HB-EGF inhibitor) group, A2780/Taxol group and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group. Among four groups, the expression level HB-EGF and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were examined by immunofluorescence double staining on confocal microscopy. Western blot was used to detect the expression level of NF-κB. In vivo, A2780 and A2780/Taxol cells were injected intraperitoneally to nude mouse to determine the expression level of NF-κB of the tumors from these four groups by immunohistochemistry method. (2) The detection on the function of NF-κB: A2780/Taxol cells were divided into four groups, named transfected with empty vector+saline group, NF-κB small interference RNA (siRNA)+saline group, empty vector+CRM197 group and NF-κB siRNA+CRM197 group respectively. Among four groups, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel, the expression level of plasma membrane glycoprotein (P-gp) and the effect of intracellular rhodomine123 (Rh123) accumulation were detected. Results: (1) The detection of NF-κB expression: the expression scores of HB-EGF protein among four groups were 5.6±1.3, 2.1±1.2, 11.7±3.5 and 6.2±1.4; the expression scores of EGFR protein were 5.1±1.6, 2.8±0.6, 10.4±3.1 and 5.6±1.9, respectively. The expression levels of NF-κB protein in the cells of the group named A2780, A2780+CRM197, A2780/Taxol and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group were 1.89±0.23, 0.74±0.12, 3.45±0.16 and 1.31±0.08, respectively; the expression scores of NF-κB protein in the tissue tumors from four groups were 3.3±1.1, 1.4±0.4, 8.7±2.3 and 3.6±1.2, respectively. The expression level of HB-EGF, EGFR and NF-κB protein between A2780 and A2780/Taxol groups in vivo and in vitro were higher than these in A2780+CRM197 and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group, while the expression level of HB-EGF, EGFR and NF-κB protein in A2780 group were lower than those in A2780/Taxol groups in vivo and in vitro (P&lt;0.05). (2) The examination of NF-κB function: the IC(50) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel in groups transfected with empty vector+saline, NF-κB siRNA+saline, empty vector+CRM197 and NF-κB siRNA+CRM197 group were respectively (39.4±0.8), (7.6±0.6), (6.7±0.5) and (4.2±0.4) μmol/L, while the expression levels of P-gp protein among four groups were respectively 3.11±0.23,1.45±0.16, 1.73±0.21 and 0.68±0.14, the cellular Rh123 accumulation among four groups were respectively 110±15, 246±19, 231±22 and 296±24. The expression levels of IC(50) and P-gp protein in groups transfected with NF-κB siRNA+saline, empty vector+CRM197 and NF-κB siRNA+CRM197 group were significantly higher than those in group transfected with empty vector+saline group (P&lt;0.01), while the cellular Rh123 accumulation among three groups were significantly lower than that in group transfected with empty vector+saline (P&lt;0.01). Conclusions: The expression of NF-κB may contributes to the paclitaxel resistance to ovarian cancer. HB-EGF may induce the paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer by the regulation of EGFR/NF-κB/P-gp pathway.

The gonadotropin-induced resumption of oocyte meiosis in preovulatory follicles is preceded by expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like peptides, amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG), in mural granulosa and cumulus cells. Both the gonadotropins and the EGF-like peptides possess the capacity to stimulate resumption of oocyte meiosis in vitro via activation of a broad signaling network in cumulus cells. To better understand the rapid genomic actions of gonadotropins (FSH) and EGF-like peptides, we analyzed transcriptomes of cumulus cells at 3 h after their stimulation.
We hybridized aRNA from cumulus cells to a pig oligonucleotide microarray and compared the transcriptomes of FSH- and AREG/EREG-stimulated cumulus cells with untreated control cells and vice versa. The identified over- and underexpressed genes were subjected to functional genomic analysis according to their molecular and cellular functions. The expression pattern of 50 selected genes with a known or potential function in ovarian development was verified by real-time qRT-PCR.
Both FSH and AREG/EREG increased the expression of genes associated with regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration, blood coagulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. FSH alone induced the expression of genes involved in inflammatory response and in the response to reactive oxygen species. Moreover, FSH stimulated the expression of genes closely related to some ovulatory events either exclusively or significantly more than AREG/EREG (AREG, ADAMTS1, HAS2, TNFAIP6, PLAUR, PLAT, and HSD17B7). In contrast to AREG/EREG, FSH also increased the expression of genes coding for key transcription factors (CEBPB, FOS, ID1/3, and NR5A2), which may contribute to the differing expression profiles of FSH- and AREG/EREG-treated cumulus cells.
The impact of FSH on cumulus cell gene transcription was higher than the impact of EGF-like factors in terms of the number of cell functions affected as well as the number of over- and underexpressed genes. Both FSH and EGF-like factors overexpressed genes involved in the post-ovulatory switch in steroidogenesis and tissue remodelling. However, FSH was remarkably more efficient in the up-regulation of several specific genes essential for ovulation of matured oocytes and also genes that been reported to play an important role in maturation of cumulus-enclosed oocytes in vitro.
The nr0b1 and nr5a2 genes, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, are strong candidate genes involved in gonadal differentiation in several vertebrate species. In this study, an nr0b1 complementary DNA (cDNA) of 1446 bp, which encodes a predicted 298 amino acid protein, and an nr5a2 cDNA of 2425 bp, which encodes a deduced 523 amino acid protein, were obtained from olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. Both genes were expressed in multiple organ tissues of adult flounder, with a higher expression in ovary than in testis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to investigate their temporal expression profiles in gonads during differentiation and at five development stages. Results indicated that nr0b1 and nr5a2 were expressed in primitive gonad and in the ensuing gonadal differentiation periods. In general, both genes were more highly expressed in ovary than in testis at all observed development stages. The expression level of cyp19a correlated with the nr5a2/nr0b1 ratio over the course of flounder gonadal differentiation; hence, nr0b1 and nr5a2 genes may be involved in flounder ovarian differentiation by regulating the expression of cyp19a.
The glucosyltransferase (GTF) and fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzymes play a pivotal role in dental biofilm formation as they synthesize polysaccharides that act as the extracellular matrix of the biofilm. Iodine is a unique antibacterial agent that has distinct properties from other conventional antibacterial agents. In this study we have examined the effect of iodine and povidone iodine (PI) on gtf and ftf expression in biofilm and planktonic environments and on immobilized and unbound GTF and FTF activity.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to investigate the effect of iodine and PI on ftf, gtfB and gtfC expression. The effect of iodine and PI on GTF and FTF activity was tested using radioactive assays.
Our results indicate that iodine and PI in a tetraglycol carrier cause enhancement of expression of gtfB in Streptococcus mutans in biofilms but not in planktonic bacteria. PI in water induced expression of gtfB and gtfC in planktonic bacteria. However, iodine and PI strongly inhibit polysaccharide production by GTF and to a lesser extent by FTF activity. The inhibitory effect on GTF activity was similar in solution compared to its activity in the immobilized environment. This unique effect may be attributed to the distinct chemical properties of iodine compared with other antibacterial agents.
This study indicates that iodine at sub-bactericidal concentrations demonstrates molecular and enzymatic effects that are highly associated with biofilm formation.
The extracellular enzyme fructosyltransferase (FTF) is considered to be a significant virulence factor in the dental biofilm. We have developed a method using surface plasmon resonance to detect the activity of immobilized FTF in situ. This real time technique provides a sensitive direct assay for characterizing functional properties of immobilized enzymes such as FTF.
Bacteria exposed to transient host environments can elicit adaptive responses by triggering the differential expression of genes via two-component signal transduction systems. This study describes the vicRK signal transduction system in Streptococcus mutans. A vicK (putative histidine kinase) deletion mutant (SmuvicK) was isolated. However, a vicR (putative response regulator) null mutation was apparently lethal, since the only transformants isolated after attempted mutagenesis overexpressed all three genes in the vicRKX operon (Smuvic+). Compared with the wild-type UA159 strain, both mutants formed aberrant biofilms. Moreover, the vicK mutant biofilm formed in sucrose-supplemented medium was easily detachable relative to that of the parent. The rate of total dextran formation by this mutant was remarkably reduced compared to the wild type, whereas it was increased in Smuvic+. Based on real-time PCR, Smuvic+ showed increased gtfBCD, gbpB, and ftf expression, while a recombinant VicR fusion protein was shown to bind the promoter regions of the gtfB, gtfC, and ftf genes. Also, transformation efficiency in the presence or absence of the S. mutans competence-stimulating peptide was altered for the vic mutants. In vivo studies conducted using SmuvicK in a specific-pathogen-free rat model resulted in significantly increased smooth-surface dental plaque (Pearson-Filon statistic [PF], &lt;0.001). While the absence of vicK did not alter the incidence of caries, a significant reduction in SmuvicK CFU counts was observed in plaque samples relative to that of the parent (PF, &lt;0.001). Taken together, these findings support involvement of the vicRK signal transduction system in regulating several important physiological processes in S. mutans.
Changes in the expression patterns of genes involved in bile acid (BA) synthesis were investigated during rat liver regeneration that follows two-thirds partial hepatectomy. BAs in bile were measured by GC-MS and the absolute and relative abundance of specific mRNAs in the liver by RT-real-time quantitative PCR. Cyclin E mRNA, used as an indicator of liver cell proliferation, peaked at day 1. The levels of mRNA of alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) were first reduced (day 1) and then (days 2-3) increased, when those of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) were also transiently enhanced. The early (day 1) up-regulation of Cyp7a1, and Cyp8b1, together with the down-regulation of Cyp27, was consistent with an increased proportion of cholic acid versus chenodeoxycholic acid and a progressive recovery in total BAs secretion. The transient appearance of flat BAs (allo-BAs plus Delta4-unsaturated-BAs) during rat liver regeneration was probably due to the changes in the expression ratio of steroid 5alpha- versus 5beta-reductase. Both were first (day 1) down-regulated and then up-regulated (5alpha-reductase more than 5beta-reductase). In conclusion, changes in the expression patterns of nuclear receptors and enzymes involved in BA synthesis are consistent with the transient modifications that occur in BA pool during rat liver regeneration.
Streptococcus mutans produces a fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzyme, which synthesizes fructan polymers from sucrose. Fructans contribute to the virulence of the biofilm by acting as binding sites for S. mutans adhesion and as extracellular nutrition reservoir for the oral bacteria. Antibodies raised against a recombinant S. mutans FTF were used to test the effect of glucose, fructose, and sucrose on FTF expression in S. mutans GS-5 biofilms. Biofilms formed in the presence of fructose and glucose showed a higher ratio of FTF compared to biofilms formed in the presence of sucrose. Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of S. mutans biofilms indicated a carbohydrate-dependent FTF distribution. The layer adjacent to the surface and those at the liquid interface displayed high amounts cell-free FTF with limited amount of bacteria while the in-between layers demonstrated both cell-free FTF and cells expressing cell-surface FTF. Biofilm of S. mutans grown on hydroxyapatite surfaces expressed several FTF bands with molecular masses of 160, 125, 120, 100, and 50 kDa, as detected by using FTF specific antibodies. The results show that FTF expression and distribution in S. mutans GS-5 biofilms is carbohydrate regulated.
Glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) and fructosyltransferase (Ftf), and the exopolysaccharides they produce, facilitate bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, and enhance the virulence of Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we used continuous chemostat cultures and reporter gene fusions to study the expression of ftf and gtfBC in response to carbohydrate availability and pH, and to asses the role of a protein similar to catabolite control protein A (CcpA), RegM, in regulation of these genes. Expression of ftf was efficient at pH 7.0 and 6.0, but was repressed at pH 5.0 under glucose-excess conditions. At pH 7.0, ftf expression was 5-fold lower under glucose-limiting conditions than in cells growing with an excess of glucose. Expression of gtfBC was also sensitive, albeit to a lesser extent, to pH and glucose availability. Inactivation of regM resulted in decreases of as much as 10-fold in both ftf and gtfBC expression, depending on growth conditions. These findings reinforce the importance of pH and carbohydrate availability for expression of two primary virulence attributes of S. mutans and reveal a critical role for RegM in regulation of expression of both gtfBC and ftf.
The expression of fructosyltransferase (FTF), the enzyme that synthesizes fructan from sucrose, is regulated in the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans. However, the exact mechanism of FTF regulation is unknown. In this study, the role of a two-component regulatory system (covRS) in FTF expression was investigated. A CovR-defective mutant of S. mutans NG8 was constructed by homologous recombination. By use of immunoblotting, the mutant was shown to overexpress FTF in the absence of sucrose, while the wild type and a covRS-complemented mutant showed sucrose-inducible FTF expression. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the ftf transcript levels were increased in the covR mutant, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. The covR mutant was also found to overproduce extracellular carbohydrate, and this phenotype was reversed by covRS complementation. Paper chromatographic studies and chemical tests showed that the extracellular carbohydrate contained glucose and glucuronic acid but not fructose. These results suggest that the extracellular carbohydrate was not fructan. The production of a glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing extracellular carbohydrate has not been reported for S. mutans and may be considered novel. In conclusion, the results indicate that the expression of FTF and a glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing carbohydrate was negatively regulated by the covRS two-component regulatory system in S. mutans.
Malaria is associated with excessive parasitic infection of the placenta and a reduction in neonatal birthweight. This study has investigated placental cell death in women with active and past malarial infection. Term placentae, with and without malarial pathology, were obtained from women in The Gambia. Active and past malaria infections were identified in placental sections and histological examination was used to determine the number of villi, the incidence of apoptosis, syncytial degradation, fibrinoid deposition and the frequency of syncytial knots. Placentae with active malaria infection showed erythrocyte adhesion of infected cells to syncytiotrophoblast, syncytial degradation, increased syncytial knotting and, in rare cases, localized destruction of the villi. Past malarial infection was characterized by syncytiotrophoblast disruption and fibrin-type fibrinoid (FTF) deposition. Perivillous FTF deposition was consistent with increased syncytial lesions and both increased lesions and syncytial knots were associated with birthweight reductions. Active malaria infection produced no alteration in placental apoptosis. The numbers of chorionic villi remained unchanged and infiltration of inflammatory cells, although not measured directly, appeared to be non-pervasive within the infected tissue. These observations establish a direct link between malaria parasitic infection and syncytiotrophoblast damage. The placental rejection of parasite-affected syncytia may invoke structural changes to compensate for inadequate placental exchange. Syncytial destruction could have serious implications; impairing fetal growth and in some rare cases, providing a previously unrecognized pathway to congenital infection.
Streptococcus mutans utilizes sucrose to synthesize glucans by glucosyltransferase and fructans by fructosyltransferase (FTF). Antibodies raised against a recombinant FTF were used to study S. mutans FTF secretion. Low amounts of cell-free FTF were found in culture of S. mutans grown with sucrose, while an increase in bacteria displaying cell surface FTF was detected. FTF added to S. mutans cultures was adsorbed to bacteria grown with sucrose but not to bacteria grown with glucose or fructose or to a gtf inactivated mutant grown with sucrose. Recombinant FTF was found to have high affinity for glucans suggesting that fructans and glucans are an integral part of the polysaccharide matrix of oral biofilms.
Lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (FTF) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2--&gt;6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. Purification of this FTF (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first Lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (Lev) consisting of 804 amino acids. Lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of L. reuteri 121 [Inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2--&gt;1)-linked fructosyl units] and with FTFs from streptococci. Expression of lev in Escherichia coli resulted in an active FTF (Lev Delta 773His) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2--&gt;1--&gt;6) branching points] as L. reuteri 121 cells grown on raffinose. The low degree of branching of the L. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of Streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. Although Lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. Lev is strongly dependent on Ca(2+) ions for activity. Unique properties of L. reuteri Lev together with Inu are: (i) the presence of a C-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in Escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for FTF enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees C, kinetics that are best described by the Hill equation.
Bacterial fructosyltransferases (FTFs) are retaining-type glycosidases that belong to family 68 of glycoside hydrolases. Recently, the high-resolution 3D structure of the Bacillus subtilis levansucrase has been solved [Meng, G. and Futterer, K., Nat. Struct. Biol. 10 (2003) 935-941]. Based on this structure, the catalytic nucleophile, general acid/base catalyst, and transition state stabilizer were identified. However, a detailed characterization of site-directed mutants of the catalytic nucleophile has not been presented for any FTF enzyme. We have constructed site-directed mutants of the three putative catalytic residues of the Lactobacillus reuteri 121 levansucrase and inulosucrase and characterized the mutant proteins. Changing the putative catalytic nucleophiles D272 (inulosucrase) and D249 (levansucrase) into their amido counterparts resulted in a 1.5-4x10(5) times reduction of total sucrase activity.
The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the major sugar uptake system in oral streptococci. The role of EIIAB(Man) (encoded by manL) in gene regulation and sugar transport was investigated in Streptococcus mutans UA159. The manL knockout strain, JAM1, grew more slowly than the wild-type strain in glucose but grew faster in mannose and did not display diauxic growth, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is involved in sugar uptake and in carbohydrate catabolite repression. PTS assays of JAM1, and of strains lacking the inducible (fruI) and constitutive (fruCD) EII fructose, revealed that S. mutans EIIAB(Man) transported mannose and glucose and provided evidence that there was also a mannose-inducible or glucose-repressible mannose PTS. Additionally, there appears to be a fructose PTS that is different than FruI and FruCD. To determine whether EIIAB(Man) controlled expression of the known virulence genes, glucosyltransferases (gtfBC) and fructosyltransferase (ftf) promoter fusions of these genes were established in the wild-type and EIIAB(Man)-deficient strains. In the manL mutant, the level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the gtfBC promoter was up to threefold lower than that seen with the wild-type strain at pH 6 and 7, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is required for optimal expression of gtfBC. No significant differences were observed between the mutant and the wild-type background in ftf regulation, with the exception that under glucose-limiting conditions at pH 7, the mutant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in ftf expression. Two-dimensional gel analysis of batch-grown cells of the EIIAB(Man)-deficient strain indicated that the expression of at least 38 proteins was altered compared to that seen with the wild-type strain, revealing that EIIAB(Man) has a pleiotropic effect on gene expression.
Mrp3(Abcc3) is markedly induced following bile duct ligation (BDL) in the rat and in some human cholestatic liver diseases and is believed to ameliorate liver injury in this setting. Recently, the orphan nuclear receptor fetoprotein transcription factor/cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase promoter factor (CPF/FTF/Lrh-1) has been shown to activate Mrp3 expression. However, whether inflammatory cytokines or elevated bile acid levels increased Lrh-1/Mrp3 expression in obstructive cholestasis was not known. We hypothesized that induction of Mrp3 would be associated with Lrh-1 up-regulation and would require intact cytokine signaling. Male tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) receptor I (Tnfr-/-) mice and C57BLJ wild type (WT) controls were subjected to sham surgery or bile duct ligation. HepG2 cells were treated with bile acids or cytokines. Immunoblot assay and real time reverse transcriptase-PCR were used to determine expression of MRP3/Mrp3, CPF/Lrh-1, Mrp2, and Bsep. CPF/Lrh-1 DNA binding to the MRP3/Mrp3 promoter was assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and promoter activity was determined by luciferase assay. Total bile acids and lactate dehydrogenase were measured using colorimetric assays, and cytokine abundance was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lrh-1 and Mrp3 were significantly induced after BDL in WT but not Tnfr-/- mice. This was associated with more severe hepatocellular necrosis in Tnfr-/- mice. Lrh-1 binding to the Mrp3 promoter increased after BDL in WT but not in Tnfr-/- mice. Tnfalpha treatment of HepG2 cells also up-regulated CPF and MRP3, increased CPF binding to the MRP3 promoter, and up-regulated MRP3 promoter activity. These results indicate that induction of Mrp3 after BDL is due to Tnfalpha-dependent up-regulation of Lrh-1. They provide strong evidence that induction of Mrp3 plays a significant role in hepatocyte protection during obstructive cholestasis.
Fushi tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) genes belong to the nuclear receptor family 5A (NR5A). The distribution pattern of NR5A genes in teleosts suggests that they control functions separate to, or in addition to, those of other vertebrates. In mammals NR5A1 genes, including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), are primarily involved in steroidogenesis. NR5A2 contain the alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) genes, which protect mammalian embryos against maternal estrogens, and are involved in cholesterol transfer and metabolism. In this study we have analysed the expression of two Arctic char FTZ-F1 forms belonging to the NR5A2 group. The expression starts during early development and the transcripts are present in embryonic liver/pancreas and gonadal regions. The genes are up-regulated during embryogenesis as the embryo develops towards hatch, as shown by increased mRNA and protein levels. In adult Arctic char the FTZ-F1 forms are primarily located to tissues involved in steroidogenesis as well as cholesterol metabolism. Thus, a division of NR5A into SF-1 (NR5A1) and FTF (NR5A2) specific functions does not appear to have occurred in teleosts.
Fructosyltransferases (FTFs) are extracellular enzymes which synthesize fructans from sucrose. Cell free FTFs are found in the dental plaque biofilm as well as in saliva. Fructans play an important role in the progression of dental caries, mainly by serving as an extracellular nutrition reservoir for bacteria. The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of several antiplaque agents on the synthesis of fructans by FTF immobilized on hydroxyapatite (HA) or in solution. The effect of chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, sodium lauryl sulfate and Tween on FTF activity was tested using radioactive assays. Their effect on fructan structure was tested using circular dichrosim-optical rotative dispersion (CD-ORD) analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Our results show that the antiplaque agents tested had an inhibitory effect on FTF activity both in the immobilized phase and in solution, although the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in solution. Structural changes in fructans, due to the presence of the antiplque agents, were recorded as additional C-H or O-H bands demonstrated in FT-IR analysis. However, non-significant changes in peak location were detected in CD-ORD spectrum between fructans synthesized in solution and on HA surfaces, and after treatment with the different antiplaque agents. Our study shows that several antiplaque agents may affect FTF activity and the synthesis of fructans by FTF, immobilized on hydroxyapatite or in solution.
Although streptococcal and S. aureus IE share the same primary site of infection, their pathogenesis and clinical evolution present several major differences. Streptococci adhere to cardiac valves with pre-existing endothelial lesions. In contrast, S. aureus can colonize either damaged endothelium or invade physically intact endothelial cells. These interactions are mediated by multiple surface adhesins, some of which have been only partially characterized. Streptococci produce surface glucans (gtf and ftf), ECM adhesins (e.g., fibronectin-binding proteins, FimA), and platelet aggregating factors (phase I and phase II antigens, pblA, pblB, and pblT), all of which have been.
The sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) is a key enzyme of the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. It regulates the composition of bile acids in bile, i.e. ratio between cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). In similarity with cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), this enzyme is subjected to a negative feedback regulation by bile acids. It has been recently reported that bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) induces the small heterodimer partner (SHP) that interacts with alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and down-regulates CYP7A1 transcription. We studied whether the same mechanism also regulated rat CYP8B1 gene transcription. Feeding rats with CDCA caused a 40-50% decrease of CYP8B1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) mRNA expression levels. This was associated with an increase in FTF mRNA expression, but SHP mRNA expression was not altered. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and transient transfection assay of promoter/reporter genes coupled to mutagenesis analysis identified a putative bile acid response element (BARE) that has an HNF4alpha binding site embedded in two overlapping FTF binding sites. Mutation of the HNF4alpha binding site markedly reduced basal promoter activity and its repression by bile acids. Cotransfection with FTF strongly repressed CYP8B1 transcription. Interestingly, HNF4alpha could overcome the inhibitory effects of FTF and bile acids. We conclude that FTF and HNF4alpha not only play critical roles on CYP8B1 gene transcription, but also mediate bile acid feedback inhibition. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which bile acids inhibit rat CYP8B1 gene transcription by inducing FTF and inhibiting HNF4alpha expression.
We tested the effect of several carbohydrates on the activity of cell-free fructosyltransferases (FTF) in solution and immobilized onto hydroxyapatite (HA) and found an inhibitory dose-dependent effect of glucose on FTF activity, both on the surface and in solution. Glucose at 160 mM inhibits FTF activity by 75% both on HA and in solution. Fructose at 160 mM inhibited FTF activity by 25% in solution and by 15% on HA. Levan inhibited FTF activity by 30% in solution, while dextrans and inulin had a limited effect on FTF activity. Circular dichroism and infrared analysis demonstrated no major changes in the chemical structure of fructans synthesized by cell-free FTF on HA and in solution, in the presence or absence of glucose. However, as verified by size-exclusion chromatography, glucose inhibited the synthesis of high molecular-weight fructans. The results indicate that glucose, a byproduct of the FTF enzymatic reaction, is the main carbohydrate affecting FTF activity. Selective inhibition of high molecular-weight fructan production by glucose, may indicate that two mechanisms are involved in the synthesis of fructans, both in solution and on the surface.
The most important pathway for the catabolism and excretion of cholesterol in mammals is the formation of bile acids. Improper regulation of this pathway has implications for atherosclerosis, cholesterol gallstone formation, and some lipid storage diseases. Sterol 12 alpha-hydroxylase (12 alpha-hydroxylase) is required for cholic acid biosynthesis. The alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor FTF is crucial for the expression and the bile acid-mediated down-regulation of 12 alpha-hydroxylase. Cholesterol, on the other hand, down-regulates expression of the 12 alpha-hydroxylase gene. In this study, we show that the two sterol regulatory binding proteins (SREBPs) have opposite effects on the 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter. SREBP-1 activated the 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter, as it does with many other cholesterol-regulated genes. In contrast, SREBP-2 suppressed 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. SREBP-1 mediates the cholesterol-down-regulation of 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter by binding to two inverted sterol regulatory elements found approximately 300 nucleotides from the transcriptional initiation site. SREBP-2 mediated suppression of 12 alpha-hydroxylase without binding to its promoter. Data are presented suggesting that SREBP-2 suppresses the 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter by interacting with FTF. This is the first report of a promoter responding oppositely to two members of the SREBP family of transcription factors. These studies provide a novel function and mode of action of a SREBP protein.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor worldwide for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Integrated HBV DNA fragments, often highly rearranged, are frequently detected in HCC. In woodchuck, the viral enhancer plays a central role in hepatocarcinogenesis, but in humans the mechanism of HBV oncogenesis has not been established. In this study we investigated the status of the viral enhancer in two human HCC cell lines, Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 each containing one or more integrated HBV DNA fragments. Active enhancer was defined by virtue of its protein occupancy as determined by genomic in vivo DMS footprinting. In PLC/PRF/5 cells, the HBV DNA was integrated in a cellular gene at chromosome 11q13, at a locus reported to be amplified in many tumors. We show here that in both cell lines, the integrated HBV DNA fragments contain an active enhancer-I. In particular, the occupation of the two previously defined basic enhancer elements, E and EP, was prominent. While in both cell lines the same protein binds to the EP elements, the E element, however, is occupied in a cell-line specific manner. In PLC/PRF/5 but not Hep3B, the prominent binding of an undefined protein was detected. Our data suggest that this protein is likely to be the fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF). The finding that enhancer sequences are conserved and functional in different cell lines suggests a selection pressure for their long-term maintenance. We therefore propose that the HBV enhancer-I might play a role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
The enterohepatic circulation is essential for the maintenance of bile acids and cholesterol homeostasis. The ileal bile acid transporter on the apical membrane of enterocytes mediates the intestinal uptake of bile salts, but little is known about the bile salt secretion from the basolateral membrane of enterocytes into blood. In the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), is expressed, which has the ability to transport bile salts. We hypothesized that MRP3 might play a role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts by transporting them from enterocytes into circulating blood through the up-regulation of MRP3 expression, so we investigated the transcriptional control of MRP3 in response to bile salts. MRP3 mRNA levels were increased about 3-fold in human colon cells by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the promoter assay, the promoter activity of MRP3 was increased about 3-fold over the basal promoter activity when treated with CDCA, and the putative bile salt-responsive elements exist in the region -229/-138 including two alpha-1 fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF)-like elements. Constructs with a specific mutation in the consensus sequence of FTF elements showed no increase in basal transcriptional activity following CDCA treatment. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts, specific binding of FTF to FTF-like elements was observed when treated with CDCA. The expression of FTF mRNA levels were also markedly enhanced in response to CDCA, and overexpression of FTF specifically activated the MRP3 promoter activity about 4-fold over the basal promoter activity. FTF thus might play a key role not only in the bile salt synthetic pathway in hepatocytes but also in the bile salt excretion pathway in enterocytes through the regulation of MRP3 expression. MRP3 may contribute as a plausible bile salt-exporting transporter to the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts.
Streptococcus mutans produces a number of extracellular sucrose-metabolizing enzymes that contribute to the ability of the organism to cause dental caries, including three glucosyltransferases, the products of the gtfB, gtfC and gtfD genes, and a fructosyltransferase, encoded by the ftf gene. To better understand the regulation of the expression of these genes under environmental conditions that more closely mimic those in dental plaque, two strains of S. mutans harbouring fusions of the gtfBC (SMS102) and ftf (SMS101) promoters to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were examined in biofilms formed in vitro. The strains were grown in a Rototorque biofilm reactor in a tryptone-yeast extract-sucrose medium. CAT specific activity in biofilm cells was measured at quasi-steady state or following additions of 25 mM sucrose or glucose, with or without pH control. After approximately 10 generations of biofilm growth, the ftf and gtfBC genes of S. mutans were found to be expressed at levels different from those reported for planktonic cells growing under otherwise similar conditions. The expression of these genes was induced by the addition of sucrose to the quasi-steady-state cultures. Expression of the gtfBC genes was influenced by environmental pH, since CAT specific activities in quasi-steady-state biofilms of strain SMS102 grown without pH control were twice those produced by cells grown with pH control. Moreover, addition of glucose to quasi-steady-state biofilms resulted in increased expression of the gtfBC-cat fusion, although the magnitude of the induction was less than that seen with sucrose. The effect of pH on ftf expression was negligible. A modest and transient induction of ftf was observed in biofilms pulsed with excess glucose and the kinetics and level of induction of ftf by excess carbohydrate were dependent on the pH of the biofilms. This study demonstrates that the type and amount of carbohydrate and the environmental pH have a major influence on transcription of the gtfBC and ftf genes when the organisms are growing in biofilms, and provides evidence for previously undisclosed regulatory circuits for exopolysaccharide gene expression in S. mutans.
Cholesterol conversion to bile acids is subject to a feedback regulatory mechanism by which bile acids down-regulate their own synthesis. This regulation occurs at the level of transcription of several genes encoding enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. One of these enzymes is sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12alpha-hydroxylase), the specific enzyme required for cholic acid synthesis. The levels of this enzyme determine the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool. Previous studies from this laboratory showed that fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is required for 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. Here, we report that the short heterodimer partner (SHP) suppresses 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity via an interaction with FTF. Hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) binds and activates the 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter and is required for 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. Although HNF-4 interacts with SHP, it is not involved in SHP-mediated suppression of 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. FTF and not HNF-4 is the factor involved in regulation of 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity by bile acids through its interaction with SHP. Finally, interaction of SHP with FTF displaces FTF binding to its sites within the 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter. These results provide insights into the mechanism of action of bile acid-mediated regulation of sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase transcription.
The ability of Actinomyces naeslundii to convert sucrose to extracellular homopolymers of fructose and to catabolize these types of polymers is suspected to be a virulence trait that contributes to the initiation and progression of dental caries and periodontal diseases. Previously, we reported on the isolation and characterization of the gene, ftf, encoding the fructosyltransferase (FTF) of A. naeslundii WVU45. Allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to inactivate ftf, revealing that FTF-deficient stains were completely devoid of the capacity to produce levan-type (beta2,6-linked) polysaccharides. A polyclonal antibody was raised to a histidine-tagged, purified A. naeslundii FTF, and the antibody was used to localize the enzyme in the supernatant fluid. A sensitive technique was developed to detect levan formation by proteins that had been separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the method was used to confirm that the levan-synthesizing activity of A. naeslundii existed predominantly in a cell-free form, that a small amount of the activity was cell associated, and that the ftf mutant was unable to produce levans. By using the nucleotide sequence of the levanase gene of a genospecies 2 A. naeslundii, formerly Actinomyces viscosus, a portion of a homologue of this gene (levJ) was amplified by PCR and inserted into a suicide vector, and the resulting construct was used to inactivate the levJ gene in the genospecies 1 strain WVU45. A variety of physiologic and biochemical studies were performed on the wild-type and LevJ-deficient strains to demonstrate that (i) this enzyme was the dominant levanase and sucrase of A. naeslundii; (ii) that LevJ was inducible by growth in sucrose; (iii) that the LevJ activity was found predominantly (&gt;90%) in a cell-associated form; and (iv) that there was a second, fructose-inducible fructan hydrolase activity produced by these strains. The data provide the first detailed molecular analysis of fructan production and catabolism in this abundant and important oral bacterium.
Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is an orphan nuclear receptor that activates the alpha(1)-fetoprotein gene during early liver developmental growth. Here we sought to define better the position of FTF in transcriptional cascades leading to hepatic differentiation. The mouse FTF gene was isolated and assigned to chromosome 1 band E4 (one mFTF pseudogene was also found). Exon/intron mapping shows an mFTF gene structure similar to that of its close homologue SF1, with two more N-terminal exons in the mFTF gene; exon mapping also delimits several FTF mRNA 5'- and 3'-splice variants. The mFTF transcription initiation site was located in adult liver at 238 nucleotides from the first translation initiator codon, with six canonical GATA, E box, and Nkx motifs clustered between -50/-140 base pairs (bp) from the cap site; DNA/protein binding assays also pinpointed an HNF4-binding element at +36 bp and an FTF-binding element at -257 bp. Transfection assays and point mutations showed that the mFTF promoter is activated by GATA, HNF4alpha, FTF, Nkx, and basic helix-loop-helix factors, with marked cooperativity between GATA and HNF4alpha. A tandem GATA/E box activatory motif in the proximal mFTF promoter is strikingly similar to a composite motif coactivated by differentiation inducers in the hematopoietic lineage; a tandem GATA-Nkx motif in the distal mFTF promoter is also similar to a composite motif transducing differentiation signals from transforming growth factor-beta-like receptors in the cardiogenic lineage. Three genes encoding transcription factors critical to early hepatic differentiation, Hnf3beta, Hnf4alpha, and Hnf1alpha, each contain dual FTF-binding elements in their proximal promoters, and all three promoters are activated by FTF in transfection assays. Direct DNA binding action and cooperativity was demonstrated between FTF and HNF3beta on the Hnf3beta promoter and between FTF and HNF4alpha on the Hnf1alpha promoter. These combined results suggest that FTF is an early intermediary between endodermal specification signals and downstream genes that establish and amplify the hepatic phenotype.
We present a stereological method for testing whether or not there is random deposition of fibrin-type fibrinoid (FTF) at the villous surface of human placenta. The method requires random sampling of tissue with test lattice lines superimposed on microscopic fields at random positions and orientations. Test lines are used to generate chance intersections with specified sub-domains of the villous surface. At least three sub-domains are distinguishable: non-syncytial knots (nonSK), syncytial knots (SK) and areas of trophoblast de-epithelialization (DEP). Other sub-domains may be included to suit individual circumstances and project aims. The relative numbers of intersections with sub-domains provide the basis for an 'expected' distribution. Subsequently, this is compared with an 'observed' distribution which can be calculated from empirical estimates of the numbers of intersections with sub-domains associated with perivillous FTF (e.g. nonSK+FTF, SK+FTF and DEP+FTF). Expected and observed distributions can be compared by a chi-squared analysis. If the null hypothesis (no difference) is rejected, chi-squared values for individual sub-domains can be analysed in order to localize and interpret sites of preferential deposition. Comparisons may be drawn for individual placentae as well as a group of placentae, thereby permitting assessment of inter-placental variability. Finally, between-group comparisons may be drawn in order to test whether or not FTF deposition patterns differ in control and other pregnancies. Worked examples of the statistical procedures are provided. Preliminary results of applications to placentae from normal and complicated (hypobaric hypoxia) pregnancies are presented. They show that FTF deposition is non-random and preferentially located at sites of de-epithelialization. De-epithelialization may be a consequence of syncytial degeneration but also, at least in part, of continuous trophoblast turnover in which syncytial fragments rich in (pre-) apoptotic nuclei detach from the epithelium and are deported from the maternal intervillous space. The nascent detachment site is immediately covered by FTF prior to repair by re-epithelialization.
Oral actinomycetes produce fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzymes which convert sucrose into polymers of D-fructose, known as levans, and these polymers are thought to contribute to the persistence and virulence of the organisms. A gene encoding FTF was isolated from Actinomyces naeslundii WVU45; the deduced amino acid sequence showed significant similarity to known levansucrases of gram-negative environmental isolates but was less similar to FTFs from gram-positive bacteria. A transcriptional start site was mapped by primer extension 70 bp 5' from the putative start codon. Promoter fusions to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were used to confirm that there was a functional promoter driving ftf expression and to show that sequences located 86 to 218 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site were required for optimal ftf expression. Quantitative slot blot analysis against total RNA from cells grown on different sugars or from different growth phases revealed that ftf was constitutively transcribed. Thus, the A. naeslundii FTF is more similar in primary sequence and the regulation of expression to levansucrases of gram-negative bacteria than gram-positive bacteria.
Cholesterol conversion to bile acids occurs via the "classic" (neutral) or the "alternative" (acidic) bile acid biosynthesis pathways. Sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase/CYP8b1 is the specific enzyme required for cholic acid synthesis. The levels of this enzyme determine the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool. Expression of the 12alpha-hydroxylase gene is tightly down-regulated by hydrophobic bile acids. In this study, we report the characterization of two DNA elements that are required for both the 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. Mutation of these elements suppresses 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. Mutations of any other part of the promoter do not alter substantially the promoter activity or alter regulation by bile acids relative to the wild type promoter. These two DNA elements bind alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), a member of the nuclear receptor family. We also show that overexpression of FTF in a non-liver cell line activates the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter. These studies demonstrate the crucial role of FTF for the expression and regulation of a critical gene in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) enhancer II (EnII) is a hepatotropic cis element which is responsible for the hepatocyte-specific gene expression of HBV. Multiple transcription factors have been demonstrated to interact with this region. In this study, the region from HBV nucleotides (nt) 1640 to 1663 in EnII was demonstrated to be essential for enhancer activity and to be another target sequence of putative transcription factors. To elucidate the factors which bind to this region, we used a yeast one-hybrid screening system and cloned three transcription factors, HLF, FTF, and E4BP4, from a human adult liver cDNA library. All of these factors had binding affinity to the sequence from nt 1640 to 1663. Investigation of the effects of these factors on transcriptional regulation revealed that HLF and FTF had stimulatory activity on nt 1640 to 1663, whereas E4BP4 had a suppressing effect. FTF coordinately activated both 3. 5-kb RNA and 2.4/2.1-kb RNA transcription in a transient transfection assay with an HBV expression vector. HLF, however, activated only 3.5-kb RNA transcription, and in primer extension analysis, HLF strongly stimulated the synthesis of pregenome RNA compared to precore RNA. Thus, FTF stimulated the activity of the second enhancer, while HLF stimulated the activity of the core upstream regulatory sequence, which affects only the core promoter, and had a dominant effect on the pregenome RNA synthesis.
To examine the association between neurodevelopmental problems and high HbA1c among paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes.
A population-based study was performed among patients with type 1 diabetes (5-16 years) in two Swedish counties (n = 233). The Five to Fifteen (FTF) questionnaire targeted neurodevelopmental qualities. Scores above the 90th percentile in the various domains are considered as definitive problems and scores above the 75th percentile as mild. FTF scores were compared with regard to HbA1c ≤73 mmol/mol and &gt;73 mmol/mol (8.0%).
The response rate was 190 (82%). Neurodevelopmental problems were not overrepresented among patients in general. Memory and learning problems were associated with HbA1c &gt;73 mmol/mol (p = 0.01). This correlation was especially seen in adolescents (12-16 years) where mild executive problems (adjOR 3.1), definite memory problems (adjOR 5.0) and definite learning problems (adjOR 5.0) were associated with HbA1c &gt;73 mmol/mol after adjustment for gender, diabetes duration and age of onset.
Our findings that high HbA1c is more common in adolescent diabetes patients with neurodevelopmental problems generate the hypothesis that these problems might precede poor metabolic control. If so, early detection of neurodevelopmental problems would allow individually tailored treatment that may improve metabolic control and prevent complications.
Streptococcus mutans is recognised as a major aetiological agent of dental caries. One of its important virulence factors is its ability to form biofilms on tooth surfaces. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the quorum sensing inhibitor furanone C-30 on biofilm formation by S. mutans and its luxS mutant strain. The effects of furanone C-30 on biofilms of both strains formed on 96-well microtitre plates at 37 °C were determined by a colorimetric technique (MTT assay). Different concentrations of furanone C-30 (0.0, 2.0 and 4.0 μg/mL) and different time points of biofilm formation (4, 14 and 24 h) were investigated. The structures and thickness of the biofilms were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Quorum sensing-related gene expression (ftf, smu630, brpA, gbpB, gtfB, vicR, comDE and relA) was investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that synthetic furanone C-30 can inhibit biofilm formation by S. mutans and its luxS mutant strain, although it does not affect the bacterial growth rate itself. The quantities of biofilm formed by both strains significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) and the biofilms became thinner and looser as revealed by CLSM with increasing concentrations of furanone C-30. Expression of the genes tested was downregulated in the biofilms by the addition of furanone C-30. These results revealed that synthetic furanone C-30 can effectively inhibit biofilm formation by S. mutans and its luxS mutant strain.
In Streptococcus mutans, both competence and bacteriocin production are controlled by ComC and the ComED two-component signal transduction system. Recent studies of S. mutans suggested that purified ComE binds to two 11-bp direct repeats in the nlmC-comC promoter region, where ComE activates nlmC and represses comC. In this work, quantitative binding studies and DNase I footprinting analysis were performed to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant and further characterize the binding site of ComE. We found that ComE protects sequences inclusive of both direct repeats, has an equilibrium dissociation constant in the nanomolar range, and binds to these two direct repeats cooperatively. Furthermore, similar direct repeats were found upstream of cslAB, comED, comX, ftf, vicRKX, gtfD, gtfB, gtfC, and gbpB. Quantitative binding studies were performed on each of these sequences and showed that only cslAB has a similar specificity and high affinity for ComE as that seen with the upstream region of comC. A mutational analysis of the binding sequences showed that ComE does not require both repeats to bind DNA with high affinity, suggesting that single site sequences in the genome may be targets for ComE-mediated regulation. Based on the mutational analysis and DNase I footprinting analysis, we propose a consensus ComE binding site, TCBTAAAYSGT.
Streptococcus mutans is a major cariogenic bacterium. It has adapted to the biofilm lifestyle, which is essential for pathogenesis of dental caries. We aimed to identify small molecules that can inhibit cariogenic S. mutans and to discover lead structures that could give rise to therapeutics for dental caries. In this study, we screened a focused small-molecule library of 506 compounds. Eight small molecules which inhibited S. mutans at a concentration of 4 μM or less but did not affect cell growth or biofilm formation of commensal bacteria, represented by Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii, in monospecies biofilms were identified. The active compounds share similar structural properties, which are characterized by a 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) or 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-ABI) subunit. In multispecies biofilm models, the most active compound also inhibited cell survival and biofilm formation of S. mutans but did not affect commensal streptococci. This inhibitor downregulated the expression of six biofilm-associated genes, ftf, pac, relA, comDE, gbpB, and gtfB, in planktonic S. mutans cells, while it downregulated the expression of only ftf, pac, and relA in the biofilm cells of S. mutans. The most potent compound also inhibited production of two key adhesins of S. mutans, antigen I/II and glucosyltransferase (GTF). However, the compound did not alter the expression of the corresponding genes in both S. sanguinis and S. gordonii, indicating that it possesses a selective inhibitory activity against S. mutans.
Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) monitoring is an integral component of diabetes management. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the A1CNow® SELFCHECK device when used by lay users and health care professionals (HCPs) to measure A1C.
Subjects performed two A1CNow SELFCHECK finger-stick self-tests followed by a finger-stick test of the subject's blood by a HCP. The primary endpoint assessed accuracy of the subject and HCP A1CNow SELFCHECK readings. Secondary endpoints included precision, comprehension of instructional material (written material±DVD), and product satisfaction. For accuracy comparison, a venous blood sample was drawn from each subject and tested by laboratory (TOSOH) analysis. Subject comprehension of product instructional material was evaluated via first-time failure (FTF) rate as recorded by the HCP, and subject satisfaction was assessed through written survey.
A total of 110 subjects with (n=93) and without (n=17) diabetes participated. Of 177 subject A1C values, 165 (93.2%) were within the acceptable range of ±13.5% of the laboratory reference value and considered accurate. Regression analysis showed good correlation of subject values to laboratory and HCP results (R2=0.93 for both). The average within-subject coefficient of variation was 4.57% (n=74). The FTF rates with and without instructional DVD were 11.3% (n=56) and 39.6% (n=54), respectively. Subjects with diabetes/prediabetes overwhelmingly indicated that they were "very" to "extremely" likely (93.5%) to discuss their home A1C results with their HCP.
Lay users found the A1CNow SELFCHECK easy to use, and both lay users and HCPs were able to measure A1C accurately.
Cranberry has been proposed as an anti-biofilm agent that does not kill bacteria, but rather prevents the pathogen from survival in the host. This can be achieved by inhibiting the function of virulent factors essential for the pathogen to persist in a host environment. The oral bacterial enzyme fructosyltransferase (FTF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of dental diseases. The real-time interaction of cranberry nondialyzable material (NDM) with immobilized FTF was investigated using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. To determine its binding efficiency, NDM at concentrations between 0 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL was applied onto the immobilized FTF. The effect of NDM or other polyphenols, myricetin, and epicatechin on FTF enzymatic activity was evaluated by applying the above compounds and sucrose onto immobilized FTF. Salivary amylase was applied with NDM onto immobilized FTF to explore the effect on NDM-FTF interaction. Our results show that NDM firmly attaches to immobilized FTF in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the presence of salivary amylase reduced this binding interaction. Using nonlinear regression we calculated that the affinity constant of NDM applied alone (10⁶ M⁻¹) was fivefold higher than NDM in the presence of amylase (0.2  x 10⁶ M⁻¹). At 200 μg/mL, NDM, introduced together with sucrose, inhibited the activity of immobilized FTF by 63% within minutes, in comparison with the control (sucrose alone). The effect of NDM was sustained even after it was washed off the immobilized FTF. Myricetin also strongly inhibited FTF activity, whereas epicatechin was less effective. The real-time SPR observation suggests that one of the anti-biofilm modes of action of NDM is an immediate and irreversible inhibitory effect on the activity of immobilized FTF, which is due to a strong binding affinity to the immobilized enzyme.
Homopolysaccharide (glucan and fructan) synthesis from sucrose by sucrase enzymes in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been well studied in the genera Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. This study aimed to identify and characterize genes encoding glucansucrase/glucosyltransferase (GTF) and fructansucrases/fructosyltransferase (FTF) enzymes from genomic DNA of 'rare' Indonesian exopolysaccharide-producing LAB. From a total of 63 exopolysaccharide-producing LAB isolates obtained from foods, beverages and environmental samples, 18 isolates showing the most slimy and mucoid colony morphologies on sucrose were chosen for further study. By comparing bacterial growth on De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS)-sucrose with that on MRS-raffinose, and using the results of a previous PCR screening study with degenerate primer pairs targeting the conserved catalytic domain of GTFs, various strains were identified as producers of fructan (13), of glucan only (five) or as potential producers of both glucan and fructan (nine). Here, we report the characteristics of three gtf genes and one ftf gene obtained from Weissella confusa strains MBF8-1 and MBF8-2. Strain MBF8-1 harbored two putative gtf genes with high sequence similarity to GTFB of Lactobacillus reuteri 121 and GTF180 of L. reuteri 180, respectively. Strain MBF8-2 possessed single gtf and ftf genes with high sequence similarity to GTFKg3 of Lactobacillus fermentum Kg3 and DSRWC of Weissella cibaria, and FTF levansucrase of L. reuteri 121, respectively.
To investigate the role of SecA in protein secretion, and to evaluate the effect of biofilm formation on protein secretion in Streptococcus mutans.
S. mutans strains UA159 and GS-5 were used in this study. Cells grown in biofilm and planktonic conditions were observed using immunogold electron microscopy. The mRNA levels of ftf, gtfB, gtfC, gtfD, Pac and secA were analysed in different growth conditions using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The levels of wall proteins and whole-cell protein extracts were examined using Western blot analysis.
A microdomain colocalised with SecA and virulence factors such as Pac (AgI/II) and glucosyltransferase (GTF) was observed. The mRNA level of secA was upregulated in the biofilm condition. The level of protein expression of SecA and wall protein levels of GTF, fructosyltransferase (FTF) and Pac (AgI/II) in the biofilm condition were significantly higher than in the planktonic condition.
These data suggest that S. mutans utilises the Sec pathway to secrete virulence factor proteins such as Pac (AgI/II), GTF and FTF, and protein secretion occurred at a distinct microdomain. The level of SecA, the key factor in the Sec pathway, was influenced significantly by biofilm formation in S. mutans.
Exopolysaccharides (EPS) can affect the rheological properties of foods, act as stabilizers or stimulate preferential growth of bifidobacteria in the gut and therefore function as prebiotics. The latter is referred to fructans, which are synthesized from sucrose by fructosyl transferases (FTFs). In this work, the FTF enzyme of Lactobacillus panis TMW1.648 isolated from sourdough was characterized. The coding gene was identified, sequenced and expressed heterologously in E. coli. Enzyme activity was maximal at pH 4.0-4.6, 45 degrees C and a substrate concentration of 300 mmol l(-1). It produced free fructose, a high molecular fructan and the oligosaccharide kestose from sucrose. Calcium ions proved to be essential for the enzymatic activity. In comparison to published data of other FTF enzymes of lactobacilli the described enzyme showed significant differences.
Fructansucrase enzymes polymerize the fructose moiety of sucrose into levan or inulin fructans, with beta(2-6) and beta(2-1) linkages, respectively. The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC 533 possesses a single fructansucrase gene (open reading frame AAS08734) annotated as a putative levansucrase precursor. However, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of the fructan product synthesized in situ revealed that this is of the inulin type. The ftf gene of L. johnsonii was cloned and expressed to elucidate its exact identity. The purified L. johnsonii protein was characterized as an inulosucrase enzyme, producing inulin from sucrose, as identified by (13)C NMR analysis. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction products showed that InuJ synthesized, besides the inulin polymer, a broad range of fructose oligosaccharides. Maximum InuJ enzyme activity was observed in a pH range of 4.5 to 7.0, decreasing sharply at pH 7.5. InuJ exhibited the highest enzyme activity at 55 degrees C, with a drastic decrease at 60 degrees C. Calcium ions were found to have an important effect on enzyme activity and stability. Kinetic analysis showed that the transfructosylation reaction of the InuJ enzyme does not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The non-Michaelian behavior of InuJ may be attributed to the oligosaccharides that were initially formed in the reaction and which may act as better acceptors than the growing polymer chain. This is only the second example of the isolation and characterization of an inulosucrase enzyme and its inulin (oligosaccharide) product from a Lactobacillus strain. Furthermore, this is the first Lactobacillus strain shown to produce inulin polymer in situ.
A non-nucleosidic compound, Helioxanthin (HE-145), was found to suppress HBV gene expression and replication in HCC cells. To understand the molecular mode of action of HE-145 on HBV gene expression, the effects of HE-145 on four viral promoter activities using luciferase as a reporter were examined. It was found that HE-145 selectively suppresses surface antigen promoter II (SPII) and core promoter (CP) but has no effect on surface antigen promoter I (SPI) or promoter for X gene (Xp). The suppressive effects of HE-145 on either SPII or CP activity is liver-specific, since no suppressive activity of HE-145 was observed when CP or SPII promoter activity was assayed in non-liver cells such as HeLa or 293T. To examine the mode of action of HE-145, EMSA analysis revealed that HE-145 decreased the DNA-binding activity of nuclear extract of HepA2 cells to specific cis element of HBV promoter for core antigen, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPARs binding site (PPRE), alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), and Sp1. Ectopic expression of PPAR gamma or HNF4 alpha partially reversed the HE-145-mediated suppression of HBV RNA. Therefore, HE-145 may represent a novel class of anti-HBV agents which selectively modulate transcriptional machinery of human liver cells to suppress HBV gene expression and replication.
Inulosucrase (IslA) from Leuconostoc citreum CW28 belongs to a new subfamily of multidomain fructosyltransferases (FTFs), containing additional domains from glucosyltransferases. It is not known what the function of the additional domains in this subfamily is.
Through construction of truncated versions we demonstrate that the acquired regions are involved in anchoring IslA to the cell wall; they also confer stability to the enzyme, generating a larger structure that affects its kinetic properties and reaction specificity, particularly the hydrolysis and transglycosylase ratio. The accessibility of larger molecules such as EDTA to the catalytic domain (where a Ca2+ binding site is located) is also affected as demonstrated by the requirement of 100 times higher EDTA concentrations to inactivate IslA with respect to the smallest truncated form.
The C-terminal domain may have been acquired to anchor inulosucrase to the cell surface. Furthermore, the acquired domains in IslA interact with the catalytic core resulting in a new conformation that renders the enzyme more stable and switch the specificity from a hydrolytic to a transglycosylase mechanism. Based on these results, chimeric constructions may become a strategy to stabilize and modulate biocatalysts based on FTF activity.
The multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3/gene symbol: ABCC3) is an ATP-dependent efflux pump mediating the transport of endogenous glucuronides and conjugated drug metabolites across cell membranes. In humans the hepatic expression of ABCC3 mRNA seems to be influenced by the polymorphism C&gt;T at the position -211 in the promoter of the ABCC3 gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of how this SNP influences the MRP3 expression. Promoter luciferase reporter gene constructs representing 0.5, 1.1, 4.4, and 8.1 kb upstream of the translational start site were cloned with cytosine or thymine at position -211 and transfected into HepG2, Caco-2, and LS174T cells. Reporter gene activity was dependent on the length of the promoter sequence but interestingly not on the nucleotide at position -211. Cotransfection with FTF cDNA (Fetoprotein Transcription Factor) binding to elements near the -211 polymorphism increased promoter activity in all constructs except the 0.5 kb fragment also independently of the -211 SNP. Taken together, we did not find any influence of the -211C&gt;T ABCC3 promoter polymorphism on either the basal or the FTF induced reporter gene activity. Whether other tissue specific mechanisms reveal an impact of this SNP on the in vivo regulation of MRP3 remains to be determined.
A novel subfamily of putative intracellular invertase enzymes (glycoside hydrolase family 32) has previously been identified in fungal genomes. Here, we report phylogenetic, molecular, and biochemical characteristics of SucB, one of two novel intracellular invertases identified in Aspergillus niger. The sucB gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and an invertase-negative strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Enzyme purified from E. coli lysate displayed a molecular mass of 75 kDa, judging from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Its optimum pH and temperature for sucrose hydrolysis were determined to be 5.0 and 37 to 40 degrees C, respectively. In addition to sucrose, the enzyme hydrolyzed 1-kestose, nystose, and raffinose but not inulin and levan. SucB produced 1-kestose and nystose from sucrose and 1-kestose, respectively. With nystose as a substrate, products up to a degree of polymerization of 4 were observed. SucB displayed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with substrate inhibition on sucrose (apparent K(m), K(i), and V(max) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 mM, 268.1 +/- 18.1 mM, and 6.6 +/- 0.2 mumol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein [total activity], respectively). At sucrose concentrations up to 400 mM, transfructosylation (FTF) activity contributed approximately 20 to 30% to total activity. At higher sucrose concentrations, FTF activity increased to up to 50% of total activity. Disruption of sucB in A. niger resulted in an earlier onset of sporulation on solid medium containing various carbon sources, whereas no alteration of growth in liquid culture medium was observed. SucB thus does not play an essential role in inulin or sucrose catabolism in A. niger but may be needed for the intracellular conversion of sucrose to fructose, glucose, and small oligosaccharides.
NR5A2, also known as liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) and fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), is an orphan nuclear receptor involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and steroidogenesis in the adult. NR5A2 was also shown to be expressed during early mouse embryogenesis. Consistent with its early expression pattern, a targeted disruption of this gene leads to embryonic lethality around the gastrulation period. To characterize the embryonic phenotype resulting from NR5A2 loss of function, we undertook morphological and marker gene analyses and showed that NR5A2-/- embryos display growth retardation, epiblast disorganization, a mild embryonic-extraembryonic constriction, as well as abnormal thickening of the proximo-posterior epiblast. We demonstrated that, although initial specification of the anterior-posterior axis occurred in the absence of NR5A2, primitive streak formation was impaired and neither embryonic nor extraembryonic mesoderm was generated. Moreover, although the visceral endoderm does not show major morphological abnormalities in NR5A2-/- embryos, a decrease in the expression level of HNF4 and GATA4 was observed. Aggregation experiments demonstrated that, in the presence of wild-type tetraploid cells, NR5A2 mutant cells in the epiblast are capable of undergoing normal gastrulation. Therefore, our results suggest a requirement for NR5A2 in extraembryonic tissues and identify a novel role of this gene in proper primitive streak morphogenesis.
Dental diseases are among the most prevalent afflictions of humankind. These diseases are associated with the formation of biofilms harboring pathogenic bacteria. Fructosyltransferases (FTF) are extra cellular enzymes of several oral bacteria. FTF are associated with the formation of extracellular polysaccharide matrix (fructans) which play a role in biofilm formation and oral bacteria physiology. Oxazaborolidines have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation. The purpose of this study was to examine if the anti-biofilm effect is, in part, an effect on the immobilized enzymes synthesizing the extra cellular polysaccharide participating in biofilm formation. Eight different oxazaborolidines (BNO1-BNO8) were synthesized and evaluated for their affect on the synthesis of fructans by FTF using the biomolecular interaction analysis (BIAcore) system which involves the use of real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. The tested oxazaborolidines demonstrated a significant and immediate inhibitory effect on immobilized FTF activity. This effect was reversible. Our results show that oxazaborolidines can act as enzymatic inhibitors of FTF immobilized on the surface, also at levels lower than their MIC. Part of the anti-biofilm effect of BNOs may be accounted for this enzymatic inhibition.
Exopolysaccharide synthesis, biofilm formation, and competence are important physiologic functions and virulence factors for Streptococcus mutans. In this study, we report the role of Frp, a transcriptional regulator, on the regulation of these traits crucial to pathogenesis. An Frp-deficient mutant showed decreased transcription of several genes important in virulence, including those encoding fructosyltransferase (Ftf), glucosyltransferase B (GtfB), and GtfC, by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of Ftf was decreased in the frp mutant, as assessed by Western blotting as well as by the activity assays. Frp deficiency also inhibited the production of GtfB in the presence of glucose and sucrose as well as the production of GtfC in the presence of glucose. As a consequence of the effects on GtfB and -C, sucrose-induced biofilm formation was decreased in the frp mutant. The expression of competence mediated by the competence-signaling peptide (CSP) system, as assessed by comC gene transcription, was attenuated in the frp mutant. As a result, the transformation efficiency was decreased in the frp mutant but was partially restored by adding synthetic CSP. Transcription of the frp gene was significantly increased in the frp mutant under all conditions tested, indicating that frp transcription is autoregulated. Furthermore, complementation of the frp gene in the frp mutant restored transcription of the affected genes to levels similar to those in the wild-type strain. These results suggest that Frp is a novel pleiotropic effector of multiple cellular functions and is involved in the modulation of exopolysaccharide synthesis, sucrose-dependent biofilm formation, and competence development.
Dental caries is one of the most common infectious diseases that affects humans. Streptococcus mutans, the main pathogenic bacterium associated with dental caries, produces a number of extracellular sucrose-metabolizing enzymes, such as glucosyltransferases (GTFB, GTFC and GTFD) and fructosyltransferase (FTF). The cooperative action of these enzymes is essential for sucrose-dependent cellular adhesion and biofilm formation. A global response regulator (vicR) plays important roles in S. mutans ftf and gtf expression in response to a variety of stimuli. A real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain-reaction was used to quantify the relative levels of ftf, gtfB, gtfC, gtfD and vicR transcription of S. mutans in the presence of various dietary carbohydrates: sucrose, D-glucose, D-fructose, D-glucitol (D-sorbitol), D-mannitol and xylitol. Ftf was highly expressed at late exponential phase in the presence of sorbitol and mannitol. GtfB was highly expressed in the presence of all the above carbohydrates except for xylitol at early exponential growth phase and glucose and fructose at late exponential growth phase. Similar to gtfB, the expression of gtfC was also induced with the presence of all the tested carbohydrates except for xylitol at early growth and glucose and fructose at late exponential phase. In addition, no effect of mannitol on gtfC expression at early exponential phase was observed. GtfD was less influenced compared to the gtfB and gtfC, demonstrating enhanced expression especially in the presence of sorbitol, glucose, mannitol and xylitol at early exponential phase and mannitol at late exponential phase. VicR expression was induced only at the presence of xylitol at late exponential phase, and a decrease in expression was recorded at early exponential phase. Our findings show that dietary carbohydrates have a major influence on the transcription of ftf, gtfB, gtfC and gtfD, but less on vicR. Sorbitol and mannitol, which are considered as noncariogenic sugar substitutes, may indirectly affect caries by promoting biofilm formation via enhanced expression of gtfs and ftf. These results suggest regulatory circuits for exopolysaccharide gene expression in S. mutans.
Previous work aimed at developing a live oral vaccine expressing pertussis toxin S1 fragment on the surface of the bacterium Streptococcus gordonii elicited a lower than expected antibody response, perhaps because of low antigen expression. In this study, in-frame promoter fusions were constructed to investigate whether an increase in antigen production by the streptococcal vaccine strain results in a better antibody response. The promoters tested were (i) the Streptococcus mutans sucrose-inducible fructosyltransferase (ftf) promoter and (ii) the Bacillus subtilis/Escherichia coli chimeric tetracycline-inducible xyl/tetO promoter. Each of these two promoters was placed upstream of the spaP/s1 fusion gene to drive its expression. The constructs were introduced into S. gordonii DL1 and S. mutans 834. The inducibility of the promoters was confirmed through the determination of SpaP/S1 production via Western blottings. Induced production of SpaP/S1 was observed in S. gordonii and S. mutans with each of the promoters, but the level of expression was the highest in S. mutans, using the xyl/tetO promoter. Thus, S. mutans carrying the xyl/tetO/spaP/s1 construct (S. mutans PM14) was used in oral colonization studies in BALB/c mice. Streptococccus mutans PM14 was able to colonize the animals for the 14-week duration of experimentation. A mucosal IgA response was observed in all the treatment groups but was highest in mice receiving tetracycline induction. In the mouse model of Bordetella pertussis respiratory infection, animals colonized with S. mutans PM14 showed a decreased in B. pertussis lung colony count (P = 0.03) on day 3 compared with control mice colonized by the parent S. mutans 834.
The abilities to form biofilms on teeth surface and to metabolize a wide range of carbohydrates are key virulence attributes of Streptococcus mutans. ClpP has been proved to play an important role in biofilm development in streptococci. Here we demonstrated that ClpP was involved in biofilm formation of S. mutans. ClpP inactivation resulted in enhanced biofilm formation or initial cell adherence in broth supplemented with sucrose, while reduced in broth supplemented with glucose or fructose. Our results also indicated that the enhanced capacities of biofilm formation and initial cell adherence were achieved through regulating the expression of a number of extracellular sucrose-metabolizing enzymes, such as glucosyltransferases (GTFB and GTFC) at early-exponential growth phase and fructosyltransferase at late-exponential growth phase in the presence of sucrose.
Fructan-exopolysaccharides (fructan-EPS) (inulin and levan) and their oligosaccharides (fructooligosaccharides, FOS) have drawn considerable interest in the food and pharmaceutical industries. EPS-producing lactic acid bacteria have been reported to produce β-fructans (inulin and levan), as well as α-glucans, by the function of sucrase enzymes, i.e., fructansucrase and glucansucrase. A fructansucrase ftfCNC-2(1) gene from Weissella confusa strain MBFCNC-2(1) was previously cloned in Escherichia coli. In this study, we aimed to express the ftf[CNC-2(1)] gene in Bacillus subtilis to obtain the active form of the extracellular recombinant protein FTF[CNC-2(1)]. This cloning was achieved by inserting the gene in-fusion with the signal sequence of the B. subtilis subtilisin E. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and in situ activity assay with Periodic Acid-Schiff staining revealed that the recombinant FTF[CNC-2(1)] was successfully expressed as an extracellular protein from B. subtilis DB403 in its active form, which was confirmed using sucrose and raffinose.
Synthetic molecular motors typically take nanometer-scale steps through rectification of thermal motion. Here we propose Inchworm, a DNA-based motor that employs a pronounced power stroke to take micrometer-scale steps on a time scale of seconds, and we design, fabricate, and analyze the nanofluidic device needed to operate the motor. Inchworm is a kbp-long, double-stranded DNA confined inside a nanochannel in a stretched configuration. Motor stepping is achieved through externally controlled changes in salt concentration (changing the DNA's extension), coordinated with ligand-gated binding of the DNA's ends to the functionalized nanochannel surface. Brownian dynamics simulations predict that Inchworm's stall force is determined by its entropic spring constant and is ∼ 0.1 pN. Operation of the motor requires periodic cycling of four different buffers surrounding the DNA inside a nanochannel, while keeping constant the hydrodynamic load force on the DNA. We present a two-layer fluidic device incorporating 100 nm-radius nanochannels that are connected through a few-nm-wide slit to a microfluidic system used for in situ buffer exchanges, either diffusionally (zero flow) or with controlled hydrodynamic flow. Combining experiment with finite-element modeling, we demonstrate the device's key performance features and experimentally establish achievable Inchworm stepping times of the order of seconds or faster.
Semiconductor nanowires are widely used to interface living cells, and numerous nanowire-based devices have been developed to manipulate or sense cell behavior. We have, however, little knowledge on the nature of the cell-nanowire interface. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein promoting cell attachment and growth. Here, we used a method based on fluorescence microscopy and measured the relative amount of laminin adsorbed on nanowires compared to flat surfaces. The amount of adsorbed laminin per surface area is up to 4 times higher on 55nm diameter gallium phosphide nanowires compared to the flat gallium phosphide surface between the nanowires. We show that this enhanced adsorption on nanowires cannot be attributed to electrostatic effects, nor to differences in surface chemistry, but possibly to pure geometrical effects, as increasing the nanowire diameter results in a decreased amount of adsorbed protein. The increased adsorption of laminin on nanowires may explain the exceptionally beneficial properties of nanowire substrates for cellular growth reported in the literature since laminin is often used as surface coating prior to cell cultures in order to promote cell growth, and also because primary cell suspensions contain endogenous laminin. 
It is unclear if patients with CML treated with imatinib who fail to achieve BCR/ABL transcript levels &lt;10%(IS) at 3 months i.e. an early molecular response (EMR) have a better prognosis if they achieve a response by 6 months. We reviewed 320 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase receiving Imatinib therapy with 3 and 6 month BCR/ABL transcript levels available, and divided them into four groups. Group I (achieved an EMR at 3 months), Group II (did not achieve an EMR at 3 months, but achieved a transcript level of &lt;1% at 6 months), Group III (did not achieve an EMR at 3 months, then at 6 months achieved a level between 1% and 10%) and Group IV (failed to achieve a response at 3 and 6 months). Compared to Group I, Group IV showed significantly worse freedom from treatment failure (FTF; 93.1% vs 69.0%, P &lt; 0.001), progression free survival (97.7% vs 77.3%, P &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (98.3% vs 78.9%, P &lt; 0.001). While, group III showed inferior PFS (98.3% vs 90.4%, P = 0.013) and OS (97.7% vs 90.4%, P = 0.037), but no difference in FTF (93.1% vs 92.0%, P = 0.520). There were no significant differences between Groups I and II. A BCR/ABL transcript level at 6 months can identify a "good-risk" subgroup among patients who fail to achieve an EMR on Imatinib therapy for CML.
To investigate the regulatory function on physiology and virulence of VicK kinase activity in Streptococcus mutans.
PCR ligation mutagenesis was used to construct a vicK knock-out mutant, and kinase activity abolished VicK was expressed by a streptococcal vector in this vicK null mutant. Colony morphology, overnight culture, biofilm formation and gene expression involved in biofilm formation were analyzed. Delta VicK, strains harboring a complemented wild-type vicK, and a vector without insert were used as controls.
Colonies of VicK(H217A) were smoother and more elevated than that of wild-type UA159 and complementary strain SMCVicK; cells from VicK(H217A) overnight culture coaggregated on the bottom of glass tubes; no obvious alteration was observed in VicK(H217A) biofilm; expressions of gbpB, ftf, gtfD were repressed while gtfB/C were up-regulated (P &lt; 0.05).
VicK kinase activity is important for maintaining normal growth, biofilm formation and expression of genes involved in biofilm formation in Streptococcus mutans.
Streptococcus mutans is considered the primary etiologic agent of dental caries and contributes significantly to the virulence of dental plaque, especially in the presence of sucrose. To avoid the role of sucrose on the virulence factors of S. mutans, sugar substitutes are commonly consumed because they lead to lower or no production of acids and interfere with biofilm formation. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of sugar substitutes in the cariogenic potential of S. mutans biofilms. Thus, in the presence of sucrose, glucose, sucralose and sorbitol, the biofilm mass was quantified up to 96 h, the pH of the spent culture media was measured, the expression of biofilm-related genes was determined, and demineralization challenge experiments were conduct in enamel fragments. The presence of sugars or sugar substitutes profoundly affected the expression of spaP, gtfB, gtfC, gbpB, ftf, vicR and vicX in either biofilm or planktonic cells. The substitution of sucrose induced a down-regulation of most genes involved in sucrose-dependent colonization in biofilm cells. When the ratio between the expression of biofilm and planktonic cells was considered, most of those genes were down-regulated in biofilm cells in the presence of sugars and up-regulated in the presence of sugar substitutes. However, sucralose but not sorbitol fulfilled the purpose of reducing the cariogenic potential of the diet since it induced the biofilm formation with the lowest biomass, did not change the pH of the medium and led to the lowest lesion depth in the cariogenic challenge.
This study was undertaken with the objectives of formulating composite bread by utilising finger millet flour and foxtail millet flour and further to evaluate these breads for sensory, nutritional qualities, and glycemic response.
Two genotypes of finger millet VL-146 and PRM-601 and one local cultivar of foxtail millet were studied. The finger millet flour (FMF) and foxtail millet flour (FTF) were individually blended in various proportions (30 to 60%) into refined wheat flour (RWF). These blends were then used in the preparation of composite breads. The refined wheat flour bread (RWF) served as the control. One bread from each millet flour blend was selected finally for further investigation on the basis of sensory scores.
As the 30% millet flour substitution was most preferred among the three millet samples, it was selected for further evaluation. Nutrient composition of the selected breads showed that composite bread formulated using FTF showed significantly higher crude protein, crude fat, total ash, phosphorus and insoluble dietary fibre. The composite bread formulated using FMF contained significantly higher calcium, soluble dietary fibre, tannin and phytic acid. However, the control (RWF) bread contained significantly higher carbohydrate, physiological energy and starch. The lowest value for glycemic index among the breads was observed for bread containing FMF from genotype VL- 146 (41.43), followed by bread containing FMF from the genotype PRM- 601 (43.10), bread containing FTF (49.53) and control bread (67.82).
Millet flour incorporated breads had low glycemic indices and were acceptable and nutritious.
The ability to test the response of cells and proteins to a changing biochemical environment is of interest for studies of fundamental cell physiology and molecular interactions. In a common experimental scheme the cells or molecules of interest are attached to a surface and the composition of the surrounding fluid is changed. It is desirable to be able to switch several different biochemical reagents in any arbitrary order, and to keep the flow velocity low enough so that the cells and molecules remain attached and can be expected to retain their function. Here we develop a device with these capabilities, using U-shaped access channels. We use total-internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to characterize the time-dependent change in concentration during switching of solutions near the device surface. Well-defined fluid interfaces are formed in the immediate vicinity of the surface ensuring distinct switching events. We show that the experimental data agrees well with Taylor-Aris theory in its range of validity. In addition, we find that well-defined interfaces are achieved also in the immediate vicinity of the surface, where analytic approaches and numerical models become inaccurate. Assisted by finite-element modelling, the details of our device were designed for use with a specific artificial protein motor, but the key results are general and can be applied to a wide range of biochemical studies in which switching is important.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen that uses the overproduction of alginate, a surface polysaccharide, to form biofilms in vivo. Overproduction of alginate, also known as mucoidy, affords the bacterium protection from the host's defenses and facilitates the establishment of chronic lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Expression of the alginate biosynthetic operon is primarily controlled by the alternative sigma factor AlgU (AlgT/σ(22) ). In a nonmucoid strain, AlgU is sequestered by the transmembrane antisigma factor MucA to the cytoplasmic membrane. AlgU can be released from MucA via regulated intramembrane proteolysis by proteases AlgW and MucP causing the conversion to mucoidy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO579, a derivative of the nonmucoid strain PAO1, is mucoid due to an unidentified mutation (muc-23). Using whole genome sequencing, we identified 16 nonsynonymous and 15 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). We then identified three tandem single point mutations in the pilA gene (PA4525), as the cause of mucoidy in PAO579. These tandem mutations generate a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated version of PilA (PilA(108) ), with a C-terminal motif of phenylalanine-threonine-phenylalanine (FTF). Inactivation of pilA(108) confirmed it was required for mucoidy. Additionally, algW and algU were also required for mucoidy of PAO579. Western blot analysis indicated that MucA was less stable in PAO579 than nonmucoid PAO1 or PAO381. The mucoid phenotype and high PalgU and PalgD promoter activities of PAO579 require pilA(108) , algW, algU, and rpoN encoding the alternative sigma factor σ(54) . We also observed that RpoN regulates expression of algW and pilA in PAO579. Together, these results suggest that truncation in type IV pilin in P. aeruginosa strain PAO579 can induce mucoidy through an AlgW/AlgU-dependent pathway.
Emerging concepts for on-chip biotechnologies aim to replace microfluidic flow by active, molecular-motor driven transport of cytoskeletal filaments, including applications in bio-simulation, biocomputation, diagnostics, and drug screening. Many of these applications require reliable detection, with minimal data acquisition, of filaments at many, local checkpoints in a device consisting of a potentially complex network of channels that guide filament motion. Here we develop such a detection system using actomyosin motility. Detection points consist of pairs of gold lines running perpendicular to nanochannels that guide motion of fluorescent actin filaments. Fluorescence interference contrast (FLIC) is used to locally enhance the signal at the gold lines. A cross-correlation method is used to suppress errors, allowing reliable detection of single or multiple filaments. Optimal device design parameters are discussed. The results open for automatic read-out of filament count and velocity in high-throughput motility assays, helping establish the viability of active, motor-driven on-chip applications.
Ecdysteroids regulate insect growth and development through a heterodimeric complex of nuclear receptors consisting of ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP). In the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, two isoforms each of EcR and USP have been identified. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed isoform-specific developmental expression of both EcR and USP in the epidermis and the midgut dissected from the final instar larvae and pupae. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) prepared using the common or isoform-specific regions of EcR or USP as templates caused derailment of development. EcR common region (EcRC) or EcRA dsRNA caused more severe effects, and most of the treated larvae died prior to pupation. EcRB dsRNA caused less severe effects and most of the treated larvae became pupae but showed developmental defects. Only dsRNA prepared against USP common region but not against USPA or USPB isoform-specific region caused developmental defects during larval-pupal metamorphosis. Determination of mRNA levels of EcR isoforms and 20-hydroxyecdysone-response (20E) genes (broad, E75, E74, HR3 and FTZ-F1) by qRT-PCR in the larvae injected with EcRA, EcRB or EcRC dsRNA showed that EcRA initiates ecdysteroid action by regulation the expression of EcRB and 20E-response genes. These data suggest that the EcR but not USP isoforms play distinct roles during the larval-pupal metamorphosis and EcRA plays a dominant role in transduction of ecdysteroid response in T. castaneum.
Ecdysteroids regulate many aspects of insect physiology after binding to a heterodimer composed of the nuclear hormone receptor proteins ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (Usp). Several lines of evidence have suggested that the latter also plays important roles in mediating the action of juvenile hormone (JH) and, thus, integrates signaling by the two morphogenetic hormones. By using an RNAi approach, we show here that Usp participates in the mechanism that regulates the progression of pupal development in Apis mellifera, as indicated by the observed pupal developmental delay in usp knocked-down bees. Knock-down experiments also suggest that the expression of regulatory genes such as ftz transcription factor 1 (ftz-f1) and juvenile hormone esterase (jhe) depend on Usp. Vitellogenin (vg), the gene coding the main yolk protein in honeybees, does not seem to be under Usp regulation, thus suggesting that the previously observed induction of vg expression by JH during the last stages of pupal development is mediated by yet unknown transcription factor complexes.
The Tribolium genome contains 21 nuclear receptors, representing all of the six known subfamilies. This first complete set for a coleopteran species reveals a strong conservation of the number and identity of nuclear receptors in holometabolous insects. Two novelties are observed: the atypical NR0 gene knirps is present only in brachyceran flies, while the NR2E6 gene is found only in Tribolium and in Apis. Using a quantitative analysis of the evolutionary rate, we discovered that nuclear receptors could be divided into two groups. In one group of 13 proteins, the rates follow the trend of the Mecopterida genome-wide acceleration. In a second group of five nuclear receptors, all acting early during the ecdysone cascade, we observed an even higher increase of the evolutionary rate during the early divergence of Mecopterida. We thus extended our analysis to the 12 classic ecdysone transcriptional regulators and found that six of them (ECR, USP, HR3, E75, HR4 and Kr-h1) underwent an increase in evolutionary rate at the base of the Mecopterida lineage. By contrast, E74, E93, BR, HR39, FTZ-F1 and E78 do not show this divergence. We suggest that coevolution occurred within a network of regulators that control the ecdysone cascade. The advent of Tribolium as a powerful model should allow a better understanding of this evolutionary event.
Regulatory mechanisms controlling the timing of developmental events are crucial for proper development to occur. ftz-f1 is expressed in a temporally regulated manner following pulses of ecdysteroid and this precise expression is necessary for the development of Drosophila melanogaster. To understand how insect hormone ecdysteroids regulate the timing of FTZ-F1 expression, we purified a DNA binding regulator of ftz-f1. Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed this protein to be a fly homolog of mammalian B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1). Drosophila Blimp-1 (dBlimp-1) is induced directly by 20-hydroxyecdysone, and its product exists during high-ecdysteroid periods and turns over rapidly. Forced expression of dBlimp-1 and RNA interference analysis indicate that dBlimp-1 acts as a repressor and controls the timing of FTZ-F1 expression. Furthermore, its prolonged expression results in delay of pupation timing. These results suggest that the transient transcriptional repressor dBlimp-1 is important for determining developmental timing in the ecdysone-induced pathway.
Insect ecdysis sequence is composed of pre-ecdysis, ecdysis and post-ecdysis behaviors controlled by a complex cascade of peptide hormones from endocrine Inka cells and neuropeptides in the central nervous system (CNS). Inka cells produce pre-ecdysis and ecdysis triggering hormones (ETH) which activate the ecdysis sequence through receptor-mediated actions on specific neurons in the CNS. Multiple experimental approaches have been used to determine mechanisms of ETH expression and release from Inka cells and its action on the CNS of moths and flies. During the preparatory phase 1-2 days prior to ecdysis, high ecdysteroid levels induce expression of ETH receptors in the CNS and increased ETH production in Inka cells, which coincides with expression of nuclear ecdysone receptor (EcR) and transcription factor cryptocephal (CRC). However, high ecdysteroid levels prevent ETH release from Inka cells. Acquisition of Inka cell competence to release ETH requires decline of ecdysteroid levels and beta-FTZ-F1 expression few hours prior to ecdysis. The behavioral phase is initiated by ETH secretion into the hemolymph, which is controlled by two brain neuropeptides-corazonin and eclosion hormone (EH). Corazonin acts on its receptor in Inka cells to elicit low level ETH secretion and initiation of pre-ecdysis, while EH induces cGMP-mediated ETH depletion and consequent activation of ecdysis. The activation of both behaviors is accomplished by ETH action on central neurons expressing ETH receptors A and B (ETHR-A and B). These neurons produce numerous excitatory or inhibitory neuropeptides which initiate or terminate different phases of the ecdysis sequence. Our data indicate that insect ecdysis is a very complex process characterized by two principal steps: (1) ecdysteroid-induced expression of receptors and transcription factors in the CNS and Inka cells. (2) Release and interaction of Inka cell peptide hormones and multiple central neuropeptides to control consecutive phases of the ecdysis sequence.
The orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides is a protogynous hermaphroditic fish, but the physiological basis of its sex change remains largely unknown. In the present study, the 2-year-old orange-spotted grouper was induced to change sex precociously by oral administration of 17alpha-methyltestosterone (MT, 50 mg/Kg diet, twice a day at daily ration of 5% bodyweight) for 60 days. The serum testosterone levels were significantly elevated after MT treatment for 20 and 40 days as compared to control, but the levels of serum estradiol (E(2)) remained unchanged. The expression of P450aromA in the gonad significantly decreased after MT treatment for 20, 40, and 60 days. Accordingly, the enzyme activity of gonadal aromatase was also lower. The expression of FSHbeta subunit in the pituitary was significantly decreased after MT treatment for 20 days, but returned to the control levels after 40 and 60 days; however, the expression of LHbeta subunit was not altered significantly by MT treatment. The expression of FTZ-F1 in the gonad also decreased significantly in response to MT treatment for 40 and 60 days, but its expression in the pituitary was not altered significantly. Interestingly, when tested in vitro on ovarian fragments, MT had no direct effect on the expression of P450aromA and FTZ-F1 as well as the activity of gonadal aromatase, suggesting that the inhibition of gonadal P450aromatase and FTZ-F1 by MT may be mediated at upper levels of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis. Taken together, these results indicated that FSH, P450aromA, FTZ-F1, and serum testosterone are associated with the MT-induced sex change of the orange-spotted grouper, but the cause-effect relationship between these factors and sex change in this species remains to be characterized.
Hormones provide generalized signals that are interpreted in a specific spatial and temporal manner by a developing or reproducing multicellular organism. The ability to respond to hormones is determined by the competence of a cell or a tissue. The betaFtz-F1 orphan nuclear receptor acts as a competence factor for the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in Drosophila melanogaster metamorphosis and mosquito reproduction. The molecular nature of the betaFtz-F1 action remains unclear. We report that the protein-protein interaction between betaFtz-F1 and a p160/SRC coactivator of the ecdysone receptor, FISC, is crucial for the stage-specific expression of the 20E effector genes during mosquito reproduction. This interaction dramatically increases recruitment of FISC to the functional ecdysone receptor in a 20E-dependent manner. The presence of betaFtz-F1 facilitates loading of FISC and the ecdysone receptor on the target promoters, leading to enhanced local histone H4 acetylation and robust activation of the target genes. Thus, our results reveal the molecular basis of competence for the stage-specific 20E response.
Hox genes encode DNA binding transcription factors that regulate the body plans of metazoans by regulating the expression of downstream target 'realizator genes' that direct morphogenesis and growth. Although some Hox target genes have been identified, the code used by Hox proteins to select regulatory targets remains elusive. This failure is due, in part, to the overlapping and promiscuous DNA binding potential of different Hox proteins. The identification of cofactors that modulate Hox DNA binding specificity suggested that target site selection is specified by composite binding sites in the genome for a Hox protein plus its cofactor. Here we have made use of the fact that the DNA binding specificity of the Drosophila Hox protein Fushi Tarazu (Ftz) is modulated by interaction with its partner, the orphan nuclear receptor Ftz-F1, to carry out a computational screen for genomic targets. At least two of the first 30 potential target genes--apontic (apt) and sulfated (Sulf1)--appear to be bona fide targets of Ftz and Ftz-F1. apt is expressed in stripes within the Ftz domain, but posterior to engrailed (en) stripes, suggesting a parasegmental border-independent function of ftz. Ftz/Ftz-F1 activate Sulf1 expression in blastoderm embryos via composite binding sites. Sulf1 encodes a sulfatase thought to be involved in wingless (Wg) signaling. Thus, in addition to regulating en, Ftz and Ftz-F1 coordinately and directly regulate different components of segment polarity pathways in parallel.
Self-renewal of macrophages is important for the healthy development and replenishment of tissue-resident macrophage pools. How this mechanism is controlled by endocrine signals is still largely unexplored. Here, we show that the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) increases macrophage self-renewal. This effect was associated with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and a slight increase in the expression of liver X receptor alpha (LXRα). We found that LXRα inhibition induced, while LXRα activation impeded, macrophage self-renewal. LXRα signaling hence may protect from excessive macrophage expansion. Self-renewing macrophages, however, had negligible LXRα expression when compared with quiescent macrophages. Accordingly, tissue-resident macrophage pools, which are dominated by quiescent macrophages, were rich in LXRα-expressing macrophages. Overall, we show that BPA increases macrophage self-renewal and that this effect, at least in part, can be inhibited by increasing LXRα expression. Since BPA is accumulated in the adipose tissue, it has the potential to increase self-renewal of adipose tissue macrophages, leading to a condition that might negatively impact adipose tissue health.
This study was conducted to assess the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) on lipid accumulation in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella adipose tissue both in vitro and in vivo. EPA was observed to inhibit the adipocyte viability in a time and dose-dependent manner. EPA was also found to induce reactive oxygen species accumulation in vitro. The mRNA levels of caspase 3a and caspase 3b, as well as the activity of Caspase 3 increased significantly in vitro and in vivo, whereas the value of B cell leukemia 2-Bcl-2 associated X protein decreased significantly. Besides, the pro-apoptotic effect was relieved by α-tocopherol. Dietary 0.52% EPA had no apparent effect on intraperitoneal fat index. Moreover, EPA promoted the hydrolytic gene expressions in vitro and in vivo, including adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase-a. Meanwhile, the lipogenic gene expressions of liver X receptor α, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and fatty-acid synthase were down-regulated by EPA in vitro and in vivo. However, EPA also acted to promote the marker gene expressions of adipogenesis, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and lipoprotein lipase in vitro and in vivo. Contents of EPA increased significantly in the treatment groups in vitro and in vivo. These results support that EPA affects multiple aspects of lipid metabolism, including hydrolysis, lipogenesis, adipogenesis and apoptosis. However, it barely functioned in decreasing the lipid accumulation of Ctenopharyngodon idella under the current culture conditions.
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylase. Recent studies have demonstrated that enhancing SIRT1 expression or activity may modulate cholesterol and lipid metabolism. However, pharmacological and molecular regulators for SIRT1 are scarce. Here, we aimed to find novel small molecule modulators of SIRT1 to regulate cholesterol and lipid metabolism.
A high-throughput screening assay was established to identify SIRT1 activators. Surface plasmon resonance and immunoprecipitation were performed to confirm the interaction of E1231 with SIRT1. Cholesterol assay was performed to demonstrate the in vitro effect of E1231. The in vivo effect of E1231 was evaluated in experimental models.
E1231, a piperazine 1,4-diamide compound, was identified as a SIRT1 activator with EC50 value of 0.83 μM. E1231 interacted with recombinant human SIRT1 protein and deacetylated liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα). E1231 increased ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in RAW 264.7 cells dependent on SIRT1 and LXRα. E1231 promoted cholesterol efflux and inhibited lipid accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells via SIRT1 and ABCA1. In the golden hamster hyperlipidemia model, E1231 treatment decreased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in both serum and the liver, while increased cholesterol content in feces. Moreover, E1231 increased ABCA1 and SIRT1 protein expression in the liver. In ApoE-/- mice, E1231 treatment reduced atherosclerotic plaque development compared with untreated ApoE-/- mice.
We identified a novel SIRT1 activator E1231 and elucidated its beneficial effects on lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Our study suggests that E1231 might be developed as a novel drug for treating atherosclerosis.
Oxyresveratrol (OXY) is a naturally occurring polyhydroxylated stilbene that is abundant in mulberry wood (Morus alba L.), which has frequently been supplied as a herbal medicine. It has been shown that OXY has regulatory effects on inflammation and oxidative stress, and may have potential in preventing or curing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study examined the effects of OXY on in vitro model of NAFLD in hepatocyte by the liver X receptor α (LXRα)-mediated induction of lipogenic genes and in vivo model in mice along with its molecular mechanism. OXY inhibited the LXRα agonists-mediated sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) induction and expression of the lipogenic genes and upregulated the mRNA of fatty acid β-oxidation-related genes in hepatocytes, which is more potent than genistein and daidzein. OXY also induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, AMPK activation by the OXY treatment helped inhibit SREBP-1c using compound C as an AMPK antagonist. Oral administration of OXY decreased the Oil Red O stained-positive areas significantly, indicating lipid droplets and hepatic steatosis regions, as well as the serum parameters, such as fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol in high fat diet fed-mice, as similar with orally treatment of atorvastatin. Overall, this result suggests that OXY has the potency to inhibit hepatic lipogenesis through the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway and can be used in the development of pharmaceuticals to prevent a fatty liver.
The prevalence of obesity and atherosclerosis has substantially increased worldwide over the past several decades. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), as fatty acids sensors, have been therapeutic targets in several human lipid metabolic diseases, such as obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and liver X receptors (LXRs) were also reported as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and atherosclerosis, respectively. Further clarification of the internal relationships between these three lipid metabolic nuclear receptors is necessary to enable drug discovery. In this review, we mainly summarized the cross-talk of PPARs-CAR in obesity and PPARs-LXRs in atherosclerosis.
Abnormal metabolism of cholesterol may be a contributing factor in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence has shown that liver X receptor (LXR) is closely related to intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a novel liver-specific LXR inverse agonist, SR9243, on antifibrosis in NASH mice. A high-cholesterol diet was employed to induce NASH in BALB/c mice by either carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) administration or bile-duct ligation (BDL). Once NASH was induced, mice were treated with SR9243 for one month by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Liver tissues were collected to determine the degree of fibrosis and intrahepatic inflammation via pathological examination and QPCR; serum was collected to analyze the plasma lipid levels and liver function by clinical biochemistry. The mice developed hepatic steatosis, severe hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis by BDL or CCL4. Treatment with SR9243 significantly reduced the severity of hepatic inflammation and ameliorated hepatic fibrosis; simultaneously, body weight, serum glucose, and plasma lipid levels were controlled effectively. Our data demonstrate that SR9243 exerts an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect in NASH mice; hence these findings highly suggest that LXR inverse agonist could be therapeutically important in NASH treatment.
We hypothesized that consumption of saturated fatty acids in the form of high-fat ground beef for 5 weeks would depress liver X receptor signaling targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and that changes in gene expression would be associated with the corresponding changes in lipoprotein cholesterol (C) concentrations. Older men (n = 5, age 68.0 ± 4.6 years) and postmenopausal women (n = 7, age 60.9 ± 3.1 years) were assigned randomly to consume ground-beef containing 18% total fat (18F) or 25% total fat (25F), five patties per week for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p &lt; 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of oleic acid (p &lt; 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of palmitic acid (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p &lt; 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p &lt; 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.
Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, have been implicated in multiple physiological functions including promoting neurogenesis, improving synaptic plasticity, preventing neurodegeneration, inhibiting inflammation as well as regulating cholesterol metabolism. However, a potential role of LXRs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) has never been investigated previously. Our present results demonstrated that levels of hippocampal LXRβ but not LXRα were down-regulated in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and were negatively correlated with the severity of CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, rats with LXRβ knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in hippocampus displayed depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis similar to those observed after CUS exposure. Conversely, LXRs activation by GW3965 (GW), a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, could improve depression-like behaviors and reverse the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in rats exposed to CUS. LXRβ knockdown by shRNA completely abrogated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of GW, suggesting that LXRβ isoform mediated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of the LXRα/β dual agonist. However, ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis with x-irradiation only partly but not completely abolished the antidepressant effects of GW in the behavioral tests, implying that the antidepressant effects mediated by LXRβ isoform are likely through both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent pathways. Thus, our findings suggest that LXRβ activation may represent a potential novel target for the treatment of MDD and also provide a novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of MDD.
microRNAs play pivotal roles in metabolism and other aspects of cell biology. microRNA-33 and liver X receptor (LXR) affect lipid metabolism and cholesterol trafficking. In this study, we evaluated effects of co-administration of miR-33 inhibitor and LXR activator on LXR-α and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in mice liver.
Twenty-four mice were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 6). Group 1 mice received standard chow diet without any treatment, group 2 received 30 mg/kg/48 hour LXR agonist (T0901317), group 3 received 1 mg/kg/48 hour in vivo locked nucleic acids (LNA) anti-miR-33 and group 4 received both T0901317 and in vivo LNA anti-miR-33. All treatments were administrated through intraperitoneal injection (IP). After 7 days and at the end of the study, mice were sacrificed, liver tissues were excised and blood samples were collected. LXR-α and ABCA1 genes and protein expression were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting, respectively.
LXR activation caused LXR-α and ABCA1 mRNA (P &lt; 0.050) and protein elevation as compared to control (P &lt; 0.001). miR-33 inhibition attenuates T0901317 effect on LXR-α expression in group IV. Co-administration of T0901317 and anti-miR-33 remarkably elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, compared to control group (P = 0.001). Separate administration of T0901317 and anti-miR-33 also elevated HDL-C levels (P &lt; 0.010).
Co-administration of T0901317 and anti-miR-33 can be considered as a good therapeutic alternative for atherosclerosis because miR-33 inhibition reduced lipogenic effects of LXR-α activator and also helps LXR-α agonist to increase reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and also HDL-C as antiatherogenic effects.
In infants intolerant of enteral feeding because of intestinal disease, parenteral nutrition may be associated with cholestasis, which can progress to end-stage liver disease. Here we show the function of hepatic macrophages and phytosterols in parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) pathogenesis using a mouse model that recapitulates the human pathophysiology and combines intestinal injury with parenteral nutrition. We combine genetic, molecular, and pharmacological approaches to identify an essential function of hepatic macrophages and IL-1β in PNAC. Pharmacological antagonism of  IL-1 signaling or genetic deficiency in CCR2, caspase-1 and caspase-11, or IL-1 receptor (which binds both IL-1α and IL-1β) prevents PNAC in mice. IL-1β increases hepatocyte NF-κB signaling, which interferes with farnesoid X receptor and liver X receptor bonding to respective promoters of canalicular bile and sterol transporter genes (Abcc2, Abcb11, and Abcg5/8), resulting in transcriptional suppression and subsequent cholestasis. Thus, hepatic macrophages, IL-1β, or NF-κB may be targets for restoring bile and sterol transport to treat PNAC.
Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) with synthetic agonists promotes reverse cholesterol transport and protects against atherosclerosis in mouse models. Most synthetic LXR agonists also cause marked hypertriglyceridemia by inducing the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)1c and downstream genes that drive fatty acid biosynthesis. Recent studies demonstrated that desmosterol, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that suppresses SREBP processing by binding to SCAP, also binds and activates LXRs and is the most abundant LXR ligand in macrophage foam cells. Here we explore the potential of increasing endogenous desmosterol production or mimicking its activity as a means of inducing LXR activity while simultaneously suppressing SREBP1c-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Unexpectedly, while desmosterol strongly activated LXR target genes and suppressed SREBP pathways in mouse and human macrophages, it had almost no activity in mouse or human hepatocytes in vitro. We further demonstrate that sterol-based selective modulators of LXRs have biochemical and transcriptional properties predicted of desmosterol mimetics and selectively regulate LXR function in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. These studies thereby reveal cell-specific discrimination of endogenous and synthetic regulators of LXRs and SREBPs, providing a molecular basis for dissociation of LXR functions in macrophages from those in the liver that lead to hypertriglyceridemia.
Crocin (CRO), chlorogenic acid (CGA), geniposide (GEN), and quercetin (QUE) are all natural compounds with anti-obesity properties, in particular, hypolipidemic effects, which have been widely used for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic diseases. However, it is not yet known whether these compounds interact synergistically. Here, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of CRO, CGA, GEN, QUE, and a combination of all four compounds (CCGQ), on lipid accumulation in human hepatoma (HepG2 cells).
The optimal concentration of CRO, CGA, GEN, QUE to stimulate HepG2 cells proliferation was determined using MTT assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with 10 μmol/L simvastatin, 1 μmol/L CRO, 30 μmol/L CGA, 10 μmol/L GEN, 10 μmol/L QUE, and CCGQ (a combination of 1 μmol/L CRO, 30 μmol/L CGA, 10 μmol/L GEN, and 10 μmol/L QUE) for 24 or 48 h. Oil red O staining and extracellular TC and TG levels were detected. The RT-PCR was used to observe on cholesterol metabolism-related gene expression. Immunocytochemistry and western-blot assayed the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMGCR) protein expression in HepG2 cells.
Compared to those of control, we demonstrated that treating HepG2 cells for 48 h with CCGQ resulted in a strong synergistic effect, causing a marked decrease in lipid deposition in comparison to individual treatments, in both triglyceride and total cholesterol (CRO, 5.74- and 1.49-folds; CGA, 3.38- and 1.12-folds; GEN, 4.04- and 1.44-folds; QUE, 3.36- and 1.24-folds; simvastatin, 5.49- and 1.83-folds; and CCGQ, 7.75- and 2.20-folds), and Oil red O staining assays. In addition, CCGQ treatment increased ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and AMP-activated protein kinase 2α (AMPKα2) mRNA expression, while decreasing sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) mRNA expression. Notably, CCGQ was more effective in decreasing HMGCR expression than the individual treatments.
The CCGQ combination has potential, both as a complementary therapy for hyperlipemia, and in preventing further obesity-related complications.
Accumulation of the α-synuclein (α-syn) protein is a hallmark of a group of brain disorders collectively known as synucleinopathies. The mechanisms responsible for α-syn accumulation are not well understood. Several studies suggest a link between synucleinopathies and the cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC). 27-OHC is the major cholesterol metabolite in the blood that crosses the blood brain barrier, and its levels can increase following hypercholesterolemia, aging, and oxidative stress, which are all factors for increased synucleinopathy risk. In this study, we determined the extent to which 27-OHC regulates α-syn levels in human dopaminergic neurons, the cell type in which α-syn accumulates in PD, a major synucleinopathy disorder.
Our results show that 27-OHC significantly increases the protein levels, not the mRNA expression of α-syn. The effects of 27-OHC appear to be independent of an action through liver X receptors (LXR), its cognate receptors, as the LXR agonist, GW3965, or the LXR antagonist ECHS did not affect α-syn protein or mRNA levels. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the 27-OHC-induced increase in α-syn protein levels emanates from inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of this protein and a decrease in the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70).
Identifying 27-OHC as a factor that can increase α-syn levels and the inhibition of the proteasomal function and reduction in HSP70 levels as potential cellular mechanisms involved in regulation of α-syn. This may help in targeting the correct degradation of α-syn as a potential avenue to preclude α-syn accumulation.
The signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) transcription factor activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ)-regulated gene expression in immune cells. We investigated proximal membrane signaling that was initiated in macrophages after exposure to apoptotic cells that led to enhanced PPAR-γ expression and activity, using specific siRNAs for ABCA1, STAT6, and PPAR-γ, or their antagonists. The interactions between mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages or RAW 264.7 cells and apoptotic Jurkat cells, but not viable cells, resulted in the induction of STAT6 phosphorylation as well as PPAR-γ expression and activation. Knockdown of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) after the transfection of macrophages with ABCA1-specific siRNAs reduced apoptotic cell-induced STAT6 phosphorylation as well as PPAR-γ mRNA and protein expression. ABCA1 knockdown also reduced apoptotic cell-induced liver X receptor α (LXR-α) mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, inhibition of STAT6 with specific siRNAs or the pharmacological inhibitor AS1517499AS reversed the induction of PPAR-γ, LXR-α, and ABCA1 by apoptotic Jurkat cells. PPAR-γ-specific siRNAs or the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662 inhibited apoptotic cell-induced increases in LXR-α and ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels. Thus, these results indicate that apoptotic cells trigger the ABCA1/STAT6 pathway, leading to the activation of the PPAR-γ/LXR-α/ABCA1 pathway in macrophages.
Background: Aberrant chronic inflammation and excess accumulation of lipids play a pivotal role in the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechins in green tea, displayed anti-atherosclerotic properties in vivo and in vitro. However, the effects and underlying mechanism of EGCG on atherosclerosis remain unclear. Methods: Male apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice (7 weeks old) fed with high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with normal saline or EGCG (40 mg/kg/d, i.g.) for 18 weeks. Atherosclerotic plaque and liver lipid accumulation were measured by Oil Red staining. Plasma lipids and cytokines were detected using commercial kits. The expression of protein and mRNA was analyzed by western blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: EGCG administration markedly attenuated atherosclerotic plaque formation in HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice, which were accompanied by increased plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) level and decreased plasma IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. In addition, EGCG modulated high-fat-induced dyslipidemia, evidencing by decreased total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein levels and increased high-density lipoprotein level. Meanwhile, EGCG treatment alleviated high-fat-mediated liver lipid accumulation and decreased liver TC and triglyceride. Mechanistically, EGCG significantly modulated high-fat-induced hepatic tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein 39B (TTC39B) expression and its related genes (Lxrβ, Abcg5, Abcg8, Abca1, Srebf1, Scd1, Scd2, Fas, Elovl5, Mylip) expression in liver from ApoE-/- mice. Notably, EGCG remarkably induced hepatic liver X receptor α (LXRα) and LXRβ expression and inhibited both precursor and mature sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1) expression. Conclusion: Taken together, our data for the first time suggested that TTC39B was involved in EGCG-mediated anti-atherosclerotic effects through modulation of LXR/SREBP-1 pathway.
Despite the important role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion from astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and the strong association of apoE4, one of the human apoE isoforms, with sporadic and late onset forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) little is known about the regulation of astrocytic apoE. Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that pan class I HDAC inhibition is a novel pathway for regulating astrocytic apoE secretion.
The Liver X Receptor α (LXRα) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammatory responses. We have previously shown that LXRα is post-translationally modified by O-linked β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) with increased transcriptional activity. Moreover, we showed that LXRα associates with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in vitro and in vivo in mouse liver. In this study, we report that human LXRα is O-GlcNAc modified in its N-terminal domain (NTD) by identifying a specific O-GlcNAc site S49 and a novel O-GlcNAc modified peptide 20LWKPGAQDASSQAQGGSSCILRE42. However, O-GlcNAc site-mutations did not modulate LXRα transactivation of selected target gene promoters in vitro. Peptide array and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that LXRα interacts with OGT in its NTD and ligand-binding domain (LBD) in a ligand-independent fashion. Moreover, we map two new O-GlcNAc sites in the longest OGT isoform (ncOGT): S437 in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 13 domain and T1043 in the far C-terminus, and a new O-GlcNAc modified peptide (amino acids 826-832) in the intervening region (Int-D) within the catalytic domain. We also map four new O-GlcNAc sites in the short isoform sOGT: S391, T393, S399 and S437 in the TPRs 11-13 domain. Future studies will reveal the biological role of identified O-GlcNAc sites in LXRα and OGT.
Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists inhibit various types of tumor growth and have been applied to preclinical research. In colon cancer cells, LXR agonists induce pyroptotic cell death through the predominant cytoplasmic localisation of LXRβ. In the present study, we determined whether tumor cell death induced by LXR agonists in colon cancer cells could elicit immunogenic cell death (ICD). LXR agonist-treated-colon cancer cells exhibited translocation of calreticulin (CRT) and release of HMGB1 and ATP into the medium. Expression levels of CRT and HMGB1 were also increased in T0901317-treated Balb/c mice. Furthermore, compared with control mice, mice vaccinated with T0901317-treated CT26 cells showed reduced tumor volumes and protection against a challenge with live tumor cells. Inhibition of CRT or HMGB1 expression in CT26 cells abolished this protection in Balb/c mice. In conclusion, the LXR agonist T0901317 induces ICD in colon cancer cells. CRT exposure and HMGB1 release play a critical role in the immunogenicity of this treatment.
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical illness syndrome with high morbidity and mortality in patients. Inflammation has been known to be involved in the development of ALI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of puerarin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β were determined by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used for detecting the expression of NF-κB, IκBα, and LXRα. And myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, and histopathological examination were also detected in lung tissues. The results showed that puerarin significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated MPO activity in lung tissues. Meanwhile, puerarin attenuated lung histopathological changes and lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio. We also found that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β were inhibited by puerarin. Puerarin also inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells and IL-8 in A549 cells. From the results of western blotting, puerarin significantly suppressed LPS-stimulated NF-κB activation. And the expression of LXRα was dose-dependently increased by treatment of puerarin. The inhibition of puerarin on TNF-α production in RAW264.7 cells and IL-8 production in A549 cells were blocked by LXRα inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). These results suggested that puerarin attenuated ALI by activating LXRα, which subsequently inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are involved in maintaining epidermal barrier and suppressing inflammatory responses in model systems. The LXR agonist VTP-38543 showed promising results in improving barrier function and inflammatory responses in model systems.
To assess the safety, tolerability, cellular and molecular changes, and clinical efficacy of the topical VTP-38543 in adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).
A total of 104 ambulatory patients with mild to moderate AD were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial between December 2015 and September 2016. VTP-38543 cream in 3 concentrations (0.05%, 0.15%, and 1.0%) or placebo was applied twice daily for 28 days. Pretreatment and posttreatment skin biopsy specimens were obtained from a subset of 33 patients. Changes in SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis, Eczema Area and Severity Index, Investigator's Global Assessment, and tissue biomarkers (by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining) were evaluated.
Topical VTP-38543 was safe and well tolerated. VTP-38543 significantly increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of epidermal barrier differentiation (loricrin and filaggrin, P = .02) and lipid (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, P &lt; .01) measures and reduced epidermal hyperplasia markers (thickness, keratin 16 mRNA). VTP-38543 nonsignificantly suppressed cellular infiltrates and down-regulated mRNA expression of several TH17/TH22-related (phosphatidylinositol 3, S100 calcium-binding protein A12) and innate immunity (interleukin 6) markers.
Topical VTP-38543 is safe and well tolerated. Its application led to improvement in barrier differentiation and lipids. Longer-term studies are needed to clarify whether a barrier-based approach can induce meaningful suppression of immune abnormalities.
clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02655679.
Obese patients, often accompanied by hyperleptinemia, are prone to liver fibrogenesis. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone and plays a promotion role in liver fibrosis. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) exerts a crucial role in inhibiting hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, a key step in liver fibrogenesis. Our previous studies indicated that leptin inhibited SREBP1c expression, contributing to leptin-induced HSC activation and liver fibrosis. microRNAs (miR) have emerged as important layers of regulatory control and regulate gene expression, and are implicated in numerous diseases. The present study revealed leptin up-regulation of miR-27a/b-3p levels in HSCs in vitro and in vivo. Three signaling pathways were required for leptin regulation of miR-27a/b-3p levels. miR-27a/b-3p could reduce SREBP1c and liver x receptor α (LXRα) levels, increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, a marker for HSC activation) and α1(I)collagen levels in cultured HSCs. miR-27a/b-3p regulation of SREBP1c and LXRα were independent of 3'-untranslated region of SREBP1c and LXRα mRNA. In vivo experiments further demonstrated the miR-27a/b-3p involved in leptin-associated decrease in SREBP1 level in HSCs, HSC activation, and liver fibrosis. These data might have potential implications for our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying leptin roles in liver fibrogenesis of obese patients with hyperleptinaemia.
Amyloid beta (Aβ) formation is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), further leading to the alteration of several signalling pathways. In the present study, vitexin has been evaluated for its neuroprotective activity against Aβ25-35 induced toxicity in Neuro-2a cells. Results of cell free studies indicated that vitexin significantly inhibited the aggregation of Aβ25-35. Studies in Neuro-2a cells revealed that Aβ25-35 significantly affected the cell viability by inducing ROS mediated toxicity and apoptosis. However, pre-treatment of Neuro-2a cells with vitexin (50 μM) significantly restored the cell viability up to 92.86 ± 5.57%. Vitexin has been found to inhibit the production of free radicals and suppress ROS mediated lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and loss of membrane potential. Also, vitexin modulated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant response mechanisms (Nrf-2, HO-1), cholesterol metabolism (LXR-α, APOE, ABCA-1, Seladin-1), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Grp78, Gadd153) to offer neuroprotection. Aβ25-35 induced caspase-3 activation, and Bax protein expression was also found to be significantly inhibited by vitexin. Taken together, our results indicate that vitexin offers neuroprotection to cells in part via augmenting the antioxidant mechanisms, maintaining lipid homeostasis and inhibiting apoptosis induced by Aβ.
Cholesterol is an important lipid for maintaining cell membrane fluidity and generation of various hormones and bile acids. Thus, it is critical to maintain cholesterol homeostasis including absorption, trafficking, biosynthesis, and efflux; dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis may lead to human disorders such as atherosclerosis. As a cholesterol sensor, nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) is an important factor regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Extensive research has been carried out to examine the roles of LXR in atherosclerosis. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms how LXR regulates cholesterol synthesis, efflux, absorption, and conversion of cholesterol esters to cholesterol in the context of atherosclerosis. In addition, we also discuss the possibility of targeting LXR and cholesterol homeostasis as a potential interventional strategy for treating atherosclerosis.
The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a laminated brain region in which neurogenesis begins during early embryonic development and continues until adulthood. Recent studies have implicated that defects in the neurogenesis of the DG seem to be involved in the genesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)-like behaviors. Liver X receptor β (LXRβ) has recently emerged as an important transcription factor involved in the development of laminated CNS structures, but little is known about its role in the development of the DG. Here, we show that deletion of the LXRβ in mice causes hypoplasia in the DG, including abnormalities in the formation of progenitor cells and granule cell differentiation. We also found that expression of Notch1, a central mediator of progenitor cell self-renewal, is reduced in LXRβ-null mice. In addition, LXRβ deletion in mice results in autistic-like behaviors, including abnormal social interaction and repetitive behavior. These data reveal a central role for LXRβ in orchestrating the timely differentiation of neural progenitor cells within the DG, thereby providing a likely explanation for its association with the genesis of autism-related behaviors in LXRβ-deficient mice.
Liver X Receptors (LXRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, have been reported that activation of LXRs with synthetic ligands has anti-inflammatory effects in various inflammatory diseases. This study aims at investigating the effects of T0901317 (T0), a synthetic LXRs ligand, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs). BMECs were stimulated by LPS in the presence or absence of T0. The results showed that treatment with T0 significantly inhibited LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. LPS-induced NF-κB activation was also suppressed by T0. Furthermore, T0 was found to inhibit the translocation of TLR4 to lipid rafts. T0 could activate ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) dependent pathway which induced cholesterol efflux from cells and disrupted the formation of lipid rafts. Thus, based on those findings we proposed that LXRs agonist might become a novel therapeutic target for inflammation.
The generation of CD138+ phagocytic macrophages with an alternative (M2) phenotype that clear apoptotic cells from tissues is defective in lupus. Liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) is an oxysterol-regulated transcription factor that promotes reverse cholesterol transport and alternative (M2) macrophage activation. Conversely, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1α) promotes classical (M1) macrophage activation. The objective of this study was to see if lupus can be treated by enhancing the generation of M2-like macrophages using LXR agonists. Peritoneal macrophages from pristane-treated mice had an M1 phenotype, high HIFα-regulated phosphofructokinase and TNFα expression (quantitative PCR, flow cytometry), and low expression of the LXRα-regulated gene ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (Abca1) and Il10 vs. mice treated with mineral oil, a control inflammatory oil that does not cause lupus. Glycolytic metabolism (extracellular flux assays) and Hif1a expression were higher in pristane-treated mice (M1-like) whereas oxidative metabolism and LXRα expression were higher in mineral oil-treated mice (M2-like). Similarly, lupus patients' monocytes exhibited low LXRα/ABCA1 and high HIF1α vs.
The LXR agonist T0901317 inhibited type I interferon and increased ABCA1 in lupus patients' monocytes and in murine peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, T0901317 induced M2-like macrophage polarization and protected mice from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), an often fatal complication of lupus. We conclude that end-organ damage (DAH) in murine lupus can be prevented using an LXR agonist to correct a macrophage differentiation abnormality characteristic of lupus. LXR agonists also decrease inflammatory cytokine production by human lupus monocytes, suggesting that these agents may be have a role in the pharmacotherapy of lupus.
Liver X receptor (LXR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, mainly serves as a reverse cholesterol transporter in lipid metabolism. It has been demonstrated that LXR is a promising target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. LXR is also involved in cancer metabolism, glucose homeostasis, immunity, and various physiological processes. The antitumor function of LXR has become of great interest to researchers in recent years. However, while it is believed that activating LXR with small molecules could be a promising approach to cancer treatment, effective drugs that target LXR are yet to be reported. To find compounds that are potentially capable of activating LXR, we utilized a high-throughput screening method to search the MolMall database for suitable compounds. Seven candidates with lower GB/SA Hawkins scores than the reference ligand T0901317 were identified. Based on the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy analysis, and an analysis of the agonism mechanism, ZINC90512020 and ZINC3845032 were predicted to have high affinities for LXR and high relative stabilization, and were therefore selected as potential LXR agonists. Both of these compounds will undergo further development with a view to utilizing them for the treatment of LXR-related cardiovascular diseases or cancers.
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), a leading cause of various cerebrovascular diseases, leads to cognitive dysfunction due to neuron loss and impaired neurogenesis. Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRα and LXRβ isoforms, are crucial for cholesterol metabolism, synaptic plasticity as well as neurogenesis. However, it is not clear the potential roles of LXRs in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment induced by CCH. In this study, we demonstrated that LXRβ expression decreased in hippocampus of CCH mice. GW3965, a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRα and LXRβ, ameliorated impairment of learning and memory in CCH mice by promoting neuronal survival and neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation in dentate gyrus (DG) of CCH mice. The proliferative effects of GW3965 were further confirmed in cultured neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and showed in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, GW3965 phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) at Ser473 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in NPCs. Furthermore, both LY294002, an inhibitor for phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and short hairpin RNAs for LXRβ knockdown, abrogated GW3965-induced Akt phosphorylation, and therefore abolished GW3965-mediated proliferation-promoting of NPCs. All the data suggested that GW3965 ameliorated impaired cognitive functions in CCH by promoting NSC proliferation through PI3K/Akt pathway followed LXRβ activation. This study correlates a deficit of LXRβ in cognitive dysfunction in CCH with impaired neurogenesis in hippocampus, and LXRs may serve as a potential therapeutic target for chronic cerebral ischemia.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has shown an increasing morbidity in recent years. Here, we demonstrated that siphonaxanthin (SPX), a rare marine carotenoid, exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on aggravated hepatic lipogenesis in vitro and would be a promising candidate in the prevention and alleviation of NAFLD in the future. In this study, we conducted a preliminary assessment of the effect of SPX on hepatic lipogenesis by using the HepG2 cell line, derived from human liver cancer, as a model of the liver. SPX significantly suppressed the excess accumulation of triacylglycerol induced by liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonist by downregulating a nuclear transcription factor named sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and a set of related genes. Moreover, fatty acid translocase (CD36) and fatty acid-binding protein-1, which regulates fatty acid uptake, also exhibited significant decrease in transcriptional levels. Furthermore, we found that SPX blocked LXRα activation and would be a promising candidate for antagonist of LXRα.
O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) expression is increased in various cancer types, indicating the potential importance of O-GlcNAcylation in tumorigenesis. Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is involved in cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance, and recently, liver X receptors (LXRs) and sterol response element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) were reported to regulate sCLU transcription. Here, we found that sCLU is significantly increased in cervical cancer cell lines, which have higher expression levels of O-GlcNAc and OGT than keratinocytes. OGT knockdown decreased expression of LXRs, SREBP-1 and sCLU through hypo-O-GlcNAcylation of LXRs. Additionally, treatment with Thiamet G, O-GlcNAcase OGA inhibitor, increased expression of O-GlcNAcylation and sCLU, and high glucose increased levels of LXRs, SREBP-1 and sCLU in HeLa cells. Moreover, OGT knockdown induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and late apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells, and decreased viability compared to OGT intact HeLa cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that OGT, O-GlcNAcylated LXRs, and SREBP-1 increase sCLU expression in cervical cancer cells, which contributes to drug resistance.
The Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor family, that play fundamental roles in cholesterol transport, lipid metabolism and modulation of inflammatory responses. In recent years, the synthetic steroid N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) arised as a promising LXR ligand. This compound was able to dissociate certain beneficial LXRs effects from those undesirable ones involved in triglyceride metabolism. Here, we synthetized a series of DMHCA analogues with different modifications in the steroidal nucleus involving the A/B ring fusion, that generate changes in the overall conformation of the steroid. The LXRα and LXRβ activity of these analogues was evaluated by using a luciferase reporter assay in BHK21 cells. Compounds were tested in both the agonist and antagonist modes. Results indicated that the agonist/antagonist profile is dependent on the steroid configuration at the A/B ring junction. Notably, in contrast to DMHCA, the amide derived from lithocholic acid (2) with an A/B cis configuration and its 6,19-epoxy analogue 4 behaved as LXRα selective agonists, while the 2,19-epoxy analogues with an A/B trans configuration were antagonists of both isoforms. The binding mode of the analogues to both LXR isoforms was assessed by using 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results revealed conformational differences between LXRα- and LXRβ-ligand complexes, mainly in the hydrogen bonding network that involves the C-3 hydroxyl. Overall, these results indicate that the synthetized DMHCA analogues could be interesting candidates for a therapeutic modulation of the LXRs.
Dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) maybe a valuable source for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson disease. Recent studies showed that new functions of LXR and their ligands have been proposed to prevent PD in the adult nervous system. The present study was designed to observe the effect of liver X receptors (LXR) agonist on differentiation of rat BMSCs into DA neurons. Expressions of the neuronal markers (Tuj1 and Nestin), the specific marker of DA neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH), LXR α and LXR β were measured by immunocytochemical assay and TH/Tuj1 positive cells were determined by quantitative cell count analyses. mRNA expressions of LXR α, LXR β, TH, DAT, Nurr1, Pitx3, En1 and Lmx1b were measured by qPCR. Compared with growth factors (GF) treated group, combined use of LXR and GF induced rat BMSCs to TH-expressing cells with 87.42% of efficiency in 6 days of period of induction. LXR agonist alone did not induce the differentiation. Compared with GF alone, combined use of LXR and GF increased expressions of LXR α and LXR β protein and mRNA and TH, DAT, Nurr1, and Pitx3 mRNA, decreased expressions of En1 and Lmx1b mRNA. Our experimental results indicated that LXR activation leads to improve induction efficiency and shorten induction period of rat BMSCs into DA neuron-like cells through regulating DA development-related genes expressions and that LXR can be considered as a candidate target for drug development to improve differentiation of BMSCs into DA neurons.
Dendrogenin A (DDA) is a mammalian cholesterol metabolite recently identified that displays tumor suppressor properties. The discovery of DDA has revealed the existence in mammals of a new metabolic branch in the cholesterol pathway centered on 5,6α-epoxycholesterol and bridging cholesterol metabolism with histamine metabolism. Metabolic studies showed a drop in DDA levels in cancer cells and tumors compared to normal cells, suggesting a link between DDA metabolism deregulation and oncogenesis. Importantly, complementation of cancer cells with DDA induced 1) cancer cell re-differentiation, 2) blockade of 6-oxo-cholestan-3β,5α-diol (OCDO) production, an endogenous tumor promoter and 3) lethal autophagy in tumors. Importantly, by binding the liver X receptor (LXR), DDA activates the expression of genes controlling autophagy. These genes include NR4A1, NR4A3, LC3 and TFEB. The canonical LXR ligands 22(R)hydroxycholesterol, TO901317 and GW3965 did not induce these effects indicating that DDA delineates a new class of selective LXR modulator (SLiM). The induction of lethal autophagy by DDA was associated with the accumulation in cancer cells of lysosomes and of the pro-lysosomal cholesterol precursor zymostenol due to the inhibition of the 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8Δ7-isomerase enzyme (D8D7I). The anti-cancer efficacy of DDA was established on different mouse and human cancers such as breast cancers, melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia, including patient derived xenografts, and did not discriminate bulk cancer cells from cancer cell progenitors. Together these data highlight that the mammalian metabolite DDA is a promising anticancer compound with a broad range of anticancer applications. In addition, DDA and LXR are new actors in the transcriptional control of autophagy and DDA being a "first in line" driver of lethal autophagy in cancers via the LXR.
A novel marine bacterium, designated strain KMM 6171(T), was subjected to taxonomic analysis by using a polyphasic approach. Colonies were yellow-pigmented and cells were Gram-negative, heterotrophic rods displaying slow gliding motility. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain KMM 6171(T) was closely related to the genus Algibacter, a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae, with sequence similarity of 96.7-96.8 %. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 1, iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 3-OH, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and summed feature 3, comprising C16 : 1omega7c and/or iso-C15 : 0 2-OH. The DNA G+C content was 35.1 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic, genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain KMM 6171(T) represents a novel species of the genus Algibacter, for which the name Algibacter mikhailovii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 6171(T) (=KCTC 12710(T)=LMG 23988(T)). An emended description of the genus Algibacter based on the new data is also given.
Members of the 70 kD heat-shock gene family are highly conserved across a wide range of organisms. In an effort to learn more about the evolution and possible functions of extreme environment plant Saussurea medusa Maxim hsp70, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a putative cytosolic member (Smhsp70) of this family of proteins from a cDNA library of S. medusa cell cultures. The cDNA clone was 2224 bp in length and contained a 1941 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 647 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 70,794 Da. The predicted protein was found to contain a C-terminal amino acid motif of "PKIEEVD" indicating that Smhsp70 was related to cytosolic members of the hsp70 family in higher plant. The secondary and three-dimensional structures of Smhsp70 were analyzed by molecular modeling. The genomic structure of Smhsp70 included one intron of 1134 bp in length. The deduced Smhsp70 protein has 93.7 and 93.2% similarity with the hsp70 of tobacco and tomato, 73.2% with the hsp70 of human, and 43.7% with DnaK of Escherichia. coli, respectively. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses indicated that the cytosolic Smhsp70 protein was constitutively expressed and markedly increased after relatively short periods of heat shock (37 degrees C) as well as by low temperature (4 degree C) treatments.
Two marine, heterotrophic, aerobic, yellow-pigmented, agarolytic bacterial strains that are motile by means of gliding were isolated from the green alga Acrosiphonia sonderi and from sea water. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed an affiliation between the strains studied and the genus Formosa, a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae. The level of sequence similarity between strain KMM 3901T and Formosa algae KMM 3553T was 99.1 %. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and phenotypic analysis indicated that the strains represent a novel species of the genus Formosa, for which the name Formosa agariphila sp. nov. is proposed, with KMM 3901T (= KCTC 12365T = LMG 23005T = DSM 15362T) as the type strain. The description of the genus Formosa is emended with newly obtained data.
A novel marine bacterium isolated from the soft coral Paragorgia arborea in the Sea of Okhotsk was studied by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The strain, KMM 6029T, was strictly aerobic, heterotrophic, yellow-pigmented, non-motile by gliding, Gram-negative and oxidase-, catalase- and alkaline phosphatase-positive. From results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain KMM 6029T occupied a distinct lineage within the family Flavobacteriaceae and showed 95.5 % similarity to its closest relative, Formosa algae. The DNA G+C content was 37.6 mol%. Major respiratory quinone was MK-6. The predominant fatty acids were i15 : 0, a15 : 0, i15 : 1, a15 : 1, i16 : 1, i16 : 0, i16 : 0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (i15 : 0 2-OH and/or 16 : 1omega7c). On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics the novel bacterium has been assigned to Bizionia gen. nov., as Bizionia paragorgiae gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is KMM 6029T (=KCTC 12304T=LMG 22571T).
beta-Catenins function both in cell adhesion as part of the cadherin/catenin complex and in Wnt signal transduction as transcription factors. Vertebrates express two related proteins, beta-catenin and plakoglobin, while Drosophila has a single family member, Armadillo. Caenorhabditis elegans expresses three beta-catenin-related proteins, BAR-1, HMP-2, and WRM-1, which are quite diverged in sequence from each other and other beta-catenins. While BAR-1 and WRM-1 are known to act in Wnt-mediated processes, and HMP-2 acts in a complex with cadherin/alpha-catenin homologs, it is unclear whether all three proteins retain the other functions of beta-catenin. Here we show that BAR-1, like vertebrate beta-catenin, has redundant transcription activation domains in its amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions but that HMP-2 and WRM-1 also possess the ability to activate transcription. We show via yeast two-hybrid analysis that these three proteins display distinct patterns of protein interactions. Surprisingly, we find that both WRM-1 and HMP-2 can substitute for BAR-1 in C. elegans when expressed from the bar-1 promoter. Therefore, although their mutant phenotypes and protein interaction patterns strongly suggest that the functions of beta-catenin in other species have been segregated among three diverged proteins in C. elegans, these proteins still retain sufficient similarity to display functional redundancy in vivo.
The association of pollinosis with allergy to plant foods occurs in up to 70% of tree pollen-allergic patients. In recent years, some of the relevant cross-reacting proteins have been characterized at the molecular and immunological level. Api g 1 has been identified as the celery homologue of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. Although a number of Bet v 1 isoforms have been characterized from birch pollen, little is known about isoforms of food allergens and their allergenic features.
Api g 1.0201, an isoform of Api g 1, was isolated from a cDNA library, cloned and sequenced. The cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant protein was tested in immunoblots.
Api g 1.0201 displays 72% sequence similarity to the previously identified Api g 1.0101 and consists of 159 amino acid residues. The sequence of Api g 1.0201 has five additional amino acid residues at the carboxy-terminus as compared to Api g 1.0101. Purified recombinant Api g 1.0201 is recognized by IgE from the sera of celery-allergic patients, as well as by the murine monoclonal anti-Bet v 1 antibody. In general, this isoform displays a weaker IgE-binding capacity than Api g 1.0101, as concluded from immunoblotting experiments. Results from inhibition assays revealed that IgE-binding to Api g 1.0201 is only slightly reduced by preincubation with either purified recombinant Api g 1.0101 or purified recombinant Bet v 1a. Total inhibition was only achieved when using purified natural Bet v 1.
At present, little is known about the IgE-binding capacity of isoforms of Bet v 1 homologues of food allergens. Identification and characterization of such isoforms may help to contribute to a better understanding of food allergy and the observed cross-reactivity to pollen allergy.
We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel orphan nuclear receptor, aDOR1, closely related to testicular receptor-2 (TR2) orphan receptor family members, from neurulating Ambystoma mexicanum embryos. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein primary sequence of 416 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 45.8 kDa. While the DNA-binding domains of aDOR1 and hTR2-11 share 96% identity, considerable divergence is observed at both extremities of the peptides. At the N-terminus, aDOR1 is 66% identical to hTR2-11 and longer by 37 amino acids. At the C-terminus, despite a greater similarity (69%), aDOR1 is much shorter than the hTR2 isoforms and seems to encode a distinct ligand-binding domain. Expression of aDOR1 was studied by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). High mRNA levels were detected during oogenesis, they remained high during the cleavage stage, and decreased at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). Transcripts increased again at the end of gastrulation, reached a peak level during neurulation, and leveled off after closure of the neural tube. In neurulas dissected along the anteroposterior axis, aDOR1 mRNA was enriched at both extremities of the embryo, while no particular distribution was favored along the dorsoventral axis. Retinoic acid (RA) treatments at the beginning of gastrulation did not affect overall mRNA levels in the neurula nor its distribution along both axes. In the adult, expression was predominant in the brain; lower levels (about 15%) were detectable in all germ layer derivatives, except muscle. These results suggest that aDOR1 may be required for the early determination events occurring during the cleavage stages of development, and may be involved in embryogenesis and in brain function.
The human leukocyte Ag CD38 is a 45-kDa type II membrane glycoprotein that functions both as a transmembrane signaling receptor and as an ectoenzyme. CD38 can transmit positive or negative signals regulating T and B lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation and can enzymatically convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to cyclic ADP-ribose, a potent intracellular calcium releaser. To begin the genetic analysis of CD38, we have isolated and characterized the human CD38 gene, previously mapped to chromosome 4. Human CD38 is encoded by a single copy gene that extends over &gt; 62 kb and consists of eight exons and seven introns, including a very long intron that interrupts the 5' coding region. The 5' upstream region of the gene is characterized by the absence of canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, the presence of a GC-rich tract immediately upstream of the initiator codon, several transcription start sites, and potential binding sites for the immunologic transcription factors T cell-specific transcription factor alpha, nuclear factor-IL-6, and interferon responsive factor-1. Comparison of the genomic structure of human CD38 with that of the genes for murine bone marrow stromal Ag bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1/BP-3 and aplysian ADP-ribosyl cyclase, which encode proteins related to CD38 in sequence and function, reveals their striking structural similarity. This strongly suggests that the three genes evolved from a common ancestor from which CD38 and bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1 arose by gene duplication before the divergence of humans and rodents.
Chemokines are a group of small, homologous proteins that regulate leukocyte migration, hemopoiesis, and HIV-1 absorption. We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel murine and human C-C chemokine termed Exodus-2 for its similarity to Exodus-1/MIP-3alpha/LARC, and its chemotactic ability. This novel chemokine has a unique 36 or 37 (murine and human, respectively) amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension not seen in any other chemokine family member. Purified recombinant Exodus-2 was found to have two activities classically associated with chemokines: inhibiting hemopoiesis and stimulating chemotaxis. However, Exodus-2 also had unusual characteristics for C-C chemokines. It selectively stimulated the chemotaxis of T-lymphocytes and was preferentially expressed in lymph node tissue. The combination of these characteristics may be a functional correlate for the unique carboxyl-terminal structure of Exodus-2.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a well-characterized, essential member of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones, Kar2p. Kar2p has been shown to be involved in the translocation of proteins into the ER as well as the proper folding of proteins in that compartment. We report the characterization of a novel Hsp70 of the ER, Ssi1p. Ssi1p, which shares 24% of the amino acids of Kar2p, is not essential for growth under normal conditions. However, deletion of SSI1 results in cold sensitivity as well as enhanced resistance to manganese. The localization of Ssi1p to the ER, suggested by the presence of a conserved S. cerevisiae ER retention signal at its C terminus, was confirmed by subcellular fractionation, protease protection assays, and immunofluorescence. The SSI1 promoter contains an element with similarity to the unfolded protein response element of KAR2. Like KAR2, SSI1 is induced both in the presence of tunicamycin and in a kar2-159 mutant strain, conditions which lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Unlike KAR2, however, SSI1 is not induced by heat shock. Deletion of SSI1 shows a complex pattern of genetic interactions with various conditional alleles of KAR2, ranging from synthetic lethality to synthetic rescue. Interestingly, SSI1 deletion strains show a partial block in translocation of multiple proteins into the ER, suggesting that Ssi1p plays a direct role in the translocation process.
We describe the characterization of axi 1, a tobacco gene isolated by activation T-DNA tagging which apparently plays a role in auxin action. Upon deregulated expression, axi 1 confers on protoplasts the ability to grow in culture not only in the absence of auxin but also in high auxin concentrations where maximal frequencies of cell division are not observed in wild-type protoplasts. In wild-type plants axi 1 is transcribed principally in root tissue. In the tagged plant line, axi 159, axi 1 RNA can be detected in all tissues tested. Freshly isolated wild-type protoplasts require auxin for the accumulation of detectable levels of axi 1 transcript and this precedes maximal levels of cell division. In contrast, axi 1 RNA appears in protoplasts isolated from axi 159 plants in the absence of auxin. axi 1 was localized to 6.2 kb of plant genomic DNA flanking the right T-DNA border sequence. axi 1 is interrupted by nine introns and in tobacco it is a member of a small gene family. Database searching reveals no similarity within the coding region with other genes. Sequences within the fourth intron are similar to those located in the non-coding regions of other plant genes, some of which are known to be auxin inducible. A DNA fragment containing the conserved sequence acts as an auxin responsive element in transient expression assays in wild-type protoplasts and this response is higher in axi 159 protoplasts. This suggests that auxin induced axi 1 expression may be mediated by a region contained within an intron sequence and that the axi 1 product might play a role in this induction.
Cystatin-related proteins (CRPs) are abundant androgen-regulated secretory glycoproteins that are specifically synthesized in the ventral prostate and lachrymal gland of the rat. Two complete 6-kb genes, Crp1 and Crp2, have been cloned and characterized. They are differentially expressed and encode slightly different proteins. The genes each contain four exons which are interrupted by large introns. An alignment of their sequences demonstrates an overall homology of 90%. The 3' end of a third gene, Crp3, from which only a 1.5-kb fragment was isolated, displays a sequence identity of 84%. These data indicate the existence of a Crp multigene family. The 5' flanking regions of Crp1 and Crp2 are highly homologous and contain a GATAAA sequence 29 nt upstream from the transcription start point. This TATA-box-like element is also found in the promoters of the genes encoding cystatin type-2 proteins. No other recognizable transcription control elements can be detected. Potential binding sites (ARE) for the androgen receptor are scattered throughout the entire genes. The exon/intron organization of the genes encoding CRPs, the size of the exons and their encoding amino acid sequences exhibiting a characteristic spacing of the Cys residues are structural elements displaying a remarkable similarity with the corresponding elements in the genes encoding cystatin type-2 proteins. CRPs must therefore belong to the cystatin superfamily. However, due to their additional domain encoded in an extra exon 2, CRPs must be classified as a new family, type 5.
The taxonomic status of a novel, heterotrophic, strictly aerobic, gliding and yellow-orange-pigmented bacterium (strain KMM 6264(T)), associated with the coral Palythoa, was determined. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain KMM 6264(T) clustered with the recognized species of the genus Leeuwenhoekiella of the family Flavobacteriaceae with 96.4-98.2 % sequence similarity. DNA-DNA reassociation levels between the isolate and the type strains of Leeuwenhoekiella species were 15-22 %. The DNA G+C content was 41.2 mol%. The phylogenetic evidence and the results of genomic and phenotypic analyses showed that the isolate should be classified as a member of a novel species of the genus Leeuwenhoekiella, for which the name Leeuwenhoekiella palythoae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 6264(T) (=KCTC 22020(T)=LMG 24856(T)).
To identify Bombyx mori genes involved in the early response to injury and microbial challenge, we performed genome-wide gene expression-profiling experiments using oligonucleotide DNA microarrays. Of approximately 23,000 genes examined, 465 displayed changes in mRNA expression levels. Of these, 306 were induced and 159 were repressed in response to injury (injection with phosphate buffer saline) or challenges by Gram-negative (Serratia marcescens), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), or fungus (Beauveria bassiana). Many of these differentially expressed genes can be assigned to specific functional groups of the innate immune response, including recognition, signaling, melanization and coagulation, and antimicrobial peptides. Seventeen percent of differentially expressed genes encode proteins with no obvious similarity to known functional domains. Of particular interest is a member of the juvenile hormone-binding protein family, which was highly induced by both injury and microbial challenges. The possible role of juvenile hormone in innate immunity is discussed.
The taxonomic position of a novel marine, yellow-pigmented bacterium, designated strain KMM 6211(T), was examined by using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain KMM 6211(T) is a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylum Bacteroidetes. The closest relative of strain KMM 6211(T) was Winogradskyella eximia KMM 3944(T), the sequence similarity being 97.1 %. The DNA G+C content of KMM 6211(T) was 33.6 mol%. The strain was motile by gliding and grew with 1-6 % NaCl and at 4-37 degrees C. Aesculin, casein and gelatin were hydrolysed, but agar, starch, DNA and chitin were not degraded. On the basis of phylogenetic data and phenotypic differences between the isolate and recognized Winogradskyella species, strain KMM 6211(T) represents a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella echinorum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 6211(T) (=KCTC 22026(T)=LMG 24757(T)).
An aerobic, Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, gliding bacterial strain, designated R60(T), was isolated from a marine sediment sample obtained from the Sea of Japan and was characterized by using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain R60(T) belonged to the genus Winogradskyella, sharing &lt;97 % sequence similarity with the type strains of recognized Winogradskyella species. The main fatty acids of strain R60(T) were iso-C(15 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(16 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH, anteiso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and iso-C(15 : 0), consistent with its assignment to the genus Winogradskyella. On the basis of phenotypic distinctiveness and phylogenetic divergence, strain R60(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Winogradskyella, for which the name Winogradskyella arenosi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is R60(T) (=KMM 3968(T) =NRIC 0748(T)= JCM 15527(T)).
This introductory paper describes the basic principles and clinical applications of the protein 3D structure prediction by homology modelling. The paper mainly addresses physicians and medical chemists. Because many proteins are of immediate clinical importance, the determination of their structures is crucial for molecular medicine. In homology modelling, a protein sequence with unknown structure is aligned with sequences of known protein structures. By exploiting structural information from the known configurations, the new structure can be predicted. The necessary condition for successful homology modelling is a sufficient similarity between the protein sequences. Because in the near future for every protein family at least one member with a known structure will be available, the importance and applicability of homology modelling is steadily increasing. We demonstrate the principles of homology modelling on hand of the Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD 65) structure prediction, which is a typical autoantigen involved in Diabetes Mellitus Type 1.
Two marine, heterotrophic, aerobic, pigmented and gliding bacteria, isolated from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomy study. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strains KMM 6032T and KMM 6047 formed a distinct branch within the genus Arenibacter, a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae. The level of sequence similarity between the novel isolates and members of the genus Arenibacter was 94.5-98.9%. The DNA G+C content was 39-40 mol%. The dominant fatty acids were iso-C15:1, iso-C15:0, C15:0, C15:1omega6c, iso-C15:0 3-OH, iso-C17:1omega9c, iso-C17:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1omega7c). The results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments supported by phenotypic data indicated that the isolates represent a novel species within the genus Arenibacter, for which the name Arenibacter echinorum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 6032T (=KCTC 22013T=LMG 22574T).
A Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, motile by gliding and yellow-pigmented bacterium, designated strain 10Alg 139T, was isolated from the Pacific red alga Ahnfeltiato buchiensis. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the novel strain belonged to the genus Polaribacter, a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae, the phylum Bacteroidetes, with highest sequence similarity to Polaribacter butkevichii KMM 3938T (99.3 %) and 93.3-98.6 % to other recognized Polaribacter species. The prevalent fatty acids of strain 10Alg 139T were iso-C15 : 0 3-OH, C15 : 0 3-OH, iso-C15:0, iso-C13 : 0, C15 : 0 and C15 : 1ω6c. The polar lipid profile consisted of the major lipids phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids and four unidentified lipids. The main respiratory quinone was menaquinone 6. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 31.8 mol%. The new isolate and the type strains of recognized species of the genus Polaribacter were readily distinguished based on a number of phenotypic characteristics. A combination of the genotypic and phenotypic data showed that the isolate from alga represents a novel species of the genus Polaribacter, for which the name Polaribacterstaleyi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 10Alg 139T (=KCTC 52773T=KMM 6729T).
Escherichia coli is an important opportunistic pathogen. It can cause sepsis and severe infection. The application of lytic bacteriophages to treat infectious diseases is an alternative to antibiotics. A lytic Escherichia coli phage, designated IME-EC2, was isolated from hospital sewage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that IME-EC2 to be a member of the family Podoviridae. It had a 60-nm head and a 15-nm tail. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of this phage, which consists of 41,510 bp with an overall G+C content of 59.2 %. A total of 60 coding sequences (CDS) were identified, and the phage genome does not contain any tRNA genes. Forty percent of the unknown CDSs are unique to IME-EC2. This phage does not show significant similarity to other phages at the DNA level, which suggests that IME-EC2 could be a novel phage. One of the unique features identified in the IME-EC2 genome was a gene coding for a putative colanic-acid-degrading protein, which could allow the phage to degrade bacterial capsule and biofilms. Another unique feature is that IME-EC2 does not contain a terminase small subunit, which suggests that this phage may have a unique packaging mechanism. The present work provides novel information on phages and shows that this lytic phage or its products could be exploited to destroy bacterial biofilms and pathogenic E. coli.
The genome of the rose yellow leaf virus (RYLV) has been determined to be 3918 nucleotides long and to contain seven open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a 27-kDa peptide (p27). ORF2 shares a common start codon with ORF1 and continues through the amber stop codon of p27 to encode an 87-kDa (p87) protein that has amino acid similarity to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of members of the family Tombusviridae. ORFs 3 and 4 have no significant amino acid similarity to known functional viral ORFs. ORF5 encodes a 6-kDa (p6) protein that has similarity to movement proteins of members of the Tombusviridae. ORF5A has no conventional start codon and overlaps with p6. A putative +1 frameshift mechanism allows p6 translation to continue through the stop codon and results in a 12-kDa protein that has high homology to the carmovirus p13 movement protein. The 37-kDa protein encoded by ORF6 has amino acid sequence similarity to coat proteins (CP) of members of the Tombusviridae. ORF7 has no significant amino acid similarity to known viral ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp amino acid sequences grouped RYLV together with the unclassified Rosa rugosa leaf distortion virus (RrLDV), pelargonium line pattern virus (PLPV), and pelargonium chlorotic ring pattern virus (PCRPV) in a distinct subgroup of the family Tombusviridae.
Here, we report the first genome sequence of a new virulent phage of Microbacterium oxydans, termed vB_MoxS-ISF9, which was isolated from sewage. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the isolated phage, which has a hexagonal head of about 80 nm in diameter and a long non-contractile tail of about 240 nm, belongs to the family Siphoviridae. The vB_MoxS-ISF9 DNA was completely sequenced and found to be 59,254 bp in length, with a G+C content of 62.76% and 120 putative open reading frames (ORFs). The predicted protein products of the ORFs were identified, and their sequences were analyzed. In a comparison with all available phage genomes, vB_MoxS-ISF9 did not show any significant similarity to other previously reported bacteriophages. To the beast of our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation and complete genomic sequencing of a virulent phage against a member of the genus Microbacterium.
φEf11 is a temperate Siphoviridae bacteriophage isolated by induction from a lysogenic Enterococcus faecalis strain. The φEf11 DNA was completely sequenced and found to be 42,822 bp in length, with a G+C mol% of 34.4%. Genome analysis revealed 65 ORFs, accounting for 92.8% of the DNA content. All except for seven of the ORFs displayed sequence similarities to previously characterized proteins. The genes were arranged in functional modules, organized similar to that of several other phages of low GC Gram-positive bacteria; however, the number and arrangement of lysis-related genes were atypical of these bacteriophages. A 159 bp noncoding region between predicted cI and cro genes is highly similar to the functionally characterized early promoter region of lactococcal temperate phage TP901-1, and possessed a predicted stem-loop structure in between predicted P(L) and P(R) promoters, suggesting a novel mechanism of repression of these two bacteriophages from the λ paradigm. Comparison with all available phage and predicted prophage genomes revealed that the φEf11 genome displays unique features, suggesting that φEf11 may be a novel member of a larger family of temperate prophages that also includes lactococcal phages. Trees based on the blast score ratio grouped this family by tail fiber similarity, suggesting that these trees are useful for identifying phages with similar tail fibers.
A bacterial strain, designated KMM 6177(T), was isolated from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic investigation. The bacterium was found to be heterotrophic, aerobic, non-motile by gliding and orange-pigmented. Comparative phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing placed the marine isolate in the genus Bizionia, a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae, with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 94.9-98.6 % with recognized Bizionia species. Strain KMM 6177(T) grew at 4-39 degrees C and with 1-8 % NaCl. It produced alkaline phosphatase, catalase and oxidase and hydrolysed aesculin, gelatin, DNA and Tween 20. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 1), iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0) 3-OH, iso-C(17 : 0) 3-OH and a summed feature (comprising iso-C(15 : 0) 2-OH and/or C(16 : 1)omega7c). The DNA G+C content was 34.4 mol%. A combination of phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic data clearly indicated that strain KMM 6177(T) represents a novel species in the genus Bizionia, for which the name Bizionia echini sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 6177(T) (=KCTC 22015(T)=LMG 25220(T)).
The present study aimed to examine the interactive effect of exercise and energy balance on energy expenditure and substrate utilization.
Seven men and 7 women underwent three 2-day experimental protocols in a random order. Each protocol consisted of no exercise (NE), exercise only (EO), or exercise with a matched energy replacement (ER) on day 1 followed by metabolic testing that occurred after a 12-hour overnight fasting on day 2. Both EO and ER involved treadmill running at 60% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) that induced an energy expenditure of ∼ 500 kcal. The replacement meal used in ER contained ∼ 500 kcal made up of 45% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 25% protein. During metabolic testing, oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and rates of carbohydrate (COX) and fat oxidation (FOX) were determined in three successive 15-minute periods including rest and exercise at 50% and 70% VO2max.
No differences in VO2 and HR were found at rest among NE, EO, and ER. However, RER was lower in EO than NE (0.840 ± 0.014 vs 0.889 ± 0.012, p &lt; 0.05), COX (g·min-1) was lower in ER than NE (0.144 ± 0.016 vs 0.197 ± 0.019, p &lt; 0.05), and FOX (g·min-1) was higher in EO or ER than NE (0.054 ± 0.010 or 0.057 ± 0.009 vs 0.034 ± 0.007, p &lt; 0.05). No treatment effects were observed for all variables at either intensity.
This study demonstrates that an exercise of moderate intensity can increase resting fat oxidation even when the exercise-induced energy expenditure is balanced by energy intake. This finding suggests that muscle action is vital in augmenting fat utilization.
The plasma membrane is at the interface of plant-pathogen interactions and thus many bacterial type-III effector proteins (T3Es) target membrane-associated processes to interfere with immunity. The Pseudomonas syringae T3E HopZ1a is a host cell plasma membrane (PM)-localized effector protein that has several immunity associated host targets but also activates effector triggered immunity (ETI) in resistant backgrounds. Although HopZ1a has been shown to interfere with early defense signaling at the PM, no dedicated plasma membrane-associated HopZ1a target protein has been identified until now. We show here, that HopZ1a interacts with the PM-associated remorin protein NbREM4 from Nicotiana benthamiana in several independent assays. NbREM4 re-localizes to membrane sub-nanodomains after treatment with the bacterial elicitor flg22 and transient overexpression of NbREM4 in N. benthamiana induces the expression of a subset of defense related genes. We can further show that NbREM4 interacts with the immune-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBS1 and is phosphorylated by PBS1 on several residues in vitro. Thus, we conclude that NbREM4 is associated with early defense signaling at the PM. The possible relevance of the HopZ1a/NbREM4 interaction for HopZ1a virulence and avirulence functions is discussed.
Ethnicity represents a crucial factor in influencing response to psychotropic drugs. Some data indicate that functional polymorphisms of two candidate genes of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) may affect the response to selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The present study aimed to compare the platelet SERT, through the specific [3H]paroxetine ([3H]Par) binding, and plasma oxytocin (OT) levels in 20 Senegalese and in 20 Italian men.
No subjects had family or personal history of any major psychiatric disorder, or had ever regularly taken psychotropic drugs, or were suffering from any physical illness.
Senegalese men showed statistically significant higher density (Bmax, fmol/mg protein, mean ± SD) of [3H]Par binding sites (2105.00 ± 473.15 vs 1139.85 ± 213.58, P &lt; 0.001), as well as more elevated plasma OT levels (pg/ml, mean ± SD) (OT: 18.08 ± 4.46 vs 6.62 ± 2.91) than Italian men.
These differences, possibly due to genetic or dietary reasons, or even to gender, might affect the response to psychopharmacological compounds. Our findings would suggest specific caution when administering psychotropic compounds to non-European individuals, and the need of further studies in this emerging field of neuropsychopharmacology.
Recent studies from us and others have shown that nanoparticle (NP) exposure could modulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Since ER stress is closely related to lipid droplet biogenesis, in this study, we investigated if multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) might influence lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages through the modulation of ER stress. Exposure to up to 64 μg/mL pristine MWCNTs (p-MWCNTs), hydroxylated MWCNTs (h-MWCNTs), and carboxylated MWCNTs (c-MWCNTs) led to NP internalization, which was associated with a modest increase of cytotoxicity. Oxidative stress was also induced, showing as increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased glutathione. Only h-MWCNTs and c-MWCNTs significantly promoted the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which was significantly higher compared with that after p-MWCNT exposure. All types of MWCNTs significantly induced lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages and more modestly in the co-culture model consisting of 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cells and THP-1 macrophages. MWCNT-induced lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages was decreased modestly by antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine and more effectively by ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid. Moreover, MWCNT exposure promoted the expression of ER stress gene DDIT3 as well as ER stress protein p-chop, whereas the transcription factor XBP-1s was decreased. In addition, the expression of scavenger receptors, namely CD36 and MSR1, was also elevated after MWCNT exposure. In conclusion, this study suggested that MWCNT exposure could promote lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages, which could be related to the modulation of ER stress leading to upregulation of scavenger receptors.
To report a unique case of nivolumab-induced uveitis and the results of a cytokine analysis of an intraocular fluid sample.
A 61-year-old male patient undergoing treatment for renal cell carcinoma with nivolumab presented with bilateral uveitis. Severe anterior uveitis and vitreous opacity coincided with decreased visual acuity only in his left eye. Iris damage was present in this eye because of previous complicated cataract surgery. Vitrectomy was performed to remove the vitreous opacity, and visual acuity recovered postoperatively. A cytokine analysis of an intraocular fluid sample revealed a high level of interleukin-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and interferon-inducible protein-10.
This case indicates that nivolumab-induced uveitis might be more severe in eyes with a damaged iris, and that vitrectomy should be effective for vitreous opacity. A cytokine analysis of the ocular fluid indicated that multiple types of cell might be related to the inflammation process.
Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles (NPs) have a wide number of applications which cause intentional and unintentional exposure to humans, making it important to understand the nano-bio interaction. In this study, we made an attempt to evaluate the toxic effects of Al2O3 NPs chronic exposure on Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were exposed to Al2O3 NPs at concentration 0.1 and 1 mM via ingestion throughout their lifespan and progeny flies were screened for behavioral and phenotypic abnormalities. Behavioral abnormalities in flies were recorded through larval crawling, climbing in flies and two taste testing. Chronic exposure of Al2O3 NPs resulted in the loss of appendages in flies resulting in five legs flies, four legs flies and absence of haltere. Exposure to Al2O3 NPs caused renal failure in flies as observed by swollen abdomen. Our observations clearly showed that these NPs could cause detrimental health ailments which relate to human birth deformities and kidney failure. Damage at the cellular level was studied through proteomic profiling. Three hundred and seven unique proteins were expressed on exposure to Al2O3 NPs and 51 proteins were differentially expressed. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed significant alteration in striated muscle cell differentiation, digestive tract morphogenesis, phototransduction, regulation of chromatin organization and DNA duplex unwinding.
Evolution is essential for shaping the biological functions. Darwin proposed the selection as the driving force for evolution upon mutations. While mutations are clear, the quantification of the selection force is still challenging. In this study, we identified and quantified both thermodynamic stability and kinetic accessibility as the selection forces for protein evolution. The protein evolution can be viewed and quantified as a trajectory moving along a superfunneled energy landscape with a line attractor at the bottom. The resulting evolved sequences and structures show strong protein characteristics including the hydrophobic core, high designability, and fast folding. The evolution principle uncovered here is validated on real proteins and sheds light on the protein design.
No previous studies have reported the effect of the presence of children with food allergies (FAs) on the diet and body mass index (BMI) of mothers. Therefore, we conducted a dietary survey and considered nutrients that influenced BMI of mothers.
Subjects included 554 mothers-305 mothers of children with FAs (FA mothers; aged 38.4 ± 5.1 years, FA group) and 249 mothers of children without FAs (non-FA mothers; aged 37.7 ± 5.5 years, NFA group).
We extracted dietary patterns from dietary survey results and investigated the correlation between nutrient intake and BMI. We divided the FA group into two groups (one containing 181 mothers whose children were allergic to ≤ 1 of the three major allergenic foods-eggs, milk and wheat-and another containing 124 mothers whose children were allergic to ≥ 2 of these foods) and conducted a comparative analysis.
BMI was significantly lower in the FA group than in the NFA group (20.7 vs. 21.4 kg/m2). There was a significant negative correlation between BMI and vegetable protein intake (β = -0.196, SE = 0.05). Vegetable protein intake was higher in the group that was allergic to ≥ 2 of the allergenic foods.
BMI of FA mothers is affected by a diet that strictly follows their FA child's allergen-free state-a diet dominated by vegetable protein. These observations suggested that the degree to which an FA mother is affected depends on the number of the three major allergenic foods to which her FA child is allergic.
The purpose of this study was to compare the hepatoprotective effects of Oxy (oxyresveratrol), Res (resveratrol), and MulA (mulberroside A) (80 mg/kg body weight/d, i.g.) on acute liver injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/d-galactosamine (d-GalN) in mice. After 7 h of LPS (50 μg/kg body weight, i.p.) and d-GalN (500 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) exposure, the activities of serum transaminases and antioxidant enzymes were determined. The expressions of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signal pathway, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signal pathway, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway related proteins were evaluated by Western blot assays. Histopathological analysis was performed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining on the separated livers of mice. The results showed that treatment with Oxy, Res, and MulA could significantly decreases the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ( P &lt; 0.01). MulA was the most effective ingredient among the three, and the ALT and AST levels were reduced at 90.3 ± 1.3% and 93.9 ± 1.1% compared with the LPS/D-GalN treated group ( P &lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, the stilbenes curbed the expression of inflammatory factors, NF-κB pathway activation, and MAPKs phosphorylation and upregulated antioxidant enzymes, Nrf2, NAD (P) H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression levels. Stilbenes might protect the ALI caused by LPS/d-GalN through inhibiting the negative effectiveness of oxidation stress and inflammation. The protective performance of MulA was better than those of Oxy and Res, and we hypothesize that it might be due to the mediation of the specific metabolic pathway of the MulA in vivo. All of these results implied that stilbenes in mulberry twigs might be promising as natural additives.
Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a primary enzyme that generates immunosuppressive metabolites. IDO1 plays a major role in tumor immunology and is a potential immune-based therapeutic target. We have reported that IDO1 protein expression was associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome in esophageal cancer. Recently, it has been reported that IDO1 expression is regulated by methylation of the IDO1 promoter. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between IDO1 expression, IDO1 promoter methylation, and clinicopathological features in esophageal cancer. We first confirmed changes in IDO1 expression levels in vitro by treating cells with 5-azacytidine (5-AZA). We then evaluated the relationship between IDO1 expression levels, IDO1 promoter methylation (bisulfite pyrosequencing), and clinicopathological features using 40 frozen samples and 242 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from resected esophageal cancer patients. We treated cell lines with 5-AZA, and the resulting hypomethylation induced significantly higher IDO1 expression (P&lt;0.001). In frozen samples, IDO1 expression levels correlated inversely with IDO1 promoter methylation levels (R=-0.47, P=0.0019). Furthermore, patients in the IDO1 promoter hypomethylation group (n=67) had a poor prognosis compared with those in the IDO1 promoter hypermethylation group (n=175) (overall survival, P=0.011). IDO1 promoter hypomethylation regulated IDO1 expression and was associated with a poor prognosis in esophageal cancer patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a protein from Emiliania huxleyi (E-FCP) is a member of the LHC family of light-harvesting proteins. It has a rather unusual pigment composition as its binds more Chl-c than Chl-a, and 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (hFx) as the main carotenoid instead of fucoxanthin (Fx) typically found in various FCP complexes. The presence of a hexanoyloxy tail in hFx suppresses the charge transfer character of the S1/ICT state resulting in almost no effect of polarity on the excited state dynamics of hFx, strongly contrasting with the excited-state properties of Fx. Here we report on the dynamics of the energy transfer between hFx and Chl in E-FCP, and we compare it with Fx-Chl energy transfer in the FCP complex from Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In both complexes, the excited hFx (Fx) transfers energy from the S2 state with a sub-100 fs time constant and no effect of the hexanoyloxy tail on the efficiency of the S2 route was found. The energy transfer via the S1/ICT state has in E-FCP two channels characterized by 1.5 and 11 ps time constants, while for FCP these two channels operate with time constants of 0.8 and 4.5 ps. Thus, minimizing the charge transfer character of S1/ICT in hFx results in about twice slower energy transfer via the S1/ICT state, underlining the importance of the ICT state in facilitating carotenoid-Chl energy transfer in systems utilizing keto carotenoids as energy donors.
Loss of the capacities of epidermal stem cells (ESCs) induced by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation has been widely associated with various skin diseases. Netrin-1, a member of the axonal guidance protein family, has displayed diverse biological functions in different types of cells and tissues, mediated by its specific receptor UNC-5 homolog B (UNC5b). In this study, we examined the physiological functions of netrin-1 and UNC5b in ESCs upon UV-B exposure. Our results indicate that UNC5b is expressed in ESCs, and its expression is upregulated in response to UV-B radiation. We found that treatment with netrin-1 prevented UV-B radiation-induced oxidative stress by reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX-4). Additionally, treatment with netrin-1 improved UV-B radiation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The presence of netrin-1 attenuated UV-B radiation-induced lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release. UV-B exposure resulted in the loss of the capacities of ESCs by reducing the expressions of integrin β1 and Krt19, the two major ESC markers. Importantly, this process was prevented by netrin-1. Silencing of UNC5b abolished the effects of netrin-1 on the expression of integrin β1 and Krt19, suggesting that the effects of netrin-1 in maintaining the capacities of ESCs are dependent on UNC5b. Mechanistically, we found that the Wnt/β-catenin signalling may be involved. Our findings suggest that netrin-1 may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of skin diseases.
After remaining elusive for many years, terminal hydride states have now been identified in several native and mutant [FeFe]-hydrogenases. In this Perspective, hydride states of [FeFe]-hydrogenases are considered on the basis of hydricity, a thermodynamic parameter that has been instrumental for the rational design of synthetic molecular catalysts. Importantly, it is shown how the hydricity of [FeFe]-hydrogenases can inspire future research efforts in both the study of hydrogenases and the design of molecular catalysts. By using hydricity, quantitative linear free energy relationships can be developed to relate the driving force and rate of different [FeFe]-hydrogenase variants. Further development of these correlations across a wide range of hydrogenase variants can potentially lead to new insights into the structure-activity relationships of [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The hydricity of [FeFe]-hydrogenase is also compared to select transition metal hydride complexes, which emphasizes the strong electronic communication between the diiron active site and the extended protein scaffold of the enzyme. A mechanism is proposed for how key hydrogen bonding interactions might affect the hydricity of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, providing a basis for the emulation of these structural features in synthetic molecular complexes.
The nominal concentration is generally used to express concentration-effect relationships in in vitro toxicity assays. However, the nominal concentration does not necessarily represent the exposure concentration responsible for the observed effect. Surfactants accumulate at interphases and likely sorb to in vitro system components such as serum protein and well plate plastic. The extent of sorption and the consequences of this sorption on in vitro readouts is largely unknown for these chemicals. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of sorption to in vitro components on the observed cytotoxic potency of benzalkonium chlorides (BAC) varying in alkyl chain length (6-18 carbon atoms, C6-18) in a basal cytotoxicity assay with the rainbow trout gill cell line (RTgill-W1). Cells were exposed for 48h in 96-well plates to increasing concentration of BACs in exposure medium containing 0, 60 μM Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Before and after exposure, BAC concentrations in exposure medium were analytically determined. Based on freely dissolved concentrations at the end of the exposure, median effect concentrations (EC50) decreased with increasing alkyl chain length up to 14 carbons. For BAC with alkyl chains of twelve or more carbons, EC50s based on measured concentrations after exposure in supplement-free medium were up to 25-times lower than EC50 calculated using nominal concentrations. When BSA or FBS was added to the medium, a decrease in cytotoxic potency of up to 22 times was observed for BAC with alkyl chains of eight or more carbons. The results of this study emphasize the importance of expressing the in vitro readouts as a function of a dose metric that is least influenced by assay setup to compare assay sensitivities and chemical potencies.
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are naturally occurring phytotoxins widely distributed in about 3% of flowering plants. The formation of PA-derived pyrrole-protein adducts is considered as a primary trigger initiating PA-induced hepatotoxicity. The present study aimed to (i) further validate our previous established derivatization method using acidified ethanolic AgNO3 for the analysis of pyrrole-protein adducts; and (ii) apply this method to characterize the binding tendency, dose-response, and elimination kinetics of pyrrole-protein adducts in the blood samples. Two pyrrole-amino acid conjugates, (±)-6,7-dihydro-7-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-5H-pyrrolizine (DHP)-cysteine (7-cysteine-DHP) and 9-histidine-DHP, were synthesized and used to demonstrate that acidified ethanolic AgNO3 derivatization can cleave both S-linkage and N-linkage of pyrrole-protein adducts. Subsequently, using pre-column AgNO3 derivatization followed by UHPLC-MS analysis we quantified pyrrole-protein adducts in monocrotaline-treated rat blood protein fractions, including hemoglobin (Hb), plasma, albumin, and plasma residual protein fractions, and found that amount of pyrrole-Hb adducts was significantly higher than that in all plasma fractions. Moreover, elimination half-life of pyrrole-Hb adducts was also significantly longer than pyrrole-protein adducts in plasma fractions (12.08 vs 2.54-2.93 days). In addition, we also tested blood samples obtained from 5 PA-induced liver injury patients and found that amount of pyrrole-protein adducts in blood cells were also remarkably higher than that in plasma. In conclusion, our findings for the first time confirmed that AgNO3 derivatization method could be used to measure both S- and N-linked pyrrole-protein adducts, and also suggested that pyrrole-Hb adducts with remarkably higher level and longer life span could be a better biomarker of PA exposure.
Respirable crystalline silica (RCS) produced in mining and construction industries can cause life-threatening diseases such as silicosis, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These diseases could be more effectively treated and prevented if RCS-related biomarkers were identified and measured at an early stage of disease progression, which makes development of a point of care test (POCT) platform extremely desirable for early diagnosis. In this work, a new, highly sensitive lab on a chip (LOC) immunoassay has been designed, developed, and characterized for tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), a protein biomarker that causes lung inflammation due to RCS exposure. The designed LOC device is composed of four reservoirs for sample, enzyme conjugated detection antibody, wash buffer, and chemiluminescence substrate in liquid form, along with three spiral reaction chambers for test, positive control, and negative control. All reservoirs and spiral microchannels were connected in series and designed to perform sequential delivery of immunoassay reagents with minimal user intervention. The developed LOC measured TNF-α concentrations as low as 16 pg/mL in plasma from RCS-exposed rats and also had a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 pg/mL in spiked artificial serum. In addition, the analysis time was drastically reduced to about 30 min, as opposed to hours in conventional methods. Successful implementation of a highly sensitive, chemiluminescence-based immunoassay on a preloaded LOC with proper quality control, as reported in this work, can pave the way toward developing a new rapid POCT platform for in-field clinical diagnosis.
In this paper, we report ultrasonically active nanoscale contrast agents that behave as thermometric sensors through phase change in their stabilizing phospholipid monolayer. Phospholipid-stabilized, hydrophobic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (P@hMSNs) are known to interact with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to promote cavitation at their surfaces, which can be used for both imaging and therapy. We show that the lateral lipid phase behavior of the phosphocholine lipid dictates the acoustic contrast of the P@hMSNs. When the lipids are in the gel phase below their melting temperature, the P@hMSNs generate detectable microbubbles when exposed to HIFU. However, if the lipids exhibit a liquid expanded phase, the P@hMSNs cease to generate bubbles in response to HIFU insonation. We verify that the heating and subsequent transition of lipid coating the hMSN are associated with the loss of acoustic response by doping laurdan dye into the lipid monolayer and imaging lipid phase through red shifts in emission spectra. Similarly, cessation of cavitation was also induced by adding a fluidizing surfactant such as Triton X, which could be reversed upon washing away the excess surfactant. Finally, by controlling for the partial fluidization caused by the adsorption of protein, P@hMSNs may be used as thermometric sensors of the bulk fluid temperature. These findings not only impact the utilization of nanoscale agents as stimulus-responsive ultrasound contrast agents but also have broader implications for how cavitation may be initiated at surfaces coated by a surfactant.
One of the fundamental challenges in obesity research is to identify subjects prone to weight gain so that obesity and its comorbidities can be promptly prevented or treated. The principles of thermodynamics as applied to human body energetics demonstrate that susceptibility to weight gain varies among individuals as a result of interindividual differences in energy expenditure and energy intake, two factors that counterbalance one another and determine daily energy balance and, ultimately, body weight change. This review focuses on the variability among individuals in human metabolism that determines weight change. Conflicting results have been reported about the role of interindividual differences in energy metabolism during energy balance in relation to future weight change. However, recent studies have shown that metabolic responses to acute, short-term dietary interventions that create energy imbalance, such as low-protein overfeeding or fasting for 24 hours, may reveal the underlying metabolic phenotype that determines the degree of resistance to diet-induced weight loss or the propensity to spontaneous weight gain over time. Metabolically "thrifty" individuals, characterized by a predilection for saving energy in settings of undernutrition and dietary protein restriction, display a minimal increase in plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 concentrations in response to a low-protein overfeeding diet and tend to gain more weight over time compared with metabolically "spendthrift" individuals. Similarly, interindividual variability in the causal relationship between energy expenditure and energy intake ("energy sensing") and in the metabolic response to cold exposure (e.g., brown adipose tissue activation) seems, to some extent, to be indicative of individual propensity to weight gain. Thus, an increased understanding and the clinical characterization of phenotypic differences in energy metabolism among individuals (metabolic profile) may lead to new strategies to prevent weight gain or improve weight-loss interventions by targeted therapies on the basis of metabolic phenotype and susceptibility to obesity in individual persons.
This study aimed to determine the effects of humanlike Western and Mediterranean diets on caloric intake, obesity, metabolism, and hepatosteatosis in an established nonhuman primate model of obesity, cardiometabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis.
A 38-month, randomized, preclinical, nonhuman primate primary prevention trial of 38 socially housed, middle-aged adult females was conducted. The monkeys were characterized during a 7-month baseline phase while consuming chow and then randomized to either Western or Mediterranean diets; the groups were balanced on baseline characteristics. Western and Mediterranean diets were formulated to closely reflect human diets, matched on macronutrient content, with protein and fat derived largely from animal sources in the Western diet and plant sources in the Mediterranean diet. Food consumption, activity levels, energy expenditure, body composition, carbohydrate metabolism, and hepatosteatosis were measured during baseline and treatment phases.
The Western diet increased caloric intake for the first 6 months and body fat, activity, energy expenditure, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis after 2.5 years, whereas the Mediterranean diet reduced triglyceride levels.
This is the first report of differential caloric intake and obesity with long-term consumption of a Western versus Mediterranean diet under controlled experimental conditions and the first experimental evidence that a Mediterranean diet protects against hepatosteatosis compared with a Western diet.

Char syndrome is characterized by persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) associated with hand-skeletal abnormalities and distinctive facial dysmorphism. Pathogenic variants in the transcription factor gene TFAP2B have been shown to cause Char syndrome; however, there is significant phenotypic variability linked to variant location. Here, we report a pediatric patient with a novel de novo variant in the fifth exon of TFAP2B, c.917C &gt; T (p.Thr306Met), who presented with PDA, patent foramen ovale, postaxial polydactyly of the left fifth toe and clinodactyly of the left fourth toe, sensorineural hearing loss, scoliosis, dental anomalies, and central diabetes insipidus (CDI). CDI, scoliosis, and hearing loss have not previously been reported in a patient with Char syndrome, and while the association may be coincidental, this report expands the genotypes and potentially phenotypes associated with this syndrome.
Overcoming epidermal growth factor receptor resistance is a critical problem that needs to be solved in clinical practice. Drugs that downregulate the fatty acid synthase-epidermal growth factor receptor will become novel treatments for non-small cell lung cancer. Solanum nigrum, extracted with water at 4°C, shows strong cytotoxic activity and inhibits tumour growth in Lewis tumour bearing-mice in a dose-dependent manner. A novel active compound in Solanum nigrum, solaoiacid, was successfully separated and purified from Solanum nigrum by preparative HPLC-MS and ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight-MS/MS. The IC50 of solaoiacid on lung cancer cells was 2.3 μmol/L, which was significantly lower than that of the known steroidal glycoalkaloid. Label-free proteomics and STRING Network analysis were used to identify significantly deregulated proteins in lung cancer cells that were treated with the fresh ripe fruit extracts of Solanum nigrum. Solanum nigrum regulates multiple signal pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway. Solanum nigrum downregulated 24 main proteins with direct roles in fatty acid biosynthesis. Both Solanum nigrum and solaoiacid showed strong downregulation of the fatty acid synthase-epidermal growth factor receptor and anti-non-small cell lung cancer effects, and thus will become a novel drug for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins play a protective role during desiccation and oxidation stresses. LEA3 proteins are a major group characterized by a hydrophilic domain (HD) with a highly conserved repeating 11-amino acid motif. We compared four different HD orthologs from distant organisms: (i) DrHD from the extremophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans; (ii) CeHD from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; (iii) YlHD from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica; and (iv) BnHD from the plant Brassica napus. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that all four HDs were intrinsically disordered in phosphate buffer and then folded into α-helical structures with the addition of glycerol or trifluoroethanol. Heterologous HD expression conferred enhanced desiccation and oxidation tolerance to Escherichia coli. These four HDs protected the enzymatic activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by preventing its aggregation under desiccation stress. The HDs also interacted with LDH, which was intensified by the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), suggesting a protective role in a chaperone-like manner. Based on these results, the HDs of LEA3 proteins show promise as protectants for desiccation and oxidation stresses, especially DrHD, which is a potential ideal stress-response element that can be applied in synthetic biology due to its extraordinary protection and stress resistance ability.
The Ministry of Health in Malawi has scaled-up antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. However, the majority of Malawians heavily depend on maize-based stiff porridge (nsima), a protein-deficient staple, a practice that exacerbates wasting and ultimately compromises the success of ART programming. This pilot study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of utilising soybean-enriched nsima as a strategy for managing HIV-related wasting among resource-poor people.
A before and after designed study involving 25 wasted (&lt;18.5 BMI (body mass index)) to normal (18.5-24.9 BMI) HIV-positive rural women (21-40 years) taking ART and provided with soybean-maize flour (20 kg/month for 3 months) prepared from hydrothermally treated soybeans and maize in the ratio of 1:4 (wt/wt). Anthropometry was performed at baseline and every month for the 3-month study period. Paired sample t-tests were used to test for changes in body mass and BMI between baseline and the subsequent months.
Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) cumulative mean weight gain for the first, second and third month of the study were 1.6, 2.1 and 2.9 kg, respectively. The number of participants with low BMI reduced from 6/25 at baseline to 2/25 after 3 months, and the mean BMI improved from 19.3 to 21.1 kg/m2 .
Nsima prepared from a blend of maize and hydrothermally treated soybeans could feasibly be used to prevent and manage wasting among resource-poor people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa who rely on maize as a major staple.
Osteoporotic fracture is one of the most common bone diseases in middle and old age, as the most serious consequence of osteoporosis. Sclerostin single-chain antibody fragments (SCL-scFv) has been proven to promote bone formation by binding to scleroprotein, a natural antagonist of the Wnt pathway, but it is difficult to rule alone due to the weak permeability and immunogenicity. Herein, we prepared poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres as a sustained-release vehicle to prolong the activity of SCL-scFv. The morphology of microspheres were uniform and nearly sphere, loading efficiency and encapsulation efficiency of SCL-scFv microspheres were 6.28±1.04% and 48.37 ± 8.11 %, respectively. Approximately 90% of the SCL-scFvs were released from the microspheres over 28 days with initial burst releasing (38%) in the first four days. Sustained release of active SCL-scFv from microspheres promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) osteogenic differentiation in vitro and enhanced fracture healing in ovariectomized (OVX) rats by improving bone mass and bone formation in the fracture region. All these findings demonstrate that the microspheres are able to simultaneously achieve localized long-term SCL-scFv controlled release and effectively promote bone formation, which provides a promising approach for osteoporotic fracture.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a congenital lung disease that leads to recurrent and chronic lung infection. The resulting inflammation causes lung damage and declines in lung function. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a first line host defense protein of importance for the innate immunity. Polymorphisms in the MBL gene named MBL2 result in unstable and low functional levels MBL proteins. MBL insufficiency is linked to an increased risk of lung infection and to declines in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. We investigated whether there is a similar link in patients with PCD.
This retrospective longitudinal study included 85 patients with PCD. Diagnostics and age at diagnosis were recorded, complete spirometry data starting at diagnosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection status over the last 2 years were collected, and the patients were grouped according to MBL2 genotype status (MBL2-sufficient or MBL2-deficient).
MBL-deficient patients were diagnosed almost 3 years earlier than MBL-sufficient patients (median 6.1 vs 8.9 years, P  &lt; 0.05). There were no differences in the first measured spirometry values, but MBL-deficient patients showed greater declines in forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1 ) than patients with MBL sufficiency (z-score: -0.049 per year [95% CI, -0.075; -0.021] vs -0.009 per year [95% CI, -0.033; 0.015]; P = 0.023). No differences were found in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1 /FVC, or infection status.
MBL-deficiency, which is associated with MBL2 mutations, was associated with a lower age at diagnosis and with steeper declines in FEV1 in patients with PCD. This suggests that the MBL genotype might be a disease modifier in PCD.
The bottom-up construction of cell mimics has produced a range of membrane-bound protocells that have been endowed with functionality and biochemical processes reminiscent of living systems. The contents of these compartments, however, experience semi-dilute conditions, whereas macromolecules in the cytosol are in a protein-rich crowded environment that affects their physicochemical properties such as diffusion and catalytic activity. Recently, complex coacervates have emerged as attractive protocellular models because their condensed interior is expected to better mimic this crowding. Here, we explore some relevant physicochemical properties of a recently developed polymer-stabilized coacervate system, such as the diffusion of macromolecules in the condensed coacervate phase compared to dilute solutions, the buffering capacity of the core, the molecular organization of the polymer membrane, the permeability characteristics of this membrane to a wide range of molecules, and the behavior of a simple enzymatic reaction. In addition, either the coacervate charge or cargo charge is engineered to allow the selective loading of protein cargo into the coacervate protocells. Our in-depth characterization reveals that this polymer-stabilized coacervate protocell has many desirable properties, making it an attractive candidate for the investigation of biochemical processes in a stable, controlled, tunable, and increasingly cell-like environment.
Mechanisms controlling the expression of the electrically conductive pili (e-pili) of Geobacter species are of interest because of the important role of e-pili in diverse biogeochemical processes, anaerobic digestion and electromicrobiological applications. We investigated the function of the protein, designated Spc (short pilin chaperone), encoded by the gene immediately downstream from the gene for PilA, the monomer that assembles into e-pili. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Spc forms an oligomer that is associated with the inner membrane. Mutating the start codon of spc to prevent translation increased the transcript abundance of pilA but greatly diminished the abundance of PilA, and e-pili could no longer be detected. Cross-linking, protein capture and two-hybrid studies demonstrated that Spc and PilA interacted. Two sites in PilA for electrostatic interaction with Spc were identified. The results demonstrate that Spc is required for PilA stability prior to incorporation into e-pili, suggesting that Spc has a chaperone function that may be specific to the relatively short PilA monomers that assemble into e-pili. These results are important for identifying microorganisms likely to express e-pili from (meta)genomic data and for the construction of microbial strains expressing e-pili.
Cav1.2 is the pore-forming subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (LTCC) that plays an important role in calcium overload and cell death in Alzheimer's disease. LTCC activity can be regulated by estrogen, a sex steroid hormone that is neuroprotective. Here, we investigated the potential mechanisms in estrogen-mediated regulation of Cav1.2 protein. We found that in cultured primary neurons, 17β-estradiol (E2) reduced Cav1.2 protein through estrogen receptor α (ERα). This effect was offset by a proteasomal inhibitor MG132, indicating that ubiquitin-proteasome system was involved. Consistently, the ubiquitin (UB) mutant at lysine 29 (K29R) or the K29-deubiquitinating enzyme TRAF-binding protein domain (TRABID) attenuated the effect of ERα on Cav1.2. We further identified that the E3 ligase Mdm2 (double minute 2 protein) and the PEST sequence in Cav1.2 protein played a role, as Mdm2 overexpression and the membrane-permeable PEST peptides prevented ERα-mediated Cav1.2 reduction, and Mdm2 overexpression led to the reduced Cav1.2 protein and the increased colocalization of Cav1.2 with ubiquitin in cortical neurons in vivo. In ovariectomized (OVX) APP/PS1 mice, administration of ERα agonist PPT reduced cerebral Cav1.2 protein, increased Cav1.2 ubiquitination, and improved cognitive performances. Taken together, ERα-induced Cav1.2 degradation involved K29-linked UB chains and the E3 ligase Mdm2, which might play a role in cognitive improvement in OVX APP/PS1 mice.
A 34-mer fragment peptide (C34) is contained in the HIV-1 envelope protein gp41. A dimeric derivative of C34 linked by a disulfide bridge in its C-terminus was synthesized and found to have potent anti-HIV activity, comparable to that of a previously reported pegylated dimer of C34REG. The downsizing of the linker moiety for dimerization was thus successful, and this result might shed some light on the mechanism of the suppression of 6-helical bundle formation by these C34 dimeric derivatives. Addition of Gly-Cys(CH2CONH2)-Gly-Gly at the N-terminal position of a C34 monomeric derivative significantly increases the anti-HIV-1 activity. This moiety functions as a new pharmacophore, which might provide a useful insight into the design of potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitors.
Sequence capture across large phylogenetic scales is not an easy task because hybridization capture is only effective when the genetic distance between the bait and target is small. Here, we propose a simple but effective strategy to tackle this issue: pooling DNA from a number of selected representative species of different clades to prepare PCR-generated baits to minimize the genetic distance between the bait and target. To demonstrate the utility of this strategy, we newly developed a set of universal nuclear markers (including 94 nuclear protein-coding genes) for Lepidoptera, a superdiverse insect group. We used a DNA pool from six lepidopteran species (representing six superfamilies) to prepare PCR baits for the 94 markers. These homemade PCR baits were used to capture sequence data from 43 species of 17 lepidopteran families, and 94% of the target loci were recovered. We constructed two data sets from the obtained data (one containing ~90 Kb target coding sequences and the other containing ~120 K target+flanking coding sequences). Both data sets yielded highly similar and well-resolved trees with 90% of nodes having &gt; 95% bootstrap support. Our capture experiment indicated that using DNA mixtures pooled from different clade representative species of Lepidoptera to prepare PCR baits can reliably capture a large number of targeted nuclear markers across different Lepidoptera lineages. We hope that this newly developed nuclear marker set will serve as a new phylogenetic tool for Lepidoptera phylogenetics, and the PCR bait preparation strategy can facilitate the application of sequence capture technique by researchers to accelerate data collection.

What is the central question of this study? Do Fog2Rb-/Rb- mice present a defect of small intestine homeostasis ? What is the main finding and its importance? We previously demonstrated the importance of interactions between FOG-2 and pRb in adipose tissue physiology. We make the novel observation here that this interaction is also intrinsic to small intestine homeostasis and exerts extrinsic control over mouse metabolism. Thus, this association is involved in maintaining small intestine morphology, and regulating crypt proliferation and lineage differentiation. It therefore affects mouse growth and adaptation to a high-fat diet.
GATA transcription factors and their FOG cofactors play a key role in tissue-specific development and differentiation, conserved from worms to humans. We have shown that GATA-1 and FOG-2 contain an LXCXE pRb-binding motif. Interactions between retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and GATA-1 are crucial for erythroid proliferation and differentiation, whereas the LXCXE pRb-binding site of FOG-2 is involved in adipogenesis. Fog2-knock-in mice have defective pRb binding and are resistant to obesity, due to efficient white-into-brown fat conversion. Our aim was to investigate the pathophysiological impact of FOG-2/pRb interaction on the small intestine and mouse growth. Histological analysis of the small intestine revealed architectural changes in Fog2Rb-/Rb- mice, including villus shortening, with crypt expansion and a change in muscularis propria thickness. These differences were more marked in the proximo-distal part of the small intestine and were associated with an increase in crypt cell proliferation and disruption of the goblet and Paneth cell lineage. The small intestine of the mutants was unable to adapt to a high-fat diet, and had significantly lower plasma lipid levels on such a diet. Fog2Rb-/Rb- mice displayed higher levels of GIP release, and lower levels of IGF-I release on a regular diet. Their intestinal lipid absorption was impaired, resulting in restricted weight gain. In addition to the intrinsic effects of the mutation on adipose tissue, we show here an extrinsic relationship between the intestine and the effect of FOG-2 mutation on mouse metabolism. In conclusion, the interaction of FOG-2 with pRb coordinates the crypt-villus axis and controls small intestine homeostasis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Drug latentiation is a process of modifying a drug molecule structurally to improve its binding affinity as well as increasing the drug-receptor interactions and potentiate its therapeutic potential. In the quest for discovering more potent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, gefitinib-based derivatives were designed by simple structural modification at the secondary amine of gefitinib by N-alkylation. Three gefitinib derivatives (gefitinib-NB, -NP, and -NIP) were synthesized by N-alkylation and phase transfer catalysis. Structural characterization, physicochemical parameters such as solubility, log P, and p K a were determined. Molecular docking studies were carried out to investigate the binding interactions at the active site. Further drug-bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein and drug-calf thymus (CT) DNA interactions were performed to understand the pharmacokinetics of the synthesized derivatives. All the compounds were screened for preliminary in vitro cytotoxic activity against A549, A431 lung, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines by MTT assay. The gefitinib-NP and gefitinib-NB derivatives exhibited strong cytotoxic activity compared with gefitinib. They also showed higher drug-BSA and drug-DNA interactions. Molecular docking studies showed the orientation and binding interactions with the EGFR as well as with BSA and CT DNA. The results establish a strong correlation between the experimental and molecular docking studies. EGFR inhibition studies were also carried out for the derivatives and we identified the NP derivative of gefitinib as a potential lead compound. The gefitinib-based derivatives reported herein are cytotoxic agents and can be tested for further pharmacokinetic profiles and toxicity studies which might be helpful for designing more potent gefitinib-based derivatives in the future.
Nowadays, several test methods with different useful values are available for diagnosis of the tuberculosis (TB) in non-human primates (NHPs). Despite some limitations of tuberculin skin test (TST), it is still the most commonly used method for TB testing of NHPs.
During this investigation, TST was performed upon three groups of experimentally tuberculin sensitized and one group of non-sensitized vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) by means of two types of old tuberculin (OT) and two types of purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin.
The data obtained from this study revealed that PPD tuberculin prepared from both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis has more advantages over OT in tuberculin testing of the vervet monkeys. The potency of the PPD tuberculin prepared from M bovis was estimated almost twice as much of the M tuberculosis.
Intrapalpebral injection of 0.1 mL of a concentration of ≥1 mg/mL of PPD tuberculin prepared from M bovis is the preferred method for TST of vervet monkeys.
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) participate in the regulation of different cell activities in response to stimuli. By applying different strategies, the modulation of heat shock proteins is at the center of attention. Conventional delivery approaches are not fully encouraged due to cytotoxicity and immunogenicity issues. Exosomes are touted as bio-shuttles for delivery of distinct biomolecules inside the cells. Here, we aimed to HSP27 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-tagged exosomes for the inhibition of Hsp27 in human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and explored differentiation into neuron-like cells. Exosomes were isolated, characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and CD63 then enriched with siRNA against Hsp27. Neuroblastoma cells were incubated with exosomes carrying siRNA for 48 hr. Exosome uptake was monitored by immunofluorescence assay. The cell viability and proliferation were analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and bromodeoxyuridine/5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays. The ability of cells to form colonies was evaluated by clonogenic assay. The cell potential to express NeuN, a mature neuron factor, was studied by flow cytometry analysis. SEM showed the nano-sized particles and a high level of CD63 after enrichment. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed an appropriate transfection rate in cell exposed to Hsp27 siRNA tagged exosomes. The cell viability and proliferation were reduced compared to cells received nude exosomes ( p &lt; 0.05). Clonogenic activity of cells was diminished by the inhibition of Hsp27. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the inhibition of Hsp27 prohibited NeuN content, showing the maturation of SH-SY5Y cells to mature cells compared to control. These data confirmed that exosomes could be used as appropriate bio-shuttles for the inhibition of Hsp27-aborted cell differentiation toward mature neuron.
The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and increased incidence of HIV coinfection fueled the difficulty in controlling tuberculosis (TB). MarR (multiple antibiotic resistance regulator) family transcription factors can regulate marRAB operon and are involved in resistance to multiple environmental stresses. We have summarized the structure, function, distribution, and regulation of the MarR family proteins, as well as their implications for novel targets for antibiotics, especially for tuberculosis.
Obesity is connected to the activation of chronic inflammatory pathways in both adipocytes and macrophages located in adipose tissues. The nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a central molecule involved in inflammatory pathways linked to the pathology of different complex metabolic disorders. Investigating the gene expression data in the adipose tissue would potentially unravel disease relevant gene interactions. The present study is aimed at creating a signature molecular network and at prioritizing the potential biomarkers interacting with NF-κB family of proteins in obesity using system biology approaches. The dataset GSE88837 associated with obesity was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical analysis represented the differential expression of a total of 2650 genes in adipose tissues (p = &lt;0.05). Using concepts like correlation, semantic similarity, and theoretical graph parameters we narrowed down genes to a network of 23 genes strongly connected with NF-κB family with higher significance. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 21 of 23 target genes of NF-κB were found to have a critical role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Interestingly, GEM and PPP1R13L were predicted as novel genes which may act as potential target or biomarkers of obesity as they occur with other 21 target genes with known obesity relationship. Our study concludes that NF-κB and prioritized target genes regulate the inflammation in adipose tissues through several molecular signaling pathways like NF-κB, PI3K-Akt, glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network, angiogenesis and cytokine pathways. This integrated system biology approaches can be applied for elucidating functional protein interaction networks of NF-κB protein family in different complex diseases. Our integrative and network-based approach for finding therapeutic targets in genomic data could accelerate the identification of novel drug targets for obesity.
Frozen shoulder is a common, fibro-proliferative disease characterised by the insidious onset of pain and progressively restricted range of shoulder movement. Despite the prevalence of this disease, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of this debilitating disease. Previous studies have identified increased myofibroblast differentiation and proliferation, immune cell influx and dysregulated cytokine production. We hypothesised that subpopulations within the fibroblast compartment may take on an activated phenotype, thus initiating the inflammatory processes observed in frozen shoulder. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the presence and possible pathogenic role of known stromal activation proteins in Frozen shoulder.
Shoulder capsule samples were collected from 10 patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder and 10 patients undergoing shoulder stabilisation surgery. Fibroblast activation marker expression (CD248, CD146, VCAM and PDPN, FAP) was quantified using immunohistochemistry. Control and diseased fibroblasts were cultured for in vitro studies from capsule biopsies from instability and frozen shoulder surgeries, respectively. The inflammatory profile and effects of IL-1β upon diseased and control fibroblasts was assessed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry and qPCR.
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased expression of fibroblast activation markers CD248, CD146, VCAM and PDPN in the frozen shoulder group compared with control (p &lt; 0.05). Fibroblasts cultured from diseased capsule produced elevated levels of inflammatory protein (IL-6, IL-8 &amp; CCL-20) in comparison to control fibroblasts. Exposing control fibroblasts to an inflammatory stimuli, (IL-1ß) significantly increased stromal activation marker transcript and protein expression (CD248, PDPN and VCAM).
These results show that fibroblasts have an activated phenotype in frozen shoulder and this is associated with inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Furthermore, it supports the hypothesis that activated fibroblasts may be involved in regulating the inflammatory and fibrotic processes involved in this disease.
Induction of a potent CD4 and CD8 T-cell response against tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigen is critical for eliminating tumor cells. Recent vaccination strategies have been hampered by an inefficacious and low amplitude immune response. Here we describe a self-adjuvanted chimeric protein vaccine platform to address these challenges, characterized by a multidomain construction incorporating (i) a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) allowing internalization of several multiantigenic Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-restricted peptides within (ii) the multiantigenic domain (Mad) and (iii) a TLR2/4 agonist domain (TLRag). Functionality of the resulting chimeric protein is based on the combined effect of the above-mentioned three different domains for simultaneous activation of antigen presenting cells and antigen cross-presentation, leading to an efficacious multiantigenic and multiallelic cellular immune response. Helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses were observed against model-, neo- and self-antigens, and were highly potent in several murine tumor models. The safety and the immunogenicity of a human vaccine candidate designed for colorectal cancer treatment was demonstrated in a non-human primate model. This newly engineered therapeutic vaccine approach is promising for the treatment of poorly infiltrated tumors that do not respond to currently marketed immunotherapies.
Active networks composed of filaments and motor proteins can self-organize into a variety of architectures. Computer simulations in two or three spatial dimensions and including or omitting steric interactions between filaments can be used to model active networks. Here we examine how these modelling choices affect the state space of network self-organization. We compare the networks generated by different models of a system of dynamic microtubules and microtubule-crosslinking motors. We find that a thin 3D model that includes steric interactions between filaments is the most versatile, capturing a variety of network states observed in recent experiments. In contrast, 2D models either with or without steric interactions which prohibit microtubule crossings can produce some, but not all, observed network states. Our results provide guidelines for the most appropriate choice of model for the study of different network types and elucidate mechanisms of active network organization.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widely involved in the regulation of physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and lipid metabolism. They might be associated with the pathological process of atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of our study is to investigate whether plasma miRNA-155 levels have a relationship with AF recurrence.
A total of 110 patients with AF were studied, all with successful cardioversion. We measured the expression of plasma miRNA-155 in the recurrent group (n = 30) and in the nonrecurrent group (n = 80) by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In addition, the serumal levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), total cholesterol (TC), and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the groups were determined by using an automatic biochemical analyzer, and an immunoenzymatic method was applied to determine the serumal levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The left atrial diameter (LAD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of all patients were measured by using echocardiography.
Our RT-PCR analysis found that miRNA-155 was significantly upregulated in the recurrent group compared with the nonrecurrent group. These increases of LAD and the levels of BNP, TNF-α, CRP, and IL-6 in the recurrent group were also revealed to be relative to those in the nonrecurrent group. There were no differences in the levels of TC and FBG, as well as in EF, between the groups. Moreover, miRNA-155 expression was observed to correlate positively with these outcomes of LAD, BNP, TNF-α, CRP, IL-6, and LAD. A diagnostic significance of predicting AF recurrence for plasma miRNA-155 was elucidated via ROC curve analysis.
Our findings revealed that plasma miRNA-155 can present an ability to calculate AF recurrence after cardioversion.
The status of the swelling-activated chloride channel (ICl, swell) during heart failure remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether the ICl, swell activity is altered during heart failure and to determine how the ICl, swell influences atrial arrhythmias of the failing heart.
We established a heart failure rabbit model and analyzed the hemodynamic indicators 8 weeks after myocardial infarction, which include left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVDEP). Five untreated rabbits and 5 receiving a sham operation served as the control group. Left auricular appendage tissues were obtained and CLCN3 mRNA/CLCN3 protein expression levels were examined by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively.
Compared to the control group, the heart failure group showed a significantly decreased LVSP (14.2 ± 0.27 versus 16.9 ± 0.86 kPa, P &lt;.05)and elevated LVDEP (2.49 ± 0.30 versus 0.15 ± 0.03 kPa, P &lt;.05), indicating that myocardial infarction leads to progressive heart failure of rabbits in the heart failure group. CLCN3 mRNA and CLCN3 protein expression were both significantly elevated in the heart failure group compared to the control group (P &lt;.05).
In sum, we propose that the dynamic nature of ICl, swell upregulation may contribute to the elevated expression of CLCN3 mRNA and CLCN3 protein, resulting in myocardial cell remodeling induced by heart failure. However, further study is needed to investigate the potential functions of ICl, swell, especially the relation between ICl, swell augmentation and arrhythmia after heart failure.
Designing highly selective compounds to protein subtypes and developing allosteric modulators targeting them are critical considerations to both drug discovery and mechanism studies for cannabinoid receptors. It is challenging but in demand to have classifiers to identify active ligands from inactive or random compounds and distinguish allosteric modulators from orthosteric ligands. In this study, supervised machine learning classifiers were built for two subtypes of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. Three types of features, including molecular descriptors, MACCS fingerprints, and ECFP6 fingerprints, were calculated to evaluate the compound sets from diverse aspects. Deep neural networks, as well as conventional machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and ensemble learning, were applied. Their performances on the classification with different types of features were compared and discussed. According to the receiver operating characteristic curves and the calculated metrics, the advantages and drawbacks of each algorithm were investigated. The feature ranking was followed to help extract useful knowledge about critical molecular properties, substructural keys, and circular fingerprints. The extracted features will then facilitate the research on cannabinoid receptors by providing guidance on preferred properties for compound modification and novel scaffold design. Besides using conventional molecular docking studies for compound virtual screening, machine-learning-based decision-making models provide alternative options. This study can be of value to the application of machine learning in the area of drug discovery and compound development.
Computational approaches have previously been introduced to predict compounds with activity against multiple targets or compound combinations with synergistic functional effects. By contrast, there are no computational studies available that explore combinations of targets that might act synergistically upon small molecule treatment. Herein, we introduce an approach designed to identify synergistic target pairs on the basis of cell-based screening data and compounds with known target annotations. The targets involved in forming synergistic pairs were analyzed through a novel network propagation algorithm for rationalizing possible common synergy mechanisms. This algorithm enabled further analysis of each synergistic target pair and the identification of "interactors", i.e., proteins with higher propagation scores than would be expected by adding the individual contributions of each target in the synergistic pair. We detected 137 synergistic target pairs including 51 unique targets. A global network analysis of these 51 targets made it possible to derive a subnetwork of proteins with significant synergy. Furthermore, interactors were identified for 87 synergistic target pairs upon individual analysis of the network propagation of each pair. These interactors were associated with pathways related to cancer and apoptosis, membrane transport, and steroid metabolism and provided possible explanations of synergistic effects.
Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a type of mycotoxin disruptive to intestinal and immune systems. To better understand the molecular effects of DON exposure, we performed genome-wide comparisons of DNA methylation and gene expression from porcine intestinal epithelial cell IPEC-J2 upon DON exposure using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq technologies. We characterized the methylation pattern changes and found 3030 differentially methylated regions. Moreover, 3226 genes showing differential expression were enriched in pathways of protein and nucleic acid synthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Integrative analysis identified 29 genes showing inverse correlations between promoter methylation and expression. Altered DNA methylation and expression of various genes suggested their roles and potential functional interactions upon DON exposure. Our data provided new insights into epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations of intestinal epithelial cells upon DON exposure, and may advance the identification of biomarkers and drug targets for predicting and controlling the toxic effects of this common mycotoxin.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of age-related dementia and currently affects approximately 5.7 million Americans. Major brain changes associated with AD pathology include accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein fragments and formation of extracellular amyloid plaques. Redox-active metals mediate oligomerization of Aβ, and the resultant metal-bound oligomers have been implicated in the putative formation of harmful, reactive species that could contribute to observed oxidative damage. In isolated plaque cores, Cu(II) is bound to Aβ via histidine residues. Despite numerous structural studies of Cu(II) binding to synthetic Aβ in vitro, there is still uncertainty surrounding Cu(II) coordination in Aβ. In this study, we used X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XAS to investigate Cu(II) coordination in Aβ(1-42) under various solution conditions. We found that the average coordination environment in Cu(II)Aβ(1-42) is sensitive to X-ray photoreduction, changes in buffer composition, peptide concentration, and solution pH. Fitting of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) suggests Cu(II) is bound in a mixture of coordination environments in monomeric Aβ(1-42) under all conditions studied. However, it was evident that on average only a single histidine residue coordinates Cu(II) in monomeric Aβ(1-42) at pH 6.1, in addition to 3 other oxygen or nitrogen ligands. Cu(II) coordination in Aβ(1-42) at pH 7.4 is similarly 4-coordinate with oxygen and nitrogen ligands, although an average of 2 histidine residues appear to coordinate at this pH. At pH 9.0, the average Cu(II) coordination environment in Aβ(1-42) appears to be 5-coordinate with oxygen and nitrogen ligands, including two histidine residues.
Bacterial infection is still a ticklish clinical challenge even though some advanced antibacterial materials and techniques have been put forward. This work reports that rapid and effective antibacterial performance is achieved by the synergistic local photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTDT). Within 10 min of light irradiation, both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are almost completely eliminated by the action of photothermy (52.1 °C) and limited reactive oxygen species (ROS), the corresponding bacterial killing efficiencies are 99.91 and 99.97%, respectively, which are far higher than single modal therapy, i.e., photothermal therapy or photodynamic therapy with antibacterial efficacy of 50 or 70%, respectively. The mechanism is that bacterial membrane permeation is increased by PTDT because photothermy shows more severe impact only on E. coli by destroying the outmost bacterial panniculus, whereas the inner panniculus of the two kinds of bacteria is more sensitive to ROS. Hence, ROS penetrates the bacterial membrane more easily, and meanwhile, the proteins in the bacteria are severely lost after the bacterial membrane disruption, which leads to bacterial death. In vivo results reveal that rapid and effective sterilization is an important process to accelerate wound healing, and the traumas on the rats' backbones heal well within 12 days by PTDT. Furthermore, the PTDT is friendly to major organs of rats during the therapeutic process. Therefore, the synergistic therapy system can be a safe therapeutic system for clinical sterilization with great potential. More importantly, the antibacterial mechanism presented in this work has great guiding significance for the design of other advanced antibacterial systems and techniques.
Infectious bronchitis (IB) virus genome codes for four structural proteins, among which the S1 subunit of spike glycoprotein comprises the major epitopes to induce neutralizing antibodies. This study involved the comparison of the full S1 sequences of five IB viruses, namely two Massachusetts and three 793/B serotypes, isolated from IB outbreaks during 2001-2002, with all other Iranian and foreign 793/B isolates and 10 known serotypes. Analysis of S1 subunit showed three unique amino acid changes at positions 349 (V to L), 392 (T to N), and 393 (Q or R to T or K or S) for the Iranian 793/B isolates, compared to those of the foreign 793/B isolates reported before 2006 (onset of vaccination with 793/B vaccine in Iran). They were used as amino acid markers for the differentiation of Iranian 793/B isolates for years. Sequence alignment of the Iranian isolates with those of the foreign ones reported after 2006 demonstrated that amino acids 392 and 393 were no longer considered as amino acid markers, and only the change in amino acid 349 still remained specific to the Iranian 793/B isolates. Phylogenetic tree sequence analysis revealed that the Iranian 793/B isolates were closely related indicating that they came from a single source, more probably from France. There was a very close correlation between the first detection of 793/B serotype and the time of French chicken meat importation. Moreover, it was shown that one of the Massachusetts isolates was completely identical with the H120 vaccine strain. Furthermore, the other Massachusetts isolate with two amino acid changes at positions 64 (G to E) and 95 (S to R) was very similar to this vaccine strain. It seems that the latter isolate is a passaged chicken H120 vaccine strain.
The haemolytic biovar of Gallibacterium anatis (G. anatis) is responsible for urogenital, gastrointestinal, and respiratory diseases in chickens. There are numerous reports on the resistance of G. anatis to antibiotics and recurrence of the disease, which raise concerns about antimicrobial treatment efficiency. Vaccination has been considered as the most feasible procedure of prevention in high risk farms. Subunit vaccines containing immunogenic components can have practical protective value in preventive measures regarding the infection. The present study aimed to introduce a polytopic vaccine candidate based on epitope detection. All registered sequences of four immunogenic proteins, includig Flfa, GTxA, Gab_1309, and Gab_2348 were retrieved and directed for variational analysis. A vaccine isolate was selected for each protein and tested for B-cell epitope mapping using different tools. Furthermore, consensus selected immunogenic regions with special patterns fused together by flexible linkers were integrated into two constructs and checked for the best status of proteasomal cleavage sites, as well as hydropathy plot. Moreover, back translations, along with codon optimization were performed, and then some tags were added to the constructs. The selected consensus B-cell immunogenic epitopes were for 12656: AA114-181, 7990: AA114-181, Avicor: AA42-77, 134-197, and IPDH: 61-155 for Flfa protein, AA185-235, AA372-457, and AA807-941 for GtxA-N, AA260-305, AA340-400, and AA110-146 for Gab-1309, and AA125-AA175 for Gab-2348. Two suitable patterns of attachment were selected from the different fusion patterns of epitopes in B-cell polytopic vaccinal constructs. Finally, the examination of these constructs showed their effect and efficacy for immune system stimulation. Based on bioinformatics results, these immunogens could be utilized as potential candidates to develop polytopic protective vaccines and design diagnostic kits.
Brucella bacterium causes Brucellosis, an infectious disease spreading from animals to human. Brucella lumazine synthase (BLS) is a highly immunogenic protein with adjuvant properties, which has been introduced as an effective protein carrier for vaccine development. This protein also plays a significant role in inducing immune system. This study aimed to clone, express, and purify the BLS gene from Brucella melitensis Rev1. The BLS gene was amplified by particular primers with the restriction enzyme sites as a linker and it was inserted into pTZ57R/T vector. Subsequently, it was ligated into pET32(a)+ expression vector. Recombinant expression vector containing coding sequence of BLS was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) host gene expression and stimulated by 0.1mM IPTG. The results of sequencing showed that there were not any mutations in BLS encoding sequence. The expression results were set by sequencing and endorsed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analyses and western blotting that showed 35 kDa protein band appropriately.
Cyclomarins are highly potent antimycobacterial and antiplasmodial cyclopeptides isolated from a marine bacterium (Streptomyces sp.). Previous studies have identified the target proteins and elucidated a novel mode of action, however there are currently only a few studies examining the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for both pathogens. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of 17 novel desoxycyclomarin-inspired analogues. Optimiza¬tion via side chain modifications of the non-canonical amino acids led to potent lead structures for each pathogen.
We previously found that circulating β2 -glycoprotein I inhibits human endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis via diverse mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor activities of β2 -glycoprotein I using structure-function analysis and mapped the critical region within the β2 -glycoprotein I peptide sequence that mediates anticancer effects. We constructed recombinant cDNA and purified different β2 -glycoprotein I polypeptide domains using a baculovirus expression system. We found that purified β2 -glycoprotein I as well as recombinant β2 -glycoprotein I full-length (D12345), polypeptide domains I-IV (D1234), and polypeptide domain I (D1) significantly inhibited melanoma cell migration, proliferation and invasion. Western blot analyses were used to determine the dysregulated expression of proteins essential for intracellular signaling pathways in B16F10 treated with β2 -glycoprotein I and variant recombinant polypeptides. Using a melanoma mouse model, we found that D1 polypeptide exhibited stronger potency in suppressing tumor growth. Structural analysis revealed that fragments A and B within domain I would be the critical regions responsible for antitumor activity. Annexin A2 was identified as the counterpart molecular for β2 -glycoprotein I by immunofluoresence and co-immunoprecipation assays. Interaction between specific amino acids of β2 -glycoprotein I D1 and annexin A2 was later evaluated by the molecular docking approach. Moreover, five amino acid residues were selected from fragments A and B for functional evaluation using site-directed mutagenesis, and P11A, M42A, and I55P mutations were shown to disrupt the anti-melanoma cell migration ability of β2 -glycoprotein I. This is the first study to show the therapeutic potential of β2 -glycoprotein I D1 in treatment of melanoma progression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The aim of this work was to evaluate the cholesterol extraction process in ice cream mixes (ICMs) by using β-cyclodextrin (βCD) and to analyze the effect of this extraction on the ICM rheological, stability, and sensory characteristics. The effects of fat and whey protein (WP) additions on ICM stability were also evaluated. The maximum percentage obtained for cholesterol extraction was 93.6%. The flow curves indicated that ICM showed a thixotropic behavior before and after cholesterol extraction, which was enhanced when the fat content and/or percentage of βCD increased. The stability of ICM with cholesterol-reduced content (RCho-ICM) was influenced by the fat content and/or the presence of WP. The RCho-ICM with the highest fat and/or WP addition showed less tendency to melt and had the smallest amount of accumulated molten liquid. These latter ICMs presented the slowest melting rates. Also, RCho-ICMs proved to be more stable than ICMs. RCho-ICM samples obtained with a ratio of βCD/fat content of 1% w/w were evaluated by a trained sensory panel. In addition, an acceptability test of the sample with better sensory attributes was conducted. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The effects of a cholesterol extraction process and fat and whey protein additions on the rheological and stability characteristics of ice cream mixes were evaluated. The extraction of cholesterol from an ice cream mix is interesting from a nutritional point of view and the extraction process of cholesterol itself may also help to improve the mix stability by controlling the fat and/or whey protein contents. These findings may prove useful as a starting point for the rational design of new functional ice cream mixes.
Over 96% of high-grade ovarian carcinomas and 50% of all cancers are characterized by alterations in the p53 gene. Therapeutic strategies to restore and/or reactivate the p53 pathway have been challenging. By contrast, p63, which shares many of the downstream targets and functions of p53, is rarely mutated in cancer.
A novel strategy is presented for circumventing alterations in p53 by inducing the tumor-suppressor isoform TAp63 (transactivation domain of tumor protein p63) through its direct downstream target, microRNA-130b (miR-130b), which is epigenetically silenced and/or downregulated in chemoresistant ovarian cancer.
Treatment with miR-130b resulted in: 1) decreased migration/invasion in HEYA8 cells (p53 wild-type) and disruption of multicellular spheroids in OVCAR8 cells (p53-mutant) in vitro, 2) sensitization of HEYA8 and OVCAR8 cells to cisplatin (CDDP) in vitro and in vivo, and 3) transcriptional activation of TAp63 and the B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-inhibitor B-cell lymphoma 2-like protein 11 (BIM). Overexpression of TAp63 was sufficient to decrease cell viability, suggesting that it is a critical downstream effector of miR-130b. In vivo, combined miR-130b plus CDDP exhibited greater therapeutic efficacy than miR-130b or CDDP alone. Mice that carried OVCAR8 xenograft tumors and were injected with miR-130b in 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) liposomes had a significant decrease in tumor burden at rates similar to those observed in CDDP-treated mice, and 20% of DOPC-miR-130b plus CDDP-treated mice were living tumor free. Systemic injections of scL-miR-130b plus CDDP in a clinically tested, tumor-targeted nanocomplex (scL) improved survival in 60% and complete remissions in 40% of mice that carried HEYA8 xenografts.
The miR-130b/TAp63 axis is proposed as a new druggable pathway that has the potential to uncover broad-spectrum therapeutic options for the majority of p53-altered cancers.
We aim to study the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of lycopene on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats, anticipating a complementary strategy for the prevention of long-term complications of T2DM. In this study, rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were divided into four groups, receiving a 10-week lycopene intervention: DM, DM + low dose of lycopene (L), DM + medium dose of lycopene (M), and DM + high dose of lycopene (H) group with 0, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg BW lycopene, respectively. At the end of intervention, fasted blood glucose (FBG) level, oxidative stress indicators, including glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), glycosylated low-density lipoprotein, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as antioxidants, that is, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined. The results indicated that oxidative stress and inflammatory factors were elevated in DM rats. Lycopene intervention decreased the FBG level in DM rats compared with the untreated ones. It revealed a dose-dependent effect on decreasing serum oxidative stress biomarkers, including GHb, ox-LDL, and MDA. Inflammatory factors (TNF-α and CRP) in DM rats were also decreased by lycopene intervention. Total antioxidative capacity as well as the activities of antioxidants in DM rats including CAT, SOD, and GPx were increased after lycopene intervention. We conclude that lycopene protects against diabetic progression and prevents further complications of diabetic rats through ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as improving the systemic antioxidative capacity. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: According to our study, lycopene intakes at experimental dosages appear to have beneficial effects on ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats, suggesting that lycopene might help improving T2DM progression when its daily intake is up to about 0.79 mg/kg BW in humans, which approximately equals to 5 mg/kg BW in rats. However, more clinical trials are needed to provide a more reliable and convincing conclusion in humans.
A cholecystokinin (CCK) system has been identified in white adipose tissue (WAT). Nevertheless, the endocrine actions of CCK on WAT remain unknown. Our goal was to investigate the role of CCK in regulating the production of adiponectin, an adipokine expressed in WAT, which is pivotal in preserving energy homeostasis.
The effect of the bioactive CCK fragment CCK-8 on adiponectin production was studied both in vivo and in vitro. CCK-8 effects were characterized in rats treated with selective CCK-1 (CCK-1R) and CCK-2 receptor (CCK-2R) antagonists as well as in pre-adipocytes carrying the selective silencing of either CCK-1R or CCK-2R. The influence of insulin on CCK-8 responses was also analysed.
CCK-8 increased plasma adiponectin levels as well as adiponectin gene (Adipoq) expression in WAT. Coherently, CCK-8 up-regulated adiponectin production in pre-adipocytes. CCK-8 effects were abolished by L-365,260, a selective CCK-2R antagonist. CCK-2R knockdown also abolished CCK-8 effects in pre-adipocytes. Moreover, in vitro CCK-8 effects were blocked by the specific inhibitor of protein kinase B (Akt) triciribine, as well as by the PPARγ antagonist T0070907. Silencing the expression of the insulin receptor (IR) inhibited CCK-8-induced Adipoq expression in pre-adipocytes. Furthermore, insulin potentiated the effect of CCK-8.
CCK-8 stimulates adiponectin production in WAT by acting on CCK-2R, through a mechanism involving both Akt and PPARγ. Moreover CCK-8 actions are only observed in presence of insulin. Our results could be endowed with translational value in order to design new insulin-sensitizing therapies.
Two-dimensional electronic-vibrational (2DEV) spectroscopy is a new coherent spectroscopic technique, which shows considerable promise for unravelling complex molecular dynamics. In this Discussion we describe an application to the energy transfer pathway in the major light harvesting protein, LHCII, providing new data on the center line slopes (CLS) of the spectral peaks. The CLS provides information that appears unique to the 2DEV method. We then outline a general approach to calculating 2DEV spectra which is valid for strongly and weakly coupled molecular systems. We conclude with some prospects for the future development of 2DEV spectroscopy and its theoretical analysis.
Glucagon, a hormone released from pancreatic alpha-cells, plays a key role in maintaining proper glucose homeostasis and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes. In vitro studies suggest that intra-islet glucagon can modulate the function of pancreatic beta-cells. However, because of the lack of suitable experimental tools, the in vivo physiological role of this intra-islet cross-talk has remained elusive. To address this issue, we generated a novel mouse model that selectively expressed an inhibitory designer G protein-coupled receptor (Gi DREADD) in α-cells only. Drug-induced activation of this inhibitory designer receptor almost completely shut off glucagon secretion in vivo, resulting in significantly impaired insulin secretion, hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance. Additional studies with mouse and human islets indicated that intra-islet glucagon stimulates insulin release primarily by activating β-cell GLP-1 receptors. These new findings strongly suggest that intra-islet glucagon signaling is essential for maintaining proper glucose homeostasis in vivo. Our work may pave the way toward the development of novel classes of antidiabetic drugs that act by modulating intra-islet cross-talk between α- and β-cells.
Randomized controlled trials conducted in Mediterranean countries have shown that the Mediterranean diet lowers adverse cardiovascular events. In the American population, diet remains the biggest uncontrolled risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
This study aimed to test the hypothesis that asynchronous dietary counseling supplied through a custom smartphone app results in better adherence to a Mediterranean diet in a non-Mediterranean population than traditional standard-of-care (SOC) counseling.
In total, 100 patients presenting to the cardiology clinic of an academic medical center were randomized to either the SOC or smartphone app-based experimental (EXP) Mediterranean diet intervention after informed consent and 1 hour of individual face-to-face dietary counseling with a registered dietitian. Participants in EXP received a custom smartphone app that reinforced the Mediterranean diet, whereas participants in SOC received 2 additional sessions of in-person dietary counseling with the registered dietitian-30 min at 1 month and 30 min at 3 months. Preexisting knowledge of a Mediterranean diet was measured by the validated Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) instrument. Baseline height, weight, blood pressure (BP), and laboratory biomarkers were collected. At 1, 3, and 6 months, participants presented for a follow-up appointment to assess compliance to the Mediterranean diet using the MDS as well as a patient satisfaction survey, BP, and weight. Repeat laboratory biomarkers were performed at 3 and 6 months.
Enrolled participants had a mean age with SE of 56.6 (SD 1.7) for SOC and 57.2 (SD 1.8) for EXP; 65.3% of SOC and 56.9% of EXP were male, and 20.4% of SOC and 35.3% of EXP had coronary artery disease. There were no significant differences between EXP and SOC with regard to BP, lipid parameters, hemoglobin A1c, or C-reactive protein (CRP). Participants in EXP achieved a significantly greater weight loss on average of 3.3 pounds versus 3.1 pounds for participants in SOC, P=.04. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased significantly over time for both groups (P&lt;.001), but there was no significant difference between groups (P=.69). Similarly, there was no significant difference in diet satisfaction between EXP and SOC, although diet satisfaction increased significantly over time for both groups. The proportion of participants with high Mediterranean diet compliance (defined as the MDS ≥9) increased significantly over time (P&lt;.001)-from 18.4% to 57.1% for SOC and 27.5% to 64.7% for EXP; however, there was no significant difference between the groups.
Both traditional SOC counseling and smartphone-based counseling were effective in getting participants to adhere to a Mediterranean diet, and these dietary changes persisted even after counseling had ended. However, neither method was more effective than the other. This pilot study demonstrates that patients can change to and maintain a Mediterranean diet with either traditional or smartphone app-based nutrition counseling.

Many bacterial pathogens can cause septicemia and spread from the bloodstream into internal organs. During leptospirosis, individuals are infected by contact with Leptospira-containing animal urine-contaminated water. The spirochetes invade internal organs after septicemia to cause disease aggravation, but the mechanism of leptospiral excretion and spreading remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that Leptospirainterrogans entered human/mouse endothelial and epithelial cells and fibroblasts by caveolae/integrin-β1-PI3K/FAK-mediated microfilament-dependent endocytosis to form Leptospira (Lep)-vesicles that did not fuse with lysosomes. Lep-vesicles recruited Rab5/Rab11 and Sec/Exo-SNARE proteins in endocytic recycling and vesicular transport systems for intracellular transport and release by SNARE-complex/FAK-mediated microfilament/microtubule-dependent exocytosis. Both intracellular leptospires and infected cells maintained their viability. Leptospiral propagation was only observed in mouse fibroblasts. Our study revealed that L. interrogans utilizes endocytic recycling and vesicular transport systems for transcytosis across endothelial or epithelial barrier in blood vessels or renal tubules, which contributes to spreading in vivo and transmission of leptospirosis.
Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of molecules that emerge from the condensation of sugars and proteins via the Maillard reaction. Despite a significant number of studies showing strong associations between AGEs and the pathologies of aging-related illnesses, it has been a challenge to establish AGEs as causal agents primarily due to the lack of tools in reversing AGE modifications at the molecular level. Here, we show that MnmC, an enzyme involved in a bacterial tRNA-modification pathway, is capable of reversing the AGEs carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) back to their native lysine structure. Combining structural homology analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and protein domain dissection studies, we generated a variant of MnmC with improved catalytic properties against CEL in free amino acid form. We show that this enzyme variant is also active on a CEL-modified peptidomimetic and an AGE-containing peptide that has been established as an authentic ligand of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Our data demonstrate that MnmC variants are promising lead catalysts toward the development of AGE-reversal tools and a better understanding of AGE biology.
 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor act as a major contributor to lymphangioma, but their role on nonrecurrent and recurrent lymphangiomas remain unclear. We aim to investigate those factors in the generation of recurrent lymphangioma.
 Patients diagnosed with lymphangioma from January 2005 to December 2012 in our hospital were collected and divided into nonrecurrent and recurrent lymphangiomas. The clinical characteristics including age, sex, symptoms, location, and size of lymphangioma were collected. Surgical resection samples were collected for histology, protein and mRNA detection of VEGF-C, VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), and neuropilin 2 (Nrp2). Follow-ups including lymphangioma recurrent and the local symptoms such as ulcer were reviewed.
 A total of 80 patients aged from 5 months to 12 years were enrolled in this study, 51 patients had no recurrence and other 29 patients suffered from recurrent lymphangioma. There was no significant difference in demographic data and clinical characters between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Immunohistochemistry staining showed that VEGFR-3 remained unchanged between nonrecurrent and recurrent lymphangiomas (p &gt; 0.05), and VEGF-C and Nrp2 were significantly increased in recurrent lymphangioma compared with nonrecurrent lymphangioma (p &lt; 0.05). The same expression trend was proved as detected by protein and mRNA levels.
 The VEGF-C/Nrp2 axis was significantly increased in the recurrent lymphangioma, indicating that VEGF-C/Nrp2 targeted therapy may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for recurrent lymphangioma.
Platelet-based applications are currently used for the delivery of growth factors and other biomolecules as autologous biomaterials in regenerative medicine and cosmetic therapies. Many studies have revealed that platelet-based applications such as platelet-rich plasma and platelet releasate exhibit beneficial biological effects after a sports injury or trauma when administered locally by intramuscular injections. At present, treatment of the public, patients and athletes with platelet-based applications is permitted and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and the World Anti-Doping Agency. Since 2011 the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma is permitted in competitive sports by the World Anti-Doping Agency, due to the lack of evidence in performance enhancement and anabolic effects. However, accumulating research has recently shed light on the role of platelet-derived growth factors in wound healing, skeletal myogenesis, muscle stem cell function and tissue regeneration. Although any ergogenic potential of platelet-rich plasma and platelet releasate on intact skeletal muscle and human sports performance remain to be established, novel evidence suggests that platelet-derived growth factors can modulate muscle, tendon, ligament, protein synthesis/degradation, vascularization, energy utilization and regenerative capacity in various experimental settings. Since platelet-based applications are currently not prohibited, they constitute a tool for potential abuse and doping in sports. The aim of this review is to critically discuss and assimilate current insights and biological evidence that set the ground for exploitation and misuse in competitive sports, and develop strategies to combat these activities.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may rarely lead to protein-losing gastropathy that presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, edema in immunocompetent children, but extremely rarely with only generalized edema.
A previously healthy 5-year-old boy presented with generalized edema without any other symptoms. He had hypoalbuminemia but no proteinuria. He was evaluated for gastrointestinal protein loss, and hypertrophic gastropathy was revealed on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Meanwhile, CMV infection was detected by serologic tests and polymerase chain reaction in the blood. He recovered spontaneously in a week.
CMV-related protein-losing gastropathy may present with generalized edema without any gastrointestinal symptoms.
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) usually manifest with disorder of thyroid hormone; however, the correlation is unknown.
The study was designed to explore the relationships between CKD and thyroid dysfunction.
A total number of 905 non-dialysis participants were collected at Nanjing First Hospital from August 2009 to October 2012 according to the case records system. Patients were grouped via the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the KDIGO guideline. Levels of thyroid hormone and biomarkers in different CKD groups were compared by ANOVA. Prevalence of different thyroid diseases was calculated by χ2 test.
We found that FT3 or T3 became more prevalent with increasing eGFR with the lowest level in CKD5 (p &lt; 0.01). No significant differences were found between groups in FT4, T4, or TSH (p &gt; 0.05). Frequency of euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) in CKD groups was high, especially in CKD stage 5 (69.1%, p &lt; 0.01). eGFR had positive correlation with T3 and FT3 (r = 0.239, p = 0.0001; r = 0.292, p = 0.0001). ESS had correlations with prealbumin, β2-microglobin, eGFR, and C-reactive protein (r = 0.095, p = 0.004; r = -0.12, p = 0.001; r = 0.091, p = 0.007; r = -0.096, p = 0.008; r = 0.154, p = 0.001). After adjustment for prealbumin, uric acid, HbA1c, age, gender, eGFR, and β2-microglobin, binary regression revealed that hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and albumin were independent influence factors of ESS (p = 0.016, r = 1.014; p = 0.023, r = 1.007; p = 0.029, r = 0.996).
CKD patients have a high morbidity of ESS, mainly low T3 syndrome. Anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition may contribute to ESS in CKD.
Tri-ortho -cresyl phosphate (TOCP) has been widely used as plasticizers, plastic softeners, and flame-retardants in industry and reported to have male reproductive toxicology. However, it is still unknown whether TOCP affects the female reproductive system and its underlying mechanism. In the present study, we found that TOCP exposure significantly decreased ovarian coefficient, caused disintegration and depletion of the granulosa cells in the ovary tissue and significantly inhibited the level of serum estradiol (E2). TOCP markedly increased both LC3-II and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I as well as autophagy proteins ATG5 and Beclin1 in the ovary tissue, implying that TOCP could induce autophagy in the ovary tissue. To further investigate the potential mechanism, primary ovarian granulosa cells were isolated in vitro and treated with 0-0.5 mM TOCP for 48 h. We showed that TOCP decreased the number of viable mouse granulosa cells without affecting cell cycle and apoptosis of the cells. Intriguingly, TOCP treatment markedly increased both LC3-II and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I as well as ATG5 and Beclin1. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that autophagic vesicles in the cytoplasm increased significantly in the TOCP-treated cells, indicating that TOCP could induce autophagy in the cells. Taken together, TOCP reduces the number of viable cells and induces autophagy in mouse ovarian granulosa cells without affecting cell cycle and apoptosis.
After primary infection, varicella zoster virus (VZV) becomes latent in ganglionic neurons. If immunity declines, VZV is reactivated and can spread to the dermatome depending from this ganglion and in some cases to the spinal cord. Myelopathy is rare and may develop in the absence of skin rash making the diagnosis very difficult.
From 1994 to 2014, we collected five observations of clinically and laboratory confirmed zoster myelopathy. The age of our patients ranged from 14 to 78. They did not have any significant past medical history. Four patients had a history of radicular rash. After 3 weeks (4-45 days), patients presented paraparesis, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an elevated protein level (5/5cases) and pleocytosis (2/5 cases). Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated T2 hyper intense lesions with swelling and contrast enhancement. The diagnosis was supported by laboratory evidence, including the detection of VZV antibodies in the CSF. All patients received intravenous acyclovir and two patients received IV methylprednisolone. A marked improvement was observed in most of the patients within 2 months.
Based on our patients and on previous reports, we highlight the possibility of the occurrence of VZV myelopathy in immunocompetent subjects. The diagnosis must be evoked even in the absence of typical skin lesions. In this case, spinal cord MRI and virological tests are useful tools for the diagnosis. We also emphasize on the importance of accurate diagnosis to enable the specific treatment and ameliorate the outcome.
Alzheimer's disease accounts for the majority of dementia and shows hallmarks such as sequential cognitive dysfunction and abnormal behavior. Dendropanax morbifera (DM) has traditionally been used to treat a variety of diseases in East Asia. The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic effects of DM on brain neuron damage and on cognitive deficit in neuronal cell induced by Aβ1-42 in mice. Treatment with DM reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and protected against the death of neuronal cells induced by Aβ1-42 peptide. In addition, it was also found that pretreatment with DM decreased cognitive damage induced by Aβ peptide via enhancing the cholinergic system and antioxidant defense system in mice. Furthermore, the study verified that the change in the expression of both cyclic-adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein and of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus in Aβ peptide-treated mice was significantly ameliorated after treatment with DM. Accordingly, these results suggest that pretreatment with DM defends against oxidative stress and cognitive impairment caused by Aβ peptide.
The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) signaling pathway is stimulated by bacteria and, together with its putative ligand peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), propagates proinflammatory responses.
We aimed to evaluate the TREM-1/PGLYRP1/interleukin (IL)-1β regulation in response to biofilm accumulation and removal in an experimental human gingivitis model.
The study (n = 42 participants, mean age: 23.8 ± 3.7 y) comprised a recruitment step (day -14) followed by experimentally induced biofilm formation (induction [I] phase, day 0 to +21) and a 2-wk resolution (R) phase (day +21 to +35). Plaque was recorded by the Modified Quigley and Hein Plaque Index (TQHPI), while records of gingival inflammation were based on the Modified Gingival Index (MGI). Unstimulated whole saliva supernatants (n = 210, 5 time points) were tested for TREM-1, PGLYRP1, and IL-1β by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
During the I-phase, concentrations of all analytes showed a tendency for downregulation at day +7 compared to day 0. TREM-1 (P = 0.019) and PGLYRP1 (P = 0.007) increased significantly between day +7 and day +21. Although all analyte levels decreased during the R-phase, the difference was not significant except TREM-1 being at borderline significance (P = 0.058). Moreover, TREM-1, PGLYRP1, and IL-1β showed significant positive correlations (P &lt; 0.0001) with each other. The study participants were grouped into "fast" and "slow" responders based on clinical gingival inflammation scores. At each time point, fast responders showed significantly higher concentrations of TREM-1 (P &lt; 0.025), PGLYRP1 (P &lt; 0.007), and IL-1β (P &lt; 0.025) compared to slow responders. Mixed-effects multilevel regression analyses revealed that PGLYRP1 (P = 0.047) and IL-1β (P = 0.005) showed a significant positive association with the MGI scores.
The study demonstrated that TREM-1 and PGLYRP1 are regulated in response to biofilm accumulation and removal, and fast responders demonstrated higher levels of these analytes compared to slow responders.
The results of this study demonstrated the suitability of salivary TREM-1 and PGLYRP1 to reflect biofilm accumulation and removal and PGLYRP1 to monitor the progression and resolution of inflammation in gingivitis-susceptible individuals (fast responders). Combined with conventional risk factors, the molecular toolbox proposed here should be further validated in future studies to confirm whether it can be used for population-based monitoring and prevention of gingivitis.
Under physiologic conditions, conjunctival goblet cells (CGCs) secrete mucins into the tear film to preserve ocular surface homeostasis. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), like resolvins (Rvs), regulate secretion from CGCs and actively terminate inflammation. The purpose of this study was to determine if RvD2 stimulated mucin secretion and to investigate the cellular signaling components. Goblet cells were cultured from rat conjunctiva. Secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay, change in intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) using Fura-2, and cellular cAMP levels by ELISA. RvD2 (10-11-10-8 M) stimulated secretion, increased cellular cAMP levels and the [Ca2+]i. RvD2-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i and secretion was blocked by Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis and the PKA inhibitor N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride but not by the cAMP exchange protein inhibitor α-[2-(3-chlorophenyl)hydrazinylidene]-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-b-oxo-3-isoxazolepropanenitrile. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) increased [Ca2+]i. Increasing cAMP with 8-Br-cAMP inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i stimulated by the cAMP-independent agonist cholinergic agonist carbachol. In conclusion, RvD2 uses both cellular cAMP and [Ca2+]i to stimulate glycoconjugate secretion from CGCs, but the interaction of cAMP and [Ca2+]i is context dependent. Thus RvD2 likely assists in the maintenance of the mucous layer of the tear film to sustain ocular surface homeostasis and has potential as a novel treatment for dry eye disease.-Botten, N., Hodges, R. R., Li, D., Bair, J. A., Shatos, M. A., Utheim, T. P., Serhan, C. N., Dartt, D. A. Resolvin D2 elevates cAMP to increase intracellular [Ca2+] and stimulate secretion from conjunctival goblet cells.
RIP1 kinase regulates necroptosis and inflammation and may play an important role in contributing to a variety of human pathologies, including inflammatory and neurological diseases. Currently, RIP1 kinase inhibitors have advanced into early clinical trials for evaluation in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis and neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we report on the design of potent and highly selective dihydropyrazole (DHP) RIP1 kinase inhibitors starting from a high-throughput screen and the lead-optimization of this series from a lead with minimal rat oral exposure to the identification of dihydropyrazole 77 with good pharmacokinetic profiles in multiple species. Additionally, we identified a potent murine RIP1 kinase inhibitor 76 as a valuable in vivo tool molecule suitable for evaluating the role of RIP1 kinase in chronic models of disease. DHP 76 showed efficacy in mouse models of both multiple sclerosis and human retinitis pigmentosa.
An optimal response to immune checkpoint blockade requires the presence of effector cells in the tumor microenvironment. We designed a PD-L1-targeted delivery strategy for chemokines, key molecules that drive leukocyte trafficking, to the tumor microenvironment, as a means of attracting the relevant leukocyte populations. This strategy combines a PD-L1-blocking single-domain antibody fragment (nanobody or VHH), a charge-engineered chemokine CCL21, and its subsequent characterization in a microfluidic device that resembles the tumor microenvironment. We show that the PD-L1-blocking VHH is a reliable fusion partner for the preparation of a functional chemokine fusion. Engineering the surface charge of CCL21 reduced its nonspecific binding to glycosaminoglycans, a property of chemokines that complicates their targeted delivery. Using a microfluidic assay, we show that it is possible to deliver a chemokine-VHH fusion to a PD-L1-positive environment and recruit effector cells.
Allergy to cow's milk protein is a common problem in children. The clinical manifestations of the reactions that are mediated by IgE are varied and the anaphylactic reactions can be life-threatening.
A girl at an age of four months and a half that, five minutes after consuming cereal with cow's milk, had rashes in the perioral area and extensive pruritic micropapular lesions associated with vomit and inspiratory stridor. She received adrenaline by intramuscular injection and antihistamines by intravenous injection. She was first evaluated in a service of allergy treatment when she was six months and twenty days old. The results of the allergen-specific immunoglobulin E test were positive. The treatment was initiated with a hydrolyzed rice formula and supplementary feeding.
Anaphylaxis can be the first and last manifestation of a food allergy. The right education for parents about strictly avoiding the food that triggered the allergic reaction and the right training in the use of intramuscular adrenalin may result in a better prognosis for patients.
Antecedentes: La alergia a la proteína de la leche de vaca es un problema frecuente en los niños. Las manifestaciones clínicas de las reacciones mediadas por IgE son variadas y las reacciones anafilácticas pueden poner en riesgo la vida Caso clínico: Niña que a los cuatro meses y medio de edad, después de cinco minutos de consumir cereal preparado con leche de vaca, presentó erupciones periorales y lesiones micropapulares generalizadas, pruriginosas, asociadas con vómito y estridor inspiratorio. Recibió adrenalina intramuscular y antihistamínicos intravenosos. Fue evaluada por primera vez en un servicio de alergología a los seis meses y 20 días de edad. Los resultados de la inmunoglobulina E específica fueron positivos. Se inició tratamiento con fórmula hidrolizada de arroz y alimentación complementaria. Conclusión: La anafilaxia puede ser la primera y última manifestación de una alergia alimentaria. La educación adecuada a los padres acerca de evitar estrictamente el alimento desencadentante de la reacción alérgica y el entrenamiento en el uso de la adrenalina intramuscular puede traducirse en un mejor pronóstico para los pacientes.
Amino acids are a natural choice as building blocks for developing bio-functional entities owing to their superior diversity and versatile physicochemical properties compared to nucleotide bases. A simple permutation of amino acids creates a broad palette of proteins that are successfully engineered as useful bio-functional agents. For example, the intrinsic ultraviolet fluorescence of phenylalanine (F) and tryptophan (W) have been engineered to emit in the visible spectrum [1, 2], that has broad applications as imaging/sensing probes, photothermal therapy agents, optogenetic switches, etc. Nature produces more colorful coats/furs, feathers/hairs, and eyes [3], through various biochemical modification of tyrosine (Y) based pigmentation. However, it is challenging to modulate the fluorescence wavelength from UV to visible region based on oligopeptide. In this article, we report an innovative approach to construct cyan fluorescence by de novo tripeptides containing glycine (G), Y and lysine (K), which form robust dimer structures under moderate oxidizing conditions. Through the in vitro mutation approach, we figure out that both amino acids and their sequence plays significant roles in modulating the fluorescence. We believe this work holds great promise in developing novel cell imaging and resonance energy-transfer-based fluorescent probes.
Improved quality of life (QoL) after oral immunotherapy (OIT) in peanut allergic children is often reported by their parents, while the child's perspective is less clear.
We aimed to explore if two years of OIT improved QoL in children with peanut allergy and to identify factors influencing change in QoL.
In the open labelled TAKE-AWAY peanut OIT trial including children with anaphylaxis to peanuts, 57 were randomized to OIT and 20 to observation. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 was completed by parents and children at enrolment (Y0 ), after one year (end of up-dosing) (Y1 ) and after two years (Y2 ) of OIT. Minimally clinically important difference (MCID) is ≥5.3. Perceived treatment burden was recorded by visual analogue scales, including adverse events (AEs). An open food challenge (OFC) was performed at Y2 .
At Y2 , 18 children had discontinued OIT, 2/39 OIT-children refused OFC, while 35/37 were desensitized to 7500 mg peanut protein. From Y0 to Y2, the mean change (95% confidence intervals) in QoL was 4.4 (0.5, 8.3) among child self-reports and twice as large among parental proxy-reports (9.3 (4.3, 14.3)) (both p&lt;0.0001), without significant improvement among the controls. The change in QoL was significantly different from the controls for the parental proxy-reports only (p=0.002). Neither treatment burden nor AEs significantly predicted changes in QoL.
Two years of OIT improved child-QoL as reported by parents, but not by the children, suggesting that parents may over-estimate improvement in child-QoL by OIT. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Leukocyte recruitment is critical during many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Chemokines are key mediators of leukocyte recruitment during the inflammatory response, by signaling through specific chemokine G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition, chemokines interact with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to generate a chemotactic gradient. The chemokine IL8/CXCL8, a prototypical neutrophil chemoattractant, is characterised by a long, highly positively charged GAG-binding C-terminal region, absent in most other chemokines. In order to examine whether the CXCL8 C-terminal peptide has a modulatory role in GAG binding during neutrophil recruitment, we synthesised the wild type CXCL8 C-terminal [CXCL8 (54-72)] (Peptide 1), a peptide with a substitution of glutamic acid (E) 70 with lysine (K) (Peptide 2) to increase positive charge; and also, a scrambled sequence peptide (Peptide 3). Surface Plasmon Resonance showed that Peptide 1, corresponding to the core CXCL8 GAG-binding region, binds to GAG but Peptide 2 binding was detected at lower concentrations. In the absence of cellular GAG, the peptides did not affect CXCL8 induced calcium signaling or neutrophil chemotaxis along a diffusion gradient, suggesting no effect on GPCR binding. All peptides equally inhibited neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells under physiological flow conditions. Peptide 2, with its greater positive charge and binding to polyanionic GAG, inhibited CXCL8-induced neutrophil transendothelial migration. Our studies suggest that the E70K CXCL8 peptide, may serve as a lead molecule for further development of therapeutic inhibitors of neutrophil-mediated inflammation based on modulation of chemokine-GAG binding.

A simple and rapid HPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for simultaneous measure of PCr and its metabolites creatine (Cr), creatinine (Cre) in children's plasma. 50 μL of plasma was prepared by protein precipitation with acetonitrile/water (1000 μL, 1:1, v/v) followed by separated on an Hypersil GOLD C18 column (35o C) with gradient mobile phase consisting of 2 mM ammonium acetate aqueous solution (pH 10) and methanol at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and analyzed by mass spectrometry in both positive (PCr) and negative (Cr and Cre) ion multiple reaction monitoring mode. Good linearity (r &gt; 0.99) were obtained for three analytes, the CV of intra-day and inter-day were less than 5.46% (-13.09% ≤ RE ≤ 2.57%). The averaged recoveries of three analytes were 70.9% - 97.5%. No obvious impact was found for the quantitation of three analytes in normal, hemolyzed and hyperlipemia plasma. In the end, this method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic (PK) study of PCr in children (six cases) with VMCC after intravenous infusion of 2 g of test drug. The PK parameters of PCr/Cr were as follows: t1/2 0.24/0.83 h, Tmax 0.49/0.55 h, Cmax 47.34/59.29 μg/mL, AUClast 17.07/59.63 h*μg/mL, AUCinf 17.16/79.01 h*μg/mL, MRT 0.29/0.67 h.
The B7 family checkpoint molecules are potential therapeutic targets in cancer immunotherapy. However, their expression status in human gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) remains unknown. We investigated the expression profiles of the B7 family checkpoint proteins PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-H3, B7-H4, VISTA, and B7-H6 in GTNs and their clinical significance.
We identified 112 patients with GTN, including 68 with choriocarcinoma, 33 with placental-site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT), and 11 with epithelioid trophoblastic tumour (ETT). Immunohistochemical staining was performed on whole-tissue GTN sections using anti-B7 family antibodies. VISTA expression was immunohistochemically analyzed using microarrays of normal human tissues and of 20 common cancers. PD-L1 and B7-H3 were highly expressed in all GTN tumours, while PD-L2 was expressed in 87.5% of the samples. B7-H4 and B7-H6 were negative in 100% and 98.2% of the samples, respectively. PD-L1, B7-H3, and VISTA levels were significantly higher in choriocarcinomas and PSTTs than in ETTs. There was no association between B7 family checkpoint expression in tumour cells and disease stage, prognostic score, or patient outcomes (complete remission vs. death). VISTA protein was widely overexpressed in 98.2% of all the GTN but its expression varied in other cancer types and was negative in normal adult and fetal tissues except placental trophoblasts and splenic lymphocytes.
The GTN trophoblast cells show high expression of PD-L1, B7-H3, and VISTA in a manner that is independent of clinical outcomes. These proteins may be potential immunotherapeutic targets when treating GTN. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
In Streptomyces clavuligerus, the gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the clinically used β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid contains a gene (orf12 or cpe) encoding a protein with a C-terminal class A β-lactamase-like domain. The cpe gene is essential for clavulanic acid production, and the recent crystal structure of its product (Cpe) was shown to also contain an N-terminal isomerase/cyclase-like domain, but the function of the protein remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Cpe is a cytoplasmic protein and that both its N- and C-terminal domains are required for in vivo clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. Our results along with those from previous studies allude towards a biosynthetic role for Cpe during the later stages of clavulanic acid production in S. clavuligerus. Amino acids from Cpe essential for biosynthesis were also identified, including one (Lys89) from the recently described N-terminal isomerase-like domain of unknown function. Homologues of Cpe from other clavulanic acid-producing Streptomyces spp. were shown to be functionally equivalent to the S. clavuligerus protein, whereas those from non-producers containing clavulanic acid-like gene clusters were not. The suggested in vivo involvement of an isomerase-like domain recruited by an ancestral β-lactamase related protein, supports a previous hypothesis that Cpe could be involved in a step requiring the opening and modification of the clavulanic acid core during its biosynthesis from 5S precursors.
Gene synthesis services have largely superseded traditional PCR methods for the generation of cDNAs destined for bacterial expression vectors. This, in turn, has increased the application of codon-optimized cDNAs where codons rarely used by Escherchia coli are replaced with common synonymous codons to accelerate translation of the target. A markedly accelerated rate of expression often results in a significant uplift in the levels of target protein but a substantial proportion of the enhanced yield can partition to the insoluble fraction rendering a significant portion of the gains unavailable for native purification. We have assessed several expression attenuation strategies for their utility in the manipulation of the soluble fraction towards higher levels of soluble target recovery from codon optimized systems. Using a set of human small GTPases as a case study, we compare the degeneration of the T7 promoter sequence, the use of alternative translational start codons and the manipulation of synonymous codon usage. Degeneration of both the T7 promoter and the translational start codon merely depressed overall expression and did not increase the percentage of product recovered in native purification of the soluble fraction. However, the selective introduction of rare non-optimal codons back into the codon-optimized sequence resulted in significantly elevated recovery of soluble targets. We propose that slowing the rate of extension during translation using a small number of rare codons allows more time for the co-translational folding of the nascent polypeptide. This increases the proportion of the target recovered in the soluble fraction by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Thus, a "de-optimization" of codon-optimized cDNAs, to attenuate or pause the translation process, may prove a useful strategy for improved recombinant protein production.
Natural genetic variation can determine the outcome of an infection, and often reflects the co-evolutionary battle between hosts and pathogens. We previously found that a natural variant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from Hawaii (HW) has increased resistance against natural microsporidian pathogens in the Nematocida genus, when compared to the standard laboratory strain of N2. In particular, HW animals can clear infection, while N2 animals cannot. In addition, HW animals have lower levels of initial colonization of Nematocida inside intestinal cells, compared to N2. Here we investigate how this natural variation in resistance relates to autophagy. We found that there is much better targeting of autophagy-related machinery to parasites under conditions where they are cleared. In particular, ubiquitin targeting to Nematocida cells correlates very well with their subsequent clearance in terms of timing, host strain and age, as well as species of Nematocida. Furthermore, clearance correlates with targeting of the LGG-2/LC3 autophagy protein to parasite cells, with HW animals having much more efficient targeting of LGG-2 to parasite cells than N2 animals. Surprisingly, however, we found that LGG-2 is not required to clear infection. Instead, we found that LGG-2/LC3 regulates Nematocida colonization inside intestinal cells. Interestingly, LGG-2/LC3 regulates intracellular colonization only in the HW strain, and not in N2. Altogether these results demonstrate that there is natural genetic variation in an LGG-2-dependent process that regulates microsporidia colonization inside intestinal cells, although not microsporidia clearance.
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been a notable etiological agent of acute respiratory infection in humans, but it was not discovered until 2001, because HMPV replicates only in a limited number of cell lines and the cytopathic effect (CPE) is often mild. To promote the study of HMPV, several groups have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant HMPV strains (HMPVGFP). However, the growing evidence has complicated the understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV, because it seems to vary notably among HMPV strains. In addition, unique A2b clade HMPV strains with a 180-nucleotide duplication in the G gene (HMPV A2b180nt-dup strains) have recently been detected. In this study, we re-evaluated and compared the cell line specificity of clinical isolates of HMPV strains, including the novel HMPV A2b180nt-dup strains, and six recombinant HMPVGFP strains, including the newly generated recombinant HMPV A2b180nt-dup strain, MG0256-EGFP. Our data demonstrate that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells generally showed the highest infectivity with any clinical isolates and recombinant HMPVGFP strains. Other human-derived cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells) showed certain levels of infectivity with HMPV, but these were significantly lower than those of VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells. Also, the infectivity in these suboptimal cell lines varied greatly among HMPV strains. The variations were not directly related to HMPV genotypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide duplications in the G gene. Thus, these variations in suboptimal cell lines are likely intrinsic to particular HMPV strains.
Pear psylla, Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang &amp; Li) are present as two seasonal morphotypes in pear orchards where they, suck phloem sap, defoliate pear trees, and cause fruit russet. Despite the importance of natural enemies in psyllid control, the interactions between predators and the two seasonal morphotypes of psyllids remain poorly documented. Here we determined the predation efficiencies of the Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) on the two psyllid morphotypes. Predation of H. axyridis on both morphotypes conformed to a Type II functional response: the proportion of consumed psyllids decreased with increasing prey densities. Predation efficiency of H. axyridis against the winterforms increased with temperature when measured from 8 to 25°C. Predation rate on the summerforms was significantly higher than that of the winterforms. This was linked to smaller body size, higher soluble protein level, thinner cuticle, and lower chitin content of summerform psyllids compared to winterform psyllids. Predation capacities of H. axyridis on both morphotypes indicated its potential as a biocontrol agent in psyllids management. Predation efficiency was higher on summerforms, likely due to the difference in body size, exoskeleton fragility, and nutritional value between the two morphotypes. Due to the Type II functional response of H. axyridis to both morphotypes of pear psylla, application of H. axyridis in pear orchards under suitable temperatures could be taken into consideration for suppression of C. chinensis, although further experiments conducted in field conditions are needed to validate our findings.
There is a vast gulf between the two primary strategies for simulating protein-ligand interactions. Docking methods significantly limit or eliminate protein flexibility to gain great speed at the price of uncontrolled inaccuracy, whereas fully flexible atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are expensive and often suffer from limited sampling. We have developed a flexible docking approach geared especially for highly flexible or poorly resolved targets based on mixed-resolution Monte Carlo (MRMC), which is intended to offer a balance among speed, protein flexibility, and sampling power. The binding region of the protein is treated with a standard atomistic force field, while the remainder of the protein is modeled at the residue level with a Gō model that permits protein flexibility while saving computational cost. Implicit solvation is used. Here we assess three facets of the MRMC approach with implications for other docking studies: (i) the role of receptor flexibility in cross-docking pose prediction; (ii) the use of non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) and (iii) the use of pose-clustering in scoring. We examine 61 co-crystallized ligands of estrogen receptor α, an important cancer target known for its flexibility. We also compare the performance of the MRMC approach with Autodock smina. Adding protein flexibility, not surprisingly, leads to significantly lower total energies and stronger interactions between protein and ligand, but notably we document the important role of backbone flexibility in the improvement. The improved backbone flexibility also leads to improved performance relative to smina. Somewhat unexpectedly, our implementation of NCMC leads to only modestly improved sampling of ligand poses. Overall, the addition of protein flexibility improves the performance of docking, as measured by energy-ranked poses, but we do not find significant improvements based on cluster information or the use of NCMC. We discuss possible improvements for the model including alternative coarse-grained force fields, improvements to the treatment of solvation, and adding additional types of NCMC moves.
Inflammation plays a critical role in initiation of adaptive immunity, pathogen clearance and tissue repair. Interleukin (IL)-1β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and therefore its production is tightly regulated: its secretion requires the assembly of a macromolecular protein complex, termed the inflammasome. Aberrant activation of the inflammasome has been linked to debilitating human diseases including chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Thus, there is a great interest in understanding how inflammasomes are regulated. Here we show that Dicer, an enzyme necessary for the production of mature micro-RNAs (miRNAs), is required for optimal activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow macrophages. Our data indicate that miRNAs may play an important role in promoting inflammasome activation.
The aim of this study was to investigate the proliferation effect of fractionated lotus seed resistant starch (LRS3-20%, LRS3-30%) and the structural changes following fermentation. Fractionated lotus seed resistant starch, especially LRS3-20%, promoted the proliferation of these probiotics, and Bifidobacterium longum produced large quantities of acetic acid, while Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus produced lactic acid. Additionally, the probiotics with lotus seed resistant starch (LRS3) and LRS3-20% survived more successfully in simulated gastrointestinal solutions compared to glucose, LRS3-30% and high amylose maize starch, but LRS3 and LRS3-20% differed in their abilities to enhance the tolerance to acidic buffer, bile acid and simulated gastric juice. Furthermore, after fermentation, fractionated lotus seed resistant starch displayed a loose, rough surface. The crystalline and double helical structure increased as the amount of amorphous and sub-crystalline structure reduced following fermentation. Interestingly, structural changes were correlated with the original structures and utilisation by the probiotics.
SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan, is reabsorbed by the intestinal tract during excretion, causing diarrhoea and neutropenia. In addition, the association between blood levels of SN-38 and neutropenia has been reported previously, and the rapid excretion of SN-38 from the intestinal tract is considered to prevent neutropenia. Oral alkalization drugs are used as prophylactic agents for suppressing SN-38 reabsorption. The relationship between oral alkalization drugs and neutropenia, however, has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between oral alkalization drugs and neutropenia in irinotecan-treated patients.
Patients with cervical or ovarian cancer were administered irinotecan and investigated by medical chart reviews to determine whether oral alkalization drugs were effective at ameliorating irinotecan-induced neutropenia. The drug combination in the oral alkalization drugs-ursodeoxycholic acid, magnesium oxide, and sodium hydrogen carbonate-significantly improved neutrophil counts and reduced dose intensity compared with those of non-users. In the large-scale Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, the reporting odds ratio of irinotecan-induced neutropenia was significantly lower when irinotecan had been given in combination with oral alkalization drugs.
These data indicate that oral alkalization drugs may reduce the frequency of neutropenia caused by irinotecan administration, making it possible to increase the dose safely.
Resistant starch (RS) has been studied for its ability to serve as a substrate for the microbiota present in the human large intestine and for its beneficial physiological effects. The aim of this study was to screen and select novel strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the genus Bifidobacterium isolated from human fecal samples for further application as probiotics relying on their utilization of RS3, a prebiotic.
LAB were isolated from human fecal samples, based on their ability to utilize RS3 as a carbon source. Consequently, two LAB were identified as Bifidobacterium adolescentis based on morphological, physiological and biochemical properties, and molecular biological analysis. The RS3-utilizing ability of these isolates was shown by the rapid decrease in pH of RS3-MRS media and by the pinhole traces on the surface of RS3 particles. Isolated B. adolescentis JSC2 was shown to be negative for β-glucuronidase, suggesting that it would be safe for human use, and was found to be tolerant towards the acidic, bile-salt environment.
This synbiotics approach of B. adolescentis JCS2, an RS-utilizing probiotics, coupled with RS utilization, is expected to enhance RS utilization in the food industry and be beneficial for the promotion of human health. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
Poorly soluble vitamin K cannot be absorbed by patients suffering from cholestasis due to extremely low level of bile salts in the intestine. A formulation of vitamin K including glycocholic acid (i.e. Konakion® MM), does not increase bioavailability because it is unstable due to protonation of glycocholic acid at gastric pH. To develop a stable formulation, saponins were introduced as neutral surfactants to (partly) replace glycocholic acid. Experimental design was made to investigate the effect of the composition on particle size at neutral pH and upon acidification at pH 1.5. Two formulations that were within the optimized composition window were loaded with vitamin K and those showed superior stability at low pH as compared to Konakion® MM: sizes were between 43 and 46 nm at pH 7.3 and between 46 and 58 nm after 1 h incubation at pH 1.5, respectively, but large aggregates were formed at pH 1.5 in presence of Konakion® MM. Micelles were cytocompatible with Caco-2 cells at concentration of surfactants (saponins and glycocholic acid) up to 0.15 mg/ml. Uptake of vitamin K by Caco-2 cells was 4.2-4.9 nmol/mg protein for saponins-containing formulations and 7.1 nmol/mg protein for Konakion® MM. This, together with the superior stability at low pH, makes saponins-containing mixed micelles promising oral formulations for vitamin K.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) belongs to a large family of growth factors. FGFs use paracrine or endocrine signaling to mediate a myriad of biological and pathophysiological process, including angiogenesis, wound healing, embryonic development, and metabolism regulation. FGF drugs for the treatment of burn and ulcer wounds are now available. The recent discovery of the crucial roles of the endocrine-acting FGF19 subfamily in maintaining homeostasis of bile acid, glucose, and phosphate further extended the activity profile of this family. Here, the applications of recombinant FGFs for the treatment of wounds, diabetes, hypophosphatemia, the development of FGF receptor inhibitors as anti-neoplastic drugs, and the achievements of basic research and applications of FGFs in China are reviewed.
β-Klotho (encoded by Klb) is an obligate coreceptor, mediating both fibroblast growth factor (FGF)15 and FGF21 signaling. Klb-/- mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed (increased) bile acid (BA) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb-/- mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, fed a chow diet focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb-/- mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb-/- mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb-/- mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid, classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity through direct action (mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms (mediating FGF15 signaling that maintains BA level and composition).
Chronic constipation affects millions of Americans, consumes significant healthcare resources, and significantly affects quality of life (QOL). Recently, several new treatment options have become available for the treatment of constipation, including intestinal secretagogues such as lubiprotone, and linaclotide, prokinetics such as prucalopride, and bile acid transporter antagonists. Plecanatide is the newest of the secretagogue class of compounds that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in the USA. It is a guanylate cyclase agonist, and a 16 amino acid synthetic peptide that is a structural analog of human uroguanylin. Two large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessed the efficacy and safety of plecanatide in CIC patients (Rome III). Both doses of plecanatide, 3 mg and 6 mg resulted in a significantly greater percentage of patients who were durable overall complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) responders (primary endpoint) compared with those who received placebo (plecanatide 3 mg, 21.0%; plecanatide 6 mg, 19.5%; placebo, 10.2%; p &lt; 0.001 for each drug dose versus placebo). Plecanatide treatment also significantly reduced the severity of other CIC symptoms (straining effort, stool consistency, bloating). Also, plecanatide-treated patients reported high levels of satisfaction and improved QOL and desire to continue treatment. The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events with plecanatide was low, including rates of diarrhea (5%). Plecanatide is a luminally acting secretagogue that is efficacious and safe for the treatment of CIC. This article provides an overview of plecanatide in the management of adults with CIC.
Investigation of bile acids (BAs) as biomarkers for liver and kidney diseases has gained momentum recently to fulfill the needs in drug development and clinical practice, but a thorough and rapid profiling of BAs in human plasma has been hindered by the large interindividual variability and lack of selective methods.
A selective and efficient UPLC-high resolution mass spectrometry method was developed and fully validated for the definitive profiling of 26 BAs in human plasma with a curve rage of 1-1000 ng/ml and a runtime of 7.2 min.
Four BA combinations with good sensitivity and specificity show potential biomarker applications for liver injury and diseases.
To evaluate the long-term efficacy of cholecystocolostomy surgery for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).
From August 2003 to November 2014, 34 clinically diagnosed children, including 11 with familial intrahepatic cholestasis-1 (FIC1), 13 with bile salt export pump (BSEP) disease, five with low γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) disease (levels &lt;100 U/L), and five with multidrug resistance class III (MDR3) disease with high GGT (&gt;100 U/L), were identified in our center. Data were collected retrospectively from individuals who collectively had 36 surgical operations and two orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT).
Serum total bilirubin (0 = 163.54 ± 106.02, 36 months = 23.38 ± 17.66 μmol/L) and bile acid (0 = 325.83 ± 153.09, 36 months = 48.36 ± 79.71 μmol/L) decreased after cholecystocolostomy in PFIC patients (P &lt; 0.001). All patients experienced decreased severity of pruritus (88.2% vs. 16.1%, P &lt; 0.001) and a greater freedom from growth retardation after cholecystocolostomy (-3.35 vs. -1.03, P &lt; 0.001). Defecation frequency increased in PFIC patients after cholecystocolostomy (P = 0.002). Four patients (three with FIC1 and one with BSEP) experienced recurrence of cholestasis and two underwent reoperation. Two BSEP patients underwent OLT. One patient with BSEP and one patient with MDR3 died due to severe diarrhea and dehydration; one BSEP patient died of intractable constipation.
This is the first long-term, large-scale analysis of cholecystocolostomy approaches for PFIC. Approaches single and well tolerated, and generally result in improvement of pruritus and cholestasis.
Bile acid is a general term for a large class of cholic acid in bile and exerts its unique physiological functions by binding the relevant receptors and bile acid transporters. Bile acids not only promote the absorption of nutrients in the human body, but also as an important signaling molecule in the regulation of inflammatory processes and liver regeneration. Several studies have found that bile acid metabolism is involved in the occurrence and development of chronic non-cholestatic liver diseases. In this article, the latest research results are mentioned, and the relationship between nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, and bile acid transporters and chronic non-cholestatic liver disease that play a key role in the bile acid metabolism were emphatically reviewed.
胆汁酸是胆汁中一大类胆烷酸的总称，通过与相关受体及胆汁酸转运蛋白结合，发挥其独特的生理功能。人体内胆汁酸除促进营养物质的吸收外，还作为重要的信号分子调节炎症过程、肝脏再生，并且越来越多的研究结果提示胆汁酸代谢参与慢性非胆汁淤积性肝病发生、发展的重要环节。该文在介绍上述最新研究成果的同时，重点阐述了胆汁酸代谢过程中发挥关键作用的核受体、膜受体及胆汁酸转运蛋白与慢性非胆汁淤积性肝病的关系。.
Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been identified as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) receptor, and its overexpression in HepG2 cell lines leads to efficient secretion of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) following challenge with a large dose of cell culture-derived HBV (cHBV) particles. However, NTCP-reconstituted HepG2 cells are inefficiently infected by patient serum-derived HBV (sHBV) and release very little hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) following cHBV infection, unlike differentiated HepaRG cells, which are naturally susceptible to both cHBV and sHBV particles. Here, we investigated whether NTCP could explain the different behaviors of the two cell types. Endogenous NTCP protein from differentiated HepaRG cells was unglycosylated despite wild-type coding sequence. HepaRG cells stably transfected with an epitope-tagged NTCP expression construct displayed higher sHBV but not cHBV susceptibility than cells transfected with the null mutant. Tagged NTCP introduced to both HepG2 and HepaRG cells was glycosylated, with N5 and N11 being sites of N-linked glycosylation. Mutating N5, N11, or both did not alter cell surface availability of NTCP or its subcellular localization, with both the singly glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms still capable of mediating cHBV infection in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, nonglycosylated NTCP is expressed by differentiated HepaRG cells and capable of mediating cHBV infection in HepG2 cells, but it cannot explain differential susceptibility of HepaRG and HepG2/NTCP cells to cHBV versus sHBV infection and different HBsAg/HBeAg ratios following cHBV infection. The responsible host factor(s) remains to be identified.IMPORTANCE HBV can infect differentiated HepaRG cells and also HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP, the currently accepted HBV receptor. However, HepG2/NTCP cells remain poorly susceptible to patient serum-derived HBV particles and release very little hepatitis B surface antigen following infection by cell culture-derived HBV. We found differentiated HepaRG cells expressed nonglycosylated NTCP despite a wild-type coding sequence. NTCP introduced to HepG2 cells was glycosylated at two N-linked glycosylation sites, but mutating either or both sites failed to prevent infection by cell culture-derived HBV or to confer susceptibility to serum-derived HBV. Overexpressing NTCP in HepRG cells did not increase infection by cell culture-derived HBV or distort the ratio between the two viral antigens. These findings suggest that host factors unique to HepaRG cells are required for efficient infection by serum-derived HBV, and factors other than NTCP contribute to balanced viral antigen production following infection by cell culture-derived HBV.
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent environmental contaminants with well characterized toxicities in host organs. Gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of xenobiotic biotransformation; however, little is known about its interactions with PBDEs. Primary bile acids (BAs) are metabolized by the gut microbiome into more lipophilic secondary BAs that may be absorbed and interact with certain host receptors. The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that PBDEs cause dysbiosis and aberrant regulation of BA homeostasis. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice were orally gavaged with corn oil (10 mg/kg), BDE-47 (100 μmol/kg), or BDE-99 (100 μmol/kg) once daily for 4 days (n = 3-5/group). Gut microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing of the large intestinal content in CV mice. Both BDE-47 and BDE-99 profoundly decreased the alpha diversity of gut microbiome and differentially regulated 45 bacterial species. Both PBDE congeners increased Akkermansia muciniphila and Erysipelotrichaceae Allobaculum spp., which have been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antiobesity functions. Targeted metabolomics of 56 BAs was conducted in serum, liver, and small and large intestinal content of CV and GF mice. BDE-99 increased many unconjugated BAs in multiple biocompartments in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. This correlated with an increase in microbial 7α-dehydroxylation enzymes for secondary BA synthesis and increased expression of host intestinal transporters for BA absorption. Targeted proteomics showed that PBDEs downregulated host BA-synthesizing enzymes and transporters in livers of CV but not GF mice. In conclusion, there is a novel interaction between PBDEs and the endogenous BA-signaling through modification of the "gut-liver axis".
Current anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents have limited effect in curing HBV infection, and thus novel anti-HBV agents with different modes of action are in demand. In this study, we applied AlphaScreen assay to high-throughput screening of small molecules inhibiting the interaction between HBV large surface antigen (LHBs) and the HBV entry receptor, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). From the chemical screening, we identified that rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, strongly inhibited the LHBs-NTCP interaction. Rapamycin inhibited hepatocyte infection with HBV without significant cytotoxicity. This activity was due to impaired attachment of the LHBs preS1 domain to cell surface. Pretreatment of target cells with rapamycin remarkably reduced their susceptibility to preS1 attachment, while rapamycin pretreatment to preS1 did not affect its attachment activity, suggesting that rapamycin targets the host side. In support of this, a surface plasmon resonance analysis showed a direct interaction of rapamycin with NTCP. Consistently, rapamycin also prevented hepatitis D virus infection, whose entry into cells is also mediated by NTCP. We also identified two rapamycin derivatives, everolimus and temsirolimus, which possessed higher anti-HBV potencies than rapamycin. Thus, this is the first report for application of AlphaScreen technology that monitors a viral envelope-receptor interaction to identify viral entry inhibitors.
Colloidal phases (self-assemblies) in aqueous dispersions of selected binary bile salt/phospholipid blends were studied utilizing the combined analytical approach of asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) in order to resolve the co-existence of different colloidal assemblies. The binary blends were prepared by freeze-drying from tert-butanol/water co-solvent solutions. The blends contained one of two bile salts (sodium taurocholate (TC) or sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDX)) and a mono- or di-acyl phospholipid (lyso-phosphatidylcholine (L-PC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), respectively). Bile salt and phospholipid (PL) concentrations and their respective ratios were varied systematically within the physiological range found in human intestinal fluids. Furthermore, the BCS class II drug Celecoxib was incorporated in selected blends to assess its potential impact on colloidal phases. To further investigate the smallest self-assemblies observed in AF4/MALLS analysis, dispersions of TC and GDX, respectively, were prepared and analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). AF4/MALLS analysis revealed that binary bile-salt/phospholipid blends form three distinct particle fractions, when the concentration of bile-salt was sufficiently high (≥3.5 mM). Those fractions were assumed to be very small pure bile-salt dimeric/oligomeric self-assemblies (Ø ≈ 2-3 nm), mid-sized mixed micelles (Ø ≈ 10-50 nm) and large liposomes/aggregates (Ø ≈ 150-280 nm). If present, Celecoxib was found solubilized within the structures, but at the lowest TC concentration triggered the formation of an additional (vesicular) phase.
A Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, catalase- and oxidase-positive, facultatively anaerobic, and motile bacterium, designated strain SZDIS-1T, was isolated from pigpen sawdust bedding in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China. Cells grew at 10-50 °C, pH 6.0-9.0, up to 12 % (w/v) NaCl, resisted vibriostatic agent O/129 and were negative for gelatin and alginate hydrolysis. No growth on thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar medium. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and multilocus sequence analysis, this strain should be assigned to the genus Vibrio, with the closest relatives being Vibrio aphrogenes CA-1004T (97.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence pairwise similarity), Vibrio algivorus SA2T (96.6 %), Vibrio casei WS 4539T (96.3 %), Vibrio rumoiensis S-1T (96.1 %) and Vibrio litoralis MANO22DT (95.5 %), but separate from them by large distances in different phylogenetic trees. Based on whole genome analysis, the orthologous average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values against the five relatives were 76.1-78.7 and 20.1-28.7 %. The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c), C16 : 0, summed feature 2 (one or more of C12 : 0 aldehyde, C14 : 0 3OH and/or iso-C16 : 1) and summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω6c and/or C18 : 1ω7c). The DNA G+C content was 43.0 mol% from whole genomic sequence analysis. Therefore, phylogenetic, genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics showed that the isolate represented a novel species of the genus Vibrio, for which the name Vibrio gangliei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SZDIS-1T (=DSM 104291T=CGMCC 1.15236T).
Studies at the genomewide level of Parkinson's disease (PD) suggested a significant association between the Hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta isomerase 7 (HSD3B7) gene rs9938550 variant and a decreased risk for PD. But its effect has only been discussed in Caucasian populations, and no phenotypic characteristics were included. To investigate the novel variant for PD in Chinese Han populations, we performed an association analysis of rs9938550 variant in a large cohort.
Using a case-control methodology, a total of 2,239 subjects (1,072 sporadic patients with PD and 1,167 control) were genotyped and the genetic association was analyzed.
No significant association was found between allele A of rs9938550 and PD in the entire cohort (p = .079). However, the frequency of allele A was lower in late-onset PD (LOPD) as compared with controls older than 50 years (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.45-0.85, padjust = .002). Relatively lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores were demonstrated in mid- to late-stage PD with GA + AA genotypes than GG genotype (padjust = .018), while other clinical features were similar between carriers and noncarriers.
Our results support that the HSD3B7 rs9938550 variant, which is likely linked to bile acid biosynthesis, reduces the risk of LOPD in Chinese patients and might induce a benign clinical performance.
Sleep plays an important role in cardiometabolic health. The sleep-wake cycle is partially driven by the endogenous circadian clock, which governs a range of metabolic pathways. The association between sleep and cardiometabolic health may be mediated by alterations of the human metabolome.
To better understand the biological mechanism underlying the association between sleep and health, we examined human plasma metabolites in relation to sleep duration and sleep timing.
Using an untargeted approach, 329 fasting plasma metabolites were measured in 277 Chinese participants. We measured sleep timing (midpoint between bedtime and wake up time) using repeated time-use surveys (4 weeks during one year) and previous night sleep duration from questionnaires completed before sample donation.
We found 64 metabolites that were associated with sleep timing with a false discovery rate of 0.2 or lower, after adjusting for potential confounders. Notably, we found that later sleep timing was associated with higher levels of multiple metabolites in amino acid metabolism, including branched chain amino acids and their gamma-glutamyl dipeptides. We also found widespread associations between sleep timing and numerous metabolites in lipid metabolism, including bile acids, carnitines and fatty acids. In contrast, previous night sleep duration was not associated with plasma metabolites in our study.
Sleep timing was associated with a large number of metabolites across a variety of biochemical pathways. Some metabolite associations are consistent with a relationship between late chronotype and adverse effects on cardiometabolic health.
The outer membranes (OM) of many Gram-negative bacteria contain general porins, which form nonspecific, large-diameter channels for the diffusional uptake of small molecules required for cell growth and function. While the porins of Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., E. coli OmpF and OmpC) have been extensively characterized structurally and biochemically, much less is known about their counterparts in Vibrionaceae. Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, has two major porins, OmpU and OmpT, for which no structural information is available despite their importance for the bacterium. Here we report high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of V. cholerae OmpU and OmpT complemented with molecular dynamics simulations. While similar overall to other general porins, the channels of OmpU and OmpT have unusual constrictions that create narrower barriers for small-molecule permeation and change the internal electric fields of the channels. Together with electrophysiological and in vitro transport data, our results illuminate small-molecule uptake within the Vibrionaceae.
Prevalence of diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, is growing worldwide. The majority of the cases belong to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Globally, India ranks second in terms of diabetes prevalence among adults. Currently available classes of therapeutic agents are used alone or in combinations but seldom achieve treatment targets. Diverse pathophysiology and the need of therapeutic agents with more favourable pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics profile make newer drug discoveries in the field of T2DM essential. A large number of molecules, some with novel mechanisms, are in pipeline. The essence of this review is to track and discuss these potential agents, based on their developmental stages, especially those in phase 3 or phase 2. Unique molecules are being developed for existing drug classes like insulins, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogues; and under newer classes like dual/pan PPAR agonists, dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors, glimins, anti-inflammatory agents, glucokinase activators, G-protein coupled receptor agonists, hybrid peptide agonists, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitors, glucagon receptor antagonists etc. The heterogeneous clinical presentation and therapeutic outcomes in phenotypically similar patients is a clue to think beyond the standard treatment strategy.
The nuclear receptor FXR regulates the expression of genes involved in bile acids, glucose and lipid homeostasis. For its role as guardian of metabolism, FXR has been identified a promising pharmacological target in liver bile acid and lipid accumulation, such as cholestasis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The field of FXR research is extremely competitive with a large number of patents and articles published in the last decades identifying promising hit compounds.
The present review summarizes recent patent activity (2014-to date) filing for synthetic and natural FXR ligands, including bile acid derivatives and non-steroidal compounds, alongside their in vitro and in vivo efficacy as well as their therapeutic applications.
While the first FXR agonist, obeticholic acid, has gained approval, significant safety issues have been emerged. Today is unclear whether these safety issues are class related or restricted to the bile acid scaffold of this agent. Despite the significant number of patent applications claiming steroidal and non-steroidal FXR agonists, several questions on their therapeutic potential in cholestasis and NASH remain open leaving a space for the development of novel compounds.
The in vitro prebiotic effects of resistant starch (RS), prepared by different treatments from purple yam, on Bifidobacterium adolescentis (bifidobacteria for short), were investigated. Tolerance tests indicated that bifidobacteria in PDS (prepared by debranching combined with autoclaving) and PDS.H (PDS further treated by double enzyme hydrolysis) media adapted better to simulated upper gastrointestinal conditions (at pH 1.5-3.0 and 0.3% and 1.0% bile acid) than those in GLU (glucose) and DAS (prepared by autoclaving) media. PDS.H, which had the highest digestion resistibility, exhibited significant effects on the OD600 nm value (1.544) and the pH value (4.21) when the carbohydrate concentration was 20 g L-1. Additionally, the exponential growth phase of bifidobacteria was 2 h in the PDS or PDS.H media, whereas it was 4 h in the GLU or DAS media. A higher content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was obtained in the PDS.H medium. Analysis of the structural features of RS and fermented RS indicated that PDS, especially PDS.H, had a rougher surface and higher crystallinity than DAS. Fermented RS in a simulated large bowel environment showed an eroded surface and decreased crystallinity. All of these findings suggest that RS with a rough surface and perfect crystalline structure could protect bifidobacteria from gastrointestinal conditions and enhance the proliferation of bifidobacteria.
Unusual bile acids (1β-hydroxylated bile acids), particularly 1β-hydroxyl-cholic acid (CA-1β-ol) and 1β-hydroxyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA-1β-ol), have been detected in the urine of infants. These acids are conjugated with amino acids, such as taurine, and are then excreted mainly via the urine. CA-1β-ol and CDCA-1β-ol are the predominant bile acids during infancy and are present in relatively large amounts in the urine. However, the biosynthetic pathway of 1β-hydroxylated bile acids in infants remains unclear. To investigate the biosynthetic pathway of 1β-hydroxylated bile acids during infancy, we performed a metabolic reaction using infant hepatocytes at 3 months after delivery. Glyco- and tauro-CA-1β-ol were identified by LC/tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of the extracted culture medium incubated with cholic acids (CAs). Further, we identified that ketoconazole suppressed CA 1β-hydroxylation and that the CYP3A subfamily was the primary group of enzymes responsible for CA-1β-ol formation. The present study provides new information about the biosynthetic pathway of 1β-hydroxylated bile acids during infancy.
The bile acid-sensitive ion channel is activated by amphiphilic substances such as bile acids or artificial detergents via membrane alterations; however, the mechanism of membrane sensitivity of the bile acid-sensitive ion channel is not known. It has also not been systematically investigated whether other members of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (DEG/ENaC) gene family are affected by amphiphilic compounds. Here, we show that DEG/ENaCs ASIC1a, ASIC3, ENaC, and the purinergic receptor P2X2 are modulated by a large number of different, structurally unrelated amphiphilic substances, namely the detergents N-lauroylsarcosine, Triton X-100, and β-octylglucoside; the fenamate flufenamic acid; the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine; the natural phenol resveratrol; the chili pepper compound capsaicin; the loop diuretic furosemide; and the antiarrythmic agent verapamil. We determined the modification of membrane properties using large-angle x-ray diffraction experiments on model lipid bilayers, revealing that the amphiphilic compounds are positioned in a characteristic fashion either in the lipid tail group region or in the lipid head group region, demonstrating that they perturbed the membrane structure. Collectively, our results show that DEG/ENaCs and structurally related P2X receptors are modulated by diverse amphiphilic molecules. Furthermore, they suggest alterations of membrane properties by amphiphilic compounds as a mechanism contributing to modulation.
Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is associated with food-borne outbreaks of diarrhea and growth faltering among children in developing countries. A Shiga toxin-producing EAEC strain of serotype O104:H4 strain caused one of the largest outbreaks of a food-borne infection in Europe in 2011. The outbreak was traced to contaminated fenugreek sprouts, yet the mechanisms whereby such persistent contamination of sprouts could have occurred are not clear. We found that under ambient conditions of temperature and in minimal media, pathogenic Shiga toxin-producing EAEC O104:H4 227-11 and non-Shiga toxin-producing 042 strains both produce high levels of exopolysaccharide structures (EPS) that are released to the external milieu. The exopolysaccharide was identified as colanic acid (CA). Unexpectedly, Shiga-toxin producing EAEC strain 227-11 produced 3-6-fold higher levels of CA than the 042 strain, suggesting differential regulation of the CA in the two strains. The presence of CA was accompanied by the formation of large biofilm structures on the surface of sprouts. The wcaF-wza chromosomal locus was required for the synthesis of CA in EAEC 042. Deletion in the glycosyltransferase wcaE gene abolished the production of CA in 042, and resulted in diminished adherence to sprouts when co-cultured at ambient temperature. In conclusion, this work suggests that copious production of CA may contribute to persistence of EAEC in the environment and suggests a potential explanation for the large Shiga toxin-producing EAEC outbreak in 2011.
We attempted to clarify the therapeutic capability of antagonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor that regulates lipid and bile acid metabolism. Herein, we report the antidyslipidemic effects of a novel synthesized FXR antagonist, compound-T1, utilizing a dyslipidemic hamster model. Compound-T1 selectively inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid-induced FXR activation (IC 50, 2.1 nmol·L-1). A hamster model of diet-induced hyperlipidemia was prepared to investigate the antidyslipidemic effects of compound-T1 through comparative studies of the nonstatin lipid-modulating agents ezetimibe, cholestyramine, and torcetrapib. In the hamster model, compound-T1 (6 mg·kg-1·day-1, p.o.) increased the level of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (+22.2%) and decreased the levels of plasma non-HDL-cholesterol (-43.6%) and triglycerides (-31.1%). Compound-T1 also increased hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression and fecal bile acid excretion, and decreased hepatic cholesterol content. Moreover, the hamster model could reflect clinical results of other nonstatin agents. Torcetrapib especially increased large HDL particles compared with compound-T1. Additionally, in the human hepatoma Huh-7 cells, compound-T1 enhanced apolipoprotein A-I secretion at a concentration close to its IC 50 value for FXR. Our results indicated the usefulness of the hamster model in evaluating FXR antagonists and nonstatin agents. Notably, compound-T1 exhibited beneficial effects on both blood non-HDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, which are thought to involve enhancement of cholesterol catabolism and apolipoprotein A-I production. These findings aid the understanding of the antidyslipidemic potential of FXR antagonists with a unique lipid and bile acid modulation.
Bile acids or bile salts, belong to a large family of biological steroid derivatives found predominantly in the bile of mammals and other vertebrates. These amphipathic molecules possess numerous functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate catabolites, emulsifying fat-soluble vitamins to enable their absorption, aiding in motility and in reducing the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract. In this review, we investigate progress towards synthetic bile acid derivatives, with special emphasis on how they might be used for various biological applications and the challenges that remain in developing these compounds as potent drugs of the future especially in the field of microbiology (antimicrobial activities) and cancer (anticancer agents). We will emphasize the fact that even few researches are devoted around these peculiar structures. All the researches pointed out the important potential of such derivatives for the design of new classes of drugs.
Large-scale microbiome studies have established that most of the diversity contained in the gastrointestinal tract is represented at the strain level; however, exhaustive genomic and physiological characterization of human isolates is still lacking. With increased use of probiotics as interventions for gastrointestinal disorders, genomic and functional characterization of novel microorganisms becomes essential. In this study, we explored the impact of strain-level genomic variability on bacterial physiology of two novel human Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains (AMC143 and AMC010) of probiotic potential in relation to stress resistance. The strains showed differences with known probiotic strains (L. rhamnosus GG, Lc705, and HN001) at the genomic level, including nucleotide polymorphisms, mutations in non-coding regulatory regions, and rearrangements of genomic architecture. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that gene expression profiles differed between strains when exposed to simulated gastrointestinal stresses, suggesting the presence of unique regulatory systems in each strain. In vitro physiological assays to test resistance to conditions mimicking the gut environment (acid, alkali, and bile stress) showed that growth of L. rhamnosus AMC143 was inhibited upon exposure to alkaline pH, while AMC010 and control strain LGG were unaffected. AMC143 also showed a significant survival advantage compared to the other strains upon bile exposure. Reverse transcription qPCR targeting the bile salt hydrolase gene (bsh) revealed that AMC143 expressed bsh poorly (a consequence of a deletion in the bsh promoter and truncation of bsh gene in AMC143), while AMC010 had significantly higher expression levels than AMC143 or LGG. Insertional inactivation of the bsh gene in AMC010 suggested that bsh could be detrimental to bacterial survival during bile stress. Together, these findings show that coupling of classical microbiology with functional genomics methods for the characterization of bacterial strains is critical for the development of novel probiotics, as variability between strains can dramatically alter bacterial physiology and functionality.
Black tea is a highly popular beverage, and its pigments, polymerized catechins such as theaflavins (TFs), are attracting attention due to their beneficial health effects. In this study, to test the inhibitory activities of TFs on the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, we investigated their effects on phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles in the absence or presence of a bile salt. (-)-Epicatechin gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, and TFs formed insoluble complexes with PC vesicles. Galloylated TFs such as TF2A, TF2B, and TF3 precipitated far more than other polyphenols. The subsequent addition of taurocholate redispersed the polyphenol-PC complexes, except that a large amount of TF2A remained insoluble. After incubation with taurocholate-PC micelles, TF2A elevated the turbidity of the micelle solution, providing red sediments. The TF2A-specific effect was dependent on the PC concentration. These results suggest that TF2A interacts with PC and aggregates in a specific manner different from catechins and other TFs.
Diseases that affect the eye, including photoreceptor degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, affect 11.8 million people in the US, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Loss of sight affects patient quality of life and puts an economic burden both on individuals and the greater healthcare system. Despite the urgent need for treatments, few effective options currently exist in the clinic. Here, we review research on promising neuroprotective strategies that promote neuronal survival with the potential to protect against vision loss and retinal cell death. Due to the large number of neuroprotective strategies, we restricted our review to approaches that we had direct experience with in the laboratory. We focus on drugs that target survival pathways, including bile acids like UDCA and TUDCA, steroid hormones like progesterone, therapies that target retinal dopamine, and neurotrophic factors. In addition, we review rehabilitative methods that increase endogenous repair mechanisms, including exercise and electrical stimulation therapies. For each approach, we provide background on the neuroprotective strategy, including history of use in other diseases; describe potential mechanisms of action; review the body of research performed in the retina thus far, both in animals and in humans; and discuss considerations when translating each treatment to the clinic and to the retina, including which therapies show the most promise for each retinal disease. Despite the high incidence of retinal diseases and the complexity of mechanisms involved, several promising neuroprotective treatments provide hope to prevent blindness. We discuss attractive candidates here with the goal of furthering retinal research in critical areas to rapidly translate neuroprotective strategies into the clinic.
Pigs are one of the most important economic livestock. Gut microbiota is not only critical to the health but also the production efficiency of pigs. Manipulating gut microbiota relies on the full view of gut microbiome and the understanding of drive forces shaping microbial communities. 16s rDNA sequencing was used to profile microbiota along the longitudinal and radical axes to obtain the topographical map of microbiome in different intestinal compartments in young pigs. Alpha and beta-diversities revealed distinct differences in microbial compositions between the distal ileum and cecum and colon, as well as between the lumen and mucosa. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated in the ileum, constituting 95 and 80% of the luminal and mucosa-attached microbiome. Transitioning from the small intestine to the large intestine, luminal Bacteroidetes increased from 1.69 to 45.98% in the cecum and 40.09% in the colon, while mucosal Bacteroidetes raised from 9 to 35.36% and 27.96%. Concurrently, luminal Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and mucosal-attached Proteobacteria remarkably decreased. By co-occurrence network analyses, Prevotellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Veillonellaceae were recognized as the central nodes of luminal microbial network, and Prevotellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Enterococcaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae were identified as mucosal central nodes. Co-abundance was uncovered among Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Veillonellaceae in the luminal and mucosal microbiome, while opportunistic pathogens from γ-Proteobacteria in the mucosa. Strong co-exclusion was shown between Enterobacteriaceae with Prevotellaceae-centered microbial groups in the lumen. Redundancy analysis found bile acids and short chain fatty acids explained 37.1 and 41% of variations in the luminal microbial composition, respectively. Primary bile acid, taurine- and glycine- conjugated bile acids were positively correlated with Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae_1, Peptostreptococcaceae, whereas secondary bile acids, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate were positively correlated with Prevotellaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Desulfovibronaceae, Veillonellaceae. Functional analyses demonstrated that Prevotella, Veillonellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with gene functions related to amino acids, energy, cofactors and vitamins metabolism, which are indispensable for the hosts. These results suggested site specific colonization and co-occurrence of swine gut microbiome closely relate to the microenvironment in each niche. Interactions of core gut microbiome greatly contributed to metabolism and/or immunity in the swine intestine.
Listeria monocytogenes uses a variety of transcriptional regulation strategies to adapt to the extra-host environment, the gastrointestinal tract, and the intracellular host environment. While the alternative sigma factor SigB has been proposed to be a key transcriptional regulator that facilitates L. monocytogenes adaptation to the gastrointestinal environment, the L. monocytogenes' transcriptional response to bile exposure is not well-understood. RNA-seq characterization of the bile stimulon was performed in two L. monocytogenes strains representing lineages I and II. Exposure to bile at pH 5.5 elicited a large transcriptomic response with ~16 and 23% of genes showing differential transcription in 10403S and H7858, respectively. The bile stimulon includes genes involved in motility and cell wall modification mechanisms, as well as genes in the PrfA regulon, which likely facilitate survival during the gastrointestinal stages of infection that follow bile exposure. The fact that bile exposure induced the PrfA regulon, but did not induce further upregulation of the SigB regulon (beyond that expected by exposure to pH 5.5), suggests a model where at the earlier stages of gastrointestinal infection (e.g., acid exposure in the stomach), SigB-dependent gene expression plays an important role. Subsequent exposure to bile induces the PrfA regulon, potentially priming L. monocytogenes for subsequent intracellular infection stages. Some members of the bile stimulon showed lineage- or strain-specific distribution when 27 Listeria genomes were analyzed. Even though sigB null mutants showed increased sensitivity to bile, the SigB regulon was not found to be upregulated in response to bile beyond levels expected by exposure to pH 5.5. Comparison of wildtype and corresponding ΔsigB strains newly identified 26 SigB-dependent genes, all with upstream putative SigB-dependent promoters.
The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a nonhuman primate that is used for preclinical research on stem cell transplantation therapies due to its similarity to human beings as well as its small size, enabling researchers to perform experiments without preparing a large number of cells. In this study, we developed a marmoset hepatic fibrosis model for regenerative medicine research. Six female marmosets aged 4-6 years were administered thioacetamide (TAA) at a dose of 2.5-40 mg/kg two or three times a week. Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by liver biopsy when blood chemistry indicated liver damage. Administration of TAA increased total bile acid, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin and decreased serum albumin levels. Following more than 11 weeks of continuous injection of TAA, histological analyses detected hepatic fibrosis in all animals. Type IV collagen 7S serum levels in animals with hepatic fibrosis were significantly higher than in normal animals as a possible marker of hepatic fibrosis in marmosets. Serial liver biopsies following the last administration of TAA revealed that induced fibrosis remained up to 11 weeks. The results suggest that continuous TAA administration induces persistent hepatic fibrosis in the common marmoset and this nonhuman primate hepatic fibrosis model have the possibility to evaluate the therapeutic effects of test samples to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis.
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune cholangiopathy characterized by a selective destruction of biliary epithelial cells of small and medium caliber hepatic ducts, which mainly affects women. The main symptoms are fatigue and pruritus, however, a large proportion of patients may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis is based on AMA titers &gt;1:40, alkaline phosphatase &gt;1.5 times the upper limit for more than 24 weeks and compatible liver histology. It is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases mainly extrahepatic, thyroid diseases, bone diseases, among others. The first line treatment is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), that improves liver function tests and delay the progression to cirrhosis. Currently, there are new treatments and adjuvant therapies on study. The purpose of this review is to offer an update in this topic, which is very important in gastroenterology and internal medicine. We formed an interdisciplinary team to search in the database Medline thorough PubMed with the key words describe below, we made a critical lecture of the titles and abstracts of each article to write this paper.
Peroxisome houses a large number of enzymes involved in lipid and phytochemical oxidation as well as synthesis of bile acid and other specialized lipids. Peroxisome resident enzymes are imported into the organelle via a conserved cargo transport system composed of many peroxins, protein factors essential for the biogenesis of peroxisome. Among the peroxins, PEX5 plays a transporter role, and PEX2, 10, and 12 are thought to form a complex that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to help recycle PEX5 in an ubiquitin modification-dependent process. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of peroxins in postnatal development especially the development of nerve systems. These studies also show that peroxins or the function of peroxisomes is dispensable for cellular viability. In contrast, however, we report here that PEX2 and other peroxins are essential for the viability of liver cancer cells, probably through altering metabolism and signaling pathways. Our results suggest that peroxins may be potential targets of therapeutics against liver cancer.
To improve understanding of pathophysiologic processes occurring in green sea turtles ( Chelonia mydas) stranded along the east coast of Australia, we retrospectively examined the hematologic and biochemical blood parameters of 127 green turtles admitted to 2 rehabilitation facilities, Dolphin Marine Magic (DMM) and Taronga Zoo (TZ), between 2002 and 2016. The predominant size class presented was small immature animals (SIM), comprising 88% and 69% of admissions to DMM and TZ, respectively. Significant differences in blood profiles were noted between facility, size, and outcome. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and heterophils were poor prognostic indicators in animals from TZ, but not DMM. SIM animals at both institutions had lower protein levels than large older (LO) animals. SIM animals at DMM also had lower hematocrit and monocyte concentration; SIM animals at TZ had lower heterophil counts. Urea was measured for 27 SIM animals from TZ, but the urea-to-uric acid ratio was not prognostically useful. Strong correlations were seen between AST and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; r = 0.68) and uric acid and bile acids ( r = 0.72) in the 45 SIM animals from DMM in which additional analytes were measured. χ2 contingency tests showed that the most recently published reference intervals were not prognostically useful. A paired t-test showed that protein levels rose and heterophil numbers fell in the 15 SIM animals from TZ during the rehabilitation process. Our results indicate that further work is required to identify reliable prognostic biomarkers for green turtles.
Left-censored missing values commonly exist in targeted metabolomics datasets and can be considered as missing not at random (MNAR). Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets. The R code for GSimp, evaluation pipeline, tutorial, real-world and simulated targeted metabolomics datasets are available at: https://github.com/WandeRum/GSimp.
Kale (Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family, and kale leaves have large amounts of dietary fiber and polyphenolics. Dietary fiber can bind bile acids, thus potentially decreasing cholesterol levels; however, whether the polyphenols from kale contribute to in vitro bile acid binding capacity remains unclear. In the present study, kale was extracted with hexane, acetone, and MeOH : water and the dried extracts, as well as the fiber-rich residue, were tested for their bile acid binding capacity. The fiber-rich residue bound total bile acids in amounts equivalent to that bound by raw kale. The lyophilized acetone extract bound significantly more glycochenodeoxycholate and glycodeoxycholate and less of other bile acids. To test whether bile acid binding enhanced the bioaccessibility of polyphenolic compounds from kale, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify chemical constituents and measure their bioaccessibility in an in vitro digestion reaction. This identified 36 phenolic compounds in kale, including 18 kaempferol derivatives, 13 quercetin derivatives, 4 sinapoyl derivatives, and one caffeoylquinic acid. The bioaccessibility of these phenolics was significantly higher (69.4%) in digestions with bile acids. Moreover, bile acids enhanced the bioaccessibility of quercetin by 25 times: only 2.7% of quercetin derivatives were bioaccessible in the digestion without bile acids, but with bile acids, their accessibility increased to 69.5%. Bile acids increased the bioaccessibility of kaempferol from 37.7% to 69.2%. The extractability and biostability of total phenolics in the digested residue increased 1.8 fold in the digestions with bile acids. These results demonstrated the potential use of kale to improve human health.
