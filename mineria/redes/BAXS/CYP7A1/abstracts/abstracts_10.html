Streptococcus mutans is known to produce biofilm which is one of the primary causes of dental caries. Acid production and acid tolerance along with exopolysaccharide (EPS) formation are major virulence factors of S. mutans biofilm. In the current study, calcium fluoride nanoparticles (CaF2-NPs) were evaluated for their effect on the biofilm forming ability of S. mutans in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro studies revealed 89 % and 90 % reduction in biofilm formation and EPS production, respectively. Moreover, acid production and acid tolerance abilities of S. mutans were also reduced considerably in the presence of CaF2-NPs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images were in accordance with the other results indicating inhibition of biofilm without affecting bacterial viability. The qRT-PCR gene expression analysis showed significant downregulation of various virulence genes (vicR, gtfC, ftf, spaP, comDE) associated with biofilm formation. Furthermore, CaF2-NPs were found to substantially decrease the caries in treated rat groups as compared to the untreated groups in in vivo studies. Scanning electron micrographs of rat's teeth further validated our results. These findings suggest that the CaF2-NPs may be used as a potential antibiofilm applicant against S. mutans and may be applied as a topical agent to reduce dental caries.
Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) was introduced in 1980s in the field of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies indicate that symptoms of SCT are separate from symptoms of ADHD and independently associated with multiple domains of functioning in clinical groups and in typical development. We assessed whether similar pattern would apply to higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Children with higher functioning ASD (N = 55; 5-15 years) were divided into the ASD+High SCT (n = 17), the ASD+Medium SCT (n = 18) and the ASD+Low SCT (n = 20) groups based on parent-rated daydreaming and slowness on the Five to Fifteen questionnaire (FTF). The groups were compared on SCT-related impairments found in previous studies: social skills, academic functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and processing speed. Assessment methods were the FTF, the Development and Well-Being Assessment, and the Coding subtest of the WISC-III. The ADHD symptoms were statistically controlled due to the overlap between SCT and ADHD. The ASD+High SCT and ASD+Medium SCT groups were significantly more likely to have the most pronounced social impairments, and the ASD+High SCT group had significantly higher rate of internalizing disorders compared to the ASD+Low SCT group. Our results suggest that children with higher functioning ASD and high or medium levels of SCT symptoms could be at higher risk for psychosocial impairments than children with higher functioning ASD with low levels of SCT symptoms. Co-occurring ADHD symptoms do not explain the finding. Recognizing SCT symptoms in higher functioning ASD would be important to targeting preventive support.
The thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) receptor (T3R) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors. T3Rs are known to bind as homodimers and heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to two hexameric half-sites in directly repeated, palindromic, and inverted palindromic orientations. The binding of T3R monomers to individual half-sites was often reported, but no clear ligand-induced transactivational activity has been shown. Here, we analyzed interactions of T3R monomers with individual half-sites of the sequence NNAGGTCA. We found that the two nucleotides 5' of the AGGTCA core half-site strongly influence T3R binding and transcriptional activity: octameric half-sites of the consensus sequence (T/C)(A/G)AGGTCA were bound by T3Rs with the highest affinity. This suggests T3R functioning also as a monomeric transcription factor like the orphan nuclear receptors NGFI-B and FTZ-F1. Moreover, we observed that the function of T3R-RXR heterodimers on response elements composed of two half-sites in a directly repeated orientation spaced by 4 nucleotides is determined in major parts by the 5'-flanking sequence of the upstream half-site. Consequently, we noted that the affinity of T3R homodimers is influenced by both 5'-flanking sequences. Our findings suggest that the binding of dimerizing receptors like T3R and other nuclear receptors to their cognate response elements is determined not only by the half-site core sequence, orientation, and number of spacing nucleotides, but also by the nucleotide sequence preceding the half-sites.
In an attempt to understand development and differentiation processes of the parasitic blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were cloned, including SmFtz-F1 (S. mansoni Fushi Tarazu-factor 1). The Ftz-F1 nuclear receptor subfamily only contains orphan receptors that bind to their response element as monomers. Whereas SmFtz-F1 displays these basic functional properties, we have identified an original and specific interaction between SmFtz-F1 and the schistosome RXR homologue, SmRXR1. The mammalian two-hybrid assay showed that the D, E, and F domains of SmFtz-F1 were capable of interacting specifically with the E domain of SmRXR1 but not with that of mouse RXRalpha. Using three-dimensional LBD homology modelling and structure-guided mutagenesis, we were able to demonstrate the essential role of exposed residues located in the dimerization interfaces of both receptors in the maintenance of the interaction. Cotransfection experiments with constructions encoding full-length nuclear receptors show that SmRXR1 potentiates the transcriptional activity of SmFtz-F1 from various promoters. Nevertheless, the lack of identification of a dimeric response element for this SmFtz-F1/SmRXR1 heterodimer seems to indicate a "tethering" mechanism. Thus, our results suggest for the first time that a member of the Ftz-F1 family could heterodimerize functionally with a homologue of the universal heterodimerization partner of nuclear receptors. This unique property confirms that SmFtz-F1 may be involved in the development and differentiation of schistosome-specific structures.
The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) initiates metamorphosis in insects by signaling through the ecdysone receptor complex, a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP). Analysis of usp mutant clones in the wing disc of Drosophila shows that in the absence of USP, early hormone responsive genes such as EcR, DHR3 and E75B fail to up-regulate in response to 20E, but other genes that are normally expressed later, such as (&amp;bgr;)-Ftz-F1 and the Z1 isoform of the Broad-Complex (BRC-Z1), are expressed precociously. Sensory neuron formation and axonal outgrowth, two early metamorphic events, also occur prematurely. In vitro experiments with cultured wing discs showed that BRC-Z1 expression and early metamorphic development are rendered steroid-independent in the usp mutant clones. These results are consistent with a model in which these latter processes are induced by a signal arising during the middle of the last larval stage but suppressed by the unliganded EcR/USP complex. Our observations suggest that silencing by the unliganded EcR/USP receptor and the subsequent release of silencing by moderate steroid levels may play an important role in coordinating early phases of steroid driven development.
Outpatients with tracheostomy can be managed with a low risk for severe airways infections despite colonization with pathogenic bacteria. No studies have been focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition known for recurrent exacerbations. The aim of our study was to verify whether at follow-up in tracheostomized COPD versus other disease outpatients, persistent P. aeruginosa colonization may influence the rate and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) or hospital admissions. Thirty-nine outpatients were considered: 24 were affected by COPD (age 66, 54-78 years, mean, range), 15 by restrictive lung disease (RLD) (57, 41-72 years). During an 18-month follow-up the number of LRTIs were recorded. Bacterial identifications were assessed at baseline and every month for 6 months in bronchial aspirates. The number of LRTI per patient was not significantly different between COPD [37, 1(0-6)] and RLD [18, 1(0-5)], [total, median (range)]. Persistent P. aeruginosa colonized 18 COPD (75%), 12 RLD patients (86%) and was not associated with an increased number of LRTI: 1(0-6) and 1(0-2), respectively. There were no differences in the number of hospital admissions: COPD 0(0-2), RLD 1(0-1), with a significant decrease versus before tracheostomy (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the rate of LRTI and hospital admissions in COPD outpatients with chronic tracheostomy was low, similar to non-COPD patients and independent of P. aeruginosa colonization.
20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) is an aglycone of ginsenosides isolated from Panax ginseng and has several interesting activities, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects. Herein, PPT was identified as an inhibitor against the ligand-dependent transactivation of liver X receptor α (LXRα) using a Gal4-TK-luciferase reporter system. LXRα is a transcription factor of nuclear hormone receptor family and stimulates the transcription of many metabolic genes, such as lipogenesis- or reverse cholesterol transport (RCT)-related genes. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PPT inhibited the LXRα-dependent transcription of lipogenic genes, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1. These inhibitory effects of PPT are, at least in part, a consequence of the reduced recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the LXR response element (LXRE) of the SREBP-1c promoter. Furthermore, LXRα-dependent triglyceride accumulation in primary mouse hepatocytes was significantly reduced by PPT. Interestingly, PPT did not inhibit the LXRα-dependent transcription of ABCA1, a crucial LXRα target gene involved in RCT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PPT repressed recruitment of the lipogenic coactivator TRAP80 to the SREBP-1c LXRE, but not the ABCA1 LXRE. Overall, these data suggest that PPT has selective inhibitory activity against LXRα-mediated lipogenesis, but not LXRα-stimulated RCT. 
Brown fat activates uncoupled respiration in response to cold temperature and contributes to systemic metabolic homeostasis. To date, the metabolic action of brown fat has been primarily attributed to its role in fuel oxidation and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. Whether brown fat engages other tissues through secreted factors remains largely unexplored. Here we show that neuregulin 4 (Nrg4), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of extracellular ligands, is highly expressed in adipose tissues, enriched in brown fat and markedly increased during brown adipocyte differentiation. Adipose tissue Nrg4 expression was reduced in rodent and human obesity. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice demonstrated that Nrg4 protects against diet-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis through attenuating hepatic lipogenic signaling. Mechanistically, Nrg4 activates ErbB3 and ErbB4 signaling in hepatocytes and negatively regulates de novo lipogenesis mediated by LXR and SREBP1c in a cell-autonomous manner. These results establish Nrg4 as a brown fat-enriched endocrine factor with therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity-associated disorders, including type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (C3G), a typical anthocyanin pigment that exists in the human diet, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to detect the effect of C3G on LPS-induced acute lung injury and to investigate the molecular mechanisms. Acute lung injury was induced by intratracheal administration of LPS in mice. Alveolar macrophages from mice were stimulated with LPS and were treated with C3G. Our results showed that C3G attenuated lung histopathologic changes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 production in LPS-induced acute lung injury model. In vitro, C3G dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-β production, as well as NF-κB and IRF3 activation in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, C3G disrupted the formation of lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and inhibited TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts. Moreover, C3G activated LXRα-ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux. Knockout of LXRα abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of C3G. In conclusion, C3G has a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury. The promising anti-inflammatory mechanisms of C3G is associated with up-regulation of the LXRα-ABCG1 pathway which result in disrupting lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and reducing translocation of TLR4 to lipid rafts, thereby suppressing TLR4 mediated inflammatory response. 
Liver X receptor (LXR)α is a nuclear receptor that responds to oxysterols and cholesterol overload by stimulating cholesterol efflux, transport, conversion to bile acids, and excretion. LXRα binds to and is regulated by synthetic (T-0901317, GW3695) and endogenous (oxysterols) ligands. LXRα activity is also modulated by FAs, but the ligand binding specificity of FA and acyl-CoA derivatives for LXRα remains unknown. We investigated whether LXRα binds FA or FA acyl-CoA with affinities that mimic in vivo concentrations, examined the effect of FA chain length and the degree of unsaturation on binding, and investigated whether FAs regulate LXRα activation. Saturated medium-chain FA (MCFA) displayed binding affinities in the low nanomolar concentration range, while long-chain fatty acyl-CoA did not bind or bound weakly to LXRα. Circular dichroic spectra and computational docking experiments confirmed that MCFA bound to the LXRα ligand binding pocket similar to the known synthetic agonist of LXRα (T0901317), but with limited change to the conformation of the receptor. Transactivation assays showed that MCFA activated LXRα, whereas long-chain FA caused no effect. Our results suggest that LXRα functions as a receptor for saturated FA or acyl-CoA of C10 and C12 in length.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that play a crucial role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and inflammation. Recent studies show that LXR agonists exhibit anti-cancer activities in a variety of cancer cell lines including prostate. To further identify the potential mechanisms of LXRα activation on prostate cancer, we investigated the effect of LXR agonist T0901317 on PC3 prostate cancer cell and in which activity of beta-catenin pathway involved.
Prostate cancer PC3 cells were transfected with LXR-a siRNA and treated with LXR activator T0901317. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the LXR-a expression. beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-MYC were analyzed by western blot. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry and Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migration was detected by Transwell chambers.
Data showed that T0901317 significantly inhibited PC3 cell proliferation as well as invasion and increased apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we found that LXRα activation induced the reduction of beta-catenin expression in PC3 cells, and this inhibitory effect could be totally abolished when cells were treated with LXRα. Meanwhile, the expression of beta-catenin target gene cyclin D1 and c-MYC were also decreased.
This study provided additional evidence that LXR activation inhibited PC-3 prostate cancer cells via suppressing beta-catenin pathway.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an important gasotransmitter, is involved in a variety of cellular functions and pathophysiologic processes. Drug resistance due to alterations in drug trafficking and metabolism severely limits the effectiveness of cancer therapy. This study examined the role of H2S in drug resistance in liver cancer cells.
Human primary hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant cells were used in this study. Cell survival was analyzed by MTT, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and clonogenic assay. Western blotting was used for analysis of protein expression, and immunoprecipitation was used to determine interactions of LXR/RXR.
The expression of H2S-generating enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) was inhibited by doxorubicin treatment in HepG2 cells, and H2S sensitized Dox-inhibited cell survival and colony formation. In addition, H2S promoted cellular retention of Dox by suppressing the expressions of ABCA1 and ABCG8. H2S significantly blocked Dox-induced heterodimer formation between LXRα and RXRβ and attenuated the binding of LXRα/RXRβ to the promoters of ABCA1 and ABCG8 genes. RXRβ but not LXRα was S-sulfhydrated by H2S, and blockage of RXRβ S-sulfhydration abolished the inhibitory role of H2S on LXRα/RXRβ heterodimer formation. CSE expression was reduced in Dox-resistant cells in comparison with their parental cells, while H2S could reverse drug resistance in Dox-resistant cells.
Our study provides a novel solution for reversing drug resistance in cancer cells by targeting H2S signalling.
Although GPR35 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, synthetic agonists and antagonists have been developed. Recently, cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer, was reported as an agonist of GPR35 and was shown to exhibit antifibrotic effects through its actions on hepatocytes and stellate cells. In this study, the role of GPR35 in hepatic steatosis was investigated using an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis and an in vivo model of high fat diet-induced liver steatosis. GPR35 was expressed in Hep3B human hepatoma cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. A specific LXR activator, T0901317, induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells. Lodoxamide, the most potent agonist of GPR35, inhibited lipid accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The protective effect of lodoxamide was inhibited by a specific GPR35 antagonist, CID2745687, and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR35. The expression of SREBP-1c, a key transcription factor for lipid synthesis, was induced by T0901317 and the induction was inhibited by lodoxamide. Through the use of specific inhibitors of cellular signaling components, the lodoxamide-induced inhibition of lipid accumulation was found to be mediated through p38 MAPKs and JNK, but not through Gi/o proteins and ERKs. Furthermore, the protective effect of lodoxamide was confirmed in mouse primary hepatocytes. Lodoxamide suppressed high fat diet-induced fatty liver development, which suggested the protective function of GPR35 in liver steatosis. Therefore, the present data suggest that GPR35 may function to protect against fatty liver development.
Macrophages are professional phagocytic cells that play key roles in innate and adaptive immunity, metabolism, and tissue homeostasis. Lipid metabolism is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level, and one of the key players of this regulation in macrophages and other cell types is the LXR subfamily of nuclear receptors (LXRα and LXRβ). The use of LXR double knockout (LXR-DKO) macrophages in vitro has yielded extensive benefits in metabolism research, but this technique is hindered by primary macrophage cell expansion capability, which diminishes along terminal cell differentiation process. Here we detail a method to immortalize LXR double knockout bone marrow-derived macrophage cells at an early stage of differentiation, using a retroviral delivery of a combination of murine v-myc and v-raf oncogenes. This methodology enables the generation of autonomous self-renewing macrophages bearing an LXR-DKO genetic background, as a valuable tool for research in lipid metabolism and other LXR receptor-mediated effects.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors. Class 2 NRs, such as the liver X receptor (LXR)α and (LXR)β, are typically retained in the nucleus bound to the DNA in both the presence and absence of ligand. Upon binding ligands including hydroxylated cholesterol, LXR releases corepressor proteins in exchange for coactivators resulting in target gene transcription. Activity of the LXRs therefore depends on a combination of the local ligand concentration(s) and cofactor expression, which itself is a function of cell and tissue type, mutation load, and epigenetic regulation. Cross talk with other transcription factors or signaling pathways can also alter LXR activity. The role that LXR plays in both normal physiology and disease progression is becoming increasingly apparent, and a better understanding of how and when LXR is activated or repressed is pressing biological and clinical questions.The complexity of LXR regulation makes identifying novel ligands and determining LXR activity in new cell types challenging. Generating cell lines that contain a stably integrated luciferase reporter gene with an upstream LXR-dependent promoter provides a quick, cheap, robust, efficient, and high-throughput solution to identify novel ligands and assess ligand activity in new cell types. Transplant of these stable cell culture cell lines as xenografts allows reporter activation to be assessed in vivo. Here we describe the generation of stable LXR reporter cell lines, how to confirm transgene insertion and select single cell clones, as well a method to assess transgene activity in vitro.
Pancreatic β-cells are sensitive to fluctuations in cholesterol content, which can damage the insulin secretion pathway, contributing to the aetiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoproteins, via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A1 (ABCA1), can prevent intracellular cholesterol accumulation; in some peripheral cells, ABCA1-dependent efflux is enhanced by promotion of cholesterol trafficking to, and generation of Liver X receptor (LXR) ligands by, mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27A1 (cytochrome P450 27 A1/sterol 27-hydroxylase)) and its redox partners, adrenodoxin (ADX) and ADX reductase (ADXR). Despite this, the roles of mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein [StAR] and 18-kDa translocator protein [TSPO]) and metabolising proteins in insulin-secreting cells remain wholly uncharacterised. Here, we demonstrate an increase in pancreatic expression of Cyp27A1, ADXR, TSPO and LXRα, but not ADX or StAR, in obese (fa/fa) rodents compared with lean (Fa/?) controls. Overexpression of Cyp27A1 alone in BRIN-BD11 cells increased INS2 expression, without affecting lipid metabolism; however, after exposure to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoprotein acceptors was enhanced in Cyp27A1-overexpressing cells. Co-transfection of Cyp27A1, ADX and ADXR, at a ratio approximating that in pancreatic tissue, stimulated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in both basal and cholesterol-loaded cells; insulin release was stimulated equally by all acceptors in cholesterol-loaded cells. Thus, genetic obesity increases pancreatic expression of Cyp27A1, ADXR, TSPO and LXRα, while modulation of Cyp27A1 and its redox partners promotes cholesterol efflux from insulin-secreting cells to acceptor (apo)lipoproteins; this response may help guard against loss of insulin secretion caused by accumulation of excess intracellular cholesterol.
Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty acid (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.
Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and arachidonic acid (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.
Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.
Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.
Liver X receptor (LXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays vital roles in maintaining cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Much work has been done on mammalian LXRs, but the role of LXR in fish remains unclear. In the present study, LXR gene was identified from adult Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer, and its predicted protein structure was docked with several cholesterol derivatives at the binding site. The LXR cDNA consisted of 1495 bp encoding a putative LXR protein of 494 amino acids. The Asian seabass LXR retained many important structural features found in LXRs of other fishes and mammals, such as putative signal peptide, activation function-1 (AF-1) domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), activation function-2 (AF-2) domain, and eight conserved cysteine residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of LXR shared significant identity with those of other species ranging from 65.7 to 95.8%. The homology modeling and in silico molecular docking demonstrated that Asian seabass LXR could interact with cholesterol derivatives at amino acid residues Phe274 and Ile312. Real-time PCR further revealed that LXR transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels detected in the gonad followed by the liver. Given the well-known importance of cholesterol-mediated signaling in these tissues, Asian seabass LXR may reasonably be involved in reproduction and lipid metabolism.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerotic disease. It is assessed by intervention or traditional scoring risk factors. Diagnosis is limited by inaccurate and invasive methods. Developing noninvasive methods to screen for the risk of CAD is a major challenge. We aimed to identify urinary proteins associated with CAD. We utilized iTRAQ labeling followed by 2D LC-MS/MS to compare the urinary proteome of CAD patients to healthy cohorts. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to verify the differential proteins. ROC analysis based on MRM data was used to evaluate the diagnostic application. A total of 876 proteins were quantified, and 100 differential proteins were found. Functional analysis revealed that the differential proteins were mainly associated with Liver X Receptor/Retinoid X Receptor (LXR/RXR) pathway activation, atherosclerosis signaling, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, and the top upstream regulator of the differential proteins by IPA analysis indicated to the APOE. Nineteen differential proteins were verified by MRM analysis. ROC based on MRM data revealed that the combination of two proteins (APOD and TFF1) could diagnose CAD with 85% sensitivity and 99% specificity (AUC 0.95). The urinary proteome might reflect the pathophysiological changes in CAD and be used for the clinical study of CAD.
G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is a specific inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Recent studies show that G0S2 plays a critical role in promoting triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in the liver, and its encoding gene is a direct target of a major lipogenic transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR)α. Here we sought to investigate a lipolysis-independent role of G0S2 in hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Knockdown of G0S2 decreased hepatic TG content in mice with ATGL ablation. Conversely, overexpression of G0S2 promoted fatty acid incorporation into TGs and diacylglycerols in both wild-type and ATGL-deficient hepatocytes. Biochemical characterization showed that G0S2 mediates phosphatidic acid synthesis from lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and acyl-coenzyme A. In response to a high-sucrose lipogenic diet, G0S2 is up-regulated via LXRα and required for the increased TG accumulation in liver. Furthermore, deletion of a distinct 4-aa motif necessary for the LPA-specific acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity impaired G0S2's ability to mediate TG synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify G0S2 as a dual-function regulator of lipid metabolism as well as a novel mechanism whereby hepatic TG storage is promoted in response to lipogenic stimulation. In addition to its role as a lipolytic inhibitor, G0S2 is capable of directly promoting TG synthesis by acting as a lipid-synthesizing enzyme.-Zhang, X., Xie, X., Heckmann, B. L., Saarinen, A. M., Gu, H., Zechner, R., Liu, J. Identification of an intrinsic lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity in the lipolytic inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2).
Despite a massive industry endeavor to develop RORy-modulators for autoimmune disorders, there has been no indication of efforts to target the close family member RORα for similar indications. This may be due to the misconception that RORα is redundant to RORy, or the inherent difficulty in cultivating tractable starting points for RORα. RORα-selective modulators would be useful tools to interrogate the biology of this understudied orphan nuclear receptor.
The goal of this research effort was to identify and optimize synthetic ligands for RORα starting from the known LXR agonist T0901317.
Fourty-five analogs of the sulfonamide lead (1) were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to suppress the transcriptional activity of RORα, RORy, and LXRα in cell-based assays. Analogs were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and LC-MS analysis. The pharmacokinetic profile of the most selective RORα inverse agonist was evaluated in rats with intraperitoneal (i.p.) and per oral (p.o.)dosing.
Structure-activity relationship studies led to potent dual RORα/RORy inverse agonists as well as RORα-selective inverse agonists (20, 28). LXR activity could be reduced by removing the sulfonamide nitrogen substituent. Attempts to improve the potency of these selective leads by varying substitution patterns throughout the molecule proved challenging.
The synthetic RORα-selective inverse agonists identified (20, 28) can be utilized as chemical tools to probe the function of RORα in vitro and in vivo.
Niacin, the first antidyslipidemic drug, has been at the center stage of lipid research for many decades before the discovery of statins. However, to date, despite its remarkable effects on lipid profiles, the clinical outcomes of niacin treatment on cardiac events is still debated. In addition to its historically well-defined interactions with central players of lipid metabolism, niacin can be processed by eukaryotic cells to synthesize a crucial cofactor, NAD+ NAD+ acts as a cofactor in key cellular processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and DNA repair. More recently, evidence has emerged that NAD+ also is an essential cosubstrate for the sirtuin family of protein deacylases and thereby has an impact on a wide range of cellular processes, most notably mitochondrial homeostasis, energy homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. NAD+ achieves these remarkable effects through sirtuin-mediated deacetylation of key transcriptional regulators, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α, LXR, and SREBPs, that control these cellular processes. Here, we present an alternative point of view to explain niacin's mechanism of action, with a strong focus on the importance of how this old drug acts as a control switch of NAD+/sirtuin-mediated control of metabolism.
The nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) impacts on cholesterol metabolism as well as hepatic lipogenesis via transcriptional regulation. It is proposed that inhibition of the protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) uncouples these two transcriptional pathways in vivo by acting as a specific lipogenic coactivator of LXR. Here we validated the hypothesis that treatment with the allosteric PRMT3 inhibitor SGC707 will diminish the hepatic steatosis extent, while leaving global cholesterol metabolism, important in cholesterol-driven pathologies like atherosclerosis, untouched. For this purpose, 12-week old hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice were fed a Western-type diet for six weeks to induce both hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. The mice received 3 intraperitoneal injections with SGC707 or solvent control per week. Mice chronically treated with SGC707 developed less severe hepatic steatosis as exemplified by the 51% reduced (P &lt; 0.05) liver triglyceride levels. In contrast, the extent of in vivo macrophage foam cell formation and aortic root atherosclerosis was not affected by SGC707 treatment. Interestingly, SGC707-treated mice gained 94% less body weight (P &lt; 0.05), which was paralleled by changes in white adipose tissue morphology, i.e. reduction in adipocyte size and browning. In conclusion, we have shown that through PRMT3 inhibitor treatment specific functions of LXR involved in respectively the development of fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis can be uncoupled, resulting in an overall diminished hepatic steatosis extent without a negative impact on atherosclerosis susceptibility. As such, our studies highlight that PRMT3 inhibition may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to limit the development of fatty liver disease in humans.
Proteins play an essential role in the biological processes associated with cancer. Their altered expression levels can deregulate critical cellular pathways and interactive networks. In this study, the mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification followed by functional annotation was performed to investigate the most significant deregulated proteins among tissues of primary breast tumor (PT) and axillary metastatic lymph node (LN) and corresponding non-tumor tissues contralateral (NCT) and adjacent (ANT) from patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. A total of 462 proteins was observed as differentially expressed (DEPs) among the groups analyzed. A high level of similarity was observed in the proteome profile of both non-tumor breast tissues and DEPs (n = 12) were mainly predicted in the RNA metabolism. The DEPs among the malignant and non-tumor breast tissues [n = 396 (PTxNCT) and n = 410 (LNxNCT)] were related to pathways of the LXR/RXR, NO, eNOS, eIF2 and sirtuins, tumor-related functions, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Remarkable similarity was observed between both malignant tissues, which the DEPs were related to metastatic capabilities. Altogether, our findings revealed differential proteomic profiles that affected cancer associated and interconnected signaling processes. Validation studies are recommended to demonstrate the potential of individual proteins and/or pathways as biological markers in breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The proteomic analysis of this study revealed high similarity in the proteomic profile of the contralateral and adjacent non-tumor breast tissues. Significant differences were identified among the proteome of the malignant and non-tumor tissue groups of the same patients, providing relevant insights into the hallmarks, signaling pathways, biological functions, and interactive protein networks that act during tumorigenesis and breast cancer progression. These proteins are suggested as targets of relevant interest to be explored as potential biological markers related to tumor development and metastatic progression in the breast cancer disease.
In bovine mammary tissue and cells, liver X receptor (LXR) regulates lipid synthesis mainly via transactivation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). In the present work, we investigated the role of LXR in controlling lipid synthesis via transactivation of SREBP1 in goat primary mammary cells (GMEC). The GMEC were treated with a synthetic agonist of LXR, T0901317, and transactivation and transcription of SREBP1, expression of lipogenic genes, and fatty acid profiling and triacylglycerol (TAG) content of the cells were measured. A mild increase in the mRNA expression level of LXRα (NR1H3) was observed following treatment with different concentrations of T0901317, and a dose-dependent increase in mRNA and transactivation of SREBP1 was detected. Activation of LXR resulted in a significant increase in the mRNA expression of most of the measured genes related to de novo synthesis, desaturation, and transport of fatty acids; TAG synthesis; and transcription regulators. Compared with the control, total content of cellular TAG increased by more than 20% with T0901317 treatment. Furthermore, addition of T0901317 increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:1, C18:1, C20:1, and C22:1), and decreased the proportion of saturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, and C22:0). These results provide evidence that LXR regulates the expression and activity of SREBP1. Our results indicated that LXR participate in regulating the transcription of genes involved in milk fat synthesis in GMEC in an SREBP1-dependent fashion.
Schisandrachinensisbee pollen has been used as a health food in China for centuries; however, its bioactive constituents and functions are not very clear. In this study, we investigated the phenolic compounds of Schisandrachinensisbee pollen extract (SCPE) by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS/HPLC-DAD-ECD and its prevention from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and modulation of gut microbiota in high fat diet induced obese C57BL/6 mice. The results showed that 12 phenolic compounds were identified in SCPE, and naringenin, rutin and chrysin were the main constituents. The content of naringenin reached 1.89 mg/g, and total phenolic content (TPC) of SCPE were 101.83 mg GA/g. After obese mice were administrated with SCPE at 7.86 and 15.72 g/kg BW for 8 weeks, body weight gains were reduced by 18.23% and 19.37%. SCPE could decrease fasting blood glucose, cut down the lipid accumulation in serum and liver, lessen oxidative injury and inflammation in obesity mice. Moreover, SCPE could effectively inhibit the formation of NAFLD by inhibition of LXR-α, SREBP-1c and FAS genes expression, and modulate the structural alteration of gut microbiota in obesity mice. These findings suggested that SCPE could attenuate the features of the metabolism syndrome in obesity mice, which can be used to prevent obesity and NAFLD of human beings.
We have previously demonstrated the pro-tumoral role of neutrophils using a kras-induced zebrafish hepatocarcinogenesis model. To further illustrate the molecular basis of the pro-tumoral role, Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and transcriptomic analyses were carried out by RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed gene profiles of TANs from larvae, male and female livers indicate great variations during liver tumorigenesis, but the common responsive canonical pathways included an immune pathway (Acute Phase Response Signaling), a liver metabolism-related pathway (LXR/RXR Activation) and Thrombin Signaling. Consistent with the pro-tumoral role of TANs, gene module analysis identified a consistent down-regulation of Cytotoxicity module, which may allow continued proliferation of malignant cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated up-regulation of several genes promoting angiogenesis. Consistent with this, we found decreased density of blood vessels accompanied with decreased oncogenic liver sizes in neutrophil-depleted larvae. Collectively, our study has indicated some molecular mechanisms of the pro-tumoral roles of TANs in hepatocarcinogenesis, including weakened immune clearance against tumor cells and enhanced function in angiogenesis.
Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate adaptive immune responses after their migration to secondary lymphoid organs. The LXR ligands/oxysterols and the RXR ligand 9-cis Retinoic Acid (9-cis RA) were shown to dampen DC migration to lymphoid organs through the inhibition of CCR7 expression. We performed transcriptomics of DCs undergoing maturation in the presence of the LXR ligand 22R-Hydroxycholesterol (22R-HC). The analysis highlighted more than 1500 genes modulated by 22R-HC treatment, including the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1, which was found markedly up-regulated. We tested the effect of other nuclear receptor ligands (NRL) and we reported the induction of TREM-1 following RXR, RAR and VDR activation. From a functional point of view, triggering of TREM-1 induced by retinoids increased TNFα and IL-1β release, suggesting an active role of NRL-activated TREM-1+ DCs in inflammation-driven diseases, including cancer. Consistently with this hypothesis we detected DCs expressing TREM-1 in pleural effusions and ascites of cancer patients, an observation validated by the induction of TREM-1, LXR and RAR target genes when monocyte-DCs were activated in the presence of tumor-conditioned fluids. Finally, we observed a better control of LLC tumor growth in Trem-1-/- bone marrow chimera mice as compared to wild type chimera mice. Future studies will be necessary to shed light on the mechanism of TREM-1 induction by distinct NRL, and to characterize the role of TREM-1+ DCs in tumor growth.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) constitutes an autoimmune disease characterized by the breakdown of tolerance to self-antigens, sustained production of pathogenic autoantibodies, and damage to multiple organs and tissues. Nanoparticle (NP)-based therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy in attenuating the progression of SLE. However, investigations of nano-drugs that address the crucial initiating factor in the pathogenesis of SLE; e.g., inefficient clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes and consequent accumulation of self-antigens, have seldom been reported. Here, an apoptotic cell-mimicking gold nanocage (AuNC)-based nano drug carrier capable of correcting the impaired clearance of apoptotic cells in SLE was rationally designed and generated by conjugating phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of liposome-coated AuNCs for liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 delivery. Notably, PS-lipos-AuNC@T0901317 could efficiently enhance apoptotic cell clearance by elevating the expression of Mer, one of the pivotal phagocytosis-associated receptors on macrophages, resulting in decreased production of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, reduced inflammatory response, and alleviation of kidney damage in lupus model mice. Additionally, PS-lipos-AuNC could be tracked by photoacoustic imaging for nano drug carrier biodistribution. By addressing the crucial pathogenic factor of SLE, the NP-based delivery system in this study is envisioned to provide a promising strategy to treat this complex and challenging disease.
Smoking alters pulmonary reverse lipid transport and leads to intracellular lipid accumulation in alveolar macrophages. We investigated whether stimulating reverse lipid transport with an agonist of the liver X receptor (LXR) would help alveolar macrophages limit lipid accumulation and dampen lung inflammation in response to cigarette smoke. Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke and treated intraperitoneally with the LXR agonist T0901317. Expression of lipid capture and lipid export genes was assessed in lung tissue and alveolar macrophages. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Finally, cholesterol efflux capacity and pulmonary surfactant levels were determined. In room air-exposed mice, T0901317 increased the expression of lipid export genes in macrophages and the whole lung and increased cholesterol efflux capacity without inducing inflammation or affecting the pulmonary surfactant. However, cigarette smoke-exposed mice treated with T0901317 showed a marked increase in BAL neutrophils, IL-1α, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor levels. T0901317 treatment in cigarette smoke-exposed mice failed to increase the ability of alveolar macrophages to export cholesterol and markedly exacerbated IL-1α release. Finally, T0901317 led to pulmonary surfactant depletion only in cigarette smoke-exposed mice. This study shows that hyperactivation of LXR and the associated lipid capture/export mechanisms only have minor pulmonary effects on the normal lung. However, in the context of cigarette smoke exposure, where the pulmonary surfactant is constantly oxidized, hyperactivation of LXR has dramatic adverse effects, once again showing the central role of lipid homeostasis in the pulmonary response to cigarette smoke exposure.
Objective- APOA5 variants are strongly associated with hypertriglyceridemia, as well as increased risks of cardiovascular disease and acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia in apo AV dysfunction often aggravates by environmental factors such as high-carbohydrate diets or aging. To date, the molecular mechanisms by which these environmental factors induce hypertriglyceridemia are poorly defined, leaving the high-risk hypertriglyceridemia condition undertreated. Previously, we reported that LXR (liver X receptor)-SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein)-1c pathway regulates large-VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) production induced by LXR agonist. However, the pathophysiological relevance of the finding remains unknown. Approach and Results- Here, we reconstitute the environment-induced hypertriglyceridemia phenotype of human APOA5 deficiency in Apoa5-/- mice and delineate the role of SREBP-1c in vivo by generating Apoa5-/- ;Srebp-1c-/- mice. The Apoa5-/- mice, which showed moderate hypertriglyceridemia on a chow diet, developed severe hypertriglyceridemia on high-carbohydrate feeding or aging as seen in patients with human apo AV deficiency. These responses were nearly completely abolished in the Apoa5-/- ;Srebp-1c-/- mice. Further mechanistic studies revealed that in response to these environmental factors, SREBP-1c was activated to increase triglyceride synthesis and to permit the incorporation of triglyceride into abnormally large-VLDL particles, which require apo AV for efficient clearance. Conclusions- Severe hypertriglyceridemia develops only when genetic factors (apo AV deficiency) and environmental effects (SREBP-1c activation) coexist. We demonstrate that the regulated production of large-sized VLDL particles via SREBP-1c determines plasma triglyceride levels in apo AV deficiency. Our findings explain the long-standing enigma of the late-onset hypertriglyceridemia phenotype of apo AV deficiency and suggest a new approach to treat hypertriglyceridemia by targeting genes that mediate environmental effects.
Although shikimic acid from Illicium verum has antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects, the effect of shikimic acid on lipogenesis has not yet been explored. Thus, in the present study, hypolipogenic mechanism of shikimic acid was examined in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Shikimic acid showed weak cytotoxicity in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells, but suppressed lipid accumulation in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells by Oil Red O staining. Also, shikimic acid attenuated the mRNA expression of de novo lipogenesis related genes such as FAS, SREBP-1c, and LXR-α in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR analysis and suppressed the protein expression of SREBP-1c and LXR-α in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells. It should be noted that shikimic acid activated phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Aacetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and reduced the expression of MID1 Interacting Protein 1 (MID1IP1) in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells. Conversely, depletion of MID1IP1 activated phosphorylation of AMPK, while overexpression of MID1IP1 suppressed phosphorylation of AMPK in HepG2 cells. However, AMPK inhibitor compound c did not affect the expression of MID1IP1, indicating MID1IP1 as an upstream of AMPK. Taken together, our findings suggest that shikimic acid has hypolipogenic effect in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells via phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC and inhibition of MID1IP1 as a potent candidate for prevention or treatment of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia.
Melanogenesis is a physiological process that results in the synthesis of melanin pigments, which play a crucial protective role against skin photocarcinogenesis. We investigated the effects of a Polygoni Multiflori Ramulus extract on melanogenesis and isolated emodin from Polygoni Multiflori as an active compound. In addition, the possible mechanisms of action were examined. We found that emodin inhibited both melanin content and tyrosinase activity concentration and time dependently. Tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 mRNA levels decreased following emodin treatment. However, while the mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were not affected by emodin, emodin reduced MITF protein levels. Furthermore, expression of the liver X-receptor (LXR) α gene, but not the LXR β gene was upregulated by emodin. Moreover, emodin regulated melanogenesis by promoting degradation of the MITF protein by upregulating the LXR α gene. The emodin effects on MITF was found to be mediated by phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by emodin occurs through reduced MITF protein expression, which is mediated by upregulation of the LXR α gene and suggest that emodin may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor. 
Liver X Receptors (LXRs) are sterol-activated transcription factors that play major roles in cellular cholesterol homeostasis, HDL biogenesis and reverse cholesterol transport. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms that control the expression of the human LXRα gene in hepatic cells. A series of reporter plasmids containing consecutive 5' deletions of the hLXRα promoter upstream of the luciferase gene were constructed and the activity of each construct was measured in HepG2 cells. This analysis showed that the activity of the human LXRα promoter was significantly reduced by deleting the -111 to -42 region suggesting the presence of positive regulatory elements in this short proximal fragment. Bioinformatics data including motif search and ChIP-Seq revealed the presence of a potential binding motif for Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 α (HNF-4α) in this area. Overexpression of HNF-4α in HEK 293T cells increased the expression of all LXRα promoter constructs except -42/+384. In line, silencing the expression of endogenous HNF-4α in HepG2 cells was associated with reduced LXRα protein levels and reduced activity of the -111/+384 LXRα promoter but not of the -42/+384 promoter. Using ChiP assays in HepG2 cells combined with DNAP assays we mapped the novel HNF-4α specific binding motif (H4-SBM) in the -50 to -40 region of the human LXRα promoter. A triple mutation in this H4-SBM abolished HNF-4α binding and reduced the activity of the promoter to 65% relative to the wild type. Furthermore, the mutant promoter could not be transactivated by HNF-4α. In conclusion, our data indicate that HNF-4α may have a wider role in cell and plasma cholesterol homeostasis by controlling the expression of LXRα in hepatic cells. 
Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disease triggered by impaired insulin signalling, increased fatty acid uptake and diminished glucose utilisation. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are key transcriptional regulators of metabolic homeostasis. However, their effect in the diabetic heart is largely unknown.
We cloned murine Lxrα (also known as Nr1h3) behind the α-myosin heavy chain (αMhc; also known as Myh6) promoter to create transgenic (Lxrα-Tg) mice and transgene-negative littermates (wild-type [WT]). A mouse model of type 2 diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% energy from fat) over 16 weeks and compared with a low-fat diet (10% energy from fat). A mouse model of type 1 diabetes was induced via streptozotocin injection over 12 weeks.
HFD manifested comparable increases in body weight, plasma triacylglycerol and insulin resistance per OGTT in Lxrα-Tg and WT mice. HFD significantly increased left ventricular weight by 21% in WT hearts, but only by 5% in Lxrα-Tg. To elucidate metabolic effects in the heart, microPET (positron emission tomography) imaging revealed that cardiac glucose uptake was increased by 1.4-fold in WT mice on an HFD, but further augmented by 1.7-fold in Lxrα-Tg hearts, in part through 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and restoration of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). By contrast, streptozotocin-induced ablation of insulin signalling diminished cardiac glucose uptake levels and caused cardiac dysfunction, indicating that insulin may be important in LXRα-mediated glucose uptake. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), as potential direct targets of cardiac LXRα overexpression.
Cardiac-specific LXRα overexpression ameliorates the progression of HFD-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in association with increased glucose reliance and natriuretic peptide signalling during the early phase of diabetic cardiomyopathy. These findings implicate a potential protective role for LXR in targeting metabolic disturbances underlying diabetes.
Soyasaponin Ab (SA) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effect. However, the effects of SA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of SA on LPS-induced ALI and clarify the possible mechanism. The mice were stimulated with LPS to induce ALI. SA was given 1h after LPS treatment. 12h later, lung tissues were collected to assess pathological changes and edema. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to assess inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) production. In vitro, mice alveolar macrophages were used to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SA. Our results showed that SA attenuated LPS-induced lung pathological changes, edema, the expression of cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung tissues, as well as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and NO production in mice. Meanwhile, SA up-regulated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase decreased by LPS in mice. SA also inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β production as well as NF-κB activation in alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, SA could activate Liver X Receptor Alpha (LXRα) and knockdown of LXRα by RNAi abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of SA. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that SA exhibited protective effects against LPS-induced acute lung injury and the possible mechanism was involved in activating LXRα, thereby inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory response. 
Recent studies have shown that activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) attenuates the development of atherosclerosis, not only by regulating lipid metabolism but also by suppressing inflammatory signaling. Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), an important inflammatory gene product, plays a role in the development of various inflammatory diseases. It was proposed that S1PR2 might be regulated by LXR-α. In the present study, the effect of LXR-α on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced S1PR2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated and the underlying mechanism was explored. The results demonstrated that TNF-α led to an increase in S1PR2 expression and triggered a downregulation of LXR-α expression in HUVECs as well. Downregulation of LXR-α with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) remarkably enhanced the primary as well as TNF-α-induced expression of S1PR2 in HUVECs. Activation of LXR-α by agonist GW3965 inhibited both primary and TNF-α-induced S1PR2 expression. GW3965 also attenuated S1PR2-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. The data further showed that TNF-α induced a significant decrease in miR-130a-3p expression. Overexpression of miR-130a-3p with mimic product reduced S1PR2 protein expression, and inhibition of miR-130a-3p by specific inhibitor resulted in an increase in S1PR2 protein expression. Furthermore, activation of LXRs with agonist enhanced the expression of miR-130a-3p, and knockdown of LXR-α by siRNA suppressed miR-130a-3p expression. These results suggest that LXR-α might downregulate S1PR2 expression via miR-130a-3p in quiescent HUVECs. Stimulation of TNF-α attenuates the activity of LXR-α and results in enhanced S1PR2 expression. 
The accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages could induce the formation of foam cells and increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. We wonder if quercetin, one of flavonoids with anti-inflammation functions in different cell types, could elevate the development of foam cells formation in atherosclerosis. We treated foam cells derived from oxLDL induced THP-1 cells with quercetin, and evaluated the foam cells formation, cholesterol content and apoptosis of the cells. We found that quercetin induced the expression of ABCA1 in differentiated THP-1 cells, and increased the cholesterol efflux from THP-1 cell derived foam cells. Eventually, cholesterol level and the formation of foam cell derived from THP-1 cells decreased after quercetin treatment. In addition, quercetin activated PPARγ-LXRα pathway to upregulate ABCA1 expression through increasing protein level of PPARγ and its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of PPARγ activity by siRNA knockdown or the addition of chemical inhibitor, GW9662, abolished quercetin induced ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux in THP-1 derived macrophages. Our data demonstrated that quercetin increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages through upregulating the expressions of PPARγ and ABCA1. Taken together, increasing uptake of quercetin or quercetin-rich foods would be an effective way to lower the risk of atherosclerosis. 
A promising treatment for obesity involves the use of therapeutic agents that increase the level of the glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) which reduces appetite and food intake. Native GLP-1 is rapidly metabolized by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme and, as such, GLP-1 mimetics or DPP-4 inhibitors represent promising treatment approaches. Interestingly, obese patient receiving such medications showed improved lipid profiles and cholesterol homeostasis, however the mechanism(s) involved are not known. Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABCA1 and ABCG1, play essential roles in reverse cholesterol transport and in high density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. These transporters are under the transcriptional regulation of liver X receptor alpha (LXR-α). We hypothesize that GLP-1 mimetics and/or DPP-4 inhibitors modulate ABCA1/ABCG1 expression in adipocytes through an LXR-α mediated process and thus affecting cholesterol homeostasis. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (2 nM) or the GLP-1 mimetic exendin-4 (5 nM). Gene and protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and LXR-α were determined and correlated with cholesterol efflux. Expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin and the glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) were also determined. Treatment with both medications significantly increased the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXR-α and GLUT-4, decreased IL-6 and leptin, and improved cholesterol efflux from adipocytes (P &lt; 0.05). Our data suggest that GLP-1-based therapy modulate ABCA1/ABCG1 expression in adipocytes potentially through an LXR-α mediated process. 
Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1; gene name SREBF1) is known to be the master regulator of lipid homeostasis in mammals, including milk fat synthesis. The major role of SREBP1 in controlling milk fat synthesis has been demonstrated in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Except for a demonstrated role in controlling the expression of FASN, a regulatory role of SREBP1 on milk fat synthesis is very likely, but has not yet been demonstrated in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). To explore the regulatory function of SREBP1 on de novo fatty acids and triacylglycerol synthesis in GMEC, we overexpressed the mature form of SREBP1 (active NH2-terminal fragment) in GMEC using a recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad-nSREBP1), with Ad-GFP (recombinant adenovirus of green fluorescent protein) as control, and infected the GMEC for 48 h. In infected cells, we assessed the expression of 20 genes related to milk fat synthesis using real time-quantitative PCR, the protein abundance of SREBP1 and FASN by Western blot, the production of triacylglycerol, and the fatty acid profile. Expression of SREBF1 was modest in mammary compared with the other tissues in dairy goats but its expression increased approximately 30-fold from pregnancy to lactation. The overexpression of the mature form of SREBP1 was confirmed by &gt;200-fold higher expression of SREBF1 in Ad-nSREBP1 compared with Ad-GFP. We observed no changes in amount of the precursor form of SREBP1 protein but a &gt;10-fold increase of the mature form of SREBP1 protein with Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with Ad-GFP cells (control), Ad-nSREBP1 cells had a significant increase in expression of genes related to long-chain fatty acid activation (ACSL1), transport (FABP3), desaturation (SCD1), de novo synthesis of fatty acids (ACSS2, ACLY, IDH1, ACACA, FASN, and ELOVL6), and transcriptional factors (NR1H3 and PPARG). We observed a &gt;10-fold increase in expression of INSIG1 but SCAP was downregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Among genes related to milk fat synthesis and lipid droplet formation, only LPIN1 and DGAT1 were upregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with the Ad-GFP, the cellular triacylglycerol content was higher and the percentage of C16:0 and C18:1 increased, whereas that of C16:1, C18:0, and C18:2 decreased in Ad-nSREBP1 cells. Overall, the data provide strong support for a central role of SREBP1 in the regulation of milk fat synthesis in goat mammary cells. 
Nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) has a vital role in cholesterol homeostasis and is reported to have a role in adipose function and obesity although this is controversial. Conversely, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are suggested to be a major source of adipocyte generation. Accordingly, we examined the role of LXRα in adipogenesis of MSCs. Adult murine MSCs (mMSCs) were isolated from wild-type (WT) and LXR-null mice. Using WT mMSCs, we further generated cell lines stably overexpressing GFP-LXRα (mMSC/LXRα/GFP) or GFP alone (mMSC/GFP) by retroviral infection. Confluent mMSCs were differentiated into adipocytes by the established protocol. Compared with MSCs isolated from WT mice, MSCs from LXR-null mice showed significantly increased adipogenesis, as determined by lipid droplet accumulation and adipogenesis-related gene expression. Moreover, mMSCs stably overexpressing GFP-LXRα (mMSC/LXRα/GFP) exhibited significantly decreased adipogenesis compared with mMSCs overexpressing GFP alone (mMSC/GFP). Since Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is reported to inhibit adipogenesis, we further examined it. The LXR-null group showed significantly decreased Wnt expression accompanied by a decrease of cellular beta-catenin (vs WT). The mMSC/LXRα/GFP group exhibited significantly increased Wnt expression accompanied by an increase of cellular beta-catenin (vs mMSC/GFP). These data demonstrate that LXRα has an inhibitory effect on adipogenic differentiation in mMSCs with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. These results provide important insights into the pathophysiology of obesity and obesity-related consequences such as metabolic syndrome and may identify potential therapeutic targets. 
Betaine has been proven effective in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in animal models, however, its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aims of this study were to explore the mechanisms mediating the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic actions of betaine in fructose-fed rats. In this study, betaine improved insulin resistance, reduced body weight gain and serum lipid levels, and prevented hepatic lipid accumulation in fructose-fed rats. It up-regulated hepatic expression of liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), with the attenuation of the changes of their target genes, including hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1α, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1, apolipoprotein B, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and adipocyte differentiation-related protein, involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipid storage in these model rats. Furthermore, betaine alleviated ER stress and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, CPT II, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and fatty acid synthase expression involved in fatty acid synthesis in the liver of fructose-fed rats. Betaine suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis in fructose-fed rats by moderating protein kinase B -forkhead box protein O1 pathway, as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Moreover, betaine inhibited hepatic nuclear factor kappa B /nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 inflammasome activation-mediated inflammation in this animal model. These results demonstrated that betaine ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation, gluconeogenesis, and inflammation through restoring LXRα and PPARα expression and alleviating ER stress in fructose-fed rats. This study provides the potential mechanisms of betaine involved in the treatment of NAFLD. 
Increasing evidence shows that diabetes causes cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, liraglutide, would attenuate cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. Twenty-four Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 2 groups fed either a normal diet (normal, n = 6) or a high-fat diet (HFD, n = 18) for 4 weeks. Then, the HFD rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to create a diabetic rat model. Diabetic rats were divided into 3 subgroups receiving vehicle (diabetic, n = 6), a low dose of liraglutide (Llirag, 0.2 mg/kg/day, n = 6) or a high dose of liraglutide (Hlirag, 0.4 mg/kg/day, n = 6). Metabolic parameters, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular (LV) function, and whole genome expression of the heart were determined. Diabetic rats developed insulin resistance, increased blood lipid levels and oxidative stress, and impaired LV function, serum adiponectin, NO. Liraglutide improved insulin resistance, serum adiponectin, NO, heart rate and LV function and reduced blood triglyceride, total cholesterol levels and oxidative stress. Moreover, liraglutide increased heart Nr1h3 , Ppar-α and Srebp expression and reduced Dgat , and Angptl3 expression. Liraglutide prevented in cardiac dysfunction by activating the PPARα pathway to inhibit Dgat expression and oxidative stress in diabetic rats.
(1) To investigate the expression patterns of MΦ1 and MΦ2 phenotype markers of peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived macrophages in atherosclerosis patients and healthy controls, as well as the expression correlation among these genes. (2) To elucidate whether a high level of liver X receptor α (LXRα) expression is associated with anti-inflammatory MΦ2-type polarization.
Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were obtained from 28 patients with carotid artery plaques and 10 normal persons, who did not have carotid artery plaques. M1 and M2 phenotype markers were analyzed after cellular differentiation into macrophages. Human macrophages derived from healthy donors were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding LXRα and control null-plasmids. Gene expression levels were quantified after further differentiation.
Three genes (LXRα, CD68, and CD36) were expressed at a significantly lower rate in the atherosclerotic group than normal patients. There were correlations between the expression of LXRα, CD68, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ), and between CD163, CD36 and scavenger receptor class A (SRA1). Macrophages over-expressing LXRα exhibited enhanced expression level of MΦ2-type genes and decreased expression level of MΦ1-type genes.
PBMCs from healthy persons were predisposed to the MΦ2 differentiation phenotype, which exhibits elevated cholesterol uptake and anti-inflammatory properties. LXRα over-expression polarizes macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory MΦ2 phenotype.
Adipogenesis is a complex biological process involving synchronised interplay of different nuclear receptors. Aberration in the process leads to obesity and associated disorders. Addressing the complexity of molecular mechanisms, we worked on characterising the changes in NR1C3/PPARγ-, NR1H3/LXRα- and NCoAs/SRCs-associated microRNA, genes and proteins during different time points of adipogenesis. Glucose uptake of differentiating cells was checked at selected time points with FACS. Observations on gene expression pattern pointed a correlation in adipogenic-related genes and increased expression of PPARγ, but not LXRα. Western blot experiments also supported the gene expression pattern. MicroRNAs that vary during adipogenesis was selected using bioinformatics tools and database. Real-time PCR-based experiments showed a change in the expression of mmu-mir-23a-3p, 206-3p, 17-3p, 126a-3p and 1a-3p. Mmu-mir-23a-3p showed a gradual decrease in expression corresponding to the progression of adipogenesis. MicroRNA 23a-3p and 1a-3p showed positive association to the mRNA levels of NCoA1 and 3. Overall, the study elaborates time-dependent variations in nucleic acid and protein expression during adipogenesis in accordance to fatty acid and glucose metabolism.
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological malignancy. Obesity is a major risk factor for EC and is associated with elevated cholesterol. 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is a cholesterol metabolite that functions as an endogenous agonist for Liver X receptor (LXR) and a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Exposure to oestrogenic ligands increases risk of developing EC; however, the impact of 27HC on EC is unknown. Samples of stage 1 EC (n = 126) were collected from postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy. Expression of LXRs (NR1H3, LXRα; NR1H2, LXRβ) and enzymes required for the synthesis (CYP27A1) or breakdown (CYP7B1) of 27HC were detected in all grades of EC. Cell lines originating from well-, moderate- and poorly-differentiated ECs (Ishikawa, RL95, MFE 280 respectively) were used to assess the impact of 27HC or the LXR agonist GW3965 on proliferation or expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of LXR- or ER-dependent promoters (LXRE, ERE). Incubation with 27HC or GW3965 increased transcription via LXRE in Ishikawa, RL95 and MFE 280 cells (P &lt; 0.01). 27HC selectively activated ER-dependent transcription (P &lt; 0.001) in Ishikawa cells and promoted proliferation of both Ishikawa and RL95 cells (P &lt; 0.001). In MFE 280 cells, 27HC did not alter proliferation but selective targeting of LXR with GW3965 significantly reduced cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.0001). These novel results suggest that 27HC can contribute to risk of EC by promoting proliferation of endometrial cancer epithelial cells and highlight LXR as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of advanced disease.
oxLDL is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions through cholesterol accumulation in macrophage foam cells. Andrographolide, the bioactive component of Andrographis paniculata, possesses several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anticancer functions. Scavenger receptors (SRs), including class A SR (SR-A) and CD36, are responsible for the internalization of oxLDL. In contrast, receptors for reverse cholesterol transport, including ABCA1 and ABCG1, mediate the efflux of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells. Transcription factor liver X receptor [Formula: see text] (LXR[Formula: see text] plays a key role in lipid metabolism and inflammation as well as in the regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. Because of the contribution of inflammation to macrophage foam cell formation and the potent anti-inflammatory activity of andrographolide, we hypothesized that andrographolide might inhibit oxLDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation. The results showed that andrographolide reduced oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophage foam cells. Andrographolide decreased the mRNA and protein expression of CD36 by inducing the degradation of CD36 mRNA; however, andrographolide had no effect on SR-A expression. In contrast, andrographolide increased the mRNA and protein expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, which were dependent on LXR[Formula: see text]. Andrographolide enhanced LXR[Formula: see text] nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. Treatment with the LXR[Formula: see text] antagonist GGPP and transfection with LXR[Formula: see text] siRNA reversed the ability of andrographolide to stimulate ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein expression. In conclusion, inhibition of CD36-mediated oxLDL uptake and induction of ABCA1- and ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux are two working mechanisms by which andrographolide inhibits macrophage foam cell formation, which suggests that andrographolide could be a potential candidate to prevent atherosclerosis.
Lipid metabolism disorders (dyslipidemia) are causes of male infertility, but little is known about their impact on male gametes when considering post-testicular maturation events, given that studies concentrate most often on endocrine dysfunctions and testicular consequences. In this study, three-month-old wild-type (wt) and Liver-X-Receptors knock out (Lxrα;β

It may lead to the identification of fertility prognostic markers in this pathophysiological situation, which could help clinicians to better understand male infertilities which are thus far classified as idiopathic.
Exposure to metabolic stress has been suggested to influence the susceptibility to metabolic disorders in offspring according to epidemiological and animal studies. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated impacts of diet-induced paternal obesity on metabolic phenotypes in offspring and its underlying molecular mechanism.
Male founder mice (F0), fed with control diet (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD), were mated with CD-fed females. F1 progenies were mated with outbred mice to generate F2 mice. All offspring were maintained on CD. Metabolic phenotypes, metabolism-related gene expression and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers were measured in serum or relevant tissues of F2 mice. DNA methylation in sperm and testis of the founder and in the liver of F2 mice was investigated.
Male founder obesity, instigated by HFD, led to glucose dysregulation transmitted down to F2. We found that F2 males to HFD founders were overweight and had a high fasting glucose relative to F2 to CD founders. F2 females to HFD founders, in contrast, had a reduced bodyweight relative to F2 to CD founders and exhibited an early onset of impaired glucose homeostasis. The sex-specific difference was associated with distinct transcriptional patterns in metabolism-related organs, showing altered hepatic glycolysis and decreased adipose Glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) in males and increased gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis in females. Furthermore, the changes in females were linked to hepatic ER stress, leading to suppressed insulin signaling and non-obese hyperglycemic phenotypes. DNA methylation analysis revealed that the Nr1h3 locus was sensitive to HFD at founder germ cells and the alteration was also detected in the liver of F2 female.
Our findings demonstrate that male founder obesity influences impaired glucose regulation in F2 progeny possibly via ER stress in a sex-specific manner and it is, in part, contributed by altered DNA methylation at the Nr1h3 locus.
Macrophages play pivotal roles in the progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory M2 state is a key characteristic of atherosclerotic plaques undergoing regression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this potential association of the M2 polarization with atherosclerosis regression remain poorly understood. Further, human genetic factors that facilitate these anti-atherogenic processes remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription factor MafB plays pivotal roles in promoting macrophage M2 polarization. Further, MafB promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells by directly up-regulating its key cellular mediators. Notably, MafB expression is significantly up-regulated in response to various metabolic and immunological stimuli that promote macrophage M2 polarization or cholesterol efflux, and thereby MafB mediates their beneficial effects, in both liver x receptor (LXR)-dependent and independent manners. In contrast, MafB is strongly down-regulated upon elevated pro-inflammatory signaling or by pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic microRNAs, miR-155 and miR-33. Using an integrative systems biology approach, we also revealed that M2 polarization and cholesterol efflux do not necessarily represent inter-dependent events, but MafB is broadly involved in both the processes. These findings highlight physiological protective roles that MafB may play against atherosclerosis progression.
Inflammatory factors regulated by NF-κB play a significant role in PAH and myocardial hypertrophy. LXR activation may inhibit myocardial hypertrophy via suppressing inflammatory pathways; it is unknown whether LXR is also involved in PAH-induced myocardial hypertrophy or remodeling. To further explore the protective effect of LXR in PAH-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, a PAH model was developed, and T0901317, an agonist of LXR, was used to examine the effect of LXR activation. PAH rats demonstrated obvious cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in the right ventricle, but significant improvement of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling was observed in PAH rats treated with T0901317. Through RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA examination, NF-κB, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS were found to be significantly reduced in PAH rats treated with T0901317 compared to PAH rats treated with DMSO. Apoptosis was also significantly reduced in PAH rats treated with T0901317. Thus, LXR activation may inhibit PAH-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways.
With emerging evidence connecting cholesterol dysregulation with disturbed pulmonary homeostasis, we are wondering if diet induced hypercholesterolemia would influence the susceptibility to chemical induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. Six to eight week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a high-cholesterol atherogenic diet (HCD) or matching normal diet (ND), respectively. Following 3 weeks diet adapting, a multi-dose intraperitoneal injections of ethyl carbamate (urethane, 1 g/kg body weight) were established and lung tumorigenesis assessments were taken after 15 weeks latency period. Compared to the urethane treated ND-fed mice, the HCD-fed mice exhibited significantly decreased lung tumor multiplicity and attenuated pulmonary inflammation, which including reduced influx of leukocytes and down regulated tumor-promoting cyto-/chemokine profile in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, decreased TLR2/4 expression and NF-κB activation in the lung. As a sensor regulating intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, nuclear receptor LXR-α was up-regulated significantly in the urethane treated HCD-fed mice lungs compared to the ND-fed mice lungs, accompanied with decreased pulmonary free cholesterol content and suppressed tumor cell proliferation. These results suggested that intrapulmonary cholesterol homeostasis, other than systematic cholesterol level, is important in lung tumorigenesis, and LXR activation might partly contribute to the inhibitory role of atherogenic diet on lung tumorigenesis.
Liver X receptors (LXRα/β) and carbohydrate response element-binding proteins (ChREBPα/β) are key players in the transcriptional control of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. LXRα/β double knockout (LXRα-/-/β-/-) mice have reduced feeding-induced nuclear O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling, ChREBPα activity, and lipogenic gene expression in livers, suggesting important roles for LXRs in linking hepatic glucose utilization to lipid synthesis. However, the role of LXRs in fructose-induced ChREBP activation and lipogenesis is currently unknown. In this study, we studied the effects of high fructose or high glucose feeding on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenic gene expression in livers from fasted (24 h) and fasted-refed (12 h) wild type and LXRα knockout (LXRα-/-) mice. Hepatic lipogenic gene expression was reduced in glucose fed, but not fructose fed LXRα-/- mice. This was associated with lower expression of liver pyruvate-kinase (L-pk) and Chrebpβ, indicating reduced ChREBPα activity in glucose fed, but not fructose fed mice. Interestingly, ChREBP binding to the L-pk promoter was increased in fructose fed LXRα-/- mice, concomitant with increased glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) expression and O-GlcNAc modified LXRβ, suggesting a role for LXRβ in regulating ChREBPα activity upon fructose feeding. In conclusion, we propose that LXRα is an important regulator of hepatic lipogenesis and ChREBPα activity upon glucose, but not fructose feeding in mice.
The iodothyronine deiodinases are selenoenzymes that regulate the activity of thyroid hormone via specific inner- or outer-ring deiodination. In humans, type 1 deiodinase (D1) is highly expressed in the liver, but the mechanism by which its gene expression is regulated remains to be elucidated. Liver X receptor α (LXRα), a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed in the liver, where it functions as a sensor for excess intracellular oxysterols. LXRα interacts with other nuclear receptors on promoters of genes that contain a binding core sequence for nuclear receptors. In addition, it is reported that the promoter of the gene encoding human D1 (hDIO1) contains the core sequence for one of nuclear receptors, thyroid hormone receptor (TR). We investigated the involvement of LXRα in the regulation of hDIO1, in the liver. We performed hDIO1 promoter-reporter assays using a synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317, and compared promoter activity between a human liver carcinoma cell line, HepG2, and a clone of human embryonic kidney cells, TSA201. We defined the region between nucleotides -131 and -114, especially nucleotides -126 and -125, of the hDIO1 promoter as critical for basal and LXRα-mediated specific transcriptional activation in HepG2 cells. An increase in hDIO1 expression was observed in LXRα-stimulated cells, but absent in cycloheximide-treated cells, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for LXRα-mediated regulation of hDIO1. On the other hand, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that LXRα and RXRα bound to the hDIO1 promoter. We also demonstrated that LXRα and TRβ compete with each other on this specific region of the promoter. In conclusion, our results indicated that LXRα plays a specific and important role in activation of TH by regulating D1, and that LXRα binds to and regulates the hDIO1 promoter, competing with TRβ on specific sequences within the promoter.
Oxidative stress activates macroautophagy/autophagy and contributes to atherogenesis via lipophagic flux, a form of lipid removal by autophagy. However, it is not known exactly how endogenous antioxidant enzymes are involved in lipophagic flux. Here, we demonstrate that the antioxidant PRDX1 (peroxiredoxin 1) has a crucial role in the maintenance of lipophagic flux in macrophages. PRDX1 is more highly expressed than other antioxidant enzymes in monocytes and macrophages. We determined that Prdx1 deficiency induced excessive oxidative stress and impaired maintenance of autophagic flux in macrophages. Prdx1-deficient macrophages had higher intracellular cholesterol mass and lower cholesterol efflux compared with wild type. This perturbation in cholesterol homeostasis was due to impaired lipophagic cholesterol hydrolysis caused by excessive oxidative stress, resulting in the inhibition of free cholesterol formation and the reduction of NR1H3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3) activity. Notably, impairment of both lipophagic flux and cholesterol efflux was restored by the 2-Cys PRDX-mimics ebselen and gliotoxin. Consistent with this observation, apoe -/- mice transplanted with bone marrow from prdx1-/-apoe-/- mice had increased plaque formation compared with apoe-/- BM-transplanted recipients. This study reveals that PRDX1 is crucial to regulating lipophagic flux and maintaining macrophage cholesterol homeostasis against oxidative stress. We suggest that PRDX1-dependent control of oxidative stress may provide a strategy for treating atherosclerosis and autophagy-related human diseases.
Diabesity and fatty liver have been associated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thus could impair macrophage-specific reverse cholesterol transport (m-RCT). Liver X receptor (LXR) plays a critical role in m-RCT. Abcg5/g8 sterol transporters, which are involved in cholesterol trafficking into bile, as well as other LXR targets, could be compromised in the livers of obese individuals. We aimed to determine m-RCT dynamics in a mouse model of diabesity, the db/db mice. These obese mice displayed a significant retention of macrophage-derived cholesterol in the liver and reduced fecal cholesterol elimination compared with nonobese mice. This was associated with a significant downregulation of the hepatic LXR targets, including Abcg5/g8. Pharmacologic induction of LXR promoted the delivery of total tracer output into feces in db/db mice, partly due to increased liver and small intestine Abcg5/Abcg8 gene expression. Notably, a favorable upregulation of the hepatic levels of ABCG5/G8 and NR1H3 was also observed postoperatively in morbidly obese patients, suggesting a similar LXR impairment in these patients. In conclusion, our data show that downregulation of the LXR axis impairs cholesterol transfer from macrophages to feces in db/db mice, whereas the induction of the LXR axis partly restores impaired m-RCT by elevating the liver and small intestine expressions of Abcg5/g8.
Post-prandial hyperlipidemia has emerged as a cardiovascular risk factor with limited therapeutic options. The Liver X receptors (Lxrs) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate cholesterol elimination. Knowledge of their role in regulating the absorption and handling of dietary fats is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of intestinal Lxrα in post-prandial intestinal lipid transport. Using Lxrα knockout (nr1h3-/-) and intestine-limited Lxrα over-expressing [Tg(fabp2a:EGFP-nr1h3)] zebrafish strains, we measured post-prandial lipid excursion with live imaging in larvae and physiological methods in adults. We also conducted a long-term high-cholesterol dietary challenge in adults to examine the chronic effect of modulating nr1h3 gene dose on the development of hypercholesterolemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. Over-expression of Lxrα in the intestine delays the transport of ingested lipids in larvae, while deletion of Lxrα increases the rate of lipid transport. Pre-treating wildtype larvae with the liver-sparing Lxr agonist hyodeoxycholic acid also delayed the rate of intestinal lipid transport in larvae. In adult males, deletion of Lxrα accelerates intestinal transport of ingested lipids. Adult females showed higher plasma Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) activity compared to males, and lower post-gavage blood triacylglycerol (TAG) excursion. Despite the sexually dimorphic effect on acute intestinal lipid handling, Tg(fabp2a:EGFP-nr1h3) adults of both sexes are protected from high cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, while nr1h3-/- mutants are sensitive to the effects of HCD challenge. These data indicate that intestinal Lxr activity dampens the pace of intestinal lipid transport cell-autonomously. Selective activation of intestinal Lxrα holds therapeutic promise.
Liver X receptor (LXR) activation exerts an anti-tumor effect. However, whether the tumor LXR expression has prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient has not been addressed yet. Primary HCC and the adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from 169 patients who underwent routine curative surgical treatment. All patients were followed for prognosis analyses. Tumor LXR was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. In in vitro study, several HCC cell lines were cultured for cellular protein detection of LXR and other cytokines, including nuclear factor kappa (NFκB), Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and -9). Meanwhile, the invasion ability of cultured HCC cell lines was performed. We found that LXR expression status in tumor samples is associated with the clinical characteristics, such as tumor stage and metastasis, of HCC patients. Prognosis analysis shows that tumor LXR expression status is closely related to the post-operative outcome in HCC patients who underwent surgical treatment. Patients with low LXR expression have a significantly lower mean 5-year overall survival rate and mean overall survival period than those with high LXR level. Our in vitro data reveal that HCC cell lines had increased NF-κB, MMP2, MMP9 and invasive ability than normal cell line, which are suppressed by LXR activation via NFκB pathway. Our data suggest that LXR could be used as a biomarker for HCC prognosis. Further study is warranted to explore the molecular mechanism under which LXR regulates tumor behaves.
Allicin, a major component of garlic, is regarded as a cardioprotective agent and is associated with increased endothelial function.
The effects of allicin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the mechanisms underlying these effects were studied. The protective effects were measured using cell viability, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and cell apoptosis as indicators, and the anti-oxidative activity was determined by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, oxidative products and endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. HUVEC mitochondrial function was assessed by determining mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, cytochrome c production and mitochondrial ATP release. To investigate the potential underlying mechanisms, we also measured the expression of dynamic mitochondrial proteins using western blotting. Furthermore, we evaluated the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Our results demonstrated that allicin enhanced HUVEC proliferation, which was suppressed by LPS exposure, and LDH release. Allicin ameliorated LPS-induced apoptosis, suppressed ROS overproduction, reduced lipid peroxidation and decreased the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities in HUVECs. These protective effects were associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by decreases in the MMP collapse, cytochrome c synthesis and mitochondrial ATP release. In addition, allicin attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory responses, including endothelial cell adhesion and TNF-α and IL-8 production. Furthermore, allicin increased the expression of LXRα in a dose-dependent manner. Allicin-induced attenuation of inflammation was inhibited by LXRα siRNA treatment. Finally, allicin activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which controls the defense against oxidative stress and inflammation.
Taken together, the present data suggest that allicin attenuated the LPS-induced vascular injury process, which may be closely related to the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in HUVECs. Allicin modulated Nrf2 activation and protected the cells against LPS-induced vascular injury. Our findings suggest that allicin attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response in blood vessels.
Allicin is considered anti-atherosclerotic due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which makes it an important drug for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. However, the effects of allicin on foam cells are unclear. Thus, in this study, we examined the effects of allicin on lipid accumulation via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)/liver X receptor α (LXRα) in THP‑1 macrophage-derived foam cells. THP‑1 cells were exposed to 100 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 24 h, and then to oxydized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL; 50 mg/ml) to induce foam cell formation. The results of Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed showed that pre-treatment of the foam cells with allicin decreased total cholesterol, free cholesterol (FC) and cholesterol ester levels in cells, and also decreased lipid accumulation. Moreover, allicin upregulated ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and promoted cholesterol efflux. However, these effects were significantly abolished by transfection with siRNA targeting ABCA1. Furthermore, PPARγ/LXRα signaling was activated by allicin treatment. The allicin-induced upregulation of ABCA1 expression was also abolished by PPARγ inhibitor (GW9662) and siRNA or LXRα siRNA co-treatment. Overall, our data demonstrate that the allicin-induced upregulation of ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux and reduces lipid accumulation via PPARγ/LXRα signaling in THP‑1 macrophage-derived foam cells.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a class of transcription factors that regulate many cellular functions through manipulation of gene expression and also play important roles in tumorigenesis, proliferation, progression and prognosis in various kinds of cancers according to recent studies. This work aimed to determine the predictive ability of NRs in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
A total of 308 MIBC patients with complete clinicopathological and RNASeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were collected for filtration. Genes showed clear correlations with overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were further validated in 123 MIBC patients recruited consecutively from 2008 to 2012 in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan-Meier plot were used to assess the relative factors.
In TCGA cohort, we found that high NR1H3 (HR=0.779, 95% CI: 0.634 - 0.957), NR2C1 (HR=0.673, 95% CI: 0.458 - 0.989) and NR2F6 (HR=0.750, 95% CI: 0.574 - 0.980) expressions were independent factors of favorable OS, while only low NR1H3 (log-rank test, P=0.0076) and NR2F6 (log-rank test, P=0.0395) expressions had the ability to predict poor prognosis for RFS. Further, in FUSCC validating cohort, we confirmed that low NR1H3 expression level was independent factor of poor OS (HR=1.295, 95% CI: 1.064 - 1.576) and it had the ability to predict poor RFS (log-rank test, P=0.0059).
Low NR1H3 expression level is an independent prognostic factor of poor OS, and can also predict worse RFS in MIBC patients. Our "TCGA filtrating and local database validating" model can help reveal more prognostic biomarkers and cast a new light in understanding certain gene function in MIBC.
To investigate whether activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) inhibits amyloid β1-40 (Aβ1-40) induced inflammatory and senescent responses in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.
Confluent cultures of human primary RPE and ARPE-19 cells pretreated with 5 μΜ of TO901317 (TO90), a synthetic agonist of LXR, or vehicle were incubated with 1 μΜ of Aβ1-40 or Aβ40-1. The optimum concentrations of Aβ1-40 and TO90 were determined by cell viability assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression and localization of an aging protein p16INK4a (p16) were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Expressions of LXRs and one of their target genes ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) were examined by real-time PCR and western blotting. Phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-κB-α (p-IκB-α) was assessed by western blotting.
A negative linear relationship between the Aβ1-40 concentration and the cell viability was evident, indicating Aβ1-40 decreased ARPE-19 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Aβ1-40 enhanced the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 as well as p16 in both RPE cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas TO90 counteracted the detrimental effects. TO90 upregulated the expression of LXRα and its target gene ABCA1, but it did not affect the expression of LXRβ. Meanwhile, TO90 inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α mediated by Aβ1-40 stimulation.
Activation of the LXRα-ABCA1 axis may alleviate Aβ1-40 induced inflammatory and senescent responses in RPE cells. The beneficial effect appears associated with the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Peri-conceptional exposure to maternal obesogenic nutrition is associated with in utero programming of later-life overweight and metabolic disease in the offspring. We aimed to investigate whether dietary intervention with a modified fatty acid quality in an obesogenic high-calorie (HC) diet during the preconception and gestational phases can improve unfavourable effects of an adipogenic maternal environment. In NMRI mice, peri-conceptional and gestational obesity was induced by feeding a HC diet (controls), and they were compared with dams on a fat-modified (Fat-mod) HC diet of the same energy content but enriched with medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and adjusted to a decreased ratio of n-6 to n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). Effects on maternal and placental outcomes at delivery (day 17.5 post coitum) were investigated. Despite comparable energy assimilation between the two groups of dams, the altered fatty acid composition of the Fat-mod HC diet induced lower maternal body weight, weights of fat depots, adipocyte size, and hepatic fat accumulation compared to the unmodified HC diet group. Further, there was a trend towards lower fasting glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations in dams fed the Fat-mod HC diet. Phenotypic changes were accompanied by inhibition of transcript and protein expression of genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis comprising PPARG2 and its target genes Fasn, Acaca, and Fabp4, whereas regulation of other lipogenic factors (Srebf1, Nr1h3, Abca1) appeared to be more complex. The modified diet led to a sex-specific placental response by upregulating PPARG-dependent fatty acid transport gene expression in female versus male placentae. Qualitative modification of the fatty acid spectrum of a high-energy maternal diet, using a combination of both MCFAs and n-3 LC-PUFAs, seems to be a promising interventional approach to ameliorate the adipogenic milieu of mice before and during gestation.
16-Dehydropregnenolone (DHP) has been developed and patented as a promising antihyperlipidemic agent by CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), India. Although DHP is implicated in controlling cholesterol homeostasis, the mechanism underlying its pharmacological effect in hyperlipidemic disease models is poorly understood. In the present study, we postulated that DHP lowers serum lipids through regulating the key hepatic genes accountable for cholesterol metabolism. The hypothesis was tested on golden Syrian hamsters fed with high-fat diet (HFD) following oral administration of DHP at a dose of 72mg/kg body weight for a period of one week. The serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total bile acids (TBA) in feces were measured. Real time comparative gene expression studies were performed for CYP7A1, LXRα and PPARα level in liver tissue of hamsters. The results revealed that the DHP profoundly decreased the levels of serum TC, TG, LDL-C and atherogenic index (AI), whilst elevated the HDL-C/TC ratio. Besides, DHP exhibited an anti-hyperlipidemic effect in the HFD induced hyperlipidemic hamsters by means of: (1) up-regulating the gene expression of CYP7A1 encoded cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, that promotes the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid; (2) inducing the gene expression of transcription factors LXRα and PPARα; (3) increasing the TBA excretion through feces. Collectively, the findings presented confer the hypolipidemic activity of DHP via up-regulation of hepatic CYP7A1 pathway that promotes cholesterol-to-bile acid conversion and bile acid excretion.
Aging is associated with increased levels of circulating inflammatory markers and reduced muscle mass and strength.
We investigated whether intake of protein-enriched milk for 12 weeks would influence markers of inflammation among adults ≥70years of age with reduced physical strength.
In a double-blind randomized controlled intervention study, subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving a protein-enriched milk (2×20g protein/d, n=14, mean (±SD) age 76.9±4.9 yrs) or an isocaloric carbohydrate drink (n=17, age 77.7±4.8 yrs) for 12 weeks. We measured serum and mRNA expression levels of inflammatory markers in PBMCs.
Significant differences in the mRNA expression of nuclear receptor subfamily, group H, member 3 (NR1H3, encoding the LXRα transcription factor) and interferon gamma (INFG) were observed between groups. The mRNA level of TNFRSF1A was significantly reduced, while the mRNA level of dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) was significantly increased, in the control group. The serum level of TNFα increased significantly in the control group, while sTNFRSF1A increased significantly in both groups, but with no significant differences between groups.
Consumption of a low-fat, protein-enriched milk for 12 weeks had minor effects on inflammatory related markers in older adults compared to an isocaloric carbohydrate drink.
The adipokine adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) has been implicated in obesity-related cardio-metabolic complications. Here we show that A-FABP increases thermogenesis by promoting the conversion of T4 to T3 in brown adipocytes. We find that A-FABP levels are increased in both white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues and the bloodstream in response to thermogenic stimuli. A-FABP knockout mice have reduced thermogenesis and whole-body energy expenditure after cold stress or after feeding a high-fat diet, which can be reversed by infusion of recombinant A-FABP. Mechanistically, A-FABP induces the expression of type-II iodothyronine deiodinase in BAT via inhibition of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor α, thereby leading to the conversion of thyroid hormone from its inactive form T4 to active T3. The thermogenic responses to T4 are abrogated in A-FABP KO mice, but enhanced by A-FABP. Thus, A-FABP acts as a physiological stimulator of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis.
Maternal undernutrition programs fetal energy homeostasis and increases the risk of metabolic disorders later in life. This study aimed to identify the signs of hepatic metabolic programming in utero and during the juvenile phase after intrauterine undernutrition during midgestation.
Fifty-three pregnant goats were assigned to the control (100% of the maintenance requirement) or restricted (60% of the maintenance requirement from day 45 to day 100 of midgestation and realimentation thereafter) group to compare hepatic energy metabolism in the fetuses (day 100 of gestation) and kids (postnatal day 90).
Undernutrition increased the glucagon concentration and hepatic hexokinase activity, decreased the body weight, liver weight and hepatic expression of G6PC, G6PD, and PGC1α mRNAs, and tended to decrease the hepatic glycogen content and ACOX1 mRNA level in the dams. Maternal undernutrition decreased the growth hormone (GH) and triglyceride concentrations, tended to decrease the body weight and hepatic hexokinase activity, increased the hepatic PCK1, PCK2 and PRKAA2 mRNAs levels and glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and tended to increase the hepatic PRKAB1 and CPT1α mRNAs levels in the male fetuses. In the restricted female fetuses, the hepatic hexokinase activity and G6PC mRNA level tended to be increased, but PKB1 mRNA expression was decreased and the ACACA, CPT1α, NR1H3 and STK11 mRNA levels tended to be decreased. Maternal undernutrition changed the hepatic metabolic profile and affected the metabolic pathway involved in amino acid, glycerophospholipid, bile acid, purine, and saccharide metabolism in the fetuses, but not the kids. Additionally, maternal undernutrition increased the concentrations of GH and cortisol, elevated the hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and tended to decrease the hepatic glycogen content in the male kids. No alterations in these variables were observed in the female kids.
Maternal undernutrition affects the metabolic status in a sex- and stage-specific manner by changing the metabolic profile, expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis and enzyme activities in the liver of the fetuses. The changes in the hormone levels in the male fetuses and kids, but not the female offspring, represent a potential sign of metabolic programming.
Total flavones of Epimedium (TFE) is the main active ingredient in Herba Epimedii, which is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine that is widely used to treat certain age-related diseases in oriental countries.
The aim of this work was to investigate the anti-aging properties of TFE related to lipid metabolism.
Both transcriptomics and metabonomics were applied in this work to investigate the anti-aging properties of TFE. Microarray and LC-MS analysis were conducted on liver samples of three groups of rats, including young (4 months), old (24 months), and old rats administrated TFE.
Transcriptomics analysis highlighted 287 transcripts related to the anti-aging effect of TFE, in which the expression ratio of 18 genes regulating lipid metabolism, including HMGCS1 and NR1H3, returned to normal levels after TFE treatment. In addition, 24 aging-related metabolites were discovered in a metabonomics study, and 15 of these were structurally identified, including palmitic amide, linoleamide, and oleamide. Bioinformatics and integral data analysis on the results of the transcriptomics and metabonomics suggest the involvement of 12 key metabolic pathways, half of which are highly related to lipid metabolism.
This study demonstrates that the role played by TFE in the lipid metabolism of aging rats is multifaceted and multi-layered.
Abruptio placentae is a complex multifactorial disease that is associated with maternal and neonatal death and morbidity. Abruptio placentae's high recurrence rate, high prevalence of heritable thrombophilia among women with abruptio placentae, and aggregation of cases in families of women with the disease support the possibility of a genetic predisposition. Previous genome-wide and candidate gene association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation genes that potentially are associated with abruptio placentae risk. Perturbations in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, which results in mitochondrial dysfunction, can lead to the impairment of differentiation and invasion of the trophoblast and to several obstetrics complications that include abruptio placentae.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the results of a candidate genetic association study that indicated a link between DNA variants (implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation) and abruptio placentae could be replicated.
The study was conducted among participants (507 abruptio placentae cases and 1090 control subjects) of the Placental Abruption Genetic Epidemiology study. Weighted genetic risk scores were calculated with the use of abruptio placentae risk-increasing alleles of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation genes (CAMK2B, NR1H3, PPARG, PRKCA, THRB, COX5A, NDUFA10, NDUFA12, and NDUFC2), which previously was reported in the Peruvian Abruptio Placentae Epidemiology study, a study with similar design and study population to the Placental Abruption Genetic Epidemiology study. Logistic regression models were fit to examine associations of weighted genetic risk scores (quartile 1, &lt;25th percentile; quartile 2, 25-50th percentile; quartile 3, 50-70th percentile, and quartile 4, &gt;75th percentile) with risk of abruptio placentae, adjusted for population admixture (the first 4 principal components), maternal age, infant sex, and preeclampsia. The weighted genetic risk score was also modeled as a continuous predictor. To assess potential effect modification, analyses were repeated among strata that were defined by preeclampsia status, maternal age (≥35 vs 18-34 years), and infant sex.
Abruptio placentae cases were more likely to have preeclampsia, shorter gestational age, and lower infant birthweight. Participants in quartile 2 (score, 12.6-13.8), quartile 3 (score, 13.9-15.0) and quartile 4 (score, ≥15.1) had a genetic risk score of 1.45-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.02; P=.03), a 1.42-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.98; P=.04), and a 1.75-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.42; P=7.0E-04) higher odds of abruptio placentae, respectively, compared with those in quartile 1 (score,&lt;12.6; P-for trend=.0003). The risk of abruptio placentae was 1.12-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.19; P=3.0×1004) higher per 1-unit increase in the score. Among women with preeclampsia, those in quartile 4 had a 3.92-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.48-10.36; P=.01) higher odds of abruptio placentae compared with women in quartile 1. Among normotensive women, women in quartile 4 had a 1.57-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.21; P=.01) higher odds of abruptio placentae compared with those in quartile 1 (P-for interaction=.12). We did not observe differences in associations among strata defined by maternal age or infant sex.
In this study, we replicated previous findings and provide strong evidence for DNA variants that encode for genes that are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, which confers risk for abruptio placentae. These results shed light on the mechanisms that implicate DNA variants that encode for proteins in mitochondrial function that are responsible for abruptio placentae risk. Therapeutic efforts to reduce risk of abruptio placentae can be enhanced by improved biologic understanding of maternal mitochondrial biogenesis/oxidative phosphorylation pathways and identification of women who would be at high risk for abruptio placentae.
A recent study analyzed 2053 multiple sclerosis (MS) cases and 799 healthy controls to investigate whether five genetic variants (rs11039149, rs12221497, rs2279238, rs7120118 and rs7114704) in NR1H3 are associated with MS risk. However this study reported negative results. It is very important that the appropriate samples and approach should be used in replication studies, which may provide the correct interpretation of the results. Here, we evaluated the above findings using large-scale MS genome-wide association studies with a total of 27,148 samples including 9772 MS cases and 17,376 controls, and multiple expression quantitative trait loci datasets. The results suggest that rs7120118 and rs2279238 variants are significantly associated with MS risk, and could significantly regulate NR1H3 expression in kinds of human tissues and cells. In summary, these findings provide important supplementary information about the association between NR1H3 variants and MS risk.
Preventing postpartum uterine disease depends on the ability of endometrial cells to tolerate the presence of the bacteria that invade the uterus after parturition. Postpartum uterine disease and endometrial pathology in cattle are most associated with the pathogen Trueperella pyogenes. Trueperella pyogenes secretes a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, pyolysin, which causes cytolysis by forming pores in the plasma membrane of endometrial stromal cells. The aim of the present study was to identify cell-intrinsic pathways that increase bovine endometrial stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin. Pyolysin caused dose-dependent cytolysis of bovine endometrial stromal cells and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into supernatants. Cell tolerance to pyolysin was increased by inhibitors that target the mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis pathway, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase, cell cycle, or metabolic pathways. Cellular cholesterol was reduced and cell tolerance to pyolysin was increased by supplying the mevalonate-derived isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate, or by inhibiting farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 or geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 to increase the abundance of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Supplying the mevalonate-derived isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate also increased cell tolerance to pyolysin, but independent of changes in cellular cholesterol. However, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate inhibits nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H receptors (NR1H, also known as liver X receptors), and reducing the expression of the genes encoding NR1H3 or NR1H2 increased stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin. In conclusion, mevalonate-derived isoprenoids increased bovine endometrial stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin, which was associated with reducing cellular cholesterol and inhibiting NR1H receptors.
High-sugar intake and senescence share common deleterious effects, in particular in liver, but combination of these two factors was little studied. Our aims were to examine the effect of a high-sucrose diet in liver of old rats and also the potential benefices of a polyphenol/micronutrient supplementation. Four groups of 22-month-old male rats fed during 5 months with a diet containing either 13 or 62% sucrose, supplemented or not with rutin, vitamin E, A, D, selenium, and zinc were compared. We measured liver macronutrient composition, glycation/oxidative stress, enzyme activities (lipogenesis, β-oxidation, fructokinase), gene expression (enzymes and transcription factors), in vivo protein synthesis rates and plasma parameters. Sucrose induced an increase in plasma and liver lipid content, and a stimulation of liver protein synthesis rates. Gene expression was little changed by sucrose, with lower levels for LXR-α and LXR-β. Polyphenol/micronutrient supplementation tended to limit liver triglyceride infiltration through variations in fatty acid synthase, acyl coA oxidase, and possibly ATP-citrate lyase activities. In conclusion, despite differences in enzymatic regulations, and blunted responses of gene expression, high-sucrose diet was still able to induce a marked increase in liver lipid content in old animals. However, it probably attenuated the positive impact of polyphenol/micronutrients.
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Recently established of biobank repositories have resulted in large amounts of data, enabling the identification of the remaining heritability for complex traits. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study of IOP to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We identified 671 directly genotyped variants that are significantly associated with IOP (P &lt; 5 × 10-8). In addition to 103 novel loci, the top ranked novel IOP genes are LMX1B, NR1H3, MADD and SEPT9. We replicated these findings in an external population and examined the pleiotropic nature of these loci. These discoveries not only further our understanding of the genetic architecture of IOP, but also shed new light on the biological processes underlying glaucoma.
Because the cost of cereals is unstable and represents a large part of production charges for meat-type chicken, there is an urge to formulate alternative diets from more cost-effective feedstuff. We have recently shown that meat-type chicken source is prone to adapt to dietary starch substitution with fat and fiber. The aim of this study was to better understand the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to changes in dietary energy sources through the fine characterization of transcriptomic changes occurring in three major metabolic tissues - liver, adipose tissue and muscle - as well as in circulating blood cells.
We revealed the fine-tuned regulation of many hepatic genes encoding key enzymes driving glycogenesis and de novo fatty acid synthesis pathways and of some genes participating in oxidation. Among the genes expressed upon consumption of a high-fat, high-fiber diet, we highlighted CPT1A, which encodes a key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, the repression of lipogenic genes by the high-fat diet was clearly associated with the down-regulation of SREBF1 transcripts but was not associated with the transcript regulation of MLXIPL and NR1H3, which are both transcription factors. This result suggests a pivotal role for SREBF1 in lipogenesis regulation in response to a decrease in dietary starch and an increase in dietary PUFA. Other prospective regulators of de novo hepatic lipogenesis were suggested, such as PPARD, JUN, TADA2A and KAT2B, the last two genes belonging to the lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) complex family regulating histone and non-histone protein acetylation. Hepatic glycogenic genes were also down-regulated in chickens fed a high-fat, high-fiber diet compared to those in chickens fed a starch-based diet. No significant dietary-associated variations in gene expression profiles was observed in the other studied tissues, suggesting that the liver mainly contributed to the adaptation of birds to changes in energy source and nutrients in their diets, at least at the transcriptional level. Moreover, we showed that PUFA deposition observed in the different tissues may not rely on transcriptional changes.
We showed the major role of the liver, at the gene expression level, in the adaptive response of chicken to dietary starch substitution with fat and fiber.
As the most abundant flavonoid in Ampelopsis grossedentata, the protective effects of dihydromyricetin on atherosclerosis have been well established, yet the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dihydromyricetin on lipid accumulation and the underlying molecular mechanisms in macrophages and ApoE-/- mice. Incubation with dihydromyricetin significantly attenuated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-mediated cholesterol and lipid accumulation in THP-1-derived macrophages, which was due to increased cholesterol efflux. In addition, dihydromyricetin increased mRNA and protein expressions of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 but had no effect on the mRNA and protein expressions of SR-A, CD36, or SR-BI involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Furthermore, the upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 by dihydromyricetin depended on liver X receptor α (LXRα), as evidenced by an increase in the nuclear level of LXRα and its prevention of the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 after inhibition of LXRα activity by knockdown of LXRα expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA). Accordingly, dihydromyricetin-mediated suppression of cholesterol and lipid accumulation in macrophages was also abrogated by LXRα siRNA. Moreover, the lesion size of atherosclerosis was smaller in dihydromyricetin-treated ApoE-/- mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice, and the protein expression of CD36, SR-A, ABCA1, ABCG1 and LXRα in aortas was modulated similar to that observed in THP-1-derived macrophages. These data suggest that promotion of LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux is crucial event in suppression of lipid accumulation by dihydromyricetin in the transformation of macrophage foam cells.
Liver X receptor beta (LXRbeta) is a ligand dependent transcription factor that is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. LXRbeta and its isoform LXRalpha have recently been recognized as important regulators of lipid homeostasis in vertebrates. N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged rat LXRbeta was expressed in Escherichia coli as a full-length protein and purified in two chromatographic steps, immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration. From 10g of bacterial cells, 2.5mg of protein was recovered. The purified LXRbeta is functional with respect to ligand-, DNA-, and coactivator-binding. The synthetic ligand T0901317 bound to LXRbeta with high affinity yielding a K(d) of 2.7nM. Specific interaction with DR4 response elements, in the presence of RXR, was demonstrated with electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance analysis of LXRbeta binding to coactivator peptides revealed a ligand dependent interaction with the C-terminal nuclear receptor binding site of the coactivator RAP250. The purified LXRbeta constitutes an important tool for further functional and structural studies.
The transcription of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) is greatly decreased in cholesterol-fed rabbits. To determine whether the molecular structure of the promoter is responsible for this downregulation, we cloned the rabbit CYP7A1 promoter, identified the binding sites for alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and liver X receptor (LXRalpha), and studied the effects of FTF, LXRalpha, and SHP on its transcription. Adding LXRalpha/retinoid X receptor together with their ligands (L/R) to the promoter/reporter construct transfected into HepG2 cells greatly increased its activity. FTF did not increase promoter activity, nor did it enhance the stimulatory effect of L/R. Mutating the FTF binding site abolished the promoter baseline activity. Increasing amounts of SHP abolished the effect of L/R, and FTF enhanced the ability of SHP to decrease promoter activity below baseline levels. Thus, downregulation of CYP7A1 in cholesterol-fed rabbits is attributable secondarily to the activation of farnesoid X receptor, which increases SHP expression to override the positive effects of LXRalpha. Although FTF is a competent factor for maintaining baseline activity, it does not further enhance and may suppress CYP7A1 transcription.
Trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been identified as an intermediate of rumen fatty acid biohydrogenation that caused milk fat depression (MFD) in the dairy cow. Previous studies in cows experiencing CLA- and diet-induced MFD have identified reduced mammary expression of the master lipogenic regulator sterol response element transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) and many of its dependent genes. To distinguish between primary mechanisms regulating milk fat synthesis and secondary adaptations to the reduction in milk fat, we conducted a time-course experiment. Eleven dairy cows received by abomasal infusion an initial priming dose of 6.25 g of CLA followed by 12.5 g/d delivered in multiple pulses per day for 5 d. Cows were milked 3×/d and mammary biopsies were obtained under basal condition (prebolus control) and 12, 30, and 120 h relative to initiation of CLA infusion. Milk fat concentration and yield decreased progressively reaching a nadir at 69 h (1.82% and 38.2 g/h) and averaged 2.03 ± 0.19% and 42.1 ± 4.10 g/h on the last day of treatment (±standard deviation). Expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were decreased at 30 and 120 h compared with control. Expression of SREBF1 and THRSP were also decreased at 30 and 120 h compared with control. Additionally, we failed to observe changes in other factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and liver × receptor β and milk fat globular membrane proteins, during CLA treatment. However, expression of milk fat globular membrane proteins were decreased after 14 d of diet-induced MFD in samples from a previous experiment, indicating a possible long-term response. The rapid decrease in lipogenic enzymes, SREBF1, and THRSP provide strong support for their transcriptional regulation as a primary mechanism of milk fat depression.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Notably, they are also expressed by T cells and are involved in regulating T cell proliferation and differentiation. In this issue of the JCI, Cui et al. have elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of LXR activation on a subset of T cells known as Th17 cells in mice and humans. Specifically, they showed that LXR-induced Srebp-1 inhibits Il17 transcription by binding to the Il17 promoter through interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), a transcription factor known to enhance Th17 cell responses.
Adaptations in the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle cells can occur under several physiological or pathological conditions. We investigated the effect of increasing extracellular glucose concentration on the expression of markers of energy metabolism in primary skeletal muscle cells and the C2C12 muscle cell line. Growth of myotubes in 25mM glucose (high glucose, HG) compared with 5.55mM led to increases in the expression and activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a marker of glycolytic energy metabolism, while oxidative markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and citrate synthase decreased. HG induced metabolic adaptations as are seen during a slow-to-fast fiber transformation. Furthermore, HG increased fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) IId/x but did not change slow MHCI/β expression. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was shown to mediate the effects of HG on GAPDH and MHCIId/x. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a glucose-dependent transcription factor downstream of PP2A, partially mediated the effects of glucose on metabolic markers. The glucose-induced increase in PP2A activity was associated with an increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, which presumably mediates the increase in MHCIId/x promoter activity. Liver X receptor, another possible mediator of glucose effects, induced only an incomplete metabolic shift, mainly increasing the expression of the glycolytic marker. Taken together, HG induces a partial slow-to-fast transformation comprising metabolic enzymes together with an increased expression of MHCIId/x. This work demonstrates a functional role for ChREBP in determining the metabolic type of muscle fibers and highlights the importance of glucose as a signaling molecule in muscle.
Hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver are common in patients with type 2 diabetes, but the factors connecting alterations in glucose metabolism with plasma and liver lipid metabolism remain unclear. Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), a regulator of hepatic and plasma triglyceride metabolism, is elevated in type 2 diabetes. In this study, we analyzed whether apoCIII is affected by altered glucose metabolism.
Liver-specific insulin receptor-deficient mice display lower hepatic apoCIII mRNA levels than controls, suggesting that factors other than insulin regulate apoCIII in vivo. Glucose induces apoCIII transcription in primary rat hepatocytes and immortalized human hepatocytes via a mechanism involving the transcription factors carbohydrate response element-binding protein and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α. ApoCIII induction by glucose is blunted by treatment with agonists of farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α but not liver X receptor, ie, nuclear receptors controlling triglyceride metabolism. Moreover, in obese humans, plasma apoCIII protein correlates more closely with plasma fasting glucose and glucose excursion after oral glucose load than with insulin.
Glucose induces apoCIII transcription, which may represent a mechanism linking hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes.
There exists a general recognition of the fact that LXR-α, being a member of the nuclear receptor family, plays a crucial role in the biological process that connects inflammation, cholesterol homeostasis, and cellular decisions. In this context the present study was addressed to understand the role of LXR-α gene in the selective and specific reprogramming of cancer cells into a state of apoptosis leaving the normal cells unaffected. The results of this study revealed that LXR-α gene when activated in cancerous cells of diverse origin results in the regulation of genes coding for Bcl-2, AATF, and Par-4 in a fashion, forcing these cells to enter into the state of apoptosis leaving the normal cells unaffected. On the basis of this study we propose that in near future LXR-α agonist (Withaferin A) may definitely find its use in the therapeutic interventions directed towards the treatment of cancer.
The liver X receptors (LXR) α and β regulate lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis and inflammation. Lxrβ⁻/⁻ mice are glucose intolerant and at the same time lean. We aimed to assess the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LXRβ and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and related traits in 3 separate cohort studies.
Twenty LXRβ SNPs were identified by sequencing and genotyped in the HUNT2 adult nested case-control study for T2DM (n = 835 cases/1986 controls). Five tag-SNPs (rs17373080, rs2695121, rs56151148, rs2303044 and rs3219281), covering 99.3% of the entire common genetic variability of the LXRβ gene were identified and genotyped in the French MONICA adult study (n = 2318) and the European adolescent HELENA cross-sectional study (n = 1144). In silico and in vitro functionality studies were performed.
We identified suggestive or significant associations between rs17373080 and the risk of (i) T2DM in HUNT2 (OR = 0.82, p = 0.03), (ii) obesity in MONICA (OR = 1.26, p = 0.05) and (iii) overweight/obesity in HELENA (OR = 1.59, p = 0.002). An intron 4 SNP (rs28514894, a perfect proxy for rs17373080) could potentially create binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1). The C allele of rs28514894 was associated with ~1.25-fold higher human LXRβ basal promoter activity in vitro. However, no differences between alleles in terms of DNA binding and reporter gene transactivation by HNF4α or NF1 were observed.
Our results suggest that rs17373080 in LXRβ is associated with T2DM and obesity, maybe via altered LXRβ expression.
NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is one of the most frequent chronic liver diseases worldwide. The metabolic factors associated with NAFLD are also determinants of liver disease progression in chronic HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection. It has been reported that, besides inducing hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis, LXR (liver X receptor) regulates a set of inflammatory genes. We aimed to evaluate the hepatic expression of LXRα and its lipogenic and inflammatory targets in 43 patients with NAFLD, 44 with chronic HCV infection and in 22 with histologically normal liver. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to determine hepatic expression levels of LXRα and related lipogenic and inflammatory mediators in the study population. We found that the LXRα gene and its lipogenic targets PPAR-γ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ), SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1c, SREBP-2 and FAS (fatty acid synthase) were overexpressed in the liver of NAFLD and HCV patients who had steatosis. Moreover, up-regulation of inflammatory genes, such as TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-α, IL (interleukin)-6, OPN (osteopontin), iNOS (inducible NO synthase), COX (cyclo-oxygenase)-2 and SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signalling)-3, was observed in NAFLD and HCV patients. Interestingly, TNF-α, IL-6 and osteopontin gene expression was lower in patients with steatohepatitis than in those with steatosis. In conclusion, hepatic expression of LXRα and its related lipogenic and inflammatory genes is abnormally increased in NAFLD and HCV patients with steatosis, suggesting a potential role of LXRα in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in these chronic liver diseases.
Liver X receptor α (LXRα) is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates lipid metabolism. Recently, it has been shown that activation of LXRα with synthetic ligands has anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis and chemical-induced dermatitis. We investigated the effect of the LXRα agonist, T0901317, on lung inflammation in a rodent model of hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in male rats by withdrawing blood to a goal mean arterial blood pressure of 50 mmHg. Blood pressure was maintained at this level for 3 h, at which point rats were rapidly resuscitated with shed blood. Animals were then treated with T0901317 (50 mg · kg) or vehicle i.p. and sacrificed at 1, 2, and 3 h after resuscitation. Treatment with T0901317 significantly improved the cardiac and stroke volume indices as well as the heart rate of rats during the resuscitation period as compared with vehicle-treated rats. The T0901317-treated animals showed significant improvement in the plasma level of lactate, whereas base deficit and bicarbonate levels both trended toward improvement. The T0901317-treated animals also showed lower levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, TNF-α, KC, and IL-6. Lung injury and neutrophil infiltration were reduced by treatment with T0901317, as evaluated by histology and myeloperoxidase assay. At molecular analysis, treatment with T0901317 increased nuclear LXRα expression and DNA binding while also inhibiting activation of nuclear factor κB, a proinflammatory transcription factor, in the lung. Thus, our data suggest that LXRα is an important modulator of the inflammatory response and lung injury after severe hemorrhagic shock, likely through the inhibition of the nuclear factor κB pathway.
Twelve patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were referred to a comprehensive orthopaedic rehabilitation center after failure of conservative management. Ten underwent amputation of the affected limb and, although functional improvement occurred in the patients undergoing lower limb amputation, psychosocial dysfunction persisted. All the patients required psychological support. In cases of post-Sudeck amputation, early orthopaedic diagnosis and referral to a comprehensive treatment center are recommended. In the 12 cases described here, apart from the obvious limb pathology, severe psychological inadequacies were found to be present.
Recent reports suggest that oestrogen receptors detected in the cytosolic fraction of homogenized human breast tumours might be mainly nuclear receptor released into the cytoplasm during tissue processing. This study thus compares the tumour content of steroid hormone receptors in conventional cytosolic receptor assays with direct measurements of receptor in the cell nucleus. Unoccupied cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors (cER), cytoplasmic progesterone receptors (cPR) and total (occupied plus unoccupied) nuclear oestrogen receptors (nER) have been measured in parallel in human breast tumour tissue using biochemical radioreceptor assay. Of 125 tumours, 62% and 61% were positive for cER and cPR, respectively, 50% contained nER with high affinity for oestradiol (nER I) and 13% expressed nER with low affinity for oestradiol (nER II). The concentration of cER correlated significantly with age, cPR and log nER I. A significant proportion of tumours which were positive for both cytosol receptors also possessed nuclear receptors with high and low affinity for oestrogen. It is possible that this group of tumours which are positive for cER, cPR, nER I and nER II will respond well to hormone therapy.
NER, a new member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor (NR)-encoding gene family, was isolated from a human osteosarcoma SAOS/B10 cell line cDNA library. NER codes for a polypeptide of 461 amino acids which contains the conserved sequences of the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of typical steroid hormone NR. It has highest homology with the retinoic acid receptors: 55% at the DNA-binding domain and 38-40% at the ligand-binding domain. A single transcript of 2.3 kb was detected in all cells and tissues tested. Although no ligand was identified for NER-I, its wide distribution may indicate that this novel steroid hormone NR may play a basic role in cell function.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes many different types of DNA lesions. Most NER proteins are indispensable for repair. In contrast, the yeast Rad23 represents a class of accessory NER proteins, without which NER activity is reduced but not eliminated. In mammals, the complex of HR23B (Rad23 homolog) and XPC (yeast Rad4 homolog) has been suggested to function in the damage recognition step of NER. However, the precise function of Rad23 or HR23B in NER remains unknown. Recently, it was suggested that the primary function of RAD23 protein in NER is its stabilization of XPC protein. Here, we tested the significance of Rad23-mediated Rad4 stabilization in NER, and analyzed the repair and biochemical activities of purified yeast Rad23 protein. Cellular Rad4 was indeed stabilized by Rad23 in the absence of DNA damage. Persistent overexpression of Rad4 in rad23 mutant cells, however, largely failed to complement the ultraviolet sensitivity of the mutant. Consistently, deficient NER in rad23 mutant cell extracts could not be complemented by purified Rad4 protein in vitro. In contrast, partial complementation was observed with purified Rad23 protein. Specific complementation to the level of wild-type repair was achieved by adding purified Rad23 together with small amounts of Rad4 protein to rad23 mutant cell extracts. Purified Rad23 protein was unable to bind to DNA, but stimulated the binding activity of purified Rad4 protein to N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-damaged DNA. These results support two roles of Rad23 protein in NER: (i) its direct participation in the repair biochemistry, possibly due to its stimulatory activity on Rad4-mediated damage binding/recognition; and (ii) its stabilization of cellular Rad4 protein.
Accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has been postulated to reflect defects in Aβ degradation or clearance. Here, we selected 12 genes (MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9) involved in Aβ catabolism on the basis of PubMed-based literature search and elucidated their genetic role in AD among Finnish case-control cohort consisting of total ∼1,300 AD patients and control subjects. Thirty one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping. In a smaller subset of AD patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ42 (n = 124), total-tau (n = 59), and phospho-tau (n = 54) analyses were performed with respect to SNPs. Moreover, age of onset analyses with respect to the studied SNPs were conducted among the AD patient cohort (n = 642). Association analysis of the liver X receptor α (NR1H3) gene SNPs showed a protective effect for C allele carriers of rs7120118 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.93), while the total-tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF were decreased in AD patients carrying the C allele. Also, a decrease in the age of onset was observed in AD patients carrying the A allele of rs723744 and the C allele of rs3794884 in transthyretin (TTR) gene. However, after adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons, these results were not statistically significant, suggesting that genetic variations in MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9 genes do not play major role among the Finnish AD patient cohort.
To investigate the contribution of polymorphisms in nuclear receptors to risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Genotypes of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (NFKB1) NFκB -94ins/del (rs28362491); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ (PPARγ) PPARγ Pro12Ala (rs 1801282) and C1431T (rs 3856806); pregnane X receptor (PXR) (NR1I2) PXR A-24381C (rs1523127), C8055T (2276707), and A7635G (rs 6785049); and liver X receptor (LXR) (NR1H2) LXR T-rs1405655-C and T-rs2695121-C were assessed in a Danish case-control study of 327 Crohn's disease patients, 495 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 779 healthy controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were estimated by logistic regression models.
The PXR A7635G variant, the PPARγ Pro12Ala and LXR T-rs2695121-C homozygous variant genotypes were associated with risk of UC (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03-1.66, P = 0.03, OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.04-5.08, P = 0.04, and OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.00-1.98, P = 0.05, respectively) compared to the corresponding homozygous wild-type genotypes. Among never smokers, PXR A7635G and the LXR T-rs1405655-C and T-rs2695121-C variant genotypes were associated with risk of IBD (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.91, P = 0.02, OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.21-2.20, P = 0.001, and OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.36-2.99, P = 0.0005, respectively) compared to the respective homozygous variant genotypes. PXR A7635G (rs6785049) variant genotype was associated with a higher risk of UC diagnosis before the age of 40 years and with a higher risk of extensive disease (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.75 and OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.24-5.03, respectively).
Common PXR and LXR polymorphisms may contribute to risk of IBD, especially among never smokers.
The liver X receptors (LXRs)-α and -β play a crucial role in control of insulin production and secretion in pancreatic β-cells. We hypothesized that common variants in the NR1H2 and NR1H3 genes, encoding LXR-β and -α, respectively, may alter pancreatic β-cell function. One thousand five hundred seventy-four subjects of European ancestry with elevated risk for type 2 diabetes were genotyped for the two NR1H2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2248949 and rs1405655 and for the four NR1H3 SNPs rs11039149, rs3758673, rs12221497 and rs2279238, and association studies with metabolic traits were performed. Metabolic characterization comprised an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in all participants and, in addition, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in subsets. One hundred per cent of common genetic variation (minor allele frequency ≥1%) within the NR1H2 and NR1H3 loci (D' = 1.0; r² ≥ 0.8) were covered by the six chosen tagging SNPs. NR1H2 rs2248949 was nominally associated with OGTT-derived first-phase insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion to insulin and significantly associated with the AUC of insulin levels during the IVGTT (p = 0.007) after adjustment for age, gender, BMI and insulin sensitivity in the dominant model, with the minor allele conferring reduced pancreatic β-cell function to the carriers. In subjects of European ancestry at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, common variation within the NR1H2 gene impaired insulin secretion, which may facilitate the development of type 2 diabetes.
The oxysterol nuclear receptors, LXRα (liver X receptor α; NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), coordinately regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, and cholesterol transport. Previous studies have demonstrated that ligands of LXRα are important in the maintenance of the normal epidermal barrier function and keratinocyte differentiation. In this study, we examined whether LXRα and its ligands regulate lipid synthesis in HaCaT cells, a spontaneously transformed human keratinocyte cell line. When HaCaT cells were treated with the LXRα ligand TO901317, lipid droplets accumulated in the majority of cells, which were stained by Oil Red O. A luciferase reporter construct containing the LXR response element was activated about fourfold in HaCaT cells by TO901317 treatment, suggesting that LXR has a role in lipid synthesis in these cells. The expression of LXRα target genes, such as those encoding sterol regulatory binding protein and fatty acid synthase, were induced time dependently by TO901317, as measured by RT-PCR and western blotting. The expression of PPAR-α, -β, and -γ which regulate lipid metabolism, was also increased by TO901317 treatment. In contrast, TO901317 reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in HaCaT cells. These results indicate that LXRα activation leads to lipogenesis in keratinocytes, which may enhance the epidermal barrier function of the skin.
The ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, are LXR-target genes that play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport. We examined the effects of inhibitors of the cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe) and synthesis (statins) on expression of these transporters in HepG2 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of individuals with primary (and nonfamilial) hypercholesterolemia (HC).
A total of 48 HC individuals were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/day/4 weeks) and 23 were treated with ezetimibe (10 mg/day/4 weeks), followed by simvastatin (10 mg/day/8 weeks) and simvastatin plus ezetimibe (10 mg of each/day/4 weeks). Gene expression was examined in statin- or ezetimibe-treated and control HepG2 cells as well as PBMCs using real-time PCR.
In PBMCs, statins and ezetimibe downregulated ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression but did not modulate NR1H2 (LXR-β) and NR1H3 (LXR-α) levels. Positive correlations of ABCA1 with ABCG1 and of NR1H2 with NR1H3 expressions were found in all phases of the treatments. In HepG2 cells, ABCA1 mRNA levels remained unaltered while ABCG1 expression was increased by statin (1.0-10.0 µM) or ezetimibe (5.0 µM) treatments. Atorvastatin upregulated NR1H2 and NR1H3 only at 10.0 µM, meanwhile ezetimibe (1.0-5.0 µM) downregulated NR1H2 but did not change NR1H3 expression.
Our findings reveal that lipid-lowering drugs downregulate ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression in PBMCs of HC individuals and exhibit differential effects on HepG2 cells. Moreover, they indicate that the ABCA1 and ABCG1 transcript levels were not correlated directly to LXR mRNA expression in both cell models treated with lipid-lowering drugs.
Nuclear receptor crosstalk represents an important mechanism to expand the functions of individual receptors. The liver X receptors (LXR, NR1H2/3), both the α and β isoforms, are nuclear receptors that can be activated by the endogenous oxysterols and other synthetic agonists. LXRs function as cholesterol sensors, which protect mammals from cholesterol overload. LXRs have been shown to regulate the expression of a battery of metabolic genes, especially those involved in lipid metabolism. LXRs have recently been suggested to play a novel role in the regulation of drug metabolism. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is a xenobiotic receptor that regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Disruption of CAR alters sensitivity to toxins, increasing or decreasing it depending on the compounds. More recently, additional roles for CAR have been discovered. These include the involvement of CAR in lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, CAR forms an intricate regulatory network with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, foremost the LXRs, in exerting its effect on lipid metabolism. Retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs, NR1F1/2/3) have three isoforms, α, β and γ. Recent reports have shown that loss of RORα and/or RORγ can positively or negatively influence the expression of multiple drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the liver. The effects of RORs on expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes were reasoned to be, at least in part, due to the crosstalk with LXR. This review focuses on the CAR-LXR and ROR-LXR crosstalk, and the implications of this crosstalk in drug metabolism and lipid metabolism.
Steroids are small molecule hormones derived from cholesterol. Steroids affect many tissues, including the brain. In the zebra finch, estrogenic steroids are particularly interesting because they masculinize the neural circuit that controls singing and their synthesis in the brain is modulated by experience. Here, we analyzed the zebra finch genome assembly to assess the content, conservation, and organization of genes that code for components of the estrogen-synthetic pathway and steroid nuclear receptors. Based on these analyses, we also investigated neural expression of a cholesterol transport protein gene in the context of song neurobiology.
We present sequence-based analysis of twenty steroid-related genes using the genome assembly and other resources. Generally, zebra finch genes showed high homology to genes in other species. The diversity of steroidogenic enzymes and receptors may be lower in songbirds than in mammals; we were unable to identify all known mammalian isoforms of the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase families in the zebra finch genome assembly, and not all splice sites described in mammals were identified in the corresponding zebra finch genes. We did identify two factors, Nobox and NR1H2-RXR, that may be important for coordinated transcription of multiple steroid-related genes. We found very little qualitative overlap in predicted transcription factor binding sites in the genes for two cholesterol transport proteins, the 18 kDa cholesterol transport protein (TSPO) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). We therefore performed in situ hybridization for TSPO and found that its mRNA was not always detected in brain regions where StAR and steroidogenic enzymes were previously shown to be expressed. Also, transcription of TSPO, but not StAR, may be regulated by the experience of hearing song.
The genes required for estradiol synthesis and action are represented in the zebra finch genome assembly, though the complement of steroidogenic genes may be smaller in birds than in mammals. Coordinated transcription of multiple steroidogenic genes is possible, but results were inconsistent with the hypothesis that StAR and TSPO mRNAs are co-regulated. Integration of genomic and neuroanatomical analyses will continue to provide insights into the evolution and function of steroidogenesis in the songbird brain.
Tertiary sulfonamides were identified in a HTS as dual liver X receptor (LXR, NR1H2, and NR1H3) ligands, and the binding affinity of the series was increased through iterative analogue synthesis. A ligand-bound cocrystal structure was determined which elucidated key interactions for high binding affinity. Further characterization of the tertiary sulfonamide series led to the identification of high affinity LXR antagonists. GSK2033 (17) is the first potent cell-active LXR antagonist described to date. 17 may be a useful chemical probe to explore the cell biology of this orphan nuclear receptor.
The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors alpha and gamma (RORalpha [NR1F1] and RORgamma [NR1F3]) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. These 2 receptors regulate many physiological processes including development, metabolism and immunity. We recently found that certain oxysterols, namely the 7-substituted oxysterols, bound to the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of RORalpha and RORgamma with high affinity, altered the LBD conformation and reduced coactivator binding resulting in suppression of the constitutive transcriptional activity of these two receptors. Here, we show that another oxysterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), is also a high affinity ligand for RORalpha and RORgamma (K(i) approximately 25 nM). 24S-OHC is also known as cerebrosterol due to its high level in the brain where it plays an essential role as an intermediate in cholesterol elimination from the CNS. 24S-OHC functions as a RORalpha/gamma inverse agonist suppressing the constitutive transcriptional activity of these receptors in cotransfection assays. Additionally, 24S-OHC suppressed the expression of several RORalpha target genes including BMAL1 and REV-ERBalpha in a ROR-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that 24S-OHC decreases the ability of RORalpha to recruit the coactivator SRC-2 when bound to the BMAL1 promoter. We also noted that 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol selectively suppressed the activity of RORgamma. These data indicate that RORalpha and RORgamma may serve as sensors of oxsterols. Thus, RORalpha and RORgamma display an overlapping ligand preference with another class of oxysterol nuclear receptors, the liver X receptors (LXRalpha [NR1H3] and LXRbeta [NR1H2]).
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that are activated by endogenous oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol. There are two isoforms of LXR, LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2). Both LXRalpha and LXRbeta regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences associated with target genes as heterodimers with isoforms of the retinoid X receptor (RXR), RXRalpha (NR2B1), RXRbeta (NR2B2), and RXRgamma (NR2B3). LXRs act as cholesterol sensors: when cellular oxysterols accumulate as a result of increasing concentrations of cholesterol, LXR induces the transcription of genes that protect cells from cholesterol overload. In this review, we summarize the roles of LXRs in controlling cholesterol homeostasis, including their roles in bile acid synthesis and metabolism/excretion, reverse cholesterol transport, cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, and cholesterol absorption/excretion in the intestine. The overlapping and distinct roles of the LXRalpha and LXRbeta isoforms, and the potential use of LXRs as attractive targets for treatment of cardiovascular disease are also discussed.
The cessation of progesterone (P(4)) production (i.e. functional regression), arguably the key event in luteolysis of the primate corpus luteum (CL), is poorly understood. Previously, we found that genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol uptake decreased, while those involved in cholesterol efflux (reverse cholesterol transport, RCT) increased in expression during spontaneous functional regression of the rhesus macaque CL, thereby potentially depleting the cholesterol reserves needed for steroidogenesis. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the components necessary for RCT was performed. RCT components were expressed (mRNA and/or protein) in the macaque CL including cholesterol sensors (liver X receptors alpha or NR1H3; and beta or NR1H2), efflux proteins (ATP-binding cassette subfamilies A1 (ABCA1) and G1), acceptors (apolipoproteins A1 or APOA1; and E or APOE), and plasma proteins facilitating high-density lipoprotein formation (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase or LCAT; phospholipid transfer protein or PLTP). ABCA1, APOE, PLTP, and NR1H3 increased, while lipoprotein receptors decreased, in expression (mRNA and/or protein) through the period of functional regression. The expression of APOA1 and APOE, as well as NR1H3, was greatest in the CL and tissues involved in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Immunolocalization studies revealed that RCT proteins and lipoprotein receptors were expressed in large luteal cells, which possess intracellular cholesterol reserves during periods of P(4) synthesis. Lipid staining revealed changes in luteal cholesterol ester/lipid distribution that occurred following functional regression. These results indicate that decreased cholesterol uptake and increased RCT may be critical for the initiation of primate luteolysis by limiting intracellular cholesterol pools required for steroidogenesis.
The gene expression of 182 cardiovascular candidate genes was measured in high quality groups of individuals (n = 20) by microarrays to determine whether a subset of genes would discriminate obese and hypertensive individuals, in spite of the existence of a close link between these two cardiovascular risk factors.
The results were validated on the 20 subjects used for microarray analysis and on 62 additional individuals by real-time PCR.
The first analysis, where patient groups were compared with healthy subjects, revealed 15 out of 182 genes that differed in hypertensive, obese or obesity-related hypertensive individuals. These genes were ALOX5, APOA2, SELL, RGS2, CD14, FPR1, CAMP, DEFA3, DEFA4, CBS, CHRM1, ICAM1, NR1H2, SCNN1B and TGFB1. A second analysis was carried out in which patient groups were compared with each other, demonstrating FPR1 and DEFA3 as being significant genes discriminating patient groups. Furthermore, an analysis stratified by sex revealed that, with the exception of DEFA3, there are no other common genes between men and women.
We were able to indentify a number of interesting genes that distinguish patient and healthy subject groups as well as patient groups between them.
In addition, it seems that gender plays an important role, at least for some of the genes we tested. These findings may have important implications in the screening and etiology of hypertension or obesity, and could further help to focus on these specific mRNAs as antisense therapy targets.
We used a systems biology-based approach to investigate the basis of cell-specific expression of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal collecting duct. Computational analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the AQP2 gene (Genomatix) revealed 2 conserved clusters of putative transcriptional regulator (TR) binding elements (BEs) centered at -513 bp (corresponding to the SF1, NFAT, and FKHD TR families) and -224 bp (corresponding to the AP2, SRF, CREB, GATA, and HOX TR families). Three other conserved motifs corresponded to the ETS, EBOX, and RXR TR families. To identify TRs that potentially bind to these BEs, we carried out mRNA profiling (Affymetrix) in mouse mpkCCDc14 collecting duct cells, revealing expression of 25 TRs that are also expressed in native inner medullary collecting duct. One showed a significant positive correlation with AQP2 mRNA abundance among mpkCCD subclones (Ets1), and 2 showed a significant negative correlation (Elf1 and an orphan nuclear receptor Nr1h2). Transcriptomic profiling in native proximal tubules (PT), medullary thick ascending limbs (MTAL), and IMCDs from kidney identified 14 TRs (including Ets1 and HoxD3) expressed in the IMCD but not PT or MTAL (candidate AQP2 enhancer roles), and 5 TRs (including HoxA5, HoxA9 and HoxA10) expressed in PT and MTAL but not in IMCD (candidate AQP2 repressor roles). In luciferase reporter assays, overexpression of 3 ETS family TRs transactivated the mouse proximal AQP2 promoter. The results implicate ETS family TRs in cell-specific expression of AQP2 and point to HOX, RXR, CREB and GATA family TRs as playing likely additional roles.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important transcriptional regulators of lipid homeostasis and proliferation in several cell types. However, the roles of LXRs in pancreatic beta cells have not been fully established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LXRs on pancreatic beta cell proliferation.
Gene expression was analysed using real-time RT-PCR. Transient transfection and reporter gene assays were used to determine the transcriptional activity of LXRs in pancreatic beta cells. Cell viability and proliferation were analysed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), DNA fluorometric, BrdU labelling and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assays. Cell cycle distribution was investigated by flow cytometry analysis. Adenovirus-based RNA interference was used to knockdown LXRalpha, LXRbeta and p27 in MIN6 cells and mouse islets.
We found that both Lxralpha (also known as Nr1h3) and Lxrbeta (also known as Nr1h2) were expressed and transactivated the LXR response element in HIT-T15 and MIN6 cells. Activation of LXRs dose-dependently inhibited pancreatic beta cell viability and proliferation. This was accompanied by beta cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Furthermore, LXR activation increased levels of the p27 protein by inhibiting its degradation. Knockdown of p27 reversed these effects of LXR activation on growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest.
Our observations indicate that LXR activation inhibits pancreatic beta cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest. A well-known regulator of pancreatic beta cell cycle progression, p27, is upregulated and mediates the effects of LXRs on growth inhibition in beta cells. These observations suggest the involvement of aberrant activation of LXR in beta cell mass inadequacy, which is an important step in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Cholesterol is critical for several cellular functions and essential for normal fetal development. Therefore, its metabolism is tightly controlled during all life stages. The liver X receptors-alpha (LXRalpha; NR1H3) and -beta (LXRbeta; NR1H2) are nuclear receptors that are of key relevance in coordinating cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether fetal cholesterol metabolism can be influenced in utero via pharmacological activation of LXR and whether this would have long-term effects on cholesterol homeostasis. Administration of the LXR agonist T0901317 to pregnant mice via their diet (0.015% wt/wt) led to induced fetal hepatic expression levels of the cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5/g8 and Abca1, higher plasma cholesterol levels, and lower hepatic cholesterol levels compared with controls. These profound changes during fetal development did not affect cholesterol metabolism in adulthood nor did they influence coping with a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet. This study shows that the LXR system is functional in fetal mice and susceptible to pharmacological activation. Despite massive changes in fetal cholesterol metabolism, regulatory mechanisms involved in cholesterol metabolism return to a "normal" state in offspring and allow coping with a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet.
Liver X Receptor-α (LXRα, also known as NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, a superfamily which includes the more widely known glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The LXRs are activated by physiologic sterol ligands (e.g., oxysterols) and by synthetic agonists. In recent years, our understanding of the importance of LXRs has expanded across several fields of (patho-)physiology. Perhaps best known from a sizeable literature as homeostatic 'cholesterol sensors' that drive transcriptional programs promoting cellular cholesterol efflux, 'reverse cholesterol transport,' and bile acid synthesis, more recent roles for LXRs in glucose homeostasis, atherosclerosis, and innate immunity have also been identified. These discoveries complement an emerging literature that continues to draw surprisingly intimate connections between host metabolism and host defense. The present review will discuss the roles of LXR in the signaling of metabolism and innate immunity, and the potential for synthetic LXR agonists as novel therapeutics in dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, disordered glucose metabolism, and inflammation.
Human implantation involves invasion of the uterine wall and remodeling of uterine arteries by extravillous cytotrophoblasts. Defects in these early steps of placental development lead to poor placentation and are often associated with preeclampsia, a frequent complication of human pregnancy. One of the complex mechanisms controlling trophoblast invasion involves the activation of the liver X receptor beta (or NR1H2, more commonly known as LXRbeta) by oxysterols known as potent LXR activators. This activation of LXRbeta leads to a decrease of trophoblast invasion. The identification of new target genes of LXR in the placenta could aid in the understanding of their physiological roles in trophoblast invasion. In the present study, we show that the endoglin (ENG) gene is a direct target of the liver X receptor alpha (NR1H3, also known as LXRalpha). ENG, whose gene is highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, is part of the transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor complex that binds several members of the TGFbeta superfamily. In the human placenta, ENG has been shown to be involved in the inhibition of trophoblast invasion. Treatment of human choriocarcinoma JAR cells with T0901317, a synthetic LXR-selective agonist, leads to a significant increase in ENG mRNA and protein levels. Using transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that LXR (as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor) is able to bind the ENG promoter on an LXR response element and mediates the activation of ENG gene expression by LXRalpha in JAR cells. This study suggests a novel mechanism by which LXR may regulate trophoblast invasion in pathological pregnancy such as preeclampsia.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a multisystem disorder caused primarily by a mutation in the npc1 gene. These studies evaluated the effect of genetic background, deletion of additional genes, and administration of several agents on the age at death in a murine model of this disorder. Such factors as differing strain background or genetic drift within a given background in the npc1(-/-) mouse significantly altered the age at death and the degree of organ disease. Genetic deletion of Siat9 (GM3 synthetase) or Nr1h2 [liver X receptor (LXR)beta] shortened the life of the npc1(-/-) animals. Daily treatment of the npc1(-/-) mice with an LXR agonist or administration of a single dose of cyclodextrin, with or without the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, significantly slowed neurodegeneration and increased the lifespan of these animals. These data illustrate that the age at death of the npc1(-/-) mouse can be significantly influenced by many factors, including differences in strain background, other inactivating gene mutations (Siat9 and lxrbeta), and administration of agents such as LXR agonists and, particularly, cyclodextrin. It is currently not clear which of these effects is nonspecific or which might relate directly to the molecular defect present in the NPC1 syndrome.
The nuclear receptors LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are attractive drug targets for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease due to their established role as regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. A large body of literature has recently indicated their important roles in glucose metabolism and particularly LXRbeta is important for proper insulin production in pancreas. In this study, we report that glucose induces transcription via the LXRB gene promoter. The transcription start site of the human LXRB gene was determined and we identified two highly conserved, and functional, ETS and Elk1 binding sites, respectively, in the LXRB gene promoter. The Elk1 binding site also bound the serum responsive factor (SRF). Mutation of these sites abolished binding. Furthermore, mutation of the binding sites or siRNA knockdown of SRF and Elk1 significantly reduced the promoter activity and impaired the glucose response. Our results indicate that the human LXRB gene is controlled by glucose, thereby providing a novel mechanism by which glucose regulates cellular functions via LXRbeta.
The liver X receptors, LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2), are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. LXRs play a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid metabolism. In addition, oral administration of LXR agonists to mice results in elevated hepatic fatty acid synthesis and steatosis and increased secretion of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein resulting in hypertriglyceridemia. This increased hepatic lipogenesis has been largely attributed to the LXR-dependent up-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression. However, it has been reported that treating Srebp-1c null mice with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 still results in enhanced expression of many lipogenic genes, suggesting additional mechanisms by which LXR can enhance hepatic lipogenesis. In this report, we identify the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) as an LXR target that independently enhances the up-regulation of select lipogenic genes. The ChREBP promoter contains functional LXR-binding sites that confer receptor-dependent binding and transactivation. We show that T0901317 treatment of mice is associated with up-regulation of the ChREBP target gene, liver-type pyruvate kinase. Therefore, activation of LXR not only increases ChREBP mRNA via enhanced transcription but also modulates ChREBP activity. This establishes LXR as a master lipogenic transcription factor, as it directly regulates both SREBP-1c and ChREBP to enhance hepatic fatty acid synthesis.
The nuclear oxysterol receptors liver X receptor-alpha [LXRalpha (NR1H3)] and LXRbeta (NR1H2) coordinately regulate genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Although both LXR subtypes are expressed in the brain, their roles in this tissue remain largely unexplored. In this report, we show that LXR agonists have marked effects on gene expression in murine brain tissue both in vitro and in vivo. In primary astrocyte cultures, LXR agonists regulated several established LXR target genes, including ATP binding cassette transporter A1, and enhanced cholesterol efflux. In contrast, little or no effect on gene expression or cholesterol efflux was detected in primary neuronal cultures. Treatment of mice with a selective LXR agonist resulted in the induction of several LXR target genes related to cholesterol homeostasis in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These data provide the first evidence that the LXRs regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system. Because dysregulation of cholesterol balance is implicated in central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's and Niemann-Pick disease, pharmacological manipulation of the LXRs may prove beneficial in the treatment of these disorders.
During the last three years there have been a plethora of publications on the liver X-activated receptors (LXRalpha, NR1H3, and LXRbeta, NR1H2), the farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR, NR1H4), and the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and the role these nuclear receptors play in controlling cholesterol, bile acid, lipoprotein and drug metabolism. The current interest in these nuclear receptors is high, in part, because they appear to be promising therapeutic targets for new drugs that have the potential to control lipid homeostasis. In this review we emphasize i) the role of LXR in controlling many aspects of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, ii) the expanded role of FXR in regulating genes that control not only bile acid metabolism but also lipoprotein metabolism, and iii) the regulation of bile acid transport/metabolism in response to bile acid-activated PXR.
The LXR nuclear receptors are intracellular sensors of cholesterol excess and are activated by various oxysterols. LXRs have been shown to regulate multiple genes of lipid metabolism, including ABCA1 (formerly known as ABC1). ABCA1 is a lipid pump that effluxes cholesterol and phospholipid out of cells. ABCA1 deficiency causes extremely low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, demonstrating the importance of ABCA1 in the formation of HDL. The present work shows that the acetyl-podocarpic dimer (APD) is a potent, selective agonist for both LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2). In transient transactivation assays, APD was approximately 1000-fold more potent, and yielded approximately 6-fold greater maximal stimulation, than the widely used LXR agonist 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol. APD induced ABCA1 mRNA levels, and increased efflux of both cholesterol and phospholipid, from multiple cell types. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements demonstrated that APD stimulated efflux of endogenous cholesterol, eliminating any possible artifacts of cholesterol labeling. For both mRNA induction and stimulation of cholesterol efflux, APD was found to be more effective than was cholesterol loading. Taken together, these data show that APD is a more effective LXR agonist than endogenous oxysterols. LXR agonists may therefore be useful for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, especially in the context of low HDL levels.
The nuclear oxysterol receptors LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) coordinately regulate the expression of genes involved in the transport and catabolism of cholesterol. In macrophages, LXR stimulates the transcription of genes encoding transporters involved in cholesterol efflux, which may limit the transformation of these cells into foam cells in response to lipid loading. Here, we report that natural and synthetic LXR ligands induce the expression of the LXRalpha gene in primary human macrophages and differentiated THP-1 macrophages. This regulation was not observed in primary human adipocytes or hepatocytes, a human intestinal cell line, or in any mouse tissue or cell line examined. The human LXRalpha gene was isolated, and the transcription initiation site delineated. Analysis of the LXRalpha promoter revealed a functional LXR/RXR binding site approximately 2.9 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. We conclude that LXRalpha regulates its own expression in human macrophages and that this response is likely to amplify the effects of oxysterols on reverse cholesterol transport. These findings underscore the importance of LXR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Recently, a number of nuclear receptors have been identified as key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Two of these, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) [1] and ubiquitous receptor (UR) (NR1H2) [1], appear to be involved in cholesterol reverse transport and disposal. LXRalpha null gene mice fail to adapt metabolically to high-cholesterol diets. We have recently shown that some 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid analogs are selective activators of LXRalpha. In this report, we show that these orally administered LXRalpha agonists have an overall hypolipidemic effect in hypercholesterolemic rats, mice and hamsters, which indicates that in these animal models, endogenous LXRalpha agonist is a limiting factor for induction of cholesterol disposal. Furthermore, in animals, these 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid analogs exhibit a unique pharmacokinetic profile and do not increase the serum triglyceride level; therefore, they may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for cholesterol management.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are important regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including ABCA1, ABCG1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Although it has been demonstrated that oxysterols are LXR ligands, little is known about the identity of the physiological activators of these receptors. Here we confirm earlier studies demonstrating a dose-dependent induction of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in human monocyte-derived macrophages by cholesterol loading. In addition, we show that formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid, products of CYP27 action on cholesterol, is dependent on the dose of cholesterol used to load the cells. Other proposed LXR ligands, including 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, could not be detected under these conditions. A role for CYP27 in regulation of cholesterol-induced genes was demonstrated by the following findings. 1) Introduction of CYP27 into HEK-293 cells conferred an induction of ABCG1 and SREBP-1c; 2) upon cholesterol loading, CYP27-expressing cells induce these genes to a greater extent than in control cells; 3) in CYP27-deficient human skin fibroblasts, the induction of ABCA1 in response to cholesterol loading was ablated; and 4) in a coactivator association assay, 27-hydroxycholesterol functionally activated LXR. We conclude that 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is an important pathway for LXR activation in response to cholesterol overload.
We have found that certain natural 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acids are receptor-specific activators of nuclear liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3), a nuclear receptor regulating the expression of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene, coding for the rate-limiting enzyme in the major pathway of bile acid synthesis. The LXR homolog, ubiquitous nuclear receptor (UR/LXRbeta) (NR1H2), was also activated by these bile acids, but at higher concentrations than for LXRalpha. Synthetic 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid analogs were synthesized with LXRalpha-selective agonistic activity, with potential to modulate cholesterol catabolism in hypercholesterolemia.
This study describes the expression of the OR-1 orphan receptor in embryonic, postnatal, and adult brain tissue studied by in situ hybridization. This newly characterized member of the nuclear receptor superfamily functions as a modulator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone signalling by influencing gene activation by these hormones from a distinct promoter region. In the fetal brain OR-1 mRNA was observed from E13-E16 in the developing pons, tegmentum, pontine flexure, medulla, inferior and superior colliculi, cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cortical plate. At E18, OR-1 was expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, ventricular layer of the developing cortex and cortical plate, striatum, and olfactory bulb. In the E21 to early postnatal brain the highest expression of OR-1 mRNA was seen in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, and olfactory bulb. The expression of OR-1 in the cerebellum increased during postnatal development and by d P21 OR-1 mRNA had reached the levels present in the adult in the cerebellar cortex. In the adult brain the highest expression of OR-1 mRNA was observed in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex. We conclude that OR-1 is widely expressed in the fetal brain, whereas in the postnatal and adult brains OR-1 mRNA is more discretely localized, and that the amount of OR-1 mRNA increases in the cerebellum during postnatal development. The results of this study suggest that, in the fetal brain, OR-1 has a spatially widespread role in modulating gene activation by retinoids and thyroid hormone, whereas in the adult brain this modulation occurs only in distinct neuronal populations.
The nuclear hormone receptors liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are established regulators of cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism and are attractive drug targets for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adrenal steroid hormones including glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are known to interfere with glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and blood pressure regulation. Here we present genome-wide expression profiles of LXR-responsive genes in both the adrenal and the pituitary gland. LXR activation in cultured adrenal cells inhibited expression of multiple steroidogenic genes and consequently decreased adrenal steroid hormone production. In addition, LXR agonist treatment elevated ACTH mRNA expression and hormone secretion from pituitary cells both in vitro and in vivo. Reduced expression of the glucocortioid-activating enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 in pituitary cells upon LXR activation suggests blunting of the negative feedback of glucocorticoids by LXRs. In conclusion, LXRs independently interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation at the level of the pituitary and the adrenal gland.
Deposition of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is thought to underlie development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This pathological linkage has spurred considerable interest in therapeutic strategies to reduce Abeta production. It is becoming increasingly clear that altered cholesterol homeostasis can modulate Abeta production and/or accumulation. In this review, we discuss the molecular pathology of AD, the cholesterol connection and recent data suggesting that the oxysterol receptor, liver X receptor LXR (NR1H2 and NR1H3), may modulate these events.
We have initiated a systematic analysis of the role of cholesterol metabolizing genes as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. As part of this analysis, we have assessed the NR1H2 gene on chromosome 19 and report here a modest association with the locus in sibpairs with late onset disease.
Cloning and characterization of the orphan nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) and pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) led to major breakthroughs in studying drug-mediated transcriptional induction of drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (CYPs). More recently, additional roles for CAR and PXR have been discovered. As examples, these xenosensors are involved in the homeostasis of cholesterol, bile acids, bilirubin, and other endogenous hydrophobic molecules in the liver: CAR and PXR thus form an intricate regulatory network with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, foremost the cholesterol-sensing liver X receptor (LXR, NR1H2/3) and the bile-acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4). In this review, functional interactions between these nuclear receptors as well as the consequences on physiology and pathophysiology of the liver are discussed.
We characterize the ability of the liver X receptor (LXRalpha [NR1H3] and LXRbeta [NR1H2]) agonist, T0901317, to activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR [NR4H4]). Although T0901317 is a much more potent activator of LXR than FXR, this ligand actually activates FXR more potently than a natural bile acid FXR ligand, chenodeoxycholic acid. Thus, the FXR activity of T0901317 must be considered when utilizing this agonist as a pharmacological tool to investigate LXR function.
To ascertain whether distinct chromosomal loci existed that were linked to severe obesity, as well as to utilize the increased heritability of this excessive phenotype, we performed a genome-wide scan in severely obese French Caucasians. The 109 selected pedigrees, totaling 447 individuals, required both the proband and a sibling to be severely obese (BMI &gt;or=35 kg/m(2)), and 84.8% of the nuclear families possessed &gt;or=1 morbidly obese sibling (BMI &gt;or=40). Severe and morbid obesity are still relatively rare in France, with rates of 2.5 and 0.6%, respectively. The initial genome scan consisted of 395 evenly spaced microsatellite markers. Six regions were found to have suggestive linkage on 4q, 6cen-q, 17q, and 19q for a BMI &gt;or=35 phenotypic subset, and 5q and 10q for an inclusive BMI &gt;or=27 group. The highest peak on chromosome 19q (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.59) was significant by genome scan simulation testing (P = 0.042). These regions then underwent second-stage mapping with an additional set of 42 markers. BMI &gt;or=35 analysis defined regions on 17q23.3-25.1 and 19q13.33-13.43 with an maximum likelihood score LOD of 3.16 and 3.21, respectively. Subsequent pooled data analysis with an additional previous population of 66 BMI &gt;or=35 sib-pairs led to a significant LOD score of 3.8 at the 19q locus (empirical P = 0.023). For more moderate obesity and overweight susceptibility loci, BMI &gt;or=27 analysis confirmed suggestive linkage to chromosome regions 5q14.3-q21.3 (LOD = 2.68) and 10q24.32-26.2 (LOD = 2.47). Plausible positional candidate genes include NR1H2 and TULP2.
Natural products have been identified as ligands for a number of members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily. Often these natural products are used as dietary supplements to treat myriad ailments ranging from perimenopausal hot flashes to hypercholesterolemia and reduced cognitive function. Examples of some natural product ligands for NHRs include genestein (estrogen receptors NR3A1 and NR3A2), guggulsterone (farnesoid X receptor NR1H4), and St. John's wort (pregnane X receptor, NR1I2). In this study, we identified the first nonoxysterol natural product that functions as a ligand for the liver X receptor (LXRalpha and LXRbeta; NR1H3, NR1H2), a NHR that acts as the receptor for oxysterols and plays a key role in regulation of cholesterol metabolism and transport as well as glucose metabolism. We show that paxilline, a fungal metabolite, is an efficacious agonist of both LXRalpha and LXRbeta in biochemical and in vitro cell-based assays. Paxilline binds directly to both receptors and is an activator of LXR-dependent transcription in cell-based reporter assays. We also demonstrate that paxilline binding to the receptors results in efficient activation of transcription of two physiological LXR target genes, ABCA1 and SREBP. The discovery of paxilline, the first reported nonoxysterol natural product ligand of the LXRs, may provide insight into the mechanism of ligand recognition by these receptors and reaffirms the utility of examining natural product libraries for identifying novel NHR ligands.
Defining complete sets of gene family members from diverse species provides the foundation for comparative studies. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have defined the entire nuclear receptor complement within the first available complete sequence of a non-human vertebrate (the teleost fish Fugu rubripes). In contrast to the human set (48 total nuclear receptors), we found 68 nuclear receptors in the Fugu genome. All 68 Fugu receptors had a clear human homolog, thus defining no new nuclear receptor subgroups. A reciprocal analysis showed that each human receptor had one or more Fugu orthologs, excepting CAR (NR1I3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2). These 68 receptors add striking diversity to the known nuclear receptor superfamily and provide important comparators to human nuclear receptors. We have compared several pharmacologically relevant human nuclear receptors (FXR, LXRalpha/beta, CAR, PXR, VDR and PPARalpha/gamma/delta) to their Fugu orthologs. This comparison included expression analysis across five Fugu tissue types. All of the Fugu receptors that were analyzed by PCR in this study were expressed, indicating that the majority of the additional Fugu receptors are likely to be functional.
The structures of the liver X receptor LXRbeta (NR1H2) have been determined in complexes with two synthetic ligands, T0901317 and GW3965, to 2.1 and 2.4 A, respectively. Together with its isoform LXRalpha (NR1H3) it regulates target genes involved in metabolism and transport of cholesterol and fatty acids. The two LXRbeta structures reveal a flexible ligand-binding pocket that can adjust to accommodate fundamentally different ligands. The ligand-binding pocket is hydrophobic but with polar or charged residues at the two ends of the cavity. T0901317 takes advantage of this by binding to His-435 close to H12 while GW3965 orients itself with its charged group in the opposite direction. Both ligands induce a fixed "agonist conformation" of helix H12 (also called the AF-2 domain), resulting in a transcriptionally active receptor.
The Liver X Receptors (LXR alpha, NR1H3; LXR beta, NR1H2) encode highly homologous transcription factors that are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of proteins. Both LXR alpha and LXR beta form heterodimers with the obligate partner 9-cis retinoic acid receptor alpha (RXR alpha; NR2B1). LXR/RXR heterodimers function as sensors for cellular oxysterols and, when activated by these agonists, increase the expression of genes that control sterol and fatty acid metabolism/homeostasis. These conclusions are based on studies that: (i) identified oxysterols as the natural ligands for both LXR alpha and LXR beta; (ii) identified target genes that are activated by LXR/RXR; (iii) generated mice that were deficient in LXR alpha, LXR beta or both LXR alpha and LXR beta; (iv) identified synthetic LXR ligands that were extremely potent in vivo; and (v) demonstrated significant alterations in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis in animals in which LXR had been either activated or deleted. These findings suggest that synthetic LXR ligands may prove useful in the treatment of certain dyslipidemias. In this review, we summarize the current status of this rapidly moving area with a special emphasis on the potential for pharmacological intervention.
The aim of this study was to elucidate aspects of diabetes mellitus-induced suppression of aneurysm. We hypothesized that high glucose suppresses aneurysm by inhibiting macrophage activation via activation of Nr1h2 (also known as liver X receptor β), recently characterized as a glucose-sensing nuclear receptor.
Calcium phosphate (CaPO4)-induced aneurysm formation was significantly suppressed in the arterial wall in type 1 and 2 diabetic mice. A murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was treated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) plus CaPO4 and showed a significant increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) mRNA and secreted protein expression compared with TNF-α alone. Elevated Mmp9 expression was significantly suppressed by hyperglycemic conditions (15.5 mmol/L glucose) compared with normoglycemic conditions (5.5 mmol/L glucose) or normoglycemic conditions with high osmotic pressure (5.5 mmol/L glucose +10.0 mmol/L mannitol). Nr1h2 mRNA and protein expression were suppressed by treatment with TNF-α plus CaPO4 but were restored by hyperglycemic conditions. Activation of Nr1h2 by the antagonist GW3965 during stimulation with TNF-α plus CaPO4 mimicked hyperglycemic conditions and inhibited Mmp9 upregulation, whereas the deactivation of Nr1h2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) under hyperglycemic conditions canceled the suppressive effect and restored Mmp9 expression induced by TNF-α plus CaPO4. Moreover, Nr1h2 activation with GW3965 significantly suppressed CaPO4-induced aneurysm in mice compared with vehicle-injected control mice.
Our results show that hyperglycemia suppresses macrophage activation and aneurysmal degeneration through the activation of Nr1h2. Although further validation of the underlying pathway is necessary, targeting Nr1h2 is a potential therapeutic approach to treating aneurysm.
To investigate whether the ingestion of olive oil having different phenolic contents influences the expression of blood pressure-related genes, involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in healthy humans.
A randomized, double-blind, crossover human trial with 18 healthy subjects, who ingested 25 mL/day of olive oils (1) high (366 mg/kg, HPC) and (2) low (2.7 mg/kg, LPC) in phenolic compounds for 3 weeks, preceded by 2-week washout periods. Determination of selected blood pressure-related gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by qPCR, blood pressure and systemic biomarkers.
HPC decreased systolic blood pressure compared to pre-intervention values and to LPC, and maintained diastolic blood pressure values compared to LPC. HPC decreased ACE and NR1H2 gene expressions compared with pre-intervention values, and IL8RA gene expression compared with LPC.
The introduction to the diet of an extra-virgin olive oil rich in phenolic compounds modulates the expression of some of the genes related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These changes could underlie the decrease in systolic blood pressure observed.
Sea cucumbers have been consumed as tonic, food, and nutrition supplements for many years.
The objective of this study is to investigate the antiobesity and lipid-lowering effects of sea cucumber extracts in in vitro and in vivo models and elucidate the mechanism of action of the extracts on obesity and dyslipidemia.
The 60% ethanol extracts from the body walls of 10 different sea cucumbers were investigated for the inhibition of pancreatic lipase (PL) activity in vitro. The optimal active extract (SC-3) was further chemically analyzed by LC-MS and UV. And 0.1% and 0.2% of SC-3 was mixed with a high-fat diet to treat C57/BL6 mice for 6 weeks or 2 weeks as preventive and therapeutic study. The body weight, serum, and liver lipid profile in the mice were investigated.
The crude extract of Pearsonothuria graeffei Semper (Holothuriidae) inhibited the PL activity by 36.44% of control at 0.5 μg/mL. SC-3 and echinoside A inhibited PL with an IC50 value at 2.86 μg/mL and 0.76 μM. 0.1% of SC-3 reduced the body weight (23.0 ± 0.62 versus 26.3 ± 0.76 g), the serum TC (2.46 ± 0.04 versus 2.83 ± 0.12 mmol/L), TG (0.19 ± 0.08 versus 0.40 ± 0.03 mmo/L), and LDL-c (0.48 ± 0.02 versus 0.51 ± 0.02 mmol/L), and liver TC (1.19 ± 0.17 versus 1.85 ± 0.13 mmol/mg) and TG (6.18 ± 0.92 versus 10.87 ± 0.97 mmol/mg) contents of the obese C57BL/six mice on a high-fat diet.
Sea cucumber may be used for developing antiobesity and antihyperlipidemia drugs.
In nonprimate species, it has been well established that prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2alpha) initiates luteolysis. Changes in intracellular cholesterol concentrations caused by modulation of cholesterol uptake and efflux may mediate PGF2alpha-induced luteolysis. These changes in cholesterol efflux and uptake are controlled, in part, by the liver x receptors (LXR) alpha (NR1H3) and beta (NR1H2), nuclear receptors that increase expression of genes necessary for cholesterol efflux or limiting cholesterol uptake. Therefore, we hypothesized that PGF2alpha reduces expression of cholesterol uptake and increases expression of cholesterol efflux genes, mediated in part by enhanced LXR activity. To test this hypothesis, an induced luteolysis model was used whereby ewes were treated during their midluteal phase with saline or PGF2alpha and corpora lutea (CL) collected 12, 24, or 48 h later for determination of mRNA and protein concentrations by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. As a complementary approach, CL undergoing spontaneous luteolysis were compared to midluteal phase CL. The lipoprotein receptors responsible for cholesterol uptake were significantly decreased in both luteolysis models. Expression of the LXR target gene ATP binding cassette subfamily A1 (ABCA1), an important mediator of cholesterol efflux, was significantly increased in both experimental models. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that PGF2alpha treatment resulted in enhanced NR1H3 and NR1H2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter. Qualitative changes in lipid droplet distribution were also observed following PGF2alpha treatment. These data support the hypothesis that reduced cholesterol uptake and increased efflux mediate luteolysis in sheep, which is partially controlled by PGF2alpha stimulation of LXR activity. 
Meat intake is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in order to identify biological pathways involved in meat carcinogenesis. We performed a literature search of PubMed and Embase using "interaction", "meat", "polymorphisms", and "colorectal cancer", and data on meat-gene interactions were extracted. The studies were divided according to whether information on meat intake was collected prospectively or retrospectively. In prospective studies, interactions between meat intake and polymorphisms in PTGS2 (encoding COX-2), ABCB1, IL10, NFKB1, MSH3, XPC (P int = 0.006, 0.01, 0.04, 0.03, 0.002, 0.01, respectively), but not IL1B, HMOX1, ABCC2, ABCG2, NR1I2 (encoding PXR), NR1H2 (encoding LXR), NAT1, NAT2, MSH6, or MLH1 in relation to CRC were found. Interaction between a polymorphism in XPC and meat was found in one prospective and one case-control study; however, the directions of the risk estimates were opposite. Thus, none of the findings were replicated. The results from this systematic review suggest that genetic variation in the inflammatory response and DNA repair pathway is involved in meat-related colorectal carcinogenesis, whereas no support for the involvement of heme and iron from meat or cooking mutagens was found. Further studies assessing interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in relation to CRC in large well-characterised prospective cohorts with relevant meat exposure are warranted. 
Liver-X-receptors, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), encode 2 different but highly homologous isoforms of transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Whether LXRα and LXRβ subtypes have discrete roles in the regulation of cardiac physiology/pathology is unknown. We determine the role of each LXR subtype in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury.
Mice (wild type; those genetically depleted of LXRα, LXRβ, or both; and those overexpressing LXRα or LXRβ by in vivo intramyocardial adenoviral vector) were subjected to MI/R injury. Both LXRα and LXRβ were detected in wild-type mouse heart. LXRα, but not LXRβ, was significantly upregulated after MI/R. Dual activation of LXRα and LXRβ by natural and synthetic agonists reduced myocardial infarction and improved contractile function after MI/R. Mechanistically, LXR activation inhibited MI/R-induced oxidative stress and nitrative stress, attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in ischemic/reperfused myocardium. The aforementioned cardioprotective effects of LXR agonists were impaired in the setting of cardiac-specific gene silencing of LXRα, but not LXRβ subtype. Moreover, LXRα/β double-knockout and LXRα-knockout mice, but not LXRβ-knockout mice, increased MI/R injury, exacerbated MI/R-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, and aggravated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, cardiac LXRα, not LXRβ, overexpression via adenoviral transfection suppressed MI/R injury.
Our study provides the first direct evidence that the LXRα, but not LXRβ, subtype is a novel endogenous cardiac protective receptor against MI/R injury. Drug development strategies specifically targeting LXRα may be beneficial in treating ischemic heart disease.
Gestational diabetes (GD) alters normal fetal development and is related to a diabetogenic effect in the progeny. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are considered to be potential drug targets for the regulation, treatment, or prevention of diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate early and late changes of LXR in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of the male and female offspring of control (CO) and diabetic (DO) mothers. We used an experimental model of streptozotocin-induced GD to assess the protein expression of LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) by western blotting. The tissues were obtained from CO and DO animals at postnatal day 1 (1D), day 10 (10D), and day 35 (35D) and 9 months (9M). In CO, the LXR expression showed significant differences among the groups, which were tissue- and receptor-specific (P&lt;0.05). Sex differences in CO were found only in the hypothalamus for LXRβ expression at 35D and 9M (P&lt;0.05). When CO and DO were compared, differences between them were observed in the majority of the studied groups at 1D (male hippocampus, LXRα 31% and LXRβ 161%; female hippocampus, LXRβ 165%; male hypothalamus, LXRβ 182%; and female hypothalamus, LXRα 85%; P&lt;0.05). However, these differences disappeared later with the exception of LXRβ expression in the male hypothalamus (P&lt;0.05). The area under the curve during the glucose tolerance test correlated negatively with LXRβ in CO but not in DO animals. Moreover, in a male DO subpopulation this correlation was positive as it occurs in intolerant animals. These results indicate that GD affects hypothalamic LXR expression differently in male and female offspring. 
The nuclear receptor liver X receptor [LXR] is activated by endogenous oxidized derivatives of cholesterol. It constitutes a critical receptor in the regulation of various physiological functions related to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, as well as various other disorders. Both isoforms of LXR, LXRα [NR1H3] and LXRβ [NR1H2], form heterodimers with the isoforms of the retinoid X receptor [RXR], which then regulate the gene expression by binding to DNA sequences associated with target genes. LXR acts as a cholesterol sensor in response to an increased concentration of cholesterol in cells and induces the transcription of genes that protect cells from cholesterol overload. LXRs play numerous roles in controlling cholesterol homeostasis via their actions on bile acid synthesis and metabolism/excretion, reverse cholesterol transport and cholesterol absorption/excretion in the intestines. Therefore, these receptors show great potential as pharmacological targets for anti-atherosclerotic activities. Recent discoveries have also emphasized the important involvement of LXRs in the pathogenesis of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, adrenal steroid synthesis, skin aging and male fertility. However, LXR activation has also been shown to stimulate lipogenesis via sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, leading to liver steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. This review summarizes recent scientific discoveries and the biological actions of LXR with a special focus on the involvement of this type of receptor in important diseases and conditions. 
Liver X receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear hormone receptors that are widely expressed in the kidney. They promote cholesterol efflux from cells and inhibit inflammatory responses by regulating gene transcription. Here, we hypothesised (1) that LXR deficiency would promote renal decline in a mouse model of diabetes by accelerating intraglomerular cholesterol accumulation and, conversely, (2) that LXR agonism would attenuate renal decline in diabetes.
Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) and maintained for 14 weeks in Lxrα/β (+/+) (Lxrα, also known as Nr1h3; Lxrβ, also known as Nr1h2) and Lxrα/β (-/-) mice. In addition, STZ-injected DBA/2J mice were treated with vehicle or the LXR agonist N,N-dimethyl-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) (80 mg/kg daily) for 10 weeks. To determine the role of cholesterol in diabetic nephropathy (DN), mice were placed on a Western diet after hyperglycaemia developed.
Even in the absence of diabetes, Lxrα/β (-/-) mice exhibited a tenfold increase in the albumin:creatinine ratio and a 40-fold increase in glomerular lipid accumulation compared with Lxrα/β (+/+) mice. When challenged with diabetes, Lxrα/β (-/-) mice showed accelerated mesangial matrix expansion and glomerular lipid accumulation, with upregulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. In the DN-sensitive STZ DBA/2J mouse model, DMHCA treatment significantly decreased albumin and nephrin excretion (by 50% each), glomerular lipids and plasma triacylglycerol (by 70%) and cholesterol (by 48%); it also decreased kidney inflammatory and oxidative stress markers compared with vehicle-treated mice.
These data support the idea that LXR plays an important role in the normal and diabetic kidney, while showing that LXR, through its inhibitory effect on inflammation and cholesterol accumulation in glomeruli, could also be a novel therapeutic target for DN.
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is considered to be a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. It is characterized by central adiposity, high blood pressure, glucose intolerance and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism. The cause of MetS is likely to be due to a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Liver X receptors alpha (NR1H3) and beta (NR1H2) play a key role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of genetic polymorphisms in the LXRs to risk of MetS and related traits. Two common SNPs in NR1H3 (rs11039155 and rs2279238) and in NR1H2 (rs17373080 and rs2695121) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in MetS patients (n=265) and controls (n=219). Logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) as a measure of association of genotypes with the presence of MetS and related phenotypes. Although The NR1H2 polymorphism rs2695121 was nominally associated with MetS but correction for multiple-testing and adjustment for age, sex and number of MetS criteria, failed to identify any significant interactions associated with prevalence of MetS. However in the haplotype analysis, a LXRα haplotype AC, was more common in controls and was associated with a significant protective effect for MetS (OR [95% CI]=0.25 [0.07-0.88], p=0.031). In conclusion, this study suggests that the above-named variants in LXRα and LXRβ genes are not potential contributors to the risk of MetS and related traits in an Iranian population.
The ability of cells to precisely control gene expression in response to intracellular and extracellular signals plays an important role in both normal physiology and in pathological settings. For instance, the accumulation of excess cholesterol by macrophages initiates a genetic response mediated by the liver X receptors (LXRs)-α (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), which facilitates the transport of cholesterol out of cells to high-density lipoprotein particles. Studies using synthetic LXR agonists have also demonstrated that macrophage LXR activation simultaneously induces a second network of genes that promotes fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis that may support the detoxification of excess free cholesterol by storage in the ester form. We now show that treatment of human THP-1 macrophages with endogenous or synthetic LXR ligands stimulates both transcriptional and posttranscriptional pathways that result in the selective recruitment of the LXRα subtype to LXR-regulated promoters. Interestingly, when human or mouse macrophages are loaded with cholesterol under conditions that mimic the development of atherogenic macrophage foam cells, a selective LXR response is generated that induces genes mediating cholesterol transport but does not coordinately regulate genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. The gene-selective response to cholesterol loading occurs, even in the presence of LXRα binding to the promoter of the gene encoding the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, the master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid synthesis. The ability of promoter bound LXRα to recruit RNA polymerase to the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c promoter, however, appears to be ligand selective. 
The regulation of lipid metabolism is central to energy homeostasis in higher multicellular organisms. Lipid homeostasis depends on factors that are able to transduce metabolic parameters into regulatory events representing the fundamental components of the general control system. Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors implicated in various physiological functions including energy metabolism. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), initially identified as a xenobiotic-sensing receptor, may also have roles in lipid homeostasis. The nuclear receptors liver X receptors (LXRs, NR1H2/3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, NR1C) have been known for their roles in lipid metabolism. LXR is a sterol sensor that promotes lipogenesis, whereas PPARα controls a variety of genes in several pathways of lipid metabolism. This chapter focuses primarily on the role of CAR in lipid metabolism directly or through its cross talk with LXRs and PPARα.
Liver X receptor (LXR) α and LXR β (NR1H3 and NR1H2) are oxysterol-activated nuclear receptors involved in the control of major metabolic pathways such as cholesterol homeostasis, lipogenesis, inflammation and innate immunity. Synthetic LXR agonists are currently under development and could find applications in various fields such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. The clinical development of LXR agonists requires the identification of biological markers for pharmacodynamic studies. In this context, monocytes represent an attractive target to monitor LXR activation. They are easily accessible cells present in peripheral blood; they express LXR α and β and respond to LXR agonist stimulation in vitro. The aim of our study was to identify cell surface markers of LXR agonists on monocytes. For this, we focused on clusters of differentiation (CD) markers because they are well characterized and accessible cell surface molecules allowing easy immuno-phenotyping.
By using microarray analysis of monocytes treated or not with an LXR agonist in vitro, we selected three CD, i.e. CD82, CD226, CD244 for further analysis by real time PCR and flow cytometry. The three CD were up-regulated by LXR agonist treatment in vitro in a time- and dose- dependent manner and this induction was LXR specific as assessed by a SiRNA or LXR antagonist strategy. By using flow cytometry, we could demonstrate that the expression of these molecules at the cell surface of monocytes was significantly increased after LXR agonist treatment.
We have identified three new cell surface markers that could be useful to monitor LXR activation. Future studies will be required to confirm the biological and diagnostic significance of the markers.
During the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that consistent changes in the levels of expression of a small cohort of genes accompany the aging of mammalian tissues. In many cases, these changes have been shown to generate features that are characteristic of the senescent phenotype. Previously, a small pilot study indicated that some of these changes might be reversed in rat liver, if the liver cells became malignant and were proliferating. The present study has tested the hypothesis that inducing proliferation in old rat liver can reset the levels of expression of these age-related genes to that observed in young tissue. A microarray approach was used to identify genes that exhibited the greatest changes in their expression during aging. The levels of expression of these markers were then examined in transcriptomes of both proliferating hepatomas from old animals and old rat liver lobes that had regenerated after partial hepatectomy but were again quiescent. We have found evidence that over 20 % of the aging-related genes had their levels of expression reset to young levels by stimulating proliferation, even in cells that had undergone a limited number of cell cycles and then become quiescent again. Moreover, our network analysis indicated alterations in MAPK/ERK and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways and the potential important role of PAX3, VCAN, ARRB2, NR1H2, and ITGA5 that may provide insights into mechanisms involved in longevity and regeneration that are distinct from cancer.
The expressions of genes involved in cholesterol efflux increase, whereas those involved in extracellular cholesterol uptake decrease, during spontaneous functional regression of the primate corpus luteum (CL). This may result from liver x receptor (LXR) alpha (official symbol NR1H3) and/or beta (official symbol NR1H2) control of luteal gene transcription, because these nuclear receptor superfamily members are key regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Therefore, studies were conducted to assess endogenous LXR ligands in the primate CL through the luteal phase, and to determine the effect of synthetic or natural LXR ligands on cholesterol efflux and uptake in functional primate luteal cells. Using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, three LXR ligands were identified and quantified in the rhesus macaque CL, including 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22ROH), 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH), and desmosterol. Levels of 22ROH paralleled serum progesterone concentrations, whereas mean levels of 27OH tended to be higher following the loss of progesterone synthesis. Desmosterol was present throughout the luteal phase. Functional macaque luteal cells treated with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 or physiologically relevant concentrations of the endogenous luteal ligands 22ROH, 27OH, and desmosterol had increased expression of various known LXR target genes and greater cholesterol efflux. Additionally, T0901317 reduced low-density lipoprotein receptor protein and extracellular low-density lipoprotein uptake, whereas 27OH decreased low-density lipoprotein receptor protein, most likely via a posttranslational mechanism. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that LXR activation causes increased cholesterol efflux and decreased extracellular cholesterol uptake. In theory, these effects could deplete the primate CL of cholesterol needed for steroidogenesis, ultimately contributing to functional regression.
Preeclampsia is a frequent complication of pregnancy and a leading cause of perinatal mortality. Both genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified. Lipid metabolism, particularly cholesterol metabolism, is associated with this disease. Liver X receptors alpha (NR1H3, also known as LXRalpha) and beta (NR1H2, also known as LXRbeta) play a key role in lipid metabolism. They belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and are activated by cholesterol derivatives. They have been implicated in preeclampsia because they modulate trophoblast invasion and regulate the expression of the endoglin (CD105) gene, a marker of preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between the NR1H3 and NR1H2 genes and preeclampsia.
We assessed associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms of NR1H3 (rs2279238 and rs7120118) and NR1H2 (rs35463555 and rs2695121) and the disease in 155 individuals with preeclampsia and 305 controls. Genotypes were determined by high-resolution melting analysis. We then used a logistic regression model to analyze the different alleles and genotypes for those polymorphisms as a function of case/control status.
We found no association between NR1H3 SNPs and the disease, but the NR1H2 polymorphism rs2695121 was found to be strongly associated with preeclampsia (genotype C/C: adjusted odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04-4.05; p = 0.039 and genotype T/C: adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01-3.42; p = 0.049).
This study provides the first evidence of an association between the NR1H2 gene and preeclampsia, adding to our understanding of the links between cholesterol metabolism and this disease.
Liver X receptor [LXR; nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 2 (NR1H2, alias LXRB)] can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Its relationship with disease severity is not known.
Expression of LXRB, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), apolipoprotein E (APOE) and paraoxonase 2 (PON2) were determined in 69 breast tumors and were related to clinical stages of the disease and tumor characteristics, as well as time to recurrence.
ABCG1 expression differed with the tumor Scarff Bloom and Richardson (SBR) status (p=0.02), with a lower expression in SBRIII than in SBRII and SBRI. ABCG1 expression was significantly higher in estrogen receptor-positive tumors (N=63) (p=0.02). APOE expression was significantly lower in progesterone receptor-positive tumors (N=55) (p=0.03). No relationship with time to recurrence was observed.
Expression of some LXR-dependent genes is related to breast tumor characteristics, but not time to recurrence. This may be due to a lack of study power or too short a follow-up time.
Although male gender, aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking are common risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm, diabetes mellitus is an independent negative risk factor. In aneurysm tissue, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expressed by activated macrophages degrades extracellular matrix proteins. In our previous experimental study, we demonstrated that the aneurysmal formation and macrophage activity were suppressed by inhibiting mimicking hyperglycemia (HG) through upregulation of glucose-sensing nuclear receptor, Nr1h2. Here in this study, we focused on the role of HG-induced altered glucose uptake on macrophage activation.
RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells were pretreated in cultures containing HG (HG group, 15.5 mM) or normal glucose (NG) concentrations (NG group, 5.5 mM) for 7 d. The culture medium was then changed in both groups to NG conditions, and the cells were stimulated with recombinant murine soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (sRANKL). Macrophage activation was confirmed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
Compared with the NG group, MMP-9 expression in the HG group was significantly suppressed. Glucose uptake was increased in the NG group but not in the HG group during macrophage activation. To determine the mechanism of activation, we studied the expression and distribution of glucose transporters (Gluts) in the macrophages. Although Glut expression was unaffected by glucose pretreatment, membrane translocation of Glut-1 was significantly enhanced in macrophages in the NG group but not in the HG group during activation. Insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) messenger RNA, known stimulate to membrane translocation of Gluts, were both decreased by the HG condition but not by the NG condition.
HG pretreatment suppressed the macrophage activation. sRANKL increased macrophage glucose uptake at NG concentrations, which was impaired by HG pretreatment through the inhibition of Glut1 membrane translocation and the insulin receptor and IRS-1 gene transcription. These data suggest that HG suppressed macrophage activation, through attenuation of glucose uptake via the suppression of the membrane translocation of Glut1 and insulin signaling.
Humans are environmentally exposed not only to single endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) but to mixtures that affect their reproductive health. In reproductive tissues, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key targets of EDCs. Here, we analysed changes in the testis "miRNome" (and their biogenesis mechanism) in chronically exposed adult mice to a cocktail of five EDCs containing 0.3 mg/kg-body weight (BW)/day of each phthalate (DEHP, DBP, BBP) and 0.05 mg/kg-BW/day of each alkylphenol (NP, OP), from conception to adulthood. The testis "miRNome" was characterised using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Expression levels of genes involved in miRNA biogenesis were measured by RT-qPCR, as well as several physiological and cytological parameters. We found two up-regulated, and eight down-regulated miRNAs and thirty-six differentially expressed isomiRs along with an over-expression of Drosha, Adar and Zcchc11. A significant decrease of intratesticular estradiol but not testosterone was detected. Functional analysis showed altered spermatogenesis, germ cell apoptosis and negative correlation of miR-18a-5p with Nr1h2 involved in the deregulation of the steroidogenesis pathway. Here, we present the first association between miRNA/isomiRs deregulation, their mechanisms of biogenesis and histopathological and hormonal alterations in testes of adult mice exposed to a mixture of low-dose EDCs, which can play a role in male infertility.
The genomics era has brought along the completed sequencing of a large number of bird genomes that cover a broad range of the avian phylogenetic tree (&gt;30 orders), leading to major novel insights into avian biology and evolution. Among recent findings, the discovery that birds lack a large number of protein coding genes that are organized in highly conserved syntenic clusters in other vertebrates is very intriguing, given the physiological importance of many of these genes. A considerable number of them play prominent endocrine roles, suggesting that birds evolved compensatory genetic or physiological mechanisms that allowed them to survive and thrive in spite of these losses. While further studies are needed to establish the exact extent of avian gene losses, these findings point to birds as potentially highly relevant model organisms for exploring the genetic basis and possible therapeutic approaches for a wide range of endocrine functions and disorders.
Better efficacy for predicting the risk of transplantation rejection could be achieved by intergenic interactions among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with one SNP. In this study, we explored the forewarning function of interactions among SNPs in nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes. Thirty-eight polymorphisms in eight NER genes were genotyped by Sequenom MassARRAY platform, including XPA, XPC, DDB2, XPB (ERCC3), XPD (ERCC2), ERCC1, XPF (ERCC4), and XPG (ERCC5). The haplotype analysis suggested that XPA rs3176629-rs2808668 C-T and ERCC5 G-C-C-T and G-C-T-C (OR = 1.81, 7.72 and 3.46, respectively) increased the risk of transplantation rejection; while ERCC5 rs2094258-rs751402-rs2296147-rs1047768 A-C-T-T decreased the risk (OR = 0.35). Multiple logistic regression and multifactor dimensionality reduction (DMR) analyses consistently revealed intergenic interactions among ERCC2 rs50871, ERCC5 rs1047768, and XPC rs2228001 SNPs for the risk of transplantation rejection. Taken together, the interactions among XPC rs2228001, ERCC2 rs50871 and ERCC5 rs1047768 SNPs were associated with the risk of transplantation rejection.
To study associations of cerebrovascular metabolism genotypes and haplotypes with age at Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) onset and with neuropsychiatric symptoms according to each dementia stage.
Consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were assessed for age at dementia onset and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores according to Clinical Dementia Rating scores, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) haplotypes, angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) variants rs1800764 and rs4291, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor gene (LDLR) variants rs11669576 and rs5930, cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (CETP) variants I422V and TaqIB, and liver X receptor beta gene (NR1H2) polymorphism rs2695121.
Considering 201 patients, only APOE-ɛ4 carriers had earlier dementia onset in multiple correlations, as well as less apathy, more delusions, and more aberrant motor behavior. Both ACE polymorphisms were associated with less intense frontally mediated behaviors. Regarding LDLR variants, carriers of the A allele of rs11669576 had less anxiety and more aberrant motor behavior, whereas carriers of the A allele of rs5930 had less delusions, less anxiety, more apathy, and more irritability. CETP variants that included G alleles of I422V and TaqIB were mostly associated with less intense frontally mediated behaviors, while severely impaired carriers of the T allele of rs2695121 had more anxiety and more aberrant motor behavior.
Though only APOE haplotypes affected AD onset, cerebrovascular metabolism genotypes were associated with differences in several neuropsychiatric manifestations of AD.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) including LXRα and LXRβ are nuclear receptor transcription factors and play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism. It has been previously reported that mice lacking LXRβ but not LXRα develop a severe urine concentrating defect, likely via a central mechanism. Here we provide evidence that LXRβ regulates water homeostasis through increasing aquaporin 2 (AQP2) protein levels in renal collecting ducts. LXRβ-/- mice exhibited a reduced response to desmopressin (dDAVP) stimulation, suggesting that the diabetes insipidus phenotype is of both central and nephrogenic origin. AQP2 protein abundance in the renal inner medulla was significantly reduced in LXRβ-/- mice but with little change in AQP2 mRNA levels. In vitro studies showed that AQP2 protein levels were elevated upon LXR agonist treatment in both primary cultured mouse inner medullary duct cells (mIMCD) and the mIMCD3 cell line with stably expressed AQP2. In addition, LXR agonists including TO901317 and GW3965 failed to induce AQP2 gene transcription but diminished its protein ubiquitination in primary cultured mIMCD cells, thereby inhibiting its degradation. Moreover, LXR activation-induced AQP2 protein expression was abolished by the protease inhibitor MG132 and the ubiquitination-deficient AQP2 (K270R). Taken together, the present study demonstrates that activation of LXRβ increases AQP2 protein levels in the renal collecting ducts via a posttranscriptional mechanism. As such, LXRβ represents a key regulator of body water homeostasis.
ALS is a rapidly progressive, devastating neurodegenerative illness of adults that produces disabling weakness and spasticity arising from death of lower and upper motor neurons. No meaningful therapies exist to slow ALS progression, and molecular insights into pathogenesis and progression are sorely needed. In that context, we used high-depth, next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq, Illumina) to define gene network abnormalities in RNA samples depleted of rRNA and isolated from cervical spinal cord sections of 7 ALS and 8 CTL samples. We aligned &gt;50 million 2X150 bp paired-end sequences/sample to the hg19 human genome and applied three different algorithms (Cuffdiff2, DEseq2, EdgeR) for identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG's). Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified inflammatory processes as significantly elevated in our ALS samples, with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) found to be a major pathway regulator (IPA) and TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) as a major network "hub" gene (WGCNA). Using the oPOSSUM algorithm, we analyzed transcription factors (TF) controlling expression of the nine DEG/hub genes in the ALS samples and identified TF's involved in inflammation (NFkB, REL, NFkB1) and macrophage function (NR1H2::RXRA heterodimer). Transient expression in human iPSC-derived motor neurons of TNFAIP2 (also a DEG identified by all three algorithms) reduced cell viability and induced caspase 3/7 activation. Using high-density RNAseq, multiple algorithms for DEG identification, and an unsupervised gene co-expression network approach, we identified significant elevation of inflammatory processes in ALS spinal cord with TNF as a major regulatory molecule. Overexpression of the DEG TNFAIP2 in human motor neurons, the population most vulnerable to die in ALS, increased cell death and caspase 3/7 activation. We propose that therapies targeted to reduce inflammatory TNFα signaling may be helpful in ALS patients. 
An important step towards personalizing cancer treatment is to integrate heterogeneous evidences to catalog mutational hotspots that are biologically and therapeutically relevant and thus represent where targeted therapy would likely be beneficial. However, existing methods do not sufficiently delineate varying functionality of individual mutations within the same genes.
We observed a large discordancy of mutation rates across different mutation subtypes and tumor types, and nominated 702 hotspot mutations in 549 genes in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) by considering context specific mutation characteristics such as genes, cancer types, mutation rates, mutation subtypes and sequence contexts. We observed that hotspot mutations were highly prevalent in Non CpG-island C/G transition and transversion sequence contexts in 10 tumor types, and specific insertion hotspot mutations were enriched in breast cancer and deletion hotspot mutations in colorectal cancer. We found that the hotspot mutations nominated by our approach were significantly more conserved than non-hotspot mutations in the corresponding cancer genes. We also examined the biological significance and pharmacogenomics properties of these hotspot mutations using data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell-Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and found that 53 hotspot mutations are independently associated with diverse functional evidences in 1) mRNA and protein expression, 2) pathway activity, or 3) drug sensitivity and 82 were highly enriched in specific tumor types. We highlighted the distinct functional indications of hotspot mutations under different contexts and nominated novel hotspot mutations such as MAP3K4 A1199 deletion, NR1H2 Q175 insertion, and GATA3 P409 insertion as potential biomarkers or drug targets.
We identified a set of hotspot mutations across 17 tumor types by considering the background mutation rate variations among genes, tumor subtypes, mutation subtypes, and sequence contexts. We illustrated the common and distinct mutational signatures of hotspot mutations among different tumor types and investigated their variable functional relevance under different contexts, which could potentially serve as a resource for explicitly selecting targets for diagnosis, drug development, and patient management.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) rely on coregulator proteins to modulate transcription of target genes. NR coregulators can be broadly subdivided into coactivators which potentiate transcription and corepressors which silence gene expression. The prevailing view of coregulator action holds that in the absence of agonist the receptor interacts with a corepressor via the corepressor nuclear receptor (CoRNR, "corner") box motifs within the corepressor. Upon agonist binding, a conformational change in the receptor causes the shedding of corepressor and the binding of a coactivator which interacts with the receptor via NR boxes within the coregulator. This view was challenged with the discovery of RIP140 which acts as a NR corepressor in the presence of agonist and utilizes NR boxes. Since then a number of other corepressors of agonist-bound NRs have been discovered. Among them are LCoR, PRAME, REA, MTA1, NSD1, and COPR1 Although they exhibit a great diversity of structure, mechanism of repression and pathophysiological function, these corepressors frequently have one or more NR boxes and often recruit histone deacetylases to exert their repressive effects. This review highlights these more recently discovered corepressors and addresses their potential functions in transcription regulation, disease pharmacologic responses and xenobiotic metabolism.
Keratinocyte (KC) gene expression is regulated by members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily including retinoic acid receptors, retinoid X receptors (RAR and RXR, respectively), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR). In addition to ligand, NR transcriptional activity is controlled by interaction with proteins, collectively known as coregulators, which function as corepressors or coactivators. To improve our understanding of coregulators expressed in epidermis, we screened a KC cDNA library for PPARalpha-interacting proteins. The screen yielded previously unknown proteins including one we named COPR1, for comodulator of PPAR and RXR. COPR1 and its longer variant COPR2 target the AF-2 domains of NR but exhibit quantitative differences in their functional interactions with RAR, RXRalpha and PPAR. They decrease but do not completely repress the activity of RXRalpha and PPARalpha because of a proline-acid-rich autonomous activation domain. An NR box motif contributes to but is not solely responsible for functional and physical association with RXRalpha. The activation domain, their relatively small size (COPR1, 26.9 kDa; COPR2, 32.4 kDa), and strict dependence on AF-2 for interaction distinguish COPR1 and COPR2 from the SMRT/NCoR type of corepressor and may represent a means of control that dampens rather than completely represses NR-mediated gene expression.
To compare responses of a soil bacterium to Cu and Cd.
In minimal medium, Cd caused a dose-dependent growth stasis of logarithmic phase cells of Pseudomonas putida, strain KT2440, whereas Cu did not compromise growth up to 10 mg l(-1). Proteomics showed changes in accumulation of both membrane and soluble proteins by 6 h of treatment; increased Krebs cycle enzymes were apparent. Transcript analysis showed Cd- and Cu-induced different genes. Cd-induced genes encoding the transcriptional regulator CzrR2; an outer membrane protein associated with lipopolysaccharide stability, H1; two oxidative stress protective proteins and the P-type ATPase, CadA2, associated with Cd(2+) efflux. The genes most responsive to Cu encoded the regulator CopR1 and the outer membrane resistance protein regulated by CopR1, CopB1; a putative porin, PorD and the Cu-binding protein, PacZ or CopZ, and CopA2.
These findings support that a soil pseudomonad restricts internalization of the metals by using different sets of binding proteins and efflux pumps. Activation of mechanisms to protect against oxidative stress also was evident especially with Cd exposure.
The differential cellular responses to Cd and Cu suggest that risk assessment for Cd and Cu should be different.
Bacterial response to metals can require complex regulation. We report an overlapping regulation for copper and zinc resistance genes in the denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri RCH2, by three two-component regulatory proteins CopR1, CopR2 and CzcR. We conducted genome-wide evaluations to identify gene targets of two paralogous regulators, CopR1 and CopR2, annotated for copper signaling, and compared the results with the gene targets for CzcR, implicated in zinc signaling. We discovered that the CopRs and CzcR have largely common targets, and crossregulate a core set of P. stutzeri copper and zinc responsive genes. We established that this crossregulation is enabled by a conserved binding motif in the upstream regulatory regions of the target genes. The crossregulation is physiologically relevant as these regulators synergistically and antagonistically target multicopper oxidases, metal efflux and sequestration systems. CopR1 and CopR2 upregulate two cop operons encoding copper tolerance genes, while all three regulators downregulate a putative copper chaperone, Psest_1595. CzcR also upregulated the oprD gene and the CzcIABC Zn2+ efflux system, while CopR1 and CopR2 downregulated these genes. Our study suggests that crossregulation of copper and zinc homeostasis can be advantageous, and in P. stutzeri this is enabled by shared binding motifs for multiple response regulators.
ALY is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein which interacts with proteins such as TAP that are involved in export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, as well as with proteins that bind the T cell receptor alpha gene enhancer. ALY has also been shown to bind mRNA and to co-localize in the nucleus with components of a multiprotein postsplicing complex that is deposited 20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions. ALY has a conserved RNA binding domain (RBD) flanked by Gly-Arg rich N-terminal and C-terminal sequences. We determined the solution structure of the RBD homology region in ALY by nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The RBD motif in ALY has a characteristic beta(1)alpha(1)beta(2)-beta(3)alpha(2)beta(4) fold, consisting of a beta sheet composed of four antiparallel beta strands and two alpha helices that pack on one face of the beta sheet. As in other RBD structures, the beta sheet has an exposed face with hydrophobic and charged residues that could modulate interactions with other molecules. The loop that connects beta strands 2 and 3 is in intermediate motion in the NMR time scale, which is also characteristic of other RBDs. This loop presents side chains close to the exposed surface of the beta sheet and is a primary candidate site for intermolecular interactions. The structure of the conserved RBD of ALY provides insight into the nature of interactions involving this multifunctional protein.
Availability of the complete sequence of the human genome and sequence homology analysis has accelerated new protein discovery and clues to protein function. Protein-protein interaction cloning suggests multisubunit complexes and pathways. Here, we combine these molecular approaches with cultured cell colocalization analysis to suggest a novel complex and a pathway that integrate the mitochondrial location and the microtubular cytoskeleton with chromosome remodeling, apoptosis, and tumor suppression based on a novel leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) that copurified with the fibroblast growth factor receptor complex. One round of interaction cloning and sequence homology analysis defined a primary LRPPRC complex with novel subunits cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 2 (CECR2), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), and chromosome 19 open reading frames 5 (C19ORF5) but still of unknown function. Immuno, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag colocalization analyses revealed that LRPPRC appears in both cytosol and nuclei of cultured cells, colocalizes with mitochondria and beta-tubulin rather than with alpha-actin in the cytosol of interphase cells, and exhibits phase-dependent organization around separating chromosomes in mitotic cells. GFP-tagged CECR2B was strictly nuclear and colocalized with condensed DNA in apoptotic cells. GFP-tagged UXT and GFP-tagged C19ORF5 appeared in both cytosol and nuclei and colocalized with LRPPRC and beta-tubulin. Cells exhibiting nuclear C19ORF5 were apoptotic. Screening for interactive substrates with the primary LRPPRC substrates in the human liver complementary DNA library revealed that CECR2B interacted with chromatin-associated TFIID-associated protein TAFII30 and ribonucleic acid splicing factor SRP40, UXT bridged to CBP/p300-binding factor CITED2 and kinetochore-associated factor BUB3, and C19ORF5 complexed with mitochondria-associated NADH dehydrogenase I and cytochrome c oxidase I. C19ORF5 also interacted with RASSF1, providing a bridge to apoptosis and tumor suppression.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is an essential factor in endocrine proliferation and gene expression. Despite the fact that SF-1 expression is restricted to specialized cells within the endocrine system, the only identified regulatory factors of SF-1 are the ubiquitously expressed E-box proteins (upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2). Sequence examination of the SF-1 proximal promoter revealed a conserved site of AACAAAG (Sox-BS1), which matches exactly the defined consensus Sox protein binding element. Among the approximately 20 known members of the Sox gene family, we focused on Sox3, Sox8, and Sox9, based on their coexpression with SF-1 in the embryonic testis. Indeed, all three of these Sox proteins were capable of binding the proximal Sox-BS1 within the SF-1 promoter (-110 to -104), albeit with differing affinities. Of the three Sox proteins, Sox9 exhibited high-affinity binding to the Sox-BS1 element and consistently activated SF-1 promoter-reporter constructs. Mutating the Sox-BS1 attenuated SF-1 promoter activity in both embryonic and postnatal Sertoli cells, as well as in the adrenocortical cell line, Y1. Our findings, taken together with the overlapping expression profiles of Sox9 and SF-1, and the similar intersex phenotypes associated with both SOX9 and SF-1 human mutations, suggest that Sox9 up-regulates SF-1 and accounts partially for the sexually dimorphic expression pattern of SF-1 observed during male gonadal differentiation.
Human apoC-III (-890/+24) promoter activity is strongly activated by hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4 through its binding to the proximal (-87/-72) element B. This site overlaps the binding site for an activity that we identified as the ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factor (USF) (Ribeiro, A., Pastier, D., Kardassis, D., Chambaz, J., and Cardot, P. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1216-1225). In the present study, we characterized the relationship between USF and HNF-4 in the activation of human apoC-III transcription. Although USF and HNF-4 binding to element B is mutually exclusive, co-transfection experiments in HepG2 cells surprisingly showed a combined effect of USF and HNF-4 in the transactivation of the (-890/+24) apoC-III promoter. This effect only requires the proximal region (-99/+24) of the apoC-III promoter and depends neither on USF binding to its cognate site in element B nor on a USF-dependent facilitation of HNF-4 binding to its site. By contrast, we found by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and footprinting analysis two USF low affinity binding sites, located within the proximal promoter at positions -58/-31 (element II) and -19/-4 (element I), which are homologous to initiator-like element sequence. Co-transfection experiments in HepG2 cells show that a mutation in element II reduces 2-fold the USF transactivation effect on the proximal promoter of apoC-III and that a mutation in element I inhibits the combined effect of USF and HNF-4. In conclusion, these initiator-like elements are directly involved in the transactivation of the apoC-III promoter by USF and are necessary to the combined effect between USF and HNF-4 for the apoC-III transcription.
Locus control regions (LCRs) refer to cis-acting elements composed of several DNase I hypersensitive sites, which synergize to protect transgenes from integration-site dependent effects in a tissue-specific manner. LCRs have been identified in many immunologically important gene loci, including one between the TCRdelta/TCRalpha gene segments and the ubiquitously expressed Dad1 gene. Expression of a transgene under the control of all the LCR elements is T cell specific. However, a subfragment of this LCR is functional in a wide variety of tissues. How a ubiquitously active element can participate in tissue-restricted LCR activity is not clear. In this study, we localize the ubiquitously active sequences of the TCR-alpha LCR to an 800-bp region containing a prominent DNase hypersensitive site. In isolation, the activity in this region suppresses position effect transgene silencing in many tissues. A combination of in vivo footprint examination of this element in widely active transgene and EMSAs revealed tissue-unrestricted factor occupancy patterns and binding of several ubiquitously expressed transcription factors. In contrast, tissue-specific, differential protein occupancies at this element were observed in the endogenous locus or full-length LCR transgene. We identified tissue-restricted AML-1 and Elf-1 as proteins that potentially act via this element. These data demonstrate that a widely active LCR module can synergize with other LCR components to produce tissue-specific LCR activity through differential protein occupancy and function and provide evidence to support a role for this LCR module in the regulation of both TCR and Dad1 genes.
The Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed and control a wide range of cellular responses, including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and immunity. Here, we investigated the function of the NF-kappaB upstream regulator IkappaB kinase 2/beta (IKK2) in apoptosis regulation in the normal physiological setting of regressing mammary gland. Conditional deletion of the gene encoding IKK2 resulted, surprisingly, in delayed apoptosis and remodelling, and abrogation of caspase 3 cleavage. This failure to induce involution was associated with reduced expression, within 24 hours of involution, of the death receptor (DR) ligand TNF and its receptor TNFR1, which are known NF-kappaB targets. This was associated with elevated levels of active AKT and phosphorylated FOXO3a. Furthermore, we show that expression of TWEAK, another DR ligand, is dramatically downregulated, even in heterozygous IKK2 mammary glands. Unlike other DR ligands, the TWEAK promoter has six consensus FOXO-binding sites, further suggesting that it is differentially regulated. Interestingly, a cleaved form of TWEAK is upregulated during involution. This unexpected function of the IKK2/NF-kappaB pathway as a regulator of TWEAK expression and inducer of apoptosis has significant consequences for future therapeutic approaches for cancer and inflammatory diseases.
Through its transcriptional activities, the proto-oncoprotein c-Jun can regulate cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation. We have established a novel yeast assay that screens for repressors of c-Jun transcriptional activity. This screen led to the identification of a ubiquitously expressed novel RING zinc finger protein, termed Makorin RING zinc finger protein 1 (MKRN1), recently shown to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of MKRN1 in mammalian cells inhibited the transcriptional activities of not only c-Jun, but also the nuclear receptors, the androgen receptor, and the retinoic acid receptors. Truncation analysis indicates that both the amino and carboxy termini are required for this transrepression activity. Surprisingly, when fused to the heterologous DNAbinding domain of GAL4, MKRN1 activates, rather than inhibits, a GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid. In addition, truncation of either the amino- or carboxy-terminal half of MKRN1 disrupts its transactivation activity, the same observation that was made on its transrepression activity. These results demonstrate that MKRN1 has transcriptional activity and suggest that its transrepression and transactivation functions are mediated by the same mechanism. Interestingly, disruption of MKRN1's ubiquitin ligase activity does not affect its inhibitory transcriptional activity. Thus, MKRN1 may represent a nuclear protein with multiple nuclear functions, including regulating RNA polymerase II-catalyzed transcription.
Various studies have shown that the insulin receptor (IR) is increased in most human breast cancers, and both ligand-dependent malignant transformation and increased cell growth occur in cultured breast cells overexpressing the IR. However, although numerous in vivo and in vitro observations have indicated an important contributory role for the IR in breast cancer cell biology, the molecular mechanisms accounting for increased IR expression in breast tumors have not previously been elucidated. Herein, we did immunoblot analyses of nuclear protein from cultured breast cancer cells and normal and tumoral tissues from breast cancer patients combined with promoter studies by using a series of human wild-type and mutant IR promoter constructs. We provide evidence that IR overexpression in breast cancer is dependent on the assembly of a transcriptionally active multiprotein-DNA complex, which includes the high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) protein, the developmentally regulated activator protein-2 (AP-2) transcription factor and the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1. In cultured breast cancer cells and human breast cancer specimens, the expression of AP-2 was significantly higher than that observed in cells and tissues derived from normal breast, and this overexpression paralleled the increase in IR expression. However, AP-2 DNA-binding activity was undetectable with the IR gene promoter, suggesting that transactivation of this gene by AP-2 might occur indirectly through physical and functional cooperation with HMGA1 and Sp1. Our findings support this hypothesis and suggest that in affected individuals, hyperactivation of the AP-2 gene through the overexpression of IR may play a key role in breast carcinogenesis.
Human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) is an ubiquitously expressed protein that plays an important role in the detoxification and xenobiotics metabolism. It has been shown that GSTP1-1 interacts with c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and suppresses its activity. Here, we report a novel function of GSTP1-1 in regulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-triggered signaling. The present experiments showed that GSTP1-1 physically associated with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of GSTP1-1 inhibited TRAF2-induced activation of both JNK and p38 but not of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Glutathione S-transferase P1-1 also attenuated TRAF2-enhanced apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) autophosphorylation and inhibited TRAF2-ASK1-induced cell apoptosis by suppressing the interaction of TRAF2 and ASK1. Conversely, silencing of GSTP1-1 expression through RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increase of TNF-alpha-dependent TRAF2-ASK1 association followed by hyper-activation of ASK1 and JNK. A mutant GSTP1-1 lacking TRAF domain-binding motif exhibited a significant decline of capacity to bind TRAF2 and block TRAF2-ASK1 signaling compared with the wild type of GSTP1-1. Moreover, the glutathione-conjugating activity of GSTP1-1 was not involved in the regulation of TRAF2 signaling. These findings indicate that GSTP1-1 plays an important regulatory role in TNF-alpha-induced signaling by forming ligand-binding interactions with TRAF2, which provides a new insight for analysing the protective effects of GSTP1-1 in tumor cells.
Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed mammalian transcription factors that activate or repress the expression of a variety of genes and are thought to compete for the same DNA binding site. We used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and image deconvolution to show that Sp1 and Sp3 are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains in human breast and ovarian cells. Domains of Sp1 and Sp3 infrequently associate with sites of transcription. Sp3 partitions with the tightly bound nuclear protein fraction of hormone responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, whereas only a subpopulation of Sp1 is found in that fraction. Both Sp1 and Sp3 are bound to the nuclear matrix, and the nuclear matrix-associated sites of Sp1 and Sp3 are different. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 associate with histone deacetylases 1 and 2 and with the estrogen receptor alpha, albeit at low frequencies in MCF-7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays revealed that although both Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the estrogen-responsive trefoil factor 1 promoter in MCF-7 cells, they do not occupy the same promoter. Our results demonstrate the different features of Sp1 and Sp3, providing further evidence that Sp3 is not a functional equivalent of Sp1.
At parturition, dairy cows experience a 70% reduction in plasma IGF-I. This reduction coincides with decreased abundance of GHR1A, the liver-specific transcript of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene, suggesting impaired growth hormone-dependent synthesis of IGF-I. It is not immediately obvious that the periparturient reduction in GHR1A is sufficient to reduce hepatic GHR abundance. This is because approximately 50% of total GHR mRNA abundance in prepartum liver is accounted for by ubiquitously expressed transcripts which remain collectively unchanged at parturition. In addition, the possibility that parturition alters GHR expression in other growth hormone target tissue has not been examined. To address these questions, we measured GHR gene expression and GHR protein in liver and skeletal muscle of four dairy cows on days -35,+3 and+56 (relative to parturition on day 0). Hepatic GHR abundance and GHR1A transcripts were lower on day+3 than on day -35 and returned to late pregnancy value by day+56. Additional studies in two other groups of cows indicated that the hepatic levels of the GHR protein recovered substantially within 10 days after parturition. These changes occurred without variation in the abundance of HNF4, a liver-enriched transcription factor activating the promoter responsible for GHR1A synthesis. In contrast to liver, levels of GHR gene expression and GHR protein were identical on days -35,+3 and+56 in skeletal muscle. These data suggest a role for the GHR in regulating tissue-specific changes in growth hormone responsiveness in periparturient dairy cows.
Prothrombin is a key component in blood coagulation. Overexpression of prothrombin leads to an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Therefore, the study of the transcriptional regulation of the prothrombin gene may help to identify mechanisms of overexpression.
The aim of our study was to localize the regions within the prothrombin enhancer responsible for its activity, to identify the proteins binding to these regions, and to establish their functional importance.
We constructed a set of prothrombin promoter 5' deletion constructs containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, which were transiently transfected in HepG2, HuH7 and HeLa cells. Putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The functional importance of each TF binding site was evaluated by site directed mutagenesis and transient transfection of the mutant constructs.
We confirmed the major contribution of the enhancer region to the transcriptional activity of the prothrombin promoter. Analysis of this region revealed putative binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF4, HNF3-beta and specificity protein(Sp)1. We identified six different TFs binding to three evolutionary conserved sites in the enhancer: HNF4-alpha (site 1), HNF1-alpha, HNF3-beta and an as yet unidentified TF (site 2) and the ubiquitously expressed TFs Sp1 and Sp3 (site 3). Mutagenesis studies showed that loss of binding of HNF3-beta resulted in a considerable decrease of enhancer activity, whereas loss of HNF4-alpha or Sp1/Sp3 resulted in milder reductions.
The prothrombin enhancer plays a major role in regulation of prothrombin expression. Six different TFs are able to bind to this region. At least three of these TFs, HNF4-alpha, HNF3-beta and Sp1/Sp3, are important in regulation of prothrombin expression.
Aromatic hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) is an ubiquitously expressed protein that contains basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-AhR-Arnt-Sim (PAS) motifs. Other bHLH-PAS proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediate hypoxia- and dioxin-signal pathway, respectively. Arnt has been identified as a heterodimerization partner for AhR. AhR/Arnt heterodimer binds the regulatory region of xenobiotic-induced genes and activates their transcription. Here, in vivo results provide evidence that Arnt is involved in not only xenobiotic- but also hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation. In hypoxic condition, Arnt dimerizes with HIF-1alpha to make HIF-1alpha/Arnt heterodimer which is able to bind hypoxia-responsive DNA elements. The HIF-1alpha/Arnt heterodimer functions as a transactivator for hypoxia-inducible genes. Given that the expression of Arnt is limited, HIF-1alpha may compete with AhR for recruiting Arnt as a heteromeric partner. Consistent with this idea, the results indicate that the hypoxic activation of HIF-1alpha reduces dioxin-induced AhR's function on the dioxin-responsive reporter gene and the endogenous gene.
