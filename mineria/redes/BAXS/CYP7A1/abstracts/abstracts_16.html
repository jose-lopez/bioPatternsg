In particular, there is evidence suggesting that the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) is an important factor in the regulation of sebocyte lipogenesis.
To determine the role of PPARs, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and other orphan nuclear hormone receptors in sebaceous gland function in vitro by investigating the biochemical effects of appropriate ligands, and by establishing the RNA and protein expression patterns of a number of nuclear receptors in sebaceous glands ex vivo.
Human chest sebaceous glands were maintained in vitro as freshly isolated and as 7-day cultured whole organs. We then studied the effects of appropriate ligands on the glandular rates of lipogenesis and DNA synthesis, as well as determining the mRNA (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and protein expression patterns (immunohistochemistry/immunoblotting) of the nuclear hormone receptors of interest.
PPAR ligands, but not FXR ligands, inhibited sebaceous lipogenesis, in particular the PPARalpha ligands LY 171883 and WY 14643, and the PPARgamma ligands BRL 49653 and 15-deoxy-Delta-12,14-prostaglandin J(2). We detected RNA expression of PPARalpha, PPARbeta, PPARgamma, retinoid X receptor alpha, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and pregnane X receptor but not FXR in freshly isolated and 7-day maintained sebaceous glands. PPARalpha, PPARbeta, PPARgamma and LXRalpha protein were detected in nuclear extracts of sebaceous glands.
We conclude that activation of nuclear hormone receptors, in particular activation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma, can regulate lipogenesis in human sebaceous glands. As suppression of sebum secretion is associated with reduced acne activity, the nuclear hormone receptors involved may open new avenues in the development of novel acne treatments.
High-throughput screening (HTS) has grown rapidly in the past decade, with many advances in new assay formats, detection technologies, and laboratory automation. Recently, several studies have shown that the choice of assay technology used for the screening process is particularly important and can yield quite different primary screening outcomes. However, because the screening assays in these previous studies were performed in a single-point determination, it is not clear to what extent the difference observed in the screening results between different assay technologies is attributable to inherent assay variability and day-to-day measurement variation. To address this question, a nuclear receptor coactivator recruitment assay was carried out in 2 different assay formats, namely, AlphaScreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, which probed the same biochemical binding events but with different detection technologies. For each assay format, 4 independent screening runs in a typical HTS setting were completed to evaluate the run-to-run screening variability. These multiple tests with 2 assay formats allow an unambiguous comparison between the discrepancies of different assay formats and the effects of the variability of assay and screening measurements on the screening outcomes. The results provide further support that the choice of assay format or technology is a critical factor in HTS assay development.
The nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma exert counter-regulatory effects on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and protect against liver fibrosis development in rodents. Here, we investigated whether FXR ligands regulate PPARgamma expression in HSCs and models of liver fibrosis induced in rats by porcine serum and carbon tetrachloride administration and bile duct ligation. Our results demonstrate that HSCs trans-differentiation associated with suppression of PPARgamma mRNA expression, whereas FXR mRNA was unchanged. Exposure of cells to natural and synthetic ligands of FXR, including 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA), a synthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid, reversed this effect and increased PPARgamma mRNA by approximately 40-fold. Submaximally effective concentrations of FXR and PPARgamma ligands were additive in inhibiting alpha1(I) collagen mRNA accumulation induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1. Administration of 6-ECDCA in rats rendered cirrhotic by porcine serum and carbon tetrachloride administration or bile duct ligation reverted down-regulation of PPARgamma mRNA expression in HSCs. Cotreatment with 6-ECDCA potentiates the antifibrotic activity of rosiglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand, in the porcine serum model as measured by morphometric analysis of liver collagen content, hydroxyproline, and liver expression of alpha1(I) collagen mRNA, alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, TGFbeta1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 1 and 2, whereas it enhanced the expression of PPARgamma and uncoupling protein 2, a PPARgamma-regulated gene, by 2-fold. In conclusion, by using an in vitro and in vivo approach, we demonstrated that FXR ligands up-regulate PPARgamma mRNA in HSCs and in rodent models of liver fibrosis. A FXR-PPARgamma cascade exerts counter-regulatory effects in HSCs activation.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is expressed by and regulates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In the present study, we investigated whether 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA or INT-747), a semisynthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), modulates tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor (TIMP)-1 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 expression/activity in HSCs and in the liver of rats rendered cirrhotic by 4-week administration of CCl(4). Exposure of HSCs to FXR ligands increases small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA by 3-fold and reduces basal and thrombin-stimulated expression of alpha1(I)collagen, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 by approximately 60 to 70%, whereas it increased matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 activity by 2-fold. In coimmunoprecipitation, electromobility shift, and transactivation experiments, FXR activation/overexpression caused a SHP-dependent inhibition of JunD binding to its consensus element in the TIMP-1 promoter. Inhibition of TIMP-1 expression by SHP overexpression enhanced the sensitivity of HSCs to proapoptogenic stimuli. Administration of 3 mg/kg 6-ECDCA, but not 15 mg/kg ursodeoxycholic acid, resulted in early (3-5-day) induction of SHP and prevention of early up-regulation of TIMP-1 mRNA induced by CCl(4). In the prevention protocol, 4-week administration of 6-ECDCA reduced alpha1(I)collagen, alpha-SMA, and TIMP-1 mRNA by 60 to 80%, whereas it increased MMP-2 activity by 5-fold. In the resolution protocol, administration of 3 mg/kg 6-ECDCA promoted liver fibrosis resolution and increased the apoptosis of nonparenchyma liver cells. By demonstrating that a FXR-SHP regulatory cascade promotes the development of a quiescent phenotype and increases apoptosis of HSCs, this study establishes that FXR ligands may be beneficial in treatment of liver fibrosis.
The relationship between BA (bile acid) secretion (measured by GC-MS) and the expression of genes (measured by reverse transcription real-time PCR) involved in liver BA transport and metabolism was investigated at 20 and 32 weeks during rat hepatocarcinogenesis. A progressive loss of mRNA for transporters (more marked for Ntcp, Bsep and Mrp2 than for Oatp1/Oatp1a1, Oatp2/Oatp1a4 and Oatp4/Oatp1b2) was found. The mRNA levels of Cyp7a1 and the nuclear receptors FXR (farnesoid X receptor), SHP (small heterodimer partner) and FTF (alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor) were not modified, whereas those of Cyp8b1 were enhanced and those of Cyp27 were reduced. Biliary secretion of CA (cholic acid) remained unchanged, whereas that of CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) and other non-C(12)-hydroxylated BAs was diminished. The re-appearance of 'flat-BAs' (mainly allo-BAs at 20 weeks and Delta(4)-unsaturated-BAs at 32 weeks) probably reflects the progressive decrease observed in the expression of 3-oxo-Delta(4)-steroid 5beta-reductase, together with the maintenance of steroid 5alpha-reductase type I. A significant correlation between the 5alpha-reductase/5beta-reductase ratio and bile output of 'flat-BAs' was found. In conclusion, during rat hepatocarcinogenesis, the expression of transporters/enzymes responsible for BA homoeostasis is changed due to mechanisms other than those controlled by FXR/SHP/FTF. These modifications result in the re-appearance of 'flat-BAs', together with an increased CA/CDCA ratio in bile.
Previous studies have demonstrated a dramatic induction of inflammatory gene expression in livers from mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet containing cholate after 3-5 wk. To determine the contribution of cholate in mediating these inductions, C57BL/6 mice were fed a chow diet supplemented with increasing concentrations of cholic acid (CA) for 5 days. A dose-dependent induction in the hepatic levels of TNF-alpha, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and SAA-2 mRNA were observed. As positive controls, a dose-dependent repression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and a dose-dependent induction of small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression were also observed, suggesting that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was activated. In addition, ICAM-1 and SHP mRNA levels were also induced in primary human hepatocytes when treated with chenodeoxycholic acid or GW4064, a FXR-selective agonist. The involvement of FXR in CA-induced inflammatory gene expression was further investigated in the human hepatic cell line HepG2. Both ICAM-1 and SHP expression were induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner by treatment with the FXR-selective agonist GW4064. Moreover, the induction of ICAM-1 by GW4064 was inhibited by the FXR antagonist guggulsterone or with transfection of FXR siRNA. Finally, the activity of FXR was mapped to a retinoic acid response element (RARE) site containing an imbedded farnesoid X response element (FXRE) on the human ICAM-1 promoter and FXR and retinoid X receptor were demonstrated to bind to this site. Finally, FXR-mediated activation of ICAM-1 could be further enhanced by TNF-alpha cotreatment in hepatocytes, suggesting a potential cooperation between cytokine and bile acid-signaling pathways during hepatic inflammatory events.
Peroxisomal beta-oxidation is an essential step in bile acid synthesis, since it is required for shortening of C27-bile acid intermediates to produce mature C24-bile acids. D-Bifunctional protein (DBP) is responsible for the second and third step of this beta-oxidation process. However, both patients and mice with a DBP deficiency still produce C24-bile acids, although C27-intermediates accumulate. An alternative pathway for bile acid biosynthesis involving the peroxisomal L-bifunctional protein (LBP) has been proposed. We investigated the role of LBP and DBP in bile acid synthesis by analyzing bile acids in bile, liver, and plasma from LBP, DBP, and LBP:DBP double knock-out mice. Bile acid biosynthesis, estimated by the ratio of C27/C24-bile acids, was more severely affected in double knock-out mice as compared with DBP-/- mice but was normal in LBP-/- mice. Unexpectedly, trihydroxycholestanoyl-CoA oxidase was inactive in double knock-out mice due to a peroxisomal import defect, preventing us from drawing any firm conclusion about the potential role of LBP in an alternative bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, the immature C27-bile acids in DBP and double knock-out mice remained unconjugated in juvenile mice, whereas they occurred as taurine conjugates after weaning, probably contributing to the minimal weight gain of the mice during the lactation period. This correlated with a marked induction of bile acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase expression and enzyme activity between postnatal days 10 and 21, whereas the bile acyl-CoA synthetases increased gradually with age. The nuclear receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha, farnesoid X receptor, and peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha did not appear to be involved in the up-regulation of the transferase.
Human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase or (HUMAN)SULT2A1 catalyzes the sulfonation of procarcinogen xenobiotics, hydroxysteroids, and bile acids and plays a dynamic role in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. The treatment of primary cultured human hepatocytes with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha)-activating concentration of ciprofibrate (10(-) (4) M) increased (HUMAN)SULT2A1 mRNA, immunoreactive protein, and enzymatic activity levels by approximately 2-fold. By contrast, expression of (RAT)SULT2A3, the rat counterpart to (HUMAN)SULT2A1, was induced by treatment of primary hepatocyte cultures with an activator of the pregnane X receptor, but not PPARalpha. In HepG2 cells, transient transfection analyses of luciferase reporter constructs containing upstream regions of the (HUMAN)SULT2A1 gene implicated a candidate peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) at nucleotides (nt) -5949 to -5929 relative to the transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies confirmed that this distal PPRE (dPPRE), a direct repeat nuclear receptor motif containing one intervening nt, represented a functional PPRE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the (HUMAN)SULT2A1 dPPRE was also a functional element in the context of the human genome. These data support a major role for the PPARalpha transcription factor in the regulation of hepatic (HUMAN)SULT2A1. Results also indicate that important species differences govern the transactivation of SULT2A gene transcription by nuclear receptors.
The regulation of the rabbit apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) was studied both in vivo and in vitro. New Zealand White rabbits were fed 0.5% deoxycholic acid (DCA) or SC-435, a competitive ASBT inhibitor, for 1 wk. In DCA-fed rabbits, ASBT expression was repressed, associated with activated FXR, and evidenced by increased ileal short heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA. Feeding SC-435 to the rabbits blocked bile acid absorption, decreased SHP mRNA, and increased ASBT expression. A 1.9-kb rabbit ASBT 5'-flanking region (promoter) was cloned, and a cis-acting element for alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) was identified (-1166/-1158). The effects of transcriptional factors and different bile acids on the rabbit ASBT promoter were studied in Caco-2 cells. FTF stimulated the rabbit ASBT promoter activity fourfold but not after the FTF binding site was deleted from the promoter. Increasing the SHP protein notably inhibited FTF-dependent trans-activation of rabbit ASBT. Adding hydrophobic bile acids deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and cholic acid, activating ligands for FXR, inhibited rabbit ASBT promoter activity in Caco-2 cells, but this inhibitory effect was abolished after the FTF binding site was deleted. Ursodeoxycholic acid and ursocholic acid, nonactivating ligands for FXR, did not repress ASBT promoter activity. Thus the rabbit ASBT promoter is negative-feedback regulated by bile acids via a functional FTF binding site. Only FXR-activating ligands can downregulate rabbit ASBT expression through the regulatory cascade FXR-SHP-FTF.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) is an intracellular bile acid-sensing transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of synthesis and transport of bile acids as well as lipid metabolism. Although the reciprocal relationship between bile acid and triglyceride levels is well known, the mechanism underlying this link is not clearly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that FXR regulates the expression of at least two secreted factors, complement component C3 and FGF15, the rat ortholog of FGF19, known to influence lipid metabolism. The analysis of the human complement C3 gene reveals the presence of functional FXR response elements in the proximal promoter of C3. Furthermore, rats given a single dose of an FXR agonist exhibit an increase in the plasma concentration of complement C3 protein. These studies demonstrate a mechanism by which FXR, a nuclear receptor with a limited tissue expression pattern, regulates secretion of factors that ultimately can affect lipid metabolism in an endocrine or paracrine manner.
Fructose is a key dietary factor in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here we investigated whether WAY-362450 (WAY), a potent synthetic and orally active FXR agonist, protects against fructose-induced steatosis and the underlying mechanisms. C57BL/6J mice, fed 30% fructose for 8 weeks, were treated with or without WAY, 30 mg/kg, for 20 days. The elevation of serum and hepatic triglyceride in mice fed 30% fructose was reversed by WAY treatment. Histologically, WAY significantly reduced triglyceride accumulation in liver, attenuated microphage infiltration and protected the junction integrity in intestine. Moreover, WAY remarkably decreased portal endotoxin level, and lowered serum TNFŒ± concentration. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NAFLD model, WAY attenuated serum TNFŒ± level. Moreover, WAY suppressed LPS-induced expression of hepatic lipid droplet protein adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), down-regulation of it in mice fed 30% fructose. Furthermore, WAY repressed lipid accumulation and ADRP expression in a dose-dependent manner in palmitic acid (PA)-treated HepG2 and Huh7 cells. WAY suppressed TNFŒ±-induced ADRP up-regulation via competing with AP-1 for ADRP promoter binding region. Together, our findings suggest that WAY, an FXR agonist, attenuates liver steatosis through multiple mechanisms critically involved in the development of hepatosteatosis, and represents a candidate for NAFLD treatment.
Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) is a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor that positively regulates transcription of target genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. In the present study, we have investigated a possible involvement of SREBP-2 in human intestinal expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19, which is an endocrine hormone involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Overexpression of constitutively active SREBP-2 decreased FGF19 mRNA levels in human colon-derived LS174T cells. In reporter assays, active SREBP-2 overexpression suppressed GW4064/FXR-mediated increase in reporter activities in regions containing the IR-1 motif (+848 to +5200) in the FGF19 gene. The suppressive effect disappeared in reporter activities in the region containing the IR-1 motif when the mutation was introduced into the IR-1 motif. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, binding of the FXR/retinoid X receptor Œ± heterodimer to the IR-1 motif was attenuated by adding active SREBP-2, but SREBP-2 binding to the IR-1 motif was not observed. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, specific binding of FXR to the IR-1-containing region of the FGF19 gene (+3214 to +3404) was increased in LS174T cells by treatment with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. Specific binding of SREBP-2 to FXR was observed in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. These results suggest that SREBP-2 negatively regulates the FXR-mediated transcriptional activation of the FGF19 gene in human intestinal cells. 
The aged liver is more sensitive to the drug treatments and has a high probability of developing liver disorders such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. Here we present mechanisms underlying age-associated severe liver injury and acceleration of liver proliferation after CCl4 treatments. We have examined liver response to CCl4 treatments using old WT mice and young C/EBPŒ±-S193D knockin mice, which express an aged-like isoform of C/EBPŒ±. Both animal models have altered chromatin structure as well as increased liver injury and proliferation after acute CCl4 treatments. We found that these age-related changes are associated with the repression of key regulators of liver biology: C/EBPŒ±, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT). In quiescent livers of old WT and young S193D mice, the inhibition of TERT is mediated by HDAC1-C/EBPŒ± complexes. After CCl4 treatments, TERT, C/EBPŒ± and FXR are repressed by different mechanisms. These mechanisms include the increase of a dominant negative isoform, C/EBPŒ≤-LIP, and subsequent repression of C/EBPŒ±, FXR, and TERT promoters. C/EBPŒ≤-LIP also disrupts Rb-E2F1 complexes in C/EBPŒ±-S193D mice after CCl4 treatments. To examine if these alterations are involved in drug-mediated liver diseases, we performed chronic treatments of mice with CCl4. We found that C/EBPŒ±-S193D mice developed fibrosis much more rapidly than WT mice. Thus, our data show that the age-associated alterations of C/EBP proteins create favorable conditions for the increased liver proliferation after CCl4 treatments and for development of drug-mediated liver diseases. 
To determine whether down-regulation of transcription factor signaling during pregnancy disrupts the induction of efflux transporters in type I diabetic mice.
Type I diabetes was induced in female C57BL/6 mice with multiple low dose intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ) at least 2 weeks prior to mating with normoglycemic male mice. On gestation day 14, livers were collected from vehicle- and STZ-treated non-pregnant and pregnant mice for quantification of efflux transporter and transcription factor signaling.
STZ treatment up-regulated expression of Mrp1-5, Mdr1, Abcg5, Abcg8, Bcrp, and Bsep mRNA and/or protein in the livers of non-pregnant mice. Interestingly, little to no change in transporter expression was observed in STZ-treated pregnant mice compared to vehicle- and STZ-treated non-pregnant mice.
This study demonstrates the opposing regulation of hepatobiliary efflux transporters in response to diabetes and pregnancy and points to PPARŒ≥, Nrf2, and FXR as candidate pathways underlying the differential expression of transporters.
We have previously shown that expression of the transcription factor ARNT/HIF1beta is reduced in islets of humans with type 2 diabetes. We have now found that ARNT is also reduced in livers of diabetics. To study the functional effect of its reduction, we created mice with liver-specific ablation (L-ARNT KO) using ARNT loxP mice and adenoviral-mediated delivery of Cre. L-ARNT KO mice had normal blood glucose but increased fed insulin levels. These mice also exhibited features of type 2 diabetes with increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased lipogenic gene expression, and low serum beta-hydroxybutyrate. These effects appear to be secondary to increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and a reduction in phosphorylation of AMPK without changes in the expression of enzymes in ketogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, or FGF21. These results demonstrate that a deficiency of ARNT action in the liver, coupled with that in beta cells, could contribute to the metabolic phenotype of human type 2 diabetes.
C-reactive protein (CRP), a human acute-phase protein, is a risk factor for future cardiovascular events and exerts direct pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic properties. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, plays an essential role in the regulation of enterohepatic circulation and lipid homeostasis. In this study, we report that two synthetic FXR agonists, WAY-362450 and GW4064, suppressed interleukin-6-induced CRP expression in human Hep3B hepatoma cells. Knockdown of FXR by short interfering RNA attenuated the inhibitory effect of the FXR agonists and also increased the ability of interleukin-6 to induce CRP production. Furthermore, treatment of wild type C57BL/6 mice with the FXR agonist, WAY-362450, attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced serum amyloid P component and serum amyloid A3 mRNA levels in the liver, whereas no effect was observed in FXR knockout mice. These data provide new evidence for direct anti-inflammatory properties of FXR.
We present the performance of HADDOCK, our information-driven docking software, in the second edition of the D3R Grand Challenge. In this blind experiment, participants were requested to predict the structures and binding affinities of complexes between the Farnesoid X nuclear receptor and 102 different ligands. The models obtained in Stage1 with HADDOCK and ligand-specific protocol show an average ligand RMSD of 5.1¬†√Ö from the crystal structure. Only 6/35 targets were within 2.5¬†√Ö RMSD from the reference, which prompted us to investigate the limiting factors and revise our protocol for Stage2. The choice of the receptor conformation appeared to have the strongest influence on the results. Our Stage2 models were of higher quality (13 out of 35 were within 2.5¬†√Ö), with an average RMSD of 4.1¬†√Ö. The docking protocol was applied to all 102 ligands to generate poses for binding affinity prediction. We developed a modified version of our contact-based binding affinity predictor PRODIGY, using the number of interatomic contacts classified by their type and the intermolecular electrostatic energy. This simple structure-based binding affinity predictor shows a Kendall's Tau correlation of 0.37 in ranking the ligands (7th best out of 77 methods, 5th/25 groups). Those results were obtained from the average prediction over the top10 poses, irrespective of their similarity/correctness, underscoring the robustness of our simple predictor. This results in an enrichment factor of 2.5 compared to a random predictor for ranking ligands within the top 25%, making it a promising approach to identify lead compounds in virtual screening.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important target for drug discovery. Small molecules induce a conformational change in FXR that modulates its binding to co-regulators, thus resulting in distinct FXR functional profiles. However, the mechanisms for selectively recruiting co-regulators by FXR remain elusive, partly because of the lack of FXR-selective modulators. We report the identification of two natural terpenoids, tschimgine and feroline, as novel FXR modulators. Remarkably, their crystal structures uncovered a secondary binding pocket important for ligand binding. Further, tschimgine or feroline induced dynamic conformational changes in the activation function‚ÄÖ2 (AF-2) surface, thus leading to differential co-regulator recruiting profiles, modulated by both hydrophobic and selective hydrogen-bond interactions unique to specific co-regulators. Our findings thus provide a novel structure template for optimization for FXR-selective modulators of clinical value.
The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) is the dominant carrier of organic cationic drugs and some positively charged endogenous compounds into hepatocytes. OCT1 has unique expression pattern. It has the highest expression among drug transporters in normal human hepatocytes with large interindividual variability, but it has negligible expression in other tissues or their tumors. Nowadays, it is clear that the regulation of SLC22A1 gene encoding OCT1 transporter is rather complex and that transactivation with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4Œ± (HNF4Œ±) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPs) transcription factors as well as epigenetic regulation contribute to its unique hepatocyte-specific expression pattern. Unfortunately, species- and tissue-specific regulation of OCT1 and its orthologs as well as significant down-regulation in most immortalized cell lines hamper the study of SLC22A1 gene regulation. In the current review, we summarize our current understanding of human OCT1 transporter hepatic gene regulation and we propose potential post-transcriptional regulation by predicted miRNAs. We also discuss in detail recent findings on indirect regulation of the transporter via farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucocorticoid receptor and pregnane X (PXR) receptor, which point out to potential novel mechanisms of xenobiotic-transporting and drug-metabolizing proteins regulation in the human liver as well as to potentially novel drug-drug interaction mechanisms. We also propose that comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of SLC22A1 gene regulation could direct research for other drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes highly expressed in hepatocytes and controlled by HNF4Œ± or other liver-enriched transcription factors.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common health problem worldwide, characterized by aberrant accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes. Inhibition of lipid accumulation has been well recognized as a promising strategy for ALD. Previous studies showed that curcumin has potential effect on ALD by regulating oxidative stress and ethanol metabolism. However, the effects of curcumin on lipid accumulation and its mechanism remain unclear. Recent researches have indicated that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) have excellent effects on reducing lipid deposition. This study demonstrated that curcumin alleviated ethanol-induced liver injury by ameliorating activities of serum marker enzymes and inflammation. Moreover, curcumin alleviated the symptom of hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis via modulating the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha as well as the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. Additionally, curcumin induced the expression of Nrf2 and FXR in liver, strongly implying close relationship between inhibitory effect of curcumin on hepatic steatosis and the above two genes. The following in vitro experiments further verified the protective effects of curcumin against hepatotoxicity and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes induced by ethanol. Gain- or loss-of-function analyses revealed Nrf2 and FXR mediated the effect of curcumin on lipid deposition in hepatocytes, and curcumin modulated the expression of FXR mediated by Nrf2. Collectively, we drew a conclusion that curcumin attenuated ALD by modulating lipid deposition in hepatocytes via a Nrf2/FXR activation-dependent mechanism. The findings make curcumin a potential agent for ALD and broaden the horizon of the molecular mechanism involved.
Hyperlipidemia, characterized by high serum lipids, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have identified an important role for celastrol, a proteasome inhibitor isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F., in obesity-related metabolic disorders. However, the exact influences of celastrol on lipid metabolism remain largely unknown. Celastrol inhibited the terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and decreased the levels of triglycerides in wild-type mice. Lipidomics analysis revealed that celastrol increased the metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), sphingomyelins (SMs), and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). Further, celastrol reversed the tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia induced associated with increased plasma LPCs, PCs, SMs, and ceramides (CMs). Among these lipids, LPC(16:0), LPC(18:1), PC(22:2/15:0), and SM(d18:1/22:0) were also decreased by celastrol in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mice, and tyloxapol-treated mice. The mRNAs encoded by hepatic genes associated with lipid synthesis and catabolism, including Lpcat1, Pld1, Smpd3, and Sptc2, were altered in tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, and significantly recovered by celastrol treatment. The effect of celastrol on lipid metabolism was significantly reduced in Fxr-null mice, resulting in decreased Cers6 and Acer2 mRNAs compared to wild-type mice. These results establish that FXR was responsible in part for the effects of celastrol in controlling lipid metabolism and contributing to the recovery of aberrant lipid metabolism in obesity-related metabolic disorders.
Progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) manifests as hepatitis, fibrosis, and sometimes carcinoma, resulting in liver failure. Various clinical trials have indicated that several pharmacological agents, including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, are effective in NASH treatment. In addition, functional foods are expected to be important alternatives for treating or preventing NASH. Recently, focus has been directed toward microalgae as dietary supplements, mainly for lifestyle-related diseases, because they contain various nutrients and functional ingredients. Specifically, a unicellular microalga Euglena gracilis stores a unique Œ≤-1,3-glucan particle called paramylon that stimulates the immune system. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Euglena and paramylon on NASH in Stelic Animal Model (STAM) mice using Sirius red staining and confirmed that oral administration of Euglena or paramylon inhibits the process of liver fibrosis. Moreover, compared with controls, paramylon decreased non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity scores related to inflammation. These results indicate that the oral administration of Euglena and paramylon inhibits fibrosis and ameliorates NASH.
Activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor steroid superfamily, leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in several tissues, including the lung. We have recently demonstrated a protective effect of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) in rat models of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the positive effects of OCA treatment could be exerted also in established MCT-induced PAH, i.e., starting treatment 2¬†weeks after MCT administration.
Rats with MCT-induced PAH were treated, 2¬†weeks after MCT administration, with OCA or tadalafil for two additional weeks. Pulmonary functional tests were performed at week 2 (before treatment) and four (end of treatment). At the same time points, lung morphological features and expression profile of genes related to smooth muscle relaxation/contraction and tissue remodeling were also assessed.
2¬†weeks after MCT-induced injury, the treadmill resistance (a functional parameter related to pulmonary hypertension) was significantly decreased. At the same time point, we observed right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling, with upregulation of genes related to inflammation. At week 4, we observed a further worsening of the functional and morphological parameters, accompanied by dysregulation of inflammatory and extracellular matrix markers mRNA expression. Administration of OCA (3 or 10¬†mg/kg/day), starting 2¬†weeks after MCT-induced injury, significantly improved pulmonary function, effectively normalizing the exercise capacity. OCA also reverted most of the lung alterations, with a significant reduction of lung vascular wall thickness, right ventricular hypertrophy, and restoration of the local balance between relaxant and contractile pathways. Markers of remodeling pathways were also normalized by OCA treatment. Notably, results with OCA treatment were similar, or even superior, to those obtained with tadalafil, a recently approved treatment for pulmonary hypertension.
The results of this study demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect of OCA in established MCT-induced PAH, improving exercise capacity associated with reduction of right ventricular hypertrophy and lung vascular remodeling. Thus, OCA dosing in a therapeutic protocol restores the balance between relaxant and contractile pathways in the lung, promoting cardiopulmonary protective actions in MCT-induced PAH.
Placement of the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) leads to rapid weight loss and restoration of insulin sensitivity in a similar fashion to bariatric surgery. Increased systemic bile acid levels are candidate effectors for these effects through postprandial activation of their receptors TGR5 and FXR. We aimed to quantify postprandial bile acid, GLP-1 and FGF19 responses and assess their temporal relation to the weight loss and metabolic and hormonal changes seen after DJBL placement.
We performed mixed meal testing in 17 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) directly before, one week after and 6‚ÄØmonths after DJBL placement.
Both fasting and postprandial bile acid levels were unchanged at 1‚ÄØweek after implantation, and greatly increased 6‚ÄØmonths after implantation. The increase consisted of unconjugated bile acid species. 3‚ÄØhour-postprandial GLP-1 levels increased after 1‚ÄØweek and were sustained, whereas FGF19 levels and postprandial plasma courses were unaffected.
DJBL placement leads to profound increases in unconjugated bile acid levels after 6‚ÄØmonths, similar to the effects of bariatric surgery. The temporal dissociation between the changes in bile acids, GLP-1 and FGF19 and other gut hormone responses warrant caution about the beneficial role of bile acids after DJBL placement. This observational uncontrolled study emphasizes the need for future controlled studies.
Bile acids (BAs) are the major metabolic product of cholesterol, having detergent-like activities and being responsible for absorption of lipid and lipid-soluble vitamins. In addition, it has been increasingly recognized that BAs are important signaling molecules, regulating energy metabolism and immunity. Under physiological circumstances, synthesis and transport of BAs are precisely regulated to maintain bile acid homeostasis. Disruption of bile acid homeostasis results in pathological cholestasis and metabolic liver diseases. During the last decades, BAs have been gradually recognized as an important therapeutic target for novel treatment in chronic liver diseases. This review will provide an update on the current understanding of synthesis, transport and regulation of BAs, with a focus on the therapeutic roles of bile acid signaling in chronic liver diseases.
The molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains elusive. Both farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contribute to the progression of NAFLD; however, it is not clear whether the actions of these two pathways are dependent on each other. Moreover, the pharmacological benefits and mechanism of betulinic acid (BA) in controlling metabolic syndrome and NAFLD are largely unknown.
A reporter assay and a time-resolved FRET assay were used to identify BA as an agonist of the FXR. NAFLD was induced by a methionine and choline-deficient L-amino acid diet (MCD) and high-fat diet (HFD). The pharmacological effects of BA (100 mg¬∑kg-1 ¬∑day-1 ) and potential interactions between hepatic FXR activation and ER stress pathways were evaluated by FXR silencing, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses using control and FXR-/- mice.
Activation of the FXR inhibited intracellular PERK/EIF2Œ±/ATF4 and CHOP signalling, thereby alleviating hepatic ER stress, whereas FXR silencing resulted in an opposite effect. Furthermore, we identified BA as an FXR agonist that effectively attenuated the progression of NAFLD and metabolic disorders in both HFD- and MCD diet-fed mice and restored the hepatocellular ER homeostasis by stimulating the FXR signalling pathway and blocking PERK/EIF2Œ± signalling. In contrast, the effects of BA were attenuated in FXR-/- mice.
Our data demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the FXR by BA reduces hepatocellular ER stress and attenuates NAFLD in an animal model of hepatic steatosis.
Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Prof.‚ÄÖDr. Gisbert Schneider from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich (Switzerland). The cover picture illustrates the application of machine-learning methods to expand the chemical space of farnesoid‚ÄÖX receptor (FXR)-targeting small molecules, by employing an ensemble of three complementary machine-learning approaches (counter-propagation artificial neural network, k-nearest neighbor learner, and three-dimensional pharmacophore model).

Celastrol, derived from the roots of the Tripterygium Wilfordi, shows a striking effect on obesity. In the present study, the role of celastrol in cholestasis was investigated using metabolomics and transcriptomics. Celastrol treatment significantly alleviated cholestatic liver injury in mice induced by Œ±-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT) and thioacetamide (TAA). Celastrol was found to activate sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), increase farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling and inhibit nuclear factor-kappa B and P53 signaling. The protective role of celastrol in cholestatic liver injury was diminished in mice on co-administration of SIRT1 inhibitors. Further, the effects of celastrol on cholestatic liver injury were dramatically decreased in Fxr-null mice, suggesting that the SIRT1-FXR signaling pathway mediates the protective effects of celastrol. These observations demonstrated a novel role for celastrol in protecting against cholestatic liver injury through modulation of the SIRT1 and FXR.
We demonstrated the metabolic benefits of Parabacteroides distasonis (PD) on decreasing weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Treatment with live P.¬†distasonis (LPD) dramatically altered the bile acid profile with elevated lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and increased the level of succinate in the gut. In¬†vitro cultivation of PD demonstrated its capacity to transform bile acids and production of succinate. Succinate supplementation in the diet decreased hyperglycemia in ob/ob mice via the activation of¬†intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN). Gavage with a mixture of LCA and UDCA reduced hyperlipidemia by activating the FXR pathway and repairing gut¬†barrier integrity. Co-treatment with succinate and LCA/UDCA mirrored the benefits of LPD. The binding target of succinate was identified as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the rate-limiting enzyme in IGN. The succinate and secondary bile acids produced by P.¬†distasonis played key roles in the modulation of host metabolism.
The expression of the human organic cation transporter-1 (hOCT1, gene SLC22A1) is reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular bases of this reduction and its relationship with the poor response of HCC to sorafenib were investigated.
HCC transcriptomes from 366 samples available at TCGA were analysed. Alternative splicing was determined by RT-PCR. The role of miRNAs in SLC22A1 downregulation was investigated. Expression of Oct1 was measured in rodent HCC models (spontaneously generated in Fxr-/- mice and chemically-induced in rats). hOCT1 was overexpressed in human hepatoma cells (HuH7 and HepG2). Sorafenib and regorafenib uptake was determined by HPLC-MS/MS.
hOCT1 overexpression enhanced sorafenib, but not regorafenib, quinine-inhibitable uptake by hepatoma cells. In rodent HCC, Oct1 was downregulated, which was accompanied by impaired sorafenib uptake. In mice with s.c.-implanted HCC, sorafenib inhibited the growth of hOCT1 overexpressing tumours. In human HCC, hOCT1 expression was inversely correlated with SLC22A1 promoter methylation, whereas demethylation with decitabine enhanced hOCT1 expression in hepatoma cells. Increased proportion of aberrant hOCT1 mRNA variants was found in HCC samples. In silico analysis identified six miRNAs as candidates to target hOCT1 mRNA. When overexpressed in HepG2 cells a significant hOCT1 mRNA decay was induced by hsa-miR-330 and hsa-miR-1468. Analysis of 39 paired tumour/adjacent samples from TCGA revealed that hsa-mir-330 was consistently upregulated in HCC.
Impaired hOCT1 expression/function in HCC, in part due to epigenetic modifications, plays an important role in the poor pharmacological response of this cancer to sorafenib.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has an estimated prevalence of 25% in the general population, and cirrhosis secondary to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is predicted to become the leading cause of liver transplantation and yet there is a lack of effective licensed treatments. There is a close relationship between insulin resistance and NAFLD, with the prevalence of NAFLD being five-fold higher in patients with diabetes compared to patients without. Insulin resistance is implicated both in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and in disease progression from steatosis to NASH. Thus modulation of insulin resistance represents a potential strategy for NAFLD treatment. This review highlights key proposed mechanisms linking insulin resistance and NAFLD, such as changes in rates of adipose tissue lipolysis and de novo lipogenesis, impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, changes in fat distribution, alterations in the gut microbiome, and alterations in levels of adipokines and cytokines. Further, it goes on to discuss the main pharmacological strategies used to treat insulin resistance in patients with NAFLD, and their efficacy based on recently published experimental and clinical data. These include (biguanides, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR- Œ≥/ Œ±/Œ¥) agonists, Sodium Glucose Cotransporter (SGLT2) inhibitors and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists), with further novel treatments on the horizon. Ideally treatment would improve insulin resistance, reduce cardiovascular risk and produce demonstrable improvements in NASH histology - this is likely to be achieved with a combinatorial approach.

Bile acids (BA) are increasingly recognized as pleiotropic and hormone-like signaling molecules with metabolic and endocrine functions. However, the role of BA in white adipocyte physiology remains somewhat obscure. It was the aim to investigate the BA receptors (FXR, TGR5) and FGFR1 (Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) as well as Bsep (bile salt export pump) in white adipocytes and in murine and human adipose tissue (AT) and to investigate effects of different BA species in adipocyte physiology.
Receptor mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR in mice, humans and during 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation. Adipokines were measured by ELISA upon stimulation by several BA. Effects of BA on TNF- and LPS-induced MCP-1 secretion and lipolysis were analyzed. TNF-induced lipolysis was investigated by glycerol assay.
The present data provide for the first time a detailed expression profile of FXR, TGR5, FGFR1, and Bsep during adipocyte differentiation and in murine and human AT. FGFR1 expression is upregulated in adipose tissue of LPS-injected animals. Several BA regulate secretion of adipokines such as adiponectin and resistin differentially. Importantly, TNF- and LPS-induced MCP-1 release from adipocytes as well as TNF-induced lipolysis can be antagonized by cholic acid (CA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA).
The present data provide evidence of functional BA signaling pathways in adipocytes and argue for certain MCP-1 related anti-inflammatory effects of BA in TNF- and LPS-induced inflammation, whereas pro-inflammatory resistin is induced by CA and glycocholic acid (GCA). Systemic bile acids might represent a hormonal network regulating white adipocyte physiology including lipolysis.
Numerous micro-organisms naturally reside in the human body assuming a symbiotic, or, at times, even a dysbiotic relationship with the host. These microbial populations are referred to as the human microbiota. Host microbial populations are an important mediator of gastro-intestinal mucosal permeability, bile acid metabolism, short-chain fatty acids synthesis, fermentation of dietary polysaccharides and FXR/TGR5 signaling. Variations in the composition and function of gut microbiota have been observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and obesity, as well as in inflammatory bowel diseases. The microbial imbalance induced by such pathological processes is described as dysbiosis. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological links between type 2 diabetes mellitus and gut microbiota, explore the effect of anti-diabetic drugs on gut microbiota and suggest possible therapeutic targets.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients benefit from physical exercise. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acute exercise on hepatic gene expression in different mouse models of NAFLD.
C57BL/6J mice were fed with a control (CD) or a high fat (HFD) diet. AlbCrePtenflox/flox (Pten-KO) and Fxr-/- mice, two genetic models of NAFLD with insulin hypersensitivity and resistance, respectively, were fed with CD. After 4¬†weeks, mice were randomly assigned to exercise or sedentariness. Mice were killed 15¬†min or 3¬†h after the running/sedentary period. Genome-wide hepatic gene expression was evaluated with the Illumina Micro-array platform. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed changes in gene expression.
Acute exercise transiently affected the expression of genes involved in the immune response in C57BL/6 mice fed with CD and this effect normalized in the recovery phase. Acute exercise affected genes involved in gluconeogenesis in the insulin resistant Fxr-/- model. Genes involved in lipid metabolism were affected in C57BL/6 mice fed with CD, but not in mouse models of NAFLD. Genes involved in DNA damage response pathways were deregulated only in C57BL/6 mice fed with CD and not in mouse models of NAFLD.
The simultaneous analysis of different NAFLD models revealed that an acute exercise bout affects hepatic gene expression differentially according to animal models and that most of the differentially expressed genes are involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism, immune regulation, and DNA damage response.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate the transcription of target genes. Previous epidemiological and genetic studies have documented the association of NRs with the risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the mechanisms of action of NRs in IBD have not been fully established, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NRs play complicated roles in regulating intestinal immunity, mucosal barriers, and intestinal flora. As one of the first-line medications for the treatment of IBD, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARŒ≥) to attenuate colitis. The protective roles of rifaximin and rifampicin partly depend on promoting pregnane X receptor (PXR) expression. The aims of this review are to discuss the roles of several important NRs, such as PPARŒ≥, PXR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and RAR-related orphan receptor gammat (RORŒ≥t), in the pathogenesis of IBD and management strategies based on targeting these receptors.
Cholesterol gallstone disease have relationships with various conditions linked with insulin resistance, but also with heart disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. These associations derive from mechanisms active at a local (i.e. gallbladder, bile) and a systemic level and are involved in inflammation, hormones, nuclear receptors, signaling molecules, epigenetic modulation of gene expression, and gut microbiota. Despite advanced knowledge of these pathways, the available therapeutic options for symptomatic gallstone patients remain limited. Therapy includes oral litholysis by the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in a small subgroup of patients at high risk of postdissolution recurrence, or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the therapeutic radical gold standard treatment. Cholecystectomy, however, may not be a neutral event, and potentially generates health problems, including the metabolic syndrome. Areas covered: Several studies on risk factors and pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease, acting at a systemic level have been reviewed through a PubMed search. Authors have focused on primary prevention and novel potential therapeutic strategies. Expert commentary: The ultimate goal appears to target the manageable systemic mechanisms responsible for gallstone occurrence, pointing to primary prevention measures. Changes must target lifestyles, as well as experimenting innovative pharmacological tools in subgroups of patients at high risk of developing gallstones.
Recent findings have shown that Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) antagonists might be useful in the treatment of cholestasis and related metabolic disorders. In this paper, we report the discovery of a new chemotype of FXR antagonists featured by a 3,5-disubstituted oxadiazole core. In total, 35 new derivatives were designed and synthesized, and notably, compounds 3f and 13, containing a piperidine ring, displayed the best antagonistic activity against FXR with promising cellular potency (IC50 = 0.58 ¬± 0.27 and 0.127 ¬± 0.02 ŒºM, respectively). The excellent pharmacokinetic properties make compound 3f the most promising lead identified in this study.
Acetaminophen misuse is a leading cause of acute liver failure and liver transplantation for which therapy is poorly effective. FXR ligands have shown effective in reducing liver injury in several experimental and clinical settings. In this Letter, we have elaborated on the structure of GW4064, the first nonsteroidal agonist for FXR, to identify novel isoxazoles endowed with FXR agonistic activity and improved ADME properties. The pharmacological characterization and molecular docking studies for the structure-activity rationalization allowed the identification of several FXR agonists with nanomolar potency in transactivation and SRC-1 recruitment assays. This characterization resulted in the identification of a potent FXR agonist, compound 20 that was orally active, and rescued mice from acute liver failure caused by acetaminophen overdose in a FXR-dependent manner.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates inflammation and immune responses in a subset of immune-mediated diseases. We previously reported that FXR expression promotes tumor cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we study the relevance of FXR to the immune microenvironment of NSCLC. We found an inverse correlation between FXR and PD-L1 expression in a cohort of 408 NSCLC specimens; from this, we identified a subgroup of FXRhighPD-L1low patients. We showed that FXR downregulates PD-L1 via transrepression and other mechanisms in NSCLC. Cocultured with FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC cell lines, effector function and proliferation of CD8+ T cell in vitro are repressed. We also detected downregulation of PD-L1 in FXR-overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mouse syngeneic models, indicating an FXRhighPD-L1low subtype in which FXR suppresses tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Anti-PD-1 therapy was effective against FXRhighPD-L1low mouse LLC tumors. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an immunosuppressive role for FXR in the FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC subtype and provide translational insights into therapeutic response in PD-L1low NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1. We recommend FXRhighPD-L1low as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.
The etiology of autoimmune liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), still remains largely unknown and no therapeutic agents that are able to "cure" these diseases have been developed. Although corticosteroids for AIH and ursodeoxycholic acid for PBC have been shown to significantly improve liver transplantation (LT)-free survival and are recommended as first-line drugs, treatment strategies for patients who show incomplete response to these drugs have not yet been fully established. No drug is significantly associated with long LT-free survival in PSC patients. Nevertheless, with progress in genetics, immunology, and cellular biology, several new compounds or antibodies are expected to have an effect on autoimmune liver diseases and several drugs are under consideration for clinical use. Although most clinical trials have been carried out in the USA or Europe, some are, or will be, undertaken in Japan in the future. In this review, the current standard-of-care of autoimmune liver diseases will be summarized, together with emerging novel treatments relevant to clinical practice in Japan.
The tumor microenvironment is a complex and dynamic cellular community comprising the tumor epithelium and various tumor-supporting cells such as immune cells, fibroblasts, immunosuppressive cells, adipose cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes. The interplay between the tumor microenvironment and tumor cells represents a key contributor to immune evasiveness, physiological hardiness and the local and systemic invasiveness of malignant cells. Nuclear receptors are master regulators of physiological processes and are known to play pro-/anti-oncogenic activities in tumor cells. However, the actions of nuclear receptors in tumor-supporting cells have not been widely studied. Given the excellent druggability and extensive regulatory effects of nuclear receptors, understanding their biological functionality in the tumor microenvironment is of utmost importance. Therefore, the present review aims to summarize recent evidence about the roles of nuclear receptors in tumor-supporting cells and their implications for malignant processes such as tumor proliferation, evasion of immune surveillance, angiogenesis, chemotherapeutic resistance, and metastasis. Based on findings derived mostly from cell culture studies and a few in vivo animal cancer models, the functions of VDR, PPARs, AR, ER and GR in tumor-supporting cells are relatively well-characterized. Evidence for other receptors, such as RARŒ≤, RORŒ≥, and FXR, is limited yet promising. Hence, the nuclear receptor signature in the tumor microenvironment may harbor prognostic value. The clinical prospects of a tumor microenvironment-oriented cancer therapy exploiting the nuclear receptors in different tumor-supporting cells are also encouraging. The major challenge, however, lies in the ability to develop a highly specific drug delivery system to facilitate precision medicine in cancer therapy.
Brain- and lesion-volumes derived from magnetic resonance images (MRI) serve as important imaging markers of disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. While manual segmentation of these volumes is both tedious and impractical in large cohorts of subjects, automated segmentation methods often fail in accurate segmentation of brains with severe atrophy or high lesion loads. The purpose of this study was to develop an atlas-free brain Classification using DErivative-based Features (C-DEF), which utilizes all scans that may be acquired during the course of a routine MRI study at any center.
Proton-density, T2-weighted, T1-weighted, brain-free water, 3D FLAIR, 3D T2-weighted, and 3D T2*-weighted images, collected routinely on patients with neuroinflammatory diseases at the NIH, were used to optimize the C-DEF algorithm on healthy volunteers and HIV + subjects (cohort 1). First, manually marked lesions and eroded FreeSurfer brain segmentation masks (compiled into gray and white matter, globus pallidus, CSF labels) were used in training. Next, the optimized C-DEF was applied on a separate cohort of HIV + subjects (cohort two), and the results were compared with that of FreeSurfer and Lesion-TOADS. Finally, C-DEF segmentation was evaluated on subjects clinically diagnosed with various other neurological diseases (cohort three).
C-DEF algorithm was optimized using leave-one-out cross validation on five healthy subjects (age 36 ¬± 11 years), and five subjects infected with HIV (age 57 ¬± 2.6 years) in cohort one. The optimized C-DEF algorithm outperformed FreeSurfer and Lesion-TOADS segmentation in 49 other subjects infected with HIV (cohort two, age 54 ¬± 6 years) in qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Although trained only on HIV brains, sensitivity to detect lesions using C-DEF increased by 45% in HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (n = 5; age 58 ¬± 7 years), 33% in multiple sclerosis (n = 5; 42 ¬± 9 years old), and 4% in subjects with polymorphism of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 gene (n = 5; age 24 ¬± 12 years) compared to Lesion-TOADS.
C-DEF outperformed other segmentation algorithms in the various neurological diseases explored herein, especially in lesion segmentation. While the results reported are from routine images acquired at the NIH, the algorithm can be easily trained and optimized for any set of contrasts and protocols for wider application. We are currently exploring various technical aspects of optimal implementation of CDEF in a clinical setting and evaluating a larger cohort of patients with other neurological diseases. Improving the accuracy of brain segmentation methodology will help better understand the relationship of imaging abnormalities to clinical and neuropsychological markers in disease.
We reported that 30% of individuals with medically complicated obesity have bowel symptoms, suggesting irritable bowel syndrome, but this prevalence of bowel symptoms is not related to body mass index or diabetes mellitus. Hypovitaminosis D is common in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and is associated with depressive symptoms. Because antidepressants improve global symptoms in individuals with bowel symptoms, we hypothesize that the high prevalence of bowel symptoms in medically complicated obesity is associated with hypovitaminosis D. This is a single-institution, retrospective cohort study performed in a large, urban community teaching hospital. Over 2 years, individuals considering bariatric surgery completed a Manning symptom questionnaire to quantify bowel symptoms. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was ordered, and the results were recorded for all individuals. Among 271 subjects, 229 subjects (80% women, 20% men; 67% black, 31% white; age range: 23-73‚ÄØyears; body mass index range: 35-91‚ÄØkg/m2) completed 25-hydroxy vitamin D testing. Sixty-seven subjects (29%) have 3 to 6 Manning bowel symptoms, suggesting irritable bowel syndrome; 84 (37%) have type 2 diabetes; and 180 (79%) had vitamin D insufficiency. There are significant negative associations between Manning bowel symptoms and vitamin D concentrations in subjects with obesity (P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ.01) and with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity (P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ.007). The results support our hypothesis that the high prevalence of bowel symptoms in people with medically complicated obesity is associated with hypovitaminosis D. A prospective study is required to evaluate vitamin D supplementation and relief of bowel symptoms in people with medically complicated obesity.


Heavy metals, also regarded as toxic metals, are the important environmental pollutants that affect all forms of life. Accumulation of toxic metals in plants results in various biochemical, physiological and structural disturbances, leading to inhibited growth and sometimes plant death. Toxic metal contamination disturbs the soil ecology as well as the agricultural productivity. Several indigenous microbes can withstand the effect of toxic metal and play a vital role in the revival of tarnished soil. In the present study, soil samples were collected from contaminated crop field of Cachar district of Assam, India. Segregation, enumeration and identification of bacteria from soil samples were performed. Among all the tested isolates, very few were able to withstand a high concentration of Cd and Pb in nutrient agar plates. Toxic metal-tolerant bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. The isolates having a higher tolerance for Cd and Pb were taken into consideration for pot studies. P. aeruginosa strain SN4 and strain SN5 showed significant results at Cd- and Pb-contaminated soil, evidenced by the healthy growth of Oryza sativa seedlings. However, B. cereus strain SN6 showed high tolerance towards Cd and Pb, but pot experimental studies showed adverse effects on seedling germination and shoot growth of O. sativa. P. aeruginosa strains were significantly able to reduce the negative impact of Cd and Pb in the soil, thus finding an alternative in removal, recovery and remediation of toxic metal-contaminated crop field.
Olecranon fractures are common upper-extremity fractures amenable to various surgical techniques. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate surgical management strategies for olecranon fractures in adult patients. Two investigators independently screened articles from records obtained from MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases. The authors compared tension-band wiring (TBW) with plate fixation (PF) for the outcomes of complications and hardware removal. Subgroup analyses were conducted comparing randomized controlled trials with observational studies for each outcome. In addition, the authors evaluated novel fixation techniques other than TBW and PF. Twenty-four studies were included in the systematic review and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis of TBW vs PF. Compared with TBW (n=270), patients who underwent PF (n=369) had a significantly lower complication rate (relative risk, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.64; P&lt;.01; I2=16%). Plate fixation (41 of 332) also had less hardware removal compared with TBW (79 of 236; relative risk, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.50; P&lt;.01; I2=0%). Subgroup analyses showed no difference when comparing randomized controlled trials with observational studies for the outcomes of complication rate (P=.45) and hardware removal (P=.54). Qualitative analysis revealed novel methods of olecranon fixation: a modified cable pin system, tension banding through 2 cannulated screws, olecranon memory connector fixation, and cancellous screw TBW. This meta-analysis revealed significantly lower complication and hardware removal rates for PF compared with TBW. Several novel methods of olecranon fixation may represent viable alternatives.

The formation of protein aggregates is linked to several diseases collectively called proteinopathies. The mechanisms and the molecular players that control the turnover of protein aggregates are not well defined. We recently showed that TRIM16 acts as a key regulatory protein to control the biogenesis and degradation of protein aggregates. We show that TRIM16 interacts with, enhances K63-linked ubiquitination of, and stabilizes NFE2L2/NRF2 leading to its activation. The activated NFE2L2 upregulates the SQSTM1/p62 and ubiquitin pathway proteins, which interact with and ubiquitinate the misfolded proteins resulting in protein aggregate formation. TRIM16 is physically present around the protein aggregates and acts as a scaffold protein to recruit SQSTM1 and macroautophagy/autophagy initiation proteins for sequestration of the protein aggregates within autophagosomes, leading to their degradation. Hence, TRIM16 utilizes a two-pronged approach to safely dispose of the stress-induced misfolded proteins and protein aggregates, and protect cells from oxidative and proteotoxic stresses. This study could provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of protein aggregate formation in neurodegeneration. The enhancement of TRIM16 activity could be a beneficial therapeutic approach in proteinopathies. On the flip side, cancer cells appear to hijack this machinery for their survival under stress conditions; hence, depleting TRIM16 could be a beneficial therapeutic strategy for treating cancer.
Smoking is a strong risk factor for albuminuria in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is unclear whether this sequela of smoking is brought about by its action on cardiometabolic parameters or the relationship is independent. The aim of this systematic review is to explore this relationship.
Electronic databases on cross-sectional and prospective studies in Medline and Embase were searched from January 1946 to May 2018. Adult smokers with T2DM were included, and other types of diabetes were excluded.
A random effects meta-analysis of 20,056 participants from 13 studies found that the odds ratio (OR) of smokers developing albuminuria compared to non-smokers was 2.13 (95% CI 1.32, 3.45). Apart from smoking, the odds ratio of other risk factors associated with albuminuria were: age 1.24 (95% CI 0.84, 1.64), male sex 1.39 (95% CI 1.16, 1.67), duration of diabetes 1.78 (95% CI 1.32, 2.23), HbA1c 0.63 (95% CI 0.45, 0.81), SBP 6.03 (95% CI 4.10, 7.97), DBP 1.85 (95% CI 1.08, 2.62), total cholesterol 0.06 (95% CI -‚Äâ0.05, 0.17) and HDL cholesterol -‚Äâ0.01 (95% CI -‚Äâ0.04, 0.02), triglyceride 0.22 (95% CI 0.12, 0.33) and BMI 0.40 (95% CI 0.00-0.80). When the smoking status was adjusted in a mixed effect meta-regression model, the duration of diabetes was the only statistically significant factor that influenced the prevalence of albuminuria. In smokers, each year's increase in the duration of T2DM was associated with an increased risk of albuminuria of 0.19 units (95% CI 0.07, 0.31) on the log odds scale or increased the odds approximately by 23%, compared to non-smokers. Prediction from the meta-regression model also suggested that the odds ratios of albuminuria in smokers after a diabetes duration of 9¬†years and 16¬†years were 1.53 (95% CI 1.10, 2.13) and 5.94 (95% CI 2.53, 13.95), respectively.
Continuing to smoke and the duration of diabetes are two strong predictors of albuminuria in smokers with T2DM. With a global surge in younger smokers developing T2DM, smoking cessation interventions at an early stage of disease trajectory should be promoted.
Neurotrophic factors like Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), play a role in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis contributing to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The objective of the present study was to investigate and compare the effect of olanzapine and lurasidone on the change in serum neurotrophins in patients with schizophrenia. The present study was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel design clinical trial. After randomization baseline evaluations of serum BDNF, NGF, NT3, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scoring, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) scoring of 101 unmedicated schizophrenia patients were done. Patients were reassessed after 6 weeks of monotherapy with olanzapine or lurasidone. Serum BDNF increased after treatment with both the drug groups but rise with olanzapine was found to be significantly higher (916.22; 95 %CI: 866.07 to 966.37; p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.001) in comparison to lurasidone. Increase in levels NGF and NT3 was also observed but there was no significant difference between the groups (NGF: 2.32; CI: 3.54 to -3.53; p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.57 and NT3: 0.99; CI: 2.11 to 0.14; p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.086). The difference in improvement in PANSS and SOFASS with both the drugs was not statistically significant. Both the drugs alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia but olanzapine was better tolerated. Our findings suggest that increase in serum BDNF with olanzapine monotherapy is significantly higher than that with lurasidone but there is no significant difference in change in serum NGF and NT3.

There are no reported survivors of gastroschisis with complete liver herniation. We describe a case report of two patients, one of whom survived.
The patient was born with gastroschisis and herniation of the entire liver. Along with silo placement, the abdominal fascia was attached to an external traction system for growth. Complete closure was achieved at 5 months. Due to pulmonary hypoplasia, high-frequency ventilation was required. The patient is doing well, on a home ventilator wean, at 20 months.
The patient was born prematurely with gastroschisis, total liver herniation, and a defect extending to the pericardium. A silo was attached to the fascia to provide growth of the abdominal cavity. The patient developed respiratory failure, diffuse anasarca, and renal failure. She died at 38 days of life.
We report the first survivor of gastroschisis with complete liver herniation, contrasting it with a death of a similar case. The associated pulmonary hypoplasia may require long-term ventilation, the inflammatory response can lead to anasarca, and renal injury can occur from acute-on-chronic compartment syndrome.
External fascial traction systems can help induce growth of the abdominal wall, allowing closure of the challenging abdomen. While critical care management is complex, survival is possible.
We report the first observation of the spontaneous polarization of Œõ and Œõ[over ¬Ø] hyperons transverse to the production plane in e^{+}e^{-} annihilation, which is attributed to the effect arising from a polarizing fragmentation function. For inclusive Œõ/Œõ[over ¬Ø] production, we also report results with subtracted feed-down contributions from Œ£^{0} and charm. This measurement uses a dataset of 800.4‚Äâ‚Äâfb^{-1} collected by the Belle experiment at or near a center-of-mass energy of 10.58¬†GeV. We observe a significant polarization that rises with the fractional energy carried by the Œõ/Œõ[over ¬Ø] hyperon.
Diabetes is a foremost health problem globally susceptible to increased mortality and morbidity. The present therapies in the antidiabetic class have sound adverse effects and thus, emphasis on the further need to develop effective medication therapy. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha-gamma dual approach represents an interesting target for developing novel anti-diabetic drug along with potential anti-hyperlipidimic activity. In the current study, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha-gamma agonistic hits were screened by hierarchical virtual screening of drug like compounds followed by molecular dynamics simulation and knowledge-based structure-activity relation analysis. The key amino acid residues of binding pockets of both target proteins were acknowledged as essential and were found to be associated in the key interactions with the most potential dual hit. This dual targeted approach of structure based computational technique was undertaken to identify prevalent promising hits for both targets with binding energy and absorption distribution metabolism excretion prediction supported the analysis of their pharmacokinetic potential. In addition, stability analysis using molecular dynamics simulation of the target protein complexes was performed with the most promising dual targeted hit found in this study. Further, comparative analysis of binding site of both targets was done for the development of knowledge-based structure-activity relationship, which may useful for successful designing of dual agonistic candidates.

Gadolinium doping effects on structural-, electronic transport and magnetic properties of Pr0.6Gd0.1Sr0.3MnO‚ÇÉ (PGSMO) nanomanganite (40-65 nm) have been investigated. We have considered the core-shell structure of our PGSMO nanoparticles, which can explain its intriguing magnetic and transport properties. It is reported 65 nm sample exhibits higher metal to insulator transition temperature, TP (‚àº215 K) and less resistive behavior compare to its nano counterparts. Enhanced low-field magnetoresistance (LFMR) is observed with a reduction of particle size; however maximum change in magnetoresistance (MR), ‚àº72% is recorded for 65 nm sample around TP at 60 kOe field. Low-temperature magnetization data reveals the existence of glassy phase in the compound. It is revealed that substitution of optimal Gd doping at A site on nanometric scale promotes exotic magnetic and transport properties on nanoscale without adding any external physical perturbation or introducing any significant lattice distortion.
Background The endothelial glycocalyx is a vasoprotective barrier between the blood and endothelium. We hypothesized that glycocalyx degradation is present in preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder characterized by endothelial dysfunction and activation. Methods and Results We examined the sublingual glycocalyx noninvasively using sidestream dark field imaging in the third trimester among women with normotensive pregnancies (n=73), early (n=14) or late (n=29) onset preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes mellitus (n=21). We calculated the width of the glycocalyx that was permeable to red blood cells (called the perfused boundary region, a measure of glycocalyx degradation) and the percentage of vessels that were filled with red blood cells ‚â•50% of the time (a measure of microvascular perfusion). In addition, we measured circulating levels of glycocalyx components, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, and SDC1 (syndecan 1), in a subset of participants by ELISA . Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to adjust for vessel diameter and caffeine intake. Women with early onset preeclampsia showed higher glycocalyx degradation, indicated by a larger perfused boundary region (mean: 2.14 [95% CI, 2.05-2.20]), than the remaining groups (mean: normotensive: 1.99 [95% CI, 1.95-2.02], P=0.002; late-onset preeclampsia: 2.01 [95% CI, 1.96-2.07], P=0.024; gestational diabetes mellitus: 1.97 [95% CI, 1.91-2.04], P=0.004). The percentage of vessels that were filled with red blood cells was significantly lower in early onset preeclampsia. These structural glycocalyx changes were accompanied by elevated plasma concentrations of the glycocalyx components, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, in early onset preeclampsia compared with normotensive pregnancy. Conclusions Glycocalyx degradation and reduced microvascular perfusion are associated with endothelial dysfunction and activation and vascular injury in early onset preeclampsia.
Fatness stigma is pervasive. Being fat is widely regarded a bad thing, and fat persons suffer numerous social and material disadvantages in virtue of their weight being regarded that way. Despite the seriousness of this problem, it has received relatively little attention from analytic philosophers. In this paper, I set out to explore whether there is a reasoned basis for stigmatizing fatness, and, if so, what forms of stigmatization could be justified. I consider two lines of reasoning that might be advanced to defend fat stigma. The first is broadly consequentialist. It seeks to justify stigmatizing fatness based on the public health benefits that might be produced by doing so. The second argument takes stigmatizing fatness to be a warranted response to the morally blameworthy failure to slim down exhibited by fat persons. Clarifying and assessing each of these two lines of reasoning is the main task of this paper. I argue that, upon careful examination, both these attempts to justify the stigmatization of fatness fail.
Over the past five decades, the incidence of intravenous drug use- (IVDU-) associated infective endocarditis (IE) has been on the rise in North America. Classically, IVDU has been thought to affect right-sided valves. However, in recent times a more variable presentation of IVDU-associated IE has been reported. Here, we report a case of a patient with a known history of IVDU who presented with clinical symptoms concerning for right- as well as left-sided endocarditis. In addition, we also discuss what should be considered adequate evaluation for patients with suspected endocarditis, and more specifically, what should be the role of transesophageal echocardiography in patients with IE noted on transthoracic echocardiography.
