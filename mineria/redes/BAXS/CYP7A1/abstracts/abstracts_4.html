<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused primarily by mutations in NPC1. NPC1 encodes the lysosomal cholesterol transport protein NPC1. The most common NPC1 mutation is a missense mutation (NPC1I1061T) that causes misfolding and rapid degradation of mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cholesterol accumulates in enlarged lysosomes as a result of decreased levels of lysosomal NPC1I1061T protein in patient cells. There is currently no cure or FDA-approved treatment for patients. We sought to identify novel compounds that decrease lysosomal cholesterol storage in NPC1I1061T/I1061T patient fibroblasts using a high-content screen with the cholesterol dye, filipin and the lysosomal marker, LAMP1. A total of 3532 compounds were screened, including 2013 FDA-approved drugs, 327 kinase inhibitors and 760 serum metabolites. Twenty-three hits were identified that decreased both filipin and LAMP1 signals. The majority of hits (16/21) were histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, a previously described class of modifiers of NPC cholesterol storage. Of the remaining hits, the antimicrobial compound, alexidine dihydrochloride had the most potent lysosomal cholesterol-reducing activity. Subsequent analyses showed that alexidine specifically increased levels of NPC1 transcript and mature protein in both control and NPC patient cells. Although unsuitable for systemic therapy, alexidine represents a unique tool compound for further NPC studies and as a potent inducer of NPC1. Together, these findings confirm the utility of high-content image-based compound screens of NPC1 patient cells and support extending the approach into larger compound collections.
Sterols are essential nutrients for eukaryotes. Insects are obligate sterol auxotrophs and must acquire this key nutrient from their diets. The digestive tract is the organ for absorbing nutrients as well as sterols from food. In mice, the Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) gene is highly expressed in the intestine and is critical for cholesterol absorption. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms for the absorption of dietary sterols in insects have not been well studied. We annotated NPC1 genes in 39 insects from 10 orders using available genomic and transcriptomic information and inferred phylogenetic relationships. Insect NPC1 genes were grouped into two sister-clades, NPC1a and NPC1b, suggesting a likely duplication in the ancestor of insects. The former exhibited weaker gut-biased expression or a complete lack of tissue-biased expression, depending on the species, while the latter was highly enriched in the gut of three lepidopteran species. This result is similar to previous findings in Drosophila melanogaster. In insects, NPC1a accumulated non-synonymous substitutions at a lower rate than NPC1b. This pattern was consistent across orders, indicating that NPC1a evolved under stronger molecular constraint than NPC1b.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a progressive and life limiting autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Mutations in these genes are associated with abnormal endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, resulting in the accumulation of multiple tissue specific lipids in the lysosomes. The clinical spectrum of NPC disease ranges from a neonatal rapidly progressive fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The age of onset of the first (beyond 3 months of life) neurological symptom may predict the severity of the disease and determines life expectancy.NPC has an estimated incidence of ~ 1: 100,000 and the rarity of the disease translate into misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and barriers to good care. For these reasons, we have developed clinical guidelines that define standard of care for NPC patients, foster shared care arrangements between expert centres and family physicians, and empower patients. The information contained in these guidelines was obtained through a systematic review of the literature and the experiences of the authors in their care of patients with NPC. We adopted the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp; Evaluation (AGREE II) system as method of choice for the guideline development process. We made a series of conclusive statements and scored them according to level of evidence, strengths of recommendations and expert opinions. These guidelines can inform care providers, care funders, patients and their carers of best practice of care for patients with NPC. In addition, these guidelines have identified gaps in the knowledge that must be filled by future research. It is anticipated that the implementation of these guidelines will lead to a step change in the quality of care for patients with NPC irrespective of their geographical location.
The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe human infection that lacks effective treatment. A recent screen identified a series of compounds that block EBOV-like particle entry into human cells. Using data from this screen, quantitative structure-activity relationship models were built and employed for virtual screening of a ∼17 million compound library. Experimental testing of 102 hits yielded 14 compounds with IC50 values under 10 μM, including several sub-micromolar inhibitors, and more than 10-fold selectivity against host cytotoxicity. These confirmed hits include FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates with non-antiviral indications, as well as compounds with novel scaffolds and no previously known bioactivity. Five selected hits inhibited BSL-4 live-EBOV infection in a dose-dependent manner, including vindesine (0.34 μM). Additional studies of these novel anti-EBOV compounds revealed their mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of NPC1 protein, cathepsin B/L, and lysosomal function. Compounds identified in this study are among the most potent and well-characterized anti-EBOV inhibitors reported to date.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. NPC1 is associated with neuroinflammation; however, attempts to therapeutically target neuroinflammation in NPC1 have had mixed success. We show here that NPC1 neuroinflammation is characterized by an atypical microglia activation phenotype. Specifically, Npc1-/- microglia demonstrated altered morphology, reduced levels of lineage markers and a shift toward glycolytic metabolism. Treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), a drug currently being studied in a phase 2b/3 clinical trial, reversed all microglia-associated defects in Npc1-/- animals. In addition, impairing microglia mediated neuroinflammation by genetic deletion of IRF8 led to decreased symptoms and increased lifespan. We identified CD22 as a marker of dysregulated microglia in Npc1 mutant mice and subsequently demonstrated that elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels of CD22 in NPC1 patients responds to HPβCD administration. Collectively, these data provide the first in-depth analysis of microglia function in NPC1 and suggest possible new therapeutic approaches.
Niemann-Pick-disease type C1 (NPC1) is an autosomal-recessive cholesterol-storage disorder. Besides other symptoms, NPC1 patients develop liver dysfunction and hepatosplenomegaly. The mechanisms of hepatomegaly and alterations of lipid metabolism-related genes in NPC1 disease are still poorly understood. Here, we used an NPC1 mouse model to study an additive hepatoprotective effect of a combination of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), miglustat and allopregnanolone (combination therapy) with the previously established monotherapy using HPβCD. We examined transgene effects as well as treatment effects on liver morphology and hepatic lipid metabolism, focusing on hepatic cholesterol transporter genes. Livers of Npc1-/- mice showed hepatic cholesterol sequestration with consecutive liver injury, an increase of lipogenetic gene expression, e.g., HMG-CoA, a decrease of lipolytic gene expression, e.g., pparα and acox1, and a decrease of lipid transporter gene expression, e.g., acat1, abca1 and fatp2. Both, combination therapy and monotherapy, led to a reduction of hepatic lipids and an amelioration of NPC1 liver disease symptoms. Monotherapy effects were related to pparα- and acox1-associated lipolysis/β-oxidation and to fatp2-induced fatty acid transport, whereas the combination therapy additionally increased the cholesterol transport via abca1 and apoE. However, HPβCD monotherapy additionally increased cholesterol synthesis as indicated by a marked increase of the HMG-CoA and srebp-2 mRNA expression, probably as a result of increased hepatocellular proliferation.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are of significant interest as drugs. However, their use to treat neurological disorders has raised concern because HDACs are required for brain function. We have previously shown that a triple combination formulation (TCF) of the pan HDACi vorinostat (Vo), 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 improves pharmacokinetic exposure and entry of Vo into the brain. TCF treatment significantly delayed both neurodegeneration and death in the Npc1 nmf164 murine model of Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease. The TCF induces no metabolic toxicity, but its risk to normal brain functions and potential utility in treating lung disease, a major NPC clinical complication, remain unknown. Here we report that TCF administered in healthy mice for 8-10 months was not detrimental to the brain or neuromuscular functions based on quantitative analyses of Purkinje neurons, neuroinflammation, neurocognitive/muscular disease symptom progression, cerebellar/hippocampal nerve fiber-staining, and Hdac gene-expression. The TCF also improved delivery of Vo to lungs and reduced accumulation of foamy macrophages in Npc1 nmf164 mice, with no injury. Together, these data support feasibility of tolerable, chronic administration of an HDACi formulation that treats murine NPC neurological disease and lung pathology, a frequent cause of death in this and possibly additional disorders.
Recent studies showed that atherosclerosis is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) and Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is the most important protein of the lysosomal membrane that is involved in the removal of FC from lysosomes. Whereas several in vitro and in vivo studies have described the crosstalk between lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and increased inflammation, there is no study addressing the correlation between NPC1 gene expression and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10 (IL-10) serum concentration in atherosclerotic patients.
IL-10 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in atherosclerotic patients (n = 40) and a control group (n = 40). NPC1 gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR, and correlation between the two parameters was assessed.
Mean IL-10 serum concentration and peripheral blood mononuclear cells' (PBMCs) gene expression of NPC1, adjusted for drug consumption, age, and BMI, was not significantly different between the patient and control groups (p = 0.6 and 0.67 respectively). However, NPC1 gene expression showed positive significant correlation with IL-10 serum concentration (p = 0.04, r = 0.29). We also observed lower serum concentration of IL-10 in the subjects with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration (p = 0.034).
Our findings supported the previous observations showing the contribution of lysosomal lipid homeostasis of PBMCs to inflammation and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Niemann-Pick disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease. NPC1-patients suffer, amongst others, from ataxia, based on a loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Impaired expression/function of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are suspected of contributing to PC-degeneration in hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Thus, we studied EAAT-expression and its impact to PC-activity in NPC1-/-mice. Western blot revealed reduced EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT4, and βIII-spectrin levels in NPC1-/-mice. EAATs play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, thus we were interested in the impact of the reduced EAAT-expression on the function of PCs. Patch-clamp recordings of PCs showed no differences in the firing patterns of NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice using a low internal chloride concentration. Because EAAT4 also comprises a chloride permeable ion pore, we perturbed the chloride homeostasis using a high internal chloride concentration. We observed differences in the firing patterns of NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice, suggesting an impact of the altered EAAT4-expression. Additionally, the EAAT-antagonist DL-TBOA acts differently in NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice. Our data support the line of evidence that an altered EAAT-expression/function is involved in neurodegeneration of PCs observed in SCAs. Thus, we suggest that similar pathogenic mechanisms contribute the loss of PCs in NPC1.
Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old man with progressive cognitive decline, ataxia, and dystonia. Extensive laboratory, radiographic, and targeted genetic studies over the course of several years failed to yield a diagnosis. Initial whole exome sequencing through a commercial laboratory identified several variants of uncertain significance; however, follow-up clinical examination and testing ruled each of these out. Eventually, repeat whole exome sequencing identified a known pathogenic intronic variant in the NPC1 gene (NM_000271.4, c.1554-1009G&gt;A) and an additional heterozygous exonic variant of uncertain significance in the NPC1 gene (NM_000271.4, c.2524T&gt;C). Follow-up biochemical testing was consistent with a diagnosis of probable Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NP-C). This case illustrates the potential of whole exome sequencing for diagnosing rare complex neurologic diseases. It also identifies several potential common pitfalls that must be navigated by clinicians when interpreting commercial whole exome sequencing results.
Erythrocyte volume regulation and membrane elasticity are essential for adaptation to osmotic and mechanical stress, and life span. Here, we evaluated whether defective cholesterol trafficking caused by the rare lysosomal storages diseases (LSDs), Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency (LALD) impairs these properties. Moreover, we tested whether measurements of cholesterol membrane content and osmotic resistance serve as a screening test for these LSDs.
Patients were genotyped for mutations in NPC1, NPC2, or LIPA genes. We measured LSD plasma biomarkers and LAL activity. Red blood cells (RBC) membrane cholesterol content was evaluated in 73 subjects. Osmotic resistance tests (ORT) were conducted in 121 blood samples from LSD suspected patients and controls.
We did not find statistically significant differences between RBC cholesterol content between subjects and controls. However, the ORT, particularly at 0.49% (w/v) hypotonic sodium chloride solution, revealed a significant higher osmotic resistance in LSDs patients than in controls. We established a cut-off value of ≤51% of haemolysis with sensibility and specificity values of 80% and 70%, respectively.
NPC and LALD do not alter cholesterol content in the RBC membrane but increase osmotic resistance. Therefore, ORT serves as screening test for the studied LSDs.
We have tested the efficacy of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) delivered by the nasal route in the mouse model of juvenile Niemann-Pick C1 disease (NPC1), as pulmonary disease has not responded to systemic therapy with this drug. Since mice have no gag reflex, coating of the nasal cavity, with possible access to the brain, would be followed by delivery of HPBCD to the lung. While foamy macrophages, containing stored cholesterol, were found in the Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice, a marked inflammatory response was found with inhaled HPBCD, both in mutant and wild-type animals. Slight inflammation also occasionally occurred with saline inhalation. There was no difference between the saline-treated, HPBCD-treated, and untreated Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice for weight, balance beam performance, or coat hanger performance. Interestingly, there was a trend to longer survival in the HPBCD-treated Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice, which, when combined with the survival times of the saline-treated survivals (each of which was not different), became significant.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a rare neurovisceral disorder caused by mutations of either NPC1 or NPC2 gene and characterized by defective intracellular transport of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, leading to neuron loss and myelin aberration in the central nervous system. In this study, by comparing protein expression in the cortical white matter tracts from mice at different postnatal days, we identified that in the NPC1 mutant (NPC1-/-) mice, the onset of myelination is delayed and the amount of the major myelin protein MBP and PLP, and oligodendrocyte regulatory factor Olig1 and Olig2, but not NG2 and Sox10, decreased significantly, suggesting a disruption of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, in in vitro oligodendrocyte cultivation, NPC1-/- oligodendrocytes showed less response to the stimulation of neuron-conditioned medium (CdM), indicating a defect of oligodendrocyte per se. Interestingly, lovastatin restores the number of mature myelin-forming oligodendrocytes by increasing Olig1 and Olig2 expressions. Our data suggest a potential strategy for improving myelination using lovastatin in NPC disease.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of NPC1 gene function, which leads to severe neuroinflammation such as astrogliosis. While reports demonstrating neuroinflammation are prevalent in NP-C, information about the onset and progression of cerebellar astrogliosis in this disorder is lacking. Using gene targeting, we generated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) conditional null mutant mice. Deletion of VEGF in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PNs) led to a significant increase of astrogliosis in the brain of NP-C mice in addition to the loss of PNs, suggesting PN-derived VEGF as an important factor in NP-C pathology. Moreover, replenishment of VEGF in neurons improved brain pathology in NP-C mice. Overall, our data provide a new pathological perspective on cerebellar astrogliosis in NP-C and suggest the importance of VEGF as a therapeutic target for this disease.

Objective: To analyze the clinical manifestations, therapeutic efficacy, prognosis and characteristics of NPC1 mutation in Chinese patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C(NPC). Methods: Ten unrelated Chinese NPC patients were diagnosed by NPC1 mutation analysis from July 2013 to February 2017 in Beijing Tian Tan Hospital of Capital Medical University. Clinical data of 10 cases were analyzed retrospectively which included clinical manifestations, laboratory results and NPC1 gene mutation features, and a series of follow-up were carried out about therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. Results: Ten patients suffering from NPC included 5 males and 5 females, aged from 42 days to 14 years when they presented to Tian Tan Hospital. According to their age of neurological onset, 4 were in early infantile period, 2 in late infantile period, 2 in juvenile periods, and the other 2 cases in neonatal period. They all presented with splenomegaly, 5 of 10 accompanied with hepatomegaly. Two cases of neonatal subtype presented mainly with delayed neonatal cholestatic jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly, accompanied with decreased muscle tone and slight psychomotor retardation. The other 8 cases presented with severe neurological involvement, such as progressive encephalopathy, ataxia and language impairment, 4 with dystonia, 3 with decreased muscle tension, 5 with vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, 5 with gelastic cataplexy, and 4 with epilepsy. Eight of 9 cases presented with foam cells in their bone marrow. Head MRI showed diffuse cerebral atrophy in 8 cases, thin corpus callosum in 2 cases, and brain white matter abnormal signals in 2 cases. Among 10 cases, 18 different mutations of NPC1 allelic genes were identified including 11 reported mutations, 3 novel missense mutations: c. 3683T&gt;C (p.Met1128Thr), c.1926G&gt;C (p.Met642Iie) and c. 3006C&gt;G (p.Phe1002Leu), 2 novel nonsense mutation: c. 1142G&gt;A(p.Trp381Ter ) and c. 3229C&gt;T(p.Arg1077Ter), 1 novel minimal deletion mutation: c. 1385-1386del, and 1 novel intron mutation: c. 1757+ 5G&gt;A. In 5 cases, the symptom of gelastic cataplexy was alleviated by imipramine, and the convulsion was relieved by valproate in 2 cases, by carbamazepine in 1 case at the beginning of seizure. During the 25 (3-66) months of follow-up, 4 cases died, the others' neurological symptoms were deteriorated progressively. Conclusions: The NPC1 gene mutation were high heterozygous in this group, and 7 novel mutations enriched the gene mutation spectrum of NPC1. The neurological manifestations were complicated in patients with NPC, and the symptomatology would be different according to their onset age of neurological symptoms. There might be effective symptomatic treatment for gelastic cataplexy by imipramine and for convulsion by valproate or carbamazepine.

Increasing evidence implicates lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including the rare inherited lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD). Although the triggers of the lysosomal impairment may involve the accumulated macromolecules or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzymes, the role of the lysosomal glycocalyx in the lysosomal (dys)function has not been studied. The goal of this work was to analyze whether there are changes in the lysosomal glycocalyx in a cellular model of a LSD Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC). Using the ferrofluid nanoparticles we isolated lysosomal organelles from NPC1-null and CHOwt cells. The magnetically isolated lysosomal fractions were enriched with the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1 and showed the key features of NPC disease: 3-fold higher cholesterol content and 4-5 fold enlarged size of the particles compared with the lysosomal fractions of wt cells. These lysosomal fractions were further processed to isolate lysosomal membrane proteins using Triton X-114 and their N-glycome was analyzed by HILIC-UPLC. N-glycans presented in each chromatographic peak were elucidated using MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. We detected changes in the N-glycosylation pattern of the lysosomal glycocalyx of NPC1-null versus wt cells which involved high-mannose and sialylated N-glycans. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to report N-glycome profiling of the lysosomal glycocalyx in NPC disease cellular model and the first to report the specific changes in the lysosomal glycocalyx in NPC1-null cells. We speculate that changes in the lysosomal glycocalyx may contribute to lysosomal (dys)function. Further glycome profiling of the lysosomal glycocalyx in other LSDs as well as the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD, is necessary to better understand the role of the lysosomal glycocalyx and to reveal its potential contribution in lysosomal dysfunction leading to neurodegeneration.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and early death. NPC is caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Impaired NPC function leads to defective intracellular transport of unesterified cholesterol and its accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes. A high frequency of Crohn disease has been reported in NPC1 patients, suggesting that gastrointestinal tract pathology may become a more prominent clinical issue if effective therapies are developed to slow the neurodegeneration. The Npc1 nih mouse model on a BALB/c background replicates the hepatic and neurological disease observed in NPC1 patients. Thus, we sought to characterize the gastrointestinal tract pathology in this model to determine whether it can serve as a model of Crohn disease in NPC1.
We analyzed the gastrointestinal tract and isolated macrophages of BALB/cJ cNctr-Npc1m1N/J (Npc1-/-) mouse model to determine whether there was any Crohn-like pathology or inflammatory cell activation. We also evaluated temporal changes in the microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples to determine whether there were changes consistent with Crohn disease.
Relative to controls, Npc1 mutant mice demonstrate increased inflammation and crypt abscesses in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the observed pathological changes are significantly less than those observed in other Crohn disease mouse models. Analysis of Npc1 mutant macrophages demonstrated an increased response to lipopolysaccharides and delayed bactericidal activity; both of which are pathological features of Crohn disease. Analysis of the bacterial microbiota does not mimic what is reported in Crohn disease in either human or mouse models. We did observe significant increases in cyanobacteria and epsilon-proteobacteria. The increase in epsilon-proteobacteria may be related to altered cholesterol homeostasis since cholesterol is known to promote growth of this bacterial subgroup.
Macrophage dysfunction in the BALB/c Npc1-/- mouse is similar to that observed in other Crohn disease models. However, neither the degree of pathology nor the microbiota changes are typical of Crohn disease. Thus, this mouse model is not a good model system for Crohn disease pathology reported in NPC1 patients.
The feline model of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) recapitulates the clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical abnormalities present in children with NPC1. The hallmarks of disease are the lysosomal storage of unesterified cholesterol and multiple sphingolipids in neurons, and the spatial and temporal distribution of Purkinje cell death. In feline NPC1 brain, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) accumulations, indicating autophagosomes, were found within axons and presynaptic terminals. High densities of accumulated LC3 were seen in subdivisions of the inferior olive, which project to cerebellar regions that show the most Purkinje cell loss, suggesting that autophagic abnormalities in specific climbing fibers may contribute to the spatial pattern of Purkinje cell loss seen. Biweekly intrathecal administration of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta cyclodextrin (HPβCD) ameliorated neurological dysfunction, reduced cholesterol and sphingolipid accumulation, and increased lifespan in NPC1 cats. LC3 pathology was reduced in treated animals suggesting that HPβCD administration also ameliorates autophagic abnormalities. This study is the first to (i) identify specific brain regions exhibiting autophagic abnormalities in any species with NPC1, (ii) provide evidence of differential vulnerability among discrete brain nuclei and pathways, and (iii) show the amelioration of these abnormalities in NPC1 cats treated with HPβCD.
The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein regulates the transport of cholesterol and fatty acids from late endosomes/lysosomes and has a central role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. NPC1 loss-of-function mutations in humans cause NPC1 disease, a rare autosomal-recessive lipid-storage disorder characterized by progressive and lethal neurodegeneration, as well as liver and lung failure, due to cholesterol infiltration. In humans, genome-wide association studies and post-genome-wide association studies highlight the implication of common variants in NPC1 in adult-onset obesity, body fat mass, and type 2 diabetes. Heterozygous human carriers of rare loss-of-function coding variants in NPC1 display an increased risk of morbid adult obesity. These associations have been confirmed in mice models, showing an important interaction with high-fat diet. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge for NPC1 variants in relationship to pleiotropic effects on metabolism. We provide evidence that NPC1 gene variations may predispose to common metabolic diseases by modulating steroid hormone synthesis and/or lipid homeostasis. We also propose several important directions of research to further define the complex roles of NPC1 in metabolism. This review emphasizes the contribution of NPC1 to obesity and its metabolic complications.
Since their first identification 50 years ago, marburgviruses have emerged several times, with 83%-90% lethality in the largest outbreaks. Although no vaccines or therapeutics are available for human use, the human antibody MR191 provides complete protection in non-human primates when delivered several days after inoculation of a lethal marburgvirus dose. The detailed neutralization mechanism of MR191 remains outstanding. Here we present a 3.2 Å crystal structure of MR191 complexed with a trimeric marburgvirus surface glycoprotein (GP). MR191 neutralizes by occupying the conserved receptor-binding site and competing with the host receptor Niemann-Pick C1. The structure illuminates previously disordered regions of GP including the stalk, fusion loop, CX6CC switch, and an N-terminal region of GP2 that wraps about the outside of GP1 to anchor a marburgvirus-specific "wing" antibody epitope. Virus escape mutations mapped far outside the MR191 receptor-binding site footprint suggest a role for these other regions in the GP quaternary structure.
The non-specific phospholipase C (NPC) is a new member of the plant phospholipase family that reacts to abiotic environmental stresses, such as phosphate deficiency, high salinity, heat and aluminium toxicity, and is involved in root development, silicon distribution and brassinolide signalling. Six NPC genes (NPC1-NPC6) are found in the Arabidopsis genome. The NPC2 isoform has not been experimentally characterized so far.
The Arabidopsis NPC2 isoform was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. NPC2 enzyme activity was determined using fluorescent phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. Tissue expression and subcellular localization were analysed using GUS- and GFP-tagged NPC2. The expression patterns of NPC2 were analysed via quantitative real-time PCR. Independent homozygous transgenic plant lines overexpressing NPC2 under the control of a 35S promoter were generated, and reactive oxygen species were measured using a luminol-based assay.
The heterologously expressed protein possessed phospholipase C activity, being able to hydrolyse phosphatidylcholine to diacylglycerol. NPC2 tagged with GFP was predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis roots. The level of NPC2 transcript is rapidly altered during plant immune responses and correlates with the activation of multiple layers of the plant defence system. Transcription of NPC2 decreased substantially after plant infiltration with Pseudomonas syringae, flagellin peptide flg22 and salicylic acid treatments and expression of the effector molecule AvrRpm1. The decrease in NPC2 transcript levels correlated with a decrease in NPC2 enzyme activity. NPC2-overexpressing mutants showed higher reactive oxygen species production triggered by flg22.
This first experimental characterization of NPC2 provides new insights into the role of the non-specific phospholipase C protein family. The results suggest that NPC2 is involved in the response of Arabidopsis to P. syringae attack.
Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are characterized by the accumulation of diverse lipid species in lysosomes. Niemann-Pick type A/B (NPA/B) and type C diseases Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) are progressive LSD caused by loss of function of distinct lysosomal-residing proteins, acid sphingomyelinase and NPC1, respectively. While the primary cause of these diseases differs, both share common biochemical features, including the accumulation of sphingolipids and cholesterol, predominantly in endolysosomes. Besides these alterations in lysosomal homeostasis and function due to accumulation of specific lipid species, the lysosomal functional defects can have far-reaching consequences, disrupting intracellular trafficking of sterols, lipids and calcium through membrane contact sites (MCS) of apposed compartments. Although MCS between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been well studied and characterized in different contexts, emerging evidence indicates that lysosomes also exhibit close proximity with mitochondria, which translates in their mutual functional regulation. Indeed, as best illustrated in NPC disease, alterations in the lysosomal-mitochondrial liaisons underlie the secondary accumulation of specific lipids, such as cholesterol in mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and defective antioxidant defense, which contribute to disease progression. Thus, a better understanding of the lysosomal and mitochondrial interactions and trafficking may identify novel targets for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease.
This is the first study to objectively measure gait, balance, and upper limb coordination in a group of patients with NPC1 and compare the results to age and gender matched controls. This is also the first study to report effect sizes in these measures. Spatiotemporal gait analysis, static and dynamic posturography, and upper limb reaching motion analysis were performed. The findings showed that the NPC1 subjects had statistically significant deficits on 12 out of the 16 parameters investigated compared to controls, and large effect sizes for all but 1 parameter. When ranking the variables in terms of the effect sizes, the top 5 included at least 1 parameter from each of the 3 motor domains investigated. These results can provide insight to clinical researchers on the selection of outcome measures for longitudinal and interventional studies.
Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that can rapidly metastasize to become fatal, if not diagnosed early. Despite recent therapeutic advances, management of melanoma remains difficult. Therefore, novel molecular targets and strategies are required to manage this neoplasm. This study was undertaken to determine the role of the sirtuin SIRT6 in melanoma. Employing a panel of human melanoma cells and normal human melanocytes, we found significant SIRT6 mRNA and protein upregulation in melanoma cells. Further, using a tissue microarray coupled with quantitative Vectra analysis, we demonstrated significant SIRT6 overexpression in human melanoma tissues. Lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT6 in A375 and Hs 294T human melanoma cells significantly decreased cell growth, viability, and colony formation, induced G1-phase arrest and increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining. As autophagy is important in melanoma and is associated with SIRT6, we used a qPCR array to study SIRT6 knockdown in A375 cells. We found significant modulation in several genes and/or proteins (decreases in AKT1, ATG12, ATG3, ATG7, BAK1, BCL2L1, CLN3, CTSB, CTSS, DRAM2, HSP90AA1, IRGM, NPC1, SQSTM1, TNF, and BECN1; increases in GAA, ATG10). Our data suggests that increased SIRT6 expression may contribute to melanoma development and/or progression, potentially via senescence-and autophagy-related pathways.
The Npc1nmf164 allele of Npc1 provides a mouse model for Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a genetic disease known to have a widely variable phenotype. The transfer of the Npc1nmf164 mutation from the C57BL/6J inbred strain to the BALB/cJ inbred strain increased the mean lifespan from 117.8days to 153.1days, confirming that the severity of the NPC1 phenotype is strongly influenced by genetic background. The transfer of another Npc1 allele, Npc1nih, to this background also extended survival of the homozygotes indicating that the modifying effect of BALB/cJ is not limited to a single allele of Npc1. The increased longevity due to the BALB/cJ background did not map to a previously mapped modifier on chromosome 19, indicating the presence of additional genes impacting disease severity. The previously studied Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein promoter-Npc1 cDNA transgene (GFAP-Npc1) which only expresses NPC1 in astrocytes further extended the lifespan of Npc1nmf164 homozygotes on a BALB/cJ background (up to 600days). Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) treatment, not previously tested in the Npc1nmf164 mutant, extended life in the Npc1nmf164 homozygotes but not the transgenic, Npc1nmf164 mice on the BALB/cJ background. In all cases, lack of weight gain and early cerebellar symptoms of loss of motor control were found. At termination, the one mouse sacrificed for histological studies showed severe, diffuse pulmonary alveolar proteinosis suggesting that pulmonary abnormalities in NPC1 mouse models are not unique to the Npc1nih allele.
Niemann⁻Pick type C (NPC) disease is a rare neurovisceral cholesterol storage disorder that arises from loss of function mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes. Soon after birth, some patients present with an aggressive hepatosplenomegaly and cholestatic signs. Histopathologically, the liver presents with large numbers of foam cells; however, their role in disease pathogenesis has not been explored in depth. Here, we studied the consequences of gadolinium chloride (GdCl₃) treatment, a well-known Kupffer/foam cell inhibitor, at late stages of NPC liver disease and compared it with NPC1 genetic rescue in hepatocytes in vivo. GdCl₃ treatment successfully blocked the endocytic capacity of hepatic Kupffer/foam measured by India ink endocytosis, decreased the levels CD68-A marker of Kupffer cells in the liver-and normalized the transaminase levels in serum of NPC mice to a similar extent to those obtained by genetic Npc1 rescue of liver cells. Gadolinium salts are widely used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts. This study opens the possibility of targeting foam cells with gadolinium or by other means for improving NPC liver disease. Synopsis: Gadolinium chloride can effectively rescue some parameters of liver dysfunction in NPC mice and its potential use in patients should be carefully evaluated.
We previously demonstrated that the direct transplantation of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) into the dentate gyrus ameliorated the neurological symptoms of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1)-mutant mice. However, the clinical presentation of NPC1-mutant mice was not fully understood with a molecular mechanism. Here, we found 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET), a cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolite, from hUCB-MSCs and the cerebella of NPC1-mutant mice and investigated the functional consequence of this metabolite. Our screening of the CYP2J family indicated a dysregulation in the CYP system in a cerebellar-specific manner. Moreover, in Purkinje cells, CYP2J6 showed an elevated expression level compared to that of astrocytes, granule cells, and microglia. In this regard, we found that one CYP metabolite, 14,15-EET, acts as a key mediator in ameliorating cholesterol accumulation. In confirming this hypothesis, 14,15-EET treatment reduced the accumulation of cholesterol in human NPC1 patient-derived fibroblasts in vitro by suppressing cholesterol synthesis and ameliorating the impaired autophagic flux. We show that the reduced activity within the CYP system in the cerebellum could cause the neurological symptoms of NPC1 patients, as 14,15-EET treatment significantly rescued cholesterol accumulation and impaired autophagy. We also provide evidence that the intranasal administration of hUCB-MSCs is a highly promising alternative to traumatic surgical transplantation for NPC1 patients.
Olfactory impairment is one of the earliest symptoms in neurodegenerative disorders that has also been documented in Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1). NPC1 is a very rare, neurovisceral lipid storage disorder, characterized by a deficiency of Npc1 gene function that leads to progressive neurodegeneration. Here, we compared the pathologic effect of defective Npc1 gene on the vomeronasal neuroepithelium (VNE) with that of the olfactory epithelium (OE) in an NPC1 mouse model.
Proliferation in the VNE and OE was assessed by applying a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) protocol. We further compared the immunoreactivities of anti-olfactory marker protein (OMP), and the lysosomal marker cathepsin-D in both epithelia. To investigate if degenerative effects of both olfactory systems can be prevented or reversed, some animals were treated with a combination of miglustat/allopregnanolone/2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), or a monotherapy with HPβCD alone.
Using BrdU to label dividing cells of the VNE, we detected a proliferation increase of 215% ± 12% in Npc1-/- mice, and 270% ± 10% in combination- treated Npc1-/- animals. The monotherapy with HPβCD led to an increase of 261% ± 10.5% compared to sham-treated Npc1-/- mice. Similar to the OE, we assessed the high regenerative potential of vomeronasal progenitor cells. OMP reactivity in the VNE of Npc1-/- mice was not affected, in contrast to that observed in the OE. Concomitantly, cathepsin-D reactivity in the VNE was virtually absent. Conclusion: Vomeronasal receptor neurons are less susceptible against NPC1 pathology than olfactory receptor neurons. Compared to control mice, however, the VNE of Npc1-/- mice displays an increased neuroregenerative potential, indicating compensatory cell renewal.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in endolysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Clinically, NPC1 manifests as cholestatic liver disease in the newborn or as a progressive neurogenerative condition characterized by cerebellar ataxia and cognitive decline. Currently there are no FDA approved therapies for NPC1. Thus, understanding the pathological processes that contribute to neurodegeneration will be important in both developing and testing potential therapeutic interventions. Neuroinflammation and necroptosis contribute to the NPC1 pathological cascade. Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3), are protein kinases that play a central role in mediating neuronal necroptosis. Our prior work suggested that pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 had a significant but modest beneficial effect; however, the inhibitors used in that study had suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties. In this work we evaluated both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity. Lifespan in both Npc1-/- mice treated with GSK'547, a RIPK1 inhibitor with better pharmacokinetic properties, and Npc1-/-:Ripk1kd/kd double mutant mice was significantly increased. In both cases the increase in lifespan was modest, suggesting that the therapeutic potential of RIPK1 inhibition, as a monotherapy, is limited. We thus investigated the potential of combining RIPK1 inhibition with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) therapy HPβCD has been shown to slow neurological disease progression in NPC1 mice, cats and patients. HPβCD appeared to have an additive positive effect on the pathology and survival of Npc1-/-:Ripk1kd/kd mice. RIPK1 and RIPK3 are both critical components of the necrosome, thus we were surprised to observe no increase survival in Npc1-/-;Ripk3-/- mice compared to Npc1-/- mice. These data suggest that although necroptosis is occurring in NPC1, the observed effects of RIPK1 inhibition may be related to its RIPK3-independent role in neuroinflammation and cytokine production.
Niemann Pick type C (NPC) lysosomal disorder is linked to the disruption of cholesterol transport. Recent data suggest that the molecular background of this disease is more complex. It was found that accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of NPC1 cells may affect mitochondrial functions.
In this study, primary skin fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of two anonymous patients with NPC-carrying mutations in the NPC1 gene, characterized by a high total cholesterol content, as well as two healthy donors were used. The presence of signaling proteins in the whole cell lysates and mitochondrial fractions were examined by Western blotting assay.
In this report, we provide experimental evidence that in NPC1 cells, dysfunction of mitochondria and cellular metabolism, as reported by Wos et al in 2016, coexist with alterations in signal transduction pathways, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, glycogen synthase kinase-3 β, and Jun amino-terminal kinase, leading to abnormal cholesterol accumulation and distribution.
Differences in signal transduction between control and NPC1 cells may suggest that the latter cells experienced significant alterations in the complex molecular mechanisms that control cellular energy metabolism and vesicular transport.
Intestinal NPC1L1 transporter is essential for cholesterol absorption and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis in the body. NPC1L1 is differentially expressed along the gastrointestinal tract with very low levels in the colon as compared with the small intestine. This study was undertaken to examine whether DNA methylation was responsible for segment-specific expression of NPC1L1. Treatment of mice with 5-azacytidine (i.p.) resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in NPC1L1 mRNA expression in the colon. The lack of expression of NPC1L1 in the normal colon was associated with high levels of methylation in the area flanking the 3-kb fragment upstream of the initiation site of the mouse NPC1L1 gene in mouse colon as analyzed by EpiTYPER® MassARRAY®. The high level of methylation in the colon was observed in specific CpG dinucleotides and was significantly decreased in response to 5-azacytidine. Similar to mouse NPC1L1, 5-azacytidine treatment also increased the level of human NPC1L1 mRNA expression in the intestinal HuTu-80 cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Silencing the expression of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, -2, -3A, and -3B alone by siRNA did not affect NPC1L1 expression in HuTu-80 cells. However, the simultaneous attenuation of DNMT1 and -3B expression caused a significant increase in NPC1L1 mRNA expression as compared with control. Also, in vitro methylation of the human NPC1L1 promoter significantly decreased NPC1L1 promoter activity in human intestinal Caco2 cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated for the first time that DNA methylation in the promoter region of the NPC1L1 gene appears to be a major mechanism underlying differential expression of NPC1L1 along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. 
We selected twenty genes from the "Top Results" list on the AlzGene database website and assessed their association with risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a large, genome-wide association study (using 526 SNPs from 2,032 AD cases and 5,328 controls) performed in France. The APOE, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 loci were excluded, since they had already been extensively analyzed. Ten genes/loci (TFAM, SORL1, CHRNB2, SORCS1, DAPK1, MTHFR, GWA 14q32.13, BDNF, NEDD9, and CH25H) showed weak nominal association with AD risk, in line with previous studies. In the remaining ten genes/loci (TNK1, ACE, CST3, IL1B, hCG2039140, PRNP, GAB2, LOC651924, IL1A, and TF), no single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated in our dataset. Of the genes showing nominal association in our cohorts, TFAM and CHRNB2 appear particularly interesting and warrant further genetic and functional follow-up analyses.
The genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous and remains only ill-defined. We have recently created a freely available and continuously updated online database (AlzGene; http://www.alzgene.org ) for which we collect all published genetic association studies in AD and perform systematic meta-analyses on all polymorphisms with sufficient genotype data. In this study, we tested 27 genes (ACE, BDNF, CH25H, CHRNB2, CST3, CTSD, DAPK1, GALP, hCG2039140, IL1B, LMNA, LOC439999, LOC651924, MAPT, MTHFR, MYH13, PCK1, PGBD1, PRNP, PSEN1, SORCS1, SORL1, TF, TFAM, TNK1, GWA_14q32.13, and GWA_7p15.2), all showing significant association with AD risk in the AlzGene meta-analyses, in a large collection of family-based samples comprised of 4,180 subjects from over 1,300 pedigrees. Overall, we observe significant association with risk for AD and polymorphisms in ACE, CHRNB2, TF, and an as yet uncharacterized locus on chromosome 7p15.2 [rs1859849]. For all four loci, the association was observed with the same alleles as in the AlzGene meta-analyses. The convergence of case-control and family-based findings suggests that these loci currently represent the most promising AD gene candidates. Further fine-mapping and functional analyses are warranted to elucidate the potential biochemical mechanisms and epidemiological relevance of these genes.
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, with a complex etiology. APOE is the only confirmed susceptibility gene for LOAD. Others remain yet to be found. Evidence from linkage studies suggests that a gene (or genes) conferring susceptibility for LOAD resides on chromosome 10. We studied 23 positional/functional candidate genes from our linkage region on chromosome 10 (APBB1IP, ALOX5, AD037, SLC18A3, DKK1, ZWINT, ANK3, UBE2D1, CDC2, SIRT1, JDP1, NET7, SUPV3L1, NEN3, SAR1, SGPL1, SEC24C, CAMK2G, PP3CB, SNCG, CH25H, PLCE1, ANXV111) in the MRC genetic resource for LOAD. These candidates were screened for sequence polymorphisms in a sample of 14 LOAD subjects and detected polymorphisms tested for association with LOAD in a three-stage design involving two stages of genotyping pooled DNA samples followed by a third stage in which markers showing evidence for association in the first stages were subjected to individual genotyping. One hundred and twenty polymorphisms were identified and tested in stage 1 (4 case + 4 control pools totaling 366 case and 366 control individuals). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing evidence of association with LOAD were then studied in stage 2 (8 case + 4 control pools totaling 1,001 case and 1,001 control individuals). Five SNPs, in four genes, showed evidence for association (P &lt; 0.1) at stage 2 and were individually genotyped in the complete dataset, comprising 1,160 LOAD cases and 1,389 normal controls. Two SNPs in SGPL1 demonstrated marginal evidence of association, with uncorrected P values of 0.042 and 0.056, suggesting that variation in SGPL1 may confer susceptibility to LOAD.
Polymorphic genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (see ) delineate a clearly defined pathway related to cerebral and peripheral cholesterol and lipoprotein homoeostasis. They include all of the key components of a glia/neurone cholesterol shuttle including cholesterol binding lipoproteins APOA1, APOA4, APOC1, APOC2, APOC3, APOD, APOE and LPA, cholesterol transporters ABCA1, ABCA2, lipoprotein receptors LDLR, LRP1, LRP8 and VLDLR, and the cholesterol metabolising enzymes CYP46A1 and CH25H, whose oxysterol products activate the liver X receptor NR1H2 and are metabolised to esters by SOAT1. LIPA metabolises cholesterol esters, which are transported by the cholesteryl ester transport protein CETP. The transcription factor SREBF1 controls the expression of most enzymes of cholesterol synthesis. APP is involved in this shuttle as it metabolises cholesterol to 7-betahydroxycholesterol, a substrate of SOAT1 and HSD11B1, binds to APOE and is tethered to LRP1 via APPB1, APBB2 and APBB3 at the cytoplasmic domain and via LRPAP1 at the extracellular domain. APP cleavage products are also able to prevent cholesterol binding to APOE. BACE cleaves both APP and LRP1. Gamma-secretase (PSEN1, PSEN2, NCSTN) cleaves LRP1 and LRP8 as well as APP and their degradation products control transcription factor TFCP2, which regulates thymidylate synthase (TS) and GSK3B expression. GSK3B is known to phosphorylate the microtubule protein tau (MAPT). Dysfunction of this cascade, carved out by genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, may play a major role in its pathology. Many other genes associated with Alzheimer's disease affect cholesterol or lipoprotein function and/or have also been implicated in atherosclerosis, a feature of Alzheimer's disease, and this duality may well explain the close links between vascular and cerebral pathology in Alzheimer's disease. The definition of many of these genes as risk factors is highly contested. However, when polymorphic susceptibility genes belong to the same signaling pathway, the risk associated with multigenic disease is better related to the integrated effects of multiple polymorphisms of genes within the same pathway than to variants in any single gene [Wu, X., Gu, J., Grossman, H.B., Amos, C.I., Etzel, C., Huang, M., Zhang, Q., Millikan, R.E., Lerner, S., Dinney, C.P., Spitz, M.R., 2006. Bladder cancer predisposition: a multigenic approach to DNA-repair and cell-cycle-control genes. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 78, 464-479.]. Thus, the fact that Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes converge on a clearly defined signaling network has important implications for genetic association studies.
Abnormal structural alterations termed remodeling, including fibrosis and alveolar wall destruction, are important features of the pathophysiology of chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is enzymatically produced by cholesterol 25-hydorxylase (CH25H) in macrophages and is reported to be involved in the formation of arteriosclerosis. We previously demonstrated that the expression of CH25H and production of 25HC were increased in the lungs of COPD. However, the role of 25-HC in lung tissue remodeling is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of 25-HC on fibroblast-mediated tissue remodeling using human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) in vitro. 25-HC significantly augmented α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (P&lt;0.001) and collagen I (P&lt;0.001) expression in HFL-1. 25-HC also significantly enhanced the release and activation of matrix metallaoproteinase (MMP)-2 (P&lt;0.001) and MMP-9 (P&lt;0.001) without any significant effect on the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2. 25-HC stimulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 production (P&lt;0.01) and a neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody restored these 25-HC-augmented pro-fibrotic responses. 25-HC significantly promoted the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 into the nuclei (P&lt;0.01), but not phospholylated-c-jun, a complex of activator protein-1. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB restored the 25-HC-augmented pro-fibrotic responses and TGF-β1 release. These results suggest that 25-HC could contribute to fibroblast-mediated lung tissue remodeling by promoting myofibroblast differentiation and the excessive release of extracellular matrix protein and MMPs via an NF-κB-TGF-β dependent pathway.
To investigate the relationship between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and candidate gene polymorphisms in a Chinese population, 116 aMCI patients and 93 normal controls were recruited. Multi-dimensional neuropsychological tests were used to extensively assess the cognitive functions of the subjects. MassARRAY and iPLEX systems were used to measure candidate single nucleotide polymorohisms (SNPs) and analyse allelic, genotypic or haplotypic distributions. The scores of the neuropsychological tests were significantly lower for the aMCI patients than for the normal controls. The distributions of SNPs relating to the amyloid cascade hypothesis (TOMM40 rs157581 G and TOMM40 rs2075650 G), to the cholesterol metabolism hypothesis (ApoE rs429358 C, LDLR rs11668477 G and CH25H rs7091822 T and PLAU rs2227564 CT) and to the tau hypothesis (MAPT/STH rs242562 GG) in aMCI were significantly different than those in normal controls. Interactions were also found in aMCI amongst SNPs in LDLR rs11668477, PLAU rs2227564, and TOMM40 rs157581, between SNPs in TOMM40 rs157580 and BACE2 rs9975138. The study suggests that aMCI is characterised by memory impairment and associated with SNPs in three systems relating to the pathogenesis of AD--those of the amyloid cascade, tau and cholesterol metabolism pathways. Interactions were also observed between genes in the amyloid pathway and between the amyloid and cholesterol pathways.
High density SNP arrays can be used to identify DNA copy number changes in tumors such as homozygous deletions of tumor suppressor genes and focal amplifications of oncogenes. Illumina Human CNV370 Bead chip arrays were used to assess the genome for unbalanced chromosomal events occurring in 39 cell lines derived from stage III metastatic melanomas. A number of genes previously recognized to have an important role in the development and progression of melanoma were identified including homozygous deletions of CDKN2A (13 of 39 samples), CDKN2B (10 of 39), PTEN (3 of 39), PTPRD (3 of 39), TP53 (1 of 39), and amplifications of CCND1 (2 of 39), MITF (2 of 39), MDM2 (1 of 39), and NRAS (1 of 39). In addition, a number of focal homozygous deletions potentially targeting novel melanoma tumor suppressor genes were identified. Because of their likely functional significance for melanoma progression, FAS, CH25H, BMPR1A, ACTA2, and TFG were investigated in a larger cohort of melanomas through sequencing. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified in BMPR1A (1 of 43), ACTA2 (3 of 43), and TFG (5 of 103). A number of potentially important mutation events occurred in TFG including the identification of a mini mutation "hotspot" at amino acid residue 380 (P380S and P380L) and the presence of multiple mutations in two melanomas. Mutations in TFG may have important clinical relevance for current therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic melanoma.
To examine the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery with and without laparoscopic removal of omental fat (omentectomy) on the temporal gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle.
Previously reported were the whole-body metabolic effects of a randomized, single-blinded study in patients receiving RYGB surgery stratified to receive or not receive omentectomy. In this follow up study we report on changes in skeletal muscle gene expression in a subset of 21 patients, for whom biopsies were collected preoperatively and at either 6 months or 12 months postoperatively.
RNA isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies of 21 subjects (8 without omentectomy and 13 with omentectomy) taken before RYGB or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were subjected to gene expression profiling via Exon 1.0 S/T Array and Taqman Low Density Array. Robust Multichip Analysis and gene enrichment data analysis revealed 84 genes with at least a 4-fold expression difference after surgery. At 6 and 12 months the RYGB with omentectomy group displayed a greater reduction in the expression of genes associated with skeletal muscle inflammation (ANKRD1, CDR1, CH25H, CXCL2, CX3CR1, IL8, LBP, NFIL3, SELE, SOCS3, TNFAIP3, and ZFP36) relative to the RYGB non-omentectomy group. Expressions of IL6 and CCL2 were decreased at all postoperative time points. There was differential expression of genes driving protein turnover (IGFN1, FBXW10) in both groups over time and increased expression of PAAF1 in the non-omentectomy group at 12 months. Evidence for the activation of skeletal muscle satellite cells was inferred from the up-regulation of HOXC10. The elevated post-operative expression of 22 small nucleolar RNAs and the decreased expression of the transcription factors JUNB, FOS, FOSB, ATF3 MYC, EGR1 as well as the orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3 suggest dramatic reorganizations at both the cellular and genetic levels.
These data indicate that RYGB reduces skeletal muscle inflammation, and removal of omental fat further amplifies this response.

The migrating schistosomulum is an important stage of the schistosome lifecycle and represents a key target for elimination of infection by natural and vaccine-induced host immune responses. To gain a better understanding of how schistosomes initiate a primary host immune response we have characterised the host lung response to migrating Schistosoma japonicum schistosomula using a combination of histopathology, microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Our findings indicate that the early pulmonary response to these migrating larvae is characteristic of innate inflammation and wound healing. This response is associated with significant up-regulation of several genes with immunoregulatory function including Ch25h, Hmox1 and Retnla which may act to control the nature or magnitude of the inflammatory response to the migrating schistosomula, promoting both parasite and host survival. These findings contribute to our understanding of host-parasite interactions associated with schistosome and, especially, S. japonicum infection, and may aid the future design of novel vaccines that target the lung stage schistosomulum.
The association of eosinophils with inflammation and tissue remodeling is at least partially due to their release of toxic granule proteins and other mediators, including cytokines. Tissue remodeling and consequent functional defects are affected by activity of connective tissue fibroblasts. Exaggerated fibroblast activation, accumulation and change of phenotype may lead to fibrosis and loss of tissue function. So far, little information has been reported on how eosinophils affect inflammation and tissue remodeling via the activation of fibroblasts. We have recently shown that eosinophil activation with IL-3 led to a robust eosinophil degranulation on immunoglobin-G (IgG) coated plates. Thus, in the present study, we analyze the effects of IL-3-activated eosinophil degranulation products on primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF) using whole transcriptome sequencing.
Conditioned media was obtained from eosinophils that were pre-activated with IL-3 or IL-5 and subsequently cultured for 6 h on IgG to induce degranulation. This conditioned media was added on human lung fibroblasts (HLF) for 24 h and the cell lysates were then subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing to identify global changes in gene expression. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and validated by qPCR.
In HLF, the expression level of 300 genes was changed by conditioned media from IL-3-activated eosinophils compared to control fibroblast cultures. Among these 300 genes, the expression level of 35 genes coding for known proteins was upregulated by IL-3- versus IL-5-pre-activated eosinophils. Of the 35 upregulated genes, IPA identified C3, CH25H, CXCL1, CXCL8, CYP1A1, ICAM1, IL6 and UCN2 as having downstream functions on inflammation, tissue remodeling and lipid synthesis. This analysis combined with previous RNA sequencing analyses of eosinophils suggest IL-1ß, OSM and TNFSF12 as potential upstream regulators of fibroblasts.
This study has identified several novel pro-inflammatory and pro-remodeling mediators produced by fibroblasts in response to activated eosinophils. These findings may have significant implications on the role of eosinophil/fibroblast interactions in eosinophilic disorders.
Dysfunction of microglia is known to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the role of RIPK1 in microglia mediating the pathogenesis of AD. RIPK1 is highly expressed by microglial cells in human AD brains. Using the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model, we found that inhibition of RIPK1, using both pharmacological and genetic means, reduced amyloid burden, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and memory deficits. Furthermore, inhibition of RIPK1 promoted microglial degradation of Aβ in vitro. We characterized the transcriptional profiles of adult microglia from APP/PS1 mice and identified a role for RIPK1 in regulating the microglial expression of CH25H and Cst7, a marker for disease-associated microglia (DAM), which encodes an endosomal/lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor named Cystatin F. We present evidence that RIPK1-mediated induction of Cst7 leads to an impairment in the lysosomal pathway. These data suggest that RIPK1 may mediate a critical checkpoint in the transition to the DAM state. Together, our study highlights a non-cell death mechanism by which the activation of RIPK1 mediates the induction of a DAM phenotype, including an inflammatory response and a reduction in phagocytic activity, and connects RIPK1-mediated transcription in microglia to the etiology of AD. Our results support that RIPK1 is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.
The rs17070145-T variant of the WWC1 gene, coding for the KIBRA protein, has been associated with both increased episodic memory performance and lowered risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease, although the mechanism behind this protective effect has not been completely elucidated. To achieve a better understanding of the pathways modulated by rs17070145 and its associated functional variant(s), we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-sequencing to investigate the effect of rs17070145 genotypes on whole transcriptome expression in the human hippocampus (HP) of 22 neuropathologically normal individuals, with a specific focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) and at the pyramidal cells (PC) of CA1 and CA3 sub-regions. Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data within the HP based on the rs17070145 genotype revealed an overexpression of genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, potentially driven by the T/T genotype. The most important contribution comes from genes dysregulated within the DG region. Other genes significantly dysregulated, and not involved in the MAPK pathway (Adj P &lt; 0.01 and Fold Change &gt; |1.00|) were: RSPO4 (HP); ARC, DUSP5, DNAJB5, EGR4, PPP1R15A, WBP11P1, EGR1, GADD45B (DG); CH25H, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, TNFSF9, and NPAS4 (PC). Several evidences suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway is linked with memory and learning processes. In non-neuronal cells, the KIBRA protein is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (involved in the MAPK signaling) in cells as well as in vitro. Several of the other dysregulated genes are involved in memory and learning processes, as well as in Alzheimer's Disease. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of the WWC1 rs17070145 polymorphism on memory performance and Alzheimer's disease might be due to a differential regulation of the MAPK signaling, a key pathway involved in memory and learning processes.
This study investigated whether gene expression levels of key modulators of the oxysterol signalling pathway modify the prognosis of patients with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast carcinomas via interaction with endocrine therapy.
The prognosis of patients with ER+ breast carcinoma depends on several factors. Previous studies have suggested that some oxygenated forms of cholesterol (oxysterols) bind to oestrogen receptor and anti-oestrogen binding site which may deregulate cholesterol homoeostasis and influence effect of therapy.
The expression levels of 70 oxysterol pathway genes were evaluated in a test set of breast carcinomas differing in ER expression. The genes differentially expressed in ER+ tumours were assessed in a comprehensive set of ER+ tumours to evaluate their clinical significance.
A total of 193 primary patients with breast carcinoma were included.
The transcript levels were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
The expression levels of 23 genes were found to be specifically dysregulated in ER+ tumours compared to ER- tumours of the test set. The expression levels of ABCG2, CYP7B1, CYP24A1, CYP39A1 and CH25H genes were found to be strongly associated with disease stage; however, none of the gene expression levels were associated with disease-free survival in patients treated with endocrine therapy.
The expression of a number of oxysterol pathway genes is significantly modulated by ER expression and associated with the clinical stage of patients. However, the expression of oxysterol pathway genes was not found to modify the prognosis of ER+ patients with breast carcinoma treated with endocrine therapy.
Arrival of encephalitogenic T cells at inflammatory foci represents a critical step in development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for multiple sclerosis. EBI2 and its ligand, 7α,25-OHC, direct immune cell localization in secondary lymphoid organs. CH25H and CYP7B1 hydroxylate cholesterol to 7α,25-OHC. During EAE, we found increased expression of CH25H by microglia and CYP7B1 by CNS-infiltrating immune cells elevating the ligand concentration in the CNS. Two critical pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), maintained expression of EBI2 in differentiating Th17 cells. In line with this, EBI2 enhanced early migration of encephalitogenic T cells into the CNS in a transfer EAE model. Nonetheless, EBI2 was dispensable in active EAE. Human Th17 cells do also express EBI2, and EBI2 expressing cells are abundant within multiple sclerosis (MS) white matter lesions. These findings implicate EBI2 as a mediator of CNS autoimmunity and describe mechanistically its contribution to the migration of autoreactive T cells into inflamed organs.
Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression. Endogenous viruses integrate into host genomes and can recombine with exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV). In this study, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous retrovirus 21 (ev21) with the ALV-J in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken. Two ALV-J strains M180 and K243 were isolated from late-feathering and fast-feathering Chinese yellow chicken flocks, respectively. The env gene of the two strains showed 94.2-94.8% nucleotide identity with reference ALV-J strains. Compared with the env gene and the LTR of ev21 and M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively, especially the amino acid identity of env gene as low as 14.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the 3'LTR showed that M180 was closely related to ALV-J, and was located in a distinct group with ev21 in the phylogenetic tree. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), we next demonstrate that the envelope protein of ev21 does not interact with the M180 envelope protein. We further show that the envelope protein of ev21 cannot activate ALV-J LTR promoter activity using luciferase-reporter assays. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection (hpi) and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. However, the expression of the env gene of M180 strain was not significantly at 6 and 24 hpi. We conclude that there is no evidence of recombination between endogenous retrovirus ev21 and ALV-J strain M180 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken, and envelope protein of ev21 can affect the expression of host ISGs, but appears not to influence the replication of ALV-J strain M180. This is the first report of interaction among the endogenous retrovirus ev21, ALV-J and the late-feathering chicken.
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a severe respiratory disease that leads to huge economic losses in the pig industry throughout the world. Although there are several vaccines available, the protective efficacy is limited. Therefore, new control strategies to prevent PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection are urgently required. We have previously reported that CH25H and 25HC can significantly inhibit the replication of PRRSV by preventing viral entry. In the present study, we found that 25HC with a low IC50 value significantly decreased the replication of different PRRSV strains, and increased the production of IL-1β and IL-8 in porcine primary alveolar macrophages and the lung tissue. In pigs challenged with highly pathogenic PRRSV, treatment with 25HC was associated with an obvious reduction in the level of viremia and viral load in lung samples and nasal swabs, as well as decreased lung injury and an increased survival rate. These findings suggest that 25HC could be a promising antiviral drug against PRRSV in the future.
It is not clear how hepatitis B virus (HBV) modulates host immunity during chronic infection. In addition to the key mediators of inflammatory response in viral infection, monocytes also express a high-level IFN-stimulated gene, CH25H, upon response to IFN-α exerting an antiviral effect. In this study, the mechanism by which HBV manipulates IFN signaling in human monocytes was investigated. We observed that monocytes from chronic hepatitis B patients express lower levels of IFN signaling/stimulated genes and higher levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with healthy donors. HBV induces monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines via TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling and STAT1-Ser727 phosphorylation and inhibits IFN-α-induced stat1, stat2, and ch25h expression through the inhibition of STAT1-Tyr701 phosphorylation and in an IL-10-dependent, partially autocrine manner. Further, we found that enhancement of STAT1 activity with a small molecule (2-NP) rescued HBV-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling and counteracted the induction of inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, HBV contributes to the monocyte inflammatory response but inhibits their IFN-α/β responsiveness to impair antiviral innate immunity. These effects are mediated via differential phosphorylation of Tyr701 and Ser727 of STAT1.
Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression in infected chickens. Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes' function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3α, IL-1β, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.
The gene encoding for Epstein-Barr virus-induced G-protein-coupled receptor 2 (EBI2) is a risk gene for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Together with its oxysterol ligand 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, EBI2 mediates migration and differentiation of immune cells. However, the role of EBI2 in the colonic immune system remains insufficiently studied. We found increased mRNA expression of EBI2 and oxysterol-synthesizing enzymes (CH25H, CYP7B1) in the inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis and mice with acute or chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis. Accordingly, we detected elevated levels of 25-hydroxylated oxysterols, including 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol in mice with acute colonic inflammation. Knockout of EBI2 or CH25H did not affect severity of DSS colitis; however, inflammation was decreased in male EBI2-/- mice in the IL-10 colitis model. The colonic immune system comprises mucosal lymphoid structures, which accumulate upon chronic inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice and in chronic DSS colitis. However, EBI2-/- mice formed significantly less colonic lymphoid structures at baseline and showed defects in inflammation-induced accumulation of lymphoid structures. In summary, we report induction of the EBI2-7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol axis in colitis and a role of EBI2 for the accumulation of lymphoid tissue during homeostasis and inflammation. These data implicate the EBI2-7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol axis in IBD pathogenesis.
Osteoarthritis-the most common form of age-related degenerative whole-joint disease1-is primarily characterized by cartilage destruction, as well as by synovial inflammation, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone remodelling2,3. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis are largely unknown. Although osteoarthritis is currently considered to be associated with metabolic disorders, direct evidence for this is lacking, and the role of cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis has not been fully investigated4-6. Various types of cholesterol hydroxylases contribute to cholesterol metabolism in extrahepatic tissues by converting cellular cholesterol to circulating oxysterols, which regulate diverse biological processes7,8. Here we show that the CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism in chondrocytes is a crucial catabolic regulator of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes had increased levels of cholesterol because of enhanced uptake, upregulation of cholesterol hydroxylases (CH25H and CYP7B1) and increased production of oxysterol metabolites. Adenoviral overexpression of CH25H or CYP7B1 in mouse joint tissues caused experimental osteoarthritis, whereas knockout or knockdown of these hydroxylases abrogated the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Moreover, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) was found to mediate the induction of osteoarthritis by alterations in cholesterol metabolism. These results indicate that osteoarthritis is a disease associated with metabolic disorders and suggest that targeting the CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism may provide a therapeutic avenue for treating osteoarthritis.
Numerous genetic evidence has pointed out that variations in cholesterol-related genes may be associated with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms in several cholesterol-related genes [APOA5 (rs662799), APOC1 (rs11568822), APOD (rs1568565), CH25H (rs13500), LDLR (rs5930), SORL1 (rs2282649)] and AD in a cohort of Turkish patients. The study group consisted of 257 AD patients (mean age: 75.9 years ± 10.4) and 414 controls (mean age: 62.2 years ± 13.1). Genotyping was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using hydrolysis probes. Our results showed that the 'TT' genotype of CH25H rs13500 polymorphism was significantly more frequent in the AD group (p &lt; 0.001) and individuals carrying the CH25H 'T' allele had an increased risk for AD (OR 3.07, 95% CI 2.13-4.44, p = 2.20e-09) independently from age, gender and APOE ε4 allele. Moreover, this risk was excessively increased (OR 14.04, 95% CI 6.99-28.23, p = 9.78e-14) in the presence of APOE ε4 allele. The 'ins/ins' genotype of APOC1 rs11568822 was significantly more frequent in the AD group compared to controls (p = 1.95e-08). However, this increased AD risk in 'ins/ins' carriers was found to be dependent on their APOE ε4 carrier status. No significant associations were found in allele and genotype distributions of APOA5, APOD, LDLR and SORL1 gene polymorphisms. Our results suggest that the association between APOC1 'ins/ins' genotype and AD risk can be explained by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE locus. CH25H rs13500 polymorphism is associated with an AD risk in the Turkish population and CH25H might have a role in the pathogenesis of AD together with, and independently from APOE.
Currently, research on genome-scale epigenetic modifications for studying the pathogenesis of lung cancer is lacking. Aberrant DNA methylation, as the most common and important modification in epigenetics, is an important means of regulating genomic function and can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In this paper, methylation information and gene expression data from patients with LUSC were extracted from the TCGA database. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were used to screen abnormally methylated genes related to the prognosis of LUSC. The relationship between key DNA methylation sites and the transcriptional expression of LUSC-related genes was explored. A prognostic risk model constructed by four abnormally methylated genes (VAX1, CH25H, AdCyAP1, and Irx1) was used to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients. Also, the methylation levels of the key gene IRX1 are significantly correlated with the prognosis and correlated with the methylation of the site cg09232937 and cg10530883. This study is based on high-throughput data mining and provides an effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and prognosis of LUSC, which has important theoretical significance for follow-up studies on LUSC.
Dihydroxycholesterols such as 7α,25-dihydroxysterols (7α,25-OHC) and 7α,27-OHC are generated from cholesterol by the enzymes CH25H, CYP7B1 and CYP27A1 in steady state but also in the context of inflammation. The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, senses these oxysterols and induces chemotactic migration of immune cells towards higher concentrations of these ligands. We recently showed that these ligands are upregulated in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis and that EBI2 enhanced early infiltration of encephalitogenic T cells into the CNS. In this short-review we discuss the role of dihydroxysterol-sensing by immune cells in neuroinflammation.
The development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis remains unclear, but emerging evidence supports a crucial role for inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in disease progression. Mechanisms underlying iBALT generation, particularly during chronic CS exposure, remain to be defined. Oxysterol metabolism of cholesterol is crucial to immune cell localization in secondary lymphoid tissue. Here, we demonstrate that oxysterols also critically regulate iBALT generation and the immune pathogenesis of COPD In both COPD patients and cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed mice, we identified significantly upregulated CH25H and CYP7B1 expression in airway epithelial cells, regulating CS-induced B-cell migration and iBALT formation. Mice deficient in CH25H or the oxysterol receptor EBI2 exhibited decreased iBALT and subsequent CS-induced emphysema. Further, inhibition of the oxysterol pathway using clotrimazole resolved iBALT formation and attenuated CS-induced emphysema in vivo therapeutically. Collectively, our studies are the first to mechanistically interrogate oxysterol-dependent iBALT formation in the pathogenesis of COPD, and identify a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of COPD and potentially other diseases driven by the generation of tertiary lymphoid organs.
We fed rats noodle (N) -diet containing 30 wt.% instant noodle with a 26% fat-to-energy ratio for 30 days (N-group). Compared with rats that were fed the same amount of nutrients (C-group), the N-group showed lower liver triacylglycerol levels and higher fecal cholesterol levels. We then analyzed transcriptome of the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP), the liver and the white adipose tissue (WAT). Thyroid stimulating hormone (Tshb), and its partner, glycoprotein hormone genes were up-regulated in the HP of N-group. Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors were activated in the liver of N-group, while an up-regulation of the angiogenic signal occurred in the WAT of N-group. N-group showed higher urine noradrenaline (NA) level suggesting that these tissue signals are regulated by NA and Tshb. The N-diet contains 0.326 wt.% glutamate, 0.00236 wt.% 6-shogaol and Maillard reaction products. Our results suggest that these ingredients may affect lipid homeostasis via the HP axis.
Atherosclerosis is a complex disease resulting from the interaction of multiple genes, including those causing dyslipidemia. Relatively few of the causative genes have been identified. Previously, we identified Apoa2 as a major determinant of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in the mouse model. To identify additional HDL-C level quantitative trait loci (QTLs), while controlling for the effect of the Apoa2 locus, we performed linkage analysis in 179 standard diet-fed F(2) mice derived from strains BALB/cJ and B6.C-H25(c) (a congenic strain carrying the BALB/c Apoa2 allele). Three significant QTLs and one suggestive locus were identified. A female-specific locus mapping to chromosome 6 (Chr 6) also exhibited effects on plasma non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein AII (apoAII), apoB, and apoE levels. A Chr 6 QTL was independently isolated in a related congenic strain (C57BL/6J vs. B6.NODc6: P = 0.003 and P = 0.0001 for HDL-C and non-HDL-C levels, respectively). These data are consistent with polygenic inheritance of HDL-C levels in the mouse model and provide candidate loci for HDL-C and non-HDL-C level determination in humans.
Lecithin cholesterol acyltyransferase (LCAT) deficiency is a rare monogenic disorder causing lipoprotein dysregulation and multiple organ dysfunctions, including renal impairment. LCAT knockout mice have been shown informative in elucidating mechanisms of many major clinical morbid phenotypes. Extended characterization of the LDL receptor/LCAT double knockout (Ldlr/Lcat-DKO or DKO) mice had led to the discovery of a number of novel protective metabolic phenotypes, including resistance to obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and insulin resistance. We seek to integrate the findings to explore novel pathogenic pathways.
The chow fed DKO mice were found more insulin sensitive than their Ldlr-KO controls. Joint analyses of the three strains (DKO, Ldlr-KO and wild-type) revealed differential metabolic responses to a high cholesterol diet (HCD) vs. high-fat diet (HFD). DKO mice are protected from HFD-induced obesity, hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, insulin resistance, ER cholesterol and NASH markers (steatosis and inflammasomes). Joint analysis revealed the HFD-induced NASH is dependent on de-novo hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. DKO mice are protected from HCD-induced hepatic ER stress, ER cholesterol, but not NASH, the latter likely due to cholesterol crystal accumulation. DKO mice were found to develop ectopic brown adipose tissue (BAT) in skeletal muscle. Ectopic BAT derived in part from myoblast in utero and from adult satellite cells. Primed expression of PRDM16 and UCP in quiescent satellite cell caused by LCAT deficiency synergizes with cell cholesterol depletion to induce satellite cell-to-BAT transdifferentiation.
Metabolic phenotyping of selective LCAT null mice led to the discovery of novel metabolically protective pathways.
