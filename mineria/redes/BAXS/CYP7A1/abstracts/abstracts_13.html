<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Therapeutic medications for the treatment of depression have serious limitations, particularly delayed onset and low rates of efficacy. However, the discovery that a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine, a glutamate NMDA receptor channel blocker, can produce a rapid (within hours) antidepressant response that is sustained (about 1 week), even in patients considered treatment-resistant, has invigorated the field. In addition to these remarkable actions, ketamine has proven effective for the treatment of suicidal ideation. Efforts are under way to develop ketamine-like drugs with fewer side effects as well as agents that act at other sites within the glutamate neurotransmitter system. This includes ketamine metabolites and stereoisomers, drugs that act as NMDA allosteric modulators or that block mGluR2/3 autoreceptors. In addition, targets that enhance glutamate neurotransmission or synaptic function (or both), which are essential for the rapid and sustained antidepressant actions of ketamine in rodent models, are being investigated; examples are the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine and activators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which is required for the actions of ketamine. The discovery of ketamine and its unique mechanisms heralds a new era with tremendous promise for the development of novel, rapid, and efficacious antidepressant medications.
Much is known about the how Gβγ subunits regulate effectors in response to G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. However, there is still a lot we don't know about how specific combinations of Gβ and Gγ are wired into different signalling pathways. Here, using an siRNA screen for different Gβ and Gγ subunits, we examined an endogenous M3 muscarinic receptor signalling pathway in HEK 293 cells. We observed that Gβ(4) subunits were critical for calcium signalling and a downstream surrogate measured as ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity. A number of Gγ subunits could partner with Gβ(4) but the best coupling was seen via Gβ(4)γ(1). Intriguingly, knocking down Gβ(1) actually increased signalling through the M3-mAChR most likely via an increase in Gβ(4) levels. We noted that Gβ(1) occupies the promoter of Gβ(4) and may participate in maturation of its mRNA. This highlights a new role for Gβγ signalling beyond their canonical roles in cellular signalling.
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) continues to be a most common complication of surgery and anesthesia. It has been suggested that the inherited factors may play a significant role in the background sensitivity to both PONV and also chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), including resistance to antiemetic prophylaxis and/or therapy. This notion could be best exemplified by occurrence of PONV in several generations of families and concordance of PONV in monozygotic twins. The most frequently addressed issue in the research on genomic background of PONV/CINV relates to the inherited resistance to the antiemetic treatment (pharmacogenomics), and in lesser degree to their genomic background. The most common group of antiemetics consists of 5HT3 receptor antagonists, and this group was an initial target of pharmacogenomic research. Most research approaches have been based on the investigation of polymorphic variations in the target for the antiemetic 5HT3 receptor antagonists, i.e., serotonin receptor subunits A and B (HTR3A and HTR3B). The other area of pharmacogenomic investigations includes metabolic pathways of 5HT3 antagonists, in particular polymorphic variants of the CYP450 2D6 isoform (CYP2D6) because most of them are metabolized in various degrees by the CYP2D6 system. The results of targeted genomic association studies indicate that other genes are also associated with PONV and CINV, including OPRM1, and ABCB1. In addition, genes such as DRD2 and CHRM3 genes have recently been associated with PONV. The new genome-wide association studies seem also to indicate that the background genomic sensitivity to PONV and CINV might be multifactorial and include several genomic pathways. 
M3 and M1 subtype muscarinic receptors are co-expressed in normal and neoplastic intestinal epithelial cells. In mice, ablating Chrm3, the gene encoding M3R, robustly attenuates intestinal tumor formation. Here we investigated the effects of Chrm1 gene ablation, alone and in combination with Chrm3 ablation.
We used wild-type, Chrm1-/-, Chrm3-/- and combined Chrm1-/-/Chrm3-/- knockout (dual knockout) mice. Animals were treated with azoxymethane, an intestine-selective carcinogen. After 20 weeks, colon tumors were counted and analyzed histologically and by immunohistochemical staining. Tumor gene expression was analyzed using microarray and results validated by RT-PCR. Key findings were extended by analyzing gene and protein expression in human colon cancers and adjacent normal colon tissue.
Azoxymethane-treated Chrm3-/- mice had fewer and smaller colon tumors than wild-type mice. Reductions in colon tumor number and size were not observed in Chrm1-/- or dual knockout mice. To gain genetic insight into these divergent phenotypes we used an unbiased microarray approach to compare gene expression in tumors from Chrm3-/- to those in wild-type mice. We detected altered expression of 430 genes, validated by quantitative RT-PCR for the top 14 up- and 14 down-regulated genes. Comparing expression of this 28-gene subset in tumors from wild-type, Chrm3-/-, Chrm1-/- and dual knockout mice revealed significantly reduced expression of Zfp277, encoding zinc finger protein 277, in tissue from M3R-deficient and dual knockout mice, and parallel changes in Zfp277 protein expression. Notably, mRNA and protein for ZNF277, the human analogue of Zfp277, were increased in human colon cancer compared to adjacent normal colon, along with parallel changes in expression of M3R.
Our results identify a novel candidate mouse gene, Zfp277, whose expression pattern is compatible with a role in mediating divergent effects of Chrm3 and Chrm1 gene ablation on murine intestinal neoplasia. The biological importance of this observation is strengthened by finding increased expression of ZNF277 in human colon cancer with a parallel increase in M3R expression. The role of zinc finger protein 277 in colon cancer and its relationship to M3R expression and activation are worthy of further investigation.
Asthma is a complex disease for which genetic predisposition has been widely documented. Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that polymorphisms in the muscarinic-cholinergic (CHRM) genes could be involved in asthma pathogenesis, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucus secretion. To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes in CHRM1, CHRM2, or CHRM3 are associated with asthma in Mexican pediatric population. We performed a case-control study including 398 pediatric cases with asthma and 450 healthy controls. We analyzed 19 SNPs distributed among these three genes. Two of the seven SNPs located in CHRM2, the 3' untranslated region rs8191992 and rs6962027, differed significantly in allele frequencies between patients with asthma and healthy controls [odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1.14-1.77, P = 0.001, and OR 1.50, 95 % CI 1.21-1.87, P = 0.0002, respectively]. Statistical significance remained after multiple comparison corrections (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005, respectively). The haplotypes AA and TT, containing both major and minor alleles from rs8191992 and rs6962027, also differed between cases and controls. The haplotype AA occurred at a lower frequency in cases (OR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.53-0.85, P = 0.001) whereas the haplotype TT was overrepresented in cases compared to controls (28 vs 21 %, respectively; OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.15-1.85, P = 0.002). No association was observed between CHRM1 or CHRM3 SNPs or haplotypes and asthma. CHRM2 polymorphisms are implicated in the genetic etiology of asthma.
The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether type 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R) dysfunction induced vascular hyperpermeability. Transwell system analysis showed that M3R inhibition by selective antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and small interfering RNA both increased endothelial permeability. Using coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot assay, we found that M3R inhibition increased VE-cadherin and β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation without affecting their expression. Using PTP1B siRNA, we found that PTP1B was required for maintaining VE-cadherin and β-catenin protein dephosphorylation. In addition, 4-DAMP suppressed PTP1B activity by reducing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), but not protein kinase Cα (PKCα). These data indicate that M3R preserves the endothelial barrier function through a mechanism potentially maintaining PTP1B activity, keeping the adherens junction proteins (AJPs) dephosphorylation.
Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the central nervous system are considered as congenital disorders. They are composed of abnormally developed dilated arteries and veins and are characterized microscopically by the absence of a capillary network. We previously reported DNA fragmentation and increased expression of apoptosis-related factors in AVM lesions. In this article, we used microarray analysis to examine differential gene expression in relation to clinical manifestations in 11 AVM samples from Japanese patients. We categorized the genes with altered expression into four groups: death-related, neuron-related, inflammation-related, and other. The death-related differentially expressed genes were MMP9, LIF, SOD2, BCL2A1, MMP12, and HSPA6. The neuron-related genes were NPY, S100A9, NeuroD2, S100Abeta, CAMK2A, SYNPR, CHRM2, and CAMKV. The inflammation-related genes were PTX3, IL8, IL6, CXCL10, GBP1, CHRM3, CXCL1, IL1R2, CCL18, and CCL13. In addition, we compared gene expression in those with or without clinical characteristics including deep drainer, embolization, and high-flow nidus. We identified a small number of genes. Using these microarray data we are able to generate and test new hypotheses to explore AVM pathophysiology. Microarray analysis is a useful technique to study clinical specimens from patients with brain vascular malformations. 
[(3)H]4-DAMP is a radioligand that has been used to quantify levels of the muscarinic receptor CHRM3 protein in situ. However, in addition to high affinity binding to CHRM3, [(3)H]4-DAMP binds with low affinity to CHRM1 confounding the potential to discriminate between changes in these two muscarinic receptors. We have developed a [(3)H]4-DAMP binding assay, optimised for measuring CHRM3 protein levels in the cortex, with minimal selectivity towards CHRM1. The selectivity of our assay towards CHRM3 was confirmed using recombinant receptor-expressing, cell lysate preparations. [(3)H]4-DAMP binding levels were similar between wildtype and CHRM1 knockout mice, confirming that the amount of [(3)H]4-DAMP binding to CHRM1 was negligible. We used this assay to measure CHRM3 protein levels in the frontal pole, obtained post-mortem from subjects with bipolar disorder (n = 15), major depressive disorder (n = 15) and matched controls (n = 20) and showed that [(3)H]4-DAMP binding was not altered in either bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. Western blotting confirmed that CHRM3 protein levels were unchanged in these subjects.
Hypomethylation of LINE-1 elements has emerged as a distinguishing feature in human cancers. Limited evidence indicates that some LINE-1 elements encode an additional internal antisense promoter, and increased hypomethylation of this region may lead to inadvertent activation of evolutionarily methylation-silenced downstream genes. However, the significance of this fundamental epigenetic mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been investigated previously.
We analysed tissue specimens from 77 CRC patients with matched sets of normal colonic mucosa, primary CRC tissues (PC), and liver metastasis tissues (LM). LINE-1 methylation levels were determined by quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. MET, RAB3IP and CHRM3 protein expression was determined by western blotting and IHC. MET proto-oncogene transcription and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmc) were evaluated by quantitative real-time-PCR.
Global LINE-1 methylation levels in LM were significantly lower compared with the matched PC (PC=66.2% vs LM=63.8%; p&lt;0.001). More importantly, we observed that specific LINE-1 sequences residing within the intronic regions of multiple proto-oncogenes, MET (p&lt;0.001), RAB3IP (p=0.05) and CHRM3 (p=0.01), were significantly hypomethylated in LM tissues compared with corresponding matched PC. Furthermore, reduced methylation of specific LINE-1 elements within the MET gene inversely correlated with induction of MET expression in CRC metastases (R=-0.44; p&lt;0.0001). Finally, increased 5-hmc content was associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation.
Our results provide novel evidence that hypomethylation of specific LINE-1 elements permits inadvertent activation of methylation-silenced MET, RAB3IP and CHRM3 proto-oncogenes in CRC metastasis. Moreover, since 5-hmc content inversely correlated with LINE-1 hypomethylation in neoplastic tissues, our results provide important mechanistic insights into the fundamental processes underlying global DNA hypomethylation in human CRC.
Previously, we showed that M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R; gene name Chrm3) deficiency attenuates murine intestinal neoplasia, supporting the hypothesis that muscarinic receptors play an important role in intestinal tumorigenesis.
To test this hypothesis, in the present study we treated mice with bethanechol, a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist without nicotinic receptor activity, and examined its effects on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon neoplasia. Mice were provided with drinking water containing 400 μg/mL bethanechol chloride or water without additions (control) for a total of 20 weeks, a period that included the initial 6 weeks when mice received intraperitoneal injections of AOM.
When euthanized at week 20, control mice had 8.0 ± 1.3 tumors per animal, whereas bethanechol-treated mice had 10.4 ± 1.5 tumors per mouse (mean ± SE; P = 0.023), a 30% increase. Strikingly, tumor volume per animal was increased 52% in bethanechol-treated compared with control mice (179.7 ± 21.0 vs. 111. 8 ± 22.4 mm(3); P = 0.047). On histological examination, bethenechol-treated mice also had more adenocarcinomas per animal (8.0 ± 1.0 vs. 4.1 ± 0.6 for control mice, P = 0.0042). Cell proliferation in both normal mucosa and adenocarcinomas was increased in bethanechol-treated compared to control mice. Also, in tumors, bethanechol treatment increased expression of Chrm3, Egfr and post-Egfr signaling molecules Myc and cyclin D1. Bethanechol treatment increased the thickness of normal colonic mucosa and the expression of selected matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp) genes, including Mmp7, Mmp10 and Mmp13.
These findings support a prominent role for muscarinic receptors in colon neoplasia, and identify post-receptor signaling molecules as potential therapeutic targets.
Lower urinary tract and/or kidney malformations are collectively the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in children, and they are also likely to account for a major subset of young adults requiring renal replacement therapy. Advances have been made regarding the discovery of the genetic causes of human kidney malformations. Indeed, testing for mutations of key nephrogenesis genes is now feasible for patients seen in nephrology clinics. Unfortunately, less is known about defined genetic bases of human lower urinary tract anomalies. The focus of this review is the genetic bases of congenital structural and functional disorders of the urinary bladder. Three are highlighted. First, prune belly syndrome, where mutations of CHRM3, encoding an acetylcholine receptor, HNF1B, encoding a transcription factor, and ACTA2, encoding a cytoskeletal protein, have been reported. Second, the urofacial syndrome, where mutations of LRIG2 and HPSE2, encoding proteins localised in nerves invading the fetal bladder, have been defined. Finally, we review emerging evidence that bladder exstrophy may have genetic bases, including variants in the TP63 promoter. These genetic discoveries provide a new perspective on a group of otherwise poorly understood diseases. 
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a mucocutaneous blistering disease characterized by IgG autoantibodies against the stratified squamous epithelium. Current understanding of PV pathophysiology does not explain the mechanism of acantholysis in patients lacking desmoglein antibodies, which justifies a search for novel targets of pemphigus autoimmunity. We tested 264 pemphigus and 138 normal control sera on the multiplexed protein array platform containing 701 human genes encompassing many known keratinocyte cell-surface molecules and members of protein families targeted by organ-non-specific PV antibodies. The top 10 antigens recognized by the majority of test patients' sera were proteins encoded by the DSC1, DSC3, ATP2C1, PKP3, CHRM3, COL21A1, ANXA8L1, CD88 and CHRNE genes. The most common combinations of target antigens included at least one of the adhesion molecules DSC1, DSC3 or PKP3 and/or the acetylcholine receptor CHRM3 or CHRNE with or without the MHC class II antigen DRA. To identify the PV antibodies most specific to the disease process, we sorted the data based on the ratio of patient to control frequencies of antigen recognition. The frequency of antigen recognition by patients that exceeded that of control by 10 and more times were the molecules encoded by the CD33, GP1BA, CHRND, SLC36A4, CD1B, CD32, CDH8, CDH9, PMP22 and HLA-E genes as well as mitochondrial proteins encoded by the NDUFS1, CYB5B, SOD2, PDHA1 and FH genes. The highest specificity to PV showed combinations of autoantibodies to the calcium pump encoded by ATP2C1 with C5a receptor plus DSC1 or DSC3 or HLA-DRA. The results identified new targets of pemphigus autoimmunity. Novel autoantibody signatures may help explain individual variations in disease severity and treatment response, and serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers for new diagnostic assays in PV patients.
In psoriasis, only limited overlap between sets of genes identified as differentially expressed (psoriatic lesional vs. psoriatic non-lesional) was found using statistical and fold-change cut-offs. To provide a framework for utilizing prior psoriasis data sets we sought to understand the consistency of those sets.
Microarray expression profiling and qRT-PCR were used to characterize gene expression in PP and PN skin from psoriasis patients. cDNA (three new data sets) and cRNA hybridization (four existing data sets) data were compared using a common analysis pipeline. Agreement between data sets was assessed using varying qualitative and quantitative cut-offs to generate a DEG list in a source data set and then using other data sets to validate the list. Concordance increased from 67% across all probe sets to over 99% across more than 10,000 probe sets when statistical filters were employed. The fold-change behavior of individual genes tended to be consistent across the multiple data sets. We found that genes with &lt;2-fold change values were quantitatively reproducible between pairs of data-sets. In a subset of transcripts with a role in inflammation changes detected by microarray were confirmed by qRT-PCR with high concordance. For transcripts with both PN and PP levels within the microarray dynamic range, microarray and qRT-PCR were quantitatively reproducible, including minimal fold-changes in IL13, TNFSF11, and TNFRSF11B and genes with &gt;10-fold changes in either direction such as CHRM3, IL12B and IFNG.
Gene expression changes in psoriatic lesions were consistent across different studies, despite differences in patient selection, sample handling, and microarray platforms but between-study comparisons showed stronger agreement within than between platforms. We could use cut-offs as low as log10(ratio) = 0.1 (fold-change = 1.26), generating larger gene lists that validate on independent data sets. The reproducibility of PP signatures across data sets suggests that different sample sets can be productively compared.
Deletions on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 1 result in complex and highly variable clinical phenotypes which include intellectual disability, autism, seizures, microcephaly/craniofacial dysmorphology, corpus callosal agenesis/hypogenesis, cardiac and genital anomalies, hand and foot abnormalities and short stature. Genotype-phenotype correlation reported a minimum region of 2 Mb at 1q43-q44. We report on a 3 ½ year old male patient diagnosed with autistic disorder who has social withdrawal, eating problems, repetitive stereotypic behaviors including self-injurious head banging and hair pulling, and no seizures, anxiety, or mood swings. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed an interstitial deletion of 473 kb at 1q43 region (239,412,391-239,885,394; NCBI build37/hg19) harboring only CHRM3 (Acetylcholine Receptor, Muscarinic, 3; OMIM: 118494). Recently, another case with a de novo interstitial deletion of 911 kb at 1q43 encompassing three genes including CHRM3 was reported. The M3 muscarinic receptor influences a multitude of central and peripheral nervous system processes via its interaction with acetylcholine and may be an important modulator of behavior, learning and memory. We propose CHRM3 as a candidate gene responsible for our patient's specific phenotype as well as the overlapping phenotypic features of other patients with 1q43 or 1q43-q44 deletions.
Genetic generalized epilepsies (GGEs) have a lifetime prevalence of 0.3% and account for 20-30% of all epilepsies. Despite their high heritability of 80%, the genetic factors predisposing to GGEs remain elusive. To identify susceptibility variants shared across common GGE syndromes, we carried out a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 3020 patients with GGEs and 3954 controls of European ancestry. To dissect out syndrome-related variants, we also explored two distinct GGE subgroups comprising 1434 patients with genetic absence epilepsies (GAEs) and 1134 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Joint Stage-1 and 2 analyses revealed genome-wide significant associations for GGEs at 2p16.1 (rs13026414, P(meta) = 2.5 × 10(-9), OR[T] = 0.81) and 17q21.32 (rs72823592, P(meta) = 9.3 × 10(-9), OR[A] = 0.77). The search for syndrome-related susceptibility alleles identified significant associations for GAEs at 2q22.3 (rs10496964, P(meta) = 9.1 × 10(-9), OR[T] = 0.68) and at 1q43 for JME (rs12059546, P(meta) = 4.1 × 10(-8), OR[G] = 1.42). Suggestive evidence for an association with GGEs was found in the region 2q24.3 (rs11890028, P(meta) = 4.0 × 10(-6)) nearby the SCN1A gene, which is currently the gene with the largest number of known epilepsy-related mutations. The associated regions harbor high-ranking candidate genes: CHRM3 at 1q43, VRK2 at 2p16.1, ZEB2 at 2q22.3, SCN1A at 2q24.3 and PNPO at 17q21.32. Further replication efforts are necessary to elucidate whether these positional candidate genes contribute to the heritability of the common GGE syndromes.
Numerous studies have proven that the nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist atropine prevents the axial elongation that leads to myopia. Five distinct receptor genes (CHRM1-CHRM5), each encoding a muscarinic receptor protein (M[1]-M[5]), have been cloned. Copy number variations (CNVs), which constitute a substantial portion of genetic variability and structural genetic variants, are increasingly being recognized as modulators of human diseases. In this study, CNVs of CHRMs were detected to determine the genes associated with myopia.
Participants were divided into three groups: high myopia group (myopia of 6-10 diopters [D]), severe high myopia group (myopia ≥ 10 D), and control group (myopia ≤ 0.5 D). The CNVs were detected, and the relative copy number was estimated using the comparative 2(-ΔΔCt)
Syrian hamsters with form-deprivation myopia (FDM) were used as animal models of myopia.
The CNVs of CHRM2, CHRM3, and CHRM4 were significantly different among the groups, and the variations were most dominant in the CHRM3. The CNVs of CHRM3 showed significant differences among all 3 groups (P = 0.005). A replication cohort was collected to further confirm the association of CHRM3 CNV with myopia (P = 0.011). The expression of M(3) on the sclera of the FDM Syrian hamsters was upregulated and then downregulated after atropine administration.
CHRM3 and M(3) were suggested to play important roles in the pathogenesis of myopia and in the arrested progression of myopia by atropine.
Exposure to nanosized particles may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by endothelial dysfunction, particularly in susceptible subjects with metabolic syndrome. We investigated vasomotor dysfunction in aorta from obese and lean Zucker rats after oral exposure to nanosized carbon black (CB). Rats were exposed to 1 or 10 weekly doses of 0, 0.064, 0.64 or 6.4 mg/kg bodyweight and sacrificed 24 h or 13 weeks later. The exposure to 10 doses of 0.064 or 0.64 mg/kg reduced the acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in the lean and obese rats. The half maximal effect concentration values increased by twofold (95% CI: 1.1-3.5-fold) and fourfold (95% CI: 2.3-6.9-fold) in the rats exposed to 0.064 and 0.64 mg/kg compared with the controls, respectively. The rats exposed to 10 doses of 0.64 mg/kg had also 20% (95% CI: 10-29%) lower maximal effect value compared with the controls. However, the nitroglycerin-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasocontraction was not affected in rats exposed to CB. The endothelial dysfunction was not observed in rats sacrificed 13 weeks after the last CB exposure. There was unaltered expression of Chrm3, Nos3, Nos2, Ccl2, and Hmox1 in aorta tissue of CB-exposed rats. In conclusion, repeated oral exposure to CB was associated with endothelial dysfunction in rats, further aggravating the effect of metabolic syndrome.
Beer, one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, has been shown to stimulate gastric acid secretion. Although organic acids, formed by fermentation of glucose, are known to be stimulants of gastric acid secretion, very little is known about the effects of different types of beer or the active constituents thereof. In the present study, we compared the effects of different beers on mechanisms of gastric acid secretion. To investigate compound-specific effects on mechanisms of gastric acid secretion, organic acids and bitter compounds were quantified by HPLC-DAD and UPLC-MS/MS and tested in human gastric cancer cells (HGT-1) by means of a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye which determines the intracellular pH as an indicator of proton secretion. The expression of relevant genes, coding the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase, ATP4A, the histamine receptor, HRH2, the acetylcholine receptor, CHRM3, and the somatostatin receptor, SSTR2, was determined by qPCR. Ethanol and the organic acids succinic acid, malic acid, and citric acid were demonstrated to contribute to some extent to the effect of beer. The bitter acids comprising α-, β-, and iso-α-acids were identified as potential key components promoting gastric acid secretion and up-regulation of CHRM3 gene expression by a maximum factor of 2.01 compared to that of untreated control cells with a correlation to their respective bitterness.
The transport of the oocyte and the embryo in the oviduct is managed by ciliary beating and muscular contractions. Because nonneuronally produced acetylcholine influences ciliary beating in the trachea via the muscarinic receptors M2 and M3, we supposed that components of the cholinergic system may also modulate ciliary activity in the oviduct. To address this issue, we analyzed the expression profile of muscarinic receptors (CHRMs) in the murine oviduct by RT-PCR and assessed ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and cilia-driven particle transport speed (PTS) on the mucosal surface of opened oviductal segments in correlation with histomorphological investigations. RT-PCR of laser-assisted microdissected epithelium revealed expression of Chrm subtypes Chrm1 and Chrm3. In opened isthmic segments, particle transport was barely seen, correlating with a significantly lower number of ciliated cells compared to the ampulla. In the ampulla, basal PTS and CBF were high (71 μm/sec and 21 Hz, respectively) both in cycling and pregnant wild-type mice and in mice with targeted deletion of the Chrm genes Chrm1, Chrm3, Chrm4, and Chrm5. In contrast to the trachea, where basal ciliary activity was low and largely enhanced by muscarinic stimulation, muscarinic agonists and antagonists did not affect the high ampullar PTS. Our results imply that this high oviductal autonomous ciliary activity is independent from the intrinsic cholinergic system and serves to maintain optimal clearance of the tube throughout all stages of the estrous cycle and early pregnancy.
Bronchodilators are drugs of choice in the combined therapy of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the therapeutic sensitivity is variable between patients, probably because of structural features of regulating molecules or variation in key genes' expression.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the β2-adrenoceptor (ADRB2) and M3-cholinoreceptor (CHRM3) gene expression in bronchial mucosa in patients with COPD and different severity of asthma.
Biopsy specimens of right middle lobar bronchus were obtained from 59 asthma patients (10 patients with severe brittle phenotype, 14 patients with severe asthma with persistent airflow limitation, 27 patients with moderate asthma, and 8 patients with mild asthma) and 10 COPD patients with or without bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for the ADRB2 and CHRM3 genes in bronchial mucosa were revealed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and compared between groups.
An increase of the ADRB2 genes expression was demonstrated in patients with severe asthma and COPD as compared with patients with mild and moderate disease. Significantly higher levels of ADRB2 mRNA were observed in patients with severe asthma with persistent airflow limitation. Significantly lower levels of the CHRM3 mRNA were observed in patients with COPD as compared with asthma patients. Also, CHRM3 gene expression was significantly elevated in COPD patients with BHR as compared with patients without BHR.
The results of the study suggest that the differential expression of the ADRB2 and CHRM3 genes is associated with asthma and COPD clinical subtypes.
Patients with distal deletions of chromosome 1q have a recognizable syndrome that includes microcephaly, hypoplasia or agenesis of the corpus callosum, and psychomotor retardation. Although these symptoms have been attributed to deletions of 1q42-1q44, the minimal chromosomal region involved has not yet defined. In this report, we describe a 7 years old male with mental retardation, cryptorchid testes, short stature and alopecia carrying only an interstitial de novo deletion of 911 Kb in the 1q43 region (239,597,095-240,508,817) encompassing three genes CHRM3, RPS7P5 and FMN2.
Chlorogenic acid (CA), caffeine (CAFF), pyrogallol (PYR), catechol (CAT), (β)N-alkanoyl-hydroxytryptamides (C5HT) and N-methylpyridinium (N-MP) were evaluated for their influence on mechanisms of gastric acid secretion as single compounds and in biomimetic mixtures.
Compounds were tested in coffee representative concentrations. Human gastric cancer cells (HGT-1) were used to study the proton secretory activity by Ussing chamber experiments and FACS analysis. For activation of EGFr, Akt1, ERK1/2, ATF-2 and cAMP levels, we performed pathway screening assays. Time-dependent expression of related genes were determined by real-time PCR. Part of the data was used for neural network modeling to identify the most relevant compounds. N-MP increased the expression of the anti-secretory somatostatin receptor by 114%, whereas C5HT decreased its expression by 52%. N-MP down-regulated the pro-secretory CHRM3 receptor by 36% and the H⁺,K⁺-ATPase by 36%. CAFF stimulated the secretory activity in the functional assays, whereas N-MP and CA decreased proton secretion. After applying a pathway analysis, we were able to discriminate between CAFF, CA, CAT, C5HT, PYR and histamine-activating EGFr signaling and N-MP-associated ERK1/2 signaling.
By applying a multi-parametric approach, N-MP was shown to effectively down-regulate mechanisms of gastric acid secretion in human parietal gastric cells.
Despite the substantial impact of sleep disturbances on human health and the many years of study dedicated to understanding sleep pathologies, the underlying genetic mechanisms that govern sleep and wake largely remain unknown. Recently, the authors completed large-scale genetic and gene expression analyses in a segregating inbred mouse cross and identified candidate causal genes that regulate the mammalian sleep-wake cycle, across multiple traits including total sleep time, amounts of rapid eye movement (REM), non-REM, sleep bout duration, and sleep fragmentation. Here the authors describe a novel approach toward validating candidate causal genes, while also identifying potential targets for sleep-related indications. Select small-molecule antagonists and agonists were used to interrogate candidate causal gene function in rodent sleep polysomnography assays to determine impact on overall sleep architecture and to evaluate alignment with associated sleep-wake traits. Significant effects on sleep architecture were observed in validation studies using compounds targeting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 subunit (Chrm3) (wake promotion), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit (Chrna4) (wake promotion), dopamine receptor D5 subunit (Drd5) (sleep induction), serotonin 1D receptor (Htr1d) (altered REM fragmentation), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) (light sleep promotion and reduction of deep sleep), and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T type, alpha 1I subunit (Cacna1i) (increased bout duration of slow wave sleep). Taken together, these results show the complexity of genetic components that regulate sleep-wake traits and highlight the importance of evaluating this complex behavior at a systems level. Pharmacological validation of genetically identified putative targets provides a rapid alternative to generating knock out or transgenic animal models, and may ultimately lead towards new therapeutic opportunities.
Urinary bladder malformations associated with bladder outlet obstruction are a frequent cause of progressive renal failure in children. We here describe a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) (1q41-q44) homozygous frameshift mutation in familial congenital bladder malformation associated with a prune-belly-like syndrome, defining an isolated gene defect underlying this sometimes devastating disease. CHRM3 encodes the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which we show is present in developing renal epithelia and bladder muscle. These observations may imply that M3 has a role beyond its known contribution to detrusor contractions. This Mendelian disease caused by a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mutation strikingly phenocopies Chrm3 null mutant mice.
Prolonged febrile seizures constitute an initial precipitating injury (IPI) commonly associated with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (RMTLE). In order to investigate IPI influence on the transcriptional phenotype underlying RMTLE we comparatively analyzed the transcriptomic signatures of CA3 explants surgically obtained from RMTLE patients with (FS) or without (NFS) febrile seizure history. Texture analyses on MRI images of dentate gyrus were conducted in a subset of surgically removed sclerotic hippocampi for identifying IPI-associated histo-radiological alterations.
DNA microarray analysis revealed that CA3 global gene expression differed significantly between FS and NFS subgroups. An integrative functional genomics methodology was used for characterizing the relations between GO biological processes themes and constructing transcriptional interaction networks defining the FS and NFS transcriptomic signatures and its major gene-gene links (hubs). Co-expression network analysis showed that: i) CA3 transcriptomic profiles differ according to the IPI; ii) FS distinctive hubs are mostly linked to glutamatergic signalization while NFS hubs predominantly involve GABAergic pathways and neurotransmission modulation. Both networks have relevant hubs related to nervous system development, what is consistent with cell genesis activity in the hippocampus of RMTLE patients. Moreover, two candidate genes for therapeutic targeting came out from this analysis: SSTR1, a relevant common hub in febrile and afebrile transcriptomes, and CHRM3, due to its putative role in epilepsy susceptibility development. MRI texture analysis allowed an overall accuracy of 90% for pixels correctly classified as belonging to FS or NFS groups. Histological examination revealed that granule cell loss was significantly higher in FS hippocampi.
CA3 transcriptional signatures and dentate gyrus morphology fairly correlate with IPI in RMTLE, indicating that FS-RMTLE represents a distinct phenotype. These findings may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying refractory epilepsy phenotypes and contribute to the discovery of novel specific drug targets for therapeutic interventions.
We examined the association of ß3-adrenoceptor (ß3-AR) and cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3) polymorphisms with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
DNA was obtained from 81 IBS patients (39 diarrhea type, IBS-D; 25 constipation type, IBS-C, 5 mixed type, IBS-M; and 12 unsubtyped, IBS-U) and 73 controls. For the analyses IBS-(M + U) was combined into one group (NonDNonC). ß3-AR and CHRM3 polymorphisms were determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.
The ß3-AR genotype frequencies of T/C in IBS patients were significantly higher compared to those in controls. The distribution of the CHRM3 genotypes, C/C, T/C and T/T, was not significantly different between IBS patients and controls. The distribution of the ß3-AR and CHRM3 genotypes was not significantly different between IBS-D, IBS-C and NonDNonC. The frequencies of the CHRM3 genotypes in IBS were significantly different between disease duration greater than and less than 3 years.
ß3-AR polymorphisms in IBS patients are different compared to controls, and CHRM3 polymorphisms are also likely associated with disease duration in IBS. ß3-AR and CHRM3 polymorphisms could be associated with IBS.
Insertions of spliceosomal introns are very rare events during evolution of vertebrates and the mechanisms governing creation of novel intron(s) remain obscure. Largely, gene structures of melanocortin (MC) receptors are characterized by intron-less architecture. However, recently a few exceptions have been reported in some fishes. This warrants a systematic survey of MC receptors for understanding intron insertion events during vertebrate evolution.
We have compiled an extended list of MC receptors from different vertebrate genomes with variations in fishes. Notably, the closely linked MC2Rs and MC5Rs from a group of ray-finned fishes have three and one intron insertion(s), respectively, with conserved positions and intron phase. In both genes, one novel insertion was in the highly conserved DRY motif at the end of helix TM3. Further, the proto-splice site MAG↑R is maintained at intron insertion sites in these two genes. However, the orthologs of these receptors from zebrafish and tetrapods are intron-less, suggesting these introns are simultaneously created in selected fishes. Surprisingly, these novel introns are traceable only in four fish genomes. We found that these fish genomes are severely compacted after the separation from zebrafish. Furthermore, we also report novel intron insertions in P2Y receptors and in CHRM3. Finally, we report ultrasmall introns in MC2R genes from selected fishes.
The current repository of MC receptors illustrates that fishes have no MC3R ortholog. MC2R, MC5R, P2Y receptors and CHRM3 have novel intron insertions only in ray-finned fishes that underwent genome compaction. These receptors share one intron at an identical position suggestive of being inserted contemporaneously. In addition to repetitive elements, genome compaction is now believed to be a new hallmark that promotes intron insertions, as it requires rapid DNA breakage and subsequent repair processes to gain back normal functionality.
M3 subtype muscarinic receptors (CHRM3) are over-expressed in colon cancer. In this study, we used Apc(min/+) mice to identify the role of Chrm3 expression in a genetic model of intestinal neoplasia, explored the role of Chrm3 in intestinal mucosal development and determined the translational potential of inhibiting muscarinic receptor activation. We generated Chrm3-deficient Apc(min/+) mice and compared intestinal morphology and tumor number in 12-week-old Apc(min/+)Chrm3(-/-) and Apc(min/+)Chrm3(+/+) control mice. Compared with Apc(min/+)Chrm3(+/+) mice, Apc(min/+)Chrm3(-/-) mice showed a 70 and 81% reduction in tumor number and volume, respectively (P &lt; 0.01). In adenomas, β-catenin nuclear staining was reduced in Apc(min/+)Chrm3(-/-) compared with Apc(min/+)Chrm3(+/+) mice (P &lt; 0.02). Whereas Apc gene mutation increased the number of crypt and Paneth cells and decreased villus goblet cells, these changes were absent in Apc(min/+)Chrm3(-/-) mice. To determine whether pharmacological inhibition of muscarinic receptor activation attenuates intestinal neoplasia, we treated 6-week-old Apc(min/+) mice with scopolamine butylbromide, a non-subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist. After 8 weeks of continuous treatment, scopolamine butylbromide-treated mice showed a 22% reduction in tumor number (P = 0.027) and a 36% reduction in tumor volume (P = 0.004) as compared with control mice. Compared with Chrm3 gene ablation, the muscarinic antagonist was less efficacious, most probably due to shorter duration of treatment and incomplete blockade of muscarinic receptors. Overall, these findings indicate that interplay of Chrm3 and β-catenin signaling is important for intestinal mucosal differentiation and neoplasia and provide a proof-of-concept that pharmacological inhibition of muscarinic receptor activation can attenuate intestinal neoplasia in vivo.
A family history has been established as a risk factor for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but the identities of susceptibility genes remain unknown. The goal of this study was to identify the genetic loci that may contribute to PONV susceptibility in an adult population.
The authors performed a genome-wide association study involving pooling of DNA obtained from 122 patients with severe PONV and 129 matched controls. Each pool was hybridized to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray, and probe intensity was used to predict allele frequency. Differences in allele frequency between SNP in the PONV and control groups were ranked after accounting for the pooling error. The highest ranking SNPs were selected for individual genotyping in the subjects from whom the DNA pool was comprised and in the new verification cohort consisting of 208 subjects (104 PONV patients and 104 controls).
The authors identified 41 SNP targets showing substantial difference in allelic frequency between pools. These markers were first genotyped in the individual DNA samples from which the pools were comprised. The authors observed evidence for an association between PONV and 19 different loci in the genome. In the separate verification cohort, the association with PONV was observed for four SNPs. This association remained significant after correcting for multiple testing (P &lt; 0.0023) for one SNP (rs2165870), which is located upstream of the promoter for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 subtype (CHRM3) gene.
The authors performed the genome-wide association study for PONV using pooled DNA samples. Through individual genotyping, they confirmed association of at least one SNP that is predictive of PONV susceptibility.
This study investigates whether demographical, disease-related and genetic factors contribute to inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among patients receiving opioids for cancer pain.
Cancer patients receiving opioids were included from 17 centres in 11 European countries. Intensities of nausea and vomiting were reported by 1579 patients on four-point categorical scales. In stratified regression models including demographical and disease-related factors as covariates, 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 candidate genes related to opioid- or nausea/vomiting signalling pathways (ABCB1, OPRM1, OPRK1, ARRB2, STAT6, COMT, CHRM3, CHRM5, HRH1, DRD2, DRD3, TACR1, HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR3C, CNR1) were analysed for association with nausea and vomiting.
Age, body mass index, Karnofsky Performance Status, gender, use of antiemetics, type of opioid, type of cancer and eight SNPs were associated with the inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients treated with opioids (p&lt;0.01). The SNPs were rs1176744, rs3782025 and rs1672717 in HTR3B; rs165722, rs4680 and rs4633 in COMT; rs10802789 and rs685550 in CHRM3. Only the SNP rs1672717 in HTR3B passed the Benjamini-Hochberg criterion for a 10% false discovery rate.
Clinical characteristics and SNPs within the HTR3B, COMT and CHRM3 genes may be associated with the variability in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients receiving opioids. This knowledge may help to identify patients at particular risk for nausea and vomiting during treatment with opioids for cancer pain.
Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is characterised by a chronic inflammation of exocrine glands. Salivary gland infiltrates, however, do not correlate well with disease symptoms, and a primary role for the salivary gland parenchyma in disease development has been suggested. Specifically, dysfunction of exocrine pathways involving the muscarinic receptor 3 (CHRM3) has been indicated.
To investigate possible genetic divergence in the CHRM3 gene in patients with pSS.
530 patients with pSS and 532 controls from a combined Swedish and Norwegian cohort were genotyped for 84 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout CHRM3.
Genetic association was observed with five SNPs localised in intron 3 and 4 of CHRM3, the strongest being rs7548522 (minor allele frequency = 0.06, OR=1.93, 95% CI (1.24 to 3.01); p=0.0033). In addition, clinical parameters, including focus score, abnormal Schirmer's test and presence of autoantibodies, were associated with different SNPs in CHRM3.
The study demonstrates a novel association of CHRM3 polymorphisms with pSS, suggesting a functional role for CHRM3 and the salivary gland parenchyma in the pathogenesis of pSS.
Gene-gene interactions are proposed as an important component of the genetic architecture of complex diseases, and are just beginning to be evaluated in the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In addition to detecting epistasis, a benefit to interaction analysis is that it also increases power to detect weak main effects. We conducted a knowledge-driven interaction analysis of a GWAS of 931 multiple sclerosis (MS) trios to discover gene-gene interactions within established biological contexts. We identify heterogeneous signals, including a gene-gene interaction between CHRM3 (muscarinic cholinergic receptor 3) and MYLK (myosin light-chain kinase) (joint P=0.0002), an interaction between two phospholipase C-β isoforms, PLCβ1 and PLCβ4 (joint P=0.0098), and a modest interaction between ACTN1 (actinin alpha 1) and MYH9 (myosin heavy chain 9) (joint P=0.0326), all localized to calcium-signaled cytoskeletal regulation. Furthermore, we discover a main effect (joint P=5.2E-5) previously unidentified by single-locus analysis within another related gene, SCIN (scinderin), a calcium-binding cytoskeleton regulatory protein. This work illustrates that knowledge-driven interaction analysis of GWAS data is a feasible approach to identify new genetic effects. The results of this study are among the first gene-gene interactions and non-immune susceptibility loci for MS. Further, the implicated genes cluster within inter-related biological mechanisms that suggest a neurodegenerative component to MS.
Antipsychotic affinity for the histamine H1 receptor and the muscarinic M3 receptor have been associated with the side effects weight gain, and development of diabetes, respectively.
We investigated polymorphisms of the histamine H1 (HRH1) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) receptor genes for an association with body mass index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
We included 430 Caucasian patients with a non-affective psychotic disorder using antipsychotics for at least 3 months. Primary endpoints of the study were cross-sectionally measured BMI and HbA1c; secondary endpoints were obesity and hyperglycaemia. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HRH1 gene, rs346074 and rs346070, and one SNP in the CHRM3 gene, rs3738435, were genotyped. Our primary hypothesis in this study was an interaction between genotype on BMI and antipsychotic affinity for the H1 and M3 receptor.
A significant association of interaction between haplotype rs346074-rs346070 and BMI (p value 0.025) and obesity (p value 0.005) in patients using high-H1 affinity antipsychotics versus patients using low-H1 affinity antipsychotics was found. There was no association of CHRM3 gene variant rs3738435 with BMI, and we observed no association with HbA1c or hyperglycaemia in any of the variants.
This study, for the first time, demonstrates a significant association between HRH1 variants and BMI in patients with a psychotic disorder using antipsychotics. In future, genotyping of HRH1 variants may help predicting weight gain in patients using antipsychotics.
Muscarinic receptors (CHRM) are overexpressed in colon cancer. To explore a role for muscarinic receptor signaling in colon cancer metastasis, we used human H508 and HT29 colon cancer cells that coexpress epidermal growth factor (ERBB) and CHRM3 receptors. In a wound closure model, following 8-h incubation of H508 cells with 100 μM ACh we observed a threefold increase in cell migration indistinguishable from the actions of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Atropine blocked the actions of ACh but not of EGF. In SNU-C4 colon cancer cells that express ERBB but not CHRM, EGF caused a threefold increase in migration; ACh had no effect. ACh-induced cell migration was attenuated by chemical inhibitors of ERBB1 activation, by anti-ERBB1 antibody, and by inhibitors of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Consistent with matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7)-mediated release of an ERBB1 ligand, heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF), ACh-induced migration was inhibited by an MMP inhibitor and by anti-MMP7 and -HBEGF antibodies. ACh-induced cell migration was blocked by inhibiting RhoA and ROCK, key proteins that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. ACh-induced RhoA activation was attenuated by agents that inhibit ERBB1, ERK, and PI3K activation. Collectively, these findings indicate that ACh-induced cell migration is mediated by MMP7-mediated release of HBEGF, an ERBB ligand that activates ERBB1 and downstream ERK and PI3K signaling. In a cell invasion model, ACh-induced HT29 cell invasion was blocked by atropine. In concert with previous observations, these findings indicate that muscarinic receptor signaling plays a key role in colon cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion.
There are several clinical variants of severe difficult-to-treat asthma: asthma with persistent airflow limitation, brittle asthma, and fatal asthma; but the differences between the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease heterogeneity are unknown.
The aim was to evaluate the morphological and molecular characteristics of brittle asthma type I and asthma with persistent airflow limitation compared to mild-to-moderate asthma, by the analysis of the cellular structure and gene expression in the bronchial mucosa.
Bronchoscopic evaluation was performed in 42 asthmatic patients: 10 with brittle asthma, 10 with severe asthma with persistent airflow limitation, and 22 with mild-to-moderate asthma. Morphometric and cytological analyses of the bronchial mucosa were performed. The mRNA levels for the ADRB2, HRH1, and CHRM3 genes in the bronchial mucosa were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
A predominance of eosinophils (29.48/mm(2), 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.24-33.72) and neutrophils (40.13/mm(2), 95% CI 32.77-47.49) was observed in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma; however, histiocytes-macrophages (65.80/mm(2), 95% CI 56.95-74.65) and lymphocytes (52.94/mm(2), 95% CI 42.83-63.06) were more common in patients with brittle asthma, and neutrophil counts (81.11/mm(2), 95% CI 58.33-103.89) were significantly increased in subjects with persistent airflow limitation. An increase in the expression of the M(3)-cholinoreceptor and the beta(2)-adrenoreceptor genes was demonstrated in severe asthmatics compared to mild-to-moderate asthma patients. Significantly higher levels of CHRM3 (57.17%, 95% CI 55.04-59.29) and HRH1 (38.82%, 95% CI 35.84-41.81) mRNAs were observed in patients with brittle asthma. The level of ADRB2 gene expression (71.41%, 95% CI 63.54-85.09) was maximal in patients with asthma with persistent airflow limitation.
There is evidence of significantly different morphological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of inflammation and bronchoconstriction underlying the clinical heterogeneity of severe asthma.
In some individuals, the consumption of coffee beverages is related to symptoms of gastric irritation. Hot water steam-treatment of raw coffee beans is hypothesized to reduce the contents of stomach irritating compounds, and products to which this technology is applied are launched as stomach-friendly coffee. However, data on the effect of steam-treated coffee on gastric acid secretion are conflicting and it has not been proven yet as to which coffee components act as pro- or antisecretory stimulants. The work presented here aimed at the characterization of a coffee beverage that effectively down-regulates mechanisms of proton secretion in human gastric cells (HGT-1). At first, a regular coffee beverage was fractionated by using solvents of different polarity: water, ethylacetate, dichloromethane, and pentane. Functional assays on the proton secretory activity (PSA) of these solvent fractions revealed the least pronounced effect for the water fraction, for which quantitative analyses demonstrated the highest distribution of chlorogenic acid (95%), (beta)N-alkanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamides (55%), and N-methylpyridinium (N-MP, &gt;99%) among all fractions. Following experiments demonstrated that HGT-1 cells treated with regular coffee fortified with N-MP at a concentration of about 20 mg/mL N-MP showed a significantly decreased PSA as compared to cells which were exposed to coffee beverages containing higher (32-34 mg/L) or lower (5 mg/L) N-MP concentrations. Results from cellular pathway analyses of transcription (ATF-1 and Akt1) and signaling (cAMP and EGFr) factors and kinases (ERK1/2), and experiments on the gene expression of pro (histamine-HRH2 and acetylcholine-CHRM3)- and anti (somatostatin-SSTR1)-secretory receptors and H(+),K(+)-ATPase verified this antisecretory activity of N-MP in coffee beverages.
Previous work suggests that vagus nerve disruption reduces hepatocyte and oval cell expansion after liver injury. The role of postneuronal receptor activation in response to liver injury has not been ascertained. We investigated the actions of scopolamine, a nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist, and specific genetic ablation of a key cholinergic receptor, muscarinic subtype-3 (Chrm3), on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced liver injury in mice. Animal weights and survival were measured as was liver injury using both gross and microscopic examination. To assess hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis, ductular hyperplasia, and oval cell expansion, we used morphometric analysis of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-, activated caspase-3-, hematoxylin and eosin-, cytokeratin-19-, and epithelial cell adhesion molecule-stained liver sections. Sirius red staining was used as a measure of collagen deposition and its association with oval cell reaction. In AOM-treated mice, both muscarinic receptor blockade with scopolamine and Chrm3 ablation attenuated hepatocyte proliferation and augmented gross liver nodularity, apoptosis, and fibrosis. Compared with control, scopolamine-treated and Chrm3(-/-) AOM-treated mice had augmented oval cell reaction with increased ductular hyperplasia and oval cell expansion. Oval cell reaction correlated robustly with liver fibrosis. No liver injury was observed in scopolamine-treated and Chrm3(-/-) mice that were not treated with AOM. Only AOM-treated Chrm3(-/-) mice developed ascites and had reduced survival compared with AOM-treated wild-type controls. In AOM-induced liver injury, inhibiting postneuronal cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation with either scopolamine treatment or Chrm3 gene ablation results in prominent oval cell reaction. We conclude that Chrm3 plays a critical role in the liver injury response by modulating hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis.
The CHRM3 gene is a member of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family that plays important roles in the regulation of fundamental physiological functions. The evolutionary mechanism of exon-acquisition and alternative splicing of the CHRM3 gene in relation to transposable elements (TEs) were analyzed using experimental approaches and in silico analysis. Five different transcript variants (T1, T2, T3, T3-1, and T4) derived from three distinct promoter regions (T1: L1HS, T2, T4: original, T3, T3-1: THE1C) were identified. A placenta (T1) and testis (T3 and T3-1)-dominated expression pattern appeared to be controlled by different TEs (L1HS and THE1C) that were integrated into the common ancestor genome during primate evolution. Remarkably, the T1 transcript was formed by the integration event of the human specific L1HS element. Among the 12 different brain regions, the brain stem, olfactory region, and cerebellum showed decreased expression patterns. Evolutionary analysis of splicing sites and alternative splicing suggested that the exon-acquisition event was determined by a selection and conservation mechanism. Furthermore, continuous integration events of transposable elements could produce lineage specific alternative transcripts by providing novel promoters and splicing sites. Taken together, exon-acquisition and alternative splicing events of CHRM3 genes were shown to have occurred through the continuous integration of transposable elements following conservation.
Muscarinic receptors are known to regulate several important physiologic processes in the eye. Antagonists to these receptors such as atropine and pirenzepine are effective at stopping the excessive ocular growth that results in myopia. However, their site of action is unknown. This study details ocular muscarinic subtype expression within a well documented model of eye growth and investigates their expression during early stages of myopia induction.
Total RNA was isolated from tree shrew corneal, iris/ciliary body, retinal, choroidal, and scleral tissue samples and was reverse transcribed. Using tree shrew-specific primers to the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (CHRM1-CHRM5), products were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and their identity confirmed using automated sequencing. The expression of the receptor proteins (M1-M5) were also explored in the retina, choroid, and sclera using immunohistochemistry. Myopia was induced in the tree shrew for one or five days using monocular deprivation of pattern vision, and the expression of the receptor subtypes was assessed in the retina, choroid, and sclera using real-time PCR.
All five muscarinic receptor subtypes were expressed in the iris/ciliary body, retina, choroid, and sclera while gene products corresponding to CHRM1, CHRM3, CHRM4, and CHRM5 were present in the corneal samples. The gene expression data were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with the M1-M5 proteins detected in the retina, choroid, and sclera. After one or five days of myopia development, muscarinic receptor gene expression remained unaltered in the retinal, choroidal, and scleral tissue samples.
This study provides a comprehensive profile of muscarinic receptor gene and protein expression in tree shrew ocular tissues with all receptor subtypes found in tissues implicated in the control of eye growth. Despite the efficacy of muscarinic antagonists at inhibiting myopia development, the genes of the muscarinic receptor subtypes are neither regulated early in myopia (before measurable axial elongation) nor after significant structural change.
Dysfunction of the cholinergic muscarinic receptors has been implicated in the pathology of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between individual muscarinic receptors and the two disorders.
We used the muscarinic receptor selective radioligands [3H]pirenzepine, [3H]AFDX-384 and [3H]4-DAMP to measure the levels of muscarinic(1) (CHRM1) and muscarinic(4) (CHRM4) receptors, muscarinic(2) (CHRM2) and muscarinic(4) (CHRM4) receptors and muscarinic(3) (CHRM3) receptor, respectively. Radioligand binding was measured in Brodmann's area (BA) 10 of the rostral prefrontal cortex, BA 46 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and BA 40 of the parietal cortex in the post-mortem CNS from subjects with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder and control subjects.
[3H]AFDX-384 binding was decreased in BA 46 in both bipolar disorder (p&lt;0.01) and major depressive disorder (p&lt;0.05). [3H]4-DAMP binding was decreased in BA 10 in bipolar disorder (p&lt;0.05) but not major depressive disorder (p&gt;0.05). [3H]AFDX-384 and [3H]4-DAMP binding were unaltered in any other cortical region examined for either disorder (p&gt;0.05). [3H]pirenzepine binding was not significantly altered in either disorder in any cortical region examined (p&gt;0.05).
9 bipolar disorder, 9 major depressive disorder and 19 control subjects were used in the study.
Our data is consistent with previously published data implicating a role for CHRM2 receptors in the pathology of bipolar and major depressive disorder. The demonstration of a novel association between decreased CHRM3 receptor expression and bipolar disorder suggests bipolar and major depressive disorder differs in the underlying nature of their cholinergic dysfunction.
Dysregulated human eccrine sweat glands can negatively impact the quality-of-life of people suffering from disorders like hyperhidrosis. Inability of sweating can even result in serious health effects in humans affected by anhidrosis. The underlying mechanisms must be elucidated and a reliable in vitro test system for drug screening must be developed. Here we describe a novel organotypic three-dimensional (3D) sweat gland model made of primary human eccrine sweat gland cells. Initial experiments revealed that eccrine sweat gland cells in a two-dimensional (2D) culture lose typical physiological markers. To resemble the in vivo situation as close as possible, we applied the hanging drop cultivation technology regaining most of the markers when cultured in its natural spherical environment. To compare the organotypic 3D sweat gland model versus human sweat glands in vivo, we compared markers relevant for the eccrine sweat gland using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Comparing the marker profile, a high in vitro-in vivo correlation was shown. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3), Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin-1 (ANO1/TMEM16A), and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) are found at significant expression levels in the 3D model. Moreover, cholinergic stimulation with acetylcholine or pilocarpine leads to calcium influx monitored in a calcium flux assay. Cholinergic stimulation cannot be achieved with the sweat gland cell line NCL-SG3 used as a sweat gland model system. Our results show clear benefits of the organotypic 3D sweat gland model versus 2D cultures in terms of the expression of essential eccrine sweat gland key regulators and in the physiological response to stimulation. Taken together, this novel organotypic 3D sweat gland model shows a good in vitro-in vivo correlation and is an appropriate alternative for screening of potential bioactives regulating the sweat mechanism.
Asthma often progresses into adulthood from early-life episodes of adverse environmental exposures. However, how the injury to developing lungs contributes to the pathophysiology of persistent asthma remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified an age-related mechanism along the cholinergic nerve-airway smooth muscle (ASM) axis that underlies prolonged airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in mice. We showed that ASM continued to mature until ∼3 wk after birth. Coinciding with postnatal ASM maturation, there was a critical time window for the development of ASM hypercontractility after cholinergic stimulation. We found that allergen exposure in neonatal mice, but not in adult mice, elevated the level and activity of cholinergic nerves (termed neuroplasticity). We demonstrated that cholinergic neuroplasticity is necessary for the induction of persistent AHR after neonatal exposure during rescue assays in mice deficient in neuroplasticity. In addition, early intervention with cholinergic receptor muscarinic (ChRM)-3 blocker reversed the progression of AHR in the neonatal exposure model, whereas β2-adrenoceptor agonists had no such effect. Together, our findings demonstrate a functional relationship between cholinergic neuroplasticity and ASM contractile phenotypes that operates uniquely in early life to induce persistent AHR after allergen exposure. Targeting ChRM3 may have disease-modifying benefits in childhood asthma.-Patel, K. R., Bai, Y., Trieu, K. G., Barrios, J., Ai, X. Targeting acetylcholine receptor M3 prevents the progression of airway hyperreactivity in a mouse model of childhood asthma.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate, in vitro and in vivo, the contribution of muscarinic receptors to the effects of Ruscus extract. Ruscus extract was tested in competition binding experiments at recombinant human muscarinic receptors, heterologous expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and in cellular assays measuring Ca2+ liberation and activator protein-1 (AP-1) reporter gene activation. The impact of muscarinic blockade on prolonged treatment outcome was evaluated using the hamster cheek pouch (HCP) microcirculation examining macromolecular permeability increase induced by histamine or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), mean arteriolar and venular diameters, functional capillary density and I/R-induced leukocyte rolling and sticking. Ruscus extract exhibited affinities for muscarinic receptor subtypes at a range of 50-100μg/ml and behaved as partial agonist at human recombinant M1 and M3 receptors for Ca2+ liberation, confirmed in an AP-1 reporter gene assay. In the HCP model, topical application of atropine completely or partially blocked Ruscus extract-induced reductions of histamine- and I/R-induced increases of macromolecular permeability and leukocyte-endothelium interaction. Our results showed that Ruscus extract in vitro binds and activates different subtypes of muscarinic receptors and in vivo its anti-inflammatory effects are, at least partially, mediated via muscarinic receptors.
To evaluate the gene expression of collagen, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibitors, cholinergic muscarinic receptors (CHRMs), and angiogenic and nerve growth factors (NGFs) in the bladder of patients with bladder outlet obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
We analyzed bladder specimens from 43 patients with obstructive BPH undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate as compared to 10 age-matched controls with an International Prostatic Symptom Score of &lt;8 and a prostate volume of &lt;30 g. A bladder biopsy was performed for relative gene expression analysis with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of collagens I and III, MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9; tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK); CHRM2 and CHRM3; VEGF and CD105; and NGF and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFr).
Patients with bladder outlet obstruction presented a statistically significant overexpression of collagens I and III, VEGF, CHRM2, and CHRM3. CD105, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 were underexpressed. Expressions of NGF, NGFr, MMP-1, MMP-2, TIMP-2, and RECK were heterogeneous. CHRM2 and CHRM3 were overexpressed in patients with persistent detrusor overactivity. Smokers presented an upregulation of NGFr and VEGF; dyslipidemic patients had an overexpression of NGFr.
Bladder upregulation of collagens I and III on transcriptional level appears to be relevant in BPH. Muscarinic receptors CHRM2 and CHRM3 are also overexpressed, more so in patients with persistent detrusor overactivity. Upregulation of VEGF and NGFr, particularly in subjects with risk factors for atherosclerosis, reinforces the role of ischemia in BPH-induced modifications of the bladder.
M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R) activation promotes colon cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Although over-expression of CHRM3, the gene encoding M3R, is reported in primary colon cancers, expression of M3R itself has not been studied in colon neoplasia. We compared M3R expression in normal colon to colon adenomas, and primary and metastatic colon cancers. Compared to adjacent normal colon, CHRM3 expression was increased up to 128-fold in 10 of 18 consecutive surgical cancer specimens (56%) and associated with metastatic spread (P &lt; 0.05). To analyze M3R protein expression we interrogated 29 consecutive paraffin-embedded colon adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal colon using a specific anti-M3R antibody and immunoperoxidase staining. This revealed weak M3R expression in normal colonocytes, primarily on basolateral surfaces. In contrast, in 25 of 29 cancer tissues (86%) we observed both cytoplasmic and plasma membrane over-expression of M3R; compared to normal epithelium, mean M3R staining intensity was increased more than two-fold in colon cancer (P &lt; 0.001). M3R staining was also increased in 22 colon adenomas compared to adjacent normal colon (P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, M3R staining intensity was not increased in lymph node or liver metastases. These findings suggest M3R expression plays an important role in early progression and invasion of colon neoplasia but is less important once tumors have spread.
Morphine inefficiency to induce the internalization of mu opioid (MOP) receptors observed in numerous experimental models constitutes a paradigm of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) functional selectivity. We recently described that activation of Gαq/11 proteins through 5-HT2A serotonin receptors co-expressed in the same cells facilitates MOP receptor endocytosis promoted by morphine. In order to explore whether a different Gαq/11 coupled GPCR would emulate this effect, a double stable Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cell line permanently expressing MOP-YFP receptors along with FLAG-M3-Cerulean receptors expressed in an inducible manner was generated. Fluorescence microscopy examination of these cells revealed a co-distribution of both receptors mainly compartmentalized in plasma membrane. Concurrent stimulation with carbachol and morphine promoted MOP receptor internalization, desensitization and down-regulation and this facilitation was not dependent on PKC activation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that FLAG-M3-Cerulean/MOP-YFP receptors interact forming heteromeric complexes in a time depending manner, i.e. the strongest interaction was detected after 96h of FLAG-M3-Cerulean induced expression. Under these experimental conditions, treatment of cells with carbachol plus morphine resulted in the internalization of both receptors within separated endocytic vesicles as visualized by confocal microscopy. This trafficking segregation observed for FLAG-M3-Cerulean and MOP-YFP receptors upon agonist stimulation suggests that this protein-protein interaction presents temporal and dynamic properties. Moreover, MOP-YFP receptor internalization facilitated by FLAG-M3-Cerulean receptors is independent of the constitution of heteromeric complexes.
The central nervous system is functionally organized as a dynamic network of interacting neural circuits that underlies observable behaviors. At higher resolution, these behaviors, or phenotypes, are defined by the activity of a specific set of biomolecules within those circuits. Identification of molecules that govern psychiatric phenotypes is a major challenge. The only organic molecular entities objectively associated with psychiatric phenotypes in humans are drugs that induce psychiatric phenotypes and drugs used for treatment of specific psychiatric conditions. Here, we identified candidate biomolecules contributing to the organic basis for psychosis by deriving an in vivo biomolecule-tissue signature for the atypical pharmacologic action of the antipsychotic drug clozapine. Our novel in silico approach identifies the ensemble of potential drug targets based on the drug's chemical structure and the region-specific gene expression profile of each target in the central nervous system. We subtracted the signature of the action of clozapine from that of a typical antipsychotic, chlorpromazine. Our results implicate dopamine D4 receptors in the pineal gland and muscarinic acetylcholine M1 (CHRM1) and M3 (CHRM3) receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as significant and unique to clozapine, whereas serotonin receptors 5-HT2A in the PFC and 5-HT2C in the caudate nucleus were common significant sites of action for both drugs. Our results suggest that D4 and CHRM1 receptor activity in specific tissues may represent underappreciated drug targets to advance the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia. These findings may enhance our understanding of the organic basis of psychiatric disorders and help developing effective therapies.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by reduced lung function and is the third leading cause of death globally. Through genome-wide association discovery in 48,943 individuals, selected from extremes of the lung function distribution in UK Biobank, and follow-up in 95,375 individuals, we increased the yield of independent signals for lung function from 54 to 97. A genetic risk score was associated with COPD susceptibility (odds ratio per 1 s.d. of the risk score (∼6 alleles) (95% confidence interval) = 1.24 (1.20-1.27), P = 5.05 × 10-49), and we observed a 3.7-fold difference in COPD risk between individuals in the highest and lowest genetic risk score deciles in UK Biobank. The 97 signals show enrichment in genes for development, elastic fibers and epigenetic regulation pathways. We highlight targets for drugs and compounds in development for COPD and asthma (genes in the inositol phosphate metabolism pathway and CHRM3) and describe targets for potential drug repositioning from other clinical indications.
Bladder cancer is one of the major cancer types and both environmental factors and genetic background play important roles in its pathology. Kaohsiung is a high industrialized city in Taiwan, and here we focused on this region to evaluate the genetic effects on bladder cancer. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) was reported as a key receptor in different cancer types. CHRM3 is located at 1q42-43 which was reported to associate with bladder cancer. Our study attempted to delineate whether genetic variants of CHRM3 contribute to bladder cancer in Chinese Han population in south Taiwan. Five selected SNPs (rs2165870, rs10802789, rs685550, rs7520974, and rs3738435) were genotyped for 30 bladder cancer patients and 60 control individuals and genetic association studies were performed. Five haplotypes (GTTAT, ATTGT, GCTAC, ACTAC, and ACCAC) were found significantly associated with low CHRM3 mRNA level and contributed to increased susceptibility of bladder cancer in Kaohsiung city after rigid 10000 consecutive permutation tests. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic association study that reveals the genetic contribution of CHRM3 gene in bladder cancer etiology.
Patients with schizophrenia have abnormal autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity compared with the general population. One reason for this difference is the muscarinic affinity for antipsychotic drugs; therefore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the muscarinic receptor gene influence this ANS dysfunction. This study sought to determine the effect of SNPs of the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (CHRM) gene on ANS activity in patients with schizophrenia receiving antipsychotic drugs.
A total of 173 Japanese patients with schizophrenia were included in this study. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured as an index of ANS activity. SNPs in CHRM1 (rs542269 and rs2075748), CHRM2 (rs324640, rs8191992, rs1824024, and rs7810473), and CHRM3 (rs3738435, rs4620530, and rs6429157) were genotyped using the TaqMan® method. Patients were grouped according to standard equivalent conversions of chlorpromazine (CP) into a high-CP group (HG; ≥1,000 mg) and a low-CP group (LG; &lt;1,000 mg). ANS activity was compared between the groups. In addition, we compared the total, low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), and LF/HF components of the patients' HRV, and the genotype of the SNPs in both the HG and LG groups. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons, and the Bonferroni-corrected critical p value was &lt;0.005.
The A allele of the CHRM2 rs8191992 polymorphism in HG was associated with decreased ANS activity.
Our results show reduced ANS activity in association with the CHRM2 rs8191992 polymorphism in patients with schizophrenia on high-dose antipsychotics. CHRM2 polymorphisms may play an important role in ANS activity in patients with schizophrenia.
Environmental assessment of complex mixtures typically requires integration of chemical and biological measurements. This study demonstrates the use of a combination of instrumental chemical analyses, effects-based monitoring, and bio-effects prediction approaches to help identify potential hazards and priority contaminants in two Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), the Lower Green Bay/Fox River located near Green Bay, WI, USA and the Milwaukee Estuary, located near Milwaukee, WI, USA. Fathead minnows were caged at four sites within each AOC (eight sites total). Following 4d of in situ exposure, tissues and biofluids were sampled and used for targeted biological effects analyses. Additionally, 4d composite water samples were collected concurrently at each caged fish site and analyzed for 132 analytes as well as evaluated for total estrogenic and androgenic activity using cell-based bioassays. Of the analytes examined, 75 were detected in composite samples from at least one site. Based on multiple analyses, one site in the East River and another site near a paper mill discharge in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River AOC, were prioritized due to their estrogenic and androgenic activity, respectively. The water samples from other sites generally did not exhibit significant estrogenic or androgenic activity, nor was there evidence for endocrine disruption in the fish exposed at these sites as indicated by the lack of alterations in ex vivo steroid production, circulating steroid concentrations, or vitellogenin mRNA expression in males. Induction of hepatic cyp1a mRNA expression was detected at several sites, suggesting the presence of chemicals that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. To expand the scope beyond targeted investigation of endpoints selected a priori, several bio-effects prediction approaches were employed to identify other potentially disturbed biological pathways and related chemical constituents that may warrant future monitoring at these sites. For example, several chemicals such as diethylphthalate and naphthalene, and genes and related pathways, such as cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3), estrogen receptor alpha1 (esr1), chemokine ligand 10 protein (CXCL10), tumor protein p53 (p53), and monoamine oxidase B (Maob), were identified as candidates for future assessments at these AOCs. Overall, this study demonstrates that a better prioritization of contaminants and associated hazards can be achieved through integrated evaluation of multiple lines of evidence. Such prioritization can guide more comprehensive follow-up risk assessment efforts.
Maternal fructose exposure (MFE) programs the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in young adult offspring. Epidemiological data indicate that MetS may increase the risks of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. However, it remains unknown whether MFE programs MetS-associated bladder dysfunction in adult offspring. Using Sprague-Dawley rats, we investigated the effects of MFE during pregnancy and lactation on developmental programming of MetS-associated bladder dysfunction. In addition, next generation sequencing technology was used to identify potential transcripts involved in the programmed bladder dysfunction in adult male offspring to MFE. We found that MFE programmed the MetS-associated OAB symptoms (i.e., an increase in micturition frequency and a shortened mean inter-contractile interval) in young adult male offspring, alongside significant alterations in bladder transcripts, including Chrm2, Chrm3, P2rx1, Trpv4, and Vipr2 gene expression. At protein level, the expressions of M2-, M3-muscarinic and P2X1 receptor proteins were upregulated in the MFE bladder. Functionally, the carbachol-induced detrusor contractility was reduced in the MFE offspring. These data suggest that alterations in the bladder transcripts and impairment of the bladder cholinergic pathways may underlie the pathophysiology of programmed bladder dysfunction in adult offspring to MFE.
Recent reports on acetylcholine muscarinic receptor subtype 3 (CHRM3) have shown its growth-promoting role in prostate cancer. Additional studies report the proliferative effect of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on prostate cancer by its agonistic action on CHRM3. This study shows that the type 1 acetylcholine muscarinic receptor (CHRM1) contributes toward the proliferation and growth of prostate cancer. We used growth and cytotoxic assays, the prostate cancer microarray database and CHRM downstream pathways' homology of CHRM subtypes to uncover multiple signals leading to the growth of prostate cancer. Growth assays showed that pilocarpine stimulates the proliferation of prostate cancer. Moreover, it shows that carbachol exerts an additional agonistic action on nicotinic cholinergic receptor of prostate cancer cells that can be blocked by tubocurarine. With the use of selective CHRM1 antagonists such as pirenzepine and dicyclomine, a considerable inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines was observed in dose ranging from 15-60 µg/ml of dicyclomine. The microarray database of prostate cancer shows a dominant expression of CHRM1 in prostate cancer compared with other cholinergic subtypes. The bioinformatics of prostate cancer and CHRM pathways show that the downstream signalling include PIP3-AKT-CaM-mediated growth in LNCaP and PC3 cells. Our study suggests that antagonism of CHRM1 may be a potential therapeutic target against prostate cancer.
Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is characterized by pinpoint-sized, highly pruritic wheals occurring upon sweating. Both direct and indirect theories in the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) with mast cells have been put forward in the sweating-associated histamine release from mast cells. In the mechanism of indirect involvement of ACh, patients are hypersensitive to sweat antigen(s) and develop wheals in response to sweat substances leaking from the syringeal ducts to the dermis, possibly by obstruction of the ducts. Some patients with CholU exhibit a positive reaction to intradermal injection of their own diluted sweat, representing 'sweat allergy (hypersensitivity)'. Regarding the direct interaction theory between ACh and mast cells, we found that CholU with anhidrosis and hypohidrosis lacks cholinergic receptor M3 (CHRM3) expression in eccrine sweat gland epithelial cells. The expression of CHRM3 is completely absent in the anhidrotic areas and lowly expressed in the hypohidrotic areas. In the hypohidrotic area, where CholU occurs, it is hypothesized that ACh released from nerves cannot be completely trapped by cholinergic receptors of eccrine glands and overflows to the adjacent mast cells, leading to wheals. 
Inspiratory accessory respiratory muscles (ARMs) enhance ventilation when demands are high, such as during exercise and/or pathological conditions. Despite progressive degeneration of phrenic motor neurons innervating the diaphragm, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and rodent models are able to maintain ventilation at early stages of disease. In order to assess the contribution of ARMs to respiratory compensation in ALS, we examined the activity of ARMs and ventilation throughout disease progression in SOD1G93A ALS model mice at rest using a combination of electromyography and unrestrained whole body plethysmography. Increased ARM activity, accompanied by increased ventilation, is observed beginning at the onset of symptoms. However, ARM recruitment fails to occur at rest at late stages of disease, even though the same ARMs are used for other behaviors. Using a chemogenetic approach, we demonstrate that a glutamatergic class of neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, the V2a class, is sufficient to drive increased ARM activity at rest in healthy mice. Additionally, we reveal pathology in the medial reticular formation of the brainstem of SOD1G93A mice using immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. Both spinal and brainstem V2a neurons degenerate in ALS model mice, accompanied by regional activation of astrocytes and microglia. These results establish inspiratory ARM recruitment as one of the compensatory mechanisms that maintains breathing at early stages of disease and indicate that V2a neuron degeneration may contribute to ARM failure at late stages of disease.
The pathophysiology of detrusor underactivity remains unclear and impaired bladder afferent function is considered one of the important etiologies. We investigated urothelial barrier deficits, suburothelial inflammation and sensory proteins expressed in the bladder mucosa of patients with detrusor underactivity.
Bladder mucosa biopsies were performed in 34 patients with videourodynamic proven detrusor underactivity as the study group and in 10 women with stress urinary incontinence as controls. The expression of zona occuldens-1, E-cadherin in the urothelium, tryptase and apoptosis levels in the suburothelium, β3-adrenoceptor, M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors, P2X3 receptor, and inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were compared between study patients and controls.
Study patients included 22 women and 12 men with a mean ± SD age of 56.3 ± 19.7 years, of whom 15 had a history of diabetes. Study patients had significantly lower E-cadherin expression, and a higher number of mast cells and apoptotic cells than controls. Additionally, lower expression of M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors, P2X3 receptors and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was detected in study patients but higher expression of β3-adrenoceptor. In study patients a positive correlation was noted between tryptase and apoptosis levels (r = 0.527) and between the expression of M2 muscarinic receptor and P2X3 receptor (r = 0.403). However, β3-adrenoceptor expression negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression (r = -0.490, each p &lt;0.05).
Urothelial dysfunction, increased suburothelial inflammation and altered sensory protein expressions in bladder mucosa were prominent in patients with detrusor underactivity. Impaired urothelial signaling and sensory transduction pathways appear to reflect the pathophysiology of detrusor underactivity.
Despite increased appreciation for the role of nicotinic receptors in the modulation of and response to inflammation, the contribution of muscarinic receptors to mucosal homeostasis, clearance of enteric pathogens, and modulation of immune cell function remains relatively undefined. Uninfected and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-infected wild-type and type 3 muscarinic receptor (M3R)-deficient (Chrm3(-/-)) mice were studied to determine the contribution of M3R to mucosal homeostasis as well as host defense against the TH2-eliciting enteric nematode N. brasiliensis Intestinal permeability and expression of TH1/TH17 cytokines were increased in uninfected Chrm3(-/-) small intestine. Notably, in Chrm3(-/-) mice infected with N. brasiliensis, small intestinal upregulation of TH2 cytokines was attenuated and nematode clearance was delayed. In Chrm3(-/-) mice, TH2-dependent changes in small intestinal function including smooth muscle hypercontractility, increased epithelial permeability, decreased epithelial secretion and absorption, and goblet cell expansion were absent despite N. brasiliensis infection. These findings identify an important role for M3R in host defense and clearance of N. brasiliensis, and support the expanding role of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in maintaining mucosal homeostasis.
Regulation of prostate epithelial progenitor cells is important in prostate development and prostate diseases. Our previous study demonstrated a function of autocrine cholinergic signaling (ACS) in promoting prostate cancer growth and castration resistance. However, whether or not such ACS also plays a role in prostate development is unknown. Here, we report that ACS promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of prostate epithelial progenitor cells in organotypic cultures. These results were confirmed by ex vivo lineage tracing assays and in vivo renal capsule recombination assays. Moreover, we found that M3 cholinergic receptor (CHRM3) was upregulated in a large subset of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues compared with normal tissues. Activation of CHRM3 also promoted the proliferation of BPH cells. Together, our findings identify a role of ACS in maintaining prostate epithelial progenitor cells in the proliferating state, and blockade of ACS may have clinical implications for the management of BPH.
Developmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) alters reproduction and energy homeostasis, both of which are regulated by the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Little is known about the effects of EDC on ARC gene expression. In Experiment #1, pregnant dams were treated with either two doses of bisphenol A (BPA) or oil from embryonic day (E)18-21. Neonates were injected from postnatal day (PND)0-7. Vaginal opening, body weights, and ARC gene expression were measured. Chrm3 (muscarinic receptor 3) and Adipor1 (adiponectin receptor 1) were decreased by BPA. Bdnf (brain-derived neurotropic factor), Igf1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), Htr2c (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor), and Cck2r (cholescystokinin 2 receptor) were impacted. In Experiment #2, females were exposed to BPA, diethylstilbestrol (DES), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, or methoxychlor (MXC) during E11-PND7. MXC and DES advanced the age of vaginal opening and ARC gene expression was impacted. These data indicate that EDCs alter ARC genes involved in reproduction and energy homeostasis in females.
The genetic influences in human brain structure and function and impaired functional connectivities are the hallmarks of the schizophrenic brain. To explore how common genetic variants affect the connectivities in schizophrenia, we applied genome-wide association studies assaying the abnormal neural connectivities in schizophrenia as quantitative traits.
We recruited 161 first-onset and treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia and 150 healthy controls. All the participants underwent scanning with a 3 T-magnetic resonance imaging scanner to acquire structural and functional imaging data and genotyping using the HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip. The brain-wide association study approach was employed to account for the inherent modular nature of brain connectivities.
We found differences in four abnormal functional connectivities [left rectus to left thalamus (REC.L-THA.L), left rectus to right thalamus (REC.L-THA.R), left superior orbital cortex to left thalamus (ORBsup.L-THA.L) and left superior orbital cortex to right thalamus (ORBsup.L-THA.R)] between the two groups. Univariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association revealed that the SNP rs6800381, located nearest to the CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 3) gene, reached genomic significance (p = 1.768 × 10-8) using REC.L-THA.R as the phenotype. Multivariate gene-based association revealed that the FAM12A (family with sequence similarity 12, member A) gene nearly reached genomic significance (nominal p = 2.22 × 10-6, corrected p = 0.05).
Overall, we identified the first evidence that the CHRM3 gene plays a role in abnormal thalamo-orbital frontal cortex functional connectivity in first-episode treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia. Identification of these genetic variants using neuroimaging genetics provides insights into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help us determine the mechanisms of dysfunction in schizophrenia.
The present study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms used during signal transduction by M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3) in prostate cancer. The microarray datasets of GSE3325, including 5 clinically localized primary prostate cancers and 4 benign prostate tissues, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in primary prostate cancer tissues compared with benign controls were screened using the Limma package. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Next, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with DEGs were predicted and miRNA-target DEG analysis was performed using a Web-based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit. Finally, the PPI network and the miRNA-target DEG network were integrated using Cytoscape. In total, 224 DEGs were screened in the prostate cancer tissues, including 113 upregulated and 111 downregulated genes. CHRM3 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were enriched in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. EGF and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (Myc) were enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. EGF with the highest degree of connectivity was the hub node in the PPI network, and miR-34b could interact with Myc directly in the miRNA-target DEG network. EGF and Myc may exhibit significant roles in the progression of prostate cancer via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the MAPK signaling pathway. CHRM3 may activate these two pathways in prostate cancer progression. Thus, these two key factors and pathways may be crucial mechanisms during signal transduction by CHRM3 in prostate cancer.
Deciphering many roles played by inositol lipids in signal transduction and membrane function demands experimental approaches that can detect their dynamic accumulation with subcellular accuracy and exquisite sensitivity. The former criterion is met by imaging of fluorescence biosensors in living cells, whereas the latter is facilitated by biochemical measurements from populations. Here, we introduce BRET-based biosensors able to detect rapid changes in inositol lipids in cell populations with both high sensitivity and subcellular resolution in a single, convenient assay. We demonstrate robust and sensitive measurements of PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dynamics, as well as changes in cytoplasmic Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels. Measurements were made during either experimental activation of lipid degradation, or PI 3-kinase and phospholipase C mediated signal transduction. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated synthesis of PtdIns4P that accompanies moderate activation of phospholipase C signaling downstream of both EGF and muscarinic M3 receptor activation. This signaling-induced PtdIns4P synthesis relies on protein kinase C, and implicates a feedback mechanism in the control of inositol lipid metabolism during signal transduction. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common preventable and treatable disease, characterized by persistent airflow limitation not fully reversible. However, a number of patients with COPD respond to bronchodilator agents. Some studies have shown polymorphisms in the b2-adrenergic (ADRb2) and muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors (CHRM) that may participate in the modulation of the receptor responses. This study was designed to investigate the existence and the role of adrenergic and muscarinic receptor polymorphisms and their functional impact in COPD. Eighty-two patients with COPD and 17 healthy smokers were recruited and screened for ADRb2 (T164I and R175R), for CHRM2 (rs1824024) and for CHRM3 (-513C/A and -492C/T). Among the polymorphisms studied our results was not able to demonstrate statistically significant association between the polymorphisms studied and COPD risk. Contrarily, we identified, in our COPD population, a significant association with the CHRM2 (rs1824024) polymorphism and disease severity, with lower lung function test values, frequent exacerbations, and poor response to anti-cholinergic drugs. These results suggest the potential role of receptor polymorphism assessment to discriminate newly COPD phenotypes. J. Cell. Physiol. 231: 1745-1751, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 
Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy. Searching for a new molecule to more accurately predict survival of patients and act as therapy target is urgent. CHRM3 is a major player in many kinds of cancer. The expression level and prognostic value of CHRM3 in endometrial carcinoma remain unclear. In this study, we assayed the expression of CHRM3 in 257 endometrial carcinoma patients by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that CHRM3 expression level was closely correlated with the FIGO stage, vascular invasion and lymphatic metastasis. Although CHRM3 was highly expressed in advanced endometrial carcinoma, multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that CHRM3 expression was not an independent prognostic factor for endometrial carcinoma. Furthermore, to evaluate the prognostic efficiency of CHRM3 in endometrial carcinoma, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of CHRM3 in endometrial carcinoma prognosis by logistic regression. The result showed that CHRM3 combining with other clinicopathological risk factors was a stronger prognostic model than clinicopathological risk factor alone or combination of risk factors. Thus, CHRM3 potentially offers a clinical value in target therapy for endometrial carcinoma patients. 
To examine whether the inter-individual variation in constipation among patients receiving opioids for cancer pain is associated with genetic or non-genetic factors.
Cancer patients receiving opioids were included from 17 centers in 11 European countries. Intensity of constipation was reported by 1,568 patients on a four-point categorical scale. Non-genetic factors were included as covariates in stratified regression analyses on the association between constipation and 75 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 15 candidate genes related to opioid- or constipation-signaling pathways (HTR3E, HTR4, HTR2A, TPH1, ADRA2A, CHRM3, TACR1, CCKAR, KIT, ARRB2, GHRL, ABCB1, COMT, OPRM1, and OPRD1).
The non-genetic factors significantly associated with constipation were type of laxative, mobility and place of care among patients receiving laxatives (N=806), in addition to Karnofsky performance status and presence of metastases among patients not receiving laxatives (N=762) (P&lt;0.01). Age, gender, body mass index, cancer diagnosis, time on opioids, opioid dose, and type of opioid did not contribute to the inter-individual differences in constipation. Five SNPs, rs1800532 in TPH1, rs1799971 in OPRM1, rs4437575 in ABCB1, rs10802789 in CHRM3, and rs2020917 in COMT were associated with constipation (P&lt;0.01). Only rs2020917 in COMT passed the Benjamini-Hochberg criterion for a 10% false discovery rate.
Type of laxative, mobility, hospitalization, Karnofsky performance status, presence of metastases, and five SNPs within TPH1, OPRM1, ABCB1, CHRM3, and COMT may contribute to the variability in constipation among cancer patients treated with opioids. Knowledge of these factors may help to develop new therapies and to identify patients needing a more individualized approach to treatment.
We explored the genetic variants that were associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by genome-wide association study (GWAS) and evaluated the association of genetic risk scores (GRS) of the selected genetic variants with insulin resistance and the interaction of the GRS with nutrient intake to develop insulin resistance.
The 6 genetic variants involved in brain and nervous system (acid sensing ion channel subunit 2 rs8071961, rs1988598, and rs16589, macro domain containing 2 rs7262810 CHRM3 rs1867265 and chromosome 2 open reading frame 83 rs11889798) were selected from a GWAS of the PCOS study. GRS of the 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated in 3,723 Korean women in the Ansan/Ansung cohort of KARE study.
Fasting serum insulin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and psychological stress levels were significantly higher in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group. However, serum-free T4 levels were significantly lower in the high-GRS group. HOMA-IR and CRP were higher OR (1.129 and 1.382) in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group after adjusted for covariates. There was a significant interaction between GRS and daily energy intake (p = 0.004). The OR (1.233) for HOMA-IR was higher in the high-GRS group than the low-GRS group only in the group with lower energy intakes based on estimated energy requirement.
Women with high-GRS for PCOS had increased risk of insulin resistance and low energy intake did not protect against the elevation of insulin resistance in women with high GRS. Low energy intake might be protective against PCOS in carriers with low and medium GRS.
Large sample GWAS is needed to identify genetic factors associated with depression. This study used genome-wide genotypic and phenotypic data from the COPDGene study to identify genetic risk factors for depression.
Data were from 9716 COPDGene subjects with ≥10 pack-year history. Depression was defined as antidepressant use and/or a HADS depression subscale score ≥8. Non-Hispanic White (6576) and African-American (3140) subsets were analyzed. A GWAS pipeline identified SNPs associated with depression in each group. Network analysis software analyzed gene interactions through common biological pathways, genetic interactions, and tissue-specific gene expression.
The mean age was 59.4 years (SD 9.0) with 46.5% female subjects. Depression was in 24.7% of the NHW group (1622) and 12.5% of the AA group (391). No SNPs had genome-wide significance. One of the top SNPs, rs12036147 (p = 1.28 × 10-6), is near CHRM3. Another SNP was near MDGA2 (rs17118176, p = 3.52 × 10-6). Top genes formed networks for synaptic transmission with a statistically significant level of more co-expression in brain than other tissues, particularly in the basal ganglia (p = 1.00 × 10-4).
Limitations included a depression definition based on antidepressant use and a limited HADS score subgroup, which could increase false negatives in depressed patients not on antidepressants. Antidepressants used for smoking cessation in non-depressed patients could lead to false positives.
Systems biology analysis identified statistically significant pathways whereby multiple genes influence depression. The gene set pathway analysis and COPDGene data can help investigate depression in future studies.
Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) abound in the central nervous system of vertebrates. Muscarinic AChRs (mAChRs), a functional subclass of AChRs, mediate neuronal responses via intracellular signal transduction. They also play roles in sensorimotor coordination and motor skill learning by enhancing cortical plasticity. Learned birdsong is a complex motor skill acquired through sensorimotor coordination during a critical period. However, the functions of AChRs in the neural circuits for vocal learning and production remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the unique expression of mAChRs subunits (chrm2-5) in the song nuclei of zebra finches. The expression of excitatory subunits (chrm3 and chrm5) was downregulated in the song nuclei compared with the surrounding brain regions. In contrast, the expression of inhibitory mAChRs (chrm2 and chrm4) was upregulated in the premotor song nucleus HVC relative to the surrounding nidopallium. Chrm4 showed developmentally different expression in HVC during the critical period. Compared with chrm4, individual differences in chrm2 expression emerged in HVC early in the critical period. These individual differences in chrm2 expression persisted despite testosterone administration or auditory deprivation, which altered the timing of song stabilization. Instead, the variability in chrm2 expression in HVC correlated with parental genetics. In addition, chrm2 expression in HVC exhibited species differences and individual variability among songbird species. These results suggest that mAChRs play an underappreciated role in the development of species and individual differences in song patterns by modulating the excitability of HVC neurons, providing a potential insight into the gating of auditory responses in HVC neurons.
Clozapine impairs gastrointestinal motility owing to its anticholinergic and antiserotonergic properties. This commonly leads to constipation and potentially to more severe complications such as bowel obstruction and ischemia. The aim of this study was to determine whether genetic variations in the genes encoding muscarinic and serotonergic receptors (CHRM2, CHRM3, HTR2, HTR3, HTR4, and HTR7) explain the variations in incidence of constipation and anticholinergic symptoms during clozapine treatment. Genes associated with opiate-induced constipation were also included in this analysis (TPH1, OPRM1, ABCB1, and COMT).
Blood samples from 176 clozapine-treated, Finnish, white patients with schizophrenia were genotyped. Constipation and anticholinergic symptoms were rated using the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale self-report questionnaire. In total, 192 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and grouped to formulate a weighted genetic-risk score (GRS).
No significant associations between individual SNPs or GRSs and constipation or laxative use were observed. A GRS of 19 SNPs in CHRM2, CHRM3, HTR3C, HTR7, ABCB1, OPRM1, and TPH1 was associated with anticholinergic symptoms in a generalized linear univariate model, with body mass index, clozapine monotherapy, and GRS as explaining variables (permuted P = 0.014). Generalized linear univariate model analysis performed on the opiate-induced constipation-associated SNPs and a single CHRM3 SNP revealed an association between anticholinergic symptoms and a score of 8 SNPs (adjusted P = 0.038, permuted P = 0.002).
Two GRSs are able to predict the risk of anticholinergic symptoms in patients receiving clozapine and possibly an increased risk of gastrointestinal hypomotility.
Attenuated Ca2+-activated Cl- secretion has previously been observed in the model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Prior studies have implicated dysfunctional muscarinic signaling from basolateral membranes as the potential perpetrator leading to decreased Ca2+-activated Cl- secretion. However, in our chronic model of DSS-colitis, cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 ( Chrm3) transcript (1.028 ± 0.12 vs. 1.029 ± 0.27, P &gt; 0.05) and CHRM3 protein expression (1.021 ± 0.24 vs. 0.928 ± 0.09, P &gt; 0.05) were unchanged. Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased carbachol (CCH)-stimulated Cl- secretion in DSS-induced colitis could be attributed to a loss of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCC) in apical membranes of colonic epithelium. To establish this chemically-induced colitis, Balb/C mice were exposed to 4% DSS for five alternating weeks to stimulate a more moderate, chronic colitis. Upon completion of the protocol, whole thickness sections of colon were mounted in an Ussing chamber under voltage-clamp conditions. DSS-induced colitis demonstrated a complete inhibition of basolateral administration of CCH-stimulated Cl- secretion that actually displayed a reversal in polarity (15.40 ± 2.22 μA/cm2 vs. -2.47 ± 0.25 μA/cm2). Western blotting of potential CaCCs, quantified by densitometric analysis, demonstrated no change in bestrophin-2 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, whereas anoctamin-1 [ANO1, transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A)] was significantly downregulated (1.001 ± 0.13 vs. 0.510 ± 0.12, P &lt; 0.05). Our findings indicate that decreased expression of TMEM16A in DSS-induced colitis contributes to the decreased Ca2+-activated Cl- secretion in murine colon.
Pleiotropy, the effect of one variant on multiple traits, is widespread in complex diseases. Joint analysis of multiple traits can improve statistical power to detect genetic variants and uncover the underlying genetic mechanism. Currently, a large number of existing methods target one common variant or only rare variants. Increasing evidence shows that complex diseases are caused by common and rare variants. Here we propose a region-based method to test both rare and common variant associated multiple traits based on variable reduction method (abbreviated as MULVR). However, in the presence of noise traits, the MULVR method may lose power, so we propose the MULVR-O method, which jointly analyses the optimal number of traits associated with genetic variants by the MULVR method, to guard against the effect of noise traits. Extensive simulation studies show that our proposed method (MULVR-O) is applied to not only multiple quantitative traits but also qualitative traits, and is more powerful than several other comparison methods in most scenarios. An application to the two genes (SHBG and CHRM3) and two phenotypes (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) from the GAW19 dataset illustrates that our proposed methods (MULVR and MULVR-O) are feasible and efficient as a region-based method.
Expression and activation of subtype-3 muscarinic receptors (M3R) plays an important role in the progression of colorectal neoplasia.
Herein, we describe the role of muscarinic receptors in colon cancer, focusing specifically on M3R, illustrate how M3R over-expression and activation of post-receptor signaling pathways potentiates tumor progression, and explore the efficacy and safety of a variety of therapeutic approaches that can target the molecules involved.
Colon cancers overexpress M3R mRNA (CHRM3) and protein, and post-M3R signaling stimulates cell proliferation. Post-M3R signal transduction is complex, involving interplay between epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)/ERK and protein kinase C (PKC)/p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. In particular, the development of an invasive and metastatic phenotype requires that these signaling interactions augment cellular release of a key collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1). Blocking either M3R activation or post-M3R signaling attenuates MMP1 release and colon cancer invasiveness.
Parsing the complexities of these signaling interactions is important, not only to understand these mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression, but also to develop novel treatment modalities. Since the vast majority of persons with colon cancer die from disseminated disease, preventing or reversing metastatic spread of cancer cells by targeting M3R, post-M3R signaling, or MMP1 has therapeutic potential.
The risk of serious congenital anomaly for de novo balanced translocations is estimated to be at least 6%. We identified two apparently independent families with a balanced t(1;12)(q43;q21.1) as an outcome of a "Systematic Survey of Balanced Chromosomal Rearrangements in Finns." In the first family, carriers (n = 6) manifest with learning problems in childhood, and later with unexplained neurological symptoms (chronic headache, balance problems, tremor, fatigue) and cerebral infarctions in their 50s. In the second family, two carriers suffer from tetralogy of Fallot, one from transient ischemic attack and one from migraine. The translocation cosegregates with these vascular phenotypes and neurological symptoms.
We narrowed down the breakpoint regions using mate pair sequencing. We observed conserved haplotypes around the breakpoints, pointing out that this translocation has arisen only once. The chromosome 1 breakpoint truncates a CHRM3 processed transcript, and is flanked by the 5' end of CHRM3 and the 3' end of RYR2. TRHDE, KCNC2, and ATXN7L3B flank the chromosome 12 breakpoint.
This study demonstrates a balanced t(1;12)(q43;q21.1) with conserved haplotypes on the derived chromosomes. The translocation seems to result in vascular phenotype, with or without neurological symptoms, in at least two families. We suggest that the translocation influences the positional expression of CHRM3, RYR2, TRHDE, KCNC2, and/or ATXN7L3B.
Numerous genetic loci have been identified as being associated with circulating fatty acid (FA) levels and/or inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular health (e.g., C-reactive protein). Recently, using red blood cell (RBC) FA data from the Framingham Offspring Study, we conducted a genome-wide association study of over 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 22 RBC FAs (and associated ratios), including the four Omega-3 FAs (ALA, DHA, DPA, and EPA). Our analyses identified numerous causal loci. In this manuscript, we investigate the extent to which polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels moderate the relationship of genetics to cardiovascular health biomarkers using a genome-wide interaction study approach. In particular, we test for possible gene-FA interactions on 9 inflammatory biomarkers, with 2.5 million SNPs and 12 FAs, including all Omega-3 PUFAs. We identified eighteen novel loci, including loci which demonstrate strong evidence of modifying the impact of heritable genetics on biomarker levels, and subsequently cardiovascular health. The identified genes provide increased clarity on the biological functioning and role of Omega-3 PUFAs, as well as other common fatty acids, in cardiovascular health, and suggest numerous candidate loci for future replication and biological characterization.
Inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] represent a challenging health issue with a complex aetiology involving genetic and environmental parameters. Although our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD has improved, much remains to be explored. In this context, bioactive lipids, more specifically oxysterols, i.e. oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, represent an interesting avenue to investigate. Indeed, oxysterols or their receptors are involved in inflammation and immune regulation. Therefore, we set out to study the oxysterome in IBD.
We used both high-performance liquid chromatograph/mass spectroscopy and molecular biology tools to quantify oxysterol levels and the expression of their metabolic enzymes in several models of murine colitis [both acute and chronic], as well as in colon biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
We found that the oxysterome is altered in IBD, in both acute and chronic murine models as well as in human IBD. Two of the oxysterols quantified, 4β-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, were consistently altered in all our models and therefore could be of interest in this context. Hence, we administered them to mice with colitis. While 25-hydroxycholesterol had no effect, 4β-hydroxycholesterol worsened colon inflammation.
Our study addresses the potential involvement of oxysterols in colitis and clearly points towards an active role as well as a clinical relevance for these bioactive lipids.
A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS) assay was developed and qualified for analyzing 35 analytes of the cholesterol metabolism, including free cholesterol, 17 free, non-esterified oxysterols and 17 free and conjugated bile acids in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. As internal standards, 25 commercially available stable deuterium-labeled analogs of the analytes were used. Pre-analytical investigations included stability tests of analyte concentrations affected by different anticoagulation additives: lithium heparin-, citrate-, EDTA-K3-stabilized plasma and serum, and the stability in EDTA whole blood at RT. This LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the analysis of paired serum/cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with and without blood-brain barrier disturbance, as well as of 100 plasma samples of a LIFE-Adult study sub-cohort. A fast and simple sample preparation including protein precipitation and on-line solid-phase extraction was developed. As little as 55 μL of human plasma/serum or cerebrospinal fluid were needed for the analysis. It was possible to separate isomeric oxysterols and bile acids within 23 min using a C18 core-shell column. The assay is capable of quantifying in a linear range of 0.8-250 ng mL-1 for free hydroxycholesterols, 0.2-10 ng mL-1 for dihydroxycholesterols, 0.2-500 ng mL-1 for bile acids and 16-2000 μg mL-1 for cholesterol with acceptable accuracy and precision. In cerebrospinal fluid one free oxysterols, five free and five conjugated bile acids could be quantified. No significant differences between patients with and without blood-brain barrier disturbance were obtained. In the LIFE-Adult sub-cohort two free oxysterols, four free and seven conjugated bile acids could be quantified in EDTA plasma. Men showed significantly higher concentrations of 26-OHC than women (p = 0.035). Furthermore, in women lower levels of cholic acid, glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, glycolithocholic acid and higher levels of taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid/hyodeoxycholic acid were quantified.
Cholesterol is a vital lipid molecule for mammalian cells, regulating fluidity of biological membranes, and serving as an essential constituent of lipid rafts. Mammalian cells acquire cholesterol from extracellular lipoproteins and from de novo synthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis generates various precursor sterols. Cholesterol undergoes metabolic conversion into oxygenated sterols (oxysterols), bile acids, and steroid hormones. Cholesterol intermediates and metabolites have diverse and important cellular functions. A network of molecular machineries including transcription factors, protein modifiers, sterol transporters/carriers, and sterol sensors regulate sterol homeostasis in mammalian cells and tissues. Dysfunction in metabolism and transport of cholesterol, sterol intermediates, and oxysterols occurs in various pathophysiological settings such as atherosclerosis, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the cholesterol, intermediate sterol, and oxysterol regulatory mechanisms and intracellular transport machineries, and discuss the roles of sterols and sterol metabolism in human diseases.
The steroid hormones progestagens, estrogens, androgens, and glucocorticoids as well as their precursor cholesterol are required for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and proper development of the fetus. The human placenta forms at the interface of maternal and fetal circulation. It participates in biosynthesis and metabolism of steroids as well as their regulated exchange between maternal and fetal compartment. This review outlines the mechanisms of human placental handling of steroid compounds. Cholesterol is transported from mother to offspring involving lipoprotein receptors such as low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SRB1) as well as ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. Additionally, cholesterol is also a precursor for placental progesterone and estrogen synthesis. Hormone synthesis is predominantly performed by members of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzyme family including CYP11A1 or CYP19A1 and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) such as 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD. Placental estrogen synthesis requires delivery of sulfate-conjugated precursor molecules from fetal and maternal serum. Placental uptake of these precursors is mediated by members of the solute carrier (SLC) family including sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1). Maternal-fetal glucocorticoid transport has to be tightly regulated in order to ensure healthy fetal growth and development. For that purpose, the placenta expresses the enzymes 11β-HSD 1 and 2 as well as the transporter ABCB1. This article also summarizes the impact of diverse compounds and diseases on the expression level and activity of the involved transporters, receptors, and metabolizing enzymes and concludes that the regulatory mechanisms changing the physiological to a pathophysiological state are barely explored. The structure and the cellular composition of the human placental barrier are introduced. While steroid production, metabolism and transport in the placental syncytiotrophoblast have been explored for decades, few information is available for the role of placental-fetal endothelial cells in these processes. With regard to placental structure and function, significant differences exist between species. To further decipher physiologic pathways and their pathologic alterations in placental steroid handling, proper model systems are mandatory.
24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) and Tau are produced in neuronal cells and neurodegeneration leads to increased flux of both of them into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the present study, CSF levels of 24OHC and 27S-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) along with those of Tau, P-Thr181-Tau and Aβ42 were measured in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD), Corticobasal syndrome (CBS), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and controls. Using mouse models with increased or no formation of Tau protein and increased production of 24OHC, we have also tested the hypothesis that there is a direct association between neuronal turnover of 24OHC and Tau. The levels of 24OHC are increased, at a group level, in patients with PD or CBS. We found significant correlations between levels of 24OHC and Tau or P-Thr181-Tau in CSF from patients with PD, CBS or CBD. There were no similar correlations between 24OHC and Aβ42 in CSF from these patients. The neuronal levels of 24OHC were not altered in Tau knockout or Tau overexpressing mice. Vice versa, Tau species levels were not changed in Cyp46 overexpressing mice with increased neuronal levels of 24OHC. We conclude that the strongly correlative fluxes of 24OHC and Tau from neuronal cells to CSF are likely to be secondary to neurodegeneration and not due to direct interaction between the two factors. We suggest that this high correlation reflects a rapid neurodegeneration of specific neuronal subtypes with simultaneous release of 24OHC and Tau into the CSF.
Although 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) plays an important role to maintain homeostasis of cholesterol in the brain, it induces neuronal cell death at high concentrations. 24S-OHC-induced cell death was suppressed by γ-tocopherol (γ-Toc) but not by γ-tocotrienol (γ-Toc3) in a similar way to α-tocopherol (α-Toc) and α-tocotrienol (α-Toc3) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Both γ-Toc and γ-Toc3 significantly inhibited cumene hydroperoxide-induced cell death, as previously shown in the case of α-Toc and α-Toc3. Lipid droplet-like structure formation induced by 24S-OHC was suppressed by neither γ-Toc nor γ-Toc3. The phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was induced by 24S-OHC, which was suppressed by CaMKII phosphorylation-site inhibitor mM3 but not by calmodulin-binding-site inhibitor KN62. A calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, inhibited calcium ionophore A23187-induced CaMKII phosphorylation but not 24S-OHC-induced CaMKII phosphorylation. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) phosphorylation induced by 24S-OHC was not inhibited by either mM3 or KN62, suggesting that CaMKII activation does not affect RIPK1 phosphorylation. Knockdown of RIPK1 using siRNA induced not only inhibition of CaMKII phosphorylation but also reduction of total CaMKII protein levels, suggesting that RIPK1 may regulate CaMKII signalling. 24S-OHC-induced RIPK1 phosphorylation was inhibited by neither α-Toc nor α-Toc3. In contrast, CaMKII phosphorylation induced by 24S-OHC was significantly suppressed by α-Toc but not by α-Toc3. These results suggest that CaMKII activation is involved in the mechanism of 24S-OHC-induced cell death and that Toc inhibits the cell death via inhibition of CaMKII activation through a RIPK1 phosphorylation-independent pathway.
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers and is the second-leading cause of cancer-associated morbidity worldwide. Oxysterols are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol that may be important in many biological processes, but the levels and roles of oxysterols in gastric tumours remain to be elucidated. The levels of cholesterol, oxysterols and sulfated oxysterols in human gastric tumour tissues, adjacent normal mucosal tissues, cancerous gastric juice and gastric juice obtained from healthy subjects were detected by LC-MS. It was found that the levels of 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC in human gastric tumour tissues and cancerous gastric juice were significantly increased compared with those of adjacent normal mucosal tissues and gastric juice from healthy subjects. Compared with normal gastric mucosal tissue, the levels of sulfated 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC3S) and the ratio of 25HC3S/25HC were decreased in human gastric tumour tissues, which might be related to the dramatically decreased SULT2A1 expression in gastric tumour tissue. Both 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC suppressed gastric cancer proliferation, which was not altered by LXRα-siRNA treatment. The suppression of cell proliferation induced by 27HC was attenuated by LXRβ-siRNA, but the suppression of cell proliferation induced by 24(R/S),25-EC was intensified by LXRβ-siRNA. Both 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC dramatically inhibited HGC-27 cell migration, which was attenuated by the co-transfection of cells with LXRα-siRNA and LXRβ-siRNA, but not LXRα-siRNA or LXRβ-siRNA alone. In conclusion, the accumulated 24(R/S),25-EC and 27HC in human gastric tumour tissues might play important roles in gastric cancer development.
Recent studies have shown that the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A phenotype marker 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol (4βOHC/C) ratio is negatively correlated with body weight in healthy volunteers, and that obese patients have lower 4βOHC levels than healthy controls. However, 4βOHC/C ratio in underweight patients has yet to be reported. The aim of this study was to examine potential differences in CYP3A activity between underweight patients with anorexia nervosa and normal-weight volunteers by measuring plasma 4βOHC/C ratio. Furthermore, we wished to describe any association between body mass index (BMI) and 4βOHC/C ratio in underweight patients. A total of 20 underweight patients and 16 normal-weight volunteers were included in the study, all females. Underweight patients had a median 4βOHC/C ratio (molar ratio × 10-5) of 2.52 (range, 0.90-11.3) compared to 1.29 (0.56-2.09) in normal-weight subjects (Mann-Whitney P = 0.0005). 4βOHC/C ratio was negatively correlated with BMI in underweight patients (r = -0.56, P = 0.011), and in the whole study population (r = -0.67, P &lt; 0.0001). This suggests that the negative correlation between 4βOHC/C and BMI, which has previously been reported between 4βOHC/C and body weight in healthy volunteers, extends to underweight patients. The findings indicate that CYP3A activity increases with decreasing BMI, resulting in higher CYP3A activity in underweight patients compared to normal-weight subjects. The potential clinical relevance of this needs to be studied further by comparing pharmacokinetics of drugs subjected to CYP3A-mediated metabolism in underweight vs. normal-weight individuals.
A novel innate immune strategy, involving specific cholesterol oxidation products as effectors, has begun to reveal connections between cholesterol metabolism and immune response against viral infections. Indeed, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), physiologically produced by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol, act as inhibitors of a wide spectrum of enveloped and non-enveloped human viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying their protective effects against non-enveloped viruses are almost completely unexplored. To get insight into this field, we investigated the antiviral activity of 25HC and 27HC against a non-enveloped virus causing acute gastroenteritis in children, the human rotavirus (HRV). We found that 25HC and 27HC block the infectivity of several HRV strains at 50% inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range in the absence of cell toxicity. Both molecules affect the final step of virus penetration into cells by preventing the association of two cellular proteins: the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-A (VAP-A). By altering the activity of these cellular mediators, 25HC and 27HC disturb the recycling of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum and the late endosomes which are exploited by HRV to penetrate into the cell. The substantial accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosomal compartment results in sequestering viral particles inside these vesicles thereby preventing cytoplasmic virus replication. These findings suggest that cholesterol oxidation products of enzymatic origin might be primary effectors of host restriction strategies to counteract HRV infection and point to redox active lipids involvement in viral infections as a research area of focus to better focus in order to identify novel antiviral agents targets.
Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) and arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, type B (ALOX15B) catalyze the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and are upregulated in human alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) induced by Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and/or interleukin-13. Known primarily for roles in bioactive lipid mediator synthesis, 15-lipoxygenases (15-LOXs) have been implicated in various macrophage functions including efferocytosis and ferroptosis. Using a combination of inhibitors and siRNAs to suppress 15-LOX isoforms, we studied the role of 15-LOXs in cellular cholesterol homeostasis and immune function in naïve and AAMs. Silencing or inhibiting the 15-LOX isoforms impaired sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 signaling by inhibiting SREBP-2 processing into mature transcription factor and reduced SREBP-2 binding to sterol regulatory elements and subsequent target gene expression. Silencing ALOX15B reduced cellular cholesterol and the cholesterol intermediates desmosterol, lanosterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, and lathosterol as well as oxysterols in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. In addition, attenuating both 15-LOX isoforms did not generally affect IL-4 gene expression but rather uniquely impacted IL-4-induced CCL17 production in an SREBP-2-dependent manner resulting in reduced T cell migration to macrophage conditioned media. In conclusion, we identified a novel role for ALOX15B, and to a lesser extent ALOX15, in cholesterol homeostasis and CCL17 production in human macrophages.
Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness among people over 50 years of age, is characterized by atrophic neurodegeneration or pathologic angiogenesis. Early AMD is characterized by extracellular cholesterol-rich deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) called drusen or in the subretinal space called subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) that drive disease progression. However, mechanisms of drusen and SDD biogenesis remain poorly understood. Although human AMD is characterized by abnormalities in cholesterol homeostasis and shares phenotypic features with atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether systemic immunity or local tissue metabolism regulates this homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that targeted deletion of macrophage cholesterol ABC transporters A1 (ABCA1) and -G1 (ABCG1) leads to age-associated extracellular cholesterol-rich deposits underneath the neurosensory retina similar to SDD seen in early human AMD. These mice also develop impaired dark adaptation, a cardinal feature of RPE cell dysfunction seen in human AMD patients even before central vision is affected. Subretinal deposits in these mice progressively worsen with age, with concomitant accumulation of cholesterol metabolites including several oxysterols and cholesterol esters causing lipotoxicity that manifests as photoreceptor dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that impaired macrophage cholesterol transport initiates several key elements of early human AMD, demonstrating the importance of systemic immunity and aging in promoting disease manifestation. Polymorphisms in genes involved with cholesterol transport and homeostasis are associated with a significantly higher risk of developing AMD, thus making these studies translationally relevant by identifying potential targets for therapy.
Invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC) is a histological subtype of breast cancer that is characterized by loss of E-cadherin and high expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In many cases, ILC is effectively treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs); however, acquired AI resistance remains a significant problem.
To identify underlying mechanisms of acquired anti-estrogen resistance in ILC, we recently developed six long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) variant cell lines from the human ILC cell lines SUM44PE (SUM44; two lines) and MDA-MB-134VI (MM134; four lines). To better understand mechanisms of AI resistance in these models, we performed transcriptional profiling analysis by RNA-sequencing followed by candidate gene expression and functional studies.
MM134 LTED cells expressed ER at a decreased level and lost growth response to estradiol, while SUM44 LTED cells retained partial ER activity. Our transcriptional profiling analysis identified shared activation of lipid metabolism across all six independent models. However, the underlying basis of this signature was distinct between models. Oxysterols were able to promote the proliferation of SUM44 LTED cells but not MM134 LTED cells. In contrast, MM134 LTED cells displayed a high expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a regulator of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, and were hypersensitive to genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SREBPs. Several SREBP1 downstream targets involved in fatty acid synthesis, including FASN, were induced, and MM134 LTED cells were more sensitive to etomoxir, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in beta-oxidation, than their respective parental control cells. Finally, in silico expression analysis in clinical specimens from a neo-adjuvant endocrine trial showed a significant association between the increase of SREBP1 expression and lack of clinical response, providing further support for a role of SREBP1 in the acquisition of endocrine resistance in breast cancer.
Our characterization of a unique series of AI-resistant ILC models identifies the activation of key regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, implicating lipid-metabolic processes driving estrogen-independent growth of ILC cells. Targeting these changes may prove a strategy for prevention and treatment of endocrine resistance for patients with ILC.
Equine neuroaxonal dystrophy/equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy (eNAD/EDM) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting genetically predisposed foals maintained on an α-tocopherol (α-TOH) deficient diet. Currently no antemortem diagnostic test for eNAD/EDM is available.
Because α-TOH deficiency is associated with increased lipid peroxidation, it was hypothesized that F2 -isoprostanes (F2 IsoP), F4 -neuroprostanes (F4 NP) and oxysterols derived from free radical oxidation would be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neural tissue of eNAD/EDM affected horses and could serve as potential biomarkers for disease.
Isoprostane Study A: 14 Quarter horse foals (10 healthy foals and 4 eNAD/EDM affected foals) at 1 and 6 months of age. Isoprostane Study B: 17 eNAD/EDM affected and 10 unaffected horses ≥ 1-4 years of age. Oxysterol study: eNAD/EDM affected (n = 14, serum; n = 11, CSF; n = 10, spinal cord [SC]) and unaffected horses 1-4 years of age (n = 12, serum; n = 10, CSF; n = 7, SC).
Cerebrospinal fluid [F2 IsoP] and [F4 NP] were assessed using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Serum, CSF, and cervical SC [oxysterols] were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results were compared with respective α-TOH concentrations.
Spinal cord [7-ketocholesterol], [7-hydroxycholesterol], and [7-keto-27-hydrocholesterol] were higher in eNAD/EDM horses whereas [24-ketocholesterol] was lower. No significant difference was found in CSF [F2 IsoP] and [F4 NP], serum [oxysterols] and CSF [oxysterols] between eNAD/EDM affected and unaffected horses. No correlation was found between [F2 IsoP], [F4 NP], or [oxysterols] and respective [α-TOH].
In the SC, targeted markers of cholesterol oxidation were significantly increased in horses with eNAD/EDM.
Epidemiologic studies are controversial concerning the roles played by cholesterol in cancer risk and development, possibly as it is not cholesterol per se that is pathologic in cancers. Indeed, recent data reveal that the cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells can generate endogenous oncopromoter metabolites at higher levels compared with normal tissues and/or can be deregulated in the production of endogenous oncosuppressor metabolites in an opposite way. These metabolites are oxysterols, which are cholesterol oxygenation products generated by enzymatic and/or autoxidation processes. All these oxysterols are new classes of estrogen, glucocorticoid, or liver X nuclear receptor ligands, and their protumor action on their cognate receptors could explain some drug resistance, while treatment with antitumor metabolites could complement their deficiency in cancers and restore their action on their nuclear receptor. Given that hypercholesterolemia and high intakes of cholesterol-rich foods or processed foods can generate these oxysterols, their importance in cancer risk or development in overweight and obese people is to be considered. The discovery of these cholesterol-derived metabolites and the identification of the nuclear receptors mediating their pro- or antitumor activities are important findings, which should have major implications in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of different cancers and open new areas of research.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory cholangiopathy frequently complicated by cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Massive proliferation of biliary tree stem/progenitor cells (BTSCs), expansion of peribiliary glands (PBGs), and dysplasia were observed in PSC. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the involvement of PBGs and BTSCs in CCA which emerged in PSC patients. Specimens from normal liver (n = 5), PSC (n = 20), and PSC-associated CCA (n = 20) were included. Samples were processed for histology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. In vitro experiments were performed on human BTSCs, human mucinous primary CCA cell cultures, and human cholangiocyte cell lines (H69). Our results indicated that all CCAs emerging in PSC patients were mucin-producing tumors characterized by PBG involvement and a high expression of stem/progenitor cell markers. Ducts with neoplastic lesions showed higher inflammation, wall thickness, and PBG activation compared to nonneoplastic PSC-affected ducts. CCA showed higher microvascular density and higher expression of nuclear factor kappa B, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, transforming growth factor β, and vascular endothelial growth factor-1 compared to nonneoplastic ducts. CCA cells were characterized by a higher expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits and by the absence of primary cilia compared to bile ducts and PBG cells in controls and patients with PSC. Our in vitro study demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide and oxysterols (PSC-related stressors) induced the expression of EMT traits, the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, autophagy, and the loss of primary cilia in human BTSCs. Conclusion: CCA arising in patients with PSC is characterized by extensive PBG involvement and by activation of the BTSC niche in these patients, the presence of duct lesions at different stages suggests a progressive tumorigenesis.
Cholesterol homeostasis has a pivotal function in regulating immune cells. Here we show that apolipoprotein E (apoE) deficiency leads to the accumulation of cholesterol in the cell membrane of dendritic cells (DC), resulting in enhanced MHC-II-dependent antigen presentation and CD4+ T-cell activation. Results from WT and apoE KO bone marrow chimera suggest that apoE from cells of hematopoietic origin has immunomodulatory functions, regardless of the onset of hypercholesterolemia. Humans expressing apoE4 isoform (ε4/3-ε4/4) have increased circulating levels of activated T cells compared to those expressing WT apoE3 (ε3/3) or apoE2 isoform (ε2/3-ε2/2). This increase is caused by enhanced antigen-presentation by apoE4-expressing DCs, and is reversed when these DCs are incubated with serum containing WT apoE3. In summary, our study identifies myeloid-produced apoE as a key physiological modulator of DC antigen presentation function, paving the way for further explorations of apoE as a tool to improve the management of immune diseases.
The electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs) have become the most sought-after alternative to the traditional cigarettes, partly due to the widespread perception of safety. However, the high temperature reached by e-cig solutions can generate toxic compounds, some of which are listed as known human carcinogens. To evaluate the impact of e-cig aerosol on rat brain lipid profile, twenty male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 11 cycles/day (E-cig group), to consume 1 mL/day of e-liquid, for 5 days/week up to 8 weeks. Ten rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks (4w) and ten at the end of treatment (8w). The composition of total fatty acids, sterols and oxysterols of the lipid fraction of rat brains, was analyzed. The results of the E-cig group were compared with those of the control group (not exposed). After 8 weeks, the saturated fatty acids significantly raised up to 7.35 mg/g tissue, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased reaching 3.17 mg/g. The e-cig vaping increased both palmitic (3.43 mg/g) and stearic acids (3.82 mg/g), while a significant decrement of arachidonic (1.32 mg/g) and docosahexaenoic acids (1.00 mg/g) was found. Atherogenic (0.5) and thrombogenic (1.12) indices also increased in 8w treated animals. The e-cig aerosol significantly impacted the cholesterol homeostasis, since the latter at 8w (21.57 mg/g) was significantly lower than control (24.56 mg/g); moreover, a significant increase of 7-dehydrocholesterol (1.87 mg/g) was also denoted in e-cig group. The e-cig aerosol also reduced the oxysterol formation (19.55 μg/g) after 4 weeks of exposure, except for triol and 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol (α-EC). The principal component analysis (PCA) separated all E-cig from control groups, evidencing that oxysterols (except triol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-HC)) were inversely correlated to 7-DHC and TI. The present research revealed that e-cigs aerosol affected the lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in rat brain, which could contribute to the new occurrence of some neurodegenerative diseases.
Males are more susceptible than females to infections due to the differences in endocrine-immune interactions. Furthermore, it is reported that lowering cell cholesterol impairs viral replication and infection in vitro. However, the production of oxysterols in vivo by oxidation of cholesterol may result in inhibition of HIV replication. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the associations of gender and serum total cholesterol with CD4+ T cell counts and/or WHO clinical stages, and HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) load in antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive study population with known sero-positive time of stay in Addis Ababa.  METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to August 2013 on 594 HIV-1 infected ART-naïve adult study participants in four hospitals Addis Ababa. CD4+ T-cell count, HIV RNA load, hemoglobin and fasting serum total cholesterol were determined. Socio-demographic characteristics, WHO clinical stages, and height and weight were collected from patients' chart and triangulated by structured questionnaire. Pearson chi-square test, Spearman rank correlation and univariate and multivariate linear/logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine associations.
Mean HIV RNA load was found to be lower in women than in men (p &lt; 0.05). CD4+ T cell count and serum total cholesterol were found to be significantly correlated with HIV RNA load (p &lt; 0.01). Women were at lower risk of having higher HIV RNA load in comparison to men. In addition, having lower concentrations of serum total cholesterol was found to be independent predictor of higher HIV RNA load in comparison to those with higher concentrations of cholesterol in serum (p &lt; 0.05). The multivariate binomial logistic regression also showed that the immune status was better in women than men, and in the presence of higher serum total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.05).
Gender and serum total cholesterol were found to be associated and independent predictors of HIV RNA load, and CD4+ cell count and/or WHO clinical stages. There is a significant lower HIV RNA load and better CD4+ T cell count in women and those study participants with higher serum total cholesterol.
7-Ketocholesterol is a major dietary cholesterol oxidation product found in high concentrations in atherosclerotic plaques, which contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 7-ketocholesterol on endothelial inflammation, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with 7-ketocholesterol significantly enhanced the total interactions between human monocytic cells (THP-1 cell line) and TNFα-activated HUVECs under physiological flow conditions, compared to pretreatment with cholesterol (TNFα+50 μM cholesterol: 13.1 ± 0.54 cells/CPF, TNFα+50 μM 7-ketocholesterol: 18.9 ± 0.35 cells/CPF, p &lt; 0.01). 7-Ketocholesterol enhanced the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 proteins. It also activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor inhibited both E-selectin expression via ATF-2 activation and 7-ketocholesterol-induced THP-1 adhesion to HUVECs. These findings suggest that 7-ketocholesterol enhances leukocyte-endothelial interactions by upregulating the expression of adhesion molecules, presumably via the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway.
Cardiovascular diseases have been associated with stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and accumulation of unfolded proteins leading to the unfolded protein response (UPR). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. ROS have also been associated with ER stress. The role NADPH oxidases in the UPR is, however, not completely resolved yet.
In this study, we investigated the role of p22phox, an essential component of most NADPH oxidases, in the UPR of endothelial cells.
Induction of ER stress increased p22phox expression at the transcriptional level. p22phox was identified as novel target of the UPR transcription factor ATF4 (activator of transcription factor 4) under ER stress conditions by promoter analyses and ChIP. Depletion of ATF4 and p22phox diminished the levels of superoxide and H2O2 under ER stress conditions. On the contrary, p22phox was instrumental in increasing eIF2α phosphorylation and subsequent ATF4 expression on induction of ER stress by chemicals, oxysterols, or severe hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased expression of CHOP and activation of effector caspases.
p22phox is a novel target of ATF4 in response to ER stress, which can promote the PERK-ATF4 branch of the UPR in vitro and in vivo.
p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidases are important mediators of ER stress driving the UPR.
The involvement of organelles in cell death is well established especially for endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and mitochondria. However, the role of the peroxisome is not well known, though peroxisomal dysfunction favors a rupture of redox equilibrium. To study the role of peroxisomes in cell death, 158 N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with 7-ketocholesterol (7 KC: 25-50 μM, 24 h). The highest concentration is known to induce oxiapoptophagy (OXIdative stress + APOPTOsis + autoPHAGY), whereas the lowest concentration does not induce cell death. In those conditions (with 7 KC: 50 μM) morphological, topographical and functional peroxisome alterations associated with modifications of the cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria, with mitochondrial dysfunction (loss of transmembrane mitochondrial potential, decreased level of cardiolipins) and oxidative stress were observed: presence of peroxisomes with abnormal sizes and shapes similar to those observed in Zellweger fibroblasts, lower cellular level of ABCD3, used as a marker of peroxisomal mass, measured by flow cytometry, lower mRNA and protein levels (measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting) of ABCD1 and ABCD3 (two ATP-dependent peroxisomal transporters), and of ACOX1 and MFP2 enzymes, and lower mRNA level of DHAPAT, involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis, respectively, and increased levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA: C24:0, C24:1, C26:0 and C26:1, quantified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry) metabolized by peroxisomal β-oxidation. In the presence of 7 KC (25 μM), slight mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress were found, and no induction of apoptosis was detected; however, modifications of the cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria and clusters of mitochondria were detected. The peroxisomal alterations observed with 7 KC (25 μM) were similar to those with 7 KC (50 μM). In addition, data obtained by transmission electron microcopy and immunofluorescence microscopy by dual staining with antibodies raised against p62, involved in autophagy, and ABCD3, support that 7 KC (25-50 μM) induces pexophagy. 7 KC (25-50 μM)-induced side effects were attenuated by α-tocopherol but not by α-tocotrienol, whereas the anti-oxidant properties of these molecules determined with the FRAP assay were in the same range. These data provide evidences that 7 KC, at concentrations inducing or not cell death, triggers morphological, topographical and functional peroxisomal alterations associated with minor or major mitochondrial changes.
Astaxanthin is a natural red carotene exerting a strong antioxidant action. The effect of this carotene on the oxidative stability of raw and cooked lamb patties was evaluated. Seven experimental treatments were included in this study depending on the antioxidants added, which are: no antioxidant added (control), 450 mg/kg of sodium metabisulphite, 500 mg/kg of sodium ascorbate, and 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg of astaxanthin. The raw patties were either refrigerated for up to 11 days or frozen for 3 months under aerobic conditions. Changes in thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), instrumental colour, pH and Eh were determined in the refrigerated patties and TBARS in the frozen patties. Volatile compounds were determined in cooked patties and cholesterol oxides in both cooked and after cooking microwave reheated patties. The changes in TBARS of cooked patties during a four-day refrigerated storage were also studied. Compared to the control patties, the use of astaxanthin reduced the TBARS generation in a manner depending on the dose for both raw and cooked patties during storage (P &lt; 0.05). Astaxanthin added at levels of 60 and/or 80 mg/kg showed a greater antioxidant effect than ascorbate and metabisulphite. The presence of astaxanthin, like that of ascorbate, decreased the oxysterols levels of cooked patties with regard to controls. The amount of volatiles released from the cooked patties was also reduced by astaxanthin. This effect was not observed for ascorbate or metabisulphite. Astaxanthin in lamb patties at levels of 60-80 mg/kg could improve raw and cooked lamb patty oxidative stability during refrigerated aerobic storage, protect their lipids against thermal degradation more than ascorbate and metabisulphite, and reduce oxysterols formation during cooking in a similar way to ascorbate.
Some oxysterols resulting either from enzymatic oxidation or autoxidation of cholesterol are associated with age-related diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Among these oxysterols, 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC) is often found at increased levels in patients. It is therefore important to identify molecules or mixtures of molecules to prevent 7β-OHC-induced side effects. Consequently, murine oligodendrocytes (158N) were cultured in the absence or presence of 7β-OHC (20 μg/mL, 24 h) with or without a natural oil extracted from sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) eggs known for its biological activity. Firstly, the chemical composition of this oil was determined using 31P NMR and GC-MS. Secondly, this oil was used to reduce 7β-OHC-induced side effects. To this end, the oil (160 μg/mL) was added to the culture medium of 158N cells 2 h before 7β-OHC. The effects of 7β-OHC with or without the oil on cell viability were studied with the MTT test. Photometric methods were used to analyze antioxidant enzyme activities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the generation of lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated dienes (CDs)) and protein oxidation product (carbonylated proteins (CPs)). Gas chromatography was used to determine the fatty acid profile. With 7β-OHC, an induction of cell death associated with oxidative stress (alteration of GPx and SOD activities) was observed; an overproduction of lipid peroxidation products (MDA and CDs) and CPs was also revealed. Sea urchin egg oil attenuated 7β-OHC-induced cytotoxicity: 7β-OHC-induced cell death was reduced, GPx and SOD activities were normalized, and lower levels of MDA, CDs and CPs were produced. In addition, whereas a disturbed fatty acid profile was observed with 7β-OHC, similar fatty acid profiles were found in control cells and in cells cultured with 7β-OHC associated with sea urchin egg oil. These data demonstrate the protective activities of sea urchin egg oil against 7β-OHC-induced side effects on 158N cells, supporting the concept that this oil may have benefits in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.
Cholesterol oxidation products, also named oxysterols, can be formed either by cholesterol auto-oxidation, enzymatically or both. Among these oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) is mainly formed during radical attacks that take place on the carbon 7 of cholesterol. As increased levels of 7KC have been found in the tissues, plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with major diseases, especially age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, eye diseases, neurodegenerative diseases), some cancers, and chronic inflammatory diseases, it is suspected that 7KC, could contribute to their development. Since 7KC, provided by the diet or endogenously formed, is not or little efficiently metabolized, except in hepatic cells, its cellular accumulation can trigger numerous side effects including oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. To counteract 7KC-induced side effects, it is necessary to characterize the metabolic pathways activated by this oxysterol to identify potential targets for cytoprotection and geroprotection. Currently, several natural compounds (tocopherols, fatty acids, polyphenols, etc) or mixtures of compounds (oils) used in traditional medicine are able to inhibit the deleterious effects of 7KC. The different molecules identified could be valued in different ways (functional foods, recombinant molecules, theranostic) to prevent or treat diseases associated with 7KC.
Obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites are considered as deficient in cholesterol biosynthesis and scavenge cholesterol from their host cell in a parasite-specific manner. Compared to fast proliferating apicomplexan species producing low numbers of merozoites per host cell, (e. g. Toxoplasma gondii), the macromeront-forming protozoa Eimeria bovis is in extraordinary need for cholesterol for offspring production (≥ 170,000 merozoites I/macromeront). Interestingly, optimized in vitro E. bovis merozoite I production occurs under low foetal calf serum (FCS, 1.2%) supplementation. To analyze the impact of extensive E. bovis proliferation on host cellular sterol metabolism we here compared the sterol profiles of E. bovis-infected primary endothelial host cells grown under optimized (1.2% FCS) and non-optimized (10% FCS) cell culture conditions. Therefore, several sterols indicating endogenous de novo cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol conversion and sterol uptake (phytosterols) were analyzed via GC-MS-based approaches. Overall, significantly enhanced levels of phytosterols were detected in both FCS conditions indicating infection-triggered sterol uptake from extracellular sources as a major pathway of sterol acquisition. Interestingly, a simultaneous induction of endogenous cholesterol synthesis based on increased levels of distinct cholesterol precursors was only observed in case of optimized parasite proliferation indicating a parasite proliferation-dependent effect. Considering side-chain oxysterols, 25 hydroxycholesterol levels were selectively found increased in E. bovis-infected host cells, while 24 hydroxycholesterol and 27 hydroxycholesterol contents were not significantly altered by infection. Exogenous treatments with 25 hydroxycholesterol, 27 hydroxycholesterol, and 7 ketocholesterol revealed significant adverse effects on E. bovis intracellular development. Thus, the number and size of developing macromeronts and merozoite I production was significantly reduced indicating that these oxysterols bear direct or indirect antiparasitic properties. Overall, the current data indicate parasite-driven changes in the host cellular sterol profile reflecting the huge demand of E. bovis for cholesterol during macromeront formation and its versatility in the acquisition of cholesterol sources.
Macrophage aging is pathogenic in numerous diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in older adults. Although prior studies have explored the functional consequences of macrophage aging, less is known about its cellular basis or what defines the transition from physiologic aging to disease. Here, we show that despite their frequent self-renewal, macrophages from old mice exhibited numerous signs of aging, such as impaired oxidative respiration. Transcriptomic profiling of aged murine macrophages revealed dysregulation of diverse cellular pathways, especially in cholesterol homeostasis, that manifested in altered oxysterol signatures. Although the levels of numerous oxysterols in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma exhibited age-associated changes, plasma 24-hydroxycholesterol levels were specifically associated with AMD. These novel findings demonstrate that oxysterol levels can discriminate disease from physiologic aging. Furthermore, modulation of cholesterol homeostasis may be a novel strategy for treating age-associated diseases in which macrophage aging is pathogenic.
A growing bulk of evidence suggests that cholesterol oxidation products, known as oxysterols, are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of major chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Oxysterols are involved in various key steps of these complex processes, mainly thanks to their ability to act through up-regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell toxicity. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the effects induced by these compounds on cells, after their accumulation in the arterial wall, brain, and intestine. This evidence might help to develop innovative strategies to counteract the progression of these chronic inflammatory human diseases.
It is now established that cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) are involved in several events underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Of note, certain oxysterols cause neuron dysfunction and degeneration but, recently, some of them have been shown also to have neuroprotective effects. The present study, which aimed to understand the potential effects of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OH) against the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, stressed these latter effects. A beneficial effect of 24-OH was demonstrated in SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, and is due to its ability to modulate the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which contributes to preventing the neurotoxic accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Unlike 24-OH, 7-ketocholesterol (7-K) did not modulate the SIRT1-dependent neuroprotective pathway. To confirm the neuroprotective role of 24-OH, in vivo experiments were run on mice that express human tau without spontaneously developing tau pathology (hTau mice), by means of the intracerebroventricular injection of 24-OH. 24-OH, unlike 7-K, was found to completely prevent the hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by amyloid β monomers. These data highlight the importance of preventing the loss of 24-OH in the brain, and of maintaining high levels of the enzyme SIRT1, in order to counteract neurodegeneration.
Autophagy has been shown to be stimulated in advanced atherosclerotic plaques by metabolic stress, inflammation and oxidized lipids. The lack of published studies addressing the potential stimulation of pro-survival autophagy by oxysterols, a family of cholesterol oxidation products, has prompted our study. Thus, the goal of the current study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the autophagy induced by 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), that is one of the most abundant oxysterols in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, and to assess whether the pro-oxidant effect of the oxysterol is involved in the given response. Here we showed that 27-OH, in a low micromolar range, activates a pro-survival autophagic response in terms of increased LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and Beclin 1, that depends on the up-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways as a potential result of an intracellular reactive oxygen species increase provoked by the oxysterol in human promonocytic U937 cells. Moreover, 27-OH induced autophagy is dependent on the relation between nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response and p62. The data obtained highlight the involvement of cholesterol oxidation products in the pathogenesis of oxidative stress related chronic diseases like atherosclerosis. Therefore, deeply understanding the complex mechanism and generating synthetic or natural molecules targeting this survival mechanism might be very promising tools in the prevention of such diseases.
OSBP binds, extracts and transfers sterols and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P between liposomes, but the sequence of steps at the membrane surface leading to ligand removal is poorly characterized. In this study, we used dual polarization interferometry (DPI), a label-free surface analytical technique, to characterize the interaction of recombinant, purified OSBP as it flows over immobilized dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers containing PI(4)P, cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Kinetics of membrane interaction were analyzed for PI(4)P-binding and phosphorylation mutants of OSBP. Wild-type OSBP demonstrated a distinctive association with immobilized DOPC bilayers containing 1-8 mol% PI(4)P that was characterized by initial saturable binding followed by desorption, indicative of PI(4)P extraction. In support of this conclusion, an OSBP mutant with impaired binding and extraction of PI(4)P was stably absorbed to PI(4)P-containing membranes, while a pleckstrin homology domain mutant did not associate with PI(4)P-containing membranes. The inclusion of &gt;2 mol% cholesterol, but not 25-hydroxycholesterol, in membranes, enhanced the absorption of the wild-type OSBP. A phosphomimetic of OSBP with enhanced in vitro sterol binding activity displayed membrane interaction properties similar to wild-type. These real-time flow studies allow us to dissect the association of OSBP with PI(4)P into discrete components; initial recruitment to PI(4)P membranes by the PH domain, detection and extraction of PI(4)P, and desorption due to ligand depletion.
Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes metabolize approximately half of all drugs on the market. Since the endogenous compounds 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) are generated from cholesterol via CYP3A enzymes, we examined whether the plasma levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC reflect hepatic CYP3A4 activity by using a CYP3A-humanized mouse model, in which the function of endogenous Cyp3a was genetically replaced by human CYP3A. CYP3A-humanized mice have great advantages for evaluation of the relationship between hepatic CYP3A protein levels and plasma and hepatic levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC. Levels of CYP3A4 protein in the liver microsomes of CYP3A-humanized mice were increased by treatment with pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile, a CYP3A inducer. Hepatic and plasma levels of 4β-HC and 25-HC normalized by cholesterol were significantly correlated with hepatic CYP3A4 protein levels. In addition, in vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the formation of 4β-HC was strongly inhibited by a CYP3A inhibitor, while the inhibitory effect of the CYP3A inhibition on the formation of 25-HC was weak. These results suggested that CYP3A mainly contributed to the formation of 4β-HC in human liver microsomes, whereas other factors may be involved in the formation of 25-HC. In conclusion, the in vivo studies using CYP3A-humanized mice suggest that plasma 4β-HC and 25-HC levels reflect hepatic CYP3A4 activity. Furthermore, taking the results of in vitro studies using human liver microsomes into consideration, 4β-HC is a more reliable biomarker of hepatic CYP3A activity.
Dietary habits may strongly influence intestinal homeostasis. Oxysterols, the oxidized products of cholesterol present in cholesterol-containing foodstuffs, have been shown to exert pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects, altering intestinal epithelial layer and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Extra virgin olive oil polyphenols possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and concentrate in the intestinal lumen, where may help in preventing intestinal diseases. In the present study we evaluated the ability of an extra virgin olive oil phenolic extract to counteract the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory action of a representative mixture of dietary oxysterols in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) undergoing full differentiation into enterocyte-like cells. Oxysterols treatment significantly altered differentiated Caco-2 cells redox status, leading to oxidant species production and a decrease of GSH levels, after 1 h exposure, followed by an increase of cytokines production, IL-6 and IL-8, after 24 h. Oxysterol cell treatment also induced after 48 h an increase of NO release, due to the induction of iNOS. Pretreatment with the phenolic extract counteracted oxysterols effects, at least in part by modulating one of the main pathways activated in the cellular response to the action of oxysterols, the MAPK-NF-kB pathway. We demonstrated the ability of the phenolic extract to directly modulate p38 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB, following its inhibitor IkB phosphorylation. The phenolic extract also inhibited iNOS induction, keeping NO concentration at the control level. Our results suggest a protective effect at intestinal level of extra virgin olive oil polyphenols, able to prevent or limit redox unbalance and the onset and progression of chronic intestinal inflammation.
Rett syndrome (RS) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-Cpg-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Using a well-defined model for RS, the C57BL6/Mecp2tm1.1Bird mouse, we have previously found a moderate but persistently lower rate of cholesterol synthesis, measured in vivo, in the brains of Mecp2-/y mice, starting from about the third week after birth. There was no genotypic difference in the total cholesterol concentration throughout the brain at any age. This raised the question of whether the lower rate of cholesterol synthesis in the mutants was balanced by a fall in the rate at which cholesterol was converted via cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (Cyp46A1) to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), the principal route through which cholesterol is ordinarily removed from the brain. Here, we show that while there were no genotypic differences in the concentrations in plasma and liver of three cholesterol precursors (lanosterol, lathosterol, and desmosterol), two plant sterols (sitosterol and campesterol), and two oxysterols (27-hydroxycholesterol [27-OHC] and 24S-OHC), the brains of the Mecp2 -/y mice had significantly lower concentrations of all three cholesterol precursors, campesterol, and both oxysterols, with the level of 24S-OHC being ~20% less than in their Mecp2 +/y controls. Together, these data suggest that coordinated regulation of cholesterol synthesis and catabolism in the central nervous system is maintained in this model for RS. Furthermore, we speculate that the adaptive changes in these two pathways conceivably resulted from a shift in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier as implied by the significantly lower campesterol and 27-OHC concentrations in the brains of the Mecp2-/y mice.
This study was aimed at evaluating changes in CYP3A activity following and during pregnancy by analyzing metabolic markers for CYP3A activity, which can help avoid unnecessary drug exposure and invasive sampling.
Forty-eight pregnant women and 25 non-pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Plasma and urine samples were collected from the pregnant women during each trimester and from the non-pregnant women for evaluation of metabolic markers for CYP3A activity. Metabolic markers for CYP3A activity were measured using GC-MS.
An increased 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio, consistent with high CYP3A activity, was observed in pregnant women compared with that in non-pregnant women; however, no differences were observed among trimesters. No significant differences were observed in urinary markers.
We observed an increase in the activity of CYP3A following but not during pregnancy when measured using the 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio. In addition, based on our results, we suggest that the plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratio be used to measure CYP3A activity in pregnant women.
Oxysterols play important roles in development and diseases, but can be highly challenging to analyze. To ensure satisfactory measurements, oxysterols must typically be separated with chromatography prior to detection. Here, we will devote attention to the chromatography of oxysterols, focusing on gas chromatography and liquid chromatography. We will present the role of stationary phases, mobile phases, and dimensions and geometries of particles/columns. We discuss how these parameters may affect the chromatography, regarding factors such as speed and resolution. Finally, we present some less explored avenues for separation of oxysterols.
The seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor EBV-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, is expressed in particular in immune cells. Activated by its endogenous ligands, which are a group of oxysterols, it functions as a chemo-attractant receptor, mediating cell migration. In coordination with other receptors, EBI2 plays important roles in controlling the migration of immune cells during the course of a T-dependent Ab response in the spleen. In recent years, it has become clear that EBI2 also has other roles to play in the immune system. Thus, EBI2 seems to be involved in innate immune responses, such as those mediated by TLR signaling, and it has been implicated in regional immune responses, including immune responses in the CNS. In this review, we describe the functions of EBI2 in B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells during the course of a T-dependent Ab response in the spleen. Furthermore, we review the existing evidence supporting a role for EBI2 in local immune responses and in autoimmune diseases, with a special focus on immune responses in the CNS. Finally, we discuss which type of role EBI2 may play in autoimmune diseases, and we give our opinion about the paths of future research in EBI2.
Cholesterol and its oxygenated metabolites, such as oxysterols, are intensively investigated as potential players in the pathophysiology of brain disorder. Altered oxysterol levels have been described in patients with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome. Recent studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. The present study aimed at investigating the profile of oxysterols in plasma and their association with clinical parameters in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Thirty-six children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and thirty-eight healthy children, from Sfax (a southern area of Tunisia) matched for age and sex, were included in the study. The severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders was evaluated using the childhood autism rating scale. Standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were measured utilizing standard techniques. Oxysterol levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Standard lipid profile, serum glucose, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and orosomucoid levels were similar between the two studied populations. Compared to the control group, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders showed a significant higher plasma level of 24-hydroxycholesterol, while borderline significance was observed for 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholersterol. In patients, 24-hydroxycholesterol was inversely correlated with age. Multivariate analysis showed that high plasma levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol are independent risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorders. On the other hand, an analysis of the receiver's operating characteristics proved that the measured parameters recorded satisfactory levels of specificity and sensitivity. The present study provides evidence that Autism Spectrum Disorders are associated with altered levels in circulating oxysterols. The finding that 24-hydroxycholesterol is an independent risk factor for the disease and suggests the use of this oxysterol as a diagnostic tool in Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia are associated with ovarian failure and both have been related to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism promotes anovulation and ovarian cysts in women and reduces the size of follicles and the expression of aromatase in the ovary of rabbits. Considering that ovarian steroidogenesis and ovulation depend on lipid metabolism and signalling, the aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of hypothyroidism on the lipid content and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ in the ovary. Ovaries from female rabbits belonging to the control (n=7) and hypothyroid (n=7) groups were processed to measure total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycogen content, as well as to determine the presence of granules containing oxidized lipids (oxysterols and lipofuscin) and the relative expression of perilipin A (PLIN-A) and PPARδ. Hypothyroidism increased TC and glycogen content, but reduced TAG content in the ovary. This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of PLIN-A in total and cytosolic extracts, changes in the presence of granules containing oxidative lipids and low PPARδ expression. The results of the present study suggest that hypothyroidism modifies the content and signalling of lipids in the ovary, possibly affecting follicle maturation. These results could improve our understanding of the association between hypothyroidism and infertility in females.
Oxidized cholesterol derivatives are thought to exert atherogenic effect thus adversely affecting vascular endothelium. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol on experimentally induced hypercholesterolemia in rabbits, and the levels of homocysteine (HCY), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), and inflammatory parameters (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP).
The rabbits were divided into 3 groups, 8 animals each, and fed with basic fodder (C), basic fodder plus cholesterol (Ch) or basic fodder plus 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, and unoxidized cholesterol (ECh). Serum concentrations of studied parameters were determined at 45-day intervals. The study was continued for six months.
We demonstrated that adding 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol to basic fodder significantly affected lipid status of the experimental animals, increasing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, as well as HCY and ADMA levels, whilst leaving the PON-1 activity unaffected. Additionally, the ECh group presented with significantly higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP). In the Ch group, lower yet significant (as compared to the C group) changes of levels of studied parameters were observed.
Exposure of animals with experimentally induced hypercholesterolemia to 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol increases dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammatory response.
24-Hydroxycholesterol (24HC) is the main brain cholesterol metabolite, which level in the circulation is significantly changed under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we have studied the effect of 24HC on the inotropic responses to β-adrenoceptor (AR) stimulation.
Electrical stimulation-evoked contractions were recorded in isolated atria from mice. Fluorescent dyes, Fluo-4 and DAF-FM, were used for estimation of Ca2+ transient and NO production, respectively.
We revealed that 24HC in the submicromolar range attenuated β-AR-induced positive inotropy in isolated atria. This was accompanied by a decrease in Ca2+ transient and unchanged nitric oxide (NO) production. However, β1-AR-induced positive inotropy and enhancement of Ca2+ transient were increased by 24HC due to suppression of NO production. Only β2-AR-dependent inotropy and enhancement of Ca2+ transient were decreased by 24HC in a NO-independent manner. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) suppressed effect of 24HC on β2-AR-dependent contractility as well as on non-subtype specific β-AR activation. Moreover, 24HC counteracted positive inopropic action of PDE inhibitors, IBMX and rolipam. Thus, 24HC modulates the effects of β1- and β2-AR stimulation via different mechanisms linked with change in activity of NO synthase or PDE, respectively. Under conditions of non-selective activation of β-ARs, the depressant effect of 24HC related with β2-AR-dependent signaling dominates.
We suggest that 24HC could serve as a modulator of atrial β-AR signaling, contributing to regulation of contractility.
The mechanisms controlling CD4+ T cell switching from an effector to an anti-inflammatory (IL-10+) phenotype play an important role in the persistence of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we identify the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a key regulator of this process. Pathway analysis of cultured cytokine-producing human T cells reveals a significant association between IL-10 and cholesterol metabolism gene expression. Inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with atorvastatin or 25-hydroxycholesterol during switching from IFNγ+ to IL-10+ shows a specific block in immune resolution, defined as a significant decrease in IL-10 expression. Mechanistically, the master transcriptional regulator of IL10 in T cells, c-Maf, is significantly decreased by physiological levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Strikingly, progression to rheumatoid arthritis is associated with altered expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in synovial biopsies of predisposed individuals. Our data reveal a link between sterol metabolism and the regulation of the anti-inflammatory response in human CD4+ T cells.
Cholesterol is one of the most important chemical substances as a structural element in human cells, and it is very susceptible to oxidation reactions that form oxysterol. Oxysterols exhibit almost the exact structure as cholesterol and a cholesterol precursor (7-dehydrocholesterol) with an additional hydroxyl, epoxy or ketone moiety. The oxidation reaction is performed via an enzymatic or non-enzymatic mechanism. The wide array of enzymatic oxysterols encountered in the human body varies in origin and function. Oxysterols establish a concentration equilibrium in human body fluids. Disease may alter the equilibrium, and oxysterols may be used as a diagnostic tool. The current review presents the possibility of using non-enzymatic oxysterols and disturbances in enzymatic oxysterol equilibrium in the human body as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and/or monitoring of the progression of various diseases.
Circulating cholesterol levels have been linked to PD, but not directly to brain physiology.
To assess whether brain cholesterol metabolism is related to PD.
Sixty PD patients and 64 controls were recruited from an academic movement disorder clinic (2009-2012). Thirty-five PD patients and 33 controls returned approximately 36 months later. Fasting plasma (S)24-OH-cholesterol (brain-derived cholesterol metabolite) and 27-OH-cholesterol (peripheral cholesterol metabolite) were quantified. Odds ratios for PD were derived from logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. Relationships between the oxysterols and clinical measurements were explored using Spearman correlation coefficients.
Mean age of PD subjects was 63.8 ± 8.3 years and disease duration was 5.0 ± 5.4 years. Plasma (S)24-OH-cholesterol levels were inversely associated with the odds of having PD, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.97) for each 1-ng/mL increase (P = 0.004). Compared to the lowest tertile, the odds ratio was 0.34 (0.12-0.98) for the second tertile (P = 0.045) and 0.08 (0.02-0.31) for the highest tertile (P &lt; 0.001). Higher (S)24-OH-cholesterol levels also were correlated with better sense of smell (r = 0.35; P = 0.01). No significant associations were found between clinical measures and 27-OH-cholesterol, a peripheral cholesterol metabolite. Furthermore, (S)24-OH-cholesterol levels were stable over time, whereas 27-OH-cholesterol decreased with time in both cases and controls.
Results indicate that plasma (S)24-OH-cholesterol (possibly reflecting brain cholesterol metabolism) is inversely linked to PD, is relatively stable over time, and may serve as a new biomarker for PD. Further investigation is necessary to determine the mechanistic and clinical implications. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.
The membrane dipole potential, ψ d, is an electrical potential difference with a value typically in the range 150-350 mV (positive in the membrane interior) which is located in the lipid headgroup region of the membrane, between the linkage of the hydrocarbon chains to the phospholipid glycerol backbone and the adjacent aqueous solution. At its physiological level in animal plasma membranes (up to 50 mol%), cholesterol makes a significant contribution to ψ d of approximately 65 mV; the rest arising from other lipid components of the membrane, in particular phospholipids. Via its effect on ψ d, cholesterol may modulate the activity of membrane proteins. This could occur through preferential stabilization of protein conformational states. Based on its effect on ψ d, cholesterol would be expected to favour protein conformations associated with a small local hydrophobic membrane thickness. Via its membrane condensing effect, which also produces an increase in ψ d, cholesterol could further modulate interactions of polybasic cytoplasmic extensions of membrane proteins, in particular P-type ATPases, with anionic lipid headgroups on the membrane surface, thus leading to enhanced conformational stabilization effects and changes to ion pumping activity.
We recently communicated that the free-radical-mediated oxidation (autoxidation) of cholesterol yields a more complex mixture of hydroperoxide products than previously appreciated. In addition to the epimers of the major product, cholesterol 7-hydroperoxide, the epimers of each of the regioisomeric 4- and 6-hydroperoxides are formed as is the 5α-hydroperoxide in the presence of a good H-atom donor. Herein, we complete the story by reporting the products resulting from competing peroxyl radical addition to cholesterol, the stereoisomeric cholesterol-5,6-epoxides, which account for 12% of the oxidation products, as well as electrophilic dehydration products of the cholesterol hydroperoxides, 4-, 6-, and 7-ketocholesterol. Moreover, we interrogate how their distribution-and abundance relative to the H-atom abstraction products-changes in the presence of good H-atom donors, which has serious implications for how these oxysterols are used as biomarkers. The resolution and quantification of all autoxidation products by LC-MS/MS was greatly enabled by the synthesis of a new isotopically labeled cholesterol standard and corresponding selected autoxidation products. The autoxidation of cholesteryl acetate was also investigated as a model for the cholesterol esters which abound in vivo. Although esterification of cholesterol imparts measurable stereoelectronic effects, most importantly reflected in the fact that it autoxidizes at 4 times the rate of unesterified cholesterol, the product distribution is largely similar to that of cholesterol. Deuteration of the allylic positions in cholesterol suppresses autoxidation by H-atom transfer (HAT) in favor of addition, such that the epoxides are the major products. The corresponding kinetic isotope effect ( kH/ kD ∼ 20) indicates that tunneling underlies the preference for the HAT pathway.
The objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effect of alternate day fasting (ADF) and exercise on serum sterol signatures, which are surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption and biosynthesis.
We randomly assigned 112 overweight or obese participants to four groups: 1) ADF and exercise (E-ADF); 2) ADF; 3) exercise; and 4) control. We studied 31 completers in this exploratory analysis and measured their serum sterol signatures using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
After intervention, most serum sterol signatures that correspond to cholesterol metabolism were significantly different between groups (p &lt; 0.05 by analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). We found no differences in plant sterols, which are markers of cholesterol absorption. In the exercise group, desmosterol, cholesteryl esters, and oxysterols decreased significantly. Furthermore, only changes in physical activity levels negatively correlated with changes in the metabolic ratios of desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, which reflect cholesterol biosynthesis (r = -0.411; p = 0.030, and r = -0.540; p = 0.003, respectively).
These findings suggest that exercise with or without ADF improves cholesterol metabolism as measured by serum sterol signatures, and increased physical activity has a greater effect on cholesterol biosynthesis than weight reduction or calorie restriction.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a lipid-enveloped virion particle that causes infection to the liver, and as part of its life cycle, it disrupts the host lipid metabolic machinery, particularly the cholesterol synthesis pathway. The innate immune response generated by liver resident immune cells is responsible for successful viral eradication. Unfortunately, most patients fail to eliminate HCV and progress to chronic infection. Chronic infection is associated with hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation that triggers fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite that the current direct-acting antiviral agents have increased the cure rate of HCV infection, viral genotype and the host genetic background influence both the immune response and lipid metabolism. In this context, recent evidence has shown that cholesterol and its derivatives such as oxysterols might modulate and potentialize the hepatic innate immune response generated against HCV. The impairment of the HCV life cycle modulated by serum cholesterol could be relevant for the clinical management of HCV-infected patients before and after treatment. Alongside, cholesterol levels are modulated either by genetic variations in IL28B, ApoE, and LDLR or by dietary components. Indeed, some nutrients such as unsaturated fatty acids have demonstrated to be effective against HCV replication. Thus, cholesterol modifications may be considered as a new adjuvant strategy for HCV infection therapy by providing a biochemical tool that guides treatment decisions, an improved treatment response and favoring viral clearance. Herein, the mechanisms by which cholesterol contributes to the immune response against HCV infection and how genetic and environmental factors may affect this role are reviewed.
In contrast to cholesterol itself the side-chain oxidized metabolites 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OH) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH) are able to pass the blood-brain barrier and the blood-CSF barrier. Most 27OH in circulation is formed extracerebrally and according to catheterization experiments about 5 mg of it is taken up by the brain per 24 h. 24OH is almost exclusively produced in the brain and about 6 mg fluxes from the brain into the circulation per 24 h. In addition to these major fluxes a very minor fraction of these two oxysterols flux from the circulation into CSF. Isotope experiments have shown that almost all 27OH in CSF originates from the circulation and evidence has been presented that this is the case also with a substantial part of 24OH. The levels of both 24OH and 27OH in CSF are thus affected by the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier with higher levels when the barrier is defect. Both levels of 24OH and 27OH in CSF are increased in connection with neurodegeneration and in general the increase in 24OH levels is higher than the increase in 27OH levels. A number of observations in different type of patients including measurements of other biochemical markers support that the increase in levels of 24OH due to neurodegeneration is due to a release of this oxysterol or its precursor cholesterol from dying neuronal cells. In contrast the increase in levels of 27OH is likely to be a consequence of reduced metabolism due to loss of the neuronal enzyme CYP7B1. We discuss the driving forces behind the fluxes of oxysterols in the brain, the limitations in the flux across the barriers and the diagnostic potential for side-chain oxidized oxysterols in CSF.
Oxysterol analogs that modulate NMDA receptor function are candidates for therapeutic development to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the cellular actions of these compounds are still unclear. For instance, how these compounds are compartmentalized or trafficked in neurons is unknown. In this study, we utilized a chemical biology approach combining photolabeling and click chemistry. We introduce a biologically active oxysterol analog that contains: (1) a diazirine group, allowing for the permanent labeling of cellular targets, and (2) an alkyne group, allowing for subsequent in situ visualization using Cu2+ catalyzed cycloaddition of an azide-conjugated fluorophore. The physiological properties of this analog at NMDA receptors resemble those of other oxysterols, including occlusion with other oxysterol-like compounds. Fluorescent imaging reveals that the analog accumulates diffusely in the cytoplasm of neurons through an energy-independent mechanism. Overall, this work introduces a novel chemical biology approach to investigate oxysterol actions and introduces a tool useful for further cell biological and biochemical studies of oxysterols.
Cholesterol is an essential molecule for life. It is a component of the cell membrane, and it is a precursor molecule for bile acids, vitamin D and steroid hormones. Cholesterol is actively metabolized, but the impact of endogenous cholesterol metabolites on immune function, especially in the intestine, is poorly understood. In this review, I focus on oxysterols, hydroxylated forms of cholesterol, and their specialized functions in intestinal immunity. Oxysterols act through various intracellular and extracellular receptors and serve as key metabolic signals, coordinating immune activity and inflammation. Our recent work has identified an unexpected link between cholesterol metabolism, innate lymphoid cell function and intestinal homeostasis. We discovered that oxysterol sensing through the G protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183) directs the migration of innate lymphoid cells, which is essential for the formation of lymphoid tissue in the colon. Moreover, we found that the interaction of GPR183 with oxysterols regulates intestinal inflammation. I will discuss the therapeutic potential of oxysterols and future possibilities of treating inflammatory bowel disease through the modulation of cholesterol metabolism.
Four new oxysterols 1⁻4 along with previously known oxygenated sterols 5⁻14 were isolated from the sponge Inflatella sp., collected from the Sea of Okhotsk. Structures of 1⁻4 were elucidated by the detailed NMR spectroscopic and mass-spectrometric analyses as well as by comparison of the corresponding experimental data with those reported in literature. The influence of compounds 1⁻14 on the viability of neuronal Neuro2a cells treated by 6-hydroxydopamine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in these cells was investigated.
Throughout life, stress stimuli act upon the brain leading to morphological and functional changes in advanced age, when it is likely to develop neurodegenerative disorders. There is an increasing need to unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying aging, in a world where populations are getting older. Egr-1 (early growth response 1), a transcriptional factor involved in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation - with a role also in memory, cognition and synaptic plasticity, can be implicated in the molecular mechanism of the aging process. Moreover, Heme Oxygenase-1a (HO), a 32 kDa heat-shock protein that converts heme to iron, carbon monoxide and biliverdin, is a key enzyme with neuroprotective properties. Several in vitro and in vivo studies reported that HO-1 could regulate the metabolism of oxysterols, oxidation products of cholesterol that include markers of oxidative stress. Recently, a link between Egr-1 and HO-1 has been demonstrated in mouse lung cells exposed to cigarette smoke. In view of these data, we wanted to investigate whether Egr-1 can be implicated also in the oxysterol metabolism during brain aging. Our results show that Egr-1 expression is differently expressed in the cortex and hippocampus of old mice, as well as the oxysterol profile between these two brain areas. In particular, we show that the cortex experiences in an age-dependent fashion increasing levels of the Egr-1 protein, and that these correlate with the level of HO-1 expression and oxysterol abundance. Such a situation was not observed in the hippocampus. These results are further strenghtened by our observations made with Egr-1 KO mice, confirming our hypothesis concerning the influence of Egr-1 on oxysterol production and accumulation via regulation of the expression of HO-1 in the cortex, but not the hippocampus, of old mice. It is important to notice that most of the oxysterols involved in this process are those usually stimulated by oxidative stress, which would then represent the triggering factor for this mechanism.
Endochondral ossification is the process by which long bones are formed; the process of long bone formation is regulated by numerous factors such as transcription factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules. Human hormone Nuclear receptors (hHNR) are a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that are activated by steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, and various lipid-soluble signals, including retinoic acid, oxysterols, and thyroid hormone. Whole genome microarray data from our previous study revealed that most hHNR's are up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation in hMSCS. NR2F1 was among the highest expressed hHNR during osteogenesis, NR2F1 belongs to the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily. NR2F1 is designated as an orphan nuclear receptor because its ligands are unknown. NR2F1 plays a wide range of roles, including cell differentiation, cancer progression, and central and peripheral neurogenesis. Identifying signaling networks involved in osteoblast differentiation is important in orchestrating new therapeutic and clinical applications in bone biology. This study aimed to identify alterations in signaling networks mediated by NR2F1 in osteoblast differentiation. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of NR2F1 leads to impairment in the differentiation of hBMSC-TERT to osteoblast; gene-expression results confirmed the down-regulation of osteoblast markers such as RUNX2, ALPL, OSC, and BSP. Global whole gene expression analysis revealed that most down-regulated genes were associated with osteoblast differentiation (DDIT3, BMP2). Pathway analysis revealed prominent signaling pathways that were down-regulated, including the TGFβ pathway and MAPK pathway. Functional studies on NR2F1 transfected cells, during osteoblast differentiation in combination with TGFβ1 and BMP-2, showed that TGFβ1 does not recover osteoblast differentiation, whereas BMP-2 rescues osteoblast differentiation in NR2F1 siRNA transfected cells. Thus, our results showed that BMP-2 could intervene in NR2F1 down-regulated signaling pathways to recover osteoblast differentiation.
Metabolomics has become a powerful tool in chemical biology. Profiling the human sterolome has resulted in the discovery of noncanonical sterols, including oxysterols and meiosis-activating sterols. They are important to immune responses and development, and have been reviewed extensively. The triterpenoid metabolite fusidic acid has developed clinical relevance, and many steroidal metabolites from microbial sources possess varying bioactivities. Beyond the prospect of pharmacognostical agents, the profiling of minor metabolites can provide insight into an organism's biosynthesis and phylogeny, as well as inform drug discovery about infectious diseases. This review aims to highlight recent discoveries from detailed sterolomic profiling in microorganisms and their phylogenic and pharmacological implications.
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive human disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductase (DHCR7), resulting in abnormal accumulation of 7DHC and reduced levels of cholesterol in bodily tissues and fluids. A rat model of the disease has been created by treating normal rats with the DHCR7 inhibitor, AY9944, which causes progressive, irreversible retinal degeneration. Herein, we review the features of this disease model and the evidence linking 7DHC-derived oxysterols to the pathobiology of the disease, with particular emphasis on the associated retinal degeneration. A recent study has shown that treating the rat model with cholesterol plus suitable antioxidants completely prevents the retinal degeneration. These findings are discussed with regard to their translational implications for developing an improved therapeutic intervention for SLOS over the current standard of care.
Cholesterol oxidation product 4β‑hydroxycholesterol (4β‑OHC) may possibly be used as an endogenous biomarker of CYP3A enzyme activity and as CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of approximately 50% of the drugs in clinical use, the monitoring of CYP3A activity by 4β‑OHC plasma or serum levels, may be of clinical significance. The plasma and serum concentrations of 4α‑hydroxycholesterol (4α‑OHC), an isomer of 4β‑OHC, increase during uncontrolled storage conditions and therefore serve as an indicator of proper handling of samples. A sensitive and simple high-throughput method for the simultaneous quantification of both 4α‑OHC and 4β‑OHC in human plasma and serum was developed utilizing ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/ESI-HR-MS). The chromatographic analysis was carried out on a Waters HSS T3 C18 reversed phase column with a mobile phase composed of 0,1% formic acid with 200 mg/l sodium acetate, and methanol. 4β‑OHC and 4α‑OHC and also internal standard d7‑4β‑OHC were monitored using HR-MS as sodium adducts, which could not be used as a precursor ions in conventional tandem mass spectrometry methods due to their extensive stability in collision for MS/MS. The use of HR-MS detection enabled avoiding laborious sample derivatization, which is required with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer-based methods to achieve adequate analytical sensitivity for 4β‑OHC, as the underivatized molecule is otherwise poorly ionized to other molecular ions than sodium adduct. Chromatographic separation of 4α‑OHC and 4β‑OHC was obtained and confirmed with standard samples prepared in blank surrogate matrix. The lower limits of quantitation in the assay were 0.5 ng/ml for 4β‑OHC, and 2 ng/ml for 4α‑OHC. Endogenous levels of 4β‑OHC can vary between 10 and 100 ng/ml depending on the possible induction or inhibition of CYP3A4, whereas the levels of 4α‑OHC can vary between 5 and 100 ng/ml, depending on the storage conditions of the samples. Thus, the sensitivity of the assay developed allows for the simultaneous measurement of endogenous levels of 4α‑OHC and 4β‑OHC cost-effectively and with high throughput. The method was successfully used for the determination of 4β‑OHC and 4α‑OHC concentrations in clinical plasma and serum samples collected before and after treatment with a known CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. The endogenous levels in clinical human samples before treatment varied between 13.4 and 31.9 ng/ml for 4β‑OHC, and between 3.53 and 5.65 ng/ml for 4α‑OHC, and a three-fold increase in 4β‑OHC plasma levels was observed after the rifampicin treatment, while 4α‑OHC levels remained unaffected.
Primary cilia are required for Smoothened to transduce vertebrate Hedgehog signals, but how Smoothened accumulates in cilia and is activated is incompletely understood. Here, we identify cilia-associated oxysterols that promote Smoothened accumulation in cilia and activate the Hedgehog pathway. Our data reveal that cilia-associated oxysterols bind to two distinct Smoothened domains to modulate Smoothened accumulation in cilia and tune the intensity of Hedgehog pathway activation. We find that the oxysterol synthase HSD11β2 participates in the production of Smoothened-activating oxysterols and promotes Hedgehog pathway activity. Inhibiting oxysterol biosynthesis impedes oncogenic Hedgehog pathway activation and attenuates the growth of Hedgehog pathway-associated medulloblastoma, suggesting that targeted inhibition of Smoothened-activating oxysterol production may be therapeutically useful for patients with Hedgehog-associated cancers.
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a component of lipid-transporting particles and a recognition ligand for receptors, which bind these particles. The APOE isoform ε2 is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration; nevertheless, APOE absence in humans and mice does not significantly affect the retina. We found that retinal cholesterol biosynthesis and the levels of retinal cholesterol were increased in Apoe-/- mice, whereas cholesterol elimination by metabolism was decreased. No focal cholesterol deposits were observed in the Apoe-/- retina. Retinal proteomics identified the most abundant cholesterol-related proteins in WT mice and revealed that, of these cholesterol-related proteins, only APOA4 had increased expression in the Apoe-/- retina. In addition, there were changes in retinal abundance of proteins involved in proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses, cellular cytoskeleton maintenance, vesicular traffic, and retinal iron homeostasis. The data obtained indicate that when APOE is absent, particles containing APOA1, APOA4, and APOJ still transport cholesterol in the intraretinal space, but these particles are not taken up by retinal cells. Therefore, cholesterol biosynthesis inside retinal cells increase, whereas metabolism to oxysterols decreases to prevent cells from cholesterol depletion. These and other compensatory changes underlie only a minor retinal phenotype in Apoe-/- mice.
Cholesterol and cholesterol-derived oxysterols are critical for embryonic development, synapse formation and function, and myelination, among other biological functions. Indeed, alterations in levels of cholesterol, sterol precursors, and oxysterols result in a variety of developmental disorders, emphasizing the importance of cholesterol homeostasis. The ability of xenobiotics to reproduce similar phenotypes by altering cholesterol homeostasis has increasingly become of interest. Therefore, the ability to quantitatively assess alterations in cholesterol homeostasis resulting from exposure to xenobiotics is of value. This unit describes methods for the quantitative assessment of altered post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis and subsequent oxysterol formation in various sample types using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Understanding alterations in cholesterol homeostasis resulting from xenobiotic exposure can provide key insight into the toxicant's mechanism of action and resulting phenotype. © 2018 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
Oxysterols are 27-carbon oxidation products of cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterols possess several biological actions, including the promotion of cell death. Here, we examined the ability of several oxysterols to induce short-term death in cancerous (human breast cancer and mouse skin melanoma cells) and non-cancerous (human endothelial cells and lung fibroblasts) cell lines. We determined cell viability, Ki67 expression, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis after 24-h incubations with oxysterols. We found that different oxysterols had different effects on the studied parameters. Moreover, the effects depended on cell type and oxysterol concentration. Three cytotoxic oxysterols (7-ketocholesterol, cholestane-3β-5α-6β-triol, and 5α-cholestane-3β,6β-diol) inhibited the S phase and stimulated the G0/G1 or G2/M phases. These oxysterols promoted apoptosis, determined with Annexin V and propidium iodide assays. These results showed that different oxysterols have cytotoxic effects depending on the cell line. The findings suggest a potential pharmacological utility of cytotoxic oxysterols.
In the present study, we discuss the recent developments in oxysterol research. Exciting results have been reported relating to the involvement of oxysterols in the fields of neurodegenerative disease, especially in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease; in signalling and development, in particular, in relation to Hedgehog signalling; and in cancer, with a special focus on (25R)26-hydroxycholesterol. Methods for the measurement of oxysterols, essential for understanding their mechanism of action in vivo, and valuable for diagnosing rare diseases of cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism are briefly considered.
Integrins are components of cell-matrix adhesions, and function as scaffolds for various signal transduction pathways. So far no lipid ligand for integrin has been reported. Here we show that a lipid, oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), directly binds to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins to activate integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Treatment of macrophages and epithelial cells with 25HC results in an increase in activated αvβ3 integrin in podosome and focal adhesion matrix adhesion sites. Moreover, activation of pattern recognition receptor on macrophages induces secretion of 25HC, triggering integrin signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. Thus, the lipid molecule 25HC is a physiologically relevant activator of integrins and is involved in positively regulating proinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that extracellular 25HC links innate immune inflammatory response with integrin signaling.
So far, the investigation in cancer cell lines of the modulation of cancer growth and progression by oxysterols, in particular 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), has yielded controversial results. The primary aim of this study was the quantitative evaluation of possible changes in 27HC levels during the different steps of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression in humans. A consistent increase in this oxysterol in CRC mass compared to the tumor-adjacent tissue was indeed observed, but only in advanced stages of progression (TNM stage III), a phase in which cancer has spread to nearby sites. To investigate possible pro-tumor properties of 27HC, its effects were studied in vitro in differentiated CaCo-2 cells. Relatively high concentrations of this oxysterol markedly increased the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins 6 and 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. The up-regulation of all these molecules, which are potentially able to favor cancer progression, appeared to be dependent upon a net stimulation of Akt signaling exerted by supra-physiological amounts of 27HC.
Elimination of brain cholesterol occurs in the form of 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HCh) that may modulate physiological processes outside the brain. Here, using microelectrode recording of postsynaptic responses (end-plate potentials, EPPs) and fluorescent marker (FM1-43) for endo-exocytosis we studied the effects of prolonged application of 24S-HCh (2.5 h, 0.4 μM) on the neurotransmission in the mice diaphragm. 24S-HCh enhanced the depression of EPP amplitude (indicator of neurotransmitter release) and suppressed the FM1-43 dye unloading from nerve terminals (indicator of exocytosis) during electrical nerve stimulation at 20 Hz, without affecting miniature EPP amplitude and frequency. Comparison of the rates of neurotransmitter and FM1-43 releases suggested an increase in time required for the synaptic vesicle reuse. Additionally, 24S-HCh potentiated an increase in DAF-FM fluorescence (a NO-sensitive marker) in response to 20 Hz stimulation. All effects of 24S-HCh were completely prevented by liver X receptor antagonist. Either inhibitors of NO synthases (TRIM, cavtratin) or protein synthesis blocker counteracted the 24S-HCh-mediated enhancement in DAF-FM fluorescence, while inhibition of NO production with l-NAME or cavtratin and extracellular NO chelation suppressed the effect of 24S-HCh on FM1-43 dye loss during 20 Hz activity. Pretreatment for 5 days with inhibitor of 24S-HCh synthesis (voriconazole) had opposite effects on the FM1-43 unloading and NO synthesis. These data suggest that prolonged exposure to 24S-HCh attenuates recruitment of synaptic vesicle to exocytosis during 20 Hz stimulation acting via liver Х receptor/NO-dependent signaling.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and it is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. However, the complete pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown. High level of serum cholesterol has been found to positively correlate with an increased risk of dementia and some studies have reported a decreased prevalence of AD in patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Years of research have shown a strong correlation between blood hypercholesterolemia and AD, however cholesterol is not able to cross the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) into the brain. Cholesterol lowering therapies have shown mixed results in cognitive performance in AD patients, raising questions of whether brain cholesterol metabolism in the brain should be studied separately from peripheral cholesterol metabolism and what their relationship is. Unlike cholesterol, oxidized cholesterol metabolites known as oxysterols are able to cross the BBB from the circulation into the brain and vice-versa. The main oxysterols present in the circulation are 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol. These oxysterols and their catalysing enzymes have been found to be altered in AD brains and there is evidence indicating their influence in the progression of the disease. This review gives a broad perspective on the relationship between hypercholesterolemia and AD, cholesterol lowering therapies for AD patients and the role of oxysterols in pathological and non-pathological conditions. Also, we propose cholesterol metabolites as valuable targets for prevention and alternative AD treatments.
Oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs) comprise a family of sterol-binding proteins. In this study, we focused on AoOSBP1, one of the five OSBP proteins identified from the industrial fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The temporal expression pattern analysis showed that the expression of AoOSBP1, in both gene and protein levels, was stably expressed throughout the developmental stages, while was upregulated during the accelerated growth stage. The immunofluorescence observation revealed that AoOSBP1 protein was mainly distributed in the conidiophore, indicating its underlying role in spore formation. The ligand-binding domain of AoOSBP1, namely OSBP-related domain (ORD), was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The binding assay carried out using microscale thermophoresis showed that the recombinant AoORD protein exhibited binding affinity for ergosterol, and exhibited much higher affinity to oxysterols (25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol) and phytosterols (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol). By contrast, MBP tag as the negative control showed no binding affinity for sterols. The present work demonstrates that AoORD domain in AoOSBP1 is capable of binding sterols, plays an underlying role in sterols transportation, and may participate in spore formation.
A present review is devoted to the analysis of literature data and results of own research. Skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction is specialized to trigger the striated muscle fiber contraction in response to motor neuron activity. The safety factor at the neuromuscular junction strongly depends on a variety of pre- and postsynaptic factors. The review focuses on the crucial role of membrane cholesterol to maintain a high efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. Cholesterol metabolism in the neuromuscular junction, its role in the synaptic vesicle cycle and neurotransmitter release, endplate electrogenesis, as well as contribution of cholesterol to the synaptogenesis, synaptic integrity, and motor disorders are discussed.
Gallstone disease is caused by multiple pathogenic factors and is common worldwide. Most studies have focused on the significance of the biliary microbiome in gallstone pathogenesis. Areas covered: In this study, the epidemiology of gallstone diseases and the existence, composition, origin, and mechanisms of the biliary microbiota were reviewed. Mechanisms involved in promoting the formation of different types of gallstones were also emphasized. The antibiotic susceptibility of the biliary microbiota is briefly discussed because it may guide clinical strategies. Expert commentary: The biliary microbiome facilitates the formation of brown pigment stones. Although glycoprotein (mucin) may be pivotal for many promoting substances to coagulate and integrate relevant components, new mechanisms involving prostaglandins, oxysterols, oxygen free radicals, and lipopolysaccharides have been discovered. Furthermore, specific bacterial species such as Helicobacter and Salmonella are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. Recently, metabolomics of the biliary microbiome has been used to determine the detailed mechanisms that promote gallstone formation. Previously, the bacterial effects involved in the pathogenesis of brown pigment stones have not been analyzed in detail. Whether the administration of antibiotics is related to prophylaxis for gallstone formation and gallstone-associated infections remains unclear.
Glaucoma is one of the most frequent causes of visual impairment worldwide and involves selective damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) resulting in degeneration of neural pathways connecting retina to visual cortex. It is of interest that similarities in pathological changes have been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of progressive memory loss and dementia in older people. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau is thought to contribute to apoptotic neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease, and similar changes have been linked to apoptotic RGC death in glaucoma. Both glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease also suffer from a lack of effective treatments prompting a search for novel therapeutic interventions. Neurosteroids (NSs) (including oxysterols) are endogenous molecules synthesized in the nervous system from cholesterol that can modulate glutamate and GABA receptors, the primary mediators of fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, respectively. Because changes in the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and glaucoma, NSs are possible therapeutic targets for these disorders. In this review, we present recent evidence supporting pathological links between Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma, and focus on the possible role of NSs in these diseases and how NSs might be developed for therapeutic purposes.
Our objective was to investigate the effect of cholesterol [hypercholesterolemia and 7-ketocholesterol (7K)] on endoglin (Eng) expression and regulation with respect to endothelial or vascular dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. In vivo experiments were performed in 2-mo-old atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient/LDL receptor-deficient (ApoE-/-/LDLR-/-) female mice and their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates. In in vitro experiments, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated with 7K. ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice developed hypercholesterolemia accompanied by increased circulating levels of P-selectin and Eng and a disruption of NO metabolism. Functional analysis of the aorta demonstrated impaired vascular reactivity, and Western blot analysis revealed down-regulation of membrane Eng/Smad2/3/eNOS signaling in ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice. 7K increased Eng expression via Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), liver X nuclear receptor, and NF-κB in HAECs. 7K-induced Eng expression was prevented by the treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; 8-{[5-chloro-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) pyridine-4-carbonyl] amino}-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4, 5-dihydrobenzo[g]indazole-3-carboxamide; or by KLF6 silencing. 7K induced increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytic human leukemia promonocytic cell line cells and was prevented by Eng silencing. We concluded that hypercholesterolemia altered Eng expression and signaling, followed by endothelial or vascular dysfunction before formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice. By contrast, 7K increased Eng expression and induced inflammation in HAECs, which was followed by an increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytes via endothelium, which was prevented by Eng inhibition. Thus, we propose a relevant role for Eng in endothelial or vascular dysfunction or inflammation when exposed to cholesterol.-Vicen, M., Vitverova, B., Havelek, R., Blazickova, K., Machacek, M., Rathouska, J., Najmanová, I., Dolezelova, E., Prasnicka, A., Sternak, M., Bernabeu, C., Nachtigal, P. Regulation and role of endoglin in cholesterol-induced endothelial and vascular dysfunction in vivo and in vitro.
The term hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) embraces a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. There currently exist no specific therapies for HSP, and treatment is exclusively symptomatic, aimed at reducing muscle spasticity, and improving strength and gait. The authors set out to perform a comprehensive systematic review of the available scientific literature on the treatment of HSP, applying Cochrane Collaboration methods. The Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were searched to find relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) and open-label interventional studies, prospective, and retrospective observational studies of supplements, medications, and physical therapy, as well as case reports and case series. Two authors independently analyzed 27 articles selected on the basis of a series of inclusion criteria. Applying a best-evidence synthesis approach, they evaluated these articles for methodological quality. A standardized scoring system was used to obtain interrater assessments. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The 27 articles focused on pharmacological treatment (n = 17 articles), physical therapy (n = 5), surgical treatment (n = 5). The drugs used in the 17 articles on pharmacological therapy were: gabapentin, progabide, dalfampridine, botulinum toxin, L-Dopa, cholesterol-lowering drugs, betaine, and folinic acid. Gabapentin, progabide, dalfampridine, and botulinum toxin were used as antispastic agents; the study evaluating gabapentin efficacy was well-designed, but failed to demonstrate any significant improvement. L-Dopa, cholesterol-lowering drugs, betaine, and folinic acid were only used in specific HSP subtypes. Two of the three studies evaluating cholesterol-lowering drugs (in SPG5 patients) were well-designed and showed a significant reduction of specific serum biomarkers (oxysterols), but clinical outcomes were not evaluated. The articles focusing on physical treatment and surgical therapy were found to be of low/medium quality and, accordingly, failed to clarify the role of these approaches in HSP. Despite recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of HSP and the possibility, in several centers, of obtaining more precise and rapid molecular diagnoses, there is still no adequate evidence base for recommending the various published therapies. Well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of both symptomatic and pathogenetic treatments.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) constitute a family of intracellular lipid-binding/transport proteins (LTPs) in eukaryotes. They typically have a modular structure comprising a lipid-binding domain and membrane targeting determinants, being thus suited for function at membrane contact sites. Among the mammalian ORPs, ORP2/OSBPL2 is the only member that only exists as a 'short' variant lacking a membrane-targeting pleckstrin homology domain. ORP2 is expressed ubiquitously and has been assigned a multitude of functions. Its OSBP-related domain binds cholesterol, oxysterols, and phosphoinositides, and its overexpression enhances cellular cholesterol efflux. Consistently, the latest observations suggest a function of ORP2 in cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane (PM) in exchange for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2), with significant impacts on the concentrations of PM cholesterol and PI4,5P2. On the other hand, ORP2 localizes at the surface of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) and at endoplasmic-reticulum-LD contact sites, and its depletion modifies cellular triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Study in an adrenocortical cell line further suggested a function of ORP2 in the synthesis of steroid hormones. Our recent knock-out of ORP2 in human hepatoma cells revealed its function in hepatocellular PI3K/Akt signaling, glucose and triglyceride metabolism, as well as in actin cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. ORP2 was shown to interact physically with F-actin regulators such as DIAPH1, ARHGAP12, SEPT9 and MLC12, as well as with IQGAP1 and the Cdc37-Hsp90 chaperone complex controlling the activity of Akt. Interestingly, mutations in OSBPL2 encoding ORP2 are associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss, and the protein was found to localize in cochlear hair cell stereocilia. The functions assigned to ORP2 suggest that this protein, in concert with other LTPs, controls the subcellular distribution of cholesterol in various cell types and steroid hormone synthesis in adrenocortical cells. However, it also impacts cellular TG and carbohydrate metabolism and F-actin-dependent functions, revealing a bewildering spectrum of activities.
Under pathological conditions, cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) appear in enhanced concentration in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which leads to cytotoxic effect, especially in central nervous system. However, the mode of action of oxysterols on the membrane level has not been fully resolved. In this paper we have investigated the interaction between 7α- hydroxycholesterol, 7α-OH (one of the most abundant oxysterol in human body) and two major membrane lipids: sphingomyelin, SM (basic component of lipid rafts and nerve membrane) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC (main phospholipid of mammalian cell membranes). 7α-OH/SM mixtures may mimic pathologically changed lipid raft (ordered phase, LO) while the SM/POPC system can model its surrounding (liquid-disordered phase, Lα). For our study, the Langmuir monolayer technique (based on registration of the surface pressure/area, π/A isotherms), complemented with surface visualization technique (Brewster angle microscopy, BAM) and theoretical calculations, have been employed. The observed affinity of 7α-OH to SM, which appears to be stronger than in cholesterol/SM system, indicates that cholesterol might be partially replaced in lipid rafts by its oxidized derivative. Its incorporation significantly increases rigidity of the system in relation to normal (cholesterol-containing) raft, which can disturb its proper functioning. On the other hand, the poor effect of this oxysterol on the raft's environment was observed.
The aim of this paper was to more completely study the mitochondrial CYP27A1 initiated acidic pathway of cholesterol metabolism. The mitochondrial CYP27A1 initiated pathway of cholesterol metabolism (acidic pathway) is known to synthesize two well-described vital regulators of cholesterol/lipid homeostasis, (25R)-26-hydroxycholesterol (26HC) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC). Both 26HC and 25HC have been shown to be subsequently 7α-hydroxylated by Cyp7b1; reducing their regulatory abilities and furthering their metabolism to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Cholesterol delivery into the inner mitochondria membrane, where CYP27A1 is located, is considered the pathway's only rate-limiting step. To further explore the pathway, we increased cholesterol transport into mitochondrial CYP27A1 by selectively increased expression of the gene encoding the steroidogenic acute transport protein (StarD1). StarD1 overexpression led to an unanticipated marked down-regulation of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7b1), a marked increase in 26HC, and the formation of a third vital regulatory oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), in B6/129 mice livers. To explore the further metabolism of 24HC, as well as, 25HC and 26HC, characterizations of oxysterols and bile acids using three murine models (StarD1 overexpression, Cyp7b1-/-, Cyp27a1-/-) and human Hep G2 cells were conducted. This report describes the discovery of a new mitochondrial-initiated pathway of oxysterol/bile acid biosynthesis. Just as importantly, it provides evidence for CYP7B1 as a key regulator of three vital intracellular regulatory oxysterol levels.
Lansoprazole is a potent anti-gastric ulcer drug that inhibits gastric proton pump activity. We identified a novel function for lansoprazole, as an inducer of anti-oxidative stress responses in the liver. Gastric administration of lansoprazole (10-100 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats produced a dose-dependent increase in hepatic mRNA levels of nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2, -like 2 (Nrf2), a redox-sensitive transcription factor, at 3 h and Nrf2 immunoreactivity (IR) in whole hepatic lysates at 6 h. Conversely, the levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1), which sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm under un-stimulated conditions, were unchanged. Translocation of Nrf2 into the nuclei of hepatocytes was observed using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Expression of mRNAs for Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and phase II enzymes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD (P) H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (Nqo1), glutathione S-transferase A2 (Gsta2), UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A6 (Ugt1a6), were dose-dependently up-regulated at 3 h. Furthermore, the levels of HO-1 IR were dose-dependently increased in hepatocytes at 6 h. Subcutaneous administration of lansoprazole (30 mg/kg/day) for 7 successive days resulted in up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 IR in hepatocytes and up-regulation of HO-1 IR in the liver. Pretreatment with lansoprazole attenuated thioacetamide (500 mg/kg)-induced acute hepatic damage via both HO-1-dependent and -independent pathways. Up-stream networks related to Nrf2 expression were investigated using microarray analysis, followed by data mining with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Up-regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1) pathway was associated with up-regulation of Nrf2 mRNA. In conclusion, lansoprazole might have an alternative indication in the prevention and treatment of oxidative hepatic damage through the induction of both phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing systems, i.e. the AhR/Cyp1a1/Nrf2 pathway in hepatocytes. 
We sought to elucidate the effect of an ascorbic acid (AA) deficiency on gene expression, because the water soluble antioxidant AA is an important bioactive substance in vivo.
We performed microarray analyses of the transcriptome in the liver from senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30)/gluconolactonase (GNL) knockout (KO) mice, which are unable to synthesize AA in vivo.
Our microarray analysis revealed that the AA deficiency increased gene expression related to the oxidation-reduction process, i.e., the nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 (Nrf2) gene, which is a reactive oxygen species-sensitive transcriptional factor. Moreover, this AA deficiency increased the expression of genes for lipid metabolism including the cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp7a1), which is a late-limiting enzyme of the primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Although an AA deficiency increased the Cyp7a1 protein level, bile acid levels in the liver and gallbladder decreased. Since Cyp7a1 has a heme iron at the active site, AA must function as a reductant of the iron required for the continuous activation of Cyp7a1.
This experimental evidence strongly supports a role for AA in the physiologic oxidation-reduction process and lipid metabolism including bile acid biosynthesis.
Although many effects of AA supplementation have been reported, no microarray analysis of AA deficiency in vivo is available. Results from using this unique model of AA deficiency, the SMP30/GNL-KO mouse, now provide new information about formerly unknown AA functions that will implement further study of AA in vivo.
In beef cattle, the ability to conceive has been associated positively with size of the preovulatory follicle (POF). Proestrus estradiol and subsequent progesterone concentrations can regulate the endometrium to affect receptivity and fertility. The aim of the present study was to verify the effect of the size of the POF on luteal and endometrial gene expression during subsequent early diestrus in beef cattle. Eighty-three multiparous, nonlactating, presynchronized Nelore cows received a progesterone-releasing device and estradiol benzoate on Day-10 (D-10). Animals received cloprostenol (large follicle-large CL group; LF-LCL; N = 42) or not (small follicle-small CL group; SF-SCL; N = 41) on D-10. Progesterone devices were withdrawn and cloprostenol administered 42 to 60 hours (LF-LCL) or 30 to 36 hours (SF-SCL) before GnRH treatment (D0). Tissues were collected at slaughter on D7. The LF-LCL group had larger (P &lt; 0.0001) POF (13.24 ± 0.33 mm vs. 10.76 ± 0.29 mm), greater (P &lt; 0.0007) estradiol concentrations on D0 (2.94 ± 0.28 pg/mL vs. 1.27 ± 0.20 pg/mL), and greater (P &lt; 0.01) progesterone concentrations on D7 (3.71 ± 0.25 ng/mL vs. 2.62 ± 0.26 ng/mL) compared with the SF-SCL group. Luteal gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A, kinase insert domain receptor, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1, and hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 7 was similar between groups. Endometrial gene expression of oxytocin receptor and peptidase inhibitor 3, skin-derived was reduced, and estrogen receptor alpha 2, aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C4, and lipoprotein lipase expression was increased in LF-LCL versus SF-SCL. Results support the hypothesis that the size of the POF alters the periovulatory endocrine milieu (i.e., proestrus estradiol and diestrus progesterone concentrations) and acts on the uterus to alter endometrial gene expression. It is proposed that the uterine environment and receptivity might also be modulated. Additionally, it is suggested that increased progesterone secretion of cows ovulating larger follicles is likely due to increased CL size rather than increased luteal expression of steroidogenic genes. 
Vitamin D deficiency is linked to a range of muscle disorders including myalgia, muscle weakness, and falls. Humans with severe vitamin D deficiency and mice with transgenic vitamin D receptor (VDR) ablation have muscle fiber atrophy. However, molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D influences muscle function and fiber size remain unclear. A central question is whether VDR is expressed in skeletal muscle and is able to regulate transcription at this site. To address this, we examined key molecular and morphologic changes in C2C12 cells treated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D). As well as stimulating VDR expression, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)(2)D dose-dependently increased expression of the classic vitamin D target cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP24A1), demonstrating the presence of an autoregulatory vitamin D-endocrine system in these cells. Luciferase reporter studies demonstrated that cytochrome P450, family 27, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP27B1) was functional in these cells. Both 25OHD and 1,25(OH)(2)D altered C2C12 proliferation and differentiation. These effects were related to the increased expression of genes involved in G(0)/G(1) arrest (retinoblastoma protein [Rb], 1.3-fold; ATM, 1.5-fold, both P &lt; .05), downregulation of mRNAs involved in G(1)/S transition, including myc and cyclin-D1 (0.7- and 0.8-fold, both P &lt; .05) and reduced phosphorylation of Rb protein (0.3-fold, P &lt; .005). After serum depletion, 1,25(OH)(2)D (100nM) suppressed myotube formation with decreased mRNAs for key myogenic regulatory factors (myogenin, 0.5-fold; myf5, 0.4-fold, P &lt; .005) but led to a 1.8-fold increase in cross-sectional size of individual myotubes associated with markedly decreased myostatin expression (0.2-fold, P &lt; .005). These data show that vitamin D signaling alters gene expression in C2C12 cells, with effects on proliferation, differentiation, and myotube size.
New drugs are continuously being developed for the treatment of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Thymoquinone is one of the drugs that exhibits anticancer characteristics based on in vivo and in vitro models. This study further investigates the effects of thymoquinone on human gene expression using cDNA microarray technology. The quantification of RNA samples was carried out using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser to determine the RNA integrity number (RIN). The Agilent Low Input Quick Amplification Labelling kit was used to generate cRNA in two-color microarray analysis. Samples with RIN &gt;9.0 were used in this study. The universal human reference RNA was used as the common reference. The samples were labelled with cyanine-3 (cye-3) CTP dye and the universal human reference was labelled with cyanine-5 (cye-5) CTP dye. cRNA was purified with the RNeasy Plus Mini kit and quantified using a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer. The arrays were scanned data analysed using Feature Extraction and GeneSpring software. Two-step qRT-PCR was selected to determine the relative gene expression using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. The results from Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, indicated that 8 GO terms were related to biological processes (84%) and molecular functions (16%). A total of 577 entities showed &gt;2-fold change in expression. Of these entities, 45.2% showed an upregulation and 54.7% showed a downregulation in expression. The interpretation of single experiment analysis (SEA) revealed that the cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A8 (UGT1A8) genes in the estrogen metabolic pathway were downregulated significantly by 43- and 11‑fold, respectively. The solute carrier family 7 (anionic amino acid transporter light chain, xc-system), member 11 (SLC7A11) gene in the interferon pathway, reported to be involved in the development of chemoresistance, was downregulated by 15‑fold. The interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)1, IFIT2, IFIT3, interferon, α-inducible protein (IFI)6 (also known as G1P3), interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9, ISGF3), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, 40/46 kDa (OAS1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) genes all showed changes in expression following treatment with thymoquinone. The caspase 10, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (CASP10) gene was activated and the protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, R (PTPRR) and myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) genes were upregulated in the classical MAPK and p38 MAPK pathways. These findings indicate that thymquinone targets specific genes in the estrogen metabolic and interferon pathways.
Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Some dietary polyphenols, such as coffee polyphenols (CPPs), reduce cholesterol levels. The mechanism of this cholesterol-lowering effect is not fully understood, although 5-CQA, a major component of CPPs, reportedly inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the cholesterol-lowering effect of CPPs on the basis of cholesterol metabolism-related gene expression in the liver. We also examined the effects of CPPs on vascular lipid accumulation in zebrafish with high cholesterol diet-induced hypercholesterolemia.
Over 14 weeks, adult zebrafish were fed a control diet, a high-cholesterol diet, or the latter diet supplemented with CPPs. To measure the extent of vascular lipid accumulation, for 10 days larval zebrafish (which are optically transparent) were fed these same diets with the addition of a fluorescent cholesteryl ester.
In adult zebrafish, addition of CPPs to a high-cholesterol diet significantly suppressed the increase in plasma and liver cholesterol levels seen when fish ingested the same diet lacking CPPs. Transcription levels of the liver genes hmgcra (encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase A, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis) and mtp (encoding microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, a lipid transfer protein required for assembly and secretion of lipoproteins) were significantly lower in fish fed the CPP-containing diet than in fish fed the unsupplemented high-cholesterol diet. In contrast, the expression level of the liver gene cyp7a1a (encoding the cytochrome P450 polypeptide 1a of subfamily A of family 7, a rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid biosynthesis) increased significantly upon consumption of the CPP-containing diet. In larval fish, accumulation of fluorescently labeled cholesterol in the caudal artery was greatly reduced on the CPP-containing diet.
CPP ingestion suppressed cholesterol accumulation in the plasma, liver, and vascular system of zebrafish. Downregulation of cholesterol and lipoprotein synthesis and upregulation of bile acid synthesis in the liver may be the fundamental underlying mechanisms by which CPPs exert their hypocholesterolemic effects. CPP intake may help prevent and manage hypercholesterolemia in humans, and further investigations along these lines using a variety of CPP dose rates are warranted.
Vitamin D deficiency rickets is common in China. Genetic factors may play an important role in the susceptibility to rickets. Our study aimed to identify the relationship between three vitamin D-related genes (group specific component [GC], cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1 (CYP2R1), and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (DHCR7/NADSYN1) and rickets in Han Chinese children from northeastern China.
A total of 506 Han children from northeastern China were enrolled in the current study. Twelve SNPs in three candidate genes were genotyped using the SNaPshot assay. Linear regression was used to examine the effect of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of rickets.
In our case-control cohort, six alleles of the 12 SNPs conferred a significantly increased risk of rickets in GC (rs4588 C, P = 0.003, OR: 0.583, 95% CI: 0.412-0.836; rs222020 C, P = 0.009, OR: 1.526, 95% CI: 1.117-2.0985; rs2282679 A, P = 0.010, OR: 0.636, 95% CI: 0.449-0.900; and rs2298849 C, P = 0.001, OR: 1.709, 95% CI: 1.250-2.338) and in CYP2R1 (rs10741657 G, P = 0.019, OR: 1.467, 95% CI: 1.070-2.011; and rs2060793 G, P = 0.023, OR: 0.689, 95% CI: 0.502-0.944). The results remained significant after adjustment for sex and body mass index. We further analyzed the effect of genotypes under three different genetic models. After using Bonferroni's method for multiple corrections, rs4588, rs2282679, and rs2298849 of the GC gene were significantly associated with rickets under the dominant (P =0.003 for rs4588, P =0.024 for rs2282679, and P =0.005 for rs2298849) and additive models (P = 0.006 for rs4588, P = 0.024 for rs2282679, and P = 0.005 for rs2298849). Haplotype analysis showed that the CAT haplotype of the GC gene (P = 0.005) and the GAA haplotype of the CYP2R1 gene (P = 0.026) were associated with susceptibility to rickets.
This case-control study confirmed the strong effect of GC and CYP2R1 loci on rickets in Han children from northeastern China.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor which plays a role in the development of multiple tissues and is activated by a large number of ligands, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In order to examine the roles of the AHR in both normal biological development and response to environmental chemicals, an AHR knockout (AHR-KO) rat model was created and compared with an existing AHR-KO mouse. AHR-KO rats harboring either 2-bp or 29-bp deletion mutation in exon 2 of the AHR were created on the Sprague-Dawley genetic background using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) technology. Rats harboring either mutation type lacked expression of AHR protein in the liver. AHR-KO rats were also insensitive to thymic involution, increased hepatic weight and the induction of AHR-responsive genes (Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, Ahrr) following acute exposure to 25 μg/kg TCDD. AHR-KO rats had lower basal expression of transcripts for these genes and also accumulated ~30-45-fold less TCDD in the liver at 7 days post-exposure. In untreated animals, AHR-KO mice, but not AHR-KO rats, had alterations in serum analytes indicative of compromised hepatic function, patent ductus venosus of the liver and persistent hyaloid arteries in the eye. AHR-KO rats, but not AHR-KO mice, displayed pathological alterations to the urinary tract: bilateral renal dilation (hydronephrosis), secondary medullary tubular and uroepithelial degenerative changes and bilateral ureter dilation (hydroureter). The present data indicate that the AHR may play significantly different roles in tissue development and homeostasis and toxicity across rodent species.
Concern has recently been raised over the possibility of a reduced efficacy of clopidogrel because of genetic variations in cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19) metabolism. A black box warning from the US Food and Drug Administration recommends that all patients be tested. It has been estimated that approximately 3% (range 2-14%) of the population are poor metabolizers, but few data are available for cerebrovascular patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency and effects of variability in CYP2C19 metabolism in patients with cerebrovascular disease.
A retrospective review of all patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) tested for the clopidogrel CYP2C19 genotype was performed, with a collection of data including race/ethnicity, CYP2C19 status, and the presence of recurrent vascular events.
A total of 53 cerebrovascular patients were tested, consisting of 5.7% poor (n = 3), 26.4% intermediate (n = 14), 62.3% extensive (n = 33), 3.8% indeterminate (n = 2), and 1.9% "mixed ultra rapid and poor" (n = 1) metabolizers. Only 10 of 38 white patients (26.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.42) were intermediate or poor metabolizers, compared with 7 of 15 (46.7%; 95% CI 0.25-0.70) nonwhites. Of 43 patients treated with clopidogrel, 3 of 27 extensive metabolizers (11.1%; 95% CI 0.04-0.28) had recurrent cerebrovascular events compared with 33.3% of intermediate metabolizers (4/12; 95% CI 0.14-0.61) and 50% of poor metabolizers (1/2; 95% CI 0.09-0.90).
These data suggest that the proportion of poor/intermediate clopidogrel metabolizers in cerebrovascular patients is comparable to cardiovascular studies and these patients may have an increased risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events. Routine CYP2C19 testing may be warranted.
Does fibrin introduced into the extracellular matrix affect the growth and maturation of individual primate follicles during encapsulated three-dimensional (3D) culture?
While not altering follicle survival, fibrin-alginate (FIBRIN) improves macaque primary, but not secondary, follicle development during encapsulated 3D culture in terms of growth, steroidogenesis, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and oocyte maturation.
Efforts to grow non-human primate ovarian follicles from the secondary to the antral stage during encapsulated 3D culture have been successful. However, the growth and maturation of primary follicles in vitro has not been reported in primates, especially in chemically defined conditions.
In vitro follicle maturation was investigated using the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Ovaries (n = 7 pairs) were obtained during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (cycle day 1-4). Primary (80-120 µm diameter) and secondary (125-225 µm diameter) follicles were isolated mechanically, randomly assigned to experimental groups, encapsulated into alginate (0.25% w/v) or FIBRIN (25 mg/ml fibrinogen-0.25% alginate) and cultured for 13 and 5 weeks, respectively.
Individual follicles were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium supplemented with FSH. Follicle survival and growth were assessed by microscopy. Follicles that reached the antral stage were treated with recombinant hCG. Metaphase II (MII) oocytes were inseminated via ICSI. Follicle morphology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed for cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP17A1) and 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP19A1). Culture medium was analyzed for estradiol (E2) and progesterone by chemiluminescence, androstenedione (A4) by radioimmunoassay, as well as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
A total of 105 primary and 133 secondary follicles were collected. The presence of fibrin in the alginate matrix had no effect on either primary or secondary follicle survival. Growing primary and secondary follicles formed an antrum at Weeks 9 and 3, respectively. The percentage of growing follicles was higher (P &lt; 0.05) for primary follicles cultured in FIBRIN than alginate at Week 13. The diameters were larger for the growing secondary follicles cultured in alginate than FIBRIN at Week 5 (P &lt; 0.05). H&amp;E staining revealed the typical morphology for small antral follicles. CPY17A1 immunostaining was detected in theca cells, while CYP19A1 was observed in granulosa cells. E2 increased (P &lt; 0.05) during antrum formation in growing follicles at Week 9 for primary and Week 3 for secondary follicles. AMH levels in medium from growing primary follicles increased (P &lt; 0.05) after Week 4 with peak levels at Weeks 9-11. AMH increased (P &lt; 0.05) in growing secondary follicles at Weeks 3-5. VEGF levels in medium were elevated (P &lt; 0.05) in growing primary follicles at Week 9. VEGF increased (P &lt; 0.05) in medium from growing secondary follicles at Weeks 3-5. E2, AMH and VEGF production was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in primary follicle culture with FIBRIN than alginate alone. One primary follicle cultured in FIBRIN (1 of 5 follicles harvested) and a secondary follicle cultured in alginate alone (1 of 15 follicles harvested) yielded an MII oocyte. The fertilized oocyte from primary follicle culture arrested without cell division after fertilization, while the oocyte from secondary follicle culture cleaved and reached the morula stage.
The study reports on in vitro development and function of individual macaque follicles, that is limited to the interval from the primary and secondary stage to the small antral stage. The findings await translation to human ovarian follicles.
The 3D model for primate follicle development offers a unique opportunity to investigate the growth and regulation of primate primary, as well as secondary follicles, and their enclosed oocytes, as they grow to the antral stage by monitoring and manipulating factors or signaling pathways in vitro. Since primate primary follicles, in addition to secondary follicles, can be cultured to the antral stage to provide mature oocytes, they represent an additional source of pre-antral follicles for in vitro follicle maturation with the potential to provide gametes for assisted reproductive technology as an option for fertility preservation in women, including patients with cancer.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the expression of 8-OHdG (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine) in the benthic fish Zosterisessor ophiocephalus collected in two differently polluted sites of the Venetian lagoon (Porto Marghera and Caroman). We compared our data on 8-OHdG with those of CYP1A (Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1), which is a well known biomarker for detoxification of contaminants. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody to 8-OHdG showed immunopositivity in nuclei of hepatocytes as well as in melanomacrophage centres of spleen and kidney, whereas an anti-CYP1A antibody exhibited positive immunostaining in the liver, kidney and ovary. The liver of males showed higher expression of both proteins than females. In animals from Porto Marghera site, the enzymatic assay for 8-OHdG exhibited higher levels in liver of males than in females. Western Blot analysis using the antibody anti-CYP1A recognized the presence of a band of about 60 kDa in the liver of males and females. Males exhibited a strong band, whereas in females the band showed a lower intensity. By using Real-Time PCR, the mRNA expression of CYP1A did not show any differences between males and females from each site, but it was at borderline significance level. Comparing the two sites, mRNA expression of CYP1A was significantly higher in the liver of both males and females from Porto Marghera than that of Caroman. The present data suggest that pollutants are bio-available as demonstrated by our biomarker analyses and may have a harmful effect on aquatic organisms such as Z. ophiocephalus. We report that the highest levels of hepatic 8-OHdG and CYP1A expression were detected in males, showing clear gender specificity.
Dioxins are metabolized by cytochrome P450, family 1 (CYP1) via the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We determined whether different blood dioxin concentrations are associated with polymorphisms in AHR (dbSNP ID: rs2066853), AHR repressor (AHRR; rs2292596), CYP1 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1; rs4646903 and rs1048963), CYP1 subfamily A polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2; rs762551), and CYP1 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1; rs1056836) in pregnant Japanese women. These six polymorphisms were detected in 421 healthy pregnant Japanese women. Differences in dioxin exposure concentrations in maternal blood among the genotypes were investigated. Comparisons among the GG, GA, and AA genotypes of AHR showed a significant difference (genotype model: P=0.016 for the mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations and toxicity equivalence quantities [TEQs]). Second, we found a significant association with the dominant genotype model ([TT+TC] vs. CC: P=0.048 for the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin TEQs; P=0.035 for polychlorinated dibenzofuran TEQs) of CYP1A1 (rs4646903). No significant differences were found among blood dioxin concentrations and polymorphisms in AHRR, CYP1A1 (rs1048963), CYP1A2, and CYP1B1. Thus, polymorphisms in AHR and CYP1A1 (rs4646903) were associated with maternal dioxin concentrations. However, differences in blood dioxin concentrations were relatively low.
In primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients, elevated intraocular pressure usually leads to extracellular matrix remodeling and astrocytes activation. Thus, lamina cribrosa (LC) cells may play an important role in POAG progression. The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore gene expression profiles in LC cells of POAG patients.
Using the GSE13534 microarray datasets downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LC cells from POAG patients and controls were firstly screened based on the classical t-test and false discovery rate &lt;0.05 as a significant threshold. Subsequently, these DEGs were grouped into gene sets using a graph-clustering approach. The underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated by the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis.
A total of 57 DEGs were identified and 478 co-expression relationships were constructed among these DEGs. Among them, cytochrome p450 family 1 subfamily B (CYP1B1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and myelin basic protein (MBP) showed high-degree relationships and they could interact with several genes. CYP1B1 is an important genetic gene involved in POAG and BDNF is an effective growth neurotrophic factor to weak POAG damage. MBP, versican (VCAN), integrin, alpha 4 (ITGA4) and N-cadherin (CDH2) may be involved in extracellular matrix remodeling in LC cells. FZD2 and FZD7 were enriched in basal cell carcinoma pathway.
The results demonstrate that the genes above may be associated with the pathogenesis of POAG.
The COUP-TFII (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II) nuclear receptor, which is composed of a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, exerts pleiotropic effects on development and cell differentiation by regulating the transcription of its target genes, including Cyp7a1 (cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, polypeptide 1), which plays important roles in catabolism of cholesterol in the liver. Although multiple variants of COUP-TFII exist, their roles in the regulation of Cyp7a1 expression have not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the roles of COUP-TFII-V2 (variant 2), which lacks a DNA-binding domain, in the regulation of the transcriptional control of the Cyp7a1 gene by COUP-TFII in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We found that COUP-TFII-V2 was significantly expressed in Huh7 cells, in which Cyp7a1 was not expressed. Furthermore, knockdown of COUP-TFII-V2 enhanced endogenous Cyp7a1 expression in Huh7 cells. Although COUP-TFII activates the Cyp7a1 promoter through direct binding to DNA, this activation was affected by COUP-TFII-V2, which physically interacted with COUP-TFII and inhibited its DNA-binding ability. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that COUP-TFII-V2 inhibited the binding of endogenous COUP-TFII to the intact Cyp7a1 promoter. The results of the present study suggest that COUP-TFII-V2 negatively regulates the function of COUP-TFII by inhibiting its binding to DNA to decrease Cyp7a1 expression.
Osteoclast (OCL) precursors from many Paget's disease (PD) patients express measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP) and are hypersensitive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₂ (1,25-(OH)₂D₃; also know as calcitriol). The increased 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ sensitivity is mediated by transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 12 (TAF12), a coactivator of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is present at much higher levels in MVNP-expressing OCL precursors than normals. These results suggest that TAF12 plays an important role in the abnormal OCL activity in PD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying both 1,25-(OH)₂D₃'s effects on OCL formation and the contribution of TAF12 to these effects in both normals and PD patients are unclear. Inhibition of TAF12 with a specific TAF12 antisense construct decreased OCL formation and OCL precursors' sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ in PD patient bone marrow samples. Further, OCL precursors from transgenic mice in which TAF12 expression was targeted to the OCL lineage (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP]-TAF12 mice), formed OCLs at very low levels of 1,25-(OH)₂D₃, although the OCLs failed to exhibit other hallmarks of PD OCLs, including receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) hypersensitivity and hypermultinucleation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of OCL precursors using an anti-TAF12 antibody demonstrated that TAF12 binds the 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) promoter, which contains two functional vitamin D response elements (VDREs), in the presence of 1,25-(OH)₂D₃. Because TAF12 directly interacts with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7) and potentiates ATF7-induced transcriptional activation of ATF7-driven genes in other cell types, we determined whether TAF12 is a functional partner of ATF7 in OCL precursors. Immunoprecipitation of lysates from either wild-type (WT) or MVNP-expressing OCL with an anti-TAF12 antibody, followed by blotting with an anti-ATF7 antibody, or vice versa, showed that TAF12 and ATF7 physically interact in OCLs. Knockdown of ATF7 in MVNP-expressing cells decreased cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP24A1) induction by1,25-(OH)₂D₃, as well as TAF12 binding to the CYP24A1 promoter. These results show that ATF7 interacts with TAF12 and contributes to the hypersensitivity of OCL precursors to 1,25-(OH)₂D₃ in PD.
The Maasai are a pastoral people in Kenya and Tanzania, whose traditional diet of milk, blood and meat is rich in lactose, fat and cholesterol. In spite of this, they have low levels of blood cholesterol, and seldom suffer from gallstones or cardiac diseases. Field studies in the 1970s suggested that the Maasai have a genetic adaptation for cholesterol homeostasis. Analysis of HapMap 3 data using Fixation Index (Fst) and two metrics of haplotype diversity: the integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) and the Cross Population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (XP-EHH), identified genomic regions and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as strong candidates for recent selection for lactase persistence and cholesterol regulation in 143-156 founder individuals from the Maasai population in Kinyawa, Kenya (MKK). The non-synonmous SNP with the highest genome-wide Fst was the TC polymorphism at rs2241883 in Fatty Acid Binding Protein 1(FABP1), known to reduce low density lipoprotein and tri-glyceride levels in Europeans. The strongest signal identified by all three metrics was a 1.7 Mb region on Chr2q21. This region contains the genes LCT (Lactase) and MCM6 (Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component) involved in lactase persistence, and the gene Rab3GAP1 (Rab3 GTPase-activating Protein Catalytic Subunit), which contains polymorphisms associated with total cholesterol levels in a genome-wide association study of &gt;100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Sanger sequencing of DNA from six MKK samples showed that the GC-14010 polymorphism in the MCM6 gene, known to be associated with lactase persistence in Africans, is segregating in MKK at high frequency (∼58%). The Cytochrome P450 Family 3 Subfamily A (CYP3A) cluster of genes, involved in cholesterol metabolism, was identified by Fst and iHS as candidate loci under selection. Overall, our study identified several specific genomic regions under selection in the Maasai which contain polymorphisms in genes associated with lactase persistence and cholesterol regulation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance, abnormally elevated hepatic glucose production, and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Treatment with antihyperglycemic agents is initially successful in type 2 diabetes, but it is often associated with a high secondary failure rate, and the addition of insulin is eventually necessary for many patients, in order to restore acceptable glycemic control and to reduce the risk of development and progression of disease complications. Notably, even patients who appear to have similar requirements of antidiabetic regimens show great variability in drug disposition, glycemic response, tolerability, and incidence of adverse effects during treatment. Pharmacogenomics is a promising area of investigation and involves the search for genetic polymorphisms that may explain the interindividual variability in antidiabetic therapy response. The initial positive results portend that genomic efforts will be able to shed important light on variability in pharmacologic traits. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of genetic polymorphisms that may affect the responses of subjects with T2DM to antidiabetic treatment. These genes belong to three major classes: genes involved in drug metabolism and transporters that influence pharmacokinetics (including the cytochrome P450 [CYP] superfamily, the organic anion transporting polypeptide [OATP] family, and the polyspecific organic cation transporter [OCT] family); genes encoding drug targets and receptors (including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARG], the adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-sensitive potassium channel [K(ATP)], and incretin receptors); and genes involved in the causal pathway of T2DM that are able to modify the effects of drugs (including adipokines, transcription factor 7-like 2 (T cell specific, HMG-box) [TCF7L2], insulin receptor substrate 1 [IRS1], nitric oxide synthase 1 (neuronal) adaptor protein [NOS1AP], and solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 [SLC30A8]). In addition to these three major classes, we also review the available evidence on novel genes (CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1 [CDKAL1], insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 [IGF2BP2], potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 [KCNQ1], paired box 4 [PAX4] and neuronal differentiation 1 [NEUROD1] transcription factors, ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM], and serine racemase [SRR]) that have recently been proposed as possible modulators of therapeutic response in subjects with T2DM.
Aims: We designed this study to get insight into the disorder of lipid metabolism during cholesterol gallstone formation and evaluate the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on the improvement of bile lithogenicity and on expression of lipid related genes. Methods: Rabbit cholesterol gallstone models were induced by high cholesterol diet. Bile, blood and liver tissues were obtained from rabbits after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks. Bile and blood lipids were measured enzymatically. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP7A1) and sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) mRNA expressions were detected by using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Cholesterol saturation index (CSI) was calculated by using Carey table to represent the bile lithogenicity. Results: Rates of gallstone formation of the 4 and 5 week treatment groups were 100 %, but that of the ursodeoxycholic acid treatment group was only 33.3 %. Expression of HMGCR and SCP2 mRNA in the 4 week group was upregulated and that of CYP7A1 mRNA decreased as compared with the 0 week group. Ursodeoxycholic acid could significantly extend nucleation time of bile and lower CSI. Ursodeoxycholic acid could reduce the expression of SCP2, but couldn't influence expression of HMGCR and CYP7A1. Conclusions: Abnormal expression of HMGCR, CYP7A1 and SCP2 might lead to high lithogenicity of bile. Ursodeoxycholic acid could improve bile lipids and lower bile lithogenicity, thereby reducing the incidence of gallstones. So it might be a good preventive drug for cholesterol gallstones.
Abiraterone acetate is an orally administered potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP17), which is essential for synthesis of testosterone from cholesterol. Although decreasing serum testosterone through inhibition of testicular function is the first line of treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer, residual androgens may still be detected in patients treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists. Treatment with abiraterone results in rapid, and complete, inhibition of androgen synthesis in the adrenal glands and potentially within the tumor itself. An overall survival benefit of maximal androgen suppression was recently shown in a randomized placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial of abiraterone with prednisone versus prednisone in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel chemotherapy. Abiraterone's efficacy shows the importance of androgen signaling in patients with castrate-resistant metastatic disease, with additional confirmation from recent studies of other novel agents such as MDV3100, an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor. These promising results now pose a new angle to an old problem about hormonal therapy and raise new questions about how resistance develops, how to best sequence therapy, and how to optimize combinations with other emerging novel agents.
Probe-based PCR is widely used for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping and pathogen nucleic acid detection due to its simplicity, sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. However, the multiplex capability of hydrolysis probe-based PCR is normally limited to one target (pathogen or allele) per fluorescence channel. Current fluorescence PCR machines typically have 4-6 channels. We present a strategy permitting the multiplex detection of multiple targets in a single detection channel. The technique is named Multiplex Probe Amplification (MPA). Polymorphisms of the CYP2C9 gene (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9, CYP2C9*2) and human papillomavirus sequences HPV16, 18, 31, 52 and 59 were chosen as model targets for testing MPA. The allele status of the CYP2C9*2 determined by MPA was entirely concordant with the reference TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays. The four HPV strain sequences could be independently detected in a single fluorescence detection channel. The results validate the multiplex capacity, the simplicity and accuracy of MPA for SNP genotyping and multiplex detection using different probes labeled with the same fluorophore. The technique offers a new way to multiplex in a single detection channel of a closed-tube PCR.
We examined the effects of lactic acid fermentation of soymilk on the lipid profile and lipid metabolism-related gene expression in rat liver. Male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 7 weeks were fed a control diet (AIN-93), soymilk diet, or fermented soymilk diet for 1 week or 5 weeks. The hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents in the soymilk (SM) group and the fermented soymilk (FSM) group were significantly lower than those in the control group after 5 weeks, but these changes had not become apparent until after 1 week. The fatty acid synthesis-related genes were more markedly down-regulated after 1 week than after 5 weeks, whereas the cytochrome p450 family 7 subfamily a polypeptide 1 (CYP7al) gene related to cholesterol catabolism was more markedly up-regulated after 5 weeks than after 1 week. This up-regulation was higher in the FSM group than in the SM group. It is assumed that the bioactive components produced by lactic acid fermentation induced the up-regulation of CYP7a1.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) activation by fenofibrate reduces blood pressure and sodium retention during DOCA-salt hypertension. PPAR-α activation reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Fenofibrate also induces cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) and increases 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) production. This study tested whether the administration of fenofibrate would reduce blood pressure by attenuating plasma IL-6 and renal expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), while increasing expression of renal CYP4A during 7 days of DOCA-salt hypertension. We performed uni-nephrectomy on 12-14 week old male Swiss Webster mice and implanted biotelemetry devices in control, DOCA-salt (1.5 mg/g) treated mice with or without fenofibrate (500 mg/kg/day in corn oil, intragastrically). Fenofibrate significantly decreased mean arterial pressure and plasma IL-6. In kidney homogenates, fenofibrate increased CYP4A and decreased COX-2 expression. There were no differences in renal cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily c, polypeptide 23 (CYP2C23) and soluble expoxide hydrolase (sEH) expression between the groups. Our results suggest that the blood pressure lowering effect of PPAR-α activation by fenofibrate involves the reduction of plasma IL-6 and COX-2, while increasing CYP4A expression during DOCA-salt hypertension. Our results may also suggest that PPAR-α activation protects the kidney against renal injury via decreased COX-2 expression.
Chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes, caused by homologous recombination between CYP21A2 (cytochrome P450, family 21, subfamily A, polypeptide 2) and its highly homologous pseudogene CYP21A1P (cytochrome P450, family 21, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 pseudogene), are common in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). A comprehensive junction site analysis of chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes is needed for optimizing genetic analysis strategy and determining clinical relevance.
We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes in a cohort of 202 unrelated 21-OHD patients. Targeted CYP21A2 mutation analysis was performed, and genotyping of chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes was cross-confirmed with Southern blot, RFLP, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analyses. Junction sites of chimera genes were determined by sequencing the long-PCR products amplified with primers CYP779f and Tena32F. An updated bioinformatics survey of Chi-like sequences was also performed.
Of 100 probands with a chimeric allele, 96 had a chimera associated with the severe classic salt-wasting form of CAH, and the remaining 4 carried an uncommon attenuated chimera with junction sites upstream of In2G (c.293-13A/C&gt;G), which is associated with a milder phenotype. In addition to 6 of 7 reported chimeras, we identified a novel classic chimera (CH-8) and a novel attenuated chimera (CH-9). Attenuated chimeras explained prior genotype-phenotype discrepancies in 3 of the patients. Sequencing the CYP779f/Tena32F amplicons accurately differentiated between classic and attenuated chimeras. The bioinformatics survey revealed enrichment of Chi-like sequences within or in the vicinity of intron 2.
Junction site analysis can explain some genotype-phenotype discrepancies. Sequencing the well-established CYP779f/Tena32F amplicons is an unequivocal strategy for detecting attenuated chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes, which are clinically relevant.
Sirolimus (SRL) absorption and metabolism are affected by p-glycoprotein-mediated transport and CYP3A enzyme activity, which are further under the influences of cytokine concentrations. This retrospective study determined the associations of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) 1236C&gt;T, 2677 G&gt;T/A, and 3435C&gt;T, cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) -392A&gt;G, cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5) 6986A&gt;G and 14690G&gt;A, interleukin (IL)-10 -1082G&gt;A, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -308G&gt;A polymorphisms with SRL dose-adjusted, weight-normalized trough concentrations (C/D) at 7 days, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of SRL.
Genotypes for 86 renal transplant patients who received SRL-based maintenance immunosuppressive therapy were determined using polymerase chain reaction followed by chip-based mass spectrometry. The changes of log-transformed C/D over the days posttransplantation were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model, with adjustments for body mass index and weight-normalized doses of tacrolimus, prednisone, clotrimazole, and statins.
ABCB1 3435C&gt;T and IL-10 -1082G&gt;A were significantly associated with log C/D (P=0.0016 and 0.0394, respectively). Mean SRL C/D was 48% higher in patients with ABCB1 3435CT/TT genotype than those with 3435CC genotype, and was 24% higher in IL-10 -1082GG compared with -1082AG/AA.
ABCB1 3435C&gt;T and IL-10 -1082G&gt;A were significantly associated with long-term SRL dose requirements. Genetics can play a significant role in SRL dosing and may be useful in therapeutic monitoring of SRL in renal transplantation. Future replication studies are needed to confirm these associations.
Tacrolimus (Tac) is a potent immunosuppressant with considerable toxicity. Tac pharmacokinetics varies between individuals and thus complicates its use in preventing rejection after kidney transplantation. This variability might be caused by genetic polymorphisms in metabolizing enzymes.
We used TaqMan analyses to evaluate the impact of a newly discovered CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs35599367C&gt;T; CYP3A4*22) on Tac pharmacokinetics in 185 renal transplant recipients who participated in an international randomized controlled clinical trial (fixed-dose, concentration-controlled study).
The overall mean daily-dose requirement to reach the same predose Tac blood concentration was 33% lower for carriers of the T variant allele than for rs35599367CC patients (95% CI, -46% to -20%; P = 0.018). When combined with the *3 genotype of the CYP3A5 (cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5) gene, the rs35599367C&gt;T SNP was also associated with a risk of supratherapeutic Tac concentrations (&gt;15 μg/L) during the first 3 days after surgery, with an odds ratio of 8.7 for carriers of the CYP3A4 T allele plus CYP3A5*3/*3 (P = 0.027) and 4.2 for the CYP3A4 CC homozygotes plus CYP3A5*3/*3 (P = 0.002), compared with CYP3A4 CC homozygotes having 1 or 2 CYP3A5*1 alleles. The overall increase in the Tac dose-adjusted trough blood concentration was +179% for carriers of the CYP3A4 T allele with CYP3A5*3/*3 (P &lt; 0.001), +101% for CYP3A4 CC homozygotes with CYP3A5*3/*3 (P &lt; 0.001), and +64% for CYP3A4 T allele carriers with CYP3A5*1 (P = 0.020),compared with CYP3A4 CC homozygotes with CYP3A5*1.
The CYP3A4 rs35599367C&gt;T polymorphism is associated with a significantly altered Tac metabolism and therefore increases the risk of supratherapeutic Tac concentrations early after transplantation. Analysis of this CYP3A4*22 SNP may help in identifying patients at risk of Tac overexposure.
To evaluate the effect of cocoa flavonoids in breast cancer cells at the molecular level, a functional genomic analysis was performed using a polyphenolic cocoa extract (PCE) in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cell lines.
The expression profile of 84 genes included in the Stress &amp; Toxicity PathwayFinder™ PCR Array was analyzed after PCE incubation for 24 h. mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Gel shift assays were used to evaluate DNA-protein complexes. Protein complexes were identified by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assays.
Upon PCE incubation, 7 genes were overexpressed and 1 underexpressed in MCF-7 cells, whereas 9 genes were overexpressed in SKBR3 cells. Among the differentially expressed genes in both cell lines, cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) was chosen for further study. CYP1A1 mRNA and protein levels and enzymatic activity increased upon PCE incubation. CYP1A1 transcriptional activation by PCE was mediated through AhR binding to XRE elements within the CYP1A1 promoter in MCF-7 cells. A protein complex including AhR and ERα was detected. The combination of PCE with tamoxifen caused a synergistic cytotoxicity in both cell lines and was due to an increase in apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.
The interaction between ERα and AhR upon incubation with PCE leads to CYP1A1 induction in breast cancer cells. The synergy between PCE and non-cytotoxic tamoxifen concentrations opens the possibility for a combination therapy based on polyphenols from cocoa that increased tamoxifen efficacy.
The main genes involved in the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressive drugs are those encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) family enzymes and multidrug resistance 1 (ABCB1). In this study, 87 Italian teenagers with transplanted kidneys (mean age 11.6 ± 4.8 years) receiving calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) CYP3A5*1/3 and CYP3A4*1B for CYP3A, and C1236T, G2677T/A, C3435T and IVS21+49 for ABCB1, and retrospectively evaluated for the influence of the screened SNPs on CNI blood level at different post-transplantation times. The CYP3A5*1 allele was present in 7% of the patients, and the CYP3A4*1B allele was present in 3% of patients. The ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs C, G and T occurred frequently (55%, 53% and 54%, respectively). The frequency of the T allele of IVS21+49 was 86%. The frequency of SNPs in both genes was comparable with that reported in other European Caucasian populations but different from that found in Asians or Afro-Americans. None of the cyclosporine (CsA) pharmacokinetic parameters were associated with the CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism, whereas the presence of the A allele in some patients was responsible for the required administration of a significantly increased dose of tacrolimus (Tac) that was necessary to reach therapeutic target levels. None of the Tac pharmacokinetic parameters were associated with ABCB1 SNPs, but ABCB1 SNPs had early effects on the CsA exposure index and dose requirements. In conclusion, because SNPs of the CYP3A and ABCB1 genes may be associated with CNI pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure indices, pre-transplant genetic screening should be considered in order to avoid immunosuppressant-related adverse events.
This two-way crossover study investigated possible differences between the proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole and rabeprazole, in their effect on gastric acid secretion in Japanese subjects with differing cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19) genotypes. A total of 23 Helicobacter pylori-negative healthy volunteers received omeprazole 20 mg/day and rabeprazole 10 mg/day. Each drug treatment was given for a continuous 7-day period allocated in random order, with an interval of at least 1 week between drug treatment periods to allow for wash-out. Intragastric pH was measured on days 1 and 7. Overall median intragastric pH levels at 7 and 8 h after the first administration were significantly higher with omeprazole. There was no significant difference in intragastric pH in homozygous extensive metabolizers, whereas intragastric pH was significantly higher with omeprazole in combined data from heterozygous extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers at 6, 7 and 8 h after the first drug administration. There were no significant differences in intragastric pH between omeprazole and rabeprazole irrespective of genotype on day 7 of administration. In conclusion, on day 1 the time to onset of the antisecretory action of 20 mg/day omeprazole was more rapid than that of 10 mg/day rabeprazole in Japanese individuals who have a higher incidence of the CYP2C19 poor metabolizer genotype, however by day 7 no difference in antisecretory effect was found, regardless of genotype.
The primary circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], is associated with multiple medical outcomes, including rickets, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis and cancer. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4501 persons of European ancestry drawn from five cohorts, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding group-specific component (vitamin D binding) protein, GC, on chromosome 4q12-13 that were associated with 25(OH)D concentrations: rs2282679 (P=2.0x10(-30)), in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs7041, a non-synonymous SNP (D432E; P=4.1x10(-22)) and rs1155563 (P=3.8x10(-25)). Suggestive signals for association with 25(OH)D were also observed for SNPs in or near three other genes involved in vitamin D synthesis or activation: rs3829251 on chromosome 11q13.4 in NADSYN1 [encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetase; P=8.8x10(-7)], which was in high LD with rs1790349, located in DHCR7, the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that synthesizes cholesterol from 7-dehydrocholesterol; rs6599638 in the region harboring the open-reading frame 88 (C10orf88) on chromosome 10q26.13 in the vicinity of ACADSB (acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase), involved in cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis (P=3.3x10(-7)); and rs2060793 on chromosome 11p15.2 in CYP2R1 (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1, encoding a key C-25 hydroxylase that converts vitamin D3 to an active vitamin D receptor ligand; P=1.4x10(-5)). We genotyped SNPs in these four regions in 2221 additional samples and confirmed strong genome-wide significant associations with 25(OH)D through meta-analysis with the GWAS data for GC (P=1.8x10(-49)), NADSYN1/DHCR7 (P=3.4x10(-9)) and CYP2R1 (P=2.9x10(-17)), but not C10orf88 (P=2.4x10(-5)).
The anticancer agent docetaxel shows significant inter-individual variation in its pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile. Thalidomide is an active anticancer agent and also shows wide pharmacological variation. Past pharmacogenetic research has not explained this variation. Patients with prostate cancer enrolled in a randomized phase II trial using docetaxel and thalidomide versus docetaxel alone were genotyped using the Affymetrix DMET 1.0 platform, which tests for 1256 genetic variations in 170 drug disposition genes. Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed for associations with clinical response and toxicity. In all, 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes were potentially associated with response to therapy: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-delta), sulfotransferase family, cytosolic, 1C, member 2 (SULT1C2) and carbohydrate (chondroitin 6) sulfotransferase 3 (CHST3). In addition, 11 SNPs in eight genes were associated with toxicities to treatment: spastic paraplegia 7 (pure and complicated autosomal recessive) (SPG7), CHST3, cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6), N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) (NAT2), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 6 (ABCC6), ATPase, Cu++ transporting, alpha polypeptide (ATP7A), cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP4B1) and solute carrier family 10 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family), member 2 (SLC10A2). Genotyping results between drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) and direct sequencing showed &gt;96% of concordance. These findings highlight the role that non-CYP450 metabolizing enzymes and transporters may have in the pharmacology of docetaxel and thalidomide.
To clarify whether enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ) or melatonin (MLT) supplementation reduces oxidative stress-mediated hepatocellular tumor-promoting effect of oxfendazole (OX), a benzimidazole anthelmintic, male rats were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and were fed a diet containing OX (500 ppm) for 10 weeks with or without EMIQ (2,000 ppm) or MLT (100 ppm) in the drinking water after DEN initiation. One week after the commencement of the administration of OX, rats were subjected to two-thirds of partial hepatectomy. The number of GST-P-positive foci promoted by OX was significantly inhibited by the combined antioxidant EMIQ or MLT administration, and the area of GST-P-positive foci was inhibited by the administration of MLT. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed decreases in mRNA expression levels of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily b, polypeptide 2 (Cyp2b2) and malic enzyme 1 (Me1) in the DEN-OX-EMIQ and DEN-OX-MLT groups and decreases in mRNA expression levels of Cyp1a1 and aldo-keto reductase family 7, member A3 (Akr7a3) in the DEN-OX-MLT group compared to those in the DEN-OX group. In in vitro ROS production assay, inhibited production of NADPH-dependent ROS was observed by the treatment with EMIQ or MLT. These results suggest that coadministration of EMIQ or MLT suppresses the hepatocellular tumor-promoting activity of OX in rats through the decrease in ROS production by the activation of CYPs.
An inherited profile of genes related to the response to aggressive environmental factors such as viruses and chemicals may be related to an increased susceptibility to Graves' disease (GD).
This prospective case-control study was designed to examine the relationship between human herpesviruses (HHV) infection, determined by circulating DNA; tumour protein p53 (TP53) apoptotic ability; and detoxification system genes, and GD. We studied 280 confirmed GD patients paired to 284 controls with respect to environmental exposure. Exclusion criteria included medications that could interfere with thyroid function evaluation and a recent history of viral and bacterial infections.
A stepwise regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and ethnicity established the inheritance of glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) (odds ratio (OR)=3.423; 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.120-5.527; P&lt;0.001) and cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) variants (OR=1.649; 95% CI=1.012-2.686; P=0.0445) as significant risk factors for the disease. HHV-7 infection was much more common in GD patients (64.64%) than in controls (38.73%; chi(2), P&lt;0.0001), and it increased the risk for GD more than three times (OR=3.133; 95% CI=1.959-5.011; P&lt;0.0001). The inheritance of less efficient Pro/Pro TP53 gene variants significantly increased the risk of GD development (OR=5.196; 95% CI=2.112-12.783; P&lt;0.0001) and also favored HHV-7 infection (OR=2.835; 95% CI=1.100-7.310; P=0.0275). In addition, 72TP53 variants augmented the risk of GD relapse (OR=1.860; 95% CI=1.015-3.410; P=0.0446).
We suggest that an inherited genetic profile involving TP53 may favor HHV-7 infection and maintenance, which, in turn, may initiate and perpetuate GD autoimmune process.
Disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate (FM-VP4) is a synthetic compound derived from sitostanol and campestanol that has proved to be efficient as a cholesterol-lowering therapy in mice and human subjects. However, the mechanism of action of FM-VP4 remains unknown. The present study tests the ability of FM-VP4 to alter intestinal and liver cholesterol homeostasis in mice. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control chow or a 2 % FM-VP4-enriched diet for 4 weeks. FM-VP4 reduced the in vivo net intestinal cholesterol absorption and plasma and liver cholesterol concentrations by 2.2-, 1.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared with control mice. Furthermore, FM-VP4 also showed an impact on bile acid homeostasis. In FM-VP4 mice, liver and intestinal bile acid content was increased by 1.3- and 2.3-fold, respectively, whereas faecal bile acid output was 3.3-fold lower. FM-VP4 also increased the intestinal absorption of orally administered [3H]taurocholic acid to small intestine in vivo. Inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption by FM-VP4 was not mediated via transcriptional increases in intestine liver X receptor (LXR)-alpha, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter (ABC)-A1, ABCG5/G8 nor to decreases in intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) expression. In contrast, FM-VP4 up-regulated liver LXRalpha, ABCA1, ABCG5, scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA-R) gene expression, whereas it down-regulated several farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-target genes such as cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP7A1) and Na+/taurocholate co-transporter polypeptide (NTCP). In conclusion, FM-VP4 reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption, plasma and liver cholesterol and affected bile acid homeostasis by inducing bile acid intestinal reabsorption and changed the liver expression of genes that play an essential role in cholesterol homeostasis. This is the first phytosterol or stanol that affects bile acid metabolism and lowers plasma cholesterol levels in normocholesterolaemic mice.
Lung cancer remains a leading cause of disease globally, with smoking being the largest single cause. Phase I enzymes, including cytochrome P(450), family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1), are involved in the activation of carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to reactive intermediates that are capable of binding covalently to DNA to form DNA adducts, potentially initiating the carcinogenic process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of CYP1A1 gene polymorphisms and haplotypes with lung cancer risk. A case-control study was carried out on 1,040 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 784 controls to investigate three CYP1A1 variants, CYP1A1*2A (rs4646903; thymidine to cytosine substitution at nucleotide 3801 (3801T&gt;C)), CYP1A1*2C (rs1048943; 2455A&gt;G; substitution of isoleucine 462 with valine (exon 7)) and CYP1A1*4 (rs1799814; 2453C&gt;A; substitution of threonine 461 with asparagine (exon 7)) using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. The CYP1A1*2A and CYP1A1*2C variants were significantly over-represented in NSCLC cases compared with controls, whereas the CYP1A1*4 variant was under-represented. CYP1A1 haplotypes (in allele order CYP1A1*4, CYP1A1*2C, CYP1A1*2A) CGC and CGT were associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, whereas AAT was associated with decreased lung cancer risk in this population. The present study has identified risk haplotypes for CYP1A1 in NSCLC and confirmed that CYP1A1 polymorphisms are a minor risk factor for NSCLC.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex multi-factorial disorder involving a number of genetic and environmental factors. CYP1A1 (Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) gene, which belongs to Cytochrome P450 (CYP) super family, encodes a phase I cytochrome P450 enzyme, involved in the oxidative metabolism of estrogens. A recent study suggested that a common polymorphism Ile462Val of the CYP1A1 gene might be associated with PCOS development in Turkish women. To investigate a possible association between the CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and PCOS in Chinese women, we examined 205 PCOS patients and 177 healthy controls. All subjects were genotyped for CYP1A1. There was no statistical difference in CYP1A1 genotype and allele frequencies between PCOS cases and controls (chi(2) = 0.956, df = 2, P = 0.089 by genotype; chi(2) = 0.005, df = 1, P = 0.941 by allele). Compared with controls, there were no statistical difference in Val/Val genotype and Val allele frequency in the PCOS cases (4.9% vs. 5.1% by genotype; 51.7% vs. 52.0% by allele) (chi(2) = 0.009, df = 1, P = 0.926 by genotype; chi(2) = 0.005, df = 1, P = 0.941 by allele). Moreover, no association between CYP1A1 Ile462Val genotypes and metabolic parameters was observed in PCOS women. Our findings clearly indicated that this polymorphism does not represent an additional genetic risk factor for PCOS in Chinese women.
Cholesterol (CH) homeostasis in the liver is regulated by enzymes of CH synthesis such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and catabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P-450, family 7, subfamily A, and polypeptide 1 (CYP7A1). Since a circadian clock controls the gene expression of these enzymes, these genes exhibit circadian rhythm in the liver. In this study, we examined the relationship between a diet containing CH and/or cholic acid (CA) and the circadian regulation of Hmgcr, low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr), and Cyp7a1 gene expression in the mouse liver. A 4-wk CA diet lowered and eventually abolished the circadian expression of these genes. Not only clock genes such as period homolog 2 (Drosophila) (Per2) and brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) but also clock-controlled genes such as Hmgcr, Ldlr, and Cyp7a1 showed a reduced and arrhythmic expression pattern in the liver of Clock mutant mice. The reduced gene expression of Cyp7a1 in mice fed a diet containing CA or CH + CA was remarkable in the liver of Clock mutants compared with wild-type mice, and high liver CH accumulation was apparent in Clock mutant mice. In contrast, a CH diet without CA only elevated Cyp7a1 expression in both wild-type and Clock mutant mice. The present findings indicate that normal circadian clock function is important for the regulation of CH homeostasis in the mouse liver, especially in conjunction with a diet containing high CH and CA.
Gaobeidian Lake, located in Beijing, China, derives its water mainly from the effluent of the Gaobeidian Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is moderately polluted. Additionally, as this water is used as a coolant in the nearby thermal power plant, the water of this lake has an elevated temperature. To screen differential gene expression in Gaobeidian Lake, suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) methodology was performed on RNA in goldfish Carassius auratus hepatic tissues from the lake, using Huairou Reservoir as reference site. A total of 768 candidate clones were selected to perform differential screening. Of these, 264 clones were differentially expressed between the two sites, 124 of which were then subjected to DNA sequencing. Consequently, 36 different genes with known functions were obtained, and some of these differential genes were further confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments. Many genes related to detoxification, stress and immune response, and metabolism, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily b, polypeptide 10 (CYP2B10), CYP2X10, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and apolipoprotein A-I (Apo-AI), had higher expression levels in goldfish hepatic tissue from Gaobeidian Lake than those from the reference site. A set of nine genes with known functions were downregulated in Gaobeidian Lake compared to the reference site. The results provided evidence that organisms inhabiting Gaobeidian Lake were suffering a complex stress process and showing metabolism changes and disturbance of homeostasis.
We have analyzed the effects of low-dose transplacental and lactational exposure of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on gene expression relating to the dioxin and sexual hormone cascade, and demonstrated the effects on testicular growth and sexual maturation in male offspring rats. TCDD (10 ng/kg) was administered to dams on Days 7 and 14 of gestation, and on Days 0, 7 and 14 after delivery. Gene expression of cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) in the liver of 17-day-old rats was significantly increased compared with controls. Furthermore, expression of estrogen receptors (ER)alpha and ERbeta was significantly increased at 17 and 42 days old, respectively in the testis of TCDD-administered rats compared with controls. Although testicular weight and the seminiferous tubule diameter were increased in 17-day-old rats, there was no difference in the number of germ cells between TCDD-treated and control animals. The expressions of androgen receptor and inhibin subunit genes were not significantly changed. These findings suggest that low-dose exposure of TCDD leads to unusual development of the testis by perturbation of steroid hormone homeostasis.
Paraquat (PQ) is a well-known pneumotoxicant and provides an established model of oxidative stress. This study focused on the transcriptional response to PQ-driven oxidative stress in rat lungs during an early phase post-injection. Rats were sacrificed at 3 h and 24 h after PQ injection (i.p., 20 mg/kg b.w.), and at 3 h after a second injection (i.p., 20 mg/kg b.w.). The left lungs were rapidly excised and used immediately for RNA preparation. The lung tissues did not show any pathological damage microscopically. Differential expression of RNAs in the lung at 3 h was investigated using a DNA array system. Fifteen genes showed a &gt;1.7-fold change in expression level, which was confirmed by real-time PCR. Five genes related to oxidative stress, TRX, HO-1, GST-Yc, NQO-1, and RL/IF-1, and one gene, CLK3, whose function is unknown, showed a significant increase in their expression due to PQ injection. Two genes, HO-1 and NQO-1, that showed 3- and 2-fold increases at 3-h post-injection, were localized by immunohistochemistry. HO-1 was expressed in the bronchial epithelial cells, some type II cells and macrophages of control lungs, and the cells, especially the bronchial epithelial cells, were strongly stained 3 h following PQ treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis of NQO-1 also showed an increase in positive staining in the bronchial epithelial cells of PQ-treated lung sections. The expression of CYP2C6, 2C7, and 2C12, which are specific to or dominant in female liver, decreased markedly, while the male-specific CYP2C13 and 2C11 showed an increase or no effect. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of these CYP2C family genes on the early phase of PQ toxicity. These results indicate that the acclimation to oxidative stress is already a highly complex process at the onset of PQ-induced damage and that the genes described herein may prove to be major contributors to the subsequent pulmonary fibrosis.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Chinese soft-shelled turtle whole egg powder (TE) on cholesterol metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats to determine whether it has a cholesterol-lowering effect. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with TE (0, 0.75, 1.50 or 3.00 g/kg body weight) administrated by gavage for 24 weeks. Serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and faecal total bile acids levels were determined by enzymatic methods. Faecal steroid concentrations were measured by GC. Means and standard deviations were calculated where appropriate for values, and the data were tested by one-way ANOVA. After 24 weeks of feeding a high-fat diet with TE supplementation, serum TC and LDL-C levels, liver cholesterol and liver lipid levels were reduced in rats. TE supplementation did not affect the faecal output, but significantly increased steroid concentrations in faeces, indicating increased steroids excretion. The faecal bile acid excretion was also increased as evidence by elevated mRNA level of liver cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1. Our results demonstrated that the TE does have a cholesterol-lowering effect by increasing the excretion of total bile acids and neutral steroids.
Libraries of randomized ribozymes have considerable potential as tools for the identification of functional genes critically involved in a biological phenotype of interest in vitro. We have used a ribozyme library in an in vivo mouse model to identify genes related to metastasis. We injected weakly metastatic melanoma cells that had been treated with the library intravenously into mice. We then isolated ribozymes that accelerated metastasis from pulmonary tumors that had developed from metastasizing cells. As candidates for metastasis-related genes that were targets of the isolated ribozymes, we identified five unknown and three known genes: stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), polymerase gamma2 accessory subunit (Polg2), and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily d, polypeptide 22 (Cyp2d22). Repression of four of these by small interfering RNAs indeed resulted in the accelerated mobility of cells in in vitro scratch-wound assay. The further characterization of these candidate genes would provide clues to the complex mechanism(s) of metastasis.
In this study, we describe the characterisation of the complement component C4 gene in Fugu rubripes. The Fugu C4 gene, orthologous to the tetrapod C4 gene, encompasses a genomic span of 9702 base pairs and contains 41 exons, encoding the typical C4 three-chain polypeptide. The gene encodes a protein containing 1703 amino acids. The Fugu C4 protein demonstrates the presence of 25 conserved cysteine residues, as well as conservation of the functionally important thioester site. Complete sequencing of one cosmid and sequence scans from a cluster of 18 overlapping BAC clones, centering around the C4 gene, have identified the short-range linkage with five orthologous human genes mapping to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) including: tenascin X (TNX); cytochrome P450, subfamily XXIA, polypeptide 2 (CYP21A2); allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1) and casein kinase 2, beta polypeptide (CSNK2B), all found in the MHC class III region; and retinoid X receptor, beta (RXRB),which resides in the MHC extended class II region. To date, this syntenic association of the Fugu C4 and other MHC class III region genes has not been observed in other teleost fish. Data from the recent whole-genome shotgun assemblies reveal the Fugu MHC-related cluster of genes to be flanked predominantly by genes mapping to human chromosomes 7 and 19. All of the six identified Fugu MHC-related genes have been characterised at the genomic level.
Cytochrome P450s are heme-containing proteins which evolved from an ancestral gene to form a large superfamily of enzymes. We previously isolated three distinct CYP2C cDNAs, namely CYP2C25, 2C26, and 2C27, from liver cDNA libraries of male and female Syrian hamsters. In the present study, we isolated another cDNA clone, assigned as CYP2C28, from the same male cDNA library. This cDNA consisted of 1556 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 490 amino acids. CYP2C28 showed relatively low identities to other hamster CYP2C forms (71.4-72.6% in amino acid sequences) and showed the highest similarity to rat CYP2C24 (88.7%), while the other hamster CYP2C forms showed high similarities among themselves (&gt; 90.2%). CYP2C28 protein expressed in yeast catalyzed the N-demethylation of aminopyrine and benzphetamine, but did not catalyze the hydroxylation of tolbutamide, testosterone, and progesterone. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that CYP2C28 mRNA was expressed in hamster livers 1 week after birth, when the other hamster CYP2C forms were not detectable. The level of CYP2C28 mRNA increased to 3 weeks and then decreased with time in males. The level in females was lower than that in males. In adult hamsters, CYP2C28 was induced almost threefold by administration of phenobarbital but not affected by 3-methycholanthrene. On the other hand, administration of pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile induced CYP2C28 in females but not in males. These results indicate that CYP2C28 is a unique form in the hamster CYP2C subfamily.
A cytochrome P-450 (P-450), designated P-450HK omega, has been isolated and purified from human kidney microsomes to a specific content of 13 nmoles of P-450/mg of protein. P-450HK omega showed an apparent molecular weight of 52,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Absolute spectra of the oxidized form indicated that this P-450 was largely in the low-spin state and partly in the high-spin state. It catalyzed the omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxylation of fatty acids such as laurate, myristate, and palmitate, with no activity toward prostaglandin A1, benzphetamine, 7-ethoxycoumarin, or 7-ethoxyresorufin. The first 35 NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of P-450HK omega had about 70% homology with those of rabbit kidney fatty acid omega-hydroxylases of the P-450 IVA gene subfamily, P-450ka-1, P-450ka-2, and P-450kd, except for four undetermined residues. Moreover, Western blot and immuno-inhibition studies showed that P-450HK omega reacted with an antibody against the rabbit kidney fatty acid omega-hydroxylase. The results suggest that P-450HK omega is a member of the same P-450 gene family (IVA subfamily) as the rabbit enzymes. In addition, the terminal sequence of P-450HK omega also showed 54% homology with that of P-450k-2, a fatty acid omega-hydroxylase from rat kidney microsomes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a P-450 specific for fatty acid omega-hydroxylase activity has been isolated to homogeneity from human tissues.
We have isolated a cDNA clone for a P-450, designated P-450ib (Ichihara, K., Kusunose, E., Kaku, M., Yamamoto, S., and Kusunose, M. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 831, 99-105), from a cDNA library of rabbit small intestine mucosa by using synthetic DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction, as a hybridization probe. The cDNA with a 1,829-base pair insert encodes a polypeptide of 501 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains all of the sequences of the NH2-terminal and 14 tryptic fragments from purified P-450ib. As the NH2-terminal methionine was not found in the sequence from the purified protein, the apoprotein of P-450ib is composed of 500 amino acids with a molecular weight of 57,193. P-450ib shows 35-41% sequence similarity with several members of 8 subfamilies in the P-450 II family, whereas it has a less than 30% sequence similarity with other P-450 families, suggesting that this P-450 is the first member of a novel subfamily within the P-450 II family. RNA blot analysis shows that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA is expressed in the small intestine, but not significantly in other tissues including liver, colon, kidney, lung, spleen, brain, stomach, and cecum, indicating that P-450ib is a P-450 specific to the small intestine. The protein expressed in COS-7 cells using the cDNA in an expression vector, pKCRH2, shows benzphetamine N-demethylase activity and gives a band identical with that of P-450ib in its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
What are the direct effects and physiological role of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) during primate follicular development and function at specific stages of folliculogenesis?
AMH actions in the primate ovary may be stage-dependent, directly promoting pre-antral follicle growth while inhibiting antral follicle maturation and dominant follicle selection.
AMH is expressed in the adult ovary, particularly in developing follicles. Studies in mice suggest that AMH suppresses pre-antral follicle growth in vitro, and inhibits primordial follicle recruitment and FSH-stimulated antral follicle steroidogenesis.
For in vitro study, secondary follicles were isolated from ovaries of 12 rhesus macaques and cultured for 5 weeks. For in vivo study, intraovarian infusion was conducted on five monkeys for the entire follicular phase during two spontaneous menstrual cycles.
For in vitro study, individual follicles were cultured in a 5% O2 environment, in alpha minimum essential medium supplemented with recombinant human FSH. Follicles were randomly assigned to treatments of recombinant human AMH protein or neutralizing anti-human AMH antibody (AMH-Ab). Follicle survival, growth, steroid production, steroidogenic enzyme expression, and oocyte maturation were assessed. For in vivo study, ovaries were infused with control vehicle or AMH-Ab during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Cycle length, serum steroid levels, and antral follicle growth were evaluated.
AMH exposure during culture weeks 0-3 (pre-antral stage) promoted, while AMH-Ab delayed, antrum formation of growing follicles compared with controls. AMH treatment during culture weeks 3-5 (antral stage) decreased (P &lt; 0.05) estradiol (E2) production, as well as the mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1, by antral follicles relative to controls, whereas AMH-Ab increased (P &lt; 0.05) follicular mRNA levels of the enzyme. Intraovarian infusion of AMH-Ab during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle increased (P &lt; 0.05) the average levels of serum E2 compared with those of the control cycles. Three of the five AMH-Ab-treated ovaries displayed multiple (n = 2-9) medium-to-large (2-8 mm) antral follicles at the mid-cycle E2 peak, whereas only one large (4-7 mm) antral follicle was observed in all monkeys during their control cycles. The average levels of serum progesterone were higher (P &lt; 0.05) during the luteal phase of cycles following the AMH-Ab infusion relative to the vehicle infusion.
The in vitro study of AMH actions on cultured individual macaque follicles was limited to the interval from the secondary to small antral stage. A sequential study design was used for in vivo experiments, which may limit the power of the study.
The current study provides novel information on direct actions and role of AMH during primate follicular development, and selection of a dominant follicle by the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. We hypothesize that AMH acts positively on follicular growth during the pre-antral stage in primates, but negatively impacts antral follicle maturation, which is different from what is reported in the mouse model.

2,3,7,8 Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is an aromatic, long-lived environmental contaminant. While the pathogenesis of TCDD-induced toxicity is poorly understood, it has been shown that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is required. However, the specific transcriptomic changes that lead to toxic outcomes have not yet been identified. We previously identified a panel of 33 genes that respond to TCDD treatment in two TCDD-sensitive rodent species. To identify genes involved in the onset of hepatic toxicity, we explored 25 of these in-depth using liver from two rat strains: the TCDD-resistant Han/Wistar (H/W) and the TCDD-sensitive Long-Evans (L-E). Time course and dose-response analyses of mRNA abundance following TCDD insult indicate that eight genes are similarly regulated in livers of both strains of rat, suggesting that they are not central to the severe L-E-specific TCDD-induced toxicities. The remaining 17 genes exhibited various divergent mRNA abundances between L-E and H/W strains after TCDD treatment. Several genes displayed a biphasic response where the initial response to TCDD treatment was followed by a secondary response, usually of larger magnitude in L-E liver. This secondary response was most often an exaggeration of the original TCDD-induced response. Only cytochrome b5 type A (microsomal) (Cyb5a) had equivalent TCDD sensitivity to the prototypic AHR-responsive cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1), while six genes were less sensitive. Four genes showed an early inter-strain difference that was sustained throughout most of the time course (atypical chemokine receptor 3 (Ackr3), collagen, type XVIII, alpha 1 (Col18a1), Cyb5a and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (Glud1)), and of those genes examined in this study, are most likely to represent genes involved in the pathogenesis of TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity in L-E rats.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is associated with an enhanced risk for liver and cardiovascular diseases and mortality. NAFLD can progress from simple hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the mechanisms predisposing to this progression remain undefined. Notably, hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is a common finding in patients with NASH. Due to a lack of appropriate experimental animal models, it has not been evaluated whether this mitochondrial dysfunction plays a causative role for the development of NASH.
To determine the effect of a well-defined mitochondrial dysfunction on liver physiology at baseline and during dietary challenge, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice were employed. This conplastic inbred strain has been previously reported to exhibit decreased mitochondrial respiration likely linked to a non-synonymous gene variation (nt7778 G/T) of the mitochondrial ATP synthase protein 8 (mt-ATP8).
At baseline conditions, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice displayed hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased ATP production and increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, genes affecting lipid metabolism were differentially expressed, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels were changed in these animals, and various acyl-carnitines were altered, pointing towards an impaired mitochondrial carnitine shuttle. However, over a period of twelve months, no spontaneous hepatic steatosis or inflammation was observed. On the other hand, upon dietary challenge with either a methionine and choline deficient diet or a western-style diet, C57BL/6J-mt(FVB/N) mice developed aggravated steatohepatitis as characterized by lipid accumulation, ballooning of hepatocytes and infiltration of immune cells.
We observed distinct metabolic alterations in mice with a mitochondrial polymorphism associated hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction. However, a second hit, such as dietary stress, was required to cause hepatic steatosis and inflammation. This study suggests a causative role of hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of experimental NASH.
Phthalate exposure impairs testis development and function; however, whether phthalates affect nonreproductive functions is not well understood. To investigate this, C57BL/6J mice were fed 1-500 mg di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) in corn oil, or vehicle only, daily from 4 to 14 days, after which tissues were collected (prepubertal study). Another group was fed 1-500 mg/kg·d DBP from 4 to 21 days and then maintained untreated until 8 weeks for determination of adult consequences of prepubertal exposure. Bones were assessed by microcomputed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and T by RIA. DBP exposure decreased prepubertal femur length, marrow volume, and mean moment of inertia. Adult animals exposed prepubertally to low DBP doses had lower bone mineral content and bone mineral density and less lean tissue mass than vehicle-treated animals. Altered dynamics of the emerging Leydig population were found in 14-day-old animals fed 100-500 mg/kg·d DBP. Adult mice had variable testicular T and serum T and LH concentrations after prepubertal exposure and a dose-dependent reduction in cytochrome p450, family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1. Insulin-like 3 was detected in Sertoli cells of adult mice administered the highest dose of 500 mg/kg·d DBP prepubertally, a finding supported by the induction of insulin-like 3 expression in TM4 cells exposed to 50 μM, but not 5 μM, DBP. We propose that low-dose DBP exposure is detrimental to bone but that normal bone mineral density/bone mineral content after high-dose DBP exposure reflects changes in testicular somatic cells that confer protection to bones. These findings will fuel concerns that low-dose DBP exposure impacts health beyond the reproductive axis.
Phase I enzymes, including cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, and polypeptide 2 (CYP1A2), are involved in the activation of carcinogens to reactive intermediates that are capable of binding covalently to DNA to form DNA adducts, potentially initiating the carcinogenic process. The aim of present study was to investigate the association of CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms and haplotypes with lung cancer risk. A case-control study was carried out on 105 lung cancer patients and 189 controls. To investigate three CYP1A2 polymorphisms: rs2472299, rs2470890, rs11072508 we used a high resolution melting analysis. We found significant allele associations (rs2470890 and rs2422299) with lung cancer risk. We searched for meaningful associations for all variants in the dominant, recessive, and additive genetic models. Genotype associations in the recessive model were of marginal significance for the same single nucleotide polymorphisms. A haplotype analysis included five variants with the frequency higher than 1 %. The haplotype "acc", present with the highest frequency, was associated with increased lung cancer risk (38.7 % vs. 31.5 %; OR 1.38; 95 %CI 0.95-2.01). On the contrary, rare haplotype "gtc" was significantly associated with decreased lung cancer risk in the Slovak population. In conclusion, the present study identified the risk alleles and haploid genotype associations of the CYP1A2 gene in lung cancer.
Known genetic factors explain only a small fraction of genetic variation in colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify risk loci for CRC.
This discovery stage included 8027 cases and 22,577 controls of East-Asian ancestry. Promising variants were evaluated in studies including as many as 11,044 cases and 12,047 controls. Tumor-adjacent normal tissues from 188 patients were analyzed to evaluate correlations of risk variants with expression levels of nearby genes. Potential functionality of risk variants were evaluated using public genomic and epigenomic databases.
We identified 4 loci associated with CRC risk; P values for the most significant variant in each locus ranged from 3.92 × 10(-8) to 1.24 × 10(-12): 6p21.1 (rs4711689), 8q23.3 (rs2450115, rs6469656), 10q24.3 (rs4919687), and 12p13.3 (rs11064437). We also identified 2 risk variants at loci previously associated with CRC: 10q25.2 (rs10506868) and 20q13.3 (rs6061231). These risk variants, conferring an approximate 10%-18% increase in risk per allele, are located either inside or near protein-coding genes that include transcription factor EB (lysosome biogenesis and autophagy), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit H (initiation of translation), cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (steroidogenesis), splA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 2 (proteasome degradation), and ribosomal protein S2 (ribosome biogenesis). Gene expression analyses showed a significant association (P &lt; .05) for rs4711689 with transcription factor EB, rs6469656 with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit H, rs11064437 with splA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 2, and rs6061231 with ribosomal protein S2.
We identified susceptibility loci and genes associated with CRC risk, linking CRC predisposition to steroid hormone, protein synthesis and degradation, and autophagy pathways and providing added insight into the mechanism of CRC pathogenesis.
In children and adolescents treated with risperidone, hyperprolactinemia is a frequent complication that may have clinical repercussions. Several genes have been associated with this occurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of hyperprolactinemia in children and adolescents treated with risperidone, and its associations with clinical and pharmacological data and certain polymorphisms of the following genes: Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C (HTR2C), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6), leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), and scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2).
The study included patients using risperidone (8-20 years old) and healthy subjects not exposed to the medication. Psychopathological symptoms, doses, and duration of treatment with risperidone, sex, skin color, body mass index (BMI), use of other psychotropic drugs, and polymorphisms of DRD2, HTR2C, CYP2D6, LEP, LEPR, MC4R, and SCARB2 genes were evaluated.
There were 120 patients and 197 individuals not exposed to risperidone who were evaluated. Among patients, hyperprolactinemia was found in 79 (65.8%) cases, with no differences regarding sex, skin color, or being in monotherapy with risperidone (26.7% of total patients) or not. The level of prolactin was not correlated, either in case or control groups, with chronological age, bone age, prescribed dose of risperidone, weight-adjusted dose of risperidone, or BMI (p &gt; 0.05), but was negatively correlated with the treatment duration (r = -0.352, p = 0.001 among cases; and r = -0.324, p = 0.039 among controls). There were significant differences in use of risperidone between patients and healthy subjects without the medication in the frequency of the polymorphisms of the DRD2, HTR2C, and LEP genes. Considering both sexes together and also specifically among females, the occurrence of hyperprolactinemia was higher in the presence of the C allele of the rs6318 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the HTR2C gene.
This group of children and adolescents with or without isolated use of risperidone presented with a high frequency of hyperprolactinemia, although asymptomatic, and associated, when considering only females or both sexes together, with being a carrier of the C allele of the rs6318 SNP of the HTR2C gene.
Patients have been described with loss-of-function CYP24A1 (cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) mutations that cause a high ratio of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D], increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and resulting hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. A 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D ratio that can identify patients who are candidates for confirmatory CYP24A1 genetic testing would be valuable. We validated an LC-MS/MS assay for 24,25(OH)2D (D3 and D2) and determined a 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D cutoff to identify candidates for confirmatory genetic testing.
After addition of isotope-labeled internal standard, serum samples were extracted by solid-phase extraction, derivatized with 4-phenyl-1,2,4,-triazoline-3,5-dione, and quantified by LC-MS/MS. We measured 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D in 91 healthy patients and 34 patients with clinically suspected CYP24A1-mediated hypercalcemia.
The limits of detection and quantification were 0.03 (0.2) and 0.1 (0.24) nmol/L, respectively, for 24,25(OH)2D3, and 0.1 (0.23) and 0.5 (1.16) nmol/L for 24,25(OH)2D2. Intra- and interassay imprecision was 4%-15% across the analytical measurement range of 0.1-25 ng/mL (0.2-60 nmol/L). No interference was observed with 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D of 7-35 was observed in healthy patients, whereas in 2 patients with CYP24A1 mutations, 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D was significantly increased (99-467; P &lt; 0.001). A 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D ratio ≥99 identified patients who were candidates for CYP24A1 genetic testing.
Increased 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D supports the diagnosis of reduced CYP24A1 activity due to mutations in CYP24A1. Measurement of 25(OH)D/24,25(OH)2D should be considered a part of the clinical workup in patients with hypercalcemia of otherwise unknown etiology.
microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of their target genes in a sequence-specific manner. Emerging evidence demonstrates that miRNAs are critical regulators of lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein formation and secretion. Dysregulation of miRNAs disrupts gene regulatory network, leading to metabolic syndrome and its related diseases. In this review, we introduced epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of miRNAs expression. We emphasized on several representative miRNAs that are functionally involved into lipid metabolism, including miR-33/33(⁎), miR122, miR27a/b, miR378/378(⁎), miR-34a and miR-21. Understanding the function of miRNAs in lipid homeostasis may provide potential therapeutic strategies for fatty liver disease. 
Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG, OMIM 231300), the most common glaucoma in infancy, is caused by developmental defects in the anterior chamber angle. The 3 implicated genes are cytochrome P450 family I subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1), latent transforming growth factor β-binding protein 2 (LTBP2), and myocilin (MYOC). In this study, we sought to determine CYP1B1 and MYOC sequence variations in a Vietnamese cohort of index cases with PCG and their families.
Thirty Vietnamese subjects with PCG and 120 normal Vietnamese subjects were recruited. PCG was defined by the presence of at least 2 of the following clinical manifestations: increased corneal diameter (&gt;10 mm at birth), corneal edema, Haab's striae, optic disc changes, and absence of other ocular or systemic diseases associated with childhood glaucoma. The coding exons, intron and exon boundaries, and untranslated regions of CYP1B1 and MYOC genes were PCR amplified and subjected to bidirectional sequencing in all subjects.
We identified 2 homozygous and 3 heterozygous CYP1B1 sequence alterations in our study subjects. Among the 5 mutations identified, 2 (p.H279L and p.L283F) were novel mutations, whereas 3 (p.A121_S122insDRPAFA, p.L107V, and p.V320L) had been previously reported in PCG cases. None of these mutations was observed in any of the 120 controls. Haplotypes generated with 6 non-disease-causing intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms detected in CYP1B1 indicated that the most common haplotype in Vietnamese population is similar to that found in Chinese and Japanese. The genotype-phenotype correlation showed no significant difference between mutation and no-mutation groups for quantitative clinical features (presenting intraocular pressure, corneal diameter, number of surgeries performed, the cup-to-disc ratio) as well as for qualitative factors (bilateral cases, phenotype severity, and the prognosis) (P&gt;0.05).
Five out of 30 families with PCG (16.7%) had disease attributable to CYP1B1 alterations suggesting that CYP1B1 is not the major gene causing PCG in Vietnamese unlike in the case of Arab or Romany patients. This percentage is similar to that detected in studies of Japanese and Chinese patients with sporadic PCG. PCG has proven to be an ocular disease of genetic heterogeneity, calling for further studies to identify novel genes causing this disease.
The aim of the study was to clarify 1) the distribution of 6 α-tocopherol (α-Toc)-associated gene expressions in 20 major tissues, including metabolic, reproductive, endocrine, immune, and digestive and absorptive tissues, in relation to α-Toc status and 2) the change in expression patterns of the genes induced when α-Toc was orally administered to Japanese Black (JB) calves. This study examined weaned male JB calves ( = 10), of which 5 calves were orally administered α-Toc for 2 wk (30 IU·kg BW·d; TOC group). The others did not receive the α-Toc supplement and were the control (CONT) group. The 20 tissues and venous blood (serum) were sampled on the final day. In both groups, the mean mRNA expression levels for α-Toc transfer protein, afamin (AFM), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, and tocopherol-associated protein were greatest in the liver ( &lt; 0.05), whereas scavenger receptor class B, Type I (SR-BI) mRNA was greatest in the adrenal gland ( &lt; 0.05). The gene for cytochrome P450 family 4, subfamily F, polypeptide 2 was most highly expressed in the liver, testes, and adrenal gland. The α-Toc content was greatest ( &lt; 0.05) in the testes of the 20 sampled tissues in the CONT group. However, the levels in the testes and jejunum were similar and greater ( &lt; 0.05) than the levels in the other 18 tissues in the TOC group. The mean increase in α-Toc levels after oral α-Toc administration (mean α-Toc content for the TOC group divided by the CONT group content) were greater ( &lt; 0.05) in the jejunum (40.7-fold) and duodenum and liver (26.3- and 23.1-fold) than in the serum (7.8-fold). In the liver, α-Toc administration significantly increased ( &lt; 0.05) the AFM and SR-BI mRNA expression levels. The results show that the liver may play an important role in the regulation of α-Toc disposition, but other peripheral tissues that accumulate large amounts of α-Toc could moderate the local α-Toc status and functions, as inferred from the high expressions of the α-Toc-associated genes in JB calves. 
We aim to study the mechanisms underlying our previous finding that exogenous glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) treatment in a preclinical model of neonatal parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) improves cholestasis.
Neonatal piglets received 17 days of parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy and either saline control (PN/Saline n = 8) or GLP-2 treatment at 11 nmol/kg/d (PN/GLP-2, n = 7). At terminal laparotomy, bile and liver samples were collected. The relative gene expression of enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis, regulation, and transport was measured in liver by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Bile acid composition in bile was determined using tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA.
GLP-2 increased the expression of bile acid export genes: multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2 (MRP2) (P = .002) and 3 (MRP3) (P = .037) over saline control. GLP-2 increased expression of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (P &lt; .001) and CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) (P = .03). GLP-2 treatment was associated with decreased concentrations of taurohyocholic acid and conjugates of toxic lithocholic acid (P &lt; .01). GLP-2 treatment increased the liver bile acid content.
GLP-2 treatment was associated with alterations in the hepatic expression of genes involved in bile acid metabolism. The transcriptomic results indicate the mechanisms at the transcriptional level acting to regulate bile acid synthesis and increase bile acid export. Differences in bile acid profiles further support a beneficial role for GLP-2 therapy in PNALD.
There is evidence that regulation of follicle selection in cattle involves locally produced growth factors. In the present study, we investigated the expression of members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 7 family during follicle deviation. The largest and second largest follicles were recovered during the second day of a synchronised follicle wave and the future dominant and future subordinate follicles were identified based on diameter and cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP19A1) mRNA levels in granulosa cells. Theca cells of the future dominant follicle contained less mRNA encoding FGF7 and FGF10 compared with those from the future subordinate follicle 2.5 days after ovulation, before a significant difference between the diameters of the future dominant and future subordinate follicles could be observed, but FGF22 mRNA levels did not change. Levels of mRNA encoding FGF receptors FGFR1B and FGFR2B in theca and granulosa cells, respectively, were lower in the future dominant follicle compared with the future subordinate follicle. Addition of FGF10 to granulosa cells in vitro significantly decreased oestradiol secretion, as well as CYP19A1, FSH receptor (FSHR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) mRNA abundance, whereas FGF22 had no effect. We conclude that FGF10 and FGFR2B expression is increased in the future subordinate follicle before morphological deviation, which may contribute to follicle selection.
In areas where soils are deficient in Selenium (Se), dietary supplementation of this trace mineral directly to cattle is recommended. Because Se status affects testosterone synthesis and frequency of sperm abnormalities, and the form of Se supplemented to cows affects tissue-specific gene expression, the objective of this study was to determine whether the form of Se consumed by cows during gestation would affect the expression of mRNAs that regulate steroidogenesis and/or spermatogenesis in the neonatal calf testis. Twenty-four predominantly Angus cows were assigned randomly to have individual, ad libitum, access of a mineral mix containing 35 ppm of Se in free-choice vitamin-mineral mixes as either inorganic (ISe), organic (OSe), or a 50/50 mix of ISe and OSe (MIX), starting 4 months prior to breeding and continuing throughout gestation. Thirteen male calves were born over a 3-month period (ISe, n = 5; OSe, n = 4; MIX, n = 4), castrated within 2 days of birth, and extracted testis RNA subjected to transcriptomal analysis by microarray (Affymetrix Bovine 1.0 ST arrays) and targeted gene expression analysis by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) of mRNAs encoding proteins known to affect steroidogenesis and/or spermatogenesis. The form of dam Se affected (P &lt; 0.05) the expression of 853 annotated genes, including 17 mRNAs putatively regulating steroidogenesis and/or spermatogenesis. Targeted RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of mRNA encoding proteins CYP2S1 (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily S, polypeptide 1), HSD17B7 (hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenase 7), SULT1E1 (sulfotransferase family 1E, estrogen preferring, member 1), LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A), CDK5R1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5, regulatory subunit 1), and LEP (leptin) was affected (P &lt; 0.05) by form of Se consumed by dams of developing bull calves, while AKR1C4 (aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C4) and CCND2 (cyclin D2) tended (P &lt; 0.09) to be affected. Our results indicate that form of Se fed to dams during gestation affected the transcriptome of the neonatal calf testis. If these profiles are maintained throughout maturation, then the form of Se fed to dams may impact bull fertility and the development of Se form-dependent mineral mixes that target gestational development of the testis are warranted. 
Are there associations between early time-lapse parameters, expression of candidate embryo viability genes in cumulus cells and embryo quality on Day 5?
Early time-lapse parameters correlate to the expression levels of candidate embryo viability genes in cumulus cells but a combined analysis including both time-lapse and candidate gene expression did not identify significant predictors of embryo quality on Day 5.
Recent evidence suggests that early time-lapse parameters are predictive of blastocyst development. Similarly, a number of candidate genes in cumulus cells have been identified as potential markers of embryo viability. Relationships between time-lapse parameters and candidate gene expression in cumulus cells have not been investigated, and a combined analysis of these markers has not been attempted in relation to embryo quality.
A total of 78 embryos obtained by ICSI from 22 patients were studied by time-lapse and measurement of cumulus cell gene expression of known markers of embryo viability. Time-lapse and cumulus cell gene expression data were assessed in relation to embryo quality on Day 5.
All women, aged 32-40 years, underwent ICSI treatment for male infertility. Embryos with annotatable time to pronuclear breakdown (tPNB), division to two cells (t2C), three cells (t3C), four cells (t4C) and five cells (t5C) were included in the study. Expression levels of 27 candidate genes for embryo viability were measured in 78 associated cumulus cell masses using quantitative real-time PCR.
Cumulus cell expression of 11 candidate genes involved in energy metabolism (ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 70 kDa, V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex, 1, 7.5 kDa (NDUFA1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), phosphofructokinase platelet (PFKP) and solute carrier family 2 member 4 (SLC2A4), mitochondrial biogenesis (DNA directed RNA polymerase, mitochondrial (POLRMT) and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), signalling (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), steroidogenesis (cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP11A1) and cell stress (heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (HSPA5) and peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3)) correlated to time-lapse parameters of the developing embryo, largely for t3C onwards (all P &lt; 0.05). Expression of ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex, subunit E (ATP51), HSPA5, PFKP, PRDX3 and versican (VCAN) and the parameter t4C were also related to embryo quality on Day 5 (all P &lt; 0.05). Ordinal logistic regression, where gene expression and time-lapse parameters were combined, did not identify any significant predictors of embryo quality on Day 5.
Data are from a preliminary study, limited by a small sample size and using more than one ovarian stimulation protocol. A possible limitation is that each follicle was treated as an independent observation, although a considerable fraction of embryos were from the same patient.
Results presented in this study suggest that some of the variation of time-lapse parameters may be related to cumulus cell gene expression and thus the ovarian microenvironment in which the oocyte developed. Although the current study did not identify significant predictors of embryo quality on Day 5, investigation in a larger cohort may determine whether cumulus cell gene expression and time-lapse parameters can be combined to predict embryo quality.

The vitamin A precursor β-carotene (BC) promotes mammalian embryonic development by serving as a source of retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) to the developing tissues. In the Western world, increased consumption of dietary supplements, including vitamin A and BC, is common; however, the consequences of maternal high preformed vitamin A intake on embryonic uptake and metabolism of BC are poorly understood.
This study investigated vitamin A and BC metabolism in developing mouse tissues after a single BC administration to pregnant wild-type (WT) mice fed purified diets with different vitamin A concentrations.
WT dams fed a sufficient vitamin A (VA-S; 4.2 μg of retinol/g of diet), high vitamin A (VA-H; 33 μg of retinol/g of diet), or excess vitamin A (VA-E; 66 μg of retinol/g of diet) diet throughout gestation were intraperitoneally injected with BC or vehicle at 13.5 d postcoitum (dpc). At 14.5 dpc, retinoid and BC concentrations in maternal serum and liver, placenta, and embryo were quantified by HPLC; expressions of genes controlling retinoid and BC homeostasis were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Maternal lipoprotein BC concentrations were analyzed by density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by HPLC.
Intact BC was undetectable only in embryos from VA-E + BC dams. Relative to the VA-S + vehicle group, placentas from VA-S + BC dams showed 39% downregulation of LDL-receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1 ); 35% downregulation of VLDL receptor (Vldlr); 56% reduced mRNA expression of β-carotene 15,15'-oxygenase (Bco1); and 80% upregulation of β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase (Bco2). Placental cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (Cyp26A1) was upregulated 2-fold in the VA-E group compared with the VA-S group, regardless of maternal treatment.
In mice, transfer of intact BC to the embryo is attenuated by high tissue vitamin A concentrations. Maternal vitamin A intake and BC availability activate a placental transcriptional response to protect the embryo from retinoid and carotenoid excess.
Elevations in neuronal cholesterol have been associated with several degenerative diseases. An enhanced excitability and synchronous firing in surviving neurons are among the sequels of neuronal death in these diseases and also in some epileptic syndromes. Here, we attempted to increase neuronal cholesterol levels, using a short hairpin RNA to suppress expression of the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 46, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 gene (CYP46A1). This protein hydroxylates cholesterol and so facilitates transmembrane extrusion. A short hairpin RNA CYP46A1construction coupled to the adeno-associated virus type 5 was injected focally and unilaterally into mouse hippocampus. It was selectively expressed first in neurons of the cornu ammonis (hippocampus) (CA)3a region. Cytoplasmic and membrane cholesterol increased, and the neuronal soma volume increased and then decreased before pyramidal cells died. As CA3a pyramidal cells died, interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) events occurred during exploration and non-rapid eye movement sleep. With time, neuronal death spread to involve pyramidal cells and interneurons of the CA1 region. CA1 neuronal death was correlated with a delayed local expression of phosphorylated tau. Astrocytes were activated throughout the hippocampus and microglial activation was specific to regions of neuronal death. CA1 neuronal death was correlated with distinct aberrant EEG activity. During exploratory behaviour and rapid eye movement sleep, EEG oscillations at 7-10 Hz (theta) could accelerate to 14-21 Hz (beta) waves. They were accompanied by low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations of peak power at ~300 Hz and a range of 250-350 Hz. Although episodes of EEG acceleration were not correlated with changes in exploratory behaviour, they were followed in some animals by structured seizure-like discharges. These data strengthen links between increased cholesterol, neuronal sclerosis and epileptic behaviour.
A number of genetic studies have reported an association between vitamin D related genes such as group-specific component gene (GC), Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1 (CYP2R1) and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase/nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide synthetase 1 (DHCR7/NADSYN1) and serum levels of the active form of Vitamin D, 25 (OH) D among African Americans, Caucasians, and Chinese. Little is known about how genetic variations associate with, or contribute to, 25(OH)D levels in Arabs populations.
Allele frequencies of 18 SNPs derived from CYP2R1, GC, and DHCR7/NADSYN1 genes in 1549 individuals (Arabs, South Asians, and Southeast Asians living in Kuwait) were determined using real time genotyping assays. Serum levels of 25(OH)D were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay.
GC gene polymorphisms (rs17467825, rs3755967, rs2282679, rs7041 and rs2298850) were found to be associated with 25(OH)D serum levels in Arabs and South Asians. Two of the CYP2R1 SNPs (rs10500804 and rs12794714) and one of GC SNPs (rs1155563) were found to be significantly associated with 25(OH)D serum levels only in people of Arab origin. Across all three ethnicities none of the SNPs of DHCR7/NADSYN1 were associated with serum 25(OH)D levels and none of the 18 SNPs were significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D levels in people from South East Asia.
Our data show for the first time significant association between the GC (rs2282679 and rs7041), CYP2R1 (rs10741657) SNPs and 25(OH)D levels. This supports their roles in vitamin D Insufficiency in Arab and South Asian populations respectively. Interestingly, two of the CYP2R1 SNPs (rs10500804 and rs12794714) and one GC SNP (rs1155563) were found to correlate with vitamin D in Arab population exclusively signifying their importance in this population.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce the serious side effect of small intestinal ulcerations (SIUs), but little information is available regarding the consequences to drug metabolism and absorption.
We examined the existence of secondary hepatic inflammation in rats with indomethacin (INM)-induced SIUs and assessed its relationship to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and P-glycoprotein (mdr1a), the major drug-metabolizing factors in the small intestine and the liver.
Gene expression of the CYP family of enzymes and mdr1a was measured with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Vancomycin (VCM), a poorly absorbed drug, was administered intraduodenally to rats with SIUs.
INM induced SIUs predominantly in the lower region of the small intestine with high expression of inflammatory markers. Liver dysfunction was also observed, which suggested a secondary inflammatory response in rats with SIUs. In the liver of rats with SIUs, the expression of CYP2C11, CYP2E1, and CYP3A1 was significantly decreased, and loss of CYP3A protein was observed. Although previous studies have shown a direct effect of INM on CYP3A activity, we could not confirm any change in hepatic CY3A4 expression (major isoform of human CYP3A) in vitro. The plasma VCM concentration was increased in rats with SIUs due to partial absorption from the mucosal injury, but not in normal mucosa.
INM-induced SIUs had a subtle effect on intestinal CYP expression, but had an apparent action on hepatic CYP, which was influenced, at least in part, by the secondary inflammation. Furthermore, drug absorption was increased in rats with SIUs.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a critical regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis in various cell types. Recently, the RA-metabolizing enzyme CYP26A1 (cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) has been shown to have an oncogenic function in breast carcinogenesis. However, the relevance of elevated CYP26A1 expression in human cancers remains to be clarified.
We immunohistochemically examined the expression of CYP26A1 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its precursors, including low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL, respectively), as well as head and neck cancer (HNC). The association between CYP26A1 expression and a number of clinicopathological parameters was also evaluated.
CYP26A1 was not expressed in normal cervical epithelium. CYP26A1 expression was present in LSIL but limited to basal and parabasal cells. HSIL cases exhibited strong nuclear expression of CYP26A1 and mixed cytoplasmic expression patterns with widely distributed expression toward the epithelial surface. Importantly, strong cytoplasmic staining of CYP26A1 was observed in 19 of 50 (38%) patients with cervical SCC. Elevated expression of CYP26A1 was significantly associated with younger age (&lt;50 years) and lymph node involvement (pN). Similarly, CYP26A1 was not expressed in non-neoplastic tissues of the head and neck, but strong cytoplasmic staining of CYP26A1 was observed in 52 of 128 (41%) HNC cases. Such strong CYP26A1 expression was significantly associated with the primary tumor stage of carcinomas (pT) and the pathological tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) stage in HNC.
Our results indicated an elevated CYP26A1 expression in malignant and precancerous dysplastic lesions of the human cervix, which also increased with the progression of cervical squamous neoplasia. In addition, this report is the first to demonstrate the increased expression of CYP26A1 in HNC and its significant correlation with primary tumor growth. These data suggested that CYP26A1 overexpression might contribute to the development and progression of cervical malignancies and squamous neoplasia of the head and neck.
Jerusalem artichoke (JA) has the potential to attenuate lipid disturbances and insulin resistance (IR), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we elucidated the physiological responses and mechanisms of JA intervention with a comprehensive transcriptome analysis. Wistar rats were fed a control diet, a 60 % fructose-enriched diet (FRU), or a FRU with 10 % JA (n 6-7) for 4 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test was carried out on day 21. Liver samples were collected for biochemical and global gene expression analyses (GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array, Affymetrix). Fructose feeding resulted in IR and hepatic TAG accumulation; dietary JA supplementation significantly improved these changes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that the expression of malic enzyme 1 (Me1), associated with fatty acid synthesis; decorin (Dcn), related to fibrosis; and cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 2 (Cyp1a2) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), associated with inflammation, was differentially altered by the FRU, whereas dietary JA supplementation significantly improved the expression of these genes. We established for the first time the molecular mechanisms driving the beneficial effects of JA in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We propose that 10 % JA supplementation may be beneficial for the prevention of the onset of these diseases.
Enzalutamide is a novel antiandrogen with proven efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
To evaluate enzalutamide's effects on cancer and on androgens in blood and bone marrow, and associate these with clinical observations.
In this prospective phase 2 study, 60 patients with bone mCRPC received enzalutamide 160mg orally daily and had transilial bone marrow biopsies before treatment and at 8 wk of treatment.
Androgen signaling components (androgen receptor [AR], AR splice variant 7 (ARV7), v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog [ERG], cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 [CYP17]) and molecules implicated in mCRPC progression (phospho-Met, phospho-Src, glucocorticoid receptor, Ki67) were assessed by immunohistochemistry; testosterone, cortisol, and androstenedione concentrations were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; AR copy number was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Descriptive statistics were applied.
Median time to treatment discontinuation was 22 wk (95% confidence interval, 19.9-29.6). Twenty-two (37%) patients exhibited primary resistance to enzalutamide, discontinuing treatment within 4 mo. Maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% occurred in 27 (45%) and 13 (22%) patients, respectively. Following 8 wk of treatment, bone marrow and circulating testosterone levels increased. Pretreatment tumor nuclear AR overexpression (&gt; 75%) and CYP17 (&gt; 10%) expression were associated with benefit (p = 0.018). AR subcellular localization shift from the nucleus was confirmed in eight paired samples (with PSA decline) of 23 evaluable paired samples. Presence of an ARV7 variant was associated with primary resistance to enzalutamide (p = 0.018). Limited patient numbers warrant further validation.
The observed subcellular shift of AR from the nucleus and increased testosterone concentration provide the first evidence in humans that enzalutamide suppresses AR signaling while inducing an adaptive feedback. Persistent androgen signaling in mCRPC was predictive of benefit and ARV7 was associated with primary resistance.
We report a first bone biopsy study in metastatic prostate cancer in humans that searched for predictors of outcome of enzalutamide therapy. Benefit is linked to a pretreatment androgen-signaling signature.

Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to the overall United States mortality rate, primarily in the form of heart attacks and stroke. Unlike the human disease, which is believed to be multifactorial, pigeon atherosclerosis is due to a single gene autosomal recessive trait. The White Carneau (WC-As) strain develops atherosclerotic plaques without the presence of known environmental risk factors such as diet and classic predictors such as blood pressure or blood cholesterol levels. With similar parameters, the Show Racer (SR-Ar) is resistant to plaque development. Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) raising cellular sensitivity to insulin. The effect of rosiglitazone was evaluated in aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) from these 2 pigeon breeds. Primary SMC cultures were prepared from WC-As and SR-Ar squabs. Cell monolayers, which achieved confluence in 7 d, were treated with 0 or 4 µM rosiglitazone for 24 h. Cellular lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining. Control WC-As cells had significantly higher vacuole scores and lipid content than did the SR-Ar control cells. Rosiglitazone treatment decreased WC-As lipid vacuoles significantly compared with the control cells. On the other hand, lipid vacuoles in the treated and untreated SR-Ar cells did not differ significantly. The effect of rosiglitazone on WC-As SMC gene expression was compared with control SMC using representational difference analysis. Significant transcript increases were found for caveolin and RNA binding motif in the control cells compared with the rosiglitazone-treated cells as well as cytochrome p450 family 17 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP171A) in the rosiglitazone-treated cells compared with the control cells. Although rosiglitazone was selected for these experiments because of its role as a PPARγ agonist, it appears that the drug also tempers c-myc expression, as genes related to this second transcription factor were differentially expressed. Both PPARγ and c-myc appear to affect WC-As SMC gene expression, which may relate to disease development, progression, or both. 
The antidiabetic drugs glibenclamide, repaglinide, and nateglinide are well-known substrates for hepatic uptake transporters of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family and metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C subfamily. The systemic exposure of these drugs varies substantially among individuals, impacted by genetic polymorphisms of transporters and metabolizing enzymes as well as drug-drug interactions. The use of the conventional in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) method was found to underestimate their hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint,all); the clinically observed CLint,all values were ≥10-fold higher than the predicted values from in vitro data. In order to improve the accuracy in predicting CLint,all of these drugs, the following modifications were implemented; i) the extended clearance concept was applied during IVIVE processes, ii) albumin was added to metabolic assays using human liver microsomes (to minimize the impact of intrinsic inhibitors on kinetic parameters for CYP2C-mediated metabolism) and to hepatic uptake assays (to accommodate the enhanced hepatic uptake observed with albumin-bound drugs), and iii) differing rates of efflux and influx via diffusion were used. The IVIVE method with these modifications yielded the predicted CLint,all values from in vitro data in closer agreement with the CLint,all values observed in vivo; the fold differences between the predicted and observed CLint,all values reduced from 13-15 to 5.9-6.7. Our current approach offers an improvement in the prediction of CLint,all and further investigations are warranted to enhance the prediction accuracy of IVIVE.
Bile acid biosynthesis is strictly regulated under physiological conditions. The expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 is induced when bile acids bind to the farnesoid X receptor in the intestinal epithelium. Fibroblast growth factor 19 is then transported by the portal flow, causing transcriptional inhibition of cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these signaling pathways in hepatocytes under chronic cholestasis remain unclear. We investigated the regulation of these signaling pathways in patients with biliary atresia (BA).
We analyzed the regulation of molecules in these signaling pathways using liver and serum samples from eight BA children and four non-cholestatic disease controls.
CYP7A1 mRNA expression was not inhibited in BA microdissected hepatocyte-enriched tissue (HET) despite high serum bile acid concentrations. The FGF19 protein was synthesized in BA HET, and its serum concentration was elevated. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 was phosphorylated in BA livers. However, ERK phosphorylation was significantly reduced. We examined SPRY2 expression to determine how the ERK pathway was inactivated downstream of the FGF receptor; the expression was significantly increased in BA HET.
This is the first study to measure the CYP7A1 mRNA levels in human BA HET. Fibroblast growth factor 19 was increased in BA hepatocytes. By focusing on its regulation in hepatocytes, we showed that the FGF19 pathway did not suppress bile acid synthesis, probably due to an altered mechanism involving upregulated SPRY2 in BA patients.
The sturgeon family includes many species that are lucrative for commercial caviar production, some of which face critical conservation problems. The purpose of this study was to identify genes involved in gonadal sex differentiation in sturgeons, contributing to our understanding of the biological cycle of this valuable species. A high-quality de novo Siberian sturgeon gonadal transcriptome was built for this study using gonadal samples from undifferentiated fish at 3, 5, and 6 months of age; recently sex-differentiated fish at 9 months of age; and immature males and females at 14-17 months of age. Undifferentiated fish were sexed after validation of forkhead box L2 (foxl2) and cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, and polypeptide 1a (cyp19a1a) as sex markers, and the transcriptomes of the 3-month-old undifferentiated fish, 5-6-month-old future females, and 5-6-month-old putative males were compared. The ovarian program was associated with strong activation of genes involved in estrogen synthesis (cyp19a1, foxl2, and estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 1), stem-cell niche building and regulation, and sex-specific nerve cell development. The genes related to the stem-cell niche were: (1) the family of iroquois-class homeodomain proteins 3, 4, and 5 (irx3, irx4, irx5-1, irx5-2, and irx5-3), which are essential for somatic-germ cell interaction; (2) extracellular matrix remodeling genes, such as collagen type XXVIII alpha 1 chain and collagen type II alpha 1 chain, matrix metalloproteinases 24-1 and 24-2, and NADPH oxidase organizer 1, which, along with the somatic cells, provide architectural support for the stem-cell niche; and (3) mitogenic factors, such as lim homeobox 2, amphiregulin, G2/M phase-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of ras 2, which are up regulated in conjunction with the anti-apoptotic gene G2/M phase-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase suggesting a potential involvement in regulating the number of germ cells. Genes related to sex-specific nerve cell developments were: the neurofilament medium polypeptides, the gene coding for serotonin receptor 7, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7; neurotensin, isoform CRA-a, the neuron-specific transmembrane protein Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor; and insulinoma-associated protein 1. The putative testicular program was poorly characterized by elements of the immune response. The classic markers of maleness were not specifically activated, indicating that testicular differentiation occurs at a later stage. In sum, the ovarian program, but not the testicular program, is in place by 5-6 months of age in the Siberian sturgeon. The female program is characterized by estrogen-related genes with well-established roles in gonadal differentiation, but also by several genes with no previously-described function in the ovarian development of fish. These newly-reported genes are involved in stem-cell niche building and regulation as well as sex-specific nerve development.
Early onset preeclampsia (PPE) contributes to life-threatening maternal complications and fetal demise. Pharmacogenomics is a precision medicine, and metabolizing enzymes responsive to antihypertensive remains understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of polymorphisms of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6 (CYP2D6) and cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) with PPE and the relationship among CYP2D6, CYP2C9 polymorphisms and response to labetalol therapy.
Totally 105 gravidas diagnosed with PPE (case) and 103 healthy gravidas (control) were recruited between August 2013 and July 2016. Labetalol was given to control blood pressures (BP) with PPE. If labetalol administration alone did not exceed the mean dose and effectively controlled the BP, it would be considered to be valid (n = 75). Genotype and allele frequencies of CYP2C9 gene (rs1057910 and rs4918758) and CYP2D6 gene (rs1065852, rs28371725, rs35742686, and rs3892097) were analyzed by TaqMan PCR. Differences in the genotype and allele frequencies were compared between case-control groups, and the responsive and nonresponsive to labetalol in PPE.
Out of six variants, only CC and CT genotypes of the CYP2D6 variants (rs28371725) in PPE were significantly higher than those in the control group [18.1% (19/105) vs 14.6% (15/103); 56.2% (59/105) vs 42.7% (44/103); χ2 = 6.707]. However, there were no differences in maternal age, diastolic pressure, BMI, BW, serum triglyceride, and creatinine were observed among women with CC, CT, or TT genotype of CYP2D6 gene rs28371725 in the experimental group (all P &gt; 0.05). Compared with the gravidas with CT or TT genotype of CYP2D6 gene rs28371725, those with CC genotype had longer gestational age [(32.5 ± 2.1) vs (29.5 ± 1.8) and (29.8 ± 2.2) weeks] and higher plasma albumin [(27.2 ± 9.3) vs (20.3 ± 10.4) and (22.5 ± 7.4) g/L], but lower systolic pressure and 24 h urine protein (LSD test, all P &lt; 0.05). The G allele frequency in CYP2D6 gene rs1065852 nonresponsive to labetalol group was higher than that in responsive labetalol group [93.3% (56/60) vs 76.0% (114/150), χ2 = 8.351, P = 0.004].
The polymorphism of CYP2D6 gene rs28371725 may be associated with PPE, and the allele of G in CYP2D6 gene rs1065852 may be associated with the efficacy of labetalol in treatment of PPE.
The anti-hypercholesterolemic effect of berbamine (BBM) isolated from Rhizoma Coptidis (RC) was investigated in hypercholesterolemic zebrafish model induced by high-cholesterol (HC) diet. Zebrafish embryo assay revealed no significant difference in morphology and cell death with the treatment of BBM less than 20 μg/mL. In zebrafish larvae, the fluorescently labeled cholesterol in caudal artery was reduced dose-dependently after BBM treatment. For adult zebrafish, administration of 0.2% BBM exhibited a significant decrease in plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels by 37%, 38% and 28%, respectively, along with a fall in lipid content in liver. Further investigation suggested that the mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in liver were down-regulated and the transcription levels of liver gene low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and cytochrome P450 polypeptide 1a of subfamily A of family 7 (CYP7A1a) were significantly up-regulated with BBM treatment. Histological study showed that BBM can alleviate hepatic steatosis induced by HC diet. These data suggested that BBM has anti-hypercholesterolemic and hepatoprotective effects. The mechanism probably related to the up-regulation of cholesterol transport and bile acid synthesis as well as inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and lipoprotein assembly or secretion.
Blood α-tocopherol (α-Toc) concentrations decline gradually throughout the prepartum period, reaching the nadir after calving in dairy cows. The 6 α-Toc-related molecules [α-Toc transfer protein (TTPA); afamin; scavenger receptor class B, Type I; ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; tocopherol-associated protein (SEC14L2); and cytochrome P450 family 4, subfamily F, polypeptide 2 (CYP4F2)] are expressed in liver and other peripheral tissues. These molecules could regulate α-Toc transport, blood concentrations, and metabolism of α-Toc. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the expression of α-Toc-related genes in liver and mammary gland tissues of dairy cows around calving, which have remained elusive until now. In experiment (Exp.) 1, 28 multiparous Holstein cows were used (from -5 to 6 wk relative to parturition) to monitor the changes in dietary α-Toc intake, blood concentrations of α-Toc, and lipoproteins; in Exp. 2, 7 peripartum Holstein cows were used (from -4 to 4 wk relative to parturition) for liver tissue biopsy; and in Exp. 3, 10 peripartum Holstein cows were used (from -8 to 6 wk relative to parturition) to carry out the mammary gland tissue biopsy and milk sampling. In Exp. 1, the serum α-Toc concentrations declined gradually with decreasing amount of α-Toc intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein concentrations toward calving time. However, in the early lactation period after calving, serum α-Toc concentrations remained at a lower concentration despite the recovery of α-Toc intake and plasma high-density lipoprotein concentrations. In Exp. 2, just after calving, the TTPA, SEC14L2, afamin, and albumin mRNA expression levels in the liver were temporarily downregulated, and the hepatic mRNA levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced unfolded protein response markers and acute-phase response marker increased at calving. In Exp. 3, the concentrations of α-Toc in colostrum were greater than those in precolostrum (samples were collected at wk -1 relative to parturition) and mature milk. The expression of TTPA, SEC14L2, and CYP4F2 mRNA in bovine mammary gland tissue was detected. However, TTPA and SEC14L2 mRNA expressions showed the opposite trends: the expression levels of TTPA mRNA peaked whereas SEC14L2 mRNA reached a nadir at calving. These results indicate that the expression of α-Toc-related genes involved in specific α-Toc transfer and metabolism in the liver and mammary gland are altered during calving. Moreover, these changes might be associated with the maintenance of lower serum α-Toc concentrations after calving.
To investigate the expression of androgen receptor (AR) and its correlation with disease status and survival outcome in uterine leiomyosarcoma with other hormone receptors.
The medical records and paraffin blocks of 42 patients were reviewed. The immunohistochemical expression of AR, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), and cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP19A1) were assessed using tissue microarray.
In total, AR expression was observed in 11 patients (26.2%). International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and AR were independent factors for disease-free survival (DFS) in multivariate regression analysis (odds ratio [OR]=5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.2-28.4 and OR=0.2; 95% CI=0.05-0.90; p=0.029 and 0.032, respectively). There were no deaths in the AR expression group, whereas the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 54.8% in the no expression group (p=0.014). Co-expression of ER and/or PR with AR was associated with significantly better 5-year DFS and OS than those with negative AR (72.7% vs. 28.6% and 100% vs. 64.3%; p=0.020 and 0.036, respectively). AR may be an independent prognostic marker regardless of ER/PR.
AR can be a potential prognostic biomarker in uterine leiomyosarcoma.
To investigate the mechanism implicated in the effect of an insoluble fiber (obtained from carob pod) rich in polyphenols (IFCP) in lipid metabolism in the liver.
Male New Zealand rabbits were fed with the following diets for 8 weeks: control diet (CT group), dyslipidemic diet supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol + 14% coconut oil (DL group) and dyslipidemic diet containing 0.5% cholesterol + 14% coconut oil plus 3% IFCP (DL + IFCP group).
Dyslipidemic diet with IFCP was able to reduce development of mixed dyslipidemia, liver relative weight and collagen I protein expression compared to DL rabbits. Analyses of the main enzymes implicated in cholesterol and triglycerides metabolism revealed that IFCP increased hepatic concentration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) and cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, polypeptide 1C (CYP7A1) (82.34, 114.42%, respectively) as well as protein expression of LDL receptor (42.48%) in DL rabbits. Importantly, IFCP also increased hepatic lipase (HL) levels (91.43%) and decreased glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1C (SREBP1c) liver expression levels (20.38 and 41.20%, respectively). Finally, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1α) hepatic expression increased in DL + IFCP group compared with DL (159.81 and 48.00%, respectively).
These findings show that IFCP is able to abrogate the deleterious effects of hepatic dyslipidemia by modulating SIRT1 and PGC-1α pathways.
Adaptive thermogenesis is an energy-demanding process that is mediated by cold-activated beige and brown adipocytes, and it entails increased uptake of carbohydrates, as well as lipoprotein-derived triglycerides and cholesterol, into these thermogenic cells. Here we report that cold exposure in mice triggers a metabolic program that orchestrates lipoprotein processing in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids via the alternative synthesis pathway. This process is dependent on hepatic induction of cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily b, polypeptide 1 (CYP7B1) and results in increased plasma levels, as well as fecal excretion, of bile acids that is accompanied by distinct changes in gut microbiota and increased heat production. Genetic and pharmacological interventions that targeted the synthesis and biliary excretion of bile acids prevented the rise in fecal bile acid excretion, changed the bacterial composition of the gut and modulated thermogenic responses. These results identify bile acids as important metabolic effectors under conditions of sustained BAT activation and highlight the relevance of cholesterol metabolism by the host for diet-induced changes of the gut microbiota and energy metabolism.
The association between the glutathione S-transferase polymorphisms and the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after liver transplant was studied.
Peripheral blood samples were collected from 106 liver transplant patients divided into 2 groups: 52 with new-onset diabetes mellitus and 54 without new-onset diabetes mellitus; 169 healthy individuals with no clinical evidence of diabetes mellitus were selected as a control group. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction technique was used for genotyping GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, using the cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) gene as an internal control. The genotype of GSTP1 was determined using the restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction technique.
The frequency of both GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes was not significantly different in liver transplant patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus compared with the control group (P = .11 for GSTM1; P = .71 for GSTT1). Also, there was no statistically significant association between the frequency of the GSTP1 genotypes in the liver transplant patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus compared with controls. Neither GSTM1 nor GSTT1 null genotypes were associated with the risk of developing new-onset diabetes mellitus (P = .22 for GSTM1; P = .56 for GSTT1). However, the frequency of the heterozygous mutation (AG) in the A313G GSTP1 polymorphism in patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus was significantly higher than in patients without new-onset diabetes mellitus (55.8% vs 7.4%; P = .00). Thus, the risk of developing new-onset diabetes mellitus was significantly higher in patients presenting with heterozygous GSTP1 genotypes (odds ratio = 15.76; 95% confidence interval = 4.53-60.28; P = .00).
The GSTP1 AG genotype was associated with an increased susceptibility to the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after liver transplant.
25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] has recently been found to be an active hormone. Its biological actions are demonstrated in various cell types. 25(OH)D3 deficiency results in failure in bone formation and skeletal deformation. Here, we investigated the effect of 25(OH)D3 on osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We also studied the effect of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25-(OH)2D3], a metabolite of 25(OH)D3. One of the vitamin D responsive genes, 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1) mRNA expression is up-regulated by 25(OH)D3 at 250-500 nM and by 1α,25-(OH)2D3 at 1-10 nM. 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25-(OH)2D3 at a time-dependent manner alter cell morphology towards osteoblast-associated characteristics. The osteogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin), and bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (osteocalcin) are increased by 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25-(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, mineralisation is significantly increased by 25(OH)D3 but not by 1α,25-(OH)2D3. Moreover, we found that hMSCs express very low level of 25(OH)D3-1α-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily B member 1), and there is no detectable 1α,25-(OH)2D3 product. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that 25(OH)D3 at 250-500 nM can induce osteogenic differentiation and that 25(OH)D3 has great potential for cell-based bone tissue engineering.
Aberrant promoter DNA methylation is a major mechanism of leukemogenesis in hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the association between promoter methylation with chemotherapeutic outcomes remains unknown. In the present study, bone marrow samples were collected prior to and following chemotherapy in 30 AML patients. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction technology was used to examine the promoter methylation status of adenomatous polyposis col 2 (APC2) and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1). The results revealed no change in the methylation status of the APC2 promoter in patients following various chemotherapy regimens. However, the methylation status of the CYP1B1 promoter changed in response to 6 different chemotherapy regimens. AML patients of the M3 subtype displayed an induction of the CYP1B1 promoter methylation levels more frequently (57.1%) than patients affected by the other subtypes (M1: 33.3%; M2: 12.5%; M4: 16.7%; M5: 0% and M6: 0%). In addition, a higher frequency of male patients (4/13) exhibited modulation of the CYP1B1 promoter methylation status compared with female patients (3/17). Furthermore, of five AML patients with a poor prognosis, two exhibited changes leading to CYP1B1 hypomethylation and two leading to CYP1B1 hypermethylation. By contrast, three other patients exhibited hypermethylation changes along with remission. This may be explained by the different chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients or by other unknown factors. The present study revealed that CYP1B1 promoter methylation was induced during chemotherapy, whereas the APC2 promoter remained hemimethylated. Furthermore, the changes in CYP1B1 methylation were dependent on the AML subtypes and the gender of the patients.
Skin fibroblasts were obtained from a 47-year-old hereditary spastic paraplegia patient carrying a homozygous mutation Y275X in CYP7B1 (Cytochrome P450, Family 7, Subfamily B, Polypeptide 1), responsible for causing hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated by transfection with episomal plasmids carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF4, hL-MYC and hLIN28. The generated line iPS-SPG5-Y275X was transgene-free, retained the specific mutation with no additional genomic aberrations, expressed pluripotency markers and was able to differentiate into cells of all germ layers in vitro. The generated iPS-SPG5-Y275X line may be a useful resource for disease modelling of SPG5.

This study was performed to detect the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP24A1) in 24 end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and 24 healthy controls.
In this study, 24 ESRD patients and 24 healthy controls were included.
In our study, the levels of VDR in patients with ESRD were reduced when compared with those from healthy controls (5.20±0.32 vs 8.59±1.03; P&lt;0.01). However, the levels of CYP24A1 in ESRD patients were increased than those from healthy controls (50.18±21 vs 7.78±1.31; P&lt;0.01). Correlation analysis showed that VDR levels were negatively correlated with CYP24A1 (r=-0.723; P&lt;0.01).
VDR levels were reduced and CYP24A1 levels were increased in patients with ESRD, and VDR levels were negatively correlated with CYP24A1.
BACKGROUND The aim of the present study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the once-daily tacrolimus formulation (QD form) in relation to polymorphisms of the donor cytochrome P450 family 3 sub-family A polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5) gene and recipient adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) gene. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 80 consecutive living-donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients were started on the QD form of tacrolimus (day 1), and 60 patients were completely followed for 7 days early after liver transplantation in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics. RESULTS The concentration/dose (C/D) ratio in recipients with the donor CYP3A5 *1 allele was significantly lower throughout the observation period compared with those with the CYP3A5 genotype *3/*3 (p&lt;0.001), while no effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 was observed. The administered doses required to achieve the target trough level were significantly higher on day 7 than on day 1 among all groups, regardless of the differences in the SNPs, especially among those with donor CYP3A5 *1 allele. The tacrolimus concentration was kept within the targeted level all through the study regardless of SNPs. CONCLUSIONS The donor CYP3A5 *1 allele correlated with the lower C/D ratio after administration of the QD form, and higher doses of QD-form tacrolimus and careful monitoring for the trough level should be considered, especially in recipients with the donor CYP3A5 *1 allele. 
Prolonged high intakes of dietary selenium have been shown to induce gestational diabetes in rats and hyperinsulinemia in pigs.
Two experiments were conducted to explore metabolic and molecular mechanisms for the diabetogenic potential of high dietary selenium intakes in pigs.
In Expt. 1, 16 Yorkshire-Landrace-Hampshire crossbred pigs (3 wk old, body weight = 7.5 ± 0.81 kg, 50% males and 50% females) were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 0.3 or 1.0 mg Se/kg (as selenium-enriched yeast for 6 wk). In Expt. 2, 12 pigs of the same crossbreed (6 wk old, body weight = 16.0 ± 1.8 kg) were fed a similar basal diet supplemented with 0.3 or 3.0 mg Se/kg for 11 wk. Biochemical and gene and protein expression profiles of lipid and protein metabolism and selenoproteins in plasma, liver, muscle, and adipose tissues were analyzed.
In Expt. 1, the 1-mg-Se/kg diet did not affect body weight or plasma concentrations of glucose and nonesterified fatty acids. In Expt. 2, the 3-mg-Se/kg diet, compared with the 0.3-mg-Se/kg diet, increased (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations of plasma insulin (0.2 compared with 0.4 ng/mL), liver and adipose lipids (41% to 2.4-fold), and liver and muscle protein (10-14%). In liver, the 3-mg-Se/kg diet upregulated (P &lt; 0.05) the expression, activity, or both of key factors related to gluconeogenesis [phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK); 13%], lipogenesis [sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FASN); 46-90%], protein synthesis [insulin receptor (INSR), P70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (P70), and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (P-S6); 88-105%], energy metabolism [AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); up to 2.8-fold], and selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3; 1.4-fold) and suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) mRNA levels of lipolysis gene cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP7A1; 88%) and selenoprotein gene selenoprotein W1 (SEPW1; 46%). In muscle, the 3-mg-Se/kg diet exerted no effect on the lipid profiles but enhanced (P &lt; 0.05) expression of P-S6 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; 42-176%; protein synthesis); selenoprotein P (SELP; 40-fold); and tumor suppressor protein 53 (P53) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG; 52-58%; lipogenesis) and suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) expression of INSR (59%; insulin signaling); selenoprotein S (SELS); deiodinases, iodothyronine, type I (DIO1); and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1; 50%; selenoproteins); and ACC1 and FASN (35-51%; lipogenesis).
Our research showed novel roles, to our best knowledge, and mechanisms of high selenium intakes in regulating the metabolism of protein, along with that of lipid, in a tissue-specific fashion in pigs.
In men, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) acts on the seminiferous tubules and enhances spermatogenesis. Recently, a candidate locus (rs2414095) for FSH levels was identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Chinese men. The rs2414095 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is found on the third intron of the cytochrome P450, family 19, subfamily A, peptide 1 (CYP19A1) gene encoding an aromatase. In the present study, we performed a replication study in 1687 Japanese men (901 from cohort 1 and 786 from cohort 2) to assess whether this SNP is associated with circulating FSH levels. Furthermore, we investigated whether the rs2414095 SNP is correlated with semen quality traits in 2015 Japanese men (1224 from cohort 1 and 791 from cohort 2). The rs2414095 SNP was significantly associated with circulating FSH levels (βSTD=0.15, P=9.7 × 10-5), sperm concentration (βSTD=0.073, P=0.032) and total sperm number (TSN) (βSTD=0.074, P=0.027) in a combined analysis of the two Japanese male cohorts. We successfully replicated, in Japanese men, the results of the previous GWAS for the rs2414095 SNP in Chinese men, and found that the rs2414095 SNP was related with sperm production.
MicroRNA-17 (miRNA-17/miR‑17) expression has been confirmed to be significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues than in normal tissues. However, its exact role in colorectal cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that miR-17 not only promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but also promoted the formation of a stem cell-like population in colon cancer DLD1 cells. We also wished to determine the role of cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP7B1) in CRC. miR-17 was overexpressed using a recombinant plasmid and CYP7B1 was silenced by transfection with shRNA. Western blot analysis was used to determine protein expression in the DLD1 cells and in tumor tissues obtained from patients with colon cancer. Our results revealed that miR‑17 overexpression led to the degradation of CYP7B1 mRNA expression in DLD1 cells. In addition, we found that the silencing of CYB7B1 promoted EMT and the formation of a stem cell-like population in the cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate that miR‑17 induces EMT consistent with the cancer stem cell phenotype by regulating CYP7B1 expression in colon cancer. 
Insulin inhibits transcription of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), a key gene in bile acid synthesis, and the hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) site in the promoter was identified as a negative insulin response sequence. Using a fasting/feeding protocol in mice and insulin treatment in HepG2 cells, we explored the inhibition mechanisms. Expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), an insulin-induced lipogenic factor, inversely correlated with Cyp7a1 expression in mouse liver. Interaction of HNF-4 with its coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), was observed in livers of fasted mice and was reduced after feeding. Conversely, HNF-4 interaction with SREBP-1c was increased after feeding. In vitro studies suggested that SREBP-1c competed with PGC-1alpha for direct interaction with the AF2 domain of HNF-4. Reporter assays showed that SREBP-1c, but not of a SREBP-1c mutant lacking the HNF-4 interacting domain, inhibited HNF-4/PGC-1alpha transactivation of Cyp7a1. SREBP-1c also inhibited PGC-1alpha-coactivation of estrogen receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, pregnane X receptor, and farnesoid X receptor, implying inhibition of HNF-4 by SREBP-1c could extend to other nuclear receptors. In chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, HNF-4 binding to the promoter was not altered, but PGC-1alpha was dissociated, SREBP-1c and histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) were recruited, and acetylation of histone H3 was decreased upon feeding. Adenovirus-mediated expression of a SREBP-1c dominant-negative mutant, which blocks the interaction of SREBP-1c and HNF-4, partially but significantly reversed the inhibition of Cyp7a1 after feeding. Our data show that SREBP-1c functions as a non-DNA-binding inhibitor and mediates, in part, suppression of Cyp7a1 by blocking functional interaction of HNF-4 and PGC-1alpha. This mechanism may be relevant to known repression of many other HNF-4 target genes upon feeding.
The transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has recently been implicated in the control of hepatic triglyceride production. Activation of FXR may ameliorate hypertriglyceridemia, a cardinal feature of the metabolic syndrome. Because hamsters share many characteristic features of human lipid metabolism, we used a high-fructose-fed hamster model to study the impact of FXR activation with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on plasma lipoprotein metabolism. Male Syrian hamsters fed a diet containing 60% kcal from fructose for 2 wk developed hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (+120 and +60%, P = 0.005 and 0.0004 vs. controls) due to increased hepatic lipoprotein production. This could be largely attributed to enhanced hepatic de novo lipogenesis, as indicated by increased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, and steaoryl-CoA desaturase-1. Lipoprotein analysis demonstrated that the increase in plasma triglycerides occurred in the VLDL density range, whereas increases in VLDL, IDL/LDL, and HDL cholesterol accounted for the elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Addition of 0.1% CDCA to the high-fructose diet decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and consequently triglyceride production and prevented the increases in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol (-40 and -18%, P = 0.03 and 0.03 vs. high fructose-fed animals). CDCA-treated animals had lower VLDL triglycerides and decreased VLDL and IDL/LDL cholesterol plasma concentrations. These data demonstrate that activation of FXR with CDCA effectively lowers plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, mainly by decreasing de novo lipogenesis and hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Our studies identify activators of FXR as promising new tools in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemic states, including the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes.
The purpose of this research was to determine how dietary bile acids repress hepatic expression of paraoxonase 1 (PON1).
C57BL/6 mice and C3H/HeJ mice, having different susceptibilities to atherosclerosis, were fed a chow diet and an atherogenic diet containing taurocholate. Compared with the more atherosclerosis-susceptible C57BL/6 mice, C3H/HeJ mice display resistance to dietary bile acid repression of hepatic PON1 mRNA and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whereas knockout of toll receptor 4 did not affect response to taurocholate, deletion of either FXR or FGFR4 blocked taurocholate repression of PON1 and CYP7A1. FGF19, an activator of FGFR4 expressed in human ileum, decreased expression of both PON1 and CYP7A1 expression by human hepatoma cells. In all of the mice studied, dietary taurocholate increased ileal expression of FGF15, a FXR-inducible murine homologue of human FGF19.
Hepatic PON1 and CYP7A1 mRNA expression is repressed by bile acids via FXR-mediated induction of FGF15. Thus, the inability of C3H/HeJ mice to display taurocholate repression of PON1 and CYP7A1 mRNAs was not because of a lack of induction of FGF15 but rather signaling events distal to FGF15-FGFR4 association.
The liver and intestine play crucial roles in maintaining bile acid homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signals from intestine to liver to repress the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the classical bile acid synthetic pathway. FGF15 expression is stimulated in the small intestine by the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR and represses Cyp7a1 in liver through a mechanism that involves FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the orphan nuclear receptor SHP. Mice lacking FGF15 have increased hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA and protein levels and corresponding increases in CYP7A1 enzyme activity and fecal bile acid excretion. These studies define FGF15 and FGFR4 as components of a gut-liver signaling pathway that synergizes with SHP to regulate bile acid synthesis.
Drugs and bile acids are taken up into hepatocytes by specialized transport proteins localized at the basolateral membrane, e.g., organic anion transporting polypeptides . Following intracellular metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, drug metabolites are excreted into bile or urine via ATP-dependent multidrug resistance proteins (MDR1 and MRPs). Bile acids are excreted mainly via the bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11). The genes coding for drug and bile acid transporters and CYP enzymes are regulated by a complex network of transcriptional cascades, notably by the ligand-activated nuclear receptors FXR, PXR, and CAR and by the ligand-independent nuclear receptor HNF-4alpha. The bile acid synthesizing enzymes CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and CYP27A1 are subject to negative feedback regulation by bile acids, which is partly mediated through the transcriptional repressor SHP. The role of transcriptional cofactors, such as SRC-1 and PGC-1, in mediating the gene-specific effects of individual nuclear receptors is becoming increasingly evident.
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) deficiency, is associated with markedly reduced chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the most powerful activating ligand for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). We investigated the effects of reduced CDCA on FXR target genes in humans. Liver specimens from an untreated CTX patient and 10 control subjects were studied. In the patient, hepatic CDCA concentration was markedly reduced but the bile alcohol level exceeded CDCA levels in control subjects (73.5 vs. 37.8 +/- 6.2 nmol/g liver). Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) were upregulated 84- and 8-fold, respectively. However, small heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump were normally expressed. Marked CYP7A1 induction with normal SHP expression was not explained by the regulation of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) or pregnane X receptor. However, another nuclear receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), was induced 2.9-fold in CTX, which was associated with enhanced mRNA levels of HNF4alpha target genes, CYP7A1, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one 12alpha-hydroxylase, CYP27A1, and NTCP. In conclusion, the coordinate regulation of FXR target genes was lost in CTX. The mechanism of the disruption may be explained by a normally stimulated FXR pathway attributable to markedly increased bile alcohols with activation of HNF4alpha caused by reduced bile acids in CTX liver.
Glucocorticoids exert their metabolic effect via their intracellular receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In a yeast two-hybrid screening, we found the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), an orphan nuclear receptor that plays important roles in glucose, cholesterol, and xenobiotic metabolism, as a partner of GR. In an in vitro glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay, COUP-TFII interacted via its DNA-binding domain with the hinge regions of both GRalpha and its splicing variant GRbeta, whereas COUP-TFII formed a complex with GRalpha, but not with GRbeta, in an in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation and a regular immunoprecipitation assay. Accordingly, GRalpha, but not GRbeta, enhanced COUP-TFII-induced transactivation of the simple COUP-TFII-responsive 7alpha-hydroxylase promoter through the transcriptional activity of its activation function-1 domain, whereas COUP-TFII repressed GRalpha-induced transactivation of the glucocorticoid-responsive promoter by attracting the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors. Importantly, mutual protein-protein interaction of GRalpha and COUP-TFII was necessary for glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of the promoter activity and the endogenous mRNA expression of the COUP-TFII-responsive phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of hepatic gluconeogenesis. We suggest that COUP-TFII may participate in some of the metabolic effects of glucocorticoids through direct interactions with GRalpha. These interactions influence the transcription of both COUP-TFII- and GRalpha-responsive target genes, seem to be promoter specific, and can be in either a positive or negative direction.
Fibrate treatment induces adverse changes in biliary-lipid and bile-acid composition. Since the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes are still unclear, we have investigated the effect of fibrate treatment on key factors involved in bile-acid synthesis, biliary-lipid secretion and cholesterol metabolism in gallstone patients.
Patients with uncomplicated gallstones and a serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dl were randomly assigned to open-label treatment with bezafibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, or placebo for 8 weeks before elective cholecystectomy. A liver specimen was obtained at operation, and the mRNA relative levels for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), ATP-binding cassette transporters MDR3, ABCG5, and ABCG8, human homologue scavenger receptor BI, sterol response element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and LDL receptor were determined by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil significantly reduced CYP7A1 mRNA levels. The three fibrates tested raised the mRNA levels of ABCG5 and SREBP-2, but only bezafibrate induced significant changes. Although MDR-3 mRNA levels were slightly increased by the three fibrates, no significant differences were obtained.
These results show for the first time that fibrate administration to humans downregulates CYP7A1. Although ABCG5 and SREBP-2 mRNA levels were slightly increased by all treatment groups, only bezafibrate induced significant changes.
Increased serum triglyceride levels constitute a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Apolipoprotein CIII (Apo CIII) is a determinant of serum triglyceride metabolism. In this study, we investigated whether activators of the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) modulate Apo CIII gene expression.
The influence of bile acids and synthetic FXR activators on Apo CIII and triglyceride metabolism was studied in vivo by using FXR wild-type and FXR-deficient mice and in vitro by using human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells.
In mice, treatment with the FXR agonist taurocholic acid strongly decreased serum triglyceride levels, an effect associated with reduced Apo CIII serum and liver messenger RNA levels. By contrast, no change was observed in FXR-deficient mice. Incubation of human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells with bile acids or the nonsteroidal synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 resulted in a dose-dependent down-regulation of Apo CIII gene expression. Promoter transfection experiments and mutation analysis showed that bile acid-activated FXR decrease human Apo CIII promoter activity via a negative FXR response element located in the I(4) footprint between nucleotides -739 and -704. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that bile acid treatment led to binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers to and displacement of HNF4alpha from this site. Bile acid treatment still repressed liver Apo CIII gene expression in hepatic HNF4alpha-deficient mice, suggesting an active rather than a competitive mechanism of Apo CIII repression by the FXR.
We identified bile acid and synthetic activators of the nuclear FXR as negative regulators of Apo CIII expression, an effect that may contribute to the triglyceride-decreasing action of FXR agonists.
Recent advances in molecular biology have greatly accelerated knowledge relating to the significance of the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. This review highlights the role that both oxysterols and bile salts play as ligands which, when bound to nuclear hormone receptors, activate transcription factors that set into play feed-forward catabolism of cholesterol to bile salts and feedback control of bile acid synthesis. The nuclear hormone receptors, liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) both combined as heterodimers with retinoid X receptor and with oxysterols and bile salts, respectively as their ligands, initiate powerful genetic controls over cholesterol and bile acid homeostatic mechanisms. LXR/RXR signals molecular control of feed-forward catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids while FXR/RXR initiates feedback control of bile acid synthesis. An additional nuclear hormone receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), is required to inhibit the competence factor, liver receptor homolog-1 to achieve repression of bile acid synthesis in the liver and in so doing SHP autoregulates its own function. Additionally, while bile acid synthesis is repressed, pool size is preserved by the action of FXR/RXR at both hepatic and intestinal levels, which genetically signals enhanced hepatocyte bile salt transport by the bile salt export pump (BSEP) and the ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) for ileal reabsorption. During activation of cholesterol catabolism, LXR/RXR enhances reverse cholesterol transport by increasing cholesterol efflux via the ABC-1 transporter from extrahepatic cells. This cholesterol is then taken up by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and transported back to the liver for further cholesterol catabolism and elimination in bile. The genetic coordination of nuclear hormone receptor function within the territory of the enterohepatic of bile salts allows for normal cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis thereby preventing atherosclerosis.
Hydrophobic bile acids strongly repressed transcription of the human cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) repressed CYP7A1/Luc reporter activity in a transfection assay in human liver-derived HepG2 cells, but not in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. FXR-binding activity was required for bile acid repression of CYP7A1 transcription despite the fact that FXR did not bind to the CYP7A1 promoter. FXR-induced liver-specific factors must be required for mediating bile acid repression. Bile acids and FXR repressed endogenous CYP7A1 but stimulated alpha-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA expression in HepG2 cells. Feeding of rats with chenodeoxycholic acid repressed CYP7A1, induced FTF, but had no effect on SHP mRNA expression in the liver. FTF strongly repressed CYP7A1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner, and SHP further inhibited CYP7A1 in HepG2 cells, but not in HEK 293 cells. FXR only moderately stimulated SHP transcription, whereas FTF strongly inhibited SHP transcription in HepG2 cells. Results revealed that FTF was a dominant negative factor that was induced by bile acid-activated FXR to inhibit both CYP7A1 and SHP transcription. Differential regulation of FTF and SHP expression by bile acids may explain the wide variation in CYP7A1 expression and the rate of bile acid synthesis and regulation in different species.
To investigate the molecular events controlling reverse cholesterol transport, we compared gene expression of normal mouse liver to that of mice fed a long chain (LC) omega-3 fatty acid-enriched diet. Using cDNA microarrays, we assessed expression levels of 1176 genes, and we found that D-site binding protein (DBP) was three-fold increased in mice on a LC omega-3 fatty acid-rich diet compared to controls. DBP is known to increase transcriptional level of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (C7alpha), the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid production and cholesterol excretion, and we found that C7alpha mRNA was also up-regulated by LC omega-3 fatty acids. Moreover, liver X receptor-alpha, another transcription factor up-regulating C7alpha, was three- to four-fold increased in liver of treated mice. On the other hand, we demonstrated that bile acid and cholesterol excretion were two-fold increased. These results show that LC omega-3 fatty acids control cholesterol metabolism in mice at a new endpoint.
Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) regulates the balance between cholesterol supply and metabolism by catalyzing the rate-limiting step of bile acid biosynthesis. The transcriptional activity of CYP7A1 is tightly controlled by various nuclear receptors. A forkhead transcription factor O1 (FOXO1) plays a critical role in metabolism, and insulin inactivates FOXO1 through Akt-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion. We investigated the role of insulin- Akt-FOXO1 signaling pathway in CYP7A1 transcriptional regulation since we found putative insulin-response elements, FOXO1 binding sequences, in both rat and human CYP7A1 promoters. However, ectopic expression of FOXO1 increased the rat CYP7A1-, but mildly reduced human CYP7A1-promoter activities in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly to bile acids, insulin treatment increased small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA rapidly and transiently, leading to the suppression of CYP7A1 transcription in both human and rodents. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that FOXO1 directly bound to rat CYP1A1 promoter in the absence of insulin. FOXO1 binding to the rat promoter was diminished by insulin treatment as well as by expression of SHP. Our results suggest that the stimulation of insulin- signaling pathway of Akt-FOXO1 and SHP expression may regulate cholesterol/bile acid metabolisms in liver, linking carbohydrate and cholesterol metabolic pathways. A prolonged exposure of insulin in hyperinsulinemic insulin resistance or diabetic status represses CYP7A1 transcription and bile acid biosynthesis through SHP induction and FOXO1 inactivation, leading to impairment of the hepatic cholesterol/bile acid metabolisms.
Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is an endocrine factor produced by the small intestine in response to uptake of luminal bile salts. In the liver, FGF19 binds to FGF receptor-4, resulting in down-regulation of cytochrome P (CYP) 7A1 and reduced bile salt synthesis. Down-regulation of CYP7A1 under cholestatic conditions has been attributed to bile salt-mediated induction of the transcriptional repressor short heterodimer partner (SHP), because the interrupted enterohepatic cycle of bile salts is thought to abrogate intestinal FGF19 production and thus result in lowering of plasma FGF19 levels. Unexpectedly, we observed marked elevation of plasma FGF19 in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis caused by a pancreatic tumor (2.3 +/- 2.3 in cholestatic versus 0.40 +/- 0.25 ng/mL and 0.29 +/- 0.12 ng/mL in postcholestatic patients who received preoperative drainage by biliary stenting, P = 0.004, and noncholestatic control patients, P = 0.04, respectively). Although FGF19 messenger RNA (mRNA) is virtually absent in normal liver, FGF19 mRNA was strongly increased (31-fold to 374-fold, P &lt; 0.001) in the liver of cholestatic patients in comparison with drained and control patients. In the absence of changes in SHP mRNA, CYP7A1 mRNA was strongly reduced (7.2-fold to 24-fold, P &lt; 0.005) in the liver of cholestatic patients in comparison with drained and control patients, indicating an alternative regulatory pathway. Alterations in transcripts encoding hepatobiliary transporters [adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily C, member 3 (ABCC3)/multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), organic solute transporter alpha/beta (OSTalpha/beta), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1)] further suggest that bile salts are secreted via a nonbiliary route in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis.
The liver expresses FGF19 under conditions of extrahepatic cholestasis. This is accompanied by a number of adaptations aimed at protecting the liver against bile salt toxicity. FGF19 signaling may be involved in some of these adaptations.
The effects of rifampicin treatment on SULT2A1 mRNA expression were evaluated in 23 preparations of primary cultured human hepatocytes. In contrast to the consistently occurring induction of CYP3A4, a prototypical pregnane X receptor (PXR) target gene, rifampicin treatment increased SULT2A1 mRNA levels in 12 of the hepatocyte preparations, but it produced little change or even suppression in the others. Transient transfection of HepG2 cells with a series of reporter constructs implicated two SULT2A1 5'-flanking regions as containing rifampicin-responsive information. Each of these regions contained a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binding site (at nucleotide [nt] -6160 and -54), as demonstrated by in vitro binding and site-directed mutagenesis. HNF4alpha bound to the HNF4-54 region of the endogenous SULT2A1 gene, as indicated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cotransfection of HepG2 cells with pregnane X receptor (PXR) dose-dependently suppressed reporter expression from SULT2A1 constructs containing the HNF4 sites, and rifampicin treatment augmented the suppression. Rifampicin treatment concentration-dependently suppressed SULT2A1 reporter expression at the same concentrations that progressively induced expression from a PXR-responsive CYP3A4 reporter, whereas higher rifampicin concentrations reversed the SULT2A1 suppression. The suppressive effect of rifampicin was diminished, whereas the activating effect was augmented, in HepG2 cells with RNA interference-mediated PXR knockdown. These results suggest that HNF4alpha plays a central role in the control of SULT2A1 transcription and that rifampicin-liganded PXR suppresses SULT2A1 expression by interfering with HNF4alpha activity. By contrast, the rifampicin-inducible SULT2A1 expression that occurs in many human hepatocyte preparations seems to be mediated through a PXR-independent mechanism.
The transcription of the gene (CYP7A1) encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis, is repressed by bile acids via multiple mechanisms involving members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Here, we describe a regulatory mechanism that can be exploited for modulating bile acid synthesis. By dissecting the mechanisms of CYP7A1 transcription, we found that bile acids stimulate the sequential recruitment of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) 7, 3, and 1, and of the corepressor SMRTalpha (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors-alpha) and the nuclear corepressor. Bile acids, but not the farnesoid X receptor-selective agonist GW4064, increase the nuclear concentration of HDAC7, which promotes the assembly of a repressive complex that ultimately represses CYP7A1 transcription. Interestingly, despite its high basal expression level, small heterodimer partner (SHP) is associated with the CYP7A1 promoter only at a later stage of bile acid repression. Gene silencing with small interfering RNA confirms that HDAC7 is the key factor required for the repression of CYP7A1 transcription, whereas knockdown of SHP does not prevent the down-regulation of CYP7A1. Administration of the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid or trichostatin A to genetically hypercholesterolemic mice increases Cyp7a1 messenger RNA and bile acid synthesis and consequently markedly reduces total plasma and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
By using a combination of molecular, cellular, and animal models, our study highlights the importance of HDACs in the feedback regulation of CYP7A1 transcription and identifies these enzymes as potential targets to modulate bile acid synthesis and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
TALLYHO/Jng (TH) mice reveal hypercholesterolemia at an early age before their plasma glucose levels have increased. The increased plasma cholesterol should be related to bile acids (BAs) metabolism, because cholesterol is the precursor of BAs and BAs change cholesterol metabolism in a feedback manner. We analyzed the BAs pool size, BAs composition, and expression levels of several proteins that have key roles in BAs synthesis, excretion, and reabsorption and compared them to those of C57BL/6 (B6) mice to study BAs metabolism in TH mice. TH mice exhibited an increased total BAs pool size, increased BAs content in the cecum feces, and an increased ratio of muricholic acid (MCA)/cholic acid (CA). The mRNA and protein levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and the ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 5 (Abcg5) were elevated in the liver but not in the apical sodium bile acid transporter (Asbt) and organic solute transporters (Osts) in the ileum. These results indicate that synthesis and the excretion of BAs from the liver to the gallbladder might be elevated, but the reabsorption rate of BAs in the ileum might be reduced. The declined expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (Fgfr4) was respectively identified in the ileum and the liver, indicating the disrupted feedback inhibition of Cyp7a1. Consequently, hypercholesterolemia in TH mice might increase the BAs amounts via the interrupted Fxr/Fgf15/Fgfr4-mediated feedback regulation of Cyp7a1.
Hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic properties of ginger in animal models have been reported. However, information related to the mechanisms and factors involved in the metabolic effects of ginger at a hepatic level are limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate molecular factors involved in the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of a hydroethanolic ginger extract (GE) in the liver of rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The study was conducted in male Wistar rats divided into the following 3 groups: (i) Rats fed a standard diet (3.5% fat), the control group; (ii) rats fed an HFD (33.5% fat); and (iii) rats fed an HFD treated with GE (250 mg·kg-1·day-1) for 5 weeks (HFD+GE). Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, lipid profile, leptin, and adiponectin were measured. Liver expression of glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), PPARα and PPARγ, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2), liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1c), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and collagen I was measured. Data were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA, followed by a Newman-Keuls test if differences were noted. The study showed that GE improved lipid profile and attenuated the increase of plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and leptin in HFD rats. This effect was associated with a higher liver expression of PPARα, PPARγ, and GLUT-2 and an enhancement of plasma adiponectin levels. Furthermore, GE reduced liver expression of GPAT, SREBP1c, CTGF, and collagen I. The results suggest that GE might be considered as an alternative therapeutic strategy in the management of overweight and hepatic and metabolic-related alterations.
Catch-up growth in adult, is increasingly recognized as an important causative factor for the extremely prevalent insulin resistance-related diseases especially in developing countries/territories. We aimed to investigate the alteration of bile acids level, phosphorylation and sumoylation of its interacting protein, bile acid receptor/farnesoid X receptor and their downstream signaling pathway, as well as insulin sensitivity and lipid profile in catch-up growth in adult rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into four groups for two sampling points: caloric restriction group, catch-up growth in adult refed with normal chow and their normal chow controls for four or eight weeks (N4, N8 individually).We found that total serum bile acids and farnesoid X receptor phosphorylation increased without significant changes in farnesoid X receptor sumoylation and its downstream small heterodimer partner expression at the end of caloric restriction stage, while the visceral fat decreased and insulin resistance never occurred in these animals; After refeeding, total serum bile acids, farnesoid X receptor phosphorylation and sumoylation, as well as Cyp7a1, SREBP-1c mRNA levels were higher with significant decrease in small heterodimer partner expression, which is associated fat accumulation, and drastic insulin resistance in whole body and skeletal muscle. Our findings demonstrated that the fat accumulation and insulin resistance are associated with increases of bile acids, alteration of farnesoid X receptor phosphorylation, and sumoylation and its downstream signaling pathway. These changes of bile acids, farnesoid X receptor phosphorylation and sumoylation, as well as their downstream signaling might be of importance in the etiology of fat accumulation and insulin resistance in catch-up growth in adult.
Bile acids (BAs) play a crucial role in dietary fat digestion and in the regulation of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland that directly regulates several metabolic pathways. However, the impact of TSH on BA homeostasis remains largely unknown.
We analyzed serum BA and TSH levels in healthy volunteers under strict control of caloric intake. Thyroidectomized rats were administered thyroxine and injected with different doses of TSH. Tshr(-/-) mice were supplemented with thyroxine, and C57BL/6 mice were injected with Tshr-siRNA via the tail vein. The serum BA levels, BA pool size, and fecal BA excretion rate were measured. The regulation of SREBP-2, HNF-4α, and CYP7A1 by TSH were analyzed using luciferase reporter, RNAi, EMSA, and CHIP assays.
A negative correlation was observed between the serum levels of TSH and the serum BA levels in healthy volunteers. TSH administration led to a decrease in BA content and CYP7A1 activity in thyroidectomized rats supplemented with thyroxine. When Tshr was silenced in mice, the BA pool size, fecal BA excretion rate, and serum BA levels all increased. Additionally, we found that HNF-4α acts as a critical molecule through which TSH represses CYP7A1 activity. We further confirmed that the accumulation of mature SREBP-2 protein could impair the capacity of nuclear HNF-4α to bind to the CYP7A1 promoter, a mechanism that appears to mediate the effects of TSH.
TSH represses hepatic BA synthesis via a SREBP-2/HNF-4α/CYP7A1 signaling pathway. This finding strongly supports the notion that TSH is an important pathophysiological regulator of liver BA homeostasis independently of thyroid hormones.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is positively associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease risk. Apo-10'-lycopenoic acid (APO10LA), a potential oxidation product of apo-10'-lycopenal that is generated endogenously by β-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase (BCO2) cleavage of lycopene, inhibited hepatic steatosis in BCO2-expressing mice.
The present study evaluated lycopene and APO10LA effects on hepatic steatosis in mice without BCO2 expression.
Male and female BCO2-knockout (BCO2-KO) mice were fed a high saturated fat diet (HSFD) with or without APO10LA (10 mg/kg diet) or lycopene (100 mg/kg diet) for 12 wk.
Lycopene or APO10LA supplementation reduced hepatic steatosis incidence (78% and 72%, respectively) and severity in BCO2-KO male mice. Female mice did not develop steatosis, had greater hepatic total cholesterol (3.06 vs. 2.31 mg/g tissue) and cholesteryl ester (1.58 vs. 0.86 mg/g tissue), but had lower plasma triglyceride (TG) (229 vs. 282 mg/dL) and cholesterol (97.1 vs. 119 mg/dL) than male mice. APO10LA-mitigated steatosis in males was associated with reduced hepatic total cholesterol (18%) and activated sirtuin 1 signaling, which resulted in reduced fatty acids (FAs) and TG synthesis markers [stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase protein, 71%; acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation, 79%; AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, 67%], and elevated cholesterol efflux genes (cytochrome P450 family 7A1, 65%; ATP-binding cassette transporter G5/8, 11%). These APO10LA-mediated effects were not mimicked by lycopene supplementation. Intriguingly, steatosis inhibition by lycopene induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α- and PPARγ-related genes in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) that increases mitochondrial uncoupling [cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, α subunit-like effector a, 55%; PR domain-containing 16, 47%; uncoupling protein 3 (Ucp3), 55%], FA β-oxidation (PPARα, 53%; very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 38%), and uptake (FA transport protein 4, 29%; lipoprotein lipase 43%). Expressions of 10 MAT PPAR-related genes were inversely correlated with steatosis score, suggesting that lycopene reduced steatosis by increasing MAT FA utilization.
Our data suggest that lycopene and APO10LA inhibit HSFD-induced steatosis in BCO2-KO male mice through differential mechanisms. Sex disparity of BCO2-KO mice was observed in the outcomes of HSFD-induced liver steatosis and plasma lipids.
Sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) and regulates cholesterol homeostasis. In Cyp27a1/ Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) double knockout (KO) mice fed with Western diet (WD), the atherosclerotic phenotype found in ApoE KO mice was reversed. As protective mechanism, up-regulation of Cyp3a11 and Cyp7a1 was proposed. Cyp27a1 heterozygote/ApoE KO (het) mice, with reduced Cyp27a1 expression and normal levels of Cyp7a1 and Cyp3a11, developed more severe lesions than ApoE KO mice. To analyze the contribution of Cyp3a11 to the protection of atherosclerosis development, Cyp3a11 was induced by Rifampicin (RIF) in ApoE KO and het mice. Males were fed with WD and treated daily with RIF (10 mg/kg ip) or vehicle for 4 weeks. Atherosclerosis was quantified in the aortic valve. Plasma lipids and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), expression of cytochromes P450 and genes involved in cholesterol transport and bile acids (BAs) signaling in liver and intestine, and intestinal cholesterol absorption were analyzed. RIF increased expression of hepatic but not intestinal Cyp3a11 4-fold in both genotypes. In ApoE KO mice treated with RIF, we found a 2-fold decrease in plasma cholesterol, and a 2-fold increase in high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein ratio and CY27A1 activity. Intestinal cholesterol absorption remained unchanged and atherosclerotic lesions decreased approximately 3-fold. In het mice, RIF had no effect on plasma lipids composition, CYP27A1 activity, and atherosclerotic plaque development, despite a reduction in cholesterol absorption. In conclusion, the antiatherogenic effect of Cyp3a11 induction by RIF was also dependent on Cyp27a1 expression.
Previous studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are capable of decreasing plasma cholesterol. However, the relative plasma-cholesterol-lowering activity of individual SCFAs and the underlying mechanisms by which SCFAs decrease plasma cholesterol remain largely unknown. The present study was done to compare the plasma-cholesterol-lowering potencies of four common SCFAs with 2-5 carbons and to investigate their interactions with gene expressions of key regulatory factors involved in cholesterol metabolism. For 6 weeks, five groups of male Golden hamsters were fed either a control high-cholesterol diet (HCD) or one of the four experimental HCDs containing 0.5 mol of acetate (Ac), propionate (Pr), butyrate (Bu), or valerate (Va) per kilogram of the diet. The results showed that Ac, Pr, and Bu significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol (TC) by 24, 18, and 17% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. All four SCFAs could decrease non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and the non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio. The addition of Ac, Pr, or Bu into the diet significantly promoted fecal excretion of bile acids by 121, 113, or 120% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, and upregulated the gene expressions of sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the liver. It was concluded that SCFAs with 2-4 carbons (Ac, Pr, and Bu) are more hypocholesterolemic than Va, which has 5 carbons, via enhancing fecal excretion of bile acids and promoting the hepatic uptake of cholesterol from the blood.
To investigate the association of the polymorphic variants -204A &gt; C (rs 3808607) in the CYP7A1 gene with the development of dyslipidemias in healthy individuals, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and in those with NAFLD concurrent with hypothyroidism.
DNA samples and lipidograms were examined in 180 patients, including 60 healthy individuals (Group 1), 60 patients with hypothyroidism concurrent with NAFLD (Group 2), and 60 patients with NAFLD (Group 3). All the patients underwent ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland and abdominal cavity organs; FibroMax scores were calculated.
All the study groups most frequently showed a homozygous AA genotype (86.6% of cases in Group 1, 80% in Group 2, and 83.3% in Group 3). The development of NAFLD in CC genotype carriers is characterized by the most pronounced changes in lipid metabolism (atherogenic index (AI), 7.32 in Group 3) compared to the genotypes AA (AI, 4.56 in Group 2 and 1.73 in Group 1) and CC (AI, 6.43 in Group 2 and 2.52 in Group 1) in functional insufficiency of thyroid hormones and relative normal conditions.
The analysis of the relationship of polymorphic variants CYP7A1 rs 38088607 to lipid metabolic disturbances in the study groups showed that the significantly higher levels of atherogenic cholesterol fractions were determined in the CC genotype compared to AA genotype carriers and they did not depend on the presence of NAFLD and hypothyroidism. The findings make it possible to consider the AA homozygous genotype of variant mutation CYP7A1 rs 38088607 as protective against dyslipidemia. However, in functional insufficiency of thyroid hormones, the level of triglycerides is significantly higher in both genotypes, which suggests that hypothyroidism plays an essential role in the development of dyslipidemia and NAFLD.
Цель исследования. Изучение связи полиморфных вариантов -204А &gt; С (rs 3808607) гена CYP7A1 с развитием дислипидемий у практически здоровых лиц, у больных с неалкогольной жировой болезнью печени (НАЖБП) и при сочетании НАЖБП с гипотиреозом. Материалы и методы. Исследовали образцы ДНК и липидограммы 180 пациентов (1-я группа - 60 здоровых, 2-я группа - 60 больных с гипотиреозом и НАЖБП, 3-я группа - 60 больных с НАЖБП). Все пациенты прошли ультразвуковое исследование щитовидной железы, органов брюшной полости; рассчитан тест ФиброМакс. Результаты. Во всех обследуемых группах чаще всего встречался гомозиготный генотип АА (86,6% случаев в 1-й группе, 80% случаев во 2-й группе и 83,3% случаев в 3-й группе). Развитие НАЖБП у носителей генотипа СС характеризуется наиболее выраженными изменениями липидного метаболизма (индекс атерогенности - ИА 7,32 в 3-й группе) по сравнению с генотипами АА (ИА 4,56 во 2-й группе и 1,73 в 1-й группе) и СС (ИА 6,43 во 2-й группе и 2,52 в 1-й группе) при состояниях функциональной недостаточности тиреоидных гормонов и относительной нормы. Заключение. Проведенный анализ связи полиморфных вариантов rs 38088607 гена CYP7A1 с нарушением липидного обмена в обследуемых группах показал, что достоверно более высокие уровни атерогенных фракций холестерина определялись при генотипе СС по сравнению с носителями генотипа AA и не зависили от наличия НАЖБП и гипотиреоза. Полученные данные позволяют рассматривать гомозиготный генотип АА как протекторный по отношению к дислипидемии вариант мутации rs 38088607 гена CYP7A1. Однако при состояниях функциональной недостаточности тиреоидных гормонов уровень триглицеридов достоверно выше при обоих генотипах, что свидетельствует о существенной роли гипотиреоза в развитии дислипидемий и НАЖБП.
Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) could induce intrauterine programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-associated neuroendocrine metabolism, resulting in intrauterine growth retardation and susceptibility to adult hypercholesterolemia in offspring. This study aimed to analyse the effects and interactions of PEE, a post-weaning high-fat diet (HFD) and gender on the occurrence of adult hypercholesterolemia in offspring rats.
Wistar female rats were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg.d) at gestational days 11-20. The offspring were given a normal diet or HFD after weaning, and the blood cholesterol metabolism phenotype and expression of hepatic cholesterol metabolism related genes were detected in 24-week-old offspring. Furthermore, the interactions among PEE, HFD, and gender on hypercholesterolemia occurrence were analysed.
PEE increased the serum total cholesterol (TCH) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and decreased the serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level in adult offspring rats; the changes in female offspring were greater than those in males. At the same time, the mRNA expression levels of hepatic cholesterol metabolic enzymes (apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1))-were increased, while the mRNA expression levels of the scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) and LDL receptor (LDLR) were decreased. Furthermore, a three-way ANOVA showed there were interactions among PEE, post-weaning HFD and gender. For PEE offspring, a post-weaning HFD aggravated the elevated hepatic ApoB and CYP7A1 expression and reduced SR-B1 and LDLR expression; the changes in hepatic SR-B1 and CYP7A1 expression were greater in female HFD rats than in males.
Our findings suggest that a post-weaning HFD could aggravate offspring hypercholesterolemia caused by PEE and that this mechanism might be associated with hepatic cholesterol metabolic disorders that are aggravated by a post-weaning HFD; hepatic cholesterol metabolism was more sensitive to neuroendocrine metabolic alterations by PEE and a post-weaning HFD in the female offspring than in the male offspring.
Epidemiological and clinical studies have indicated that nut consumption could be a healthy dietary strategy to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and related cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this review is to examine the potential mechanisms of action of nuts addressing effects on glycemic control, weight management, energy balance, appetite, gut microbiota modification, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function and blood pressure with a focus on data from both animal and human studies. The favourable effects of nuts could be explained by the unique nutrient composition and bioactive compounds in nuts. Unsaturated fatty acids (monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids) present in nuts may play a role in glucose control and appetite suppression. Fiber and polyphenols in nuts may also have an anti-diabetic effect by altering gut microbiota. Nuts lower serum cholesterol by reduced cholesterol absorption, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and increased bile acid production by stimulation of 7-α hydroxylase. Arginine and magnesium improve inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial function and blood pressure. In conclusion, nuts contain compounds that favourably influence glucose homeostasis, weight control and vascular health. Further investigations are required to identify the most important mechanisms by which nuts decrease the risk of T2DM and CVD.
Underlying mechanisms responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of β-glucan have been proposed, yet have not been fully demonstrated. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the consumption of barley β-glucan lowers cholesterol by affecting the cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis or bile acid synthesis. In addition, this study was aimed to assess whether the underlying mechanisms are related to cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) SNP rs3808607 as proposed by us earlier. In a controlled, randomised, cross-over study, participants with mild hypercholesterolaemia (n 30) were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high-molecular weight (HMW), 5 g low-molecular weight (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet, each for 5 weeks. Cholesterol absorption was determined by assessing the enrichment of circulating 13C-cholesterol over 96 h following oral administration; fractional rate of synthesis for cholesterol was assessed by measuring the incorporation rate of 2H derived from deuterium oxide within the body water pool into the erythrocyte cholesterol pool over 24 h; bile acid synthesis was determined by measuring serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one concentrations. Consumption of 3 g HMW β-glucan decreased total cholesterol (TC) levels (P=0·029), but did not affect cholesterol absorption (P=0·25) or cholesterol synthesis (P=0·14). Increased bile acid synthesis after consumption of 3 g HMW β-glucan was observed in all participants (P=0·049), and more pronounced in individuals carrying homozygous G of rs3808607 (P=0·033). In addition, a linear relationship between log (viscosity) of β-glucan and serum 7α-HC concentration was observed in homozygous G allele carriers. Results indicate that increased bile acid synthesis rather than inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis may be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. The pronounced TC reduction in G allele carriers of rs3808607 observed in the previous study may be due to enhanced bile acid synthesis in response to high-viscosity β-glucan consumption in those individuals.
The present study investigated the regulatory effects of fish oil and chitosan on the signals of hepatic lipid metabolism and the postulated mechanism in high-fat diet-induced obese rats. Diet supplementation of chitosan and fish oil efficiently suppressed the increased weights in body and livers of high-fat diet-fed rats. Supplementation of chitosan and fish oil significantly decreased the activities of hepatic lipid biosynthesis-related enzymes and efficiently regulated plasma lipoprotein homeostasis. Both chitosan and fish oil significantly ameliorated the alterations in the protein expressions of hepatic lipogenic transcription factors (LXRα and PPARα), and could also significantly regulate the downstream hepatic lipogenic genes (FAS, HMGCR, CYP7A1, FATP, FABP, AOX, and ABCA) expressions in high-fat diet-fed rats. These results suggest that both fish oil and chitosan exerts downregulative effects on hepatic lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese rats via the LXRα inhibition and PPARα activation, which further affect the expressions of hepatic lipogenesis-associated genes.
The beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on cardiovascular disease have been studied extensively. However, it remains unclear to what extent n-3 PUFAs may impact Reverse Cholesterol Transport (RCT). RCT describes a mechanism by which excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues is transported to the liver for hepatobiliary excretion, thereby inhibiting foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerosis. The aim of this review is to summarize the literature and to provide an updated overview of the effects of n-3 PUFAs on key players in RCT, including apoliprotein AI (apoA-I), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1, apoE, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and ABCG5/G8. Based on current knowledge, we conclude that n-3 PUFAs may beneficially affect RCT, mainly by influencing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) remodeling and by promoting hepatobiliary sterol excretion.
Populations with essential hypertension have a high risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this study, we investigated the mechanism that underlies the progression of hypertension-associated NASH by comparing differences in the development of high fat and cholesterol (HFC) diet-induced NASH among three strains of rats, i.e., two hypertensive strains comprising spontaneously hypertensive rats and the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive 5/Dmcr, and the original Wistar Kyoto rats as the normotensive control. We investigated histopathological changes and molecular signals related to inflammation in the liver after feeding with the HFC diet for 8 weeks. The diet induced severe lobular inflammation and fibrosis in the livers of the hypertensive rats, whereas it only caused mild steatohepatitis in the normotensive rats. An increased activation of proinflammatory signaling (transforming growth factor-β1/mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway) was observed in the hypertensive strains fed with the HFC diet. In addition, the HFC diet suppressed the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway in the hypertensive rats and led to lower increases in the hepatic expression of heme oxygenase-1, which has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. In conclusion, these signaling pathways might play crucial roles in the development of hypertension-associated NASH.
