<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generaci√≥n de archivo html</title></head><body>The induction of CYP2B gene expression by phenobarbital (PB) is mediated by the translocation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The CAR/RXR heterodimer binds to two DR-4 sites in a complex phenobarbital responsive unit (PBRU) in the CYP2B gene. The short heterodimer partner (SHP), an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain, was initially identified by its interaction with CAR. We have examined the role of SHP in CAR-mediated transactivation of the CYP2B gene. Coexpression of SHP inhibited the transactivation of the CYP2B gene by CAR in cultured hepatoma cells and the p160 coactivator GRIP1 reversed the inhibition. The interaction of CAR with SHP was confirmed by GST pulldown experiments. SHP did not block the binding of either CAR/RXR to the PBRU or binding of GRIP1 to the CAR/RXR complex in gel mobility shift assays, but slightly increased CAR/RXR binding and slightly altered the mobility of the CAR/RXR/GRIP1 complex, suggesting an interaction of SHP with these complexes. The presence of SHP in the complexes, however, could not be detected in an antibody supershift assay. Recombinant corepressors mSin3A, SMRT, and HDAC1, but not NCoR1, interacted with GST-SHP but each of these corepressors in liver nuclear extracts bound to GST-SHP. SMRT and NCoR1 inhibited CAR-mediated activation independent of SHP, but mSin3A and HDAC1 had little effect alone, and were additive with SHP. These studies demonstrate that SHP does not inhibit CAR-mediated trans-activation by interfering with DNA binding or by competition with GRIP1. Instead, SHP may either inhibit recruitment of other coactivators by GRIP1 or actively recruit corepressors directly to the CAR/RXR/PBRU complex.
The apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2), also called the ileal bile acid transporter, mediates the intestinal absorption of bile salts. The efficiency of this transport process is a determinant of hepatic bile salt synthesis from cholesterol and of serum triglyceride levels. Our aim was to characterize the human ASBT gene promoter with respect to regulatory mechanisms that coordinately affect ASBT expression and hepatic lipid and bile salt metabolism. The minimal construct that confers full promoter activity contains three functional hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) recognition sites, explaining the dependence of ASBT gene expression upon HNF1alpha. A nuclear receptor binding site arranged as a direct hexanucleotide repeat (DR1 motif) is localized approximately 1.6 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. Constructs containing this element were transactivated by WY14643 and ciprofibrate, ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), in Caco2 cells. The DR1 element was shown to bind the PPARalpha/9-cis-retinoic acid receptor heterodimer, and targeted mutagenesis of the DR1 motif abolished PPARalpha responsiveness. Ciprofibrate treatment of SK-ChA cholangiocytes increased ASBT mRNA levels, suggesting a physiologic role for PPARalpha-mediated ASBT gene regulation. This study identifies PPARalpha as a novel link between ileal bile salt absorption and hepatic lipid metabolism.
Sister of P-glycoprotein (SPGP) is the major hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP). BSEP/SPGP expression varies dramatically among human livers. The potency and hierarchy of bile acids as ligands for the farnesyl/bile acid receptor (FXR/BAR) paralleled their ability to induce BSEP in human hepatocyte cultures. FXR:RXR heterodimers bound to IR1 elements and enhanced bile acid transcriptional activation of the mouse and human BSEP/SPGP promoters. In FXR/BAR nullizygous mice, which have dramatically reduced BSEP/SPGP levels, hepatic CYP3A11 and CYP2B10 were strongly but unexpectedly induced. Notably, the rank order of bile acids as CYP3A4 inducers and activators of pregnane X receptor/steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR) closely paralleled each other but was markedly different from their hierarchy and potency as inducers of BSEP in human hepatocytes. Moreover, the hepatoprotective bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid, which reverses hydrophobic bile acid hepatotoxicity, activates PXR and efficaciously induces CYP3A4 (a bile-metabolizing enzyme) in primary human hepatocytes thus providing one mechanism for its hepatoprotection. Because serum and urinary bile acids increased in FXR/BAR -/- mice, we evaluated hepatic transporters for compensatory changes that might circumvent the profound decrease in BSEP/SPGP. We found weak MRP3 up-regulation. In contrast, MRP4 was substantially increased in the FXR/BAR nullizygous mice and was further elevated by cholic acid. Thus, enhanced hepatocellular concentrations of bile acids, due to the down-regulation of BSEP/SPGP-mediated efflux in FXR nullizygous mice, result in an alternate but apparent compensatory up-regulation of CYP3A, CYP2B, and some ABC transporters that is consistent with activation of PXR/SXR by bile acids.
The vectorial transport of bile salts from blood into bile is essential for the generation of bile flow, solubilization of cholesterol in bile, and emulsification of lipids in the intestine. Major transport proteins involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts include the hepatocellular bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11), the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT, SLC10A2) in cholangiocytes and enterocytes, the sodium-dependent hepatocyte bile salt uptake system NTCP (SLC10A1), the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP-C (SLC21A6), OATP8 (SLC21A8) and OATP-A (SLC21A3), and the multidrug resistance protein MRP3 (ABCC3). Synthesis and transport of bile salts are intricately linked processes that undergo extensive feedback and feed-forward regulation by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. A key regulator of hepatocellular bile salt homeostasis is the bile acid receptor/farnesoid X receptor FXR, which activates transcription of the BSEP and OATP8 genes and of the small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP). SHP is a transcriptional repressor that mediates bile acid-induced repression of the bile salt uptake systems rat Ntcp and human OATP-C. A nuclear receptor that activates rodent Oatp2 (Slc21a5) and human MRP2 (ABCC2) is the pregnane X receptor/steroid X receptor PXR/SXR. Intracellular trafficking and membrane insertion of bile salt transporters is regulated by lipid, protein, and extracellular signal-related kinases in response to physiologic stimuli such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate or taurocholate. Finally, dysfunction of individual bile salt transporters such as BSEP, on account of genetic mutations, steric inhibition, suppression of gene expression, or disturbed signaling, is an important cause of cholestatic liver disease.
Phenobarbital (PB) increases hepatic drug/steroid-metabolic capability by coordinately activating transcription of the genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. The nuclear receptor CAR was first implicated as a transcription factor that activates the cytochrome P450 Cyp2b10 gene. In response to PB, CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to a PB response element (typified by DR-4 motif), and activates transcription of the gene. In the CAR-null mouse, PB does not only induce the Cyp2b10 gene, but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. Thus, CAR is a general nuclear receptor that is essential for PB induction of drug/steroid metabolizing enzymes. PB also induces amino levulinate synthase 1 (ALAS-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, to increase heme supply. However, PB induction of the synthase occurs in CAR-null mice, suggesting that CAR does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of drug/steroid metabolism.
The functional mapping of the human cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) promoter in HepG2 cells revealed the presence of both positive and negative regulatory elements. One of these regulatory elements overlapped a sequence that is highly conserved in most members of the CYP2 family. This element, which consists of a degenerate AGGTCA direct repeat spaced by 1 base pair (DR1) and is known to be a target for members of the steroid receptor superfamily, was found to bind in vitro translated hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) in gel retardation analysis. Using HepG2 nuclear extracts, three protein-DNA complexes were formed on the DR1 element, one of which was confirmed to be dependent on the binding of HNF4. The other DR1 complexes were shown to be due to the interaction of the orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I (COUP-TFI). Experiments in COS-7 cells showed that HNF4 could activate the CYP2D6 promoter 30-fold. Surprisingly, mutation of the DR1 element produced a relatively minor 23% decrease in activity in HepG2 cells. Additionally, COUP-TFI was shown to inhibit HNF4 stimulation of the CYP2D6 promoter in COS-7 cells, suggesting that COUP-TFI could attenuate the effect of HNF4 in HepG2 cells. However, when HNF4 levels were increased in HepG2 cells by co-transfection, it resulted in the enhancement of CYP2D6 promoter activity, indicating that HNF4 could overcome the repressive effect of COUP-TFI. Therefore, the contribution of the DR1 element in controlling the transcription of the CYP2D6 gene depends on the balance between positively and negatively acting transcription factors.
1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) regulates the differentiation of keratinocytes. 1,25(OH)(2)D raises intracellular free calcium (Cai) as a necessary early step toward stimulating differentiation. 1,25(OH)(2)D induces the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) in keratinocytes and enhances the calcium response of these cells. Activation of the CaR by calcium increases intracellular free calcium by a mechanism involving phospholipase C (PLC) cleavage of phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate into inositoltrisphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol (DG). 1,25(OH)(2)D induces the family of PLCs. PLC-gamma1 has a DR6 VDRE in its promoter which binds and is activated by VDR/RAR rather than VDR/RXR. The involucrin gene, which encodes a critical component of the cornified envelope, contains a DR3 VDRE in its promoter that acts in conjunction with a nearby AP-1 site. The sequential regulation of these genes is critical for the differentiation process. In undifferentiated keratinocytes, the VDR binds preferentially to the DRIP complex of coactivators. However, with differentiation DRIP 205 is no longer produced, and the VDR switches partners to the SRC family (SRC2 and 3). These studies suggest that at least part of the sequential activation of genes required during keratinocyte differentiation is regulated by the change (availability) of these different coactivator complexes.
The catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids is regulated by oxysterols and bile acids, which induce or repress transcription of the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). The nuclear receptor LXRalpha binds oxysterols and mediates feed-forward induction. Here, we show that repression is coordinately regulated by a triumvirate of nuclear receptors, including the bile acid receptor, FXR; the promoter-specific activator, LRH-1; and the promoter-specific repressor, SHP. Feedback repression of CYP7A1 is accomplished by the binding of bile acids to FXR, which leads to transcription of SHP. Elevated SHP protein then inactivates LRH-1 by forming a heterodimeric complex that leads to promoter-specific repression of both CYP7A1 and SHP. These results reveal an elaborate autoregulatory cascade mediated by nuclear receptors for the maintenance of hepatic cholesterol catabolism.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) plays a key role in maintaining lipid and bile salt homeostasis as it is the rate-limiting enzyme converting cholesterol to bile acids. Deficiency of CYP7A1 leads to hyperlipidemia in man and mouse. Hyperlipidemia is often seen in patients when treated with high-dose retinoic acid (RA), but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our present study revealed that CYP7A1 mRNA expression is greatly repressed by RA in both human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells where increased fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) expressions were also observed, suggesting farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) were activated. Promoter reporter assays demonstrate that all-trans RA (atRA) specifically activated FXR/RXR. However, detailed molecular analyses indicate that this activation is through RXR, whose ligand is 9-cis RA. Knocking down of FXR or RXRalpha by small interference RNA (siRNA) in human hepatocytes increased CYP7A1 basal expression, but the repressive effect of atRA persisted, suggesting there are also FXR/RXR-independent mechanisms mediating atRA repression of CYP7A1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and cell transfection results indicate that PGC-1alpha plays a role in the FXR/RXR-independent mechanism. Our findings may provide a potential explanation for hyperlipidemic side effects observed in some patients treated with high-dose RA.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) and HNF4alpha are liver-selective transcription factors and are essential for hepatocyte differentiation. This study demonstrates that HNF1alpha as well as HNF4alpha genes contain a direct repeat with a space of one nucleotide (DR1)-retinoic acid (RA) response element that can be bound and regulated by RA and retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRalpha) complex. Transient transfection experiments showed that RA increased the promoter activity of the HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes in Hep3B cells. Overexpression of RXRalpha further enhanced the activities of both genes. Two putative RXRalpha binding sites on the HNF1alpha (-295 to -276) and HNF4alpha (-418 to -399) genes have been characterized. By transient transfection, both sites positively responded to RA, and overexpression of RXRalpha in Hep3B cells increased the regulatory effect. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that these two DR-1 sites could be bound by RXRalpha specifically. These data suggest that the differentiation effect of RA on hepatocyte may be due to direct interaction of RXRalpha with the RA-responsive elements on the HNF1alpha and HNF4alpha genes.

Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (PPAR) are involved in cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of bile acids synthesis, composition, and reclamation. As ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) is thought to play a crucial role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, we investigated whether I-BABP gene expression could also be affected by PPAR. Indeed, treatment with the PPARalpha-PPARbeta/delta agonist bezafibrate led to the up-regulation of I-BABP mRNA levels in the human intestine-derived Caco-2 cells. Cotransfections of the reporter-linked human I-BABP promoter (hI-BABP-2769/+44) together with PPAR and RXR expression vectors demonstrated that the fibrate-mediated induction of the I-BABP gene is dependent on PPARalpha or PPARbeta/delta. Using progressive 5' deletions of the hI-BABP promoter and sequence analysis, we identified a putative PPAR-binding site located at the position -198 and -186 upstream of the transcription initiation site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the PPAR/RXR heterodimer can specifically bind to this PPRE-like motif. The deletion of the PPRE within the hI-BABP promoter abolished the PPAR-mediated transactivation in transient transfection assays. The regulation of the I-BABP promoter by PPAR appears species-specific, as the mouse I-BABP promoter, which lacks a conserved PPRE, was not responsive to exogenous PPAR expression in the presence of bezafibrate. Our findings show that the I-BABP gene may be a novel target for PPAR in humans and further emphasize the role for PPAR in the control of bile acid homeostasis.
The human multidrug resistance gene MDR3 encodes a P-glycoprotein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter family (ABCB4). MDR3 is a critical trans-locator for phospholipids across canalicular membranes of hepatocytes, evidenced by the fact that human MDR3 deficiencies result in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type III. It has been reported previously that MDR3 expression is modulated by hormones, cellular stress, and xenobiotics. Here we show that the MDR3 gene is trans-activated by the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) via a direct binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to a highly conserved inverted repeat element (a FXR response element) at the distal promoter (-1970 to -1958). In FXR trans-activation assays, both the endogenous FXR agonist chenodeoxycholate and the synthetic agonist GW4064 activated the MDR3 promoter. Deletion or mutation of this inverted repeat element abolished FXR-mediated MDR3 promoter activation. Consistent with these data, MDR3 mRNA was significantly induced by both chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 in primary human hepatocytes in time- and dose-dependent fashions. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MDR3 expression is directly up-regulated by FXR. These results, together with the previous report that the bile salt export pump is a direct FXR target, suggest that FXR coordinately controls secretion of bile salts and phospholipids. Results of this study further support the notion that FXR is a master regulator of lipid metabolism.
Phenobarbital (PB) increases hepatic drug/steroid-metabolic capability by coordinately activating transcription of the genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. The nuclear receptor CAR was first implicated as a transcription factor that activates the cytochrome P450 Cyp2b10 gene. In response to PB, CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to a PB response element (typified by DR-4 motif), and activates transcription of the gene. In the CAR-null mouse, PB does not only induce the Cyp2b10 gene, but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes. Thus, CAR is a general nuclear receptor that is essential for PB induction of drug/steroid metabolizing enzymes. PB also induces amino levulinate synthase 1 (ALAS-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis, to increase heme supply. However, PB induction of the synthase occurs in CAR-null mice, suggesting that CAR does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of drug/steroid metabolism.
It has been hypothesised, mainly from studies with animal models of liver disease, that the transport of substrates for metabolic enzymes and their subsequent metabolism and elimination in hepatic bile or blood is co-ordinated, but there is little information on this process in diseased human liver.
In this study we have measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) major genes involved in drug metabolism from UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B4) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) families (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4), transport (OATP-C, MRP2, MRP3, and MDR1) and major transcription factors (PXR, CAR, HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, RXR, and AHR) involved in their regulation. Liver biopsy tissue from patients with viral hepatitis was scored for inflammation and fibrosis by the METAVIR system, and separated into groups with mild (A0-1; F0-1, n = 20) or severe (A2-3; F3-4, n = 19) liver disease. Correlation analysis (Spearman rank-test, P &lt; 0.05) was used to identify metabolic enzymes and transporters which shared significant correlation with transcription factors.
Our results show an extensive correlation between transcription factors, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. An unexpected finding was that this was substantially greater in the severely diseased liver. Cross-talk between transcription factors was markedly increased in tissue from patients with severe liver disease, particularly between CAR, HNF4alpha, and PXR.
Our results support the hypothesis of co-ordinate regulation of metabolic enzymes and transporters in diseased human liver, as part of a widespread co-ordinated process under the control of nuclear receptor transcription factors.

Multidrug resistance-associated proteins 2-4 (MRP2-4) are membrane efflux transporters critical for the hepatic clearance of pharmaceuticals and endogenous chemicals. Little is known about the constitutive regulation of MRP2-4 mRNA in normal human liver. The purpose of this study was to identify transcription factors whose expression significantly correlates with MRP2-4 mRNA in human liver specimens. Ninety adult human livers were profiled for mRNA expression of MRP2-4 as well as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) and gamma (gamma), liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1 alpha) and 4 alpha (4 alpha), and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factors. Using linear regression and stepwise selection of partial R(2)-values, CAR, HNF1 alpha, and PPAR alpha mRNA exhibited the greatest correlation with MRP2, 3, and 4, respectively. Interindividual variation in the expression of the identified transcription factors may account for the variability in constitutive mRNA levels of MRP2-4. The multivariate approach presented in this study should aid in predicting signalling pathways that participate either directly or indirectly in regulating hepatic drug disposition.

Hepatobiliary transporters are down-regulated in toxic and cholestatic liver injury. Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) are attributed to mediate this regulation, but their particular contribution in vivo is still unknown. Thus, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which Ntcp, Oatp1, Oatp2, and Mrp2 are regulated by proinflammatory cytokines during liver injury. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with either carbon tetrachloride or endotoxin. Inactivation of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was achieved by repetitive intraperitoneal injection of etanercept and anakinra, respectively. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of transporters and binding activities as well as nuclear protein levels of Ntcp, Oatp2, and Mrp2 transactivators were determined 20 to 24 hours later. In contrast to IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha inactivation alone fully prevented down-regulation of Ntcp, Oatp1, and Oatp2 mRNA as well as reduced binding activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) in CCl(4)-induced toxic injury. In endotoxemia, down-regulation of Mrp2, and partially in case of Ntcp, could be prevented by IL-1 beta but not TNF-alpha blockade. However, inactivation of either cytokine led to preservation of HNF1 and partially of retinoid X receptor/retinoic acid receptor (RXR/RAR) binding activity. No effect of anticytokines was seen on pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) binding activity as well as nuclear protein mass. In conclusion, TNF-alpha represents the master cytokine responsible for HNF1-dependent down-regulation of Ntcp, Oatp1, and Oatp2 in CCl(4)-induced toxic liver injury. IL-1 beta predominates in a complex signaling network of Ntcp and Mrp2 regulation in cholestatic liver injury. In contrast to in vitro studies, HNF1 and RXR/RAR-independent mechanisms appear to be more important in regulation of Mrp2 and Ntcp gene expression in endotoxemia.
The multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) is a multispecific anion transporter that is capable of transporting a number of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. Expression of the MRP3 gene is increased during pathological states associated with elevated bile acid concentrations indicating a role for this transporter in adaptive and homeostatic bile acid metabolism. Analysis of Mrp3 mRNA levels in various mouse tissues with known relevance and/or exposure to bile acids revealed the highest levels of basal expression in the colon followed in order by the liver, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and kidney. Functional analysis of a murine Mrp3 promoter reporter construct revealed vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD3), 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), and the cholestatic secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). Using a series of deletion constructs combined with sequence analysis, a candidate VDR response element (VDRE) was identified between -1028 and -1014 bp of the Mrp3 promoter. Activation of the Mrp3 promoter in response to VD3, RA, or LCA, as well as binding of VDR/RXR heterodimers, was attenuated substantially by mutation of this VDRE. Treatment of mice with VD3 or LCA demonstrated in vivo modulation of the Mrp3 gene in colon but not in the liver. Reduction of endogenous VDR expression in colon adenocarcinoma MCA-38 cells by siRNA transfection was associated with reduced constitutive and inducible expression of the Mrp3 gene. These data support a regulatory role for the VDR in the protection of colon cells from bile acid toxicity through regulation of the Mrp3 expression.
L-Xylulose reductases belong to the superfamily of short chain dehydrogenases and reductases (SDRs) and catalyze the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolism. Here we report the identification of a novel L-xylulose reductase LXR3 in the fungus Trichoderma reesei by a bioinformatic approach in combination with a functional analysis. LXR3, a 31 kDa protein, catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol via NADPH and is also able to convert D-xylulose, D-ribulose, L-sorbose, and D-fructose to their corresponding polyols. Transcription of lxr3 is specifically induced by L-arabinose and L-arabitol. Deletion of lxr3 affects growth on L-arabinose and L-arabitol and reduces total NADPH-dependent LXR activity in cell free extracts. A phylogenetic analysis of known L-xylulose reductases shows that LXR3 is phylogenetically different from the Aspergillus niger L-xylulose reductase LxrA and, moreover, that all identified true L-xylulose reductases belong to different clades within the superfamily of SDRs. This indicates that the enzymes responsible for the reduction of L-xylulose in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolic pathways have evolved independently and that even the fungal LXRs of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway have evolved in different clades of the superfamily of SDRs.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). In vitro, HIV impairs monocyte-macrophage cholesterol efflux, a major determinant of circulating HDL-c, by increasing ABCA1 degradation, with compensatory upregulation of ABCA1 messenger RNA (mRNA).
We examined expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake, metabolism, and efflux in monocytes from 22 HIV-positive subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART-Treated), 30 untreated HIV-positive subjects (ART-Naive), and 22 HIV-negative controls (HIV-Neg).
HDL-c was lower and expression of ABCA1 mRNA was higher in ART-Naive subjects than in both ART-Treated and HIV-Neg subjects (both P &lt; .01), with HDL-c inversely correlated with HIV RNA (œÅ = -0.52; P &lt; .01). Expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake (LDLR, CD36), synthesis (HMGCR), and regulation (SREBP2, LXRA) was significantly lower in both ART-Treated and ART-Naive subjects than in HIV-Neg controls.
In vivo, increased monocyte ABCA1 expression in untreated HIV-infected patients and normalization of ABCA1 expression with virological suppression by ART supports direct HIV-induced impairment of cholesterol efflux previously demonstrated in vitro. However, decreased expression of cholesterol sensing, uptake, and synthesis genes in both untreated and treated HIV infection suggests that both HIV and ART affect monocyte cholesterol metabolism in a pattern consistent with accumulation of intramonocyte cholesterol.
To investigate the effects of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway on skeletal muscle development and energy metabolism, AG490 and IL-11 were used as agonist and inhibitor in treating mice and the mouse skeletal muscle cells. Average body weight (ABW) was reduced significantly in the mice treated with AG490 (p&lt;0.05), while IL-11 had the opposite effect (p&lt;0.05), as compared with the controls, average body temperature (ABT) remained at normal levels in both groups. Western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of JAK2, STAT3, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3. AG490 caused significant decreases in p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 (p&lt;0.05), while IL-11 did the opposite (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01). Quantitative RT-PCR also showed significantly decreased expression levels of Myf5, MyoD, LXRa, and UCP3 in the AG490 group (p&lt;0.01), but in the IL-11 group, the expression of Myf5, MyoD, and UCP3 was increased (p&lt;0.05), except that LXRa whose expression did not change. In cultured skeletal muscle cells, the expression of MyoD, Myf5, LXRa, and UCP3 (p&lt;0.05) exhibited the same trend as that in the skeletal muscles of both treated groups (p&lt;0.05). These results implicate the JAK2/STAT3 in skeletal muscle development and energy metabolism.
Secretion of cholesterol into bile is important for the elimination of cholesterol from the body. Thyroid hormone (TH) increases biliary cholesterol secretion and hepatic gene expression of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette, subfamily G (WHITE), member 5 (ABCG5) and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G (WHITE), member 8 (ABCG8), two half-transporters that act as a heterodimeric complex promoting sterol secretion. In addition, nuclear liver x receptor-alpha (LXRa), also regulated by TH, induces gene expression of ABCG5/G8. We here investigated if the TH-induced stimulation of biliary cholesterol secretion is mediated by the ABCG5/G8 complex in vivo, and if so, whether LXRa is involved. Mice homozygous for disruption of Abcg5 (Abcg5(-/-) ) or Lxra (Lxra(-/-) ) and their wild-type counterparts were treated with triiodothyronine (T3) for 14 days and compared to untreated mice of corresponding genetic backgrounds. Bile was collected by gallbladder cannulation, and liver samples were analyzed for gene expression levels. Basal biliary cholesterol secretion in Abcg5(-/-) mice was 72% lower than in Abcg5(+/+) mice. T3 treatment increased cholesterol secretion 3.1-fold in Abcg5(+/+) mice, whereas this response was severely blunted in Abcg5(-/-) mice. In contrast, biliary cholesterol secretion in T3-treated Lxra(+/+) and Lxra(-/-) mice was increased 3.5- and 2.6-fold, respectively, and did not differ significantly.
TH-induced secretion of cholesterol into bile is largely dependent on an intact ABCG5/G8 transporter complex, whereas LXRa is not critical for this effect.
Our goal was to determine whether genetic variation at genes affecting statin metabolism or targets of statin therapy would influence low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering with pravastatin, baseline heart disease, or cardiac endpoints on trial. We examined associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the liver X receptor alpha (LXRA, rs12221497), and the solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO1B1, rs4149056 and rs2306283) gene loci with these variables. We studied 5411 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for a mean of 3.2 years. No relationships between genetic variation at the LXRA gene locus with statin induced LDL lowering response or other parameters were noted. Both the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (valine for alanine at 174) and the rs2306283 (asparagine for aspartic acid at 130) SNPs affect the amino acid sequence of the SLCO1B1 gene product. No effect of the rs2306283 SNP on any of the variables was noted. However the presence of the rs4149056 SNP was associated with significantly less LDL cholesterol lowering response to pravastatin (wildtype, 71.5% of the population, -37.0%; heterozygotes, 25.8% of the population, -36.0%; and homozygotes, 2.7% of the population, -31.8%, p=0.003 at 6 months, and p=0.022 at 12 months). Our data indicate that the presence of the rs4149056 non-synonymous SNP at the SLCO1B1 gene locus can significantly decrease the pravastatin induced LDL cholesterol lowering response.
Menopause is associated with changes in lipid levels resulting in increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Hormone therapy (HT) and atorvastatin have been used to improve lipid profile in postmenopausal women. Effects of HT, atorvastatin and APOE polymorphisms on serum lipids and APOE and LXRA expression were evaluated in 87 hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women, randomly selected for treatment with atorvastatin (AT, n=17), estrogen or estrogen plus progestagen (HT, n=34) and estrogen or estrogen plus progestagen associated with atorvastatin (HT+AT, n=36). RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mRNA expression was measured by TaqMan(¬Æ) PCR. APOE …õ2/…õ3/…õ4 genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-c and apoB were reduced after each treatment (p&lt;0.001). Triglycerides, VLDL-c and apoAI were reduced only after atorvastatin (p&lt;0.05), whereas triglycerides and VLDL-c were increased after HT (p=0.01). HT women had lower reduction on TC, LDL-c and apoB than AT and HT+AT groups (p&lt;0.05). APOE mRNA expression was reduced after atorvastatin treatment (p=0.03). Although LXRA gene expression was not modified by atorvastatin, it was correlated with APOE mRNA before and after treatments. Basal APOE mRNA expression was not influenced by gene polymorphisms, however the reduction on APOE expression was more pronounced in …õ3…õ3 than in …õ3…õ4 carriers. Atorvastatin down-regulates APOE mRNA expression and it is modified by APOE genotypes in PBMC from postmenopausal women.
Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are surface active fluorochemicals that, due to their exceptional stability to degradation, are persistent in the environment. Both PFOA and PFOS are eliminated slowly in humans, with geometric mean serum elimination half-lives estimated at 3.5 and 4.8 years, respectively. The biological activity of PFOA and PFOS in rodents is attributed primarily to transactivation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA), which is an important regulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. However, there are significant species-specific differences in the response to PFOA and PFOS exposure; non-rodent species, including humans, are refractory to several but not all of these effects. Many of the metabolic effects have been attributed to the activation of PPARA; however, recent studies using PPARŒ± knockout mice demonstrate residual PPARA-independent effects, some of which may involve the activation of alternate nuclear receptors, including NR1I2 (PXR), NR1I3 (CAR), NR1H3 (LXRA), and NR1H4 (FXR). The objective of this investigation was to characterize the activation of multiple nuclear receptors and modulation of metabolic pathways associated with exposure to PFOA and PFOS, and to compare and contrast the effects between rat and human primary liver cells using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Our results demonstrate that multiple nuclear receptors participate in the metabolic response to PFOA and PFOS exposure resulting in a substantial shift from carbohydrate metabolism to fatty acid oxidation and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in rat liver cells. This shift in intermediary metabolism was more pronounced for PFOA than PFOS. Furthermore, while there is some similarity in the activation of metabolic pathways between rat and humans, particularly in PPARA regulated responses; the changes in primary human cells were more subtle and possibly reflect an adaptive metabolic response rather than an overt metabolic regulation observed in rodents.
To use microarray analyses of gene expression to characterize the synovial molecular pathways regulated by the arthritis regulatory locus Cia25 and to determine how it operates to control disease severity and joint damage.
Synovial tissues from DA rats and DA.ACI(Cia25) rats obtained 21 days after induction of pristane-induced arthritis were used for RNA extraction and hybridization to Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChips (22,228 genes). Genes with a P value‚â§0.01 and a fold difference in expression‚â•1.5 between DA rats and DA.ACI(Cia25) rats were considered significant.
Interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤) (7.4-fold), IL-6 (67-fold), Ccl2, Cxcl10, Mmp3, Mmp14, and innate immunity genes were expressed at increased levels in DA rats and at significantly lower levels in DA.ACI(Cia25) congenic rats. DA.ACI(Cia25) rats had increased expression of 10 nuclear receptor (NR) genes, including those known to interfere with NF-Œ∫B activity and cytokine expression, such as Lxra, Pparg, and Rxrg. DA.ACI(Cia25) rats also had increased expression of NR targets, suggesting increased NR activity. While Vdr was not differentially expressed, a Vdr expression signature was detected in congenic rats, along with up-regulation of mediators of vitamin D synthesis.
This is the first description of the association between increased synovial levels of NRs and arthritis protection. The expression of NRs was inversely correlated with the expression of key mediators of arthritis, suggesting reciprocally opposing effects either via NF-Œ∫B or at the genomic level in the synovial tissue. We consider that the NR signature may have an important role in maintaining synovial homeostasis and an inflammation-free tissue. These processes are regulated by the Cia25 gene and suggest a new function for this gene.
Liver X receptor-Œ± (LXRA) is a nuclear receptor that regulates genes important in cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LXRA gene (NR1H3) have been earlier associated with metabolic phenotypes (dyslipidemia and elevated body mass index). Metabolic dysregulation is a major contributor to coronary disease; therefore, we assessed LXRA in International Verapamil Sustained Release SR Trandolapril Study Genetic Substudy (INVEST-GENES), a genetic-substudy of a large clinical trial in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease.
Seven tag SNPs in the LXRA gene region (NR1H3) were selected for study: rs11039149, rs12221497, rs2279238, rs7120118, rs326213, rs11039159, and rs10501321. One thousand fifty-nine patients were genotyped from the INVEST-GENES case-control set (verapamil-sustained release-based or atenolol-based treatment strategies) that comprised of 297 cases frequency matched (approximately 2.5:1) with that of event-free controls by sex and race. The primary outcome was defined as first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression.
Three of the seven SNPs were associated with significant effects on the primary outcome in nonBlacks. The variant G allele of rs11039149 and the variant A allele of rs12221497 were associated with reduced risk of experiencing the primary outcome [OR: 0.62, confidence interval (CI): 0.45-0.85, P=0.003 and OR: 0.60, CI: 0.39-0.91, P=0.016, respectively]. The rs2279238 genotype was associated with a significant increase in risk for the primary outcome (OR: 1.42, CI: 1.03-1.95, P=0.03). Furthermore, there was a significant genotype-treatment strategy interaction for carriers of the variant T allele of rs2279238 (OR for verapamil-sustained release strategy compared with atenolol strategy: 2.86, CI: 1.50-5.46, P=0.0015). Diplotype analyses showed that the SNPs are rarely coinherited and support the directionally opposite effects of the SNPs on the primary outcome.
LXRA genotypes were associated with variable risk for cardiovascular outcomes and pharmacogenetic effect in INVEST-GENES. These novel findings suggest that LXRA is a genetic/pharmacogenetic target that should be further explored.
Anthocyanins, which are found in some food, including Thai black sticky rice, are reported to have health-promoting properties. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases induced by free radicals, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer. We evaluated the anthocyanin-rich extract (ARE) from Thai black sticky rice for antioxidative and antihyperlipidemic effects on HepG2 cells. Cell viability was investigated with the neutral red assay and the MTT assay, and oxidative stress was determined by the DCFH-DA assay. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the effect of ARE on LDLR, HMG-CoAR, PPAR (Œ±1,Œ≥) and LXRa gene expression. We found that ARE at high doses (‚â• 800 mg/L) induces cytotoxicity. However, at 600-1000 mg/L it reduced intracellular oxidative stress (P &lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner, and at 200 mg/L it significantly enhanced the expression of the LDLR gene in HepG2 cells. We concluded that ARE can be beneficial for health promotion by reducing oxidative stress and enhancing LDL clearance, regulating LDLR production on the cell surface membrane, thereby maintaining lipid homeostasis.
The differentiation of fibroblast-like pre-adipocytes to lipid-loaded adipocytes is regulated by a network of transcription factors, the most prominent one being the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Œ≥. However, many of the other 47 members of the nuclear receptor superfamily have an impact on adipogenesis, which in human cells has not been investigated in detail.
We analyzed by quantitative PCR all human nuclear receptors at multiple time points during differentiation of SGBS pre-adipocytes. The earliest effect was the down-regulation of the genes RARG, PPARD, REV-ERBA, REV-ERBB, VDR and GR followed by the up-regulation of PPARG, LXRA and AR. These observations are supported with data from 3T3-L1 mouse pre-adipocytes and primary human adipocytes. Investigation of the effects of the individual differentiation mix components in short-term treatments and of their omission from the full mix showed that the expression levels of the early-regulated nuclear receptor genes were most affected by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand cortisol and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. Interestingly, the effects of both compounds converged to repress the genes PPARD, REV-ERBA, REV-ERBB, VDR and GR, whereas cortisol and IBMX showed antagonistic interaction for PPARG, LXRA and AR causing a time lag in their up-regulation. We hypothesize that the well-known auto-repression of GR fine-tunes the detected early responses. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that GR association increased on the transcription start sites of the genes RARG, REV-ERBB, VDR and GR.
Adipocyte differentiation is a process, in which many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily change their mRNA expression. The actions of cortisol and IBMX converged to repress several nuclear receptors early in differentiation, while up-regulation of other nuclear receptor genes showed a time lag due to antagonisms of the signals. Our results place GR and its ligand cortisol as central regulatory factors controlling early regulatory events in human adipogenesis that precedes the regulation of the later events by PPARG.
GSD-1 (glycogen storage disease type 1) is caused by an inherited defect in glucose-6-phosphatase activity, resulting in a massive accumulation of hepatic glycogen content and an induction of de novo lipogenesis. The chlorogenic acid derivative S4048 is a pharmacological inhibitor of the glucose 6-phosphate transporter, which is part of glucose-6-phosphatase, and allows for mechanistic studies concerning metabolic defects in GSD-1. Treatment of mice with S4048 resulted in an ~60% reduction in blood glucose, increased hepatic glycogen and triacylglycerol (triglyceride) content, and a markedly enhanced hepatic lipogenic gene expression. In mammals, hepatic expression of lipogenic genes is regulated by the co-ordinated action of the transcription factors SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1c, LXRŒ± (liver X receptor Œ±) and ChREBP (carbohydrate-response-element-binding protein). Treatment of Lxra-/- mice and Chrebp-/- mice with S4048 demonstrated that ChREBP, but not LXRŒ±, mediates the induction of hepatic lipogenic gene expression in this murine model of GSD-1. Thus ChREBP is an attractive target to alleviate derangements in lipid metabolism observed in patients with GSD-1.
The Liver X receptors (LXR) alpha and beta and their target genes such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have been shown to be crucially involved in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of LXR alpha/beta in the human placenta under normal physiological circumstances and in preeclampsia.
We investigated the expression pattern of the LXRs and their target genes in the human placenta during normal pregnancy and in preeclampsia. Placental explants and cell lines were studied under different oxygen levels and pharmacological LXR agonists.
Gene expressions (Taqman PCR) and protein levels (Western Blot) were combined with immunohistochemistry to analyze the expression of LXR and its target genes.
In the human placenta, LXRA and LXRB expression increased during normal pregnancy. This was paralleled by the expression of their prototypical target genes, e.g., the cholesterol transporter ABCA1. Interestingly, early-onset preeclamptic placentae revealed a significant upregulation of ABCA1. Culture of JAr trophoblast cells and human first trimester placental explants under low oxygen lead to increased expression of LXRA and ABCA1 which was further enhanced by the LXR agonist T0901317.
LXRA together with ABCA1 are specifically expressed in the human placenta and can be regulated by hypoxia. Deregulation of this system in early preeclampsia might be the result of placental hypoxia and hence might have consequences for maternal-fetal cholesterol transport.
L-Xylulose reductase is part of the eukaryotic pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A previously identified L-xylulose reductase in Hypocrea jecorina turned out to be not the 'true' one since it was not upregulated during growth on L-arabinose and the deletion strain showed no reduced L-xylulose reductase activity but instead lost the D-mannitol dehydrogenase activity. In this communication we identified the 'TRUE'L-xylulose reductase in Aspergillus niger. The gene, lxrA (JGI177736), is upregulated on L-arabinose and the deletion results in a strain lacking the NADPH-specific L-xylulose reductase activity and having reduced growth on l-arabinose. The purified enzyme had a K(m) for L-xylulose of 25 mM and a nu(max) of 650 U/mg.
Prenatal nutrition as influenced by the nutritional status of the mother has been identified as a determinant of adult disease. Feeding low-protein diets during pregnancy in rodents is a well-established model to induce programming events in offspring. We hypothesized that protein restriction would influence fetal lipid metabolism by inducing epigenetic adaptations. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a protein-restriction protocol (9% vs. 18% casein). Shortly before birth, dams and fetuses were killed. To identify putative epigenetic changes, CG-dinucleotide-rich region in the promoter of a gene (CpG island) methylation microarrays were performed on DNA isolated from fetal livers. Two hundred four gene promoter regions were differentially methylated upon protein restriction. The liver X-receptor (Lxr) alpha promoter was hypermethylated in protein-restricted pups. Lxr alpha is a nuclear receptor critically involved in control of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. The mRNA level of Lxra was reduced by 32% in fetal liver upon maternal protein restriction, whereas expression of the Lxr target genes Abcg5/Abcg8 was reduced by 56% and 51%, respectively, measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The same effect, although less pronounced, was observed in the fetal intestine. In vitro methylation of a mouse Lxra-promoter/luciferase expression cassette resulted in a 24-fold transcriptional repression. Our study demonstrates that, in mice, protein restriction during pregnancy interferes with DNA methylation in fetal liver. Lxra is a target of differential methylation, and Lxra transcription is dependent on DNA methylation. It is tempting to speculate that perinatal nutrition may influence adult lipid metabolism by DNA methylation, which may contribute to the epidemiological relation between perinatal/neonatal nutrition and adult disease.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are key regulators of macrophage function, controlling transcriptional programs involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. However, exactly how LXRs modulate inflammation during infection remains unknown. To explore this, we used a mouse model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Upon intratracheal infection with M. tuberculosis, LXRs and LXR target genes were induced in CD11c+ lung and alveolar cells. Furthermore, mice deficient in both LXR isoforms, LXRalpha and LXRbeta (Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- mice), were more susceptible to infection, developing higher bacterial burdens and an increase in the size and number of granulomatous lesions. Interestingly, mice solely deficient in LXRalpha, but not those lacking only LXRbeta, mirrored the susceptibility of the Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- animals. Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- mice failed to mount an effective early neutrophilic airway response to infection and showed dysregulation of both pro- and antiinflammatory factors in CD11c+ lung cells. T cell responses were strongly affected in Lxra-/-Lxrb-/- mice, showing near-complete abrogation of the infection-induced Th1 function - and even more so Th17 function - in the lungs. Treatment of WT mice with the LXR agonists TO901317 and GW3965 resulted in a 10-fold decrease of the pulmonary bacterial burden and a comparable increase of Th1/Th17 function in the lungs. The dependence of LXR signaling on the neutrophil IL-17 axis represents what we believe to be a novel function for these nuclear receptors in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection and may provide a new target for therapeutics.
Liver X receptor alpha (LXRA) and beta (LXRB) regulate glucose and lipid homeostasis in model systems but their importance in human physiology is poorly understood. This project aimed to determine whether common genetic variations in LXRA and LXRB associate with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and quantitative measures of glucose homeostasis, and, if so, reveal the underlying mechanisms.
Eight common single nucleotide polymorphisms in LXRA and LXRB were analyzed for association with T2D in one French cohort (N = 988 cases and 941 controls), and for association with quantitative measures reflecting glucose homeostasis in two non-diabetic population-based samples comprising N = 697 and N = 1344 adults. Investigated quantitative phenotypes included fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin, and HOMAIR as measure of overall insulin resistance. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed in N = 1344 of adults. The two alleles of the proximal LXRB promoter, differing only at the SNP rs17373080, were cloned into reporter vectors and transiently transfected, whereupon allele-specific luciferase activity was measured. rs17373080 overlapped, according to in silico analysis, with a binding site for Nuclear factor 1 (NF1). Promoter alleles were tested for interaction with NF1 using direct DNA binding and transactivation assays.
Genotypes at two LXRB promoter SNPs, rs35463555 and rs17373080, associated nominally with T2D (P values 0.047 and 0.026). No LXRA or LXRB SNP associated with quantitative measures reflecting glucose homeostasis. The rs17373080 C allele displayed higher basal transcription activity (P value &lt; 0.05). The DNA-mobility shift assay indicated that oligonucleotides corresponding to either rs17373080 allele bound NF1 transcription factors in whole cell extracts to the same extent. Different NF1 family members showed different capacity to transactivate the LXRB gene promoter, but there was no difference between promoter alleles in NF1 induced transactivation activity.
Variations in the LXRB gene promoter may be part of the aetiology of T2D. However, the association between LXRB rs35463555 and rs17373080, and T2D are preliminary and needs to be investigated in additional larger cohorts. Common genetic variation in LXRA is unlikely to affect the risk of developing T2D or quantitative phenotypes related to glucose homeostasis.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of longitudinal birth cohorts enable joint investigation of environmental and genetic influences on complex traits. We report GWAS results for nine quantitative metabolic traits (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966), drawn from the most genetically isolated Finnish regions. We replicate most previously reported associations for these traits and identify nine new associations, several of which highlight genes with metabolic functions: high-density lipoprotein with NR1H3 (LXRA), low-density lipoprotein with AR and FADS1-FADS2, glucose with MTNR1B, and insulin with PANK1. Two of these new associations emerged after adjustment of results for body mass index. Gene-environment interaction analyses suggested additional associations, which will require validation in larger samples. The currently identified loci, together with quantified environmental exposures, explain little of the trait variation in NFBC1966. The association observed between low-density lipoprotein and an infrequent variant in AR suggests the potential of such a cohort for identifying associations with both common, low-impact and rarer, high-impact quantitative trait loci.
The realization of optimized therapeutic delivery is impaired by the challenge of localized drug activity and by the dangers of systemic cytotoxicity which often contribute to patient treatment complications. Here we demonstrate the block copolymer-mediated deposition and release of multiple therapeutics which include an LXRŒ±/Œ≤ agonist 3-((4-methoxyphenyl)amino)-4-phenyl-1-(phenylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (LXRa) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) at the air-water interface via Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, as well as copolymer-mediated potent drug elution toward the Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cell line. The resultant copolymer-therapeutic hybrid serves as a localized platform that can be functionalized with virtually any drug due to the integrated hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of the polymer structure. In addition, the sequestering function of the copolymer to anchor the drugs to implant surfaces can enhance delivery specificity when compared to systemic drug administration. Confirmation of drug functionality was confirmed via suppression of the interleukin 6 (Il-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±) inflammatory cytokines (LXRa), as well as DNA fragmentation analysis (Dox). Furthermore, the fragmentation assays and gene expression analysis demonstrated the innate biocompatibility of the copolymeric material at the gene expression level via the confirmed absence of material-induced apoptosis and a lack of inflammatory gene expression. This modality enables layer-by-layer control of agonist and chemotherapeutic functionalization at the nanoscale for the localization of drug dosage, while simultaneously utilizing the copolymer platform as an anchoring mechanism for drug sequestering, all with an innate material thickness of 4¬†nm per layer, which is orders of magnitude thinner than existing commercial technologies. Furthermore, these studies comprehensively confirmed the potential translational applicability of copolymeric nanomaterials as localized multitherapeutic thin film platforms.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are activated by oxysterols and intermediates in the cholesterol synthetic pathway. The pivotal role of LXRs in the metabolic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids has been well established. Furthermore, insulin induces LXRa in hepatocytes, resulting in the suppression of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). LXRs also play an important role in fatty acid metabolism by activating the sterol regulatory element-bing protein 1c gene (SREBP1c). This articles reviews the molecular mechanisms by which LXRs act to influence the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.
LXRA and LXRB genes regulate adiposity, energy dissipation, as well as glucose and lipid homeostasis in mice. We investigated the LXR genes in human obesity.
LXRA and LXRB mRNAs were quantified in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and nonobese women. The LXRA and LXRB genes were screened for polymorphisms and common single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in obese and nonobese women.
Relative LXRA mRNA expression levels were higher in obese women (P=0.03). One LXRA single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2279238, and one common haplotype, CAAGCC, as well as two LXRB single nucleotide polymorphisms, LB44732G&gt;A and rs2695121, were associated with obesity phenotypes (nominal P values of 0.0075, 0.0014, 0.008 and 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, there was evidence of interaction between LXRA and LXRB alleles in determining body mass index.
Our results support a role for LXRA in human adipose tissue. The nominal associations of LXRA and LXRB alleles with obesity are interesting and should be further investigated in independent data sets.
Genetic susceptibility in the causation of gallbladder diseases was recognized as early as 1937. A major gallstone susceptibility locus (Lith1) was identified in 1995 by quantitative trait locus mapping in mice. Two attractive positional and functional candidate genes in LXRA and ABCB11 are located in this interval. ABCB11 is associated with progressive familial cholestasis. This study was undertaken to investigate LXRA and ABCB11 as candidate genes for gallstone disease in humans. Eight hundred and ten patients who underwent cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease (median age of onset, 50 years) were compared with 718 sex-matched control individuals. Control individuals were sonographically free of gallstones. Haplotype tagging and all known coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for ABCB11 (n=29) and LXRA (n=10). The investigated high-risk patient sample provides a power of greater than 80% for the detection of odds ratios down to 1.55. No evidence of association of the two genes in the single point tagging markers, coding variants or in the sliding window haplotype analysis was detected (all nominal single-point P values&gt;or=.08). In conclusion, in the investigated German sample, no evidence of association of ABCB11 and LXRA to gallstone susceptibility was detected. The gallstone trait is not allelic to progressive familial cholestasis at the ABCB11 locus. Systematic fine mapping of the Lith1 region is required to identify the causative genetic variants for gallstone in mice and humans.
Cholesterol precursors act as activators of the nuclear hormone receptor, liver X receptor (LXR). One of these LXR-activating ligands is meiosis activating sterol (MAS), which also induces resumption of meiosis in oocytes from mice in vitro. Whether LXR participates in the regulation of oocyte maturation and whether the expression of either one of the two paralogues of LXR (alpha and beta) affect fertility of mice has, however, not yet been clarified. Female mice lacking Lxra, Lxrb or both genes (Lxra(-/-), Lxrb(-/-) and Lxrab(-/-), respectively) conceive less frequently and have significantly fewer pups per litter as compared to wild type mice. Both Lxra and Lxrb mRNA were found to be expressed in mouse oocytes. The relative expression of, in particular, Lxrb was almost two orders of magnitude higher than in liver, brain and testis. A water-soluble LXR agonist caused naked oocytes, but not cumulus enclosed oocytes (CEO), from wild type mice to resume meiosis significantly more often than control oocytes. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a potent stimulator of meiosis in CEO from wild type mice, but was without effect in mice lacking both Lxr genes. Zymosterol, a MAS active substance, induced resumption of meiosis in oocytes from Lxrab(-/-) mice, but significantly less effectively than in oocytes from wild type mice. Taken together, LXRs seem to affect ovarian function, suggesting specific roles of cholesterol precursors in regulation of female reproduction.
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 heterodimerize into a functional complex that mediates the secretion of plant sterols and cholesterol by hepatocytes into bile and their apical efflux from enterocytes. We addressed the putative rate-controlling role of Abcg5/Abcg8 in hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion in mice during (maximal) stimulation of this process. Despite similar bile salt (BS) excretion rates, basal total sterol and phospholipid (PL) output rates were reduced by 82% and 35%, respectively, in chow-fed Abcg5(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. When mice were infused with the hydrophilic BS tauroursodeoxycholate, similar relative increases in bile flow, BS output, PL output, and total sterol output were observed in wild-type, Abcg5(+/-), and Abcg5(-/-) mice. Maximal cholesterol and PL output rates in Abcg5(-/-) mice were only 15% and 69%, respectively, of wild-type values. An infusion of increasing amounts of the hydrophobic BS taurodeoxycholate increased cholesterol excretion by 3.0- and 2.4-fold in wild-type and Abcg5(-/-) mice but rapidly induced cholestasis in Abcg5(-/-) mice. Treatment with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 increased the maximal sterol excretion capacity in wild-type mice (fourfold), concomitant with the induction of Abcg5/Abcg8 expression, but not in Abcg5(-/-) mice. In a separate study, mice were fed chow containing 1% (wt/wt) cholesterol. As expected, hepatic expression of Abcg5 and Abcg8 was strongly induced (fivefold and fourfold) in wild-type but not LXR-alpha-deficient (Lxra(-/-)) mice. Surprisingly, hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion was increased to the same extent, i.e., 2.2-fold in wild-type mice and 2.0-fold in Lxra(-/-) mice, upon cholesterol feeding. Our data confirm that Abcg5, as part of the Abcg5/Abcg8 heterodimer, strongly controls hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion in mice. However, our data demonstrate that Abcg5/Abcg8 heterodimer-independent, inducible routes exist that can significantly contribute to total hepatobiliary cholesterol output.
Liver X receptor alpha (LXRA) and beta (LXRB) are members of the nuclear receptor subfamily and are important regulators of genes involved in lipid, fatty acid and glucose metabolism in liver, and adipose tissue as well as in skeletal muscle. To investigate whether the two LXR genes play a role in influencing lean and fat growth in pigs, we discovered and examined two polymorphisms in LXRA (LXRA Bsl in exon 2, and LXRA HpyCH4 III in intron 8) and one polymorphism in LXRB (LXRB Aci I in exon 5) for genetic linkage and association analyses. Linkage analyses using a three-generation resource family of a cross between the Berkshire and Yorkshire (BY) pig breeds assigned LXRA to SSC2 and LXRB to SSC6. Association analyses were carried out among those polymorphisms and traits evaluated in the BY F(2) family and four pig commercial populations. These analyses indicated that the LXRA HpyCH4 III polymorphism was significantly associated with loin eye area and total lipid in individuals from the BY family. Significant associations were also found between Bsl I polymorphism in LXRA and boneless loin (%), as well as marbling score in one commercial line. The LXRB Aci I polymorphism was significantly associated with lean meat and fat content in the BY family and a number of the commercial lines examined. Our current findings suggested that LXRA and LXRB might have potential effects, especially for loin lean and fat content.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by accumulation of neutral lipids in hepatocytes leading to micro and macro-vesicular steatosis and balloon cell degeneration. Hypercaloric alimentation and resultant obesity also cause similar changes as evident in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes is a pathologic hallmark of ALD and NAFLD. In contrast, quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are characterized by the intracellular content of not only vitamin A but also triglycerides, and HSC activation is associated with depletion of these lipids. In fact, our recent work demonstrates that adipogenic/ lipogenic transcriptional regulation rendered by PPARgamma, LXRa, and SREBP-1c is essential for the maintenance of the fat-storing, quiescence phenotype of HSC. Expression of these adipogenic transcription factors is lost in activated HSC and the treatment of the cells with the adipocyte differentiation cocktail or ectopic expression of PPARgamma or SREBP-1c causes a reversal of activated cells to the quiescent phenotype. In steatotic livers from ALD and NAFLD mouse models, the expression of these adipogenic transcription factors is induced while the normal control livers lack such expression. Thus, adipogenic regulation is essential for HSC quiescence while it makes hepatocytes steatotic. Interestingly, under the adipogenic conditions of ALD and NAFLD, HSC are still activated to cause fibrosis. This fat paradox in hepatocytes and HSC highlights contrasted significance of fat in these two cell types that depend on each other for their homeostatic control. It further suggests, activated HSC in steatotic livers may have defective insulin signaling or lipogenic regulation.
Fibrates are widely used hypolipidemic agents that activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARalpha) and regulate the expression of many genes involved in lipid metabolism. We studied the mechanism of the effect of clofibrate on cholesterol homeostasis. Rats were fed with chow containing clofibrate, cytochrome P-450 inhibitor ketoconazole, or clofibrate plus ketoconazole. Control rats were fed only with normal chow. The levels of six oxysterols in liver microsome were determined. The levels of mRNAs for liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), PPARalpha and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A) in the liver were analyzed by northern blotting. Clofibrate administration decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride and increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Clofibrate increased the levels of liver microsomal oxysterols including 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, which are potent activators of LXRalpha. Clofibrate also enhanced the expression of mRNAs for PPARalpha, LXRalpha, and ABCA1. Simultaneous administration of ketoconazole suppressed the effects of clofibrate on plasma lipids, hepatic oxysterol levels, and the expression of the genes. Clofibrate increases cytochrome P450 content and the resulting oxysterol generation may partly mediate the clofibrate-induced up-regulattion of LXRa and ABCA1, which are related to reverse cholesterol transport.
In order to identify changes in the gene expression profile during human monocyte/macrophage differentiation in the presence of GM-CSF, the expression level of various mRNA was studied using DNA microarray technology. We found LXR alpha (LXRa) to be the most highly induced transcriptional regulator during macrophage differentiation. The LXRa mRNA level was induced 40 fold which ranked it as the 10th highest among the approximately 5,600 genes studied. Although only restricted hepatic expression of LXRa mRNA had been reported, the macrophage expressed the highest level of LXRa among the nine human tissues and cultured cells studied. To further investigate transcriptional control, we have characterized the genomic structure of the human LXRa gene and determined the structure of its promoter region. The human LXRa gene consists of eleven exons, and analysis of the promoter region indicated the presence of conserved binding sites for myeloid zinc finger protein 1, which may be related to the extrahepatic expression of LXRa. LXRa is known to be activated by oxysterols, and the induced expression of the gene may be related to the foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions.
Treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leads to enhanced bone turnover and accelerated bone loss in premenopausal women with endometriosis, uterine leiomyomatomas and hirsutism. Sodium etidronate is a powerful inhibitor of bone resorption which had been proven efficacious in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the skeletal effects of 6 months of therapy with the depot preparation of the GnRH agonist triptorelin (decapeptil 3.75 mg intramuscularly every 4 weeks) in 24 hirsute patients, aged 24-33 years, with hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation. Ten patients also received cyclical etidronate in an oral dose of 400 mg/day for 2 weeks, followed by an 11-week period of 500 mg/day elemental oral calcium (one cycle). The remaining 14 patients received 500 mg/day of elemental calcium continuously. After 6 months all treatments were discontinued for at least a further 6 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine and hip (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Sophos LXRA, France) and biochemical markers (serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, urinary N-telopeptide and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio) were evaluated at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. In the group given GnRH agonist alone BMD fell significantly at all measured skeletal sites during the first 6 months. In the patients treated with etidronate a significant decrease in BMD was observed at lumbar spine but not in the femoral neck and trochanter, and the changes at lumbar spine and trochanter were significantly smaller than those in the control group. At 6 months bone turnover was also increased in patients treated with GnRH and calcium. Cyclical etidronate prevented the increase in biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption, with the exception of calcium/creatinine excretion, which was significantly increased in both groups. Six months after treatment withdrawal BMD did not recover in either group. Biochemical markers (N-telopeptide, serum alkaline phosphatase) remained increased in those patients previously treated with calcium alone while they remained close to baseline values in the patients treated with cyclical etidronate. Our study indicates that: (1) GnRH agonist therapy causes remarkable bone loss in young individuals with androgen excess who are expected to have increased bone mass; (2) this bone loss can be partially prevented by intermittent cyclical etidronate therapy.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease characterized by myelin loss and neuronal dysfunction. Despite the aggregation observed in some families, pathogenic mutations have remained elusive. In this study, we describe the identification of NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln in seven MS patients from two multi-incident families presenting severe and progressive disease, with an average age at onset of 34 years. Additionally, association analysis of common variants in NR1H3 identified rs2279238 conferring a 1.35-fold increased risk of developing progressive MS. The p.Arg415Gln position is highly conserved in orthologs and paralogs, and disrupts NR1H3 heterodimerization and transcriptional activation of target genes. Protein expression analysis revealed that mutant NR1H3 (LXRA) alters gene expression profiles, suggesting a disruption in transcriptional regulation as one of the mechanisms underlying MS pathogenesis. Our study indicates that pharmacological activation of LXRA or its targets may lead to effective treatments for the highly debilitating and currently untreatable progressive phase of MS.
The microRNA-26 (miR-26) family is known to control adipogenesis in non-ruminants. The genomic loci of miR-26a and miR-26b have been localized in the introns of genes encoding for the proteins of the C-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase (CTDSP) family. Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) encodes a protein with a key role in the regulation of lipogenesis in rodent liver. In the present study, we investigated the synergistic function of the miR-26 family and their host genes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). Downregulation of miR-26a/b and their host genes in GMEC decreased the expression of genes relate to fatty acid synthesis (PPARG, LXRA, SREBF1, FASN, ACACA, GPAM, LPIN1, DGAT1 and SCD1), triacylglycerol accumulation and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed INSIG1 as a direct target of miR-26a/b. Furthermore, inhibition of the CTDSP family also downregulated the expression of INSIG1. Taken together, our findings highlight a functional association of miR-26a/b, their host genes and INSIG1, and provide new insights into the regulatory network controlling milk fat synthesis in GMEC. The data indicate that targeting this network via nutrition might be important for regulating milk fat synthesis in ruminants.
Fish currently supplies only 40% of the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) required to allow all individuals globally to meet the minimum intake recommendation of 500 mg/d. Therefore, alternative sustainable sources are needed.
The main objective was to investigate the ability of genetically engineered Camelina sativa (20% EPA) oil (CO) to enrich tissue EPA and DHA relative to an EPA-rich fish oil (FO) in mammals.
Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 10 wk either a palm oil-containing control (C) diet or diets supplemented with EPA-CO or FO, with the C, low-EPA CO (COL), high-EPA CO (COH), low-EPA FO (FOL), and high-EPA FO (FOH) diets providing 0, 0.4, 3.4, 0.3, and 2.9 g EPA/kg diet, respectively. Liver, muscle, and brain were collected for fatty acid analysis, and blood glucose and serum lipids were quantified. The expression of selected hepatic genes involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis and in modulating their cellular impact was determined.
The oils were well tolerated, with significantly greater weight gain in the COH and FOH groups relative to the C group (P &lt; 0.001). Significantly lower (36-38%) blood glucose concentrations were evident in the FOH and COH mice relative to C mice (P &lt; 0.01). Hepatic EPA concentrations were higher in all EPA groups relative to the C group (P &lt; 0.001), with concentrations of 0.0, 0.4, 2.9, 0.2, and 3.6 g/100 g liver total lipids in the C, COL, COH, FOL, and FOH groups, respectively. Comparable dose-independent enrichments of liver DHA were observed in mice fed CO and FO diets (P &lt; 0.001). Relative to the C group, lower fatty acid desaturase 1 (Fads1) expression (P &lt; 0.005) was observed in the COH and FOH groups. Higher fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ± (Ppara), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (Pparg) (P &lt; 0.005) expressions were induced by CO. No impact of treatment on liver X receptor Œ± (Lxra) or sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (Srebp1c) was evident.
Oil from transgenic Camelina is a bioavailable source of EPA in mice. These data provide support for the future assessment of this oil in a human feeding trial.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G5, and ABCG8 mediate intestinal cholesterol absorption. It is unclear whether pravastatin (PR) or ezetimibe (EZ) affect expression of these transporters. We examined the effects of PR and EZ on NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and the murine small intestine. We also assessed expression of the transcription factors liver X receptor (LXR)a, LXRb and sterol regulatory element-binding protein.
Transporter mRNA levels were determined in murine small intestines 6 and 24 h after oral PR and EZ administration by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In PR- and EZ-treated HepG2 cells, transporter and transcription factor mRNA and protein levels were examined by RT-PCR and western blot, respectively.
Significant decreases in NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA expression were observed in the duodenum, but not jejunum and ileum, of mice 24 h after treatment with PR, but not EZ. In HepG2 cells, PR but not EZ treatment for 24 h also significantly decreased NPC1L1 protein and ABCG5, and ABCG8 mRNA expression, while increasing LXRa mRNA levels.
PR but not EZ treatment reduced duodenal cholesterol transporter expression in mice. PR-induced increases in LXRa mRNA levels may be involved in attenuation of NPC1L1 expression, subsequently decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most prevalent noncommunicable diseases in humans. Different studies have identified dietary procyanidins as bioactive compounds with beneficial properties against CVD by improving lipid homeostasis, among other mechanisms. The aim of this work was to assess whether grape seed procyanidin consumption at a physiological dose during the perinatal period could influence the CVD risk of the offspring. Wistar rat dams were treated with a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE; 25mg/kg of body weight per day) or vehicle during gestation and lactation. The adult male offspring of GSPE-treated dams presented decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, increased total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratios and an exacerbated fasting triglyceride-to-HDL-C ratios (atherogenic index of plasma) compared to the control group. Impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) was evidenced by the accumulation of cholesterol in skeletal muscle and by decreased fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acids, which was consistent with the observed mRNA down-regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the hepatic bile acid synthesis pathway Cyp7A1. Conversely, GSPE programming also resulted in up-regulated gene expression of different key components of the RCT process, such as hepatic Npc1, Abcg1, Abca1, Lxra, Srebp2, Lcat, Scarb1 and Pltp, and the repression of microRNA miR-33a expression, a key negative controller of hepatic RCT at the gene expression level. Our results show that maternal intake of grape procyanidins during the perinatal period impacts different components of the RCT process, resulting in increased CVD risk in the adult offspring. 
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an interferon (IFN)-induced gene that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which exerts broad-spectrum antiviral function. To investigate the roles of fish CH25H in Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection, we cloned and characterized a CH25H homolog from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcCH25H). EcCH25H encoded a 271-amino-acid polypeptide, with 86 and 59% homology with yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and humans, respectively. EcCH25H contained a conserved fatty acid (FA) hydroxylase domain and an ERG3 domain. EcCH25H expression was induced by RGNNV or SGIV infection, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or poly (I:C) treatment in vitro. Subcellular localization showed that EcCH25H and mutant EcCH25H-M were distributed in the cytoplasm and partly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. SGIV and RGNNV replication was decreased by EcCH25H overexpression, which was reflected in the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect and a decrease in viral gene transcription, but replication of both viruses was increased by knockdown of EcCH25H. Besides, the antiviral activity was dependent on its enzymatic activity. Treatment with 25HC significantly inhibited replication of SGIV and RGNNV. EcCH25H overexpression positively regulated the IFN-related molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, and increased both IFN and ISRE promoter activities. Moreover, 25HC treatment significantly suppressed SGIV and RGNNV entry into host cells. The similar inhibitory effect on SGIV entry was observed in EcCH25H overexpression cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that EcCH25H inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection by regulating IFN signaling molecules, and might also influence viral entry via an effect on cholesterol.
Electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care providers can be used for chronic disease surveillance; however, EHR-based prevalence estimates may be biased toward people who seek care. This study sought to describe the characteristics of an in-care population and compare them with those of a not-in-care population to inform interpretation of EHR data.
We used data from the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES), considered the gold standard for estimating disease prevalence, and the 2013 Community Health Survey, and classified participants as in care or not in care, on the basis of their report of seeing a health care provider in the previous year. We used œá(2) tests to compare the distribution of demographic characteristics, health care coverage and access, and chronic conditions between the 2 populations.
According to the Community Health Survey, approximately 4.1 million (71.7%) adults aged 20 or older had seen a health care provider in the previous year; according to NYC HANES, approximately 4.7 million (75.1%) had. In both surveys, the in-care population was more likely to be older, female, non-Hispanic, and insured compared with the not-in-care population. The in-care population from the NYC HANES also had a higher prevalence of diabetes (16.7% vs 6.9%; P &lt; .001), hypercholesterolemia (35.7% vs 22.3%; P &lt; .001), and hypertension (35.5% vs 26.4%; P &lt; .001) than the not-in-care population.
Systematic differences between in-care and not-in-care populations warrant caution in using primary care data to generalize to the population at large. Future efforts to use primary care data for chronic disease surveillance need to consider the intended purpose of data collected in these systems as well as the characteristics of the population using primary care.
