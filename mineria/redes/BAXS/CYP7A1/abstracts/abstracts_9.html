<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver, often associated with the dysregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. The hematopoietically expressed homeobox protein (Hhex) is an important transcription factor throughout liver development and is essential to liver bud formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Here, we report a relationship between Hhex expression and HCC. First, adenovirus-mediated Hhex delivery into the hepatoma cell line, Hepa1-6, resulted in decreased expression of several proto-oncogenes (c-Jun and Bcl2), increased expression of some tumor suppressor genes (P53 and Rb), and enhanced expression of a cluster of hepatocytic and bile ductular markers. Second, Hhex expression significantly attenuated Hepa1-6 tumorigenicity in nude mice. Third, we report a correlation between Hhex expression and the differentiation state of human HCC. In 24 cases of clinical specimens, there was a significant difference in Hhex expression between poorly differentiated HCC and well-differentiated HCC (P &lt; 0.001). Taken together, these results indicate that Hhex is a potential candidate molecular marker for HCC pathological evaluation, suggesting a need to evaluate Hhex as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually arises from hepatic fibrosis caused by chronic inflammation. In chronic liver damage, hepatic stellate cells undergo progressive activation to myofibroblasts (MFB), which are important extracellular-matrix-producing mesenchymal cells. Concomitantly, perturbation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling by pro-inflammatory cytokines in the epithelial cells of the liver (hepatocytes) promotes both fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis (fibro-carcinogenesis). Insights into fibro-carcinogenic effects on chronically damaged hepatocytes have come from recent detailed analyses of the TGF-β signaling process. Smad proteins, which convey signals from TGF-β receptors to the nucleus, have intermediate linker regions between conserved Mad homology (MH) 1 and MH2 domains. TGF-β type I receptor and pro-inflammatory cytokine-activated kinases differentially phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 to create phosphoisoforms phosphorylated at the COOH-terminal, linker, or both (L/C) regions. After acute liver injury, TGF-β-mediated pSmad3C signaling terminates hepatocytic proliferation induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated mitogenic pSmad3L pathway; TGF-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines synergistically enhance collagen synthesis by activated hepatic stellate cells via pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C pathways. During chronic liver disease progression, pre-neoplastic hepatocytes persistently affected by TGF-β together with pro-inflammatory cytokines come to exhibit the same carcinogenic (mitogenic) pSmad3L and fibrogenic pSmad2L/C signaling as do MFB, thereby accelerating liver fibrosis while increasing risk of HCC. This review of Smad phosphoisoform-mediated signals examines similarities and differences between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in acute and chronic liver injuries and considers Smad linker phosphorylation as a potential target for the chemoprevention of fibro-carcinogenesis.
rES (rhesus monkey embryonic stem) cells have similar characteristics to human ES (embryonic stem) cells, and might be useful as a substitute model for preclinical research. Before their clinical application, it is critical to understand the roles of factors that control the differentiation of ES cells into hepatocytes. Here, we analysed the effect of collagen gels on rES cells differentiation into hepatocytes by stepwise protocols. About 80% of DE (definitive endoderm) cells were generated from rES cells after being treated with activin A. The DE cells were then plated on to collagen gels or type I collagen-coated wells with growth factors to induce hepatocyte differentiation. In type I collagen systems, characteristics of immature hepatocytes were observed, including the expression of immature hepatic genes and the generation of 15±3% AFP (alpha fetoprotein)/CK (cytokeratin)18 double-positive cells. In collagen gel culture, differentiated cells exhibited typical hepatocyte morphology and expressed adult liver-specific genes. The mRNA expression of AFP (immature hepatic gene) was detected at day 11 but decreased at day 18. In contrast, mRNA expression of albumin (mature hepatic gene) was detected at day 11 and increased at day 18. Compared with type I collagen systems, significantly higher AFP/CK18 double-positive cells (68±7%) were produced in collagen gel culture. Furthermore, some differentiated cells acquired the hepatocytic function of glycogen storage. However, only immature hepatic genes were observed in collagen gel systems if growth factors were absent. Thus, collagen gels combined with hepatocyte-inducing growth factors efficiently promoted differentiation of hepatocytes from rES.
Under compromised biliary regeneration, transdifferentiation of hepatocytes into biliary epithelial cells (BEC) has been previously observed in rats, upon exposure to BEC-specific toxicant methylene dianiline (DAPM) followed by bile duct ligation (BDL), and in patients with chronic biliary liver disease. However, mechanisms promoting such transdifferentiation are not fully understood. In the present study, acquisition of biliary specific transcription factors by hepatocytes leading to reprogramming of BEC-specific cellular profile was investigated as a potential mechanism of transdifferentiation in two different models of compromised biliary regeneration in rats.
In addition to previously examined DAPM + BDL model, an experimental model resembling chronic biliary damage was established by repeated administration of DAPM. Hepatocyte to BEC transdifferentiation was tracked using dipetidyl dipeptidase IV (DDPIV) chimeric rats that normally carry DPPIV only in hepatocytes. Following DAPM treatment, ~20% BEC population turned DPPIV-positive, indicating that they are derived from DPPIV-positive hepatocytes. New ductules emerging after DAPM + BDL and repeated DAPM exposure expressed hepatocyte-associated transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α and biliary specific transcription factor HNF1β. In addition, periportal hepatocytes expressed biliary marker CK19 suggesting periportal hepatocytes as a potential source of transdifferentiating cells. Although TGFβ1 was induced, there was no considerable reduction in periportal HNF6 expression, as observed during embryonic biliary development.
Taken together, these findings indicate that gradual loss of HNF4α and acquisition of HNF1β by hepatocytes, as well as increase in TGFβ1 expression in periportal region, appear to be the underlying mechanisms of hepatocyte-to-BEC transdifferentiation.
Increasing evidence supports that modifications in the mitochondrial content, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, and cell metabolism influence the fate of stem cells. However, the regulators involved in the crosstalk between mitochondria and stem cell fate remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified a transcriptional regulatory axis, composed of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) (a downstream effector of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, repressed during differentiation) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) (the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, induced during differentiation), coupling the loss of pluripotency and early commitment to differentiation, to the initiation of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic shift toward OXPHOS. PGC-1α induction during differentiation is required for both mitochondrial biogenesis and commitment to the hepatocytic lineage, and TCF7L2 repression is sufficient to increase PGC-1α expression, mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS activity. We further demonstrate that OXPHOS activity is required for the differentiation toward the hepatocytic lineage, thus providing evidence that bi-directional interactions control stem cell differentiation and mitochondrial abundance and activity.

Decellularized tissues (DETs) have been attracting great attention as scaffolds for tissue-engineering approaches. Recently, some studies have reported that decellularized liver tissues (DLT) can provide an excellent environment for the hepatocytic differentiation of hepatic stem/progenitor cells that were already committed to the hepatocyte lineage. However, the effects of DLT on the hepatocytic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSs) have not yet been established. Here we studied the hepatocytic differentiation of iPSs on DLT and decellularized heart tissues (DHT) in order to determine the tissue-specific effects of DETs on iPSs differentiation. Our results showed that DLTs led to higher gene expression levels of forkhead box A2 (a marker of endoderm) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (master transcription factor to hepatocyte differentiation), alpha-fetoprotein (a marker of fetal hepatocyte,), and albumin (a marker of fetal and mature hepatocyte) of iPSs than on DHTs. Furthermore, gene expression levels of tyrosine aminotransferase (a marker of mature hepatocyte) were higher on DLT than that on DHT, and immunocytochemical analysis and ELISA assay showed that albumin secretion level of iPSs on DLT was higher than that on DHT. Our study demonstrated that the use of DLTs led to mature hepatocytic differentiation levels of iPSs compared to DHTs, which provides a better niche for iPSs cell engineering and enables the preparation of useful mature cells for regenerative therapy.
MYC activation at modest levels has been frequently found in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its significance in hepatocarcinogenesis has remained obscure. Here we examined the role of Myc activation in mouse liver tumours induced by hepatocytic expression of myristoylated AKT (AKT) and/or mutant HRASV12 (HRAS) via transposon-mediated gene integration. AKT or HRAS alone required 5 months to induce liver tumours, whereas their combination generated hepatocellular carcinoma within 8 weeks. Co-introduction of AKT and HRAS induced lipid-laden preneoplastic cells that grew into nodules composed of tumour cells with or without intracytoplasmic lipid, with the latter being more proliferative and associated with spontaneous Myc expression. AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis was almost completely abolished when MadMyc, a competitive Myc inhibitor, was expressed simultaneously. The Tet-On induction of MadMyc in preneoplastic cells significantly inhibited the progression of AKT/HRAS-induced tumours; its induction in transformed cells suppressed their proliferative activity with alterations in lipid metabolism and protein translation. Transposon-mediated Myc overexpression facilitated tumorigenesis by AKT or HRAS, and when it was co-introduced with AKT and HRAS, diffusely infiltrating tumours without lipid accumulation developed as early as 2 weeks. Examination of the dose-responses of Myc in the enhancement of AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis revealed that a reduction to one-third retained enhancing effect but three-times greater introduction damped the process with increased apoptosis. Myc overexpression suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, and when combined with HRAS introduction, it also suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in their degradation. Finally, the MYC-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma was characterized by the cytoplasm devoid of lipid accumulation, prominent nucleoli and a higher proliferative activity. Our results demonstrate that in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by both activated AKT and HRAS, activation of endogenous Myc is an enhancing factor and adequate levels of Myc deregulation further facilitate the process with alterations in cellular metabolism.
Netrin-1, a multifunctional secreted protein, is up-regulated in cancer and inflammation. Netrin-1 blocks apoptosis induced by the prototypical dependence receptors deleted in colorectal carcinoma and uncoordinated phenotype-5. Although the unfolded protein response (UPR) triggers apoptosis on exposure to stress, it first attempts to restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis to foster cell survival. Importantly, UPR is implicated in chronic liver conditions including hepatic oncogenesis. Netrin-1's implication in cell survival on UPR in this context is unknown.
Isolation of translational complexes, determination of RNA secondary structures by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension/dimethyl sulfate, bicistronic constructs, as well as conventional cell biology and biochemistry approaches were used on in vitro-grown hepatocytic cells, wild-type, and netrin-1 transgenic mice.
HepaRG cells constitute a bona fide model for UPR studies in vitro through adequate activation of the 3 sensors of the UPR (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)), inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The netrin-1 messenger RNA 5'-end was shown to fold into a complex double pseudoknot and bear E-loop motifs, both of which are representative hallmarks of related internal ribosome entry site regions. Cap-independent translation of netrin 5' untranslated region-driven luciferase was observed on UPR in vitro. Unlike several structurally related oncogenic transcripts (l-myc, c-myc, c-myb), netrin-1 messenger RNA was selected for translation during UPR both in human hepatocytes and in mice livers. Depletion of netrin-1 during UPR induces apoptosis, leading to cell death through an uncoordinated phenotype-5A/C-mediated involvement of protein phosphatase 2A and death-associated protein kinase 1 in vitro and in netrin transgenic mice.
UPR-resistant, internal ribosome entry site-driven netrin-1 translation leads to the inhibition of uncoordinated phenotype-5/death-associated protein kinase 1-mediated apoptosis in the hepatic context during UPR, a hallmark of chronic liver disease.
α-1 Antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, not all patients are susceptible to severe liver disease. In A1ATD, a toxic gain-of-function mutation generates insoluble ATZ "globules" in hepatocytes, overwhelming protein clearance mechanisms. The relationship between bile acids and hepatocytic autophagy is less clear but may involve altered gene expression pathways. Based on previous findings that bile duct ligation (BDL) induces autophagy, we hypothesized that retained bile acids may have hepatoprotective effects in PiZZ transgenic mice, which model A1ATD. We performed BDL and partial BDL (pBDL) in PiZZ mice, followed by analysis of liver tissues. PiZZ liver subjected to BDL showed up to 50% clearance of ATZ globules, with increased expression of autophagy proteins. Analysis of transcription factors revealed significant changes. Surprisingly nuclear TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy, remained unchanged. pBDL confirmed that ATZ globule clearance was induced by localized stimuli rather than diet or systemic effects. Several genes involved in bile metabolism were overexpressed in globule-devoid hepatocytes, compared to globule-containing cells. Retained bile acids led to a dramatic reduction of ATZ globules, with enhanced hepatocyte regeneration and autophagy. These findings support investigation of synthetic bile acids as potential autophagy-enhancing agents.
Recent investigations have reported many markers associated with human liver stem/progenitor cells, "oval cells," and identified "niches" in diseased livers where stem cells occur. However, there has remained a need to identify entire lineages of stem cells as they differentiate into bile ducts or hepatocytes. We have used combined immunohistochemical staining for a marker of hepatic commitment and specification (FOXA2 [Forkhead box A2]), hepatocyte maturation (Albumin and HepPar1), and features of bile ducts (CK19 [cytokeratin 19]) to identify lineages of stem cells differentiating toward the hepatocytic or bile ductular compartments of end-stage cirrhotic human liver. We identified large clusters of disorganized, FOXA2 expressing, oval cells in localized liver regions surrounded by fibrotic matrix, designated as "micro-niches." Specific FOXA2-positive cells within the micro-niches organize into primitive duct structures that support both hepatocytic and bile ductular differentiation enabling identification of entire lineages of cells forming the two types of structures. We also detected expression of hsa-miR-122 in primitive ductular reactions expected for hepatocytic differentiation and hsa-miR-23b cluster expression that drives liver cell fate decisions in cells undergoing lineage commitment. Our data establish the foundation for a mechanistic hypothesis on how stem cell lineages progress in specialized micro-niches in cirrhotic end-stage liver disease.
The beneficial impact of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on both acute and chronic liver diseases has been confirmed, although the molecular mechanisms behind it remain elusive. We aim to identify factors secreted by undifferentiated and hepatocytic differentiated MSC in vitro in order to delineate liver repair pathways potentially targeted by MSC.
Secreted factors were determined by protein arrays and related pathways identified by biomathematical analyses.
MSC from adipose tissue and bone marrow expressed a similar pattern of surface markers. After hepatocytic differentiation, CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1, ICAM-1) increased and CD166 (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, ALCAM) decreased. MSC secreted different factors before and after differentiation. These comprised cytokines involved in innate immunity and growth factors regulating liver regeneration. Pathway analysis revealed cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, chemokine signalling pathways, the complement and coagulation cascades as well as the Januskinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NOD-like receptor) signalling pathways as relevant networks. Relationships to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) signalling seemed also relevant.
MSC secreted proteins, which differed depending on cell source and degree of differentiation. The factors might address inflammatory and growth factor pathways as well as chemo-attraction and innate immunity. Since these are prone to dysregulation in most liver diseases, MSC release hepatotropic factors, potentially supporting liver regeneration.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is currently the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation without significant ethanol consumption. We have performed a screening for medicinal foods that inhibit hepatocytic lipid accumulation through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a critical regulator of the hepatic lipid metabolism.
We found that clove (Syzygium aromaticum), which is commonly used as a spice, markedly inhibits palmitate-inducible lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes. Analyses of the clove extracts found that β-caryophyllene, an orally-active cannabinoid, is the principal suppressor of the lipid accumulation, and stimulates the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). Our data also showed that β-caryophyllene prevents the translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) into the nucleus and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) into the cytoplasm through AMPK signaling, and consequently, induces a significant downregulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and upregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that the β-caryophyllene-induced activation of AMPK could be mediated by the cannabinoid type 2 receptor-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathway.
Our results suggest that β-caryophyllene has the potential efficacy in preventing and ameliorating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its associated metabolic disorders.
In the absence of an effective therapy against Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), chemoprevention remains an important strategy to circumvent morbidity and mortality. Here, we examined chemopreventive potential of Acteoside (ACT), a plant derived phenylethanoid glycoside against an environmental and dietary carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis. ACT treatment (0.1 and 0.3% supplemented with diet) started 2 weeks before DEN challenge and continued for 18 weeks thereafter, showed a remarkable chemopreventive activity. ACT treatment resulted in reduced HCC nodules. Histopathology showed progressive tissue damage, necrosis (5 weeks), hepatocytic injury (10 weeks), anisonucleosis with presence of prominent nucleoli, sinusidal dilations, and lymphomono nuclear inflammation (18 weeks). Biochemical analysis showed hepatocytic injury (raised ALT, p &lt; 0.001), inflammation [IL-6, IFN-γ (p &lt; 0.05), and TNF-α (p &lt; 0.001)], apoptosis [elevated Caspase-3 (p &lt; 0.001)]. ACT at 0.1 and 0.3% ameliorated DEN-induced pre-hepatocarcinogenic manifestations. Mechanistic studies of ACT chemoprevention was elucidated using Hep3B cells with an aim to develop an in vitro DEN-induced toxicity model. Hep3B was found to be a reliable and more sensitive towards DEN toxicity compared to HepG2 and HuH7 cells. ACT prevented DEN-induced cytotoxicity (p &lt; 0.001), DNA damage, and genotoxicity (micronuclei test, DNA ladder test, Hoechst staining, cell cycle analysis). ACT significantly (p &lt; 0.001) scavenged DEN-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss. Immunoblotting showed ACT treatment reversed DEN-induced NF-κB, Bax, Cytochrome C, Bcl-2, and Stat-3 levels. We conclude that chemoprotective effect of ACT is mediated by STAT-3 dependent regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis and ACT has potential to be developed as a chemopreventive agent. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The increasing demand and hampered use of primary human hepatocytes for research purposes have urged scientists to search for alternative cell sources, such as immortalized hepatic cell lines. The aim of this study was to develop a human hepatic cell line using the combined overexpression of TERT and the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and mutant isoform CDK4R24C. Following transduction of adult human primary hepatocytes with the selected immortalization genes, cell growth was triggered and a cell line was established. When cultured under appropriate conditions, the cell line expressed several hepatocytic markers and liver-enriched transcription factors at the transcriptional and/or translational level, secreted liver-specific proteins and showed glycogen deposition. These results suggest that the immortalization strategy applied to primary human hepatocytes could generate a novel hepatic cell line that seems to retain some key hepatic characteristics. 
Cholesterol metabolism disorder in hepatocytes predicts a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical players in cellular cholesterol metabolism, but their functions are not systematically clarified. Here, we have identified a novel lncRNA named lnc-HC negatively regulating cholesterol metabolism within hepatocytes through physical interaction with hnRNPA2B1. By further binding to the target messenger RNA of Cyp7a1 or Abca1, the lnc-HC-hnRNPA2B1 complex decreases expressions of the two genes that are implicated in cellular cholesterol excretion. lnc-HC knockdown can strongly recover the cholesterol disorder in vivo. In the upstream pathway, lnc-HC is up-regulated by high cholesterol by the transcription activator, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta.
These findings suggest a subtle feed-forward regulation of lnc-HC in cholesterol metabolism and define a novel line of evidence by which lncRNAs modulate the metabolic system at the post-transcriptional level. (Hepatology 2016;64:58-72).
The death rate from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing, and liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Most patients with HCC have underlying liver cirrhosis and compromised liver function, limiting treatment options. Cirrhosis is associated with cell dedifferentiation and expansion of hepatocholangiolar progenitor cells. We identified a microRNA signature associated with HCC and hepatocytic differentiation of progenitor cells. We further identified miR-148a as an inducer of hepatocytic differentiation that is down-regulated in HCC. MiR-148a-mimetic treatment in vivo suppressed tumor growth, reduced tumor malignancy and liver fibrosis, and prevented tumor development. These effects were associated with an increased differentiated phenotype and mediated by IκB kinase alpha/NUMB/NOTCH signaling.
miR-148a is an inhibitor of the IκB kinase alpha/NUMB/NOTCH pathway and an inducer of hepatocytic differentiation that when deregulated promotes HCC initiation and progression. Differentiation-targeted therapy may be a promising strategy to treat and prevent HCC.
Hepatic stem/progenitor cells, hepatoblasts, have a high proliferative ability and can differentiate into mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Therefore, these cells are considered to be useful for regenerative medicine and drug screening for liver diseases. However, it is problem that in vitro maturation of hepatoblasts is insufficient in the present culture system. In this study, a novel regulator to induce hepatic differentiation was identified and the molecular function of this factor was examined in embryonic day 13 hepatoblast culture with maturation factor, oncostatin M and extracellular matrices. Overexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix type transcription factor, Mist1, induced expression of mature hepatocytic markers such as carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase1 and several cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes in this culture system. In contrast, Mist1 suppressed expression of cholangiocytic markers such as Sox9, Sox17, Ck19, and Grhl2. CYP3A metabolic activity was significantly induced by Mist1 in this hepatoblast culture. In addition, Mist1 induced liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α, which are known to be involved in liver functions. These results suggest that Mist1 partially induces mature hepatocytic expression and function accompanied by the down-regulation of cholangiocytic markers. 
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1B) is involved in the hepatobiliary specification of hepatoblasts to cholangiocytes during liver development, and is strongly expressed throughout adult biliary epithelium. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of HNF-1B in different pathologic subtypes of primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and the relationship between HNF-1B expression, clinicopathological features and prognosis. We retrospectively investigated 2 cohorts of patients, including 183 HCCs and 69 ICCs. The expression of HNF-1B was examined by immunohistochemistry. We found that HNF-1B expression was associated with pathological subtype of primary tumor, and HNF-1B expression in HCC tissue may be associated with the change of phenotype on recurrence. The HNF-1B expression was positively correlated with biliary/HPC (hepatic progenitor cell) markers expression. Further, multivariable analysis showed that HNF-1B expression was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients. However, no correlation between HNF-1B expression and survival was found in ICC patients. In summary, HCC with high HNF-1B expression displayed biliary phenotype and tended to show poorer prognosis. HNF-1B-positive malignant cells could be bipotential cells and give rise to both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages during tumorigenesis. 
Fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells, hepatoblasts, are highly proliferative cells and the source of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In contrast, mature hepatocytes have a low proliferative potency and high metabolic functions. Cell proliferation is regulated by cell cycle-related molecules. However, the correlation between cell cycle regulation and hepatic maturation are still unknown. To address this issue, we revealed that the cell cycle inhibitor p57(Kip2) was expressed in the hepatoblasts and mesenchymal cells of fetal liver in a spatiotemporal manner. In addition, we found that hepatoblasts in p57(Kip2)-/- mice were highly proliferative and had deficient maturation compared with those in wild-type (WT) mice. However, there were no remarkable differences in the expression levels of cell cycle- and bipotency-related genes except for Ccnd2. Furthermore, p57(Kip2)-/- hepatoblasts could differentiate into mature hepatocytes in p57(Kip2)-/- and WT chimeric mice, suggesting that the intrinsic activity of p57(Kip2) does not simply regulate hepatoblast maturation. 
Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) have been touted as an ideal stem cell candidate, being ethically neutral, immunologically naïve, plentiful in origin, and retaining plasticity in its fetal stage. We hypothesized that by applying natural physiological signals of the developing liver, hAECs can be coaxed into becoming functional immunopermissive hepatocyte-like cells. These cells would have tremendous potential for allogenic cellular transplantation in the treatment of chronic liver insufficiency.
hAECs were obtained from term placentas and subjected to hepatic trans-differentiation. Hepatic differentiated cells were analyzed with immunophenotyping, electron microscopy, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as well as characterized for hepatic metabolic function. In vivo efficacy was tested using intrasplenic transplantation into non-obese diabetic (NOD) Scid Gamma mice with thioacetamide-induced chronic liver failure and analyzed for engraftment and improvement in liver indices.
With hepatic differentiation, hAECs assumed a hepatocytic polygonal morphology with upregulation of transcription factors responsible for liver specification. These hepatic differentiated-hAECs (HD-AECs) demonstrated bile canaliculi formation, secreted albumin, eliminated indo-cyanine green, uptook low-density lipoprotein, and inducible CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymatic activities. Transplantation of HD-AECs and de novo hAECs in mice model of cirrhosis showed successful in vivo engraftment and differentiation into functional hepatocytes positive for human-specific albumin. HD-AEC cells that had undergone hepatic differentiation showed the greatest improvement in albumin function while preserving human leukocyte antigen-G expression postdifferentiation.
hAECs were able to differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells both in vivo and in vitro. They showed therapeutic efficacy after transplantation in mice model of cirrhosis, offering an exciting source of cells for generation of functionally useful hepatocytes.
MicroRNA 122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in the liver where it influences diverse biological processes and pathways, including hepatitis C virus replication and metabolism of iron and cholesterol. It is processed from a long non-coding primary transcript (~7.5 kb) and the gene has two evolutionarily-conserved regions containing the pri-mir-122 promoter and pre-mir-122 hairpin region. Several groups reported that the widely-used hepatocytic cell line HepG2 had deficient expression of miR-122, previously ascribed to deletion of the pre-mir-122 stem-loop region. We aimed to characterise this deletion by direct sequencing of 6078 bp containing the pri-mir-122 promoter and pre-mir-122 stem-loop region in HepG2 and Huh-7, a control hepatocytic cell line reported to express miR-122, supported by sequence analysis of cloned genomic DNA. In contrast to previous findings, the entire sequence was present in both cell lines. Ten SNPs were heterozygous in HepG2 indicating that DNA was present in two copies. Three validation isolates of HepG2 were sequenced, showing identical genotype to the original in two, whereas the third was different. Investigation of promoter chromatin status by FAIRE showed that Huh-7 cells had 6.2 ± 0.19- and 2.7 ± 0.01- fold more accessible chromatin at the proximal (HNF4α-binding) and distal DR1 transcription factor sites, compared to HepG2 cells (p=0.03 and 0.001, respectively). This was substantiated by ENCODE genome annotations, which showed a DNAse I hypersensitive site in the pri-mir-122 promoter in Huh-7 that was absent in HepG2 cells. While the origin of the reported deletion is unclear, cell lines should be obtained from a reputable source and used at low passage number to avoid discrepant results. Deficiency of miR-122 expression in HepG2 cells may be related to a relative deficiency of accessible promoter chromatin in HepG2 versus Huh-7 cells. 
To investigate the relationship between the iron-metabolism-related gene expression profiles and efficacy of antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients.
The hepatic expression profile of iron-metabolism-related genes was analyzed and its association with virological response to pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy was evaluated. A hundred patients with chronic hepatitis C (genotype1b, n = 50; genotype 2, n = 50) were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Liver biopsy samples were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction for iron-metabolism-related genes and protein expression (Western blotting analysis) for ferroportin. As a control, normal liver tissue was obtained from 18 living donors of liver transplantation. Serum hepcidin level was measured by sensitive liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
Iron overload is associated with liver damage by increasing oxidative stress and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is reported to induce iron accumulation in hepatocytes in vivo. Conversely, iron administration suppresses HCV replication in vitro. Therefore, the association between HCV infection and iron metabolism remains unclear. Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher gene expression for transferrin, iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2, divalent metal transporter 1, and ferroportin, but similar for transferrin receptors 1 and 2, and hepcidin. When the expression profiles were compared between sustained virological response (SVR) and non-SVR patients, the former showed significantly lower transcription and protein expression of hepcidin and ferroportin. Expression of hepcidin-regulating genes, BMPR1, BMPR2, and hemojuvelin, was significantly increased, whereas BMP2 was decreased in HCV-infected liver. BMPR2 and hemojuvelin expression was significantly lower in the SVR than non-SVR group. HCV infection affects the expression of iron-metabolism-related genes, leading to iron accumulation in hepatocytes.
Decreased expression of hepcidin and ferroportin in SVR patients indicates the importance of hepatocytic iron retention for viral response during pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin treatment.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a family of the major serine/threonine phosphatases in cells, regulates many aspects of physiological processes. However, isoform-specific substrates and the biological role of each specific member of the PP2A family remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether PP2A catalytic subunit Cα (PP2Acα) is involved in chronic hepatic injury and fibrosis. A hepatocyte-specific PP2Acα ablation mice model was established to examine the effect of PP2Acα on carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced chronic hepatic injury and fibrosis. Our results showed that PP2Acα knockout mice were less susceptible to chronic CCl4-induced liver injury as evidenced by lower levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, decreased hepatocyte proliferation, and increased rate of apoptotic removal of the injured hepatocytes. PP2Acα knockout mice also displayed a lesser extent of liver fibrosis as a significant decrease in the proportion of α-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells and collagen deposition was observed in their liver tissues. Furthermore, the levels of serum TGF-β1 and hepatocytic Smad phosphorylation were reduced in the PP2Acα knockout mice. These data suggest that hepatocyte-specific ablation of PP2Acα protects against CCl4-induced chronic hepatic injury and fibrogenesis and the protective effect is mediated at least partially through the impaired TGF-β1/Smad signaling. 
Late fetal and adult livers are reported to contain bipotential liver stem/progenitor cells (LPCs), which share surface markers, including epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), with cholangiocytes and differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. However, recent results do not necessarily support the idea that LPCs contribute significantly to cellular turnover and regeneration by supplying new hepatocytes. Here, we examined the colony-forming capability of EpCAM(+) cells isolated from mouse livers between E17 and 11 weeks of age. We found that the number of bipotential colonies was greatly reduced between 1 and 6 weeks, indicating that the number of LPCs decreases during postnatal development. Moreover, bipotential colonies derived from adult LPCs contained substantially fewer albumin(+) cells than those from neonatal LPCs. We further examined the differentiation potential of neonatal and adult LPCs by transplantation and found that neonatal cells differentiated into mature hepatocytes in recipient livers more frequently than adult LPCs. Since we previously reported that the transcription factor grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expressed in EpCAM(+) cells inhibits hepatocytic differentiation, we examined whether targets of GRHL2 might block hepatocytic differentiation. DNA and microRNA microarrays revealed that miR122, the expression of which correlates with hepatocytic differentiation, was greatly reduced in adult as compared with neonatal EpCAM(+) cells. Indeed, GRHL2 negatively regulates the promoter/enhancer activity of the Mir122 gene. Our results indicate that neonatal but not adult EpCAM(+) LPCs have great potential to produce albumin(+) hepatocytes. GRHL2 suppresses transcription of miR122 and thereby restricts the differentiation potential of adult LPCs.
Rodent cancer bioassays indicate that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist, 2,3,7,8-tetracholorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), causes increases in both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic tumors. Effects of AHR activation have been evaluated on rodent hepatic stem cells (rHpSCs) versus their descendants, hepatoblasts (rHBs), two lineage stages of multipotent, hepatic precursors with overlapping but also distinct phenotypic traits. This was made possible by defining the first successful culture conditions for ex vivo maintenance of rHpScs consisting of a substratum of hyaluronans and Kubota's medium (KM), a serum-free medium designed for endodermal stem/progenitor cells. Supplementation of KM with leukemia inhibitory factor elicited lineage restriction to rHBs. Cultures were treated with various AHR agonists including TCDD, 6-formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), and 3-3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and then analyzed with a combination of immunocytochemistry, gene expression, and high-content image analysis. The AHR agonists increased proliferation of rHpSCs at concentrations producing a persistent AHR activation as indicated by induction of Cyp1a1. By contrast, treatment with TCDD resulted in a rapid loss of viability of rHBs, even though the culture conditions, in the absence of the agonists, were permissive for survival and expansion of rHBs. The effects were not observed with FICZ and at lower concentrations of DIM.
Our findings are consistent with a lineage-dependent mode of action for AHR agonists in rodent liver tumorigenesis through selective expansion of rHpSCs in combination with a toxicity-induced loss of viability of rHBs. These lineage-dependent effects correlate with increased frequency of liver tumors.
The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development increases as hepatitis virus C (HCV)-related liver diseases progress, especially in patients with active inflammation. Insight into hepatic carcinogenesis have emerged from recent detailed analyses of transforming growth factor-β and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling processes directed by multiple phosphorylated (phospho)-isoforms of a Smad3 mediator. In the course of HCV-related chronic liver diseases, chronic inflammation and host genetic/epigenetic alterations additively shift the hepatocytic Smad3 phospho-isoform signaling from tumor suppression to carcinogenesis, increasing the risk of HCC. Chronic inflammation represents an early carcinogenic step that provides a nonmutagenic tumor-promoting stimulus. After undergoing successful antiviral therapy, patients with chronic hepatitis C could experience a lower risk of HCC as Smad3 phospho-isoform signaling reverses from potential carcinogenesis to tumor suppression. Even after HCV clearance, however, patients with cirrhosis could still develop HCC because of sustained, intense carcinogenic Smad3 phospho-isoform signaling that is possibly caused by genetic or epigenetic alterations. Smad3 phospho-isoforms should assist with evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing human HCC. 
Cholangiocytes are biliary epithelial cells, which, like hepatocytes, originate from hepatoblasts during embryonic development. In this study we investigated the potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to differentiate into cholangiocytes and we report a new approach, which drives differentiation of hESCs toward the cholangiocytic lineage using feeder-free and defined culture conditions. After differentiation into hepatic progenitors, hESCs were differentiated further into cholangiocytes using growth hormone, epidermal growth factor, interleukin-6, and then sodium taurocholate. These conditions also allowed us to generate cholangiocytes from HepaRG-derived hepatoblasts. hESC- and HepaRG-derived cholangiocyte-like cells expressed markers of cholangiocytes including cytokeratin 7 and osteopontin, and the transcription factors SOX9 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 6. The cells also displayed specific proteins important for cholangiocyte functions including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, secretin receptor, and nuclear receptors. They formed primary cilia and also responded to hormonal stimulation by increase of intracellular Ca(2+) . We demonstrated by integrative genomics that the expression of genes, which signed hESC- or HepaRG-cholangiocytes, separates hepatocytic lineage from cholangiocyte lineage. When grown in a 3D matrix, cholangiocytes developed epithelial/apicobasal polarity and formed functional cysts and biliary ducts. In addition, we showed that cholangiocyte-like cells could also be generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach with stem/progenitor cells of diverse origins.
We have developed a robust and efficient method for differentiating pluripotent stem cells into cholangiocyte-like cells, which display structural and functional similarities to bile duct cells in normal liver. These cells will be useful for the in vitro study of the molecular mechanisms of bile duct development and have important potential for therapeutic strategies, including bioengineered liver approaches.
Excessive hepatic glucose production is a hallmark of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The cAMP responsive transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), thought to be a key activator of the hepatic gluconeogenic gene regulation programme, has been suggested as a therapeutic target to reduce glucose output by the liver. Here, we test directly the requirement for hepatocytic CREB for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.
We derived mice with a Creb (also known as Creb1) loxP allele for conditional, cell-type specific gene ablation. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Creb was induced by injecting Creb (loxP/loxP) mice with Cre recombinase expression adeno-associated virus.
Strikingly, we found no difference in fed and fasted glucose levels, or in glucose, insulin and glucagon tolerance in mice fed a normal chow or a high-fat diet. In addition, mRNA levels of liver-specific genes, including several CREB target genes involved in gluconeogenesis, were not affected by CREB deficiency in the liver.
Our data show that CREB has no non-redundant functions in hepatic glucose metabolism, and is therefore not likely to be a useful target for the development of glucose-lowering drugs.
It has been shown that mature hepatocytes compensate tissue damages not only by proliferation and/or hypertrophy but also by conversion into cholangiocyte-like cells. We found that Sry HMG box protein 9-positive (Sox9(+)) epithelial cell adhesion molecule-negative (EpCAM(-)) hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α-positive (HNF4α(+)) biphenotypic cells showing hepatocytic morphology appeared near EpCAM(+) ductular structures in the livers of mice fed 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-containing diet. When Mx1-Cre:ROSA mice, which were injected with poly(I:C) to label mature hepatocytes, were fed with the DDC diet, we found LacZ(+)Sox9(+) cells near ductular structures. Although Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells adjacent to expanding ducts likely further converted into ductular cells, the incidence was rare. To know the cellular characteristics of Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells, we isolated them as GFP(+)EpCAM(-) cells from DDC-injured livers of Sox9-EGFP mice. Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells proliferated and could differentiate to functional hepatocytes in vitro. In addition, Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells formed cysts with a small central lumen in collagen gels containing Matrigel® without expressing EpCAM. These results suggest that Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells maintaining biphenotypic status can establish cholangiocyte-type polarity. Interestingly, we found that some of the Sox9(+) cells surrounded luminal spaces in DDC-injured liver while they expressed HNF4α. Taken together, we consider that in addition to converting to cholangiocyte-like cells, Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells provide luminal space near expanded ductular structures to prevent deterioration of the injuries and potentially supply new hepatocytes to repair damaged tissues. 
Molecular heterogeneity between primary tumors (PTs) and synchronous resected liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) has potential relevance in treatment strategies. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may be able to increase the chances of identifying multiple molecular driver alterations, calling for therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate mutations in PT and synchronous resected liver metastases for patients with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) exon 2 wild-type metastatic (m)CRC who underwent chemotherapy (CT) featuring an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody. Genomic analysis was performed on 54 lesions from 7 patients with mCRC. For each patient, a PT biopsy or a surgical specimen was obtained prior to CT, and the PT and all liver metastases resected following CT were analyzed. DNA libraries were generated using the Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer Panel, assessing the most frequent somatic mutations in 22 genes involved in colon tumorigenesis, and sequencing was performed on an Ion Personal Genome Machine system. A partial response was achieved in all the patients, with a median progression free survival time of 11 months (range, 3-21 months). All the patients were subjected to surgical liver metastasis resection. The median overall survival time was 31 months (range, 4-46 months). Molecular analysis of the genes correlated with the target therapy, suggesting significant intratumor heterogeneity, as revealed by the different mutational landscape of certain PTs and synchronous resected liver metastases following systemic therapy when compared with the PT prior to treatment. In particular, the loss and acquisition of mutations in KRAS, neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), tumor protein p53 (TP53), the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA), F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were observed. In addition, one patient developed a mucinous pattern following systemic CT. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that intratumor heterogeneity is likely to affect the response to therapy, and to drive acquired resistance to targeted agents. The preliminary data also suggest a potential role for NGS in the evaluation of biological drug resistance, affecting future sequential treatment strategies.
A newborn female child was born with a congenital pigment synthesizing melanoma of the scalp. Further workup revealed metastatic disease within the liver, lungs, and left tibia. Whole exome sequencing was performed on multiple samples that revealed one somatic mutation, lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C), at low allelic frequency but no v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), NF-1 mutation. Programmed death ligand 1 was moderately expressed. Treatment was initiated with the programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor nivolumab. The patient tolerated this treatment well with minimal toxicity. She is now over a year out from initial diagnosis, continuing on nivolumab, with stable disease.
Macrophage foam cell formation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The protein Tribbles homolog 1 (Trib1), a member of the Tribbles protein family, functions as an adaptor or scaffold protein. Recent studies have indicated its implication in lipoprotein metabolism. In the present study, the role of Trib1 in macrophage foam cell formation was investigated. Oil red O staining was used to analyze intracellular lipid deposition, while the effects of Trib1 overexpression on cholesterol efflux were also examined. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed to measure the expression levels of genes involved in cholesterol efflux. The results revealed that overexpression of Trib1 inhibited lipid accumulation in oxidized low density lipoprotein-treated THP-1 macrophages and facilitated macrophage cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. Overexpression of Trib1 also upregulated the expression levels of ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), ABCG1, liver X receptor α (LXRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). In addition, silencing of LXRα or PPARγ via small interfering RNA transfection significantly reversed the Trib1-induced cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, Trib1 inhibits macrophage foam cell formation and enhances cholesterol efflux, which is associated with regulation of the PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression levels.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is critical for the growth and proliferation of cancer cells and other biological processes, including lipid transportation and metabolism, sexual determination and steroidogenesis. However, because homozygous lrh-1-/- mice die in utero, the regulatory mechanisms involved in embryonic development mediated by this receptor are poorly understood. In the present study, we performed transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated loss-of-function assays, taking advantage of zebrafish external fertilization, to investigate the function of lrh-1. The digestive organs were affected by lrh-1 depletion as a result of cell-cycle arrest (at the checkpoint of G1 to S phase), but not cell apoptosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that LRH-1 augments the transcriptional activity of β-catenin 1 and 2 via physical interactions. Screening the specific ligand(s) sensed by LRH-1 during organogenesis revealed that phosphatidylcholine (PC), a potential ligand, is the upstream target of LRH-1 during endoderm development. These data provide evidence for the crosstalk between the PC/LRH-1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways during the expansion growth of endoderm organs.
Frizzled 6 (FZD6) encodes an integral membrane protein that functions in multiple signal transduction pathways, for example, as a receptor in Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway for polarized cell migration and organ morphogenesis. Mutations in FZD6 have been identified in a variety of tumors. In this study, the full-length cDNA of Sus scrofa FZD6 (Sfz6) was cloned and characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrates that the Sfz6 gene encodes the 712 amino-acid (aa) protein with seven transmembrane domain. Tissue distribution analysis showed that Sfz6 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, being highest in kidney, moderate in jejunum, ileum, colon, liver, and spleen. However, FZD6 protein is highly expressed in the heart and there was no significant difference in other tissues. The relative abundance and localization of FZD6 protein in jejunum along the crypt-villus axis was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical localization. The results show that in the jejunum, FZD6 protein is highly expressed in the villus and less in the crypt cells. Cellular proliferation and viability assays indicate that knockdown of FZD6 with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) significantly reduced the cell viability of the intestinal porcine enterocyte cells (IPEC-J2). Furthermore, qPCR and Western blot analysis revealed that expressions of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1); ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), some components of PCP signaling pathway were upregulated (P &lt; 0.05) by knockdown of FZD6 in IPEC-J2 cells. In conclusion, these results showed that FZD6 abundance in the villus was higher than that in crypt cells and knockdown of FZD6 induces PCP signal pathway components expression in IPEC-J2 cells. Our findings provide the foundation for further investigation into porcine FZD6 gene.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis, cholesterol reverse transport, steroidogenesis, and exocrine pancreatic enzyme production. In the current study, previously published data from a genome wide analysis of LRH-1 binding in the liver were re-analyzed to identify new LRH-1 targets and propose new roles for LRH-1 in the liver. Superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) was identified, which contains putative LRH-1 binding sites in the proximal promoter. When hepatocytes were treated with the LRH-1 agonist RJW101, Sod2 expression was dramatically increased and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which was induced by a high concentration of palmitate, was significantly reduced. A LRH-1 binding site was mapped to -288/-283 in the Sod2 promoter, which increased Sod2 promoter activity in response to LRH-1 and its agonist. LRH-1 binding to this site was confirmed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. These results suggest that Sod2 is a target gene of LRH-1, and that LRH-1 agonists can mediate a reduction in ROS production and oxidative stress driven by an excess of fatty acids, as exhibited in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
BACKGROUND In view of the important function of nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH 1) in various biological processes and the physiological changes accompanying unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (USRA), our study was carried out to investigate the potential roles of LRH-1 in USRA. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty patients with URSA at early the early state of pregnancy were selected, and 30 patients with normal early pregnancy were also selected from Aug 2015 to Sep 2016 as a control group. The expression of LRH-1 protein in decidua and villi were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and the expression of LRH-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The expression levels of CYP19 and P450scc were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis at mRNA and protein levels, respectively. RESULTS The levels of LRH-1, CYP19, and P450scc mRNA and protein in villi of the patients in the URSA group were significantly lower than in the control group. There were no significant differences between the URSA group and control group in the levels of LRH-1, CYP19, and P450scc mRNA and protein in villi in decidua. CONCLUSIONS URSA was related to the reduced expression level of LRH-1 in villous tissues but not in decidua, and expression of LRH-1 may be related to the expression of CYP19 and P450scc. We believe that the expression level of LRH-1 can be used as a marker in the early diagnosis of URSA, and the regulation of LRH-1 expression many lead to new URSA treatments.
The orphan nuclear receptor, liver receptor homolog-1 (aka Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, Group A, Member 2 (Nr5a2)), is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and its ovarian expression is restricted to granulosa cells of activated follicles. We employed the floxed Nr5a2 (Nr5a2f/f) mutant mouse line and two granulosa-specific Cre lines, Anti-Müllerian hormone receptor- 2 (Amhr2Cre) and transgenic cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (tgCyp19Cre), to develop two tissue- and time-specific Nr5a2 depletion models: Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/-. In the Nr5a2Cyp19-/- ovaries, Nr5a2 was depleted in mural granulosa, but not cumulus cells. We induced follicular development in mutant and wild-type (control, CON) mice with equine chorionic gonadotropin followed 44 h later treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to induce ovulation. Both Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- cumulus-oocyte complexes underwent a reduced degree of expansion in vitro relative to wild-type mice. We found downregulation of epiregulin (Ereg), amphiregulin (Areg), betacellulin (Btc) and tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6 (Tnfaip6) transcripts in Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- ovaries. Tnfaip6 protein abundance, by quantitative immunofluorescence, was likewise substantially reduced in the Nr5a2-depleted model. Transcript abundance for connexin 43 (Gja1) in granulosa cells was lower at 0 h and maximum at 8 h post-hCG in both Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- follicles, while Gja1 protein was not different prior to the ovulatory signal, but elevated at 8 h in Nr5a2Amhr2-/- and Nr5a2Cyp19-/- follicles. In both mutant genotypes, oocytes can mature in vivo and resulting embryos were capable of proceeding to blastocyst stagein vitro. We conclude that Nr5a2 is essential for cumulus expansion in granulosa cells throughout follicular development. The disruption of Nr5a2 in follicular somatic cells does not affect the capacity of the oocyte to be fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
Daytime restricted feeding (2 h of food access from 12.00 to 14.00 hours for 3 weeks) is an experimental protocol that modifies the relationship between metabolic networks and the circadian molecular clock. The precise anatomical locus that controls the biochemical and physiological adaptations to optimise nutrient use is unknown. We explored the changes in liver oxidative lipid handling, such as β-oxidation and its regulation, as well as adaptations in the lipoprotein profile. It was found that daytime restricted feeding promoted an elevation of circulating ketone bodies before mealtime, an altered hepatic daily rhythmicity of 14CO2 production from radioactive palmitic acid, and an up-regulation of the fatty acid oxidation activators, the α-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the deacetylase silent mating type information regulation homolog 1, and the transcriptional factor PPARγ-1α coactivator. An increased localisation of phosphorylated α-subunit of AMPK in the periportal hepatocytes was also observed. Liver hepatic lipase C, important for lipoprotein transformation, showed a change of daily phase with a peak at the time of food access. In serum, there was an increase of LDL, which was responsible for a net elevation of circulating cholesterol. We conclude that our results indicate an enhanced fasting response in the liver during daily synchronisation to food access, which involves altered metabolic and cellular control of fatty acid oxidation as well a significant elevation of serum LDL. These adaptations could be part of the metabolic input that underlies the expression of the food-entrained oscillator.
Our previous study had suggested Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) might be involved in metabolic syndrome via adipose tissue. Given prior studies, we sought to determine whether TRB3 plays a major role in adipocytes and adipose tissue with beneficial metabolic effects in obese and diabetic rats. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated to induce insulin resistant adipocytes. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were all fed high-fat (HF) diet. Type 2 diabetic rat model was induced by high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). Compared with control group, in insulin resistant adipocytes, protein levels of insulin receptor substrate-1(IRS-1), glucose transporter 4(GLUT4) and phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK)were reduced, TRB3 protein level and triglyceride level were significantly increased, glucose uptake was markedly decreased. TRB3 silencing alleviated adipocytes insulin resistance. With TRB3 gene silencing, protein levels of IRS-1, GLUT4 and p-AMPK were significantly increased in adipocytes. TRB3 gene silencing decreased blood glucose, ameliorated insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue remodeling in diabetic rats. TRB3 silencing decreased triglyceride, increased glycogen simultaneously in diabetic epididymal and brown adipose tissues (BAT). Consistently, p-AMPK levels were increased in diabetic epididymal adipose tissue, and BAT after TRB3-siRNA treatment. TRB3silencing increased phosphorylation of Akt in liver, and improved liver insulin resistance.
Human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) detoxifies the oxidized DNA precursor 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate and serves a tumor suppressive role in distinct types of cancer. In the present study, the expression of MTH1 was examined in various subtypes of breast cancer, and the effect of its suppression on breast cancer growth was characterized in vitro and in vivo. MTH1 mRNA and protein levels were assessed using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The effect of MTH1 expression on the proliferation of breast cancer cells was investigated in vitro using Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays, and in vivo using breast cancer cell line xenografts in mice. The toxicity of the MTH1 inhibitor TH588 was investigated in nude mice. A marked increase in MTH1 protein and mRNA levels was demonstrated in breast cancer tissues compared with the non-cancerous control. However, no apparent differences in MTH1 expression were observed between distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer. MTH1 overexpression was demonstrated to be independent of patient age, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of MTH1 decreased cancer cell viability and the clonogenic potential of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results were confirmed by decreased in vivo proliferation of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cancer cell lines, representing distinct subtypes of breast cancer. Although inhibition of MTH1 activity decreased xenograft growth in mice, no major adverse effects of TH588 were detected on the basis of blood biochemistry, and liver and kidney function. The results of the present study suggested that MTH1 is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers, independent of the molecular identity and clinicopathological features of the tumor, including patient age, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of MTH1 activity suppressed the growth of three subtypes of breast cancer, including luminal, basal-like and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the MTH1 inhibitor appears to be safe; however, further studies are required prior to the clinical use of MTH1 inhibitors.
CD95/Fas ligand (FasL) is a cell death-promoting member of the tumor necrosis factor family with important functions in the regulation of T-cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. In T cells, FasL expression is tightly regulated on a transcriptional level involving a complex set of different transcription factors. The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1/NR5a2) is involved in the regulation of development, lipid metabolism and proliferation and is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues. However, its expression in T lymphocytes has never been reported so far. Based on in silico analysis, we identified potential LRH-1 binding sites within the FASLG promoter. Here, we report that LRH-1 is expressed in primary and secondary lymphatic tissues, as well as in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. LRH-1 directly binds to its binding sites in the FASLG promoter, and thereby drives FASLG promoter activity. Mutations in the LRH-1 binding sites reduce FASLG promoter activity. Pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 decreases activation-induced FasL mRNA expression, as well as FasL-mediated activation-induced T-cell apoptosis and T-cell cytotoxicity. In a mouse model of Concanavalin A-induced and FasL-mediated hepatitis pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 resulted in decreased hepatic FasL expression and a significant reduction of liver damage. In summary, these data show for the first time LRH-1 expression in T cells, its role in FASLG transcription and the potential of pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 in the treatment of FasL-mediated immunopathologies.
Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a mostly incurable disease. The fact that the identity of the mechanisms that regulate metastasis in HCC is known hampers the development of anti-metastatic therapies. Currently, there is no effective treatment for HCC once it is progressed to metastatic stage. Therefore, further study to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the metastasis of HCC is urgently required for the improvement of HCC treatment. Here, we describes actin gamma smooth muscle 2 (ACTG2) over-express in HCC and demonstrates high-expression of ACTG2 as a promising therapeutic target in HCC metastasis. The use of shRNA to knock-down ACTG2 impaired cells migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, silencing of ACTG2 causes almost complete inhibition of metastasis in vivo. In contrast, overexpression ACTG2 significantly enforces HCC cells migration and metastasis. Finally, ACTG2 boosts the metastatic potential of HCC cells in a Notch homolog 1 (Notch1) dependent manner. Collectively, our study reveals a critical role of ACTG2 in HCC tumor metastasis, and renders it a novel target for the treatment of HCC.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) regulates energy metabolism by directly interacting with transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Among the PGC1α binding partners is liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1; NR5A2), an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that controls lipid and glucose homeostasis. Although PGC1α is known to bind and activate LRH-1, mechanisms through which PGC1α changes LRH-1 conformation to drive transcription are unknown. Here, we used biochemical and structural methods to interrogate the LRH-1-PGC1α complex. Purified, full-length LRH-1, as well as isolated ligand binding domain, bound to PGC1α with higher affinity than to the coactivator, nuclear receptor coactivator-2 (Tif2), in coregulator peptide recruitment assays. We present the first crystal structure of the LRH-1-PGC1α complex, which depicts several hydrophobic contacts and a strong charge clamp at the interface between these partners. In molecular dynamics simulations, PGC1α induced correlated atomic motion throughout the entire LRH-1 activation function surface, which was dependent on charge-clamp formation. In contrast, Tif2 induced weaker signaling at the activation function surface than PGC1α but promoted allosteric signaling from the helix 6/β-sheet region of LRH-1 to the activation function surface. These studies are the first to probe mechanisms underlying the LRH-1-PGC1α interaction and may illuminate strategies for selective therapeutic targeting of PGC1α-dependent LRH-1 signaling pathways.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer in humans. The focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK) is often over-expressed in human HCC and FAK inhibition may reduce HCC cell invasiveness. However, the anti-oncogenic effect of FAK knockdown in HCC cells remains to be clarified. We found that FAK depletion in HCC cells reduced in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity, by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis, decreasing anchorage-independent growth, and modulating the expression of several cancer-related genes. Among these genes, we showed that FAK silencing decreased transcription and nuclear localization of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and its tri-methylation activity on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). Accordingly, FAK, EZH2 and H3K27me3 were concomitantly upregulated in human HCCs compared to non-tumor livers. In vitro experiments demonstrated that FAK affected EZH2 expression and function by modulating, at least in part, p53 and E2F2/3 transcriptional activity. Moreover, FAK silencing downregulated both EZH2 binding and histone H3K27me3 levels at the promoter of its target gene NOTCH2. Finally, we found that pharmacological inhibition of FAK activity resembled these effects although milder. In summary, we demonstrate that FAK depletion reduces HCC cell growth by affecting cancer-promoting genes including the pro-oncogene EZH2. Furthermore, we unveil a novel unprecedented FAK/EZH2 crosstalk in HCC cells, thus identifying a targetable network paving the way for new anticancer therapies.
Since interactome analysis of diseases can provide candidate biomarker panel related to the diseases, in this research, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis is used to introduce the involved crucial proteins in Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA).
Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) is the most common type of stomach cancer. There is no efficient diagnostic molecular method for GA.
Applying Cytoscape software 3.4.0 and String Database, the PPI network was constructed for 200 genes. Based on centrality parameters, the critical nodes were screened. Gene ontology of the key proteins for pathway analysis and molecular function processing were done and the highlighted pathways and activities were discussed.
Among 200 initial genes, 141 genes were included in a main connected network. Seven crucial proteins, including tumor protein p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, albumin, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian) and catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88kDa, and Myogenic differentiation 1, were introduced as key nodes of the network. These identified proteins are mostly involved in pathways and activities related to cancer.
In conclusion, the finding is corresponding to the significant roles of these introduced proteins in GA disease. This protein panel may be a useful probe in the management of GA.
BACKGROUND In clinics, patients with type 2 diabetes complicated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have been shown to receive significant improvements in blood glucose levels, lipid levels, and liver function after sitagliptin treatment, although the mechanism of drug action remains poorly understood. This study investigated the possible mechanism of sitagliptin on lipid metabolism of NAFLD mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS Male C57/BL6 mice were induced for NAFLD via 16 weeks of a high-fat diet, and were treated with 15 mg/kg/day sitagliptin for 16 consecutive weeks. Blood lipid levels were measured and samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and oil red staining for liver pathology and lipid deposition. Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-9 and FGF-21 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, and cAMP reactive element binding homolog (CREBH) were measured by Western blotting, while fatty acid synthase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) mRNA levels were assayed by RT-PCR. RESULTS Compared to the control group, the NAFLD model mice had liver fatty disease, lower serum FGF-21 and FGF-19 levels, elevated serum lipid levels, depressed PPAR-α, CREBH, and CPT1 expression, and enhanced FAS expression (p&lt;0.05). Sitagliptin treatment depressed blood lipid levels, increased serum FGF-21 and FGF-19 levels, PPAR-α, CREBH, and CPT1 expression, and suppressed FAS expression (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS Sitagliptin can protect liver tissue and modulate lipid metabolism in NAFLD mice via elevating FGF-21 and FGF-19, upregulating liver PPAR-a and CREBH levels, and mediating expression levels of key enzymes for lipid metabolism.
Nearly all older men will experience lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the etiology of which is not well understood. We have generated Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice by conditional deletion of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) tumor suppressor gene, Stk11 (serine threonine kinase 11), in the fetal Müllerian duct mesenchyme (MDM), the caudal remnant of which is thought to be assimilated by the urogenital sinus primordial mesenchyme in males during fetal development. We show that MDM cells contribute to the postnatal stromal cells at the dorsal aspect of the prostatic urethra by lineage tracing. The Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice develop prostatic hyperplasia with bladder outlet obstruction, most likely because of stromal expansion. The stromal areas from prostates of Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice, with or without significant expansion, were estrogen receptor positive, which is consistent with both MD mesenchyme-derived cells and the purported importance of estrogen receptors in BPH development and/or progression. In some cases, stromal hyperplasia was admixed with epithelial metaplasia, sometimes with keratin pearls, consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. Mice with conditional deletion of both Stk11 and Pten developed similar features as the Stk11
                        CKO
                     mice, but at a highly accelerated rate, often within the first few months after birth. Western blot analyses showed that the loss of LKB1 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) induces activation of the phospho-5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and phospho-AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 signaling pathways, as well as increased total and active β-catenin. These results suggest that activation of these signaling pathways can induce hyperplasia of the MD stroma, which could play a significant role in the etiology of human BPH.
Leydig cells (LCs) in the adult testis have been identified as the major sites of oestrogen production, which is crucial for mammalian germ cell differentiation. Our previous work showed that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) inhibits estradiol (E2) secretion via down-regulating Cyp19 gene expression in mature rat LCs. However, the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the effects of TGFB1 on the expression levels of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM) were evaluated both in primary cultured LCs and in rat testis. The involvement of TGFB1 signalling in the regulation of SF1 and LRH1 expression was then validated by applying the inhibitor of the TGFB type 1 receptor (TGFBR1) SB431542. Moreover, the expression of CYP19 in testicular LCs was investigated and the production of E2 in testicular interstitial fluid (TIF) was measured. The results showed that TGFB1 especially down-regulated the expression levels of SF1 and LRH1 both in primary cultured LCs and in rat testis. The down-regulations of TGFB1 in the production of E2 in TIF and the expression of CYP19 in testicular LCs were also observed in vivo These inhibitory effects could be reversed by TGFBR1 inhibitor SB431542. Our findings suggest that TGFB1 may act through the canonical signalling pathway involving ALK5 to restrain SF1 and LRH1 accumulation and eventually attenuate Cyp19 transcription and oestrogen production in LCs.
Uncontrolled inflammatory response highlights the central theme of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a growing global pandemic. Hepatocytes and macrophages represent two major sources of hepatic inflammation during NASH pathogenesis, contributing to excessive synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. The epigenetic mechanism that accounts for the activation of hepatocytes and macrophages in this process remains obscure. Here, we report that compared to wild-type littermates, mice with a deficiency in the histone H3K9 methyltransferase suppressor of variegation 39 homolog 2 (Suv39h2, knockout) exhibited a less severe form of NASH induced by feeding with a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. Pro-NASH stimuli increased Suv39h2 expression in cell culture, in mice, and in human livers. In hepatocytes, Suv39h2 bound to the Sirt1 gene promoter and repressed Sirt1 transcription. Suv39h2 deficiency normalized Sirt1 expression, allowing nuclear factor kappa B/p65 to become hypoacetylated and thus dampening nuclear factor kappa B-dependent transcription of proinflammatory mediators. In macrophages, Suv39h2-mediated repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma transcription favored a proinflammatory M1 phenotype over an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, thereby elevating hepatic inflammation.
Suv39h2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory response in hepatocytes and macrophages, contributing to NASH pathogenesis. (Hepatology 2017;65:1904-1919).
The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deleted on chromosome 10 plays an important role in regulating T cell activation during inflammatory response. Activation of β-catenin is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. This study investigates the functional roles and molecular mechanisms by which PTEN-β-catenin signaling promotes regulatory T cell (Treg) induction in a mouse model of liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). We found that mice with myeloid-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog knockout (PTENM-KO ) exhibited reduced liver damage as evidenced by decreased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, intrahepatic macrophage trafficking, and proinflammatory mediators compared with the PTEN-proficient (floxed phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTENFL/FL ]) controls. Disruption of myeloid PTEN-activated b-catenin promoted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-mediated Jagged-1/Notch signaling and induced forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)1 Tregs while inhibiting T helper 17 cells. However, blocking of Notch signaling by inhibiting γ-secretase reversed myeloid PTEN deficiency-mediated protection in ischemia/reperfusion-triggered liver inflammation with reduced FOXP3+ and increased retinoid A receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t-mediated interleukin 17A expression in ischemic livers. Moreover, knockdown of β-catenin or PPARγ in PTEN-deficient macrophages inhibited Jagged-1/Notch activation and reduced FOXP3+ Treg induction, leading to increased proinflammatory mediators in macrophage/T cell cocultures. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PTEN-β-catenin signaling is a novel regulator involved in modulating Treg development and provides a potential therapeutic target in liver IRI.

Reduced expression of the Indy ("I am Not Dead, Yet") gene in lower organisms promotes longevity in a manner akin to caloric restriction. Deletion of the mammalian homolog of Indy (mIndy, Slc13a5) encoding for a plasma membrane-associated citrate transporter expressed highly in the liver, protects mice from high-fat diet-induced and aging-induced obesity and hepatic fat accumulation through a mechanism resembling caloric restriction. We studied a possible role of mIndy in human hepatic fat metabolism. In obese, insulin-resistant patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic mIndy expression was increased and mIndy expression was also independently associated with hepatic steatosis. In nonhuman primates, a 2-year high-fat, high-sucrose diet increased hepatic mIndy expression. Liver microarray analysis showed that high mIndy expression was associated with pathways involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and immunological processes. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was identified as a regulator of mIndy by binding to its cognate receptor. Studies in human primary hepatocytes confirmed that IL-6 markedly induced mIndy transcription through the IL-6 receptor and activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and a putative start site of the human mIndy promoter was determined. Activation of the IL-6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway stimulated mIndy expression, enhanced cytoplasmic citrate influx, and augmented hepatic lipogenesis in vivo. In contrast, deletion of mIndy completely prevented the stimulating effect of IL-6 on citrate uptake and reduced hepatic lipogenesis. These data show that mIndy is increased in liver of obese humans and nonhuman primates with NALFD. Moreover, our data identify mIndy as a target gene of IL-6 and determine novel functions of IL-6 through mINDY.
Targeting human mINDY may have therapeutic potential in obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00005450. (Hepatology 2017;66:616-630).
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a vasoprotective lipid mediator. About two thirds of plasma S1P rides on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and several pleiotropic properties of HDL have been ascribed to S1P. In human subjects, CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) greatly influences HDL quantities. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the roles of CETP in the metabolism of S1P.
We overexpressed CETP in mice that lacked CETP and found that CETP overexpression decreased the HDL level but failed to modulate the levels of S1P and apolipoprotein M (apoM), a carrier of S1P, in the total plasma. We observed, however, that the distribution of S1P and apoM shifted from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins. When we administered C17S1P bound to apoM-containing lipoprotein, C17S1P and apoM were rapidly transferred to apoB-containing lipoproteins in CETP-overexpressing mice. When HDL containing C17S1P was mixed with low-density lipoprotein ex vivo, C17S1P shifted to the low-density lipoprotein fraction independent of the presence of CETP. Concordant with these results, apoM was distributed mainly to the same fraction as apo AI in a CETP-deficient subject, although apoM was also detected in apo AI-poor fractions in a corresponding hypercholesterolemia subject. About the bioactivities of S1P carried on each lipoprotein, S1P riding on apoB-containing lipoproteins induced the phosphorylation of Akt (AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog) and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and CETP overexpression increased insulin secretion and sensitivity, which was inhibited by an S1P receptor 1 or 3 antagonist.
CETP modulates the distribution of S1P among lipoproteins, which affects the bioactivities of S1P.
Hepatic steatosis is caused by metabolic imbalances that could be explained in part by an increase in de novo lipogenesis that results from increased sterol element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity. The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is an important regulator of intermediary metabolism in the liver, but its role in regulating lipogenesis is not well understood. Here, we have assessed the contribution of LRH-1 SUMOylation to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mice expressing a SUMOylation-defective mutant of LRH-1 (LRH-1 K289R mice) developed NAFLD and early signs of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) when challenged with a lipogenic, high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Moreover, we observed that the LRH-1 K289R mutation induced the expression of oxysterol binding protein-like 3 (OSBPL3), enhanced SREBP-1 processing, and promoted de novo lipogenesis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of OSBPL3 facilitates SREBP-1 processing in WT mice, while silencing hepatic Osbpl3 reverses the lipogenic phenotype of LRH-1 K289R mice. These findings suggest that compromised SUMOylation of LRH-1 promotes the development of NAFLD under lipogenic conditions through regulation of OSBPL3.
Liver diseases are major global health problems. Ginseng extract has antioxidant, immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. This study investigated the effect of ginseng extract on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats.
Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group, ginseng group, CCl4 group and CCl4 + ginseng group. Liver injury was induced by the intraperitoneal (I.P) injection of 3 ml/kg CCl4 (30% in olive oil) weekly for 8 weeks. The control group was I.P injected with olive oil. The expression of genes encoding transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-1), type II TGF-β receptor (TβR-II), mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (Smad2), Smad3, Smad4, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP9, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), Collagen 1a2 (Col1a2), Collagen 3a1 (Col3a1), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured by real-time PCR.
Treatment with ginseng extract decreased hepatic fat deposition and lowered hepatic reticular fiber accumulation compared with the CCl4 group. The CCl4 group showed a significant increase in hepatotoxicity biomarkers and up-regulation of the expression of genes encoding TGF-β, TβR-I, TβR-II, MMP2, MMP9, Smad-2,-3, -4, and IL-8 compared with the control group. However, CCl4 administration resulted in the significant down-regulation of IL-10 mRNA expression compared with the control group. Interestingly, ginseng extract supplementation completely reversed the biochemical markers of hepatotoxicity and the gene expression alterations induced by CCl4.
ginseng extract had an anti-fibrosis effect via the regulation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in the CCl4-induced liver fibrosis model. The major target was the inhibition of the expression of TGF-β1, Smad2, and Smad3.
The fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5)/Irisin, a novel energy-regulating hormone, is associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. It is produced in low amounts by normal hepatic tissue, while in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which aberrant de novo lipogenesis (DNL) occurs, the hepatic expression of FNDC5/Irisin is still unknown. The gene expression of FNDC5/Irisin, associated to key regulators of DNL, inflammation and cancer progression was evaluated in liver tissue of 18 patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation and of 18 deceased donors. Hepatic mRNA expression of FNDC5/Irisin and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), main enzymatic regulator of DNL, were significantly higher in HCC patients than in donors (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.015, respectively). The hepatic mRNA expression of the neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) tended to be higher in HCC patients than in donors (p=0.06). Only in HCC patients, hepatic FNDC5/Irisin strongly correlated with the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding factor 1, SCD-1, NOTCH1, tumor necrosis factor-α and Interleukin-6 mRNA expression. Further, in HCC patients, FNDC5/Irisin mRNA tended to correlate to plasma lipid profile namely triglycerides, palmitic/linoleic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratios. In conclusion, HCC-liver tissue over-expressed FNDC5/Irisin in association with gene expression of mediators involved in lipogenesis, inflammation and cancer, suggesting a possible protective role of the hormone from the liver damage.
The proliferative-crypt compartment of the intestinal epithelium is enriched in phospholipids and accumulation of phospholipids has been described in colorectal tumors. Here we hypothesize that biliary phospholipid flow could directly contribute to the proliferative power of normal and dysplastic enterocytes. We used Abcb4-/- mice which lack biliary phospholipid secretion. We first show that Abcb4-/- mice are protected against intestinal tumorigenesis. At the molecular level, the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (Lrh1) is reduced in Abcb4-/- mice and its re-activation re-establishes a tumor burden comparable to control mice. Feeding Abcb4-/- mice a diet supplemented with phospholipids completely overcomes the intestinal tumor protective phenotype, thus corroborating the hypothesis that the absence of biliary phospholipids and not lack of Abcb4 gene per se is responsible for the protection. In turn, phospholipids cannot re-establish intestinal tumorigenesis in Abcb4-/- mice crossed with mice with intestinal specific ablation of Lrh1, a nuclear hormone receptor that is activates by phospholipids. Our data identify the key role of biliary phospholipids in sustaining intestinal mucosa proliferation and tumor progression through the activation of nuclear receptor Lrh1.
Oct4 is a transcription factor required for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in stem cells. Prior to differentiation, Oct4 must be silenced to allow for the development of the three germ layers in the developing embryo. This fine-tuning is controlled by the nuclear receptors (NRs), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF). Liver receptor homolog-1 is responsible for driving the expression of Oct4 where GCNF represses its expression upon differentiation. Both receptors bind to a DR0 motif located within the Oct4 promoter. Here, we present the first structure of mouse GCNF DNA-binding domain in complex with the Oct4 DR0. The overall structure revealed two molecules bound in a head-to-tail fashion on opposite sides of the DNA. Additionally, we solved the structure of the human LRH-1 DNA-binding domain bound to the same element. We explore the structural elements that govern Oct4 recognition by these two NRs.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reportedly involved in gastric cancer development and progression. In particular, miR-219-5p has been reported to be a tumor-associated miRNA in human cancer. However, the role of miR-219-5p in gastric cancer remains unclear. In this study, we investigated for the first time the potential role and underlying mechanism of miR-219-5p in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human gastric cancer cells. miR-219-5p was found to be markedly decreased in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent tissues and normal gastric epithelial cells. miR-219-5p mimics or anti-miR-219-5p was transfected into gastric cancer cell lines to overexpress or suppress miR-219-5p expression, respectively. Results showed that miR-219-5p overexpression significantly decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Conversely, miR-219-5p suppression demonstrated a completely opposite effect. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-219-5p targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a well-characterized oncogene. Furthermore, miR-219-5p inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of LRH-1. LRH-1 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with miR-219-5p expression in gastric cancer tissues. miR-219-5p overexpression significantly decreased the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells. Additionally, LRH-1 restoration can markedly reverse miR-219-5p-mediated tumor suppressive effects. Our study suggests that miR-219-5p regulated the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human gastric cancer cells by suppressing LRH-1. miR-219-5p may be a potential target for gastric cancer therapy.
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are frequently associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and with an elevated cancer incidence. The molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in this context are only partially understood. High blood insulin levels are typical in early T2DM and excessive insulin can cause elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and genomic instability. ROS are important for various cellular functions in signaling and host defense. However, elevated ROS formation is thought to be involved in cancer induction. In the molecular events from insulin receptor binding to genomic damage, some signaling steps have been identified, pointing at the PI3K/AKT pathway. For further elucidation Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (Pten), a tumour suppressor phosphatase that plays a role in insulin signaling by negative regulation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream targets, was investigated here. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining was used to detect ROS formation in immortalized human hepatocytes. Comet assay and micronucleus test were performed to investigate genomic damage in vitro. In liver samples, DHE staining and western blot detection of HSP70 and HO-1 were performed to evaluate oxidative stress response. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were detected by immunohistostaining. Inhibition of PTEN with the pharmacologic inhibitor VO-OHpic resulted in increased ROS production and genomic damage in a liver cell line. Knockdown of Pten in a mouse model yielded increased oxidative stress levels, detected by ROS levels and expression of the two stress-proteins HSP70 and HO-1 and elevated genomic damage in the liver, which was significant in mice fed with a high fat diet. We conclude that PTEN is involved in oxidative stress and genomic damage induction in vitro and that this may also explain the in vivo observations. This further supports the hypothesis that the PI3K/AKT pathway is responsible for damaging effects of high levels of insulin.
Insulin is known mainly for its effects in peripheral tissues, such as the liver, skeletal muscles and adipose tissue, where the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) has both short-term and long-term effects. Insulin and the IR are also present in the brain, and since there is evidence that neuronal insulin signaling regulates synaptic plasticity and that it is impaired in disease, this pathway might be the key to protection or reversal of symptoms, especially in Alzheimer's disease. However, there are controversies about the importance of the neuronal IR, partly because biophysical data on its activation and signaling are much less complete than for the peripheral IR. This review briefly summarizes the neuronal IR signaling in health and disease, and then focuses on known differences between the neuronal and peripheral IR with regard to alternative splicing and glycosylation, and lack of data with respect to phosphorylation and membrane subdomain localization. Particularities in the neuronal IR itself and its environment may have consequences for downstream signaling and impact synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, establishing the relative importance of insulin signaling through IR or through hybrids with its homolog, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, is crucial for evaluating the consequences of brain IR activation. An improved biophysical understanding of the neuronal IR may help predict the consequences of insulin-targeted interventions.
Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer (OM-CRC) often are unresponsive to chemotherapy and are associated with poor survival. To the authors' knowledge, the clinicopathologic and genomic predictors of OM-CRC are poorly characterized and optimal clinical management remains unclear.
Women with a histopathological diagnosis of OM-CRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1999 to 2015 were identified. Next-generation somatic mutation profiling (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) was performed on 38 OM-CRC cases, including 21 matched tumor pairs/trios. Regression models were used to analyze variables associated with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).
Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) mutations were more frequent in cases of OM-CRC than in instances of CRC occurring without OM. SMAD4 and lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations were associated with reduced OS. Matched multisite tumor sequencing did not identify OM-specific genomic alterations. Of the 195 patients who underwent oophorectomy for OM-CRC (median age, 49 years with a progression-free survival of 9.4 months and an OS of 23 months from oophorectomy), 76% had extraovarian metastasis (EOM). In multivariable analysis, residual disease after surgery (R2 resection) was associated with worse survival. Patients with EOM were less likely to achieve R0/R1 surgical resection status (complete macroscopic resection without clinical/radiological evidence of disease) (48% vs 94%). However, if R0/R1 resection status was achieved, both patients with (35.9 months vs 12 months) and without (43.2 months vs 14.5 months) EOM were found to have better OS. Among 114 patients with R0/R1 resection status, 23 (20%) had no disease recurrence, including 10 patients (9%) with &gt; 3 years of follow-up.
Loss-of-function alterations in SMAD4 are frequent and predictive of worse survival in patients with OM-CRC. Similar to oligometastatic CRC to the lung or liver, surgical resection of OM-CRC is associated with a better outcome only if all macroscopic metastatic disease is resected.

Lipotoxicity caused by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induces tissue damage and inflammation in metabolic disorders. SCD1 (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1) converts SFAs to mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) that are incorporated into triglycerides and stored in lipid droplets. SCD1 thus helps protect hepatocytes from lipotoxicity and its reduced expression is associated with increased lipotoxic injury in cultured hepatic cells and mouse models. To further understand the role of SCD1 in lipotoxicity, we examined the regulation of Scd1 in hepatic cells treated with palmitate, and found that NR1H/LXR (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H) ligand, GW3965, induced Scd1 expression and lipid droplet formation to improve cell survival. Surprisingly, ULK1/ATG1 (unc-51 like kinase) played a critical role in protecting hepatic cells from SFA-induced lipotoxicity via a novel mechanism that did not involve macroautophagy/autophagy. Specific loss of Ulk1 blocked the induction of Scd1 gene transcription by GW3965, decreased lipid droplet formation, and increased apoptosis in hepatic cells exposed to palmitate. Knockdown of ULK1 increased RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1) signaling that, in turn, induced NCOR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1) nuclear uptake, interaction with NR1H/LXR, and recruitment to the Scd1 promoter. These events abrogated the stimulation of Scd1 gene expression by GW3965, and increased lipotoxicity in hepatic cells. In summary, we have identified a novel autophagy-independent role of ULK1 that regulates NR1H/LXR signaling, Scd1 expression, and intracellular lipid homeostasis in hepatic cells exposed to a lipotoxic environment.
Tangshen formula (TSF), a well-prescribed traditional Chinese formula, has been used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. However, whether TSF ameliorates dyslipidemia and liver injury associated with diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of TSF on lipid profiles and hepatic steatosis in db/db mice. For this purpose, 8‑week-old db/db mice were treated with TSF or saline for 12 weeks via gavage and db/m mice were used as controls. Body weight and blood glucose levels were monitored weekly and bi-weekly, respectively. Blood samples were obtained for the analysis of lipids and enzymes related to hepatic function, and liver tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular examination. The results revealed that TSF markedly reduced body weight, liver index [liver/body weight (LW/BW)] and improved lipid profiles, hepatic function and steatosis in db/db mice. TSF induced the phosphoralation of AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibited the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 together with the inhibition of the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and gluconeogenesis, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1). Additionally, the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Sirt1)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)/malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD) cascade was potently activated by TSF in the liver and skeletal muscle of db/db mice, which led to enhanced fatty acid oxidation. These findings demonstrated that TSF attenuated hepatic fat accumulation and steatosis in db/db mice by inhibiting lipogenesis and augmenting fatty acid oxidation.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is now recognized as an important physiological regulator in the immune and reproductive systems, and in the development of the liver and vascular system. AhR regulates cell cycle, cell proliferation, and differentiation through interacting with other signaling pathways, like estrogen receptor α (ERα), androgen receptor (AR), and Notch signaling. In the present study, we investigated Notch and estrogen signaling in AhR-/- mice. We found low fertility with degenerative changes in the testes, germ cell apoptosis, and a reduced number of early spermatids. There was no change in aromatase, AR, ERα, or ERβ expression in the testis and no detectable change in serum estrogen levels. However, expression of Notch receptors (Notch1 and Notch3) and their target Hairy and Enhancer of Split homolog 1 (HES1) was reduced. In addition, the testosterone level was slightly reduced in the serum. In the mammary fat pad, AhR appeared to regulate estrogen signaling because, in AhR-/- males, there was significant growth of the mammary ducts with high expression of ERα in the ductal epithelium. The enhanced mammary ductal growth appears to be related to overexpression of ERα accompanied by a high proliferation index, whereas the reduced fertility appears to be related defects in Notch signaling that leads to reduced expression of HES1 and, consequently, early maturation of spermatocytes and a depletion of primary spermatids. Previous reports have indicated that AhR pathway is associated with infertility in men. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for this defect.
Sirtuin1 (Sirt1; mammalian homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme Sir2) is a transcriptional and transactivational regulator of murine farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), which is the primary bile acid (BA) sensor, and critical regulator of BA metabolism in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Previous studies have suggested compromised Sirt1 expression in rodent models of cholestatic liver injury. We hypothesized that Sirt1 could be potentially targeted to alleviate cholestatic liver injury. In cultured primary human hepatocytes, SIRT1 messenger RNA was down-regulated after GCA treatment, potentially through induction of microRNA (miR)-34a, whereas tauroursodeoxycholic acid induced SIRT1 expression without affecting miR-34a expression. Sirt1 expression was also significantly down-regulated in three mouse models of liver injury (bile duct ligation, 1% cholic acid [CA] fed, and the Mdr2-/- mouse). Mice fed CA diet also demonstrated hepatic FXR hyperacetylation and induction of the Janus kinase/p53 pathway. Mice fed a CA diet and concurrently administered the Sirt1 activator, SRT1720 (50 mg/kg/day, orally), demonstrated 40% and 45% decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase and BA levels, respectively. SRT1720 increased hepatic BA hydrophilicity by increasing tri- and tetrahydroxylated and decreasing the dihydroxylated BA fraction. SRT1720 administration also inhibited hepatic BA synthesis, potentially through ileal fibroblast growth factor 15- and Fxr-mediated inhibition of cytochrome p450 (Cyp) 7a1 and Cyp27a1, along with increased hepatic BA hydroxylation in association with Cyp2b10 induction. SRT1720 administration significantly induced renal multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α, and constitutive androstance receptor expression along with ∼2-fold increase in urinary BA concentrations.
SRT1720 administration alleviates cholestatic liver injury in mice by increasing hydrophilicity of hepatic BA composition and decreasing plasma BA concentration through increased BA excretion into urine. Thus, use of small-molecule activators of Sirt1 presents a novel therapeutic target for cholestatic liver injury. (Hepatology 2016;64:2151-2164).
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental contaminant and high-affinity ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Increasing evidence indicates that AhR signaling contributes to wound healing, which involves the coordinated deposition and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. In the liver, wound healing is attributed to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which mediate fibrogenesis through the production of soluble mediators and collagen type I. We recently reported that TCDD treatment increases the activation of human HSCs in vitro. The goal of this study was to determine how TCDD impacts HSC activation in vivo using a mouse model of experimental liver fibrosis. To elicit fibrosis, C57BL6/male mice were treated twice weekly for 8weeks with 0.5ml/kg carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). TCDD (20μg/kg) or peanut oil (vehicle) was administered once a week during the last 2weeks. Results indicate that TCDD increased liver-body-weight ratios, serum alanine aminotransferase activity, and hepatic necroinflammation in CCl4-treated mice. Likewise, TCDD treatment increased mRNA expression of HSC activation and fibrogenesis genes, namely α-smooth muscle actin, desmin, delta-like homolog-1, TGF-β1, and collagen type I. However, TCDD treatment did not exacerbate fibrosis, nor did it increase the collagen content of the liver. Instead, TCDD increased hepatic collagenase activity and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and the matrix regulatory proteins, TIMP-1 and PAI-1. These results support the conclusion that TCDD increases CCl4-induced liver damage and exacerbates HSC activation, yet collagen deposition and the development of fibrosis may be limited by TCDD-mediated changes in extracellular matrix remodeling.
The Hippo pathway regulates the down-stream target Yes-associated protein (YAP) to maintain organ homeostasis, which is commonly inactivated in many types of cancers. However, how cell adhesion dysregulates the Hippo pathway activating YAP oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Our findings demonstrate that α2β1 integrin (but not other β1 integrins) expressed in HCC cells, after binding to collagen extracellular matrix, could inhibit MST1 kinase phosphorylation and activate YAP pro-oncogenic activities. Knockdown of integrin α2 gene (ITGA2) suppressed YAP targeted gene expression in vitro. α2β1 and collagen binding resulted in suppressing Hippo signaling of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) and Large tumor suppressor homolog 1 (LATS1) with concomitant activation of YAP-mediated connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene expression. In vitro kinase assay showed that MST1 is an immediate downstream target of integrin α2 with S1180 residue as the critical phosphorylation site. Clinical correlational analysis using a gene expression dataset of 228 HCC tumors revealed that ITGA2 expression was significantly associated with tumor progression, and co-expression with YAP targeted genes (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, CTGF, cyclin D1, glypican 3, insulin like growth factor 1 receptor, and SRY-box 4) correlated with survivals of HCC patients. In conclusion, α2β1 integrin activation through cellular adhesion impacts the Hippo pathway in solid tumors and modulates MST1-YAP signaling cascade. Targeting integrin α2 holds promises for treating YAP-positive HCC.
Receptor tyrosine kinases MET and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are critically involved in initiation of liver regeneration. Other cytokines and signaling molecules also participate in the early part of the process. Regeneration employs effective redundancy schemes to compensate for the missing signals. Elimination of any single extracellular signaling pathway only delays but does not abolish the process. Our present study, however, shows that combined systemic elimination of MET and EGFR signaling (MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice) abolishes liver regeneration, prevents restoration of liver mass, and leads to liver decompensation. MET knockout or simply EGFR-inhibited mice had distinct and signaling-specific alterations in Ser/Thr phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, phosphatase and tensin homolog, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α, etc. In the combined MET and EGFR signaling elimination of MET knockout + EGFR-inhibited mice, however, alterations dependent on either MET or EGFR combined to create shutdown of many programs vital to hepatocytes. These included decrease in expression of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism, urea cycle, cell replication, and mitochondrial functions and increase in expression of glycolysis enzymes. There was, however, increased expression of genes of plasma proteins. Hepatocyte average volume decreased to 35% of control, with a proportional decrease in the dimensions of the hepatic lobules. Mice died at 15-18 days after hepatectomy with ascites, increased plasma ammonia, and very small livers.
MET and EGFR separately control many nonoverlapping signaling endpoints, allowing for compensation when only one of the signals is blocked, though the combined elimination of the signals is not tolerated; the results provide critical new information on interactive MET and EGFR signaling and the contribution of their combined absence to regeneration arrest and liver decompensation.

Liver receptor homolog 1 (NR5A2, LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that regulates diverse biological processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and the resolution of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Although preclinical and cellular studies demonstrate that LRH-1 has great potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases and cancer, development of LRH-1 modulators has been difficult. Recently, systematic modifications to one of the few known chemical scaffolds capable of activating LRH-1 failed to improve efficacy substantially. Moreover, mechanisms through which LRH-1 is activated by synthetic ligands are entirely unknown. Here, we use x-ray crystallography and other structural methods to explore conformational changes and receptor-ligand interactions associated with LRH-1 activation by a set of related agonists. Unlike phospholipid LRH-1 ligands, these agonists bind deep in the pocket and do not interact with residues near the mouth nor do they expand the pocket like phospholipids. Unexpectedly, two closely related agonists with similar efficacies (GSK8470 and RJW100) exhibit completely different binding modes. The dramatic repositioning is influenced by a differential ability to establish stable face-to-face π-π-stacking with the LRH-1 residue His-390, as well as by a novel polar interaction mediated by the RJW100 hydroxyl group. The differing binding modes result in distinct mechanisms of action for the two agonists. Finally, we identify a network of conserved water molecules near the ligand-binding site that are important for activation by both agonists. This work reveals a previously unappreciated complexity associated with LRH-1 agonist development and offers insights into rational design strategies.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms of chronic rejection of transplanted organs remain obscure; however, macrophages are known to play a critical role in the injury and repair of allografts. Among multiple factors influencing macrophage infiltration to allografts, the fractalkine chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1(CX3CL1)/chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 (CX3CR1) signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by a small guanosine-5׳-triphosphatase Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), are of the utmost importance. To define the role of macrophage/RhoA pathway involvement in chronic rejection, we generated mice with monocyte/macrophage-specific deletion of RhoA.
Hearts from BALB/c (H-2d) donors were transplanted into RhoAflox/flox (no Cre) and heterozygous Lyz2Cre+/-RhoAflox/flox recipients treated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 immunoglobulin to inhibit early T-cell response. Allografts were assessed for chronic rejection and monocyte/macrophage functions.
The deletion of RhoA inhibited macrophage infiltration, neointimal hyperplasia of vasculature, and abrogated chronic rejection of the allografts. The RhoA deletion downregulated G protein-coupled fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, which activates the RhoA pathway and controls monocyte/macrophage trafficking into the vascular endothelium. This in turn promotes, through overproliferation and differentiation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial walls, neointimal hyperplasia.
Our finding of codependence of chronic rejection on monocyte/macrophage CX3CR1/CX3CL1 and RhoA signaling pathways may lead to the development of novel anti-chronic rejection therapies.
Steroid hormones are mainly produced in adrenal glands and gonads. Because steroid hormones play vital roles in various physiological processes, replacement of deficient steroid hormones by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is necessary for patients with adrenal and gonadal failure. In addition to HRT, tissue regeneration using stem cells is predicted to provide novel therapy. Among various stem cell types, mesenchymal stem cells can be differentiated into steroidogenic cells following ectopic expression of nuclear receptor (NR) 5A subfamily proteins, steroidogenic factor-1 (also known as adrenal 4 binding protein) and liver receptor homolog-1, with the aid of cAMP signaling. Conversely, these approaches cannot be applied to pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, because of poor survival following cytotoxic expression of NR5A subfamily proteins. However, if pluripotent stem cells are first differentiated through mesenchymal lineage, they can also be differentiated into steroidogenic cells via NR5A subfamily protein expression. This approach offers a potential suitable cells for future regenerative medicine and gene therapy for diseases caused by steroidogenesis deficiencies. It represents a powerful tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in steroidogenesis. This article highlights our own and current research on the induction of steroidogenic cells from various stem cells. We also discuss the future direction of their clinical application.
The role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in liver fibrosis or inflammation was not fully examined in human. Controversy exists which S1P receptors, S1P1 and S1P3 vs S1P2, would be importantly involved in its mechanism. To clarify these matters, 80 patients who received liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma and 9 patients for metastatic liver tumor were enrolled. S1P metabolism was analyzed in background, non-tumorous liver tissue. mRNA levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) but not SK2 were increased in livers with fibrosis stages 3-4 compared to those with 0-2 and to normal liver. However, S1P was not increased in advanced fibrotic liver, where mRNA levels of S1P transporter spinster homolog 2 (SPNS2) but not S1P-degrading enzymes were enhanced. Furthermore, mRNA levels of S1P2 but not S1P1 or S1P3 were increased in advanced fibrotic liver. These increased mRNA levels of SK1, SPNS2 and S1P2 in fibrotic liver were correlated with α-smooth muscle actin mRNA levels in liver, and with serum ALT levels. In conclusion, S1P may be actively generated, transported to outside the cells, and bind to its specific receptor in human liver to play a role in fibrosis or inflammation. Altered S1P metabolism in fibrotic liver may be their therapeutic target.
The stepwise progression of common endoderm progenitors into differentiated liver and pancreas organs is regulated by a dynamic array of signals that are not well understood. The nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 gene nr5a2, also known as Liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) is expressed in several tissues including the developing liver and pancreas. Here, we interrogate the role of Nr5a2 at multiple developmental stages using genetic and chemical approaches and uncover novel pleiotropic requirements during zebrafish liver and pancreas development. Zygotic loss of nr5a2 in a targeted genetic null mutant disrupted the development of the exocrine pancreas and liver, while leaving the endocrine pancreas intact. Loss of nr5a2 abrogated exocrine pancreas markers such as trypsin, while pancreas progenitors marked by ptf1a or pdx1 remained unaffected, suggesting a role for Nr5a2 in regulating pancreatic acinar cell differentiation. In the developing liver, Nr5a2 regulates hepatic progenitor outgrowth and differentiation, as nr5a2 mutants exhibited reduced hepatoblast markers hnf4α and prox1 as well as differentiated hepatocyte marker fabp10a. Through the first in vivo use of Nr5a2 chemical antagonist Cpd3, the iterative requirement for Nr5a2 for exocrine pancreas and liver differentiation was temporally elucidated: chemical inhibition of Nr5a2 function during hepatopancreas progenitor specification was sufficient to disrupt exocrine pancreas formation and enhance the size of the embryonic liver, suggesting that Nr5a2 regulates hepatic vs. pancreatic progenitor fate choice. Chemical inhibition of Nr5a2 at a later time during pancreas and liver differentiation was sufficient to block the formation of mature acinar cells and hepatocytes. These findings define critical iterative and pleiotropic roles for Nr5a2 at distinct stages of pancreas and liver organogenesis, and provide novel perspectives for interpreting the role of Nr5a2 in disease.
Conventional efforts relying on high-throughput physical and virtual screening of large compound libraries have failed to yield high-efficiency chemical probes for many of the 48 human nuclear receptors. Here, we investigated whether disulfide-trapping, an approach new to nuclear receptors, would provide effective lead compounds targeting human liver receptor homolog 1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Despite the fact that hLRH-1 contains a large ligand binding pocket and binds phospholipids with high affinity, existing synthetic hLRH-1 ligands are of limited utility due to poor solubility, low efficacy or significant off-target effects. Using disulfide-trapping, we identified a lead compound that conjugates with remarkably high-efficiency to a native cysteine residue (Cys346) lining the hydrophobic cavity in the ligand binding domain of hLRH-1. Guided by computational modeling and cellular assays, the lead compound was elaborated into ligands PME8 and PME9 that bind hLRH-1 reversibly (no cysteine reactivity) and increase hLRH-1 activity in cells. When compared with the existing hLRH-1 synthetic agonist RJW100, both PME8 and PME9 showed comparable induction of the LRH-1 dependent target gene CYP24A1 in human HepG2 cells, beginning as early as 3 h after drug treatment. The induction is specific as siRNA-mediated knock-down of hLRH-1 renders both PME8 and PME9 ineffective. These data show that PME8 and PME9 are potent activators of hLRH-1 and suggest that with further development this lead series may yield useful chemical probes for manipulating LRH-1 activity in vivo. 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder hallmarked by excessive lipid deposits. Based on our recent research on lipid droplet (LD) formation in hepatocytes, we investigated LD-associated gene regulations in NAFLD of different grades, that is, steatosis vs steatohepatitis by comparing liver biopsies from healthy controls (N = 13) and NAFLD patients (N = 102). On average, more than 700 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified of which 146 are mechanistically linked to LD formation. We identified 51 LD-associated DEGs frequently regulated in patient samples (range ≥5 to ≤102) with the liver-receptor homolog-1(NR5A2), that is, a key regulator of cholesterol metabolism being commonly repressed among 100 patients examined. With bland steatosis, notable regulations involved hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated-protein and diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase-2 renowned for their role in LD-growth. Conversely, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-associated DEGs coded for epidermal growth factor receptor and TLR4 signaling with decreased expression of the GTPase Rab5 and the lipid phosphohydrolase PPAP2B thus highlighting adaptive responses to inflammation, LDL-mediated endocytosis and lipogenesis, respectively. Studies with steatotic primary human hepatocyte cultures demonstrated induction of LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, DNAAF1, whereas repressed expression of CPT1A, ANGPTL4, and PKLR informed on burdened mitochondrial metabolism. Equally, repressed expression of the B-lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13 and STAT4 as well as induced FGF21 evidenced amelioration of steatosis-related inflammation. In-vitro/in-vivo patient sample comparisons confirmed C-reactive protein, SOCS3, NR5A2, and SOD2 as commonly regulated. Lastly, STRING network analysis highlighted potential "druggable" targets with PLIN2, CIDEC, and hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated-protein being confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, steatosis and steatohepatitis specific gene regulations informed on the pathogenesis of NAFLD to broaden the perspective of targeted therapies.
Various tumors develop addiction to glutamine to support uncontrolled cell proliferation. Here we identify the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) as a key regulator in the process of hepatic tumorigenesis through the coordination of a noncanonical glutamine pathway that is reliant on the mitochondrial and cytosolic transaminases glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1), which fuel anabolic metabolism. In particular, we show that gain and loss of function of hepatic LRH-1 modulate the expression and activity of mitochondrial glutaminase 2 (GLS2), the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway. Acute and chronic deletion of hepatic LRH-1 blunts the deamination of glutamine and reduces glutamine-dependent anaplerosis. The robust reduction in glutaminolysis and the limiting availability of α-ketoglutarate in turn inhibit mTORC1 signaling to eventually block cell growth and proliferation. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of LRH-1 in coordinating glutamine-induced metabolism and signaling to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
Liver fibrosis is a worldwide problem with a significant morbidity and mortality. Cryptolepis sanguinolenta (family Periplocaceae) is widely used in West African countries for the treatment of malaria, as well as for some other diseases. However, the role of C. sanguinolenta in hepatic fibrosis is still unknown. It has been reported that Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) had a high expression in liver fibrosis and played a central role in its pathobiology. Interestingly, we found that a cryptolepine derivative (HZ-6h) could inhibit liver fibrosis by reducing MeCP2 expression, as evidenced by the dramatic downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen alpha-1 (Col1α1) in protein levels in vitro. Meanwhile, we also found that HZ-6h could reduce the cell viability and promote apoptosis of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) treated with transforming growth factor beta 1(TGF-β1). Then, we investigated the potential molecular mechanisms and found that HZ-6h blocked Shh signaling in HSC-T6 cells, resulting in the decreased protein expression of Patched-1 (PTCH-1), Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1). In short, these results indicate that HZ-6h inhibits liver fibrosis by downregulating MeCP2 through the Shh pathway in TGF-β1-induced HSC-T6 cells. 
The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR), which is expressed mainly in hepatocytes, is downregulated in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we investigated the role of ASGR1 in HCC metastasis as well as the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that ASGR1 was downregulated in HCC tissue compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue and that lower ASGR1 expression was associated with higher TNM stage and poorer prognosis in HCC patients. ASGR1 overexpression inhibited hepatoma cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, while ASGR1 knockdown had the opposite effects. Furthermore, ASGR1 interacted directly with human longevity assurance homolog 2 of yeast LAG1 (LASS2). Knockdown of LASS2 attenuated the inhibitory effects of ASGR1 on hepatoma cell migration and invasion in vitro. ASGR1 decreased V-ATPase activity in hepatoma cells, and this was reversed by LASS2 knockdown. Finally, HCC patients with low LASS2 levels had poor prognosis, while those with high ASGR1 and LASS2 levels had better prognosis. Thus, ASGR1 may act as a potential metastasis suppressor in HCC, and the combination of ASGR1 and LASS2 may help predict the prognosis of HCC patients.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH1) has been shown to promote tumor proliferation and development. However, the functions of LRH1 in mediating cancer cells chemoresistance are still not clear. Here, we found LRH1 levels were significantly elevated in primary breast cancer tissues in patients who developed early recurrence. Similarly, adriamycin (ADR)-resistant breast cancer cell lines also exerted high LRH1 expression. Indeed, overexpression of LRH1 attenuated cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs ADR and cisplatin (DDP) in breast cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice tumor model. Comet and BrdU assays showed overexpression of LRH1 blocked breast cancer cells DNA damage by chemotherapeutic drug, whereas depletion of LRH1 enhanced DNA damage. Remarkably, knockdown of LRH1 decreased the levels and foci of DNA damage marker γH2AX induced by ADR and DDP. Furthermore, plasmid end-joining assay indicated that knockdown of LRH1 significantly decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated double-strand break (DSB) repair efficiencies. Afterwards, we provided evidences that LRH1 promoted MDC1 transcription by directly activating MDC1 promoter and therefore increased γH2AX levels. Importantly, a LRH1-binding site mapped between -1812 and -1804 bp of the proximal MDC1 promoter was identified. Moreover, LRH1 and MDC1 mRNA levels were positively correlated in recurrent breast cancer samples. These results implied LRH1 enhanced breast cancer cell chemoresistance by upregulating MDC1 and attenuating DNA damage. Additionally, we elucidated the coactivator NCOA3 acted synergistically with LRH1 to promote MDC1 expression and chemoresistance. Altogether, LRH1-MDC1 signaling might be considered as a novel molecular target for designing novel therapeutic regimen in chemotherapy resistance breast cancer.
Excess lipid accumulation is an early signature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) (encoded by NR5A2) is suppressed in human NAFLD, evidence linking this phospholipid-bound nuclear receptor to hepatic lipid metabolism is lacking. Here, we report an essential role for LRH-1 in hepatic lipid storage and phospholipid composition based on an acute hepatic KO of LRH-1 in adult mice (LRH-1AAV8-Cre mice). Indeed, LRH-1-deficient hepatocytes exhibited large cytosolic lipid droplets and increased triglycerides (TGs). LRH-1-deficient mice fed high-fat diet displayed macrovesicular steatosis, liver injury, and glucose intolerance, all of which were reversed or improved by expressing wild-type human LRH-1. While hepatic lipid synthesis decreased and lipid export remained unchanged in mutants, elevated circulating free fatty acid helped explain the lipid imbalance in LRH-1AAV8-Cre mice. Lipidomic and genomic analyses revealed that loss of LRH-1 disrupts hepatic phospholipid composition, leading to lowered arachidonoyl (AA) phospholipids due to repression of Elovl5 and Fads2, two critical genes in AA biosynthesis. Our findings reveal a role for the phospholipid sensor LRH-1 in maintaining adequate pools of hepatic AA phospholipids, further supporting the idea that phospholipid diversity is an important contributor to healthy hepatic lipid storage.
The present study was to investigate clinical significance, biological functions and underlying mechanisms of BTB Domain and CNC Homolog 1(BACH1) deregulation in human colorectal cancer (CRC). The result showed that BACH1 upregulation was significantly associated with enhanced tumor invasion (P = 0.014) and gender (P = 0.028) of CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier method results showed that the overall survival of CRC patients with high BACH1 mRNA expression was markedly shorter than those with low expression (P = 0.015), and multivariate analyzes results showed that BACH1 was an independent prognostic predictor for CRC patients (P = 0.049). In vitro studies revealed that BACH1 efficiently promoted invasion and migration of CRC cell line. In vitro studies proved that the HCT116 cell stably expressing BACH1 formed significantly larger tumor nodules and remarkably accelerated tumor xenografts growth. In addition, Immunohistochemical scores of CD31 and Vimentin were significantly higher than those of the control group. Finally, correlation analysis indicated that BACH1 expression was positively correlated with C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4(CXCR4) in tumor tissues and cell lines. Together, BACH1 serves as an oncogene to promote CRC progression and an independent prognostic factor for survival and metastasis. BACH1 may inhibit the progression of CRC through BACH1/CXCR4 pathway.
Targeting of steroidogenic enzymes (e.g., abiraterone acetate targeting CYP17A1) has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, resistance to steroidal inhibitors inevitably develops in patients, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is a nuclear receptor, originally characterized as an important regulator of some liver-specific metabolic genes. Here, we report that LRH-1, which exhibited an increased expression pattern in high-grade prostate cancer and CRPC xenograft models, functions to promote de novo androgen biosynthesis via its direct transactivation of several key steroidogenic enzyme genes, elevating intratumoral androgen levels and reactivating AR signaling in CRPC xenografts as well as abiraterone-treated CRPC tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of LRH-1 activity attenuated LRH-1-mediated androgen deprivation and anti-androgen resistance of prostate cancer cells. Our findings not only demonstrate the significant role of LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis, but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.Significance: These findings not only demonstrate the significant role of the nuclear receptor LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis, but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.

In order to identify the potential pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developing from cirrhosis, a microarray‑based transcriptome profile was analyzed. The GSE63898 expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included data from 228 HCC tissue samples and 168 cirrhotic tissue samples. The Robust Multi‑array Average in the Affy package of R was used for raw data processing and Student's t‑test was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). An enrichment analysis was then conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery online tool, and the protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes and Cytoscape. Furthermore, the MCODE plug‑in of Cytoscape was used to conduct a sub‑module analysis. A total of 634 DEGs were identified between HCC and cirrhosis, of which 165 were upregulated and 469 were downregulated. According to the cut‑off criteria, the PPI network was constructed and Jun proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (degree, 39), Fos proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit (degree, 34) and v‑myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (degree, 32) were identified as the hub nodes of the PPI network. Based on the sub‑module analysis, four specific modules were identified. In particular, module 1 was significantly enriched in the chemokine signaling pathway, and C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12, C‑C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and C‑C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) were three important proteins in this module. Module 4 was significantly enriched in chemical carcinogenesis, and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1, cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily A member 6 (CYP2A6) were three important proteins in this module. In conclusion, the present study revealed that CCR7, CCL5, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6 are novel genes identified in the development of HCC; however, the actual functions of these genes require verification.
In mouse ovaries, liver receptor homolog-1 [nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (Nr5a2)] expression is restricted to granulosa cells. Mice with Nr5a2 depletion in this cell population fail to ovulate. To determine whether Nr5a2 is essential for granulosa cell proliferation during follicular maturation, we generated granulosa-specific conditional knockout mice (genotype Nr5a2 floxed Cre-recombinase driven by the anti-Müllerian type II receptor, hereafter cKO) with Nr5a2 depletion from primary follicles forward. Proliferation in cKO granulosa cells was substantially reduced relative to control (CON) counterparts, as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, proliferative cell nuclear antigen expression, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Microarray analysis revealed &gt;2000 differentially regulated transcripts between cKO and CON granulosa cells. Major gene ontology pathways disrupted were proliferation, steroid biosynthesis, female gamete formation, and ovulatory cycle. Transcripts for key cell-cycle genes, including Ccnd1, Ccnd2, Ccne1, Ccne2, E2f1, and E2f2, were in reduced abundance. Transcripts from other cell-cycle-related factors, including Cdh2, Plagl1, Cdkn1a, Prkar2b, Gstm1, Cdk7, and Pts, were overexpressed. Although the follicle-stimulating hormone and estrogen receptors were overexpressed in the cKO animals, in vivo treatment with estradiol-17β failed to rescue decreased proliferation. In vitro inactivation of Nr5a2 using the ML180 reverse agonist similarly decreased cell-cycle-related gene transcripts and downstream targets, as in cKO mice. Pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin, an Nr5a2 cofactor, decreased cyclin gene transcripts and downstream targets. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction of pro/antiapoptotic and autophagic markers showed no differences between cKO and CON granulosa cells. Thus, Nr5a2 is essential for granulosa cell proliferation, but its depletion does not alter the frequency of apoptosis nor autophagy.
miR-1275 is one of the microRNAs (miRNAs) that are differentially expressed during follicular atresia in pig ovaries, as identified by a miRNA microarray assay in our previous study [1]. However, its functions in follicular atresia remain unknown. In this study, we showed that miR-1275 promotes early apoptosis of porcine granulosa cells (pGCs) and the initiation of follicular atresia, and inhibits E2 release and expression of CYP19A1, the key gene in E2 production. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays revealed that liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1, not CYP19A1, is a direct functional target of miR-1275. In vitro overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that LRH-1 significantly repressed apoptosis and induced E2 secretion and CYP19A1 expression in pGCs. LRH-1, whose expression was regulated by miR-1275, prevented apoptosis in pGCs. Furthermore, luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that LRH-1 protein bound to the CYP19A1 promoter and increased its activity. Our findings suggest that miR-1275 attenuates LRH-1 expression by directly binding to its 3'UTR. This prevents the interaction of LRH-1 protein with the CYP19A1 promoter, represses E2 synthesis, promotes pGC apoptosis, and initiates follicular atresia in porcine ovaries.
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most type of common pediatric liver cancer. The primary chemotherapy drug for HB is cisplatin (DDP). However, patients readily develop intrinsic and acquired resistance, and severe side effects to treatment. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) is a key enzyme involved in the generation of sphingomyelin (SM), which is able to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The death receptors (DRs) have important functions in DDP-induced apoptosis. However, whether SMS2 is able to modulate cell apoptosis through the DR signaling pathway remains unknown. To investigate this question, SMS2 was overexpressed in HepG2 cells and treated with 3.5 mg/l cisplatin in the present study. After 24 h, the expression of SMS2, avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc), DR4, DR5 and caspase-3 was analyzed. Furthermore, cell viability was quantified, and apoptosis was assessed by western blot and flow cytometry analysis as well as Cell Counting kit-8. The results of the present study revealed that overexpression of SMS2 was able to increase the expression of c-Myc, cleaved caspase-3, DR4 and DR5 compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05, n=3), and increase the levels of apoptosis in the SMS2 + DDP group, compared with the control (P&lt;0.001, n=3). These results indicate that overexpression of SMS2 is able to improve sensitivity of HepG2 cells to DDP by increasing the expression of c-Myc, DR4 and DR5 in HepG2 cells. This increased sensitivity may decrease intrinsic and acquired resistance of chemotherapy in HB, and reduce the associated severe side effects in pediatric patients.
As a member of miR-17-92 miRNA clusters, miR‑19a has been considered to regulate hepatic glycogenesis by mediating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. However, whether miR‑19a serves an important role in gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes remains unknown. In the present study, the impact of miR‑19a on gluconeogenesis in HEP1‑6 cells and its mechanisms of action were investigated. It was observed that overexpression of miR‑19a led to decreased glucose production, accompanied by increased activation of the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway and downregulated expression of gluconeogenesis‑associated genes, including peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6‑phosphatase in the HEP1‑6 cells transfected with the miR‑19a mimic. In contrast, suppression of miR‑19a impaired the activation of the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway and increased the expression of gluconeogenesis‑associated genes, accompanied by an elevated glucose production. Additionally, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was identified as a target of miR‑19a and participated in the miR‑19a‑mediated gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of miR‑19a on the regulation of the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway and the expression of gluconeogenesis‑associated genes. MiR‑19a may mediate gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes by downregulating PTEN expression.
Pressure overload causes cardiac fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation, leading to increased interstitial fibrosis formation and subsequently myocardial stiffness, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and eventually heart failure. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling and fibrosis will have implications for heart failure treatment strategies. The microRNA (miRNA)-221/222 family, consisting of miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p, is differentially regulated in mouse and human cardiac pathology and inversely associated with kidney and liver fibrosis. We investigated the role of this miRNA family during pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling. In myocardial biopsies of patients with severe fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy or aortic stenosis, we found significantly lower miRNA-221/222 levels as compared to matched patients with nonsevere fibrosis. In addition, miRNA-221/222 levels in aortic stenosis patients correlated negatively with the extent of myocardial fibrosis and with left ventricular stiffness. Inhibition of both miRNAs during AngII (angiotensin II)-mediated pressure overload in mice led to increased fibrosis and aggravated left ventricular dilation and dysfunction. In rat cardiac fibroblasts, inhibition of miRNA-221/222 derepressed TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β)-mediated profibrotic SMAD2 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2) signaling and downstream gene expression, whereas overexpression of both miRNAs blunted TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling. We found that the miRNA-221/222 family may target several genes involved in TGF-β signaling, including JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1), TGF-β receptor 1 and TGF-β receptor 2, and ETS-1 (ETS proto-oncogene 1). Our findings show that heart failure-associated downregulation of the miRNA-221/222 family enables profibrotic signaling in the pressure-overloaded heart.
There is no previous study in the literature that has examined the relationship between circulating vitamin K1 (VK1) with glycemic status in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, scientific explanation for the beneficial role of VK1 supplementation in lowering glycemia in diabetes is yet to be determined. This study for the first time demonstrated that circulating VK1 was significantly lower in T2D patients compared to age-matched control subjects, and VK1 levels in T2D were significantly and inversely associated with fasting glucose and insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], which suggest that boosting plasma VK1 may reduce the fasting glucose and insulin resistance in T2D patients. Using high-fat-diet-fed T2D animal model, this study further investigated the positive effect of VK1 supplementation on glucose metabolism and examined the underlying molecular mechanism. Results showed that VK1 supplementation [1, 3, 5 μg/kg body weight (BW), 8 weeks] dose dependently improved the glucose tolerance; decreased BW gain, fasting glucose and insulin, glycated hemoglobin, HOMA-IR and cytokine secretion (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6); and regulated the signaling pathway of hepatic glucose metabolism [sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog/glucose transporter 2/glucokinase/glucose 6 phosphatase], lipid oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha/carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) and inflammation (nuclear factor kappa B) in T2D mice. Comparative signal silencing studies also depicted the role of SIRT1/AMPK in mediating the effect of VK1 on glucose metabolism, lipid oxidation and inflammation in high-glucose-treated cultured hepatocytes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that circulating VK1 has a positive effect on lowering fasting glucose and insulin resistance in T2D via regulating SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway.
Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) has been suggested as a critical event in colon cancer development and progression. Recent studies have suggested that miR-374b is a novel cancer-related miRNA involved in several cancer types. Thus far, very little is known about the role of miR-374b in colon cancer; therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential role of miR-374b in colon cancer. Here, we showed that miR-374b expression was significantly downregulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-374b inhibited the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells, while miR-374b suppression promoted colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was identified as a target of miR-374b in colon cancer cells. Both the mRNA and protein expression of LRH-1 were regulated by miR-374b. In addition, an inverse correlation between LRH-1 mRNA and miR-374b expression was evidenced in colon cancer specimens. Notably, overexpression of miR-374b also downregulated the Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, restoration of LRH-1 expression significantly abolished the antitumor effect of miR-374b in colon cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR-374b inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of LRH-1 expression. Inhibiting LRH-1 by miR-374b may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.
Liver dual arterial blood supply (LDABS) could increase blood supply to the liver and maintain normal liver regeneration in patients with compromised portal vein. The current study attempted to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male Sprague‑Dawley rats randomly received partial hepatectomy (PH) alone or PH followed by LDABS. Liver regeneration was assessed by histological examination, liver function and liver regeneration rate (LRR). Whole‑genome oligo microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression profile between rats receiving PH and rats receiving PH plus LDABS. Key genes identification was validated using a MAPK signaling polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. The extent of liver regeneration in rats receiving PH plus LDABS was comparable to that in rats receiving PH alone. The differentially expressed genes were enriched in 12 signaling pathways in two groups. MAPK signaling pathway, NF‑kappa B signaling pathway, and Toll‑like receptor signaling pathway were involved in LDABS‑mediated liver regeneration, with Retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1), Cyclin D1, Cyclin‑dependent kinase 4, Mitogen‑activated protein kinase 10 (Mapk10) and CAMP responsive element binding protein 1 genes in the initiation phase, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kras), tumor protein 53, MYC proto‑oncogene, BHLH transcription factor, Cyclin E1 and Heat shock protein family B (small) member 1 genes in the proliferation phase, Kras, Rb1, Jun proto‑oncogene, AP‑1 transcription factor subunit, Cyclin D2 and Mapk10 genes in the termination phase were identified as key genes in LDABS‑mediated liver regeneration using MAPK signaling PCR array analysis.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the dominant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV X protein (HBx) plays crucial roles in HCC carcinogenesis. HBx interferes with several signaling pathways including the Notch1 pathway in HCC. In this study, we found that Notch1 was highly expressed in HCC, especially in large HCCs. Notch1 and HBx co-localized in HCC and their levels were positively correlated with each other. Notch1 expression was more elevated in HepG2.2.15 cells than that in HepG2 cells. HBx activated the Notch1 pathway in HepG2.2.15 cells. Suppression of HBx and the Notch1 pathway attenuated the growth of HepG2.2.15 cells. Notch1, ERK, and AKT pathways were inhibited after γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. Dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were upregulated after γ-secretase inhibitor treatment and Hes1 inhibition. Luciferase reporter assays showed that Hes1 suppressed the promoters of DUSP1 and PTEN genes, which was reversed by γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. Western blotting demonstrated that DUSP1 dephosphorylated pERK and PTEN dephosphorylated pAKT. Collectively, we found a link among HBx, the Notch1 pathway, DUSP1/PTEN, and ERK/AKT pathways, which influenced HCC cell survival and could be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
Notch signaling plays an emerging role in the regulation of immune cell development and function during inflammatory response. Activation of the ras homolog gene family member A/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway promotes leukocyte accumulation in tissue injury. However, it remains unknown whether Notch signaling regulates ras homolog gene family member A/ROCK-mediated immune responses in liver ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. This study investigated intracellular signaling pathways regulated by Notch receptors in the IR-stressed liver and in vitro. In a mouse model of IR-induced liver inflammatory injury, we found that mice with myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout showed aggravated hepatocellular damage, with increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatocellular apoptosis, macrophage/neutrophil trafficking, and proinflammatory mediators compared to Notch1-proficient controls. Unlike in the controls, myeloid Notch1 ablation diminished hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) and augmented c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1), JNK, ROCK1, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activation in ischemic livers. Disruption of JSAP1 in myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout livers improved hepatocellular function and reduced JNK, ROCK1, PTEN, and toll-like receptor 4 activation. Moreover, ROCK1 knockdown inhibited PTEN and promoted Akt, leading to depressed toll-like receptor 4. In parallel in vitro studies, transfection of lentivirus-expressing Notch1 intracellular domain promoted Hes1 and inhibited JSAP1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. Hes1 deletion enhanced JSAP1/JNK activation, whereas clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9-mediated JSAP1 knockout diminished ROCK1/PTEN and toll-like receptor 4 signaling.
Myeloid Notch1 deficiency activates the ras homolog gene family member A/ROCK pathway and exacerbates hepatocellular injury by inhibiting transcriptional repressor Hes1 and inducing scaffold protein JSAP1 in IR-triggered liver inflammation; our findings underscore the crucial role of the Notch-Hes1 axis as a novel regulator of innate immunity-mediated inflammation and imply the therapeutic potential for the management of organ IR injury in transplant recipients. (Hepatology 2018;67:1041-1055).
This study is to investigate the methylation status of multiple tumor suppressor 1 (p16), secreted glycoprotein 2 (SLIT2), scavenger receptor class A, member 5 putative (SCARA5), and human runt-related transcription factor 3 (Runx3) genes in the peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This is a case-control study. The peripheral blood samples were collected from 25 HCC patients, 25 patients with high risk of HCC (defined as "internal control group"), and 25 healthy individuals (defined as "external control group"), respectively. Then the methylation status of p16, SLIT2, SCARA5, and Runx3 genes in the blood samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing. The relationship between the methylation and the clinical features of HCC patients were evaluated.The methylation levels in the 7 CpG loci of p16 gene in HCC patients were low and without statistically significant difference (P &gt; .05) compared to the control groups. Although the methylation levels of CpG3 and CpG4 in SLIT2 gene loci were higher than those of the control groups, there was no statistically significant difference (P &gt; .05). However, the methylation rate of CpG2 locus in SCARA5 gene in HCC patients was significantly higher (P &lt; .05). And the methylation rates of CpG1, CpG2, CpG3, CpG4, CpG5, and CpG8 in Runx3 gene in HCC patients were significantly different to that of control groups (P &lt; .05). We also have analyzed the correlations between the CpG islands methylation of Runx3 or SCARA5 genes and the age, gender, hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, alpha fetal protein, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of the HCC patients, which all showed no significant correlations (P &gt; .05).The methylation status of SCARA5 and Runx3 genes are abnormal in HCC patients, which may further be used as molecular markers for early auxiliary diagnosis of liver cancer.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major source of fibrogenesis in the liver, contributing to cirrhosis. When activated, HSCs transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts and undergo profound functional alterations paralleling an overhaul of the transcriptome, the mechanism of which remains largely undefined. We investigated the involvement of the class III deacetylase sirtuin [silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)] in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. SIRT1 levels were down-regulated in the livers in mouse models of liver fibrosis, in patients with cirrhosis, and in activated HSCs as opposed to quiescent HSCs. SIRT1 activation halted, whereas SIRT1 inhibition promoted, HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Liver fibrosis was exacerbated in mice with HSC-specific deletion of SIRT1 [conditional knockout (cKO)], receiving CCl4 (1 mg/kg) injection or subjected to bile duct ligation, compared to wild-type littermates. SIRT1 regulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcription by deacetylating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in quiescent HSCs. Finally, EZH2 inhibition or PPARγ activation ameliorated fibrogenesis in cKO mice. In summary, our data suggest that SIRT1 plays an essential role guiding the transition of HSC phenotypes.-Li, M., Hong, W., Hao, C., Li, L., Wu, D., Shen, A., Lu, J., Zheng, Y., Li, P., Xu, Y. SIRT1 antagonizes liver fibrosis by blocking hepatic stellate cell activation in mice.
Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) is a complex and well-elaborated biological process whereby synchronized cell proliferation is induced in response to the loss of liver mass. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, which plays a crucial role in normal growth and development, is involved in the process of liver regeneration. To assess the changes in the levels of serum IGF1 and hepatic IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), we established a mouse model for PH. This also allowed us to further explore the mechanisms that participate in the regulation of liver regeneration. Serum IGF1 dramatically decreased immediately after PH, and was mildly elevated afterwards. This was also confirmed in patients who had undergone PH. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that hepatic IGF1R expression was elevated after surgery in mice. Hepatosomatic index showed a mild elevation 1 week after surgery and a marked elevation after 3 weeks. Western blotting showed increased levels of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), but the phosphorylated forms of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) and FOXO3 were all downregulated. Our data show that the GSK3B-FOXO3 pathway is activated after PH, and this may be one of the mechanisms that lead to upregulation of hepatic IGF1R after PH. All these changes after surgery promote liver regeneration.
Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinical challenge as no curative therapeutic is available. In this context, a better understanding of metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa is an important issue. As phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is the most common genetic lesion in such cancer, we investigate human data sets for mechanisms that can constrain cancer evolution in this setting. Here we report a liver X receptor (LXR) signature, which tightly correlates with PTEN loss, in PCa. Accordingly, the LXR pathway is deregulated in prostate carcinomas in Pten-null mice. Genetic ablation of LXRs in Pten-null mice, exacerbates PCa invasiveness and metastatic dissemination, which involves mesenchymal transition and accumulation of matrix metalloproteinases. Mechanistically, PTEN deletion governed LXR transcriptional activity through deregulation of cholesterol de novo synthesis, resulting in accumulation of endogenous LXR ligands. Our study therefore reveals a functional circuit linking PTEN and LXR, and highlights LXRs as metabolic gatekeepers that are able to constrain PCa progression.Treatment of prostate cancer, especially in its advanced stage, is still challenging; therefore, strategies to prevent metastatic dissemination are of great interest. Here the authors reveal a crucial role for liver X receptors in suppressing prostate carcinogenesis and metastatic progression in PTEN-null tumors.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant transformation of biliary epithelial cells. It is a slow growing tumor, but is also highly metastatic with a poor prognosis. Bile acids are known to transactivate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cholangiocytes and induce cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The protein expression profiles of bile acid-treated CCA cells were studied using a proteomic approach. To elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in the bile acid-mediated enhancement of CCA cell migration, the effects of six bile acids, including cholic, deoxycholic, taurocholic, taurodeoxycholic, glycocholic and glycodeoxycholic acid, on the migration of CCA cells were examined in vitro using wound healing assays. Subsequently, the possible proteins involved in enhanced CCA cell migration were investigated using a proteomic approach. Changes to the protein expression profiles of CCA cells following bile acid treatment was examined using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The results demonstrated that cholic and deoxycholic acid significantly enhanced the migration of CCA cells, compared with the treated MMNK-1 control cells. CCA cells had 77 overexpressed protein spots following cholic acid treatment, and 50 protein spots following deoxycholic acid treatment, compared with the treated MMNK-1 control cells. Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that coiled-coil domain containing 25 (CCDC25) was significantly overexpressed in cholic acid-treated CCA cells compared with in cholic acid-treated control cells. When the expression levels of CCDC25 were investigated using western blot analysis, CCDC25 was demonstrated to be highly expressed in CCA tissues, but not in the adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples. The identified proteins were further analyzed for protein-chemical interactions using STITCH version 3.1 software. CCDC25 protein was identified to be associated with Son of sevenless homolog 1 and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, which are involved in EGFR signaling. The results of the present study demonstrated that following cholic acid treatment, CCDC25 is overexpressed in CCA cells, which is associated with significantly enhanced cell migration. This suggests that CCDC25 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with CCA.
Apoptosis is an important defense mechanism mounted by the immune system to control virus replication. Hence, cytomegaloviruses (CMV) evolved and acquired numerous anti-apoptotic genes. The product of the human CMV (HCMV) UL36 gene, pUL36 (also known as vICA), binds to pro-caspase-8, thus inhibiting death-receptor apoptosis and enabling viral replication in differentiated THP-1 cells. In vivo studies of the function of HCMV genes are severely limited due to the strict host specificity of cytomegaloviruses, but CMV orthologues that co-evolved with other species allow the experimental study of CMV biology in vivo. The mouse CMV (MCMV) homolog of the UL36 gene is called M36, and its protein product (pM36) is a functional homolog of vICA that binds to murine caspase-8 and inhibits its activation. M36-deficient MCMV is severely growth impaired in macrophages and in vivo. Here we show that pUL36 binds to the murine pro-caspase-8, and that UL36 expression inhibits death-receptor apoptosis in murine cells and can replace M36 to allow MCMV growth in vitro and in vivo. We generated a chimeric MCMV expressing the UL36 ORF sequence instead of the M36 one. The newly generated MCMVUL36 inhibited apoptosis in macrophage lines RAW 264.7, J774A.1, and IC-21 and its growth was rescued to wild type levels. Similarly, growth was rescued in vivo in the liver and spleen, but only partially in the salivary glands of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, we determined that an immune-evasive HCMV gene is conserved enough to functionally replace its MCMV counterpart and thus allow its study in an in vivo setting. As UL36 and M36 proteins engage the same molecular host target, our newly developed model can facilitate studies of anti-viral compounds targeting pUL36 in vivo.
An increasing number of studies have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the malignant behavior of colon cancer cells through directly targeting multiple tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The expression and role of miR-136 has been reported in several types of human cancer. However, the role of miR-136 in colon cancer remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and function of miR-136 in colon cancer and the potential underlying mechanism. Here, we found that miR-136 was decreased in colon cancer cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR-136 inhibited the proliferation and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines while suppression of miR-136 exhibited the opposite effect. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-136. Notably, miR-136 overexpression suppressed LRH-1 expression as well as Wnt signaling in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. The miR-136 expression level inversely correlated with LRH-1 mRNA expression in colon cancer specimens. Moreover, overexpression of LRH-1 partially reversed the miR-136-induced antitumor effect in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-136 functions as a negative regulator in colon cancer progression by targeting LRH-1 and that miR-136 downregulation contributes to high expression of LRH-1 and aberrant activation of Wnt signaling, leaving open the possibility that miR-136 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.
Dairy cows with fatty liver or ketosis display decreased insulin sensitivity and defects in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well-known tumor suppressor and also a negative regulator of insulin signaling and peripheral insulin sensitivity. We investigated the hypothesis that PTEN may affect the insulin pathway-mediated hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in dairy cows. Adenovirus vectors that over-express and silence PTEN were constructed, and then transfected into hepatocytes isolated from calves to investigate the effect of PTEN on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. PTEN silencing increased the phosphorylation of AKT and the expression of PI3K but decreased the phosphorylation of IRS1, which increased the phosphorylation levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Increased GSK-3β phosphorylation further up-regulated expression of the key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6-Pase) involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of SREBP-1c target gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) also increased significantly. We further showed that PTEN over-expression could reverse the above results. PTEN negatively regulates the enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, which suggests that PTEN may be a therapeutic target for ketosis and fatty liver in dairy cows.
Nuclear receptors are intracellular proteins that act as transcription factors. Proteins with classic nuclear receptor domain structure lacking identified signaling ligands are designated orphan nuclear receptors. Two of these, steroidogenic factor-1 (NR5A1, also known as SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (NR5A2, also known as LRH-1), bind to the same DNA sequences, with different and nonoverlapping effects on targets. Endogenous regulation of both is achieved predominantly by cofactor interactions. SF-1 is expressed primarily in steroidogenic tissues, LRH-1 in tissues of endodermal origin and the gonads. Both receptors modulate cholesterol homeostasis, steroidogenesis, tissue-specific cell proliferation, and stem cell pluripotency. LRH-1 is essential for development beyond gastrulation and SF-1 for genesis of the adrenal, sexual differentiation, and Leydig cell function. Ovary-specific depletion of SF-1 disrupts follicle development, while LRH-1 depletion prevents ovulation, cumulus expansion, and luteinization. Uterine depletion of LRH-1 compromises decidualization and pregnancy. In humans, SF-1 is present in endometriotic tissue, where it regulates estrogen synthesis. SF-1 is underexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and overexpressed in Leydig cell tumors. In breast cancer cells, proliferation, migration and invasion, and chemotherapy resistance are regulated by LRH-1. In conclusion, the NR5A orphan nuclear receptors are nonredundant factors that are crucial regulators of a panoply of biological processes, across multiple reproductive tissues.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are devastating chronic immunopathologies of the intestinal mucosa, which are frequently treated by immunosuppressive glucocorticoids. Endogenous glucocorticoids are not only produced by the adrenal glands, but also by the intestinal epithelium. Local glucocorticoid synthesis critically contributes to the immune homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa. As defective intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis has been associated with the development of IBD, we investigated the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and the key transcriptional regulator Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2) in ileal and colonic biopsies human pediatric IBD and control patients. Furthermore, the induction of steroidogenic enzymes and their transcriptional regulation by LRH-1 was investigated in a mouse model of experimental colitis. These analyses revealed that colitis-induced expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the murine colon is dependent on the presence of LRH-1, as intestinal deletion of LRH-1 strongly reduced their colitis-induced expression. Similarly, a strong correlation between the expression of LRH-1 and different steroidogenic enzymes was seen in intestinal biopsies of human pediatric patients. Importantly, reduced expression of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11B1 (HSD11B1) was observed in IBD patients compared to control patients, suggesting that defective local reactivation of glucocorticoids could contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.
Olfactory receptors are primarily expressed in nasal olfactory epithelium, but these receptors are also ectopically expressed in diverse tissues. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of Olfr43, a mouse homolog of human OR1A1, in cultured hepatocytes and mice to assess its functionality in lipid metabolism. Olfr43 was expressed in mouse hepatocytes, and Olfr43 activation by a known ligand, (-)-carvone, stimulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity. In ligand-receptor binding studies using site-directed mutagenesis, (-)-carvone binding required two residues, M257 and Y258, in Olfr43. In the mouse study, oral administration of (-)-carvone for 5 weeks in high-fat diet-fed mice improved energy metabolism, including reductions in hepatic steatosis and adiposity, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance. In mouse livers and cultured mouse hepatocytes, Olfr43 activation simulated the CREB-hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ signaling axis, leading to a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mouse liver. Thus, long-term administration of (-)-carvone reduces hepatic steatosis. The knockdown of Olfr43 gene expression in cultured hepatocytes negated these effects of (-)-carvone. In conclusion, an ectopic olfactory receptor, hepatic Olfr43, regulates energy metabolism via the CREB-HES1-PPARγ signaling axis.
Hepatic ischemia reperfusion (HIR) has been found to induce hippocampus injury and cognitive dysfunction. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) is an important factor mediating excitotoxicity and neurons injury, and autophosphorylation of Src can up-regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A to improve its activity. However, the role of Src and NR2A in HIR-induced hippocampus injury in young mice remains unknown. In this study, we found that serum biomarkers of brain injury (S100β and NSE) increased significantly and reached highest after reperfusion of 3 days which had the same trend with the levels of p-Src and p-NR2A. Interactions between Src and NR2A or PSD95 were increased after HIR. Hippocampal neuron apoptosis was increased, and long-term cognitive impairment was found after reperfusion of 1 month. Inhibition of Src and NR2A with PP2 and NVP-AAM077 respectively not only down-regulated the levels of p-Src and p-NR2A, but also ameliorated hippocampal neurons apoptosis and long-term cognitive impairment after HIR. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-6 were increased after reperfusion of 3 days, while PP2 and NVP-AAM077 treatment didn't attenuate the changes. And no difference was found in serum TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6 concentrations as well as the levels of Src, p-Src, NR2A, p-NR2A, PSD95 among the four groups after reperfusion of 1 month. In summary, HIR can lead to hippocampus injury and long-term cognitive dysfunction, and Src-PSD95-NR2A pathway plays an important role in the process.
Phosphoinositide membrane signaling is critical for normal physiology, playing well-known roles in diverse human pathologies. The basic mechanisms governing phosphoinositide signaling within the nucleus, however, have remained deeply enigmatic owing to their presence outside the nuclear membranes. Over 40% of nuclear phosphoinositides can exist in this non-membrane state, held soluble in the nucleoplasm by nuclear proteins that remain largely unidentified. Recently, two nuclear proteins responsible for solubilizing phosphoinositides were identified, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2), along with two enzymes that directly remodel these phosphoinositide/protein complexes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; MMAC) and inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK; ipk2). These new footholds now permit the assignment of physiological functions for nuclear phosphoinositides in human diseases, such as endometriosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The unique nature of nuclear phosphoinositide signaling affords extraordinary clinical opportunities for new biomarkers, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Thus, phosphoinositide biology within the nucleus may represent the next generation of low-hanging fruit for new drugs, not unlike what has occurred for membrane phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase drug development. This review connects recent basic science discoveries in nuclear phosphoinositide signaling to clinical pathologies, with the hope of inspiring development of new therapies.
To explore the action mechanisms of Huangqi Decoction Granules (, HQDG) on hepatitis B cirrhosis.
A total of 85 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis were randomly divided into HQDG group (42 cases) and control group (43 cases) by a random number table and were treated with HQDG or placebo for 48 weeks (6 g per times and orally for 3 times a day), respectively. After RNA-sequencing of serum samples extracted from the patients, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HQDG and control groups before and after treatment were separately screened. The DEGs were then performed pathway enrichment analysis and proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The expression levels of key genes were detected by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
After the investigation, 4 and 3 cases were respectively excluded from HQD and control groups because of the incomplete data. Additionally, 3 and 5 cases were lost to follow up in HQD and control groups respectively. Finally, a total of 70 cases with good compliance were included for further DEGs analysis. A total of 1,070 DEGs (including 455 up-regulated genes and 615 down-regulated genes) in HQDG group and 227 DEGs (including 164 up-regulated genes and 63 down-regulated genes) in the control group were identified after treatment. Compared with the control group, 1,043 DEGs were specific in HQDG group. Besides, 1 up-regulated transcription factor (TF, such as GLI family zinc finger 1, GLI1) and 25 down-regulated TFs (such as drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic proteinfamily member 2, SMAD2) were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that down-regulated Ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA) was enriched in pathogenic Escherichia coli infection. In the PPI network, up-regulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and down-regulated cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) as well as v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) had higher degrees. Moreover, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) was involved in the lncRNA-target regulatory network. Furthermore, qRT-PCR revealed that expression levels of CDC42 and GLI1 had significant differences in HQDG group before and after treatment (P&lt;0.05).
CDC42 and GLI1 may be the targets of HQDG in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis. Additionally, SMAD2, EGFR, AKT1, RHOA and GAS5 might be associated with the curative effect of HQDG on hepatitis B cirrhosis patients.
Pinocembrin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (PCBG), pinocembrin (PCB), and 5-methoxy-pinocembrin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (MPG) are three flavonones isolated from Penthorum chinense Pursh (P. chinense). The effects of the three flavonones on hepatic steatosis and their molecular mechanisms in HepG2 cells were investigated in this study for the first time. A model of hepatic steatosis in HepG2 cells was induced by free fatty acid (FFA), and co-treated with the three flavonones as mentioned. Intracellular lipid droplets were detected by Oil Red O staining. PCB, PCBG, and MPG suppressed oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were ameliorated. Moreover, these flavonones enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the expression of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and reduced the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and the downstream targets fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Molecular docking was used to predict the interaction and combination patterns between the three flavonones and the enzymes above. The results revealed that the SIRT1/AMPK pathway is involved in the functions of the three flavonones, and the most effective flavonone against hepatic steatosis might be PCBG, followed by MPG and PCB. Therefore, the three flavonones from P. chinense were found to exert preventive effects against hepatic steatosis by regulating the SIRT1/AMPK pathway.
Emerging evidence indicates that G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), a nonclassic receptor of the endocannabinoid system that is activated by L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol and various cannabinoid ligands, may regulate endocrine function and energy metabolism. We examined how GPR55 deficiency and modulation affects insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver alongside expression analysis of proteins implicated in insulin action and energy metabolism. We show that GPR55-null mice display decreased insulin sensitivity in these tissues, as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its downstream targets, concomitant with increased adiposity and reduced physical activity relative to wild-type counterparts. Impaired tissue insulin sensitivity coincided with reduced insulin receptor substrate-1 abundance in skeletal muscle, whereas in liver and epididymal fat it was associated with increased expression of the 3-phosphoinoistide lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog. In contrast, GPR55 activation enhanced insulin signaling in cultured skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, and hepatocytes; this response was negated by receptor antagonists and GPR55 gene silencing in L6 myotubes. Sustained GPR55 antagonism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes enhanced expression of proteins implicated in lipogenesis and promoted triglyceride accumulation. Our findings identify GPR55 as a positive regulator of insulin action and adipogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target for countering obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance.-Lipina, C., Walsh, S. K., Mitchell, S. E., Speakman, J. R., Wainwright, C. L., Hundal, H. S. GPR55 deficiency is associated with increased adiposity and impaired insulin signaling in peripheral metabolic tissues.
To explore potential therapeutic target is one of the areas of great interest in both clinical and basic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) studies. Nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is proved to play a positive role in several cancers including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and intestinal cancer in recent years. However, the exact role of LRH-1 in the development and progression of HCC is not fully elucidated.
The LRH-1 expression level in HCC clinical samples was examined by immunohis-tochemistry (IHC). Stable LRH-1-suppressed HepG2 clones (HepG2LRH-1/-) were generated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted.
We confirmed that LRH-1 showed an increased expression pattern in HCC clinical samples. Our in vitro and in vivo results indicated that suppression of LRH-1 in HepG2 significantly attenuated its proliferation rate and tumorigenic capacity. Gene expression microarray analysis indicated that LRH-1mostly regulated gene expression involved in cell cycle. In addition, our gain-of-function experiments indicated that ectopic expression of LRH-1 dramatically induced the mRNA and protein levels of c-myc and cyclin E1, while attenuating the expression of p21.
Our results suggest that LRH-1 might be a potential therapeutic target for clinical HCC treatment.
Understanding the heterogeneity of dysregulated pathways associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may provide prognostic and therapeutic avenues for disease management. As HCC involves a complex process of genetic and epigenetic modifications, we evaluated expression of both polyadenylated transcripts and microRNAs from HCC and liver samples derived from two cohorts of patients undergoing either partial hepatic resection or liver transplantation. Copy number variants were inferred from whole genome low-pass sequencing data, and a set of 56 cancer-related genes were screened using an oncology panel assay. HCC was associated with marked transcriptional deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes. In the partially resected livers, diminished transcriptional activity was observed in genes associated with drug catabolism and increased expression in genes related to inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Moreover, several long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs not previously linked with HCC were found to be deregulated. In liver transplant recipients, down-regulation of genes involved in energy production and up-regulation of genes associated with glycolysis were detected. Numerous copy number variants events were observed, with hotspots on chromosomes 1 and 17. Amplifications were more common than deletions and spanned regions containing genes potentially involved in tumorigenesis. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 (NPM1), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide (PDGFRA), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), G-protein-coupled receptors-like receptor Smoothened (SMO), and tumor protein P53 (TP53) were mutated in all tumors; another 26 cancer-related genes were mutated with variable penetrance. Conclusion: Our results underscore the marked molecular heterogeneity between HCC tumors and reinforce the notion that precision medicine approaches are needed for management of individual HCC. These data will serve as a resource to generate hypotheses for further research to improve our understanding of HCC biology. (Hepatology Communications 2018; 00:000-000).
The present study aimed to identify the molecular basis of the arthrogryposis‑renal dysfunction‑cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the vacuolar protein sorting 33 homolog B (VPS33B) gene. The microarray dataset GSE83192, which contained six liver tissue samples from VPS33B knockout mice and four liver tissue samples from control mice, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the Limma package in R software. The DEGs most relevant to ARC were selected via weighted gene co‑expression network analysis to construct a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network. In addition, module analysis was performed for the PPI network using the Molecular Complex Detection function. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were also performed for DEGs in the PPI network. Potential drugs for ARC treatment were predicted using the Connectivity Map database. In total, 768 upregulated and 379 downregulated DEGs were detected in the VPS33B knockout mice, while three modules were identified from the PPI network constructed. The DEGs in module 1 (CD83, IL1B and TLR2) were mainly involved in the positive regulation of cytokine production and the Toll‑like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. The DEGs in module 2 (COL1A1 and COL1A2) were significantly enriched with respect to cellular component organization, extracellular matrix‑receptor interactions and focal adhesion. The DEGs in module 3 (ABCG8 and ABCG3) were clearly associated with sterol absorption and transport. Furthermore, mercaptopurine was identified to be a potential drug (connectivity score=‑0.939) for ARC treatment. In conclusion, the results of the current study may help to further understand the pathology of ARC, and the DEGs identified in these modules may serve as therapeutic targets.
Kawasaki disease (KD) is a type of acute febrile vasculitis syndrome and is the most frequent cause of cardiac illness in children under the age of five years old. Although the etiology of KD remains largely unknown, some recent genome-wide studies have indicated that epigenetic factors may be important in its pathogenesis. We enrolled 24 KD patients and 24 non-KD controls in this study to access their DNA methylation status using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Another 34 KD patients and 62 control subjects were enrolled for expression validation. Of the 3193 CpG methylation regions with a methylation difference ≥ 20% between KD and controls, 3096 CpG loci revealed hypomehtylation, with only 3% being hypermethylated. Pathway buildup identified 11 networked genes among the hypermethylated regions, including four transcription factors: nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1, v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1, runt related transcription factor 3, and retinoic acid receptor gamma, as well as the activator β-catenin. Ten of these network-selected genes demonstrated a significant decrease in mRNA in KD patients, whereas only CTNNB1 significantly decreased in correlation with coronary artery lesions in KD patients. Furthermore, CTNNB1-silenced THP-1 monocytic cells drastically increased the expression of CD40 and significantly increased the expression of both CD40 and CD40L in cocultured human coronary artery endothelial cells. This study is the first to identify network-based susceptible genes of hypermethylated CpG loci, their expression levels, and the functional impact of β-catenin, which may be involved in both the cause and the development of KD.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that are vital for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLR5 is responsible for the recognition of bacterial flagellin to induce the NF-κB activation and innate immune responses. In this study, we cloned and identified the TLR5 gene from the King pigeon (Columba livia) designated as PiTLR5. Full-length PiTLR5 cDNA (2583 bp) encoded an 860-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide sequence, 10 leucine-rich repeat domains, a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain. Pigeon TLR5 mRNA expression was quantified by performing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which showed that PiTLR5 was broadly expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and spleen. PiTLR5-mediated innate immune responses were measured by determining its effects on NF-κB activation and cytokine expression. The results showed that HEK293T cells transfected with PiTLR5 robustly activated the NF-κB response to flagellin, but not other TLR stimuli, and induced significant upregulation of IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, indicating that PiTLR5 is a functional TLR5 homolog. Additionally, following flagellin stimulation of pigeon splenic lymphocytes, the levels of TLR5, NF-κB, IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, and IFN-γ mRNA, assessed using qRT-PCR, were significantly upregulated. Besides, TLR5 knockdown resulted in the significantly downregulated expression of NF-κB and related cytokines/chemokines. Triggering pigeon TLR5 contributes to significant upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, suggesting that pigeon TLR5 plays an important role in the innate immune responses.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype F1b infection is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young Alaskan Native (AN) people. However, the mechanisms by which genotype F1b causes HCC are unclear. Here, we analyzed the clinical and virological significance of genotype F1b in long-term serial samples from 20 HCC patients with HBV infection. Complete sequence analyses revealed that all isolates were genotype F1b. In the HCC patients, T1938C and A2051C mutations in the core region had accumulated significantly with A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) region and G1896A mutation in the precore (PC) region. Several HBV clones containing the core mutations were examined for their replication efficiency and core stability in vitro. Clones containing the A2051C mutation replicated more efficiently than the wild type in association with enhanced stability of core protein dimerization. In chimeric mice with human hepatocytes carrying BCP/PC/2051 mutant but not with wild-type virus, liver fibrosis was induced in association with high levels of serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen. Interestingly, microarray analysis and validation study showed that five genes associated with cell proliferation or carcinogenesis, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog, Grb2-associated binding protein 2, bradykinin receptor B2, follistatin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, were significantly up-regulated in human hepatocytes infected with genotype F1b, particularly the BCP/PC/2051 mutant, compared with other genotypes. Conclusion: We have identified an association between Alaska-specific core mutations and HCC development in AN people infected with genotype F1b; accumulation of these core mutations during the course of chronic infection with genotype F1b would contribute to HCC development in AN people earlier in life.
Defects in mucus and intestinal epithelia can lead to intestinal inflammation in colitis. Reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the mucosa may contribute to inflammation. However, the roles of PPARγ in the intestinal barrier remain poorly understood.
Chronic colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 27 days. Three days before DSS treatment, mice were treated with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Ro) orally at 20 mg kg-1 day-1.
The colitis based on disease activity index and colonic histopathology was significantly ameliorated in the DSS + Ro group. Additionally, mice in the DSS + Ro group had a thicker mucous layer than those in DSS + NS group, and muc2 mRNA expression was elevated significantly along with the mouse atonal homolog, SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets-like factor, and anterior gradient 2 genes. Moreover, tight junctions were up-regulated, whereas long myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylation of the myosin II light chain were lower in DSS + Ro mice. Similarly, after HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were treated by LPS or LPS + Ro, PPARγ activation by Ro could effectively improve the intestinal barrier, including intestinal mucus and tight junctions.
Our results demonstrate that activated PPARγ could effectively promote intestinal mucus integrity by increasing the number of goblet cells, the glycosylation of mucins, and tight junctions via an MLCK-dependent mechanism.
Organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2/SLC22A7) is an uptake transporter that plays an important role in drug disposition. Here, we investigate a potential role of liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) in regulation of Oat2 and docetaxel pharmacokinetics. Hepatoma cells (Hepa1-6 and HepG2 cells) were transfected with Lrh-1/LRH-1 expression vector or siRNA. The relative mRNA and protein levels of Oat2/OAT2 in the cells or livers of Lrh-1hep-/- mice were determined by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Transcriptional regulation of Oat2/OAT2 by Lrh-1/LRH-1 was investigated using luciferase reporter, mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with wild-type (Lrh-1fl/fl) and Lrh-1hep-/- mice after intraperitoneal injection of docetaxel. Overexpression of Lrh-1 in Hepa1-6 cells led to significant increases in Oat2 mRNA and protein. Consistently, Lrh-1 knockdown caused decreases in Oat2 mRNA and protein, as well as reduced cellular uptake of PGE2, a prototypical substrate of Oat2. Similarly, an activation effect of LRH-1 on OAT2 expression was observed in HepG2 cells. In addition, the levels of Oat2 mRNA and protein were markedly reduced in Lrh-1hep-/- mice. Lrh-1/LRH-1 induced the transcription of Oat2/OAT2 in luciferase reporter assays. Truncation analysis revealed a potential Lrh-1 response element (-716- to -702-bp) in Oat2 promoter. Direct binding of Lrh-1 to this response element was confirmed by mobility shift and ChIP assays. Furthermore, systemic exposure of docetaxel was upregulated in Lrh-1hep-/- mice due to reduced hepatic uptake. In conclusion, Lrh-1 transcriptionally regulates Oat2, thereby impacting tissue uptake and pharmacokinetics of Oat2 substrates.
Ovarian retinoid homeostasis plays an important role in the physiological function of the ovary. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) acts as the mediator for the systemic and intercellular transport of retinol and is heavily involved in cellular retinol influx, efflux, and exchange. However, the expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms of Rbp4 in the ovary remain unclear.
The expression pattern of ovarian Rbp4 was examined in immature mice during different developmental stages and in adult mice during different stages of the estrous cycle. The potential regulation and mechanisms of ovarian Rbp4 expression by estrogen and related gonadotropins in mouse ovaries were also investigated.
The present study demonstrated that the ovarian expression of Rbp4 remained constant before puberty and increased significantly in the peripubertal period. In adult female mice, the expression of Rbp4 increased at proestrus and peaked at estrus at both the mRNA and protein levels. The protein distribution of RBP4 was mainly localized in the granulosa cell and theca cell layer in follicles. In addition, the expression of Rbp4 was significantly induced by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or FSH + luteinizing hormone (LH) in combination in immature mouse (3 weeks old) ovaries in vivo and in granulosa cells cultured in vitro, both at the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, treatment with LH or 17β-estradiol did not exhibit any observable effects on ovarian Rbp4 expression. Transcription factors high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) (which have been previously shown to be involved in activation of Rbp4 transcription), also responded to FSH stimulation. In addition, H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), and the depletion of HMGA1, SF-1, and LRH-1 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), resulted in a dramatic loss of the induction of Rbp4 expression by FSH at both the mRNA and protein levels.
These data indicate that the dynamic expression of Rbp4 is mainly regulated by FSH through the cAMP-PKA pathway, involving transcriptional factors HMGA1, SF-1, and LRH-1, in the mouse ovary during different stages of development and the estrous cycle.
The present study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-219-5p in spinal cord injury (SCI) and to examine the underlying molecular mechanism. SCI rat and cell models were conducted in the current study, while reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the level of miR-219-5p in the SCI mice and neurons. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to predict the target genes of miR-219-5p, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the prediction. In addition, MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted to determine the cell viability and cell apoptosis of the neurons, respectively. Western blot analysis was also performed to detect the expression of associated proteins. The study results demonstrated that miR-219-5p was highly expressed in SCI mice and neurons, and directly targets liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). The neuron viability was significantly reduced by SCI, however, it was recovered upon transfection with an miR-219-5p inhibitor. Neuron apoptosis was notably induced by SCI and inhibited by miR-219-5p inhibition. The LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was also inhibited by SCI, while it was significantly enhanced by the miR-219-5p inhibitor. Furthermore, LRH-1 overexpression eliminated the effects of the miR-219-5p inhibitor on SCI. In conclusion, these data indicated that the miR-219-5p inhibitor served a protective role in SCI via regulating the LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in various biological processes. This nuclear receptor has critical functions in embryonic development as well as in adult homeostasis. Although the physiological functions of LRH-1 in normal breast, pancreas, and intestine have been widely investigated, the dysregulation that occurs during pathological conditions is not well understood. LRH-1 has been implicated in pancreatic, breast, and gastrointestinal cancer, where it exerts its effect of initiation and progression by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. In addition to mechanistic studies, LRH-1 agonists and antagonists are being explored. Identification and development of endogenous and synthetic ligands has been pursued using computational-based structural analysis. Through ligand identification and a thorough understanding of the pathological roles of LRH-1, new therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment based upon LRH-1 may be a desirable focus for further research. 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X protein(HBx) is a transactivator of host several cellular genes including alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) and AFP receptor(AFPR) which contributes to HBV-associated tumor development. The expression of AFP/AFPR are correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)-initial cells. But the role of AFP and AFPR in promoting occurrence of HBV-related HCC were still unclear.
A total of 71 clinical patients' liver specimens, normal human liver cells L-02 and HCC cell lines, PLC/PRF/5 were selected for analyzing the effects of HBx on expression of AFP, AFPR and Src. The expression of goal proteins were detected by Immunohistochemical stained and Western blotting; HBx-expressed vectors were constructed and transfected into L-02 cells, laser confocal microscopy was applied to observe expression and location of AFP, AFPR and Src in the normal liver cells and HCC cells, soft agar colony formation assay was used to observe colonies formed of the cells.
We confirmed HBx gives preference to promote the expression of AFP and AFPR; HBx priors to up-regulate the expression of AFPR and AFP in L-02 cells and in normal liver specimens; AFPR signal been able to stimulate Src expression. The results also indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) inhibitors Ly294002 and GDC0941 effectively suppress AFPR mediated up-regulation expression of Src in AFPR positive HCC lines.
HBx priors to drive the expression of AFP and AFPR to promote expression of Src in normal liver cells and hepatoma cells; AFP and AFPR maybe play pivotal role in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis; Targeting AFPR is an available therapeutic strategy of HCC.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF-1) mutations usually manifest in 46,XY individuals with variable degrees of disordered sex development and in 46,XX women with ovarian insufficiency. So far, there is no genotype-phenotype correlation. The broad spectrum of phenotype with NR5A1 mutations may be due to a second hit in a gene with similar function to NR5A1/SF-1. Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2) might be a good candidate. We performed in vitro studies for the interplay between SF-1, LRH-1 and DAX-1, expression profiles in human steroidogenic tissues, and NR5A2 genetic studies in a cohort (11 patients, 8 relatives, 11 families) harboring heterozygote NR5A1/SF-1 mutations. LRH-1 isoforms transactivate the CYP17A1 and HSD3B2 promoters similarly to SF-1 and compensate for SF-1 deficiency. DAX-1 inhibits SF-1- and LRH-1-mediated transactivation. LRH-1 is found expressed in human adult and fetal adrenals and testes. However, no NR5A2/LRH-1 mutations were detected in 14 individuals with heterozygote NR5A1/SF-1 mutations. These findings demonstrate that in vitro LRH-1 can act like SF-1 and compensate for its deficiency. Expression of LRH-1 in fetal testis suggests a role in male gonadal development. However, as we found no NR5A2/LRH-1 mutations, the 'second genetic hit' in SF-1 patients explaining the broad phenotypic variability remains elusive.
Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in the repression of inflammatory processes in the hepatointestinal tract. Here we report that LRH-1 is expressed in macrophages and induced by the Th2 cytokine IL-13 via a mechanism involving STAT6. We show that loss-of-function of LRH-1 in macrophages impedes IL-13-induced macrophage polarization due to impaired generation of 15-HETE PPARγ ligands. The incapacity to generate 15-HETE metabolites is at least partially caused by the compromised regulation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Mice with LRH-1-deficient macrophages are, furthermore, highly susceptible to gastrointestinal and systemic Candida albicans infection. Altogether, these results identify LRH-1 as a critical component of the anti-inflammatory and fungicidal response of alternatively activated macrophages that acts upstream from the IL-13-induced 15-HETE/PPARγ axis. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) plays an important role in the onset and progression of many cancer types. However, the role of LRH-1 in osteosarcoma has not been well investigated. In this study, the critical role of LRH-1 in osteosarcoma cells was described. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis results revealed that LRH-1 was highly overexpressed in osteosarcoma cells. LRH-1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and this phenomenon significantly inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation. Bioinformatics analysis results showed that LRH-1 contained putative binding sites of microRNA-451 (miR-451); this result was further validated through a dual-luciferase activity reporter assay. miR-451 was overexpressed in osteosarcoma cells through transfection of miR-451 mimics; miR-451 overexpression then significantly inhibited LRH-1 expression and cell proliferation. The loss of LRH-1 by siRNA or miR-451 mimics significantly impaired Wnt/β-catenin activity, leading to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Results showed that LRH-1 is implicated in osteosarcoma. Therefore, miR-451-induced suppression of LRH-1 can be a novel therapy to treat osteosarcoma. 
Little is known of the early stages of human follicular development and the complex processes that regulate follicular growth. To identify genes of potential importance, we analysed follicle-related transcripts in five populations of isolated size-matched human preantral follicles by microarray analysis. Oocyte-specific genes were found to be the most abundant and differentially expressed transcripts and included germ cell transcription factors LHX8 and SOHLH2 which were significantly down-regulated during preantral follicle development. Differentially expressed genes also included transcription factors of NOTCH signalling, IGF2, orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1, and homeobox gene HOXA7, indicating potentially important regulatory roles for these genes during early human folliculogenesis. We also found that FSHR mRNA and protein were present in the earliest stages of preantral follicles, whereas LHR was absent. In conclusion, our data identify specific oocyte and somatic genes in small human follicles that impact early follicle growth, and provide foundation for further analysis of the signalling pathways involved in early human folliculogenesis. 
The orphan nuclear receptor (NR5A2), which belongs to the NR5A subfamily of nuclear receptors, is expressed in developing and adult tissues of endodermal origin, and can contribute to the development of several cancers through regulating cell proliferation. NR5A2 (rs3790843 and rs3790844) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyping were examined in DNA samples, extracted from paraffin-embedded cancer tissue. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were collected from 944 patients with gastric cancer (GC). Associations of the 2 SNPs with the progression and prognosis in gastric cancer patients were analyzed using the SPSS version 18.0. We found that NR5A2 rs3790843 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of GC which had regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.044) or distant metastasis (p = 0.020). Our results also indicated that rs3790844 polymorphism was associated with the increased overall survival (OS) of GC patients in the dominant model (GG vs. GA/AA, HR (hazard ratio) = 0.823, 95% CI (confidence interval) = 0.679-0.997), suggesting a potential protective role of the variant A allele. Additionally, in the stratified analysis, both NR5A2 rs3790843 and rs3790844 polymorphism were associated with significantly lower risk of death in the groups of female, tumor size &gt;5 cm in a dominant model. Our results represent the first demonstration that the NR5A2 rs3790844 polymorphism is associated with increased OS of GC patients in the dominant model, and similar results were found among the female group and tumor size &gt;5 cm group for NR5A2 rs3790843 polymorphism. Further validation in other larger studies with different ethnic populations and functional evaluations are needed. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor (NR) with diverse functions in development, differentiation and metabolism and has been extensively studied in the enterohepatic system. While initially described as an orphan NR, recent studies suggest that specific phospholipids act as endogenous LRH-1 ligands. Although binding of ligands may enhance its transcriptional activation, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and binding of coregulators and other NRs have emerged as mechanisms to fine-tune the selective regulation of LRH-1 target genes. In this review article, we will discuss how LRH-1 is regulated by PTMs and binding of ligands and coregulators, and explain some metabolic consequences with a special focus on liver physiology. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has an essential role in cancer progression, notably in breast cancer. Although its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration is well documented, the molecular basis is not completely established. Here, we report that LRH-1 inhibition affects two- and three-dimensional cell proliferation of different types of breast cancer cells, including estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive and triple-negative cells. This phenotype is accompanied by the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A (aka p21(CIP1/WAF1)) in a p53-independent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that LRH-1 cooperates with FOXA1 and binds directly to CDKN1A promoter and a distal regulatory region found at -62 kb from its transcriptional start sites, allowing repression of CDKN1A transcription. LRH-1 or FOXA1 depletion induces CDKN1A upregulation by removing histone deacetylase 2 from the promoter and distal regulatory elements and permitting histone acetylation in these regions. Analysis of breast cancer samples reveals that a high LRH-1 level is inversely correlated with CDKN1A expression in breast cancer patients and is associated with poor prognosis. This study reveals a novel mechanism of control of cell proliferation by LRH-1 regulating CDKN1A transcription in breast cancer cells, independent of ERα and p53 status. Targeting LRH-1 may provide an attractive prospect for treatment of tumors that are resistant to hormonal and targeted therapy. 
The transcriptional factor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) regulates pancreatic development, and may participate in pancreatic oncogenesis through activation of growth factor signaling transduction cascades. We measured transcriptional activity of β-catenin in response to LRH1 stimulation by a Topflash reporter assay. The pancreatic cancer (PC) phenotype was then characterized by cell migration, wound healing, invasion, and sphere formation in vitro, as well as tumor formation and distant metastatic spread in vivo. We compared results between vector control and LRH1-overexpressing stable PC cell lines. In addition, tumor burden, angiogenesis, histologic characteristics, and hepatic spread were assessed in orthotopic and experimental liver metastatic murine models. Expression of downstream LRH1 related genes was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry in PC cell lines and human tumor specimens. Specific inhibition of LRH1 expression and function was accomplished by shRNAs "knockdown" experiments. It was found that LRH1 enhanced transcriptional activity of β-catenin and the expression of downstream target genes (c-Myc, MMP2/9), as well as promoted migration, wound healing, invasion, and sphere formation of PC cell lines. Specific inhibition of LRH1 by shRNAs reduced cell migration, invasion, sphere formation and expression of c-Myc and MMP2/9 target genes. Mice injected with LRH1 overexpressing stable PC cells developed tumors with increased size and exhibited striking hepatic metastatic spread. More important, LRH1 was overexpressed in PC tumors compared to adjacent normal pancreas. Our findings demonstrate that LRH1 overexpression is associated with increased PC growth and metastatic spread, indicating that LRH1-targeted therapy could inhibit tumor progression. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that belongs to the NR5A subgroup of nuclear receptors. LRH-1 induces key genes to regulate metabolic process, ovarian function, cancer cell proliferation, and steroidogenesis. In the breast, LRH-1 modulates and synergizes with endogenous estrogen signaling to promote breast cancer cell proliferation. We used small interfering RNA knockdown strategies to deplete LRH-1 in breast cancer cells and followed with microarray analysis to identify LRH-1-dependent mechanisms. We identified key genes involved in TGF-β signaling to be highly responsive to LRH-1 knockdown. This relationship was validated in 2 breast cancer cell lines overexpressing LRH-1 in vitro and in a novel transgenic mouse with targeted LRH-1 overexpression in mammary epithelial cells. Notably, TGF-β signaling was activated in LRH-1-overexpressing breast cancer cells and mouse mammary glands. Further analyses of mammary gross morphology revealed a significant reduction in mammary lateral budding after LRH-1 overexpression. These findings suggest that the altered mammary morphogenesis in LRH-1 transgenic animals is mediated via enhanced TGF-β expression. The regulation of TGF-β isoforms and SMAD2/3-mediated downstream signaling by LRH-1 also implicates a potential contribution of LRH-1 in breast cancer. Collectively, these data demonstrate that LRH-1 regulates TGF-β expression and downstream signaling in mouse mammary glands. 
Obesity is a global health problem that increases the risk of several common diseases. Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) has an important role in steroid hormone metabolism, which influences body weight. Whether LRH-1 gene deletion causes obesity is yet to be clarified. In this study using LRH-1 heterozygous knockout (LRH-1(+/-)) mice, we investigated the role of LRH-1 on body weight gain and glucose and lipid metabolism. LRH-1(+/-) mice showed mild but significant body weight gains compared with wild-type littermate mice after being fed a high-fat diet. We performed glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests and did not find any significant differences between wild-type and LRH-1(+/-) mice. To clarify how LRH-1 gene deletion affects body weight gain, we measured food intake, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient, spontaneous activity and rectal temperature, and found no significant differences between wild-type and LRH-1(+/-) mice fed a normal diet and a high-fat diet. The results suggest that heterozygous gene deletion of LRH-1 causes body weight gains without any apparent worsening of glucose and lipid metabolism. Identifying the effects of LRH-1 on body weight will aid in understanding the pathogenesis of obesity. 
Tumor characteristics are decisive in the determination of treatment strategy for patients with breast cancer. Patients with estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancer can benefit from long-term hormonal treatment. Nonetheless, the majority of patients will develop resistance to these therapies. Here, we investigated the role of the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) in antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells. We identified genome-wide LRH-1-binding sites using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing), uncovering preferential binding to regions distal to transcriptional start sites. We further characterized these LRH-1-binding sites by integrating overlapping layers of specific chromatin marks, revealing that many LRH-1-binding sites are active and could be involved in long-range enhancer-promoter looping. Combined with transcriptome analysis of LRH-1-depleted cells, these results show that LRH-1 regulates specific subsets of genes involved in cell proliferation in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the LRH-1 transcriptional program is highly associated with a signature of poor outcome and high-grade breast cancer tumors in vivo. Herein, we report the genome-wide location and molecular function of LRH-1 in breast cancer cells and reveal its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancers, notably for tumors resistant to treatments currently used in therapies.
Liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1), directs the development and differentiation of embryonic pancreas, and is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (PC). We hypothesized that LRH1 promotes PC growth. Cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in nude mice were compared between empty vector-transfected (control) and stable LRH1-overexpressed PC cell lines. The subsequent tumor burden, vasculature development, and histologic features were evaluated. LRH1 overexpression enhanced the expression of downstream target genes (cyclin D1/E1) and stimulated cell proliferation in PC cell lines. LRH1 upregulated cyclin E1 truncated T1/T2 isoforms expression which may occur through ERα-calpain1 signaling. Compared with the control, LRH1 overexpressing stable cells generated tumors with increased weight, proliferation index and enhanced angiogenesis. Cyclin D1/E1 and calpain1 were overexpressed in human PC tumors compared to adjacent normal pancreas. These observations demonstrate that LRH1 promotes PC growth and angiogenesis, suggesting that LRH1 is a driving factor in tumorigenesis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. 
Recent studies have demonstrated the possible function of miR-139-5p in tumorigenesis. However, the exact mechanism of miR-139-5p in cancer remains unclear. In this study, the association of miR-139-5p expression with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was evaluated in 106 pairs of esophageal cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue from ESCC patients. The tumor suppressive features of miR-139-5p were measured by evaluating cell proliferation and cell cycle state, migratory activity and invasion capability, as well as apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the target gene regulated by miR-139-5p. The mRNA level of NR5A2, the target gene of miR-139-5p, was determined in ESCC patients. Results showed that reduced miR-139-5p level was associated with lymph node metastases of ESCC. MiR-139-5p was investigated to induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and to suppress the invasive capability of esophageal carcinoma cells by targeting the 3'UTR of oncogenic NR5A2. Cyclin E1 and MMP9 were confirmed to participate in cell cycle arrest and invasive suppression induced by NR5A2, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed the significantly negative correlation between miR-139-5p and NR5A2 expression. The results suggest that miR-139-5p exerts a growth- and invasiveness-suppressing function in human ESCCs, which demonstrates that miR-139-5p is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis and is a therapeutic target for ESCC. 
5-Aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) is a rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis in mammals. Heme is essential for the catalytic activities of P450 enzymes including steroid metabolic enzymes. Nuclear receptor 5A (NR5A) family proteins, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) play pivotal roles in regulation of steroidogenic enzymes. Recently, we showed that expression of SF-1/LRH-1 induces differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into steroidogenic cells. In this study, genome-wide analysis revealed that ALAS1 was a novel SF-1-target gene in differentiated mesenchymal stem cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays revealed that SF-1/LRH-1 up-regulated ALAS1 gene transcription in steroidogenic cells via binding to a 3.5-kb upstream region of ALAS1. The ALAS1 gene was up-regulated by overexpression of SF-1/LRH-1 in steroidogenic cells and down-regulated by knockdown of SF-1 in these cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, a coactivator of nuclear receptors, also strongly coactivated expression of NR5A-target genes. Reporter analysis revealed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α strongly augmented ALAS1 gene transcription caused by SF-1 binding to the 3.5-kb upstream region. Finally knockdown of ALAS1 resulted in reduced progesterone production by steroidogenic cells. These results indicate that ALAS1 is a novel NR5A-target gene and participates in steroid hormone production.
The development of atherosclerosis is countered by the reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Stein et al. (2014) establish LRH-1 as an important regulator of reverse cholesterol transport and identify SUMOylation as a primary mode of LRH-1 regulation.
