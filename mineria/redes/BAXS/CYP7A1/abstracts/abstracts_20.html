<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>A 9-month-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat presented with a history of episodic ptyalism, lethargy and abnormal behaviour. The clinical signs together with elevated pre- and post-prandial bile acid concentrations were consistent with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In the absence of a portosystemic shunt (PSS) on abdominal ultrasound, medical management of HE was established with a protein-restricted diet and lactulose and the neurological signs resolved. Following an episode of acute vomiting and haemorrhagic diarrhoea at 19 months of age abdominal ultrasonography was repeated. The portal vein could not be demonstrated ultrasonographically; instead, portal vein tributaries were tortuous and communicated with the caudal vena cava (CdVC) at the level of the left kidney. CT angiography (CTA) confirmed the absence of the portal vein. CTA demonstrated the tortuous terminations of the portal tributaries, and several systemic veins, draining into the CdVC via a large-diameter paracaval vessel at the level of the left kidney. Gastrointestinal signs were stabilised and medical management for HE of a protein-restricted diet and lactulose was re-established.
Congenital absence of the portal vein has not been described previously in the cat and should be considered in cats presenting with signs suggestive of a PSS and HE. The portal vein in the cat can be demonstrated using ultrasound, but complex congenital vascular malformations of the portal or systemic abdominal veins should be characterised using CTA and further distinguished from other vascular anomalies that may present with similar ultrasonographic features.
Excessive amounts of bile acids entering the colon due to bile acid malabsorption cause chronic bile acid diarrhoea. Diagnosis is possible by measuring the retention fraction of orally ingested 75 Selenium homotaurocholic acid (SeHCAT). The knowledge of long-term effects of medical treatment is sparse.
To describe diarrhoea, adherence to treatment, treatment effects and quality of life in a large, well-defined cohort of patients with bile acid diarrhoea.
A retrospective survey was performed among 594 patients with bile acid malabsorption verified by SeHCAT scans at our unit between 2003 and 2016. Questionnaires about medical history, diarrhoea, use of medication, and quality of life scores were mailed to all patients.
Among 594 patients 377 (69%) responded. Among respondents, 121 (32%) had bile acid diarrhoea due to ileal disease or resection (type 1), 198 (52%) idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea (type 2) and 58 (16%) bile acid diarrhoea due to other non-ileal disease, mainly cholecystectomy (type 3). At follow-up, half of the patients, 184 (50%), reported improvement of diarrhoea. However, 273 patients (74%) still reported diarrhoea and 234 (62%) regularly used anti-diarrhoeal medication. In spite of treatment, 235 (64%) considered reduced quality of life by diarrhoea and 184 (50%) reported that diarrhoea was unaltered or worse than before established diagnosis.
Many patients with bile acid diarrhoea continue to have bothersome diarrhoea in spite of correct diagnosis and treatment.
Gut metagenomic sequences provide a rich source of microbial genes, the majority of which are annotated by homology or unknown. Genes and gene pathways that encode enzymes catalyzing biotransformation of host bile acids are important to identify in gut metagenomic sequences due to the importance of bile acids in gut microbiome structure and host physiology. Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs) are pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes with stereospecificity and regiospecificity for bile acid and steroid hydroxyl groups. HSDHs have been identified in several protein families, including medium-chain and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase families as well as the aldo-keto reductase family. These protein families are large and contain diverse functionalities, making prediction of HSDH-encoding genes difficult and necessitating biochemical characterization. We located a gene cluster in Eggerthella sp. CAG:298 predicted to encode three HSDHs (CDD59473, CDD59474, and CDD59475) and synthesized the genes for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli We then screened bile acid substrates against the purified recombinant enzymes. CDD59475 is a novel 12α-HSDH, and we determined that CDD59474 (3α-HSDH) and CDD59473 (3β-HSDH) constitute novel enzymes in an iso-bile acid pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of these HSDHs with other gut bacterial HSDHs and closest homologues in the database revealed predictable clustering of HSDHs by function and identified several likely HSDH sequences from bacteria isolated or sequenced from diverse mammalian and avian gut samples.IMPORTANCE Bacterial HSDHs have the potential to significantly alter the physicochemical properties of bile acids, with implications for increased/decreased toxicity for gut bacteria and the host. The generation of oxo-bile acids is known to inhibit host enzymes involved in glucocorticoid metabolism and may alter signaling through nuclear receptors such as farnesoid X receptor and G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5. Biochemical or similar approaches are required to fill in many gaps in our ability to link a particular enzymatic function with a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. In this regard, we have identified a novel 12α-HSDH and a novel set of genes encoding an iso-bile acid pathway (3α-HSDH and 3β-HSDH) involved in epimerization and detoxification of harmful secondary bile acids.
Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fish and evaluated for their γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing abilities. Out of thirty-two isolates, Lactobacillus brevis RK03 showed the highest GABA production ability. The effects of various fermentation parameters including initial glutamic acid level, culture temperature, initial pH, and incubation time on GABA production were investigated via a singleparameter optimization strategy. For industrial large-scale production, a low-cost GABA producing medium (GM) broth was developed for fermentation with L. brevis RK03. We found that an optimized GM broth recipe of 1% glucose; 2.5% yeast extract; 2 ppm each of CaCO₃, MnSO₄, and Tween 80; and 10 μM pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) resulted in a maximum GABA yield of 62,523 mg/L after 88 h following the addition of 650 mM monosodium glutamate (MSG), for a conversion rate of 93.28%. Our data provide a practical approach for the highly efficient and economic production of GABA. In addition, L. brevis RK03 is highly resistant to gastric acid and bovine bile salt. Thus, the discovery of Lactobacillus strains with the ability to synthesize GABA may offer new opportunities in the design of improved health-promoting functional foods.
Psoriasis is a common, chronic, systemic inflammatory skin disease, the etiology and pathogenesis is unclear. An untargeted high-throughput metabonomics method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was applied to study the serum metabolic changes in psoriasis vulgaris patients, and to discover serum potential biomarkers for identification, diagnosis and exploring pathogenesis of psoriasis. The serum metabolic profiles from 150 subjects (75 psoriasis patients and 75 healthy controls) were acquired, the raw spectrometric data were processed by multivariate statistical analysis, and 44 potential biomarkers were screened out and identified. The potential biomarkers were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis, indicated the pathogenesis of psoriasis may be related to the disturbed metabolic pathways.
Changes over time in the presenting features and clinical course of patients with primary biliary cholangitis are poorly described. We sought to describe temporal trends in patient and disease characteristics over a 44-year period across a large international primary biliary cholangitis cohort of 4,805 patients diagnosed between 1970 and 2014, from 17 centers across Europe and North America. Patients were divided into five cohorts according to their year of diagnosis: 1970-1979 (n = 143), 1980-1989 (n = 858), 1990-1999 (n = 1,754), 2000-2009 (n = 1,815), and ≥2010 (n = 235). Age at diagnosis, disease stage, response to ursodeoxycholic acid, and clinical outcomes were compared. Mean age at diagnosis increased incrementally by 2-3 years per decade from 46.9 ± 10.1 years in the 1970s to 57.0 ± 12.1 years from 2010 onward (P &lt; 0.001). The female to male ratio (9:1) and antimitochondrial antibody positivity (90%) were not significantly variable. The proportion of patients presenting with mild biochemical disease (according to Rotterdam staging) increased from 41.3% in the 1970s to 72.2% in the 1990s (P &lt; 0.001) and remained relatively stable thereafter. Patients with a mild histological stage at diagnosis increased from 60.4% (1970-1989) to 76.5% (1990-2014) (P &lt; 0.001). Correspondingly, response to ursodeoxycholic acid according to Paris-I criteria increased; 51.7% in the 1970s and 70.5% in the 1990s (P &lt; 0.001). Recent decades were also characterized by lower decompensation rates (18.5% in the 1970s to 5.8% in the 2000s, P &lt; 0.001) and higher 10-year transplant-free survival (48.4%, 68.7%, 79.7%, and 80.1% for each respective cohort; P &lt; 0.001).
In recent decades, a pattern of primary biliary cholangitis presentation consistent with an older age at diagnosis alongside reduced disease severity has been noted; the observed trends may be explained by an increase in routine testing of liver function and/or a changing environmental trigger. (Hepatology 2018;67:1920-1930).
Members of the genus Bifidobacterium include gut commensals that are particularly abundant among the microbial communities residing in the gut of healthy breast-fed infants, where their presence has been linked to many beneficial host effects. Next-generation DNA sequencing and comparative and functional genome methodologies have been shown to be particularly useful in exploring the diversity of this genus. These combined approaches have allowed the identification of genetic features related to bifidobacterial establishment in the gut, involving host-microbe as well as microbe-microbe interactions. Among these, proteinaceous structures, which protrude from the bacterial surface, i.e. pili or fimbriae, and exopolysaccharidic cell surface layers or capsules represent crucial features that assist in their colonization and persistence in the gut. As bifidobacteria are colonizers of the large intestine, they have to be able to cope with various sources of osmotic, oxidative, bile and acid stress during their transit across the gastric barrier and the small intestine. Bifidobacterial genomes thus encode various survival mechanisms, such as molecular chaperones and efflux pumps, to overcome such challenges. Bifidobacteria represent part of an anaerobic gut community, and feed on nondigestible carbohydrates through a specialized fermentative metabolic pathway, which in turn produces growth substrates for other members of the gut community. Conversely, bifidobacteria may also be dependent on other (bifido)bacteria to access host- and diet-derived glycans, and these complex co-operative interactions, based on resource sharing and cross-feeding strategies, represent powerful driving forces that shape gut microbiota composition.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most common liver disease in pregnancy. Although it was shown that multiple pregnancy and hormone therapies increase the risk of ICP, there is limited information that compared spontaneous fertilization and in vitro fertilization (IVF) from the aspect of developing ICP. In our study, we investigated the potential relationship between ICP and IVF/ spontaneous pregnancy.
We reviewed the records (between June 2007 and December 2014) of pregnancies with ICP who were referred to gastroenterology clinics in three different hospitals. Fifty-nine pregnancies (43 spontaneous fertilization, 16 IVF) with ICP were analyzed from the aspect of age, fertilization type, multiple/singleton pregnancy, delivery week, and biochemical results.
We found that serum bile acid levels were higher in the IVF group than the spontaneous fertilization group (32.8 ± 20 vs 19.6 ± 19 μmol/L; p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between serum bile acid levels and gestational age (r = -0.42, p &lt; 0.01) in the whole group. There was no difference between IVF and spontaneous fertilization groups in term of age, onset time of symptoms, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and direct bilirubin levels, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and platelet count.
Our results suggest that the serum bile acid levels are higher in IVF than in spontaneous pregnancies with ICP, but its clinical implications are not clear. Further prospective studies with large number of ICP cases are needed to clarify the effect of IVF on ICP.How to cite this article: Bolukbas FF, Bolukbas C, Balaban HY, Aygun C, Ignak S, Ergul E, Yazicioglu M, Ersahin SS.

No data on primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) are available in Switzerland. We established a national patient cohort to obtain information on PBC phenotypes and disease course in Switzerland. Local databases in all university hospitals and in two large secondary centers were searched for case finding. In addition, all primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists, and dermatologists were invited to contribute patients from their own medical records. PBC diagnosis was centrally reviewed. Five hundred one PBC patients were identified, 474 were included in data analysis, and 449 of them were enrolled by tertiary centers. The catchment area accounts for approximately one third of the Swiss population or approximately 2.8 million inhabitants. The median age at diagnosis was 53 years, 84% were women, and 86% were anti-mitochondrial antibody positive. The median follow-up was 5.4 years, 12.6% experienced a liver-related endpoint. Splenomegaly was present at diagnosis in one quarter of patients and in half of male patients. Approximately one third were non-responders to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The median transplant-free survival at 10 years was 85%. The following variables were independently associated with poor outcome: low platelet count at baseline (HR = 0.99, p &lt; 0.0001), elevated alkaline phosphatase at baseline (HR = 1.36, p &lt; 0.0001), elevated bilirubin at baseline (HR = 1.11, p = 0.001), and elevated alanine aminotransaminase (HR = 1.35, p = 0.04) after 12 months of UDCA therapy. The AUROC for the UK-PBC risk score at 5, 10, and 15 years was 0.82. The AUROC for the Globe score at 5, 10, and 15 years was 0.77. Patients included in this study are currently being enrolled in a prospective nationwide registry with biobank, taking advantage of the collaboration network generated by this study. Our study provides the first snapshot of PBC in Switzerland, describing a diagnostic delay with one quarter of patients diagnosed when already in the cirrhotic stage. We were also able to externally validate the UK-PBC risk score and the Globe score. The ongoing nationwide prospective registry will be fundamental to improve disease awareness and interdisciplinary collaborations and will serve as a platform for clinical and translational research.

The human gut is home to a large and diverse microbial community, comprising about 1,000 bacterial species. The gut microbiota exists in a symbiotic relationship with its host, playing a decisive role in the host's nutrition, immunity and metabolism. Accumulating studies have revealed the associations between gut dysbiosis or some special bacteria and various cancers. Emerging data suggest that gut microbiota can modulate the effectiveness of cancer therapies, especially immunotherapy. Manipulating the microbial populations with therapeutic intent has become a hot topic of cancer research, and the most dramatic manipulation of gut microbiota refers to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy individuals to patients. FMT has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy against Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and it is highly recommended for the treatment of recurrent or refractory CDI. Lately, interest is growing in the therapeutic potential of FMT for other diseases, including cancers. We briefly reviewed the current researches about gut microbiota and its link to cancer, and then summarized the recent preclinical and clinical evidence to indicate the potential of FMT in cancer management as well as cancer-treatment associated complications. We also presented the rationale of FMT for cancer management such as reconstruction of intestinal microbiota, amelioration of bile acid metabolism, and modulation of immunotherapy efficacy. This article would help to better understand this new therapeutic approach for cancer patients by targeting gut microbiota.
Treatment guidelines have proliferated in cardiology, although most guideline recommendations are not supported by clinical trial evidence. What is considered to be a normal cholesterol level has progressively declined over the past 50 years, with the increasing realization that "normal" is far from optimal and that lower is better. The first important United States and Canadian cholesterol guidelines were published in 1988, and recommended diet for 6 months to be followed by consideration of bile acid sequestrants or nicotinic acid. Over the ensuing 25 years guidelines have changed rapidly and dramatically in response to a large number of definitive clinical trials, usually with statins. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets have moved progressively lower, and in some guidelines, have been abandoned entirely. The concept of selecting patients for treatment according to the absolute risk reduction expected from treatment on the basis of clinical trial data seems to be a rational approach. For secondary prevention, some patients are still untreated or undertreated, presenting an opportunity for improving outcomes.
Hepatitis E is an important zoonosis that is prevalent in China. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a pathogen that affects humans and animals and endangers public health in China. In this study, the detection of HEV epidemics in swine in Sichuan Province, China, was carried out by nested real-time PCR. A total of 174 stool samples and 160 bile samples from swine in Sichuan Province were examined. In addition, software was used to analyse the biological evolution of HEV. The results showed that within 2 years of swine HEV (SHEV) infection in China, SHEV was first detected in Sichuan Province. HEV was endemic in Sichuan; the positive rate for pig farms was 11.1%, and the total positive sample rate was 10.5%. The age of swine with the highest positive rate (17.9%) was 5-9 weeks. The examined swine species in order of highest to lowest HEV infection rates were Chenghua pig, Large White, Duroc, Pietrain, Landrace and Hampshire. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis showed that the HEV epidemic in swine in Sichuan Province was related to genotype IV, which had the highest homology to HEV in Beijing. Sichuan strains have greater variation than Chinese representative strains, which may indicate the presence of new HEV strains.
Decellularization of thick tissue is challenging and varying. Therefore, we tried to establish a multifactorial approach for reliable aortic wall decellularization.
Porcine aortic walls were decellularized according to different procedures. Decellularization was performed for 24 (G1), 48 (G2), and 72 h (G3) with a solution of 0.5% desoxycholate and 0.5% dodecyl sulfate. The procedure was characterized using intermittent washing steps, the inclusion of sonication as well as DNase and α-galactosidase treatment. The decellularization efficiency was measured by the evaluation of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and hematoxylin and eosin staining and quantitative DNA assays. Pentachrome and picrosirius red staining, scanning electron microscopy as well as glycosaminoglycan assays were performed to evaluate the effect of the procedure on the extracellular matrix.
4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a large amount of remaining nuclei in all groups. However, consecutive DNase treatment had a significant effect. While the remaining DNA was detected in some samples of G1 and G2, samples of G3 were fully decellularized. Glycosaminoglycan content was significantly reduced to 50% after 24 h (G1) but remained constant for G2 and G3. Picrosirius red staining revealed an intact and stable collagen network without any visible defects. Pentachrome staining substantiated these results. Nonetheless, the fiber network remains intact, which could be confirmed by reflection electron microscopy analysis.
In this study, we developed a procedure that grants successful decellularization of porcine aortic wall while maintaining the fibrous microstructure. We highlighted the significant effect of DNase and α-galactosidase treatment. In addition, we could show the need for a multifactorial treatment and comprehensive evaluation protocols for thick tissue decellularization.
Intestinal bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently developed microbial profiling techniques are beginning to shed light on the nature of the changes in the gut microbiota that accompany NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this review, we summarize the role of gut microbiota in the development of NAFLD, NASH, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We highlight the mechanisms by which gut microbiota contribute to NAFLD/NASH, including through alterations in gut epithelial permeability, choline metabolism, endogenous alcohol production, release of inflammatory cytokines, regulation of hepatic Toll-like receptor (TLR), and bile acid metabolism. In addition, we analyze possible mechanisms for enhanced hepatic carcinogenesis, including alterations in bile acid metabolism, release of inflammatory cytokines, and expression of TLR-4. Finally, we describe therapeutic approaches for NAFLD/NASH and preventive strategies for HCC involving modulation of the intestinal microbiota or affected host pathways. Although recent studies have provided useful information, large-scale prospective studies are required to better characterize the intestinal microbiota and metabolome, in order to demonstrate a causative role for changes in the gut microbiota in the etiology of NAFLD/NASH, to identify new therapeutic strategies for NAFLD/NASH, and to develop more effective methods of preventing HCC.
(Aim) Bacterial infection underlies the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including acute and chronic inflammation. Here, we investigated a possible role for bacterial infection in the progression of chronic pancreatitis. (Materials and Methods) Pancreatic juice was obtained from patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 20) or duodenal cancer/bile duct cancer (n = 16) and subjected to PCR using universal primers for the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Bacterial species were identified by PCR using bile samples from four pancreatic cancer patients. PCR products were subcloned into T-vectors, and the sequences were then analyzed. Immunohistochemical and serologic analyses for Enterococcus faecalis infection were performed on a large cohort of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer and on mice with caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis. The effect of E. faecalis antigens on cytokine secretion by pancreatic cancer cells was also investigated. (Results) We found that 29 of 36 pancreatic juice samples were positive for bacterial DNA. Enterococcus and Enterobacter species were detected primarily in bile, which is thought to be a pathway for bacterial infection of the pancreas. Enterococcus faecalis was also detected in pancreatic tissue from chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients; antibodies to E. faecalis capsular polysaccharide were elevated in serum from chronic pancreatitis patients. Enterococcus-specific antibodies and pancreatic tissue-associated E. faecalis were detected in mice with caerulein-induced chronic pancreatitis. Addition of Enterococcus lipoteichoic acid and heat-killed bacteria induced expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines by pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. (Conclusion) Infection with E. faecalis may be involved in chronic pancreatitis progression, ultimately leading to development of pancreatic cancer.
FXR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which regulates the expression of various genes involved in bile acid, lipid and glucose metabolism. Targeting FXR with small molecules has been exploited to treat lipid-related disorders and diseases such as cholestasis, gallstones and hepatic disorders. In this work, we expand the existing pool of known FXR agonists using a fast hit-to-lead structure-based pharmacophore and docking screening protocol. A set of 25 molecules was selected after screening a large database of commercial chemicals, and experimental tests were carried out to demonstrate their ability to activate FXR. Three novel FXR agonists are reported, namely, one full agonist, more efficient than the endogenous ligand chenodeoxycholic acid, and two partial agonists.
A recently developed human norovirus cell culture system revealed that the presence of bile enhanced or was an essential requirement for the growth of certain genotypes. Before this discovery, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) were the only well-studied cofactor known for human noroviruses, and there was evidence that several genotypes poorly bound HBGAs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how human norovirus capsids interact with bile acids. We found that bile acids had low-micromolar affinities for GII.1, GII.10, and GII.19 capsids but did not bind GI.1, GII.3, GII.4, or GII.17. We showed that bile acid bound at a partially conserved pocket on the norovirus capsid-protruding (P) domain using X-ray crystallography. Amino acid sequence alignment and structural analysis delivered an explanation of selective bile acid binding. Intriguingly, we discovered that binding of the bile acid was the critical step to stabilize several P domain loops that optimally placed an essential amino acid side chain (Asp375) to bind HBGAs in an otherwise HBGA nonbinder (GII.1). Furthermore, bile acid enhanced HBGA binding for a known HBGA binder (GII.10). Altogether, these new data suggest that bile acid functions as a loop-stabilizing regulator and enhancer of HBGA binding for certain norovirus genotypes.IMPORTANCE Given that human norovirus virions likely interact with bile acid during a natural infection, our evidence that an HBGA nonbinder (GII.1) can be converted to an HBGA binder after bile acid binding is of major significance. Our data provide direct evidence that, like HBGAs, bile acid interaction on the capsid is an important cofactor for certain genotypes. However, more unanswered questions seem to arise from these new discoveries. For example, is there an association between the bile acid requirement and the prevalence of certain genotypes? That is, the GII.1 and GII.10 (bile acid binders) genotypes rarely caused outbreaks, whereas the GII.4 and GII.17 genotypes (bile acid nonbinders) were responsible for large epidemics. Therefore, it seems plausible that certain genotypes require bile acids, whereas others have modified their bile acid requirements on the capsid.
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a slowly progressive chronic cholestatic liver disease that, in a subgroup of patients, may result in liver failure or death. The definition of specific risk profiles, i.e. risk stratification, is of critical importance for the identification of these subgroups and thereby the targeting of care. Over the last few years large multicentre cohort studies have improved our knowledge regarding factors associated with progressive disease. Stratification based on biochemical response to ursodoxycholic acid provides a readily available measure to identify groups that might benefit from additional therapies to further improve prognosis. In addition, serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are now considered the most robustly validated biomarkers of long-term outcome in PBC and are used as endpoints in clinical trials. The GLOBE score and UK-PBC risk score enable us to quantify the risk of future events for the individual patient, allowing more individualized risk prediction. In this review, we discuss both established prognostic factors and newly developed tools to estimate prognosis in PBC, highlighting their strengths, limitations and applicability in clinical practice.
Herein we present a clinical case of the Caroli syndrome caused by the compound heterozygous mutation in the PKHD1 gene. Histopathological assessment of liver detected biliary cirrhosis, numerous dilated bile ducts of various sizes, hyperplastic cholangiocytes containing a large amount of acid mucopolysaccharides, decreased ß-tubulin expression and increased proliferation of cholangiocytes. A significant proportion of hepatic tissue was composed of giant cysts lined with a single layer of cholangiocytes, containing pus and bile in its lumen and surrounded by granulation tissue. An accumulation of neutrophils in the lumen of the bile ducts was observed, as well as an infiltration of the ducts and cysts surrounding connective tissue by CD4+ and to a lesser extent CD8+ lymphocytes. This may be caused by the expression of HLA-DR by cholangiocytes. Atrophy and desquamation of the epithelium of collecting tubules with the formation of microcysts were detected in the kidneys without a clinically significant loss of renal function. Morphopathogenetic mechanisms of the Caroli syndrome can be targets for a potential pathogenetic therapy and prevention of its manifestations and complications.
Increasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and a specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing.
In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid, and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid:CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.
We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut-liver-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD.
Liver cancer results in a high degree of mortality, especially among men. As fatty liver disease is a risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma, we investigated the role of dietary fat type in tumor promotion by high-fat diets in mice after initiation with the chemical carcinogen diethyl nitrosamine. Tumor incidence and multiplicity were significantly greater in males than those in females. In males, fat type had complex effects on tumorigenesis. Preneoplastic foci were most prevalent in mice fed a polyunsaturated fat diet enriched in docosahexaenoic acid, whereas carcinomas and large visible liver tumors were significantly greater in mice fed a saturated fat diet made with cocoa butter relative to mice fed mono- or polyunsaturated fats. Different mechanisms thus seemed involved in early and late tumor promotion. The hepatic transcriptome and gut microbiome were assessed for traits associated with tumorigenesis. Hepatic expression of more than 20% of all genes was affected by sex, whereas fat type affected fewer genes. In males, the saturated fat diet induced expression of the proto-oncogene Agap2 and affected the expression of several cytochrome P450 genes, and genes involved in lipid, bile acid and fatty acid metabolism. The gut microbiome had a higher level of genus Akkermansia and a lower level of Firmicutes in females than in males. Males fed saturated fat had an altered microbiome, including an enrichment of the genus Coprococcus. In conclusion, sex and the dietary fat type affect the gut microbiome, the hepatic transcriptome and ultimately hepatic tumor growth.
Endogenous biomarkers can be clinically relevant tools for the assessment of transporter function in vivo and corresponding drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The aim of this study was to perform systematic evaluation of plasma data obtained for 20 endogenous molecules in the same healthy subjects (n = 8-12) in the absence and presence of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitor rifampicin (600 mg, single dose). The extent of rifampicin DDI magnitude [the ratio of the plasma concentration-time area under the curve (AUCR)], estimated fraction transported (fT), and baseline variability was compared across the biomarkers and relative to rosuvastatin and coproporphyrin I (CPI). Out of the 20 biomarkers investigated tetradecanedioate (TDA), hexadecanedioate (HDA), glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), and coproporphyrin III (CPIII) showed the high AUCR (2.1-8.5) and fT (0.5-0.76) values, indicative of substantial OATP1B-mediated transport. A significant positive correlation was observed between the individual GDCA and TDCA AUCRs and the magnitude of rosuvastatin-rifampicin interaction. The CPI and CPIII AUCRs were significantly correlated, but no clear trend was established with the rosuvastatin AUCR. Moderate interindividual variability (15%-62%) in baseline exposure and AUCR was observed for TDA, HDA, and CPIII. In contrast, bile acids demonstrated high interindividual variability (69%-113%) and significant decreases in baseline plasma concentrations during the first 4 hours. This comprehensive analysis in the same individuals confirms that none of the biomarkers supersede CPI in the evaluation of OATP1B-mediated DDI risk. Monitoring of CPI and GDCA/TDCA may be beneficial for dual OATP1B/sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitors with consideration of challenges associated with large inter- and intraindividual variability observed for bile acids. Benefit of monitoring combined biomarkers (CPI, one bile acid and one fatty acid) needs to be confirmed with larger data sets and against multiple OATP1B clinical probes and perpetrators.
Small hepatocytes have hepatocyte-like characteristics and high proliferation activity. Most small hepatocyte studies report on in vitro rat or human hepatocytes. Only a few studies of small hepatocytes after bile duct ligation have been reported, and none of these have focused on these cells in birds. In this study, small hepatocytes appearing in bile duct ligation chicken liver were examined using the morphological method with histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural studies. Nine Boris Brown hens (over 744-d old) were used. In all chickens, both the common hepatoenteric duct and hepatocystic duct were ligated, and the livers were examined 1, 4, 6, 9, and 13 weeks after bile duct ligation. Histologically, the small cells were half the size of normal liver cells, and mitotic figures were often observed. The nuclei showed two forms: large and small. Many small cells were negative for periodic acid-Schiff stain, but positive cells were rarely observed. The cells existed in colonies on the side of the sinusoid of the hepatic lamina. Immunohistochemically, the small cells with large nuclei were strongly positive for CD44, albumin and proliferation cell nuclear antigen, and the cells with small nuclei were weakly positive. In the CD44-positive cell colony, negative cells were often observed to have mature hepatocyte-like morphology. Moreover, many of the cells were PAN cytokeratin negative. Ultrastructurally, the small cells had more nuclei with rich heterochromatin, poor cytoplasmic organelles, and narrow cytoplasm with a high electron density than mature hepatocytes. Moreover, cells having a middle ultrastructural characteristic existed between the small cells and mature hepatocytes. The small hepatocellular colony of the chicken appeared as a regeneration-related change in the liver after bile duct ligation. The cell had high cell proliferation activity and morphological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of the mammalian small hepatocyte, as well as a similar progenitor cell.
The acquisition of high-quality quantitative dataset is the prerequisite for large-scale targeted metabolomics. However, the goal is usually dampened by the complexity of the biological matrices in terms of structural diversity, concentration span, and polarity range. We attempted herein to propose an analytical approach being able to circumvent these technical obstacles, and medicinal bile was employed as a proof of concept. In the liquid chromatography (LC) domain, reversed phase LC and hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography were coupled in series, namely RPLC-HILIC, to yield appropriate chromatographic behavior for each component regardless of the polarity. In-depth chemical characterization and widely quantitative analysis were successively conducted in the mass spectrometry (MS) domain. Hybrid ion trap-time of flight MS was jointly deployed with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap MS for metabolite searching because of their orthogonal natures. Afterwards, a tailored MRM strategy that integrated online parameter optimization, ion intensity tailoring, and scheduled monitoring, was subsequently constructed to accomplish comprehensive quantitation although authentic compounds weren't involved and concentration span was quite large. Calibration curve was constructed for each detected identity by preparing and serially diluting the universal metabolome standard (UMS) solution that merged chemical information from all bile samples. Quasi-contents of 164 components including bile acids, sterols, eicosanoids, amino acids, lipids, flavonoids, and so forth, were gained by applying those regressive calibration curves and replaced the role of peak areas to serve as the variables for multivariate statistical analysis. In particular, the concentration ratio between tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) that were exactly co-eluted as a single peak was calculated from the intensity specific value of m/z 498 &gt; 80 over 498 &gt; 124. Different metabolome occurred among various animal bile samples, and significant variations were also observed for different batches of bear bile powders. Bile acids acted as the indicative components in either discrimination. Overall, RPLC-HILIC-tailored MRM enabled quantitative metabolome profiling of medicinal bile and was thereby a promising analytical tool for large-scale targeted metabolomics.
Our work has focused on defining the utility of fluorine (19F)-labeled bile acid analogues and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify altered bile acid transport in vivo. In the current study, we explored the ability of this approach to differentiate fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15)-deficient from wild-type (WT) mice, a potential diagnostic test for bile acid diarrhea, a commonly misdiagnosed disorder. FGF15 is the murine homologue of human FGF19, an intestinal hormone whose deficiency is an underappreciated cause of bile acid diarrhea. In a pilot and three subsequent pharmacokinetic studies, we treated mice with two 19F-labeled bile acid analogues, CA-lys-TFA and CA-sar-TFMA. After oral dosing, we quantified 19F-labeled bile acid analogue levels in the gallbladder, liver, small and large intestine, and plasma using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Both 19F bile acid analogues concentrated in the gallbladders of FGF15-deficient and WT mice, attaining peak concentrations at approximately 8.5 h after oral dosing. However, analogue levels in gallbladders of FGF15-deficient mice were several-fold less compared to those in WT mice. Live-animal 19F MRI provided agreement with our LC-MS/MS-based measures; we detected robust CA-lys-TFA 19F signals in gallbladders of WT mice but no signals in FGF15-deficient mice. Our finding that 19F MRI differentiates FGF15-deficient from WT mice provides additional proof-of-concept for the development of 19F bile acid analogues and 19F MRI as a clinical test to diagnose bile acid diarrhea due to FGF19 deficiency and other disorders.
This work performed a large scale assessment for organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) degradation activity of 121 Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum strains. Six L. plantarum strains (P9, IMAU80110, IMAU40100, IMAU10585, IMAU10209, and IMAU80070) were found to possess high capacity of degrading three commonly used OPPs, namely dimethoate, phorate, and omethoate; and they were selected for more detailed characterization. Moreover, the three OPPs were mainly detected in the culture supernatants but not in the cell extracts, further confirming that the OPPs were degraded rather than absorbed by the cells. Among the six selected strains, P9 was most tolerant to gastrointestinal juices and bile. We thus used ultra-high performance liquid chromatography electron spray ionization coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-Q-TOF/MS) to generate the metabolomic profiles of the strain P9 growing in MRS medium with and without containing phorate. By using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, we identified some potential phorate-derived degradative products. This work has identified novel lactic acid bacteria resources for application in pesticide degradation. Our results also shed light on the phorate degradation mechanism by L. plantarum P9.
Enterococcus faecalis is a common commensal bacterium in animal gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and a leading cause of opportunistic infections of humans in the modern health care setting. E. faecalis OG1RF is a plasmid-free strain that contains few mobile elements yet retains the robust survival characteristics, intrinsic antibiotic resistance, and virulence traits characteristic of most E. faecalis genotypes. To facilitate interrogation of the core enterococcal genetic determinants for competitive fitness in the GI tract, biofilm formation, intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, and survival in the environment, we generated an arrayed, sequence-defined set of chromosomal transposon insertions in OG1RF. We used an orthogonal pooling strategy in conjunction with Illumina sequencing to identify a set of mutants with unique, single Himar-based transposon insertions. The mutants contained insertions in 1,926 of 2,651 (72.6%) annotated open reading frames and in the majority of hypothetical protein-encoding genes and intergenic regions greater than 100 bp in length, which could encode small RNAs. As proof of principle of the usefulness of this arrayed transposon library, we created a minimal input pool containing 6,829 mutants chosen for maximal genomic coverage and used an approach that we term SMarT (sequence-defined mariner technology) transposon sequencing (TnSeq) to identify numerous genetic determinants of bile resistance in E. faecalis OG1RF. These included several genes previously associated with bile acid resistance as well as new loci. Our arrayed library allows functional screening of a large percentage of the genome with a relatively small number of mutants, reducing potential effects of bottlenecking, and enables immediate recovery of mutants following competitions. IMPORTANCE The robust ability of Enterococcus faecalis to survive outside the host and to spread via oral-fecal transmission and its high degree of intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance all complicate the treatment of hospital-acquired enterococcal infections. The conserved E. faecalis core genome serves as an important genetic scaffold for evolution of this bacterium in the modern health care setting and also provides interesting vaccine and drug targets. We used an innovative pooling/sequencing strategy to map a large collection of arrayed transposon insertions in E. faecalis OG1RF and generated an arrayed library of defined mutants covering approximately 70% of the OG1RF genome. Then, we performed high-throughput transposon sequencing experiments using this library to determine core genomic determinants of bile resistance in OG1RF. This collection is a valuable resource for comprehensive, functional enterococcal genomics using both traditional and high-throughput approaches and enables immediate recovery of mutants of interest.
A simple, safe, targeted, and efficient in vivo DNA delivery system is necessary for clinical-grade liver-targeted gene therapy in humans. Intravascular hydrodynamic gene delivery has been investigated in large animal models, but translation to humans has been hampered by its technical challenges, invasiveness, and potential for significant cardiovascular adverse events. We posited that intrabiliary delivery of DNA plasmids via ERCP-guided hydrodynamic injection could overcome these obstacles.
Twelve pigs (40-50 kg) were divided into 3 groups (4 per group) and survived 21, 30, or 60 days. ERCP was performed by inflating a balloon catheter in the common hepatic duct and creating a closed space between it and the liver parenchyma. Last, a solution composed of plasmid/sleeping beauty (SB) mix was injected under pressure through the catheter into the closed space. Swine were killed at the 3 different time points and liver tissue harvested. Plasmid DNA expression and functional translated protein expression were assessed.
ERCP-guided hydrodynamic delivery of naked plasmid DNA facilitated by pCytomegalovirus-Sleep Beauty (pCMV-SB) transposons was technically feasible and devoid of cardiovascular and local adverse events in all 12 pigs. Furthermore, plasmid DNA (both single and combination) was successfully transferred into swine hepatocytes in all 12 pigs. Additionally, stable integration of the DNA constructs in hepatocyte genomic DNA was reliably noted at all 3 time points. In the 4 swine that were kept alive to 60 days, successful genomic integration and subsequent protein expression was observed in the targeted liver tissue.
ERCP-guided hydrodynamic delivery of gene therapy may usher in the next chapter in gene therapy with the potential to impact a variety of single-gene, complex genetic, and epigenetic liver diseases. It also raises the possibility that other nucleic acid therapeutics (microRNA, lncRNA, siRNA, shRNA) could similarly be delivered.
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a progressive metabolic leukodystrophy. Early identification and treatment from birth onward effectively provides a functional cure, but diagnosis is often delayed. We conducted a pilot study using a two-tier test for CTX to screen archived newborn dried bloodspots (DBSs) or samples collected prospectively from a high-risk Israeli newborn population. All DBS samples were analyzed with flow injection analysis (FIA)-MS/MS, and 5% of samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Consecutively collected samples were analyzed to identify CTX-causing founder genetic variants common among Druze and Moroccan Jewish populations. First-tier analysis with FIA-MS/MS provided 100% sensitivity to detect CTX-positive newborn DBSs, with a low false-positive rate (0.1-0.5%). LC-MS/MS, as a second-tier test, provided 100% sensitivity to detect CTX-positive newborn DBSs with a false-positive rate of 0% (100% specificity). In addition, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α,25-tetrol-3-O-β-D-glucuronide was identified as the predominant bile-alcohol disease marker present in CTX-positive newborn DBSs. In newborns identifying as Druze, a 1:30 carriership frequency was determined for the c.355delC CYP27A1 gene variant, providing an estimated disease prevalence of 1:3,600 in this population. These data support the feasibility of two-tier DBS screening for CTX in newborns and set the stage for large-scale prospective pilot studies.
Bile acid malabsorption (BAM) is a common cause of diarrhoea in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with ileal resection. BAM is usually diagnosed by selenium-labelled homotaurocholic acid test (75SeHCAT) but its availability is limited. Consequently, a large proportion of patients either remain undiagnosed or subject to empirical therapy. There is a paucity of studies examining the correlation between length of ileal resection and severity of BAM, which will be of use to clinicians with no recourse to diagnostic testing for BAM.
We tested the correlation between length of resected ileum and percentage retention on 75SeHCAT of all CD patients with a prior surgical resection who underwent 75SeHCAT testing. Response to treatment with bile salt sequestrant and 75SeHCAT retention values was tested using Fisher's exact test.
A total of 91 patients were identified with a median age of 47 (IQR 21-80). The median length of resected ileum was 24 cm (range 15-165 cm) with a median of 1 resection (range 1-4). Overall, 88 patients (97%) had 75SeHCAT retention values of &lt; 10% and 85 (93%) had retention of &lt; 5%. There was a modest correlation between 75SeHCAT retention and length of ileal resection (Spearman's rho - 0.392, P = 0.0001). Data on response to treatment was available for 57 (63%) patients, of who 38 (67%) responded to bile salt sequestrant. There was no difference in 75SeHCAT retention values between responders and non-responders.
There was a modest correlation between length of ileal resection and severity of BAM as defined by 75SeHCAT retention values. Response to bile salt sequestrant therapy was not dependent on 75SeHCAT retention values.
The metabolic fate of the human hepatotoxin fenclozic acid ([2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid) (Myalex) was studied in normal and bile-cannulated chimeric mice with a humanized liver, following oral administration of 10 mg/kg. This in vivo animal model was investigated to assess its utility to study "human" metabolism of fenclozic acid, and in particular to explore the formation of electrophilic reactive metabolites (RMs), potentially unique to humans. Metabolism was extensive, particularly involving the carboxylic acid-containing side chain. Metabolism resulted in the formation of a large number of metabolites and involved biotransformation via both oxidative and conjugative routes. The oxidative metabolites detected included a variety of hydroxylations as well as cysteinyl-, N-acetylcysteinyl-, and cysteinylglycine metabolites. The latter resulted from the formation of glutathione adducts/conjugates providing evidence for the production of RMs. The production of other classes of RMs included acyl-glucuronides, and the biosynthesis of acyl carnitine, taurine, glutamine, and glycine conjugates via potentially reactive acyl-CoA intermediates was also demonstrated. A number of unique "human" metabolites, e.g., those providing evidence for side-chain extension, were detected in the plasma and excreta of the chimeric liver-humanized mice that were not previously characterised in, e.g., the excreta of rat and C57BL/6 mice. The different pattern of metabolism seen in these chimeric mice with a humanized liver compared to the conventional rodents may offer clues to the factors that contributed to the drug-induced liver injury seen in humans.
Rationale: The liver is a central organ not only for metabolism but also immune function. Life-threatening infections of both bacterial and fungal origin can affect liver function but it is yet unknown whether molecular changes differ depending on the pathogen. We aimed to determine whether the hepatic host response to bacterial and fungal infections differs in terms of hepatic metabolism and liver function. Methods: We compared murine models of infection, including bacterial peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI), intraperitoneal and systemic C. albicans infection, at 6 and 24 h post-infection, to sham controls. The molecular hepatic host response was investigated by the detection of regulatory modules based on large-scale protein-protein interaction networks and expression data. Topological analysis of these regulatory modules was used to reveal infection-specific biological processes and molecular mechanisms. Intravital microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to further analyze specific aspects of pathophysiology such as cholestasis. Results: Down-regulation of lipid catabolism and bile acid synthesis was observed after 6 h in all infection groups. Alterations in lipid catabolism were characterized by accumulation of long chain acylcarnitines and defective beta-oxidation, which affected metabolism by 6 h. While PCI led to an accumulation of unconjugated bile acids (BA), C. albicans infection caused accumulation of conjugated BA independent of the route of infection. Hepatic dye clearance and transporter expression revealed reduced hepatic uptake in fungal infections vs. defects in secretion following polybacterial infection. Conclusion: Molecular phenotypes of lipid accumulation and cholestasis allow differentiation between pathogens as well as routes of infection at early stages in mice. Targeted metabolomics could be a useful tool for the profiling of infected/septic patients and the type of pathogen, with subsequent customization and targeting of therapy.
A static in vitro model was used to assess walnuts and peanuts macronutrient digestion of with two different particle size. Nuts were digested under different intestinal conditions of pH (6 or 7), bile concentration (1-10 mM) and pancreatic concentration (1000 to 4000 LU/g fat) the matrix degradation index (MDI), proteolysis and lipolysis were analyzed. Results showed that nuts particle size affects proteolysis and MDI the most; intestinal pH was more relevant in free fatty acids release. Lipolysis extent was lower under suboptimal intestinal conditions of pH 6 and bile salts 1 mM, and in peanuts it was lower than walnuts (567, 585, 134 and 398 mg FFA/g fat in large and small walnuts, and large and small peanuts, respectively). The higher the pancreatic concentration the higher the proteolysis extent in walnuts; in peanuts, protein digestibility was limited even at high pancreatic concentration at pH 6 and bile concentration 1 mM.
Millions of people worldwide have a chronic infection with the liver fluke Opisthorchis felineus, which causes opisthorchiasis in humans and animals. The only known effective drug for this disease is praziquantel (PrzQ); however, its efficacy is below 100%, and it has some adverse effects. In this study, a water-soluble complex of PrzQ with a disodium salt of glycyrrhizic acid (disodium glycyrrhizinate; Na2GA) in a 1:10 ratio (PrzQ:GA) allowed the PrzQ dose to be decreased 11-fold for effective killing of O. felineus. An in vitro experiment showed a sufficient anthelmintic efficiency of PrzQ:GA against both adult and juvenile O. felineus individuals. A Syrian golden hamster model of opisthorchiasis revealed a considerable anthelmintic effect at all tested PrzQ:GA doses (50, 100, 200, 400, and 1100 mg/kg) with the best performance at 400 and 1100 mg/kg. Further comparison of the effects of PrzQ (400 mg/kg) and PrzQ:GA (400 mg/kg) regarding the state of the host indicated significant advantages of the latter. Histological examination showed that PrzQ:GA was better at decreasing the O. felineus-induced inflammatory infiltration (as compared with PrzQ alone) as well as interfered with the development of epithelial dysplasia and metaplasia in large bile ducts and cholangiofibrosis. Both PrzQ and PrzQ:GA decreased the number of myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E + CFU-E) colonies induced by O. felineus infection. The drugs had no negative effect on the animal behavior in an open field test 2-4 h after administration. Thus, PrzQ:GA proved to be a good anthelmintic agent having no evident adverse effects on the host, thereby suggesting that further preclinical and clinical trials would be warranted.
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is typically associated with elevated serum bile acid levels and pruritus, but pruritus is often refractory to treatment with existing therapies. This phase 2 study assessed the efficacy and safety of maralixibat, a selective, ileal, apical, sodium-dependent, bile acid transporter inhibitor, in adults with PBC and pruritus. Adults with PBC and pruritus who had received ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for ≥6 months or were intolerant to UDCA were randomized 2:1 to maralixibat (10 or 20 mg/day) or placebo for 13 weeks in combination with UDCA (when tolerated). The primary outcome was change in Adult Itch Reported Outcome (ItchRO™) average weekly sum score (0, no itching; 70, maximum itching) from baseline to week 13/early termination (ET). The study enrolled 66 patients (maralixibat [both doses combined], n = 42; placebo, n = 24). Mean ItchRO™ weekly sum scores decreased from baseline to week 13/ET with maralixibat (-26.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], -31.8, -21.2) and placebo (-23.4; 95% CI, -30.3, -16.4). The difference between groups was not significant (P = 0.48). In the maralixibat and placebo groups, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 97.6% and 70.8% of patients, respectively. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (maralixibat, 78.6%; placebo, 50.0%). Conclusion: Reductions in pruritus did not differ significantly between maralixibat and placebo. However, a large placebo effect may have confounded assessment of pruritus. Lessons learned from this rigorously designed and executed trial are indispensable for understanding how to approach trials assessing pruritus as the primary endpoint and the therapeutic window of bile acid uptake inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in PBC.
To report on the use of percutaneous hydrochloric acid (HCl) enhanced radiofrequency ablation (HRFA) for the treatment of large (maximum diameter ≥ 5 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the caudate lobe.
Between August 2013 and June 2016, three patients with a large HCC (maximum diameter: 5.0, 5.7, and 8.1 cm) in the caudate lobe were treated by transarterial chemoembolization followed by computer tomography (CT) guided RFA using a monopolar perfusion RF electrode, which was enhanced by local infusion of 10% HCl at 0.2 mL/min (total volume, 3 to 12 mL). The output power of HRFA reached 100 W, and the average ablation time was 39 min (range, 15 to 60 min). Two patients each underwent one session of HRFA and one patient two sessions. After treatment, CT/magnetic resonance imaging showed that all the three lesions were completely ablated. There was no major complication. Two patients had asymptomatic bile duct dilatation. One patient died of tongue cancer 24 mo after ablation. The remaining two patients were alive and no area of enhancement is detected in the caudate lobe at 28 and 60 mo after ablation, respectively.
Percutaneous CT-guided HRFA is safe and efficacious in treating large HCC in the caudate lobe.
Ingestion of a high-fat (HF) diet is known to enhance bile acid (BA) secretion, but precise information about the BA molecular species is lacking, especially information on the conjugated BAs in enterohepatic circulation. As cholesterol is the precursor of BAs, we analyzed alterations of the entire BA metabolic pathway in response to a HF diet without the addition of cholesterol and BA in the diet. Additionally, we evaluated the relationships between BA metabolism and some disorders, such as plasma transaminase activities and glucose intolerance induced by the HF diet. Acclimated WKAH/HkmSlc male rats (3 wk old) were divided into two groups fed a control or the HF diet for 22 wk. Fasting blood glucose was measured during the experimental period, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed at week 21. As a result, ingestion of the HF diet selectively increased the concentration of taurocholic acid in the bile and small intestinal contents as well as deoxycholic acid in the large intestinal contents and feces. These results indicated a selective increase of 12α-hydroxylated BA concentrations in response to the HF diet. Moreover, fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA concentration was positively correlated with cumulative energy intake, visceral adipose tissue weight, and glucose intolerance. The present study suggests that fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA is a non-invasive marker that can detect the early phase of glucose intolerance.
Rat gastroduodenal reflux models have been used for analyzing Barrett's carcinogenesis. Mice seem to be more useful than rats for studies targeting genes.
We induced gastroduodenal contents reflux by esophagojejunostomy using C57BL/6J mice. Mice were divided into a standard diet and high-fat diet groups and kept for 60 weeks. Bile was sampled from the gallbladder to analyze bile acid fractions, and the esophagus was removed for a histological investigation. Human esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma cells (OE19) were exposed to taurocholic acid (TCA), after which cell proliferative activity was measured. Rat esophageal cancer cell lines, ESCC-DR and ESCC-DRtca with higher malignant potential induced by continuous TCA exposure, were used to perform comprehensive genetic analysis (CGH).
Barrett's epithelium onset occurred in all mice, and no differences in histological changes were noted between the standard diet and high-fat diet groups. However, no development of adenocarcinoma was noted. Most of the mouse bile acid was taurine conjugates. In the experiment using OE-19 cells, TCA promotes cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Array CGH analysis revealed a large number of chromosomal abnormalities in the ESCC-DR, in addition to genetic abnormalities such as in the UGT2B gene, the substrate of which is bile acid. TCA administration resulted in more chromosomal abnormalities being detected.
We showed the effects of TCA in cancer progression in vitro. However, Barrett's adenocarcinoma onset rates differ between mice and rats despite undergoing similar reflux stimulation including taurine-conjugated bile acids being detected in mouse bile juice. These results suggest that host factors seem to influence Barrett's carcinogenesis.
Given that obesity and associated disorder type II diabetes mellitus have reached epidemic proportions worldwide, the development of efficient prevention and therapeutic interventions is a global public health interest. There is now a large body of evidence suggesting that the micro-organisms colonizing the human gut, known as gut microbiota, play a central role in human physiology and metabolism. Understanding how gut microbiota affects and regulates key metabolic functions such as glucose regulation and insulin resistance is an important health issue. The present review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of how gut bacterial species interfere with host metabolic phenotype. We will examine key biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut microbiota on host glycemic control including: incretin secretion, short-chain fatty acid production, bile acid metabolism, and adipose tissue regulation. We will highlight how prebiotic/probiotic interventions affect these bacterial processes and are now considered as promising approaches to treat obese and diabetic patients.
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) was the first strain belonging to the genus Lactobacillus to be patented in 1989 thanks to its ability to survive and to proliferate at gastric acid pH and in medium containing bile, and to adhere to enterocytes. Furthermore LGG is able to produces both a biofilm that can mechanically protect the mucosa, and different soluble factors beneficial to the gut by enhancing intestinal crypt survival, diminishing apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium, and preserving cytoskeletal integrity. Moreover LGG thanks to its lectin-like protein 1 and 2 inhibits some pathogens such as Salmonella species. Finally LGG is able to promote type 1 immune-responsiveness by reducing the expression of several activation and inflammation markers on monocytes and by increasing the production of interleukin-10, interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor-α in macrophages. A large number of research data on Lactobacillus GG is the basis for the use of this probiotic for human health. In this review we have considered predominantly randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, Cochrane Review, guide lines of Scientific Societies and anyway studies whose results were evaluated by means of relative risk, odds ratio, weighted mean difference 95% confidence interval. The effectiveness of LGG in gastrointestinal infections and diarrhea, antibiotic and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, respiratory tract infections, allergy, cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cystic fibrosis, cancer, elderly end sport were analyzed.
Bear bile powder is a valuable medicinal material characterized by high content of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) at a certain ratio to taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA). We had created an engineered E. coli harboring two-step bidirectional oxidative and reductive enzyme-catalyzing pathway that could rapidly convert TCDCA to TUDCA at a specific percentage in shake flasks.
We reported here the large-scale production of TUDCA containing products by balancing the bidirectional reactions through optimizing fermentation process of the engineered E. coli in fermenters. The fermentation medium was firstly optimized based on M9 medium using response surface methodology, leading to a glycerol and yeast extract modified M9-GY medium benefits for both cell growth and product conversion efficiency. Then isopropylthio-β-galactoside induction and fed-stock stage was successively optimized. Finally, a special deep-tank static process was developed to promote the conversion from TCDCA to TUDCA. Applying the optimal condition, fermentation was performed by separately supplementing 30 g refined chicken bile powder and 35 g crude chicken bile powder as substrates, resulting in 29.35 ± 2.83 g and 30.78 ± 3.04 g powder products containing 35.85 ± 3.85% and 27.14 ± 4.23% of TUDCA at a ratio of 1.49 ± 0.14 and 1.55 ± 0.19 to TCDCA, respectively, after purification and evaporation of the fermentation broth. The recovery yield was 92.84 ± 4.21% and 91.83 ± 2.56%, respectively.
This study provided a practical and environment friendly industrialized process for producing artificial substitute of bear bile powder from cheap and readily available chicken bile powder using engineered E. coli microbial cell factory. It also put forward an interesting deep-tank static process to promote the enzyme-catalyzing reactions toward target compounds in synthetic biology-based fermentation.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of paediatric liver disease, affecting 10% of school-aged children and 44-70% of obese children and young people (CYP) in the western world. Encompassing a spectrum from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and progressive fibrosis, the disease is rapidly becoming the most common indication for liver transplantation. The molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD remains only partially understood. Development and progression of NAFLD is influenced by genetic and nutritional factors, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, gut microbiome, bile acid metabolism and lipid/glucose handling and is closely associated with overweight and obesity. Lifestyle change is the only proven effective treatment for paediatric NAFLD, however this is difficult to achieve in many. Given that moderate or severe fibrosis is already present in 30-50% of children with NAFLD at the time of presentation, progression in CYP may be more rapid, though adequate outcome data do not yet exist in this cohort. CYP with NAFLD are an excellent population in which to study underlying mechanisms and interventions to correct disease progression as they are largely unaffected by other environmental influences such as alcohol and may represent the more severe end of the spectrum in terms of early onset. Undoubtedly genetic and epigenetic mechanisms determine a large proportion of susceptibility to the disease and potentially, identification of individuals at risk may allow for targeted therapy. This review with give a clinical perspective of paediatric NAFLD focused on identifying those at risk of progressive disease and what to consider in attempting to modify risk.
In patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), anti-reflux surgery aims to sustainable control reflux symptoms and heal reflux induced esophageal mucosal inflammation and prevent progression of BE to adenocarcinoma. There is growing evidence that beside gastric acid, bile salts in refluxed duodenal juice are responsible for the development and progression of BE. However, the pathogenesis of BE progression and the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence of the adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (EAC) is multifactorial and occurs over long natural time course. After anti-reflux surgery significant levels of regression from metaplastic Barrett's to non-metaplastic epithelium as well as from dysplastic to non-dysplastic BE have been observed and a randomized trial showed that sufficient surgical reflux control reduces the risk of Barrett's progression significantly when compared to medical treatment. Thus, large cohort studies show significant reduced risk of EAC in patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with and without BE after anti-reflux surgery. Even after anti-reflux surgery the risk for EAC remains elevated in patients with BE and the right moment of intercepting the progressive nature of GERD has to be discussed in future. The paper also addresses the impact of anti-reflux surgery, endoscopic ablation and life style therapies for the management of GERD, BE and cancer prevention.
We assessed adverse effects of external sublethal exposure of Deepwater Horizon, Mississippi Canyon 252 oil on plasma and liver metabolome profiles of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), a large (1.5 to 3.0 kg) diving waterbird common in the Gulf of Mexico. Metabolomics analysis of avian plasma showed significant negative effects on avian metabolic profiles, in some cases after only two external exposures (26 g cumulative) to oil. We observed significant (p &lt; 0.05) changes in intermediate metabolites of energy metabolism and fatty acid and amino acid metabolic pathways in cormorants after repeated exposure to oil. Exposure to oil increased several metabolites (glycine, betaine, serine and methionine) that are essential to the one-carbon metabolism pathway. Lipid metabolism was affected, causing an increase in production of ketone bodies, suggesting lipids were used as an alternative energy source for energy production in oil exposed birds. In addition, metabolites associated with hepatic bile acid metabolism were affected by oil exposure which was correlated with changes observed in bile acids in exposed birds. These changes at the most basic level of phenotypic expression caused by sublethal exposure to oil can have effects that would be detrimental to reproduction, migration, and survival in avian species.
The roots of Gynura japonica are used as traditional medicine for treating blood stasis or traumatic injury even though hundreds of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome cases have been reported after consumption of the roots, which contain large amounts of hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (HPAs). However, no information is available about the toxic compounds in the aerial parts of G. japonica, which are also used as herbal medicines and even vegetables in several areas. Thus, the toxic chemicals in the aerial parts of G. japonica, i.e., HPAs, must be urgently identified.
In this study, we aimed to 1) identify the toxic compounds in different medicinal parts and 2) examine the hepatotoxicity of G. japonica.
A total of 35 batches of the roots and aerial parts of G. japonica were collected from different sources and analyzed for HPAs. The hepatotoxicity of different extracts (i.e., total extracts [TE] and total alkaloids [TA]) and a single compound (i.e., senecionine) was evaluated on mice.
Qualitative analysis of HPAs was performed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-parent ion scan approach, whereas a quantitative assay was performed by a UPLC-MS-selected ion monitoring approach. Male C57BL mice were orally administered the different extracts or the single compound at dosages equivalent to 50  mg HPAs/kg body weight. The sera and the livers were collected at 48  h after treatment and used to evaluate the hepatotoxicity through serum clinical biomarkers assay, liver histology, and bile acid profiling.
A total of 21 HPAs were identified in the roots and the aerial parts. The roots contained higher levels of HPAs (4.90  mg/g) than did the aerial parts (2.21 mg/g). TE and TA induced similar acute liver injuries, but senecionine was considerably more toxic than these extracts. Mice treated with TE showed significantly impaired bile acid homeostasis in the sera and the livers.
The roots and aerial parts of G. japonica contained large amounts of HPAs, including senecionine, which were responsible for the hepatotoxicity of G. japonica. Bile acid homeostasis was uniquely impaired after exposure to the plant. Therefore, neither the roots nor the aerial parts of G. japonica should be consumed as medicines or vegetables.
The goal of this study was to establish reference intervals for blood parameters in rabbits based on data from routine diagnostic samples.

Drug-induced cholestasis is mostly intrahepatic and characterized by alterations of bile canaliculi dynamics and morphology as well as accumulation of bile acids (BAs) in hepatocytes. However, little information exists on first changes in BA content and profile induced by cholestatic drugs in human liver. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effects of a large set of cholestatic and noncholestatic drugs in presence of physiological serum concentrations and 60-fold higher levels of 9 main BAs on cellular accumulation of BAs using HepaRG hepatocytes. BAs were measured in cell layers (cells + bile canaliculi) and culture media using high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry after 24 h-treatment. Comparable changes in total and individual BA levels were observed in cell layers and media from control and noncholestatic drug-treated cultures: unconjugated BAs were actively amidated and lithocholic acid (LCA) was entirely sulfated. In contrast, cellular accumulation of LCA and in addition, of the 2 other hydrophobic BAs, chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid, was evidenced only with cholestatic compounds in presence of BA mixtures at normal and 60-fold serum levels, respectively, suggesting that LCA was the first BA to accumulate. Cellular accumulation of hydrophobic BAs was associated with inhibition of their amidation and for LCA, its sulfation. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that cellular accumulation of unconjugated hydrophobic BAs can be caused by various cholestatic drugs in human hepatocytes and suggest that their cellular detection, especially that of LCA, could represent a new strategy for evaluation of cholestatic potential of drugs and other chemicals.
Thylakoid-rich spinach extract is being used as dietary weight-loss supplements in Japan. A recent rat study has suggested that intake of thylakoid-rich spinach extract with dietary oil inhibits dietary fat absorption via binding to bile acids, which promotes excretion of bile acids in feces. While, we confirmed that a serving size of thylakoid-rich spinach extract contains a large amount of calcium (130 mg/5 g). Therefore, using rats, we evaluated whether one-time ingestion of thylakoid-rich spinach extract affects the gastrointestinal absorption of water-insoluble drugs, such as griseofulvin (GF) and indomethacin (IM), or ciprofloxacin (CPFX) that chelate with polyvalent metal cations. Pretreatment of the rats with thylakoid-rich spinach extract (100 or 300 mg/kg) for 15 min prior to oral administration of GF (50 mg/kg) or IM (10 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic properties of either drug. Meanwhile, co-administration of thylakoid-rich spinach extract (500 mg/kg) and CPFX (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced the peak plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of CPFX to 25 and 40%, respectively in rats. In vitro studies demonstrated that when a mixture of thylakoid-rich spinach extract and CPFX was centrifuged, there was a significant reduction in the supernatant concentration of CPFX relative to the control. When the experiment was repeated in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, the concentration of CPFX was unchanged. These results suggest that the intake of thylakoid-rich spinach extract may reduce the absorption of drugs that form a chelate with polyvalent metal cations, such as CPFX.
The human gut hosts trillions of microorganisms that exert a profound influence on human biology. Gut bacteria communicate with their host by secreting small molecules that can signal to distant organs in the body. Bile acids are one class of these signaling molecules, synthesized by the host and chemically transformed by the gut microbiota. Among bile acid metabolizers, bile acid 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids. The latter represents a major fraction of the secondary bile acid pool. The microbiology of this group of gut microorganisms is understudied and warrants more attention. Here, we detail the bile acid transformations carried out by the 7-dehydroxylating bacterium Clostridium scindens in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, C. scindens exhibits not only 7α-dehydroxylating capabilities but also, the ability to oxidize other hydroxyl groups and reduce ketone groups in primary and secondary bile acids. This study revealed 12-oxolithocholic acid as a major transient product in the 7α-dehydroxylation of cholic acid. Furthermore, the in vivo study included complementing a gnotobiotic mouse line (devoid of the ability to 7-dehydroxylate bile acids) with C. scindens and investigating its colonization dynamics and bile acid transformations. Using NanoSIMS (Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry), we demonstrate that the large intestine constitutes a niche for C. scindens, where it efficiently 7-dehydroxylates cholic acid to deoxycholic acid. Overall, this work reveals a novel transient species during 7-dehydroxylation as well as provides direct evidence for the colonization and growth of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria in the large intestine.
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can induce remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In a randomized controlled trial of FMT in patients with active UC, we aimed to identify bacterial taxonomic and functional factors associated with response to therapy.
We performed a double-blind trial of 81 patients with active UC randomly assigned to groups that received an initial colonoscopic infusion and then intensive multidonor FMT or placebo enemas, 5 d/wk for 8 weeks. Patients in the FMT group received blended homogenized stool from 3-7 unrelated donors. Patients in the placebo group were eligible to receive open-label FMT after the double-blind study period. We collected 314 fecal samples from the patients at screening, every 4 weeks during treatment, and 8 weeks after the blinded or open-label FMT therapy. We also collected 160 large-bowel biopsy samples from the patients at study entry, at completion of 8 weeks of blinded therapy, and at the end of open-label FMT, if applicable. We analyzed 105 fecal samples from the 14 individual donors (n = 55), who in turn contributed to 21 multidonor batches (n = 50). Bacteria in colonic and fecal samples were analyzed by both 16S ribosomal RNA gene and transcript amplicon sequencing; 285 fecal samples were analyzed by shotgun metagenomics, and 60 fecal samples were analyzed for metabolome features.
FMT increased microbial diversity and altered composition, based on analyses of colon and fecal samples collected before vs after FMT. Diversity was greater in fecal and colon samples collected before and after FMT treatment from patients who achieved remission compared with patients who did not. Patients in remission after FMT had enrichment of Eubacterium hallii and Roseburia inulivorans compared with patients who did not achieve remission after FMT and had increased levels of short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and secondary bile acids. Patients who did not achieve remission had enrichment of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Sutterella wadsworthensis, and Escherichia species and increased levels of heme and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Bacteroides in donor stool were associated with remission in patients receiving FMT, and Streptococcus species in donor stool was associated with no response to FMT.
In an analysis of fecal and colonic mucosa samples from patients receiving FMT for active UC and stool samples from donors, we associated specific bacteria and metabolic pathways with induction of remission. These findings may be of value in the design of microbe-based therapies for UC. ClinicalTrials.gov, Number NCT01896635.
This study aimed to analyze the change of death/liver transplantation hazard and biochemical indexes over time after Kasai procedure (KP) based on a retrospective biliary atresia (BA) cohort, and to evaluate the predictive value of early jaundice clearance rate to 5-year native liver survival (NLS).
A retrospective cohort with follow-up results of 139 BA patients from January 2009 to December 2012 was established, and the pre- and postoperative data were collected. NLS rates were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves, and any differences between groups were tested by log-rank test. Hazard curve of death/liver transplantation was fitted with Weibull distribution, and hazards at certain time points were calculated. Trend charts of biochemical indexes were drawn to show any changes over time. Rate of jaundice clearance was indicated as the proportion of decreased total bilirubin level at a certain postoperative time point to preoperative total bilirubin level. In multivariate analysis for prediction of 5-year NLS, COX proportional hazard regression model was used and results were expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The predictive value of early jaundice clearance rates for 5-year NLS was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and a cut-off value of 4-week jaundice clearance rate was determined.
The estimated 5-year NLS rate of the 139 patients was 58.0%. The patients had a high hazard of death/liver transplantation early after KP, which gradually decreased and stabilized at a lower level 1 year later. Most death/liver transplantation events occurred within 1 year after KP. The total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL) and total bile acid (TBA) levels of successful Kasai group decreased continuously after KP, and the biggest decline was seen in the first month. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels increased during the first month after KP and decreased continuously thereafter. All the biochemical indexes of successful Kasai group tended to stabilize within/close to normal range 1 year after KP. On the contrary, all the biochemical indexes of failed Kasai group fluctuated at obvious abnormal levels after KP. The estimated 5-year NLS rates of successful Kasai group and failed Kasai group were 90.1% and 10.7% (p = 0.000). The most significant clinical protective factor of 5-year NLS was 4-week jaundice clearance rate, revealed by COX proportional hazard regression model, and the HR was 0.089 (95%CI 0.018-0.432, p = 0.003). In predicting 5-year native liver survival, the largest area under ROC (AUROC) curve belonged to 4-week jaundice clearance rate, which was 0.731 (p = 0.000). A cut-off value of 0.457 was determined, with sensitivity 0.827, specificity 0.552, positive predictive value 0.720, and negative predictive value 0.696. NLS rates of patients divided by cut-off value showed significant statistical difference demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test (p = 0.000).
The 5-year death/liver transplantation hazard of biliary atresia patients reduces greatly and stabilizes 1 year after KP. A successful KP enables patients to achieve long-term stable normal biochemical indexes. A rapid clearance of jaundice is of great positive significance to 5-year NLS, and the 4-week jaundice clearance rate is of some predictive value.
Prognosis study.
Level II, retrospective study.
Polyfluoroalkyl phosphates esters (PAPs) are widely used in a variety of commercial products, and have been detected in many aquatic organisms. In this study, common carps (Cyprinus carpio) were administered with 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP in water to investigate their bio-accumulation and transformation in fish. Several degradation products, including fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids (6:2 and 8:2 FTUCA), 5:3 and 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (5:3 and 7:3 FTCA), perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) were identified in the carp liver. In addition, several phase-II metabolites, such as glutathione- and glucuronide-conjugated compounds were detected in the carp bile. 8:2 diPAP displayed lower accumulation potential than 6:2 diPAP probably due to its relatively large molecular size. However, 8:2 diPAP experienced more extensive transformation (transformation rate 6.78-14.6 mol%) and produced more phase I metabolites than 6:2 diPAP (0.49-0.66 mol%). The in vitro incubation with the liver S9 fraction confirmed that biotransformation of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP took place in the carp liver. Further analyses of enzyme activities indicated that acid phosphatase (ACP) could be involved in mediating phase I while glutathione S-transferase (GST) involved in phase II metabolism of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAP in carp.
The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as a second genome that contributes to the health and diseases of the host. A major function of the gut microbiota is to convert primary bile acids (BAs) produced from cholesterol in the liver into secondary BAs that activate distinct host receptors to modulate xenobiotic metabolism and energy homeostasis. The goal of this study was to investigate to what extent oral exposure to an environmentally relevant polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs mixture), namely the Fox River mixture, impacts gut microbiome and BA homeostasis. Ninety-day-old adult female conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were orally exposed to corn oil (vehicle), or the Fox River mixture at 6 or 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days. The PCB low dose profoundly increased BA metabolism related bacteria Akkermansia (A.) muciniphila, Clostridium (C.) scindens, and Enterococcus in the large intestinal pellet (LIP) of CV mice (16S rRNA sequencing/qPCR). This correlated with a PCB low dose-mediated increase in multiple BAs in serum and small intestinal content (SIP) in a gut microbiota-dependent manner (UPLC-MS/MS). Conversely, at PCB high dose, BA levels remained stable in CV mice correlated with an increase in hepatic efflux transporters and ileal Fgf15. Interestingly, lack of gut microbiota potentiated the PCB-mediated increase in taurine conjugated α and β muricholic acids in liver, SIP, and LIP. Pearson's correlation identified positive correlations between 5 taxa and most secondary BAs. In conclusion, PCBs dose-dependently altered BA homeostasis through a joint effort between host gut-liver axis and intestinal bacteria.
Acyl-CoA hydrolases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA thioesters to free fatty acids and CoA-SH. The human brain acyl-CoA hydrolase (BACH) gene comprises 13 exons, generating several isoforms through the alternative use of exons. Four first exons (1a-1d) can be used, and three patterns of splicing occur at exon X located between exons 7 and 8 that contains an internal 3(')-splice acceptor site and creates premature stop codons. When examined with green fluorescent protein-fusion constructs expressed in Neuro-2a cells, the nuclear localization signal encoded by exon 9 was functional by itself, whereas the whole structure was cytosolic, suggesting nuclear translocation of the enzyme. This was consistent with dual staining of the cytosol and nucleus in certain neurons by immunohistochemistry using anti-BACH antibody. The mitochondrial targeting signals encoded by exons 1b and 1c were also functional and directed mitochondrial localization of BACH isoforms with the signals. Although BACH mRNA containing the sequence derived from exon 1a, but not exon X, was exclusively expressed in human brain, these results suggest that the human BACH gene can express long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase activity in multiple intracellular compartments by generating BACH isoforms with differential localization signals to affect various cellular functions that involve acyl-CoAs.
Leaves from transgenic Brassica napus L. plants engineered to produce lauric acid show increased levels of enzyme activities of the pathways associated with fatty acid catabolism (V.A. Eccleston and J.B. Ohlrogge, 1998, Plant Cell 10: 613-621). In order to determine if the increases in enzyme activity are mirrored by increases in the expression of genes encoding enzymes of beta-oxidation, which is the major pathway of fatty acid catabolism in plants, the medium-chain acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase MCTE from California bay (Umbellularia california) was over-expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Arabidopsis was the most suitable choice for these studies since gene expression could be analyzed in a large number of independent MCTE-expressing lines using already well-characterized beta-oxidation genes. Levels of MCTE transcripts in leaves varied widely over the population of plants analyzed. Furthermore, active MCTE was produced as determined by enzymatic analysis of leaf extracts of MCTE-expressing plants. These plants incorporated laurate into triacylglycerol of seeds, but not into lipids of leaves as shown by gaschromatographic analysis of total fatty acid extracts. The expression levels of the beta-oxidation and other genes that are highly expressed during developmental stages involving rapid fatty acid degradation were measured. No significant difference in gene expression was observed among MCTE-expressing plants and transgenic and non-transgenic controls. To eliminate the possibility that post-translational mechanisms are responsible for the observed increases in enzyme activity acyl-CoA oxidase activity was also measured in leaves of MCTE-expressing plants using medium and long chain acyl-CoA substrates. No significant increases in either medium- or long-chain acyl-CoA oxidase activities were detected. We conclude that endogenous beta-oxidation is sufficient to account for the complete degradation of laurate produced in rosette leaves of Arabidopsis expressing MCTE.
Escherichia coli thioesterase I (TesA) encoded by the tesA gene is located in the cellular periplasm. The tesA gene was modified by deletion of the leader sequence such that the mature enzyme was instead localized to the cellular cytosol. Production of thioesterase I in the cytosol results in striking changes in the pattern of E. coli lipid synthesis. In contrast to normal E. coli cells, cells producing cytosolic TesA synthesize large amounts of free fatty acid at all stages of growth. Moreover, cultures of the cytosolic TesA-producing strain continue lipid synthesis (as free fatty acid) in stationary phase whereas lipid synthesis is normally strongly inhibited in such cultures. Surprisingly, production of cytosolic thioesterase I gave only modest inhibition of membrane phospholipid synthesis. These results demonstrate that internalization of a normally secreted enzyme can disrupt normal cellular regulatory mechanisms.
We have previously reported the purification of a palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (PPT) from bovine brain that removes palmitate from Ha-Ras (Camp, L. A., and Hofmann, S. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22566-22574). In the current paper, we have isolated bovine and rat cDNA clones encoding PPT. The deduced amino acid sequence of PPT predicts a protein of 306 amino acids that contains amino acid motifs characteristic of thioesterases: "Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly" positioned near the NH2 terminus and "Gly-Asp-His" positioned near the COOH terminus of the protein. The identity of the PPT cDNA was further confirmed by expression in simian COS cells and insect Sf9 cells. Comparison of the DNA and protein sequence data suggests that a hydrophobic NH2-terminal sequence of 27 amino acid residues is removed from the primary translation product. Furthermore, the recombinant protein and the native protein purified from bovine brain contain complex asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and a large proportion of the expressed PPT is secreted from COS and Sf9 cells. Thus, while the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase will deacylate intracellular palmitoylated proteins such as Ha-Ras and the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, the physiologic substrates are likely to be externally oriented or secreted proteins.
We have deduced the nucleotide sequence of the genes encoding the three components of 4-chlorobenzoate (4-CBA) dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. CBS-3 and examined the origin of these proteins by homology analysis. Open reading frame 1 (ORF1) encodes a 30-kDa 4-CBA-coenzyme A dehalogenase related to enoyl-coenzyme A hydratases functioning in fatty acid beta-oxidation. ORF2 encodes a 57-kDa protein which activates 4-CBA by acyl adenylation/thioesterification. This 4-CBA:coenzyme A ligase shares significant sequence similarity with a large group of proteins, many of which catalyze similar chemistry in beta-oxidation pathways or in siderophore and antibiotic synthetic pathways. These proteins have in common a short stretch of sequence, (T,S)(S,G)G(T,S)(T,E)G(L,X)PK(G,-), which is particularly highly conserved and which may represent an important new class of "signature" sequence. We were unable to find any proteins homologous in sequence to the 16-kDa 4-hydroxybenzoate-coenzyme A thioesterase encoded by ORF3. Analysis of the chemistry and function of the proteins found to be structurally related to the 4-CBA:coenzyme A ligase and the 4-CBA-coenzyme A dehalogenase supports the proposal that they evolved from a beta-oxidation pathway.
Frozen rat liver microsomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum were irradiated with high energy electrons. The surviving enzymatic activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and activity for esterification of 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased as a simple exponential function of radiation exposure, leading to a target size of 170-180 kDa. The loss of acyl-CoA hydrolase activity with a radiation dose was complex and resolved as a 45-kDa enzyme associated with a large inhibitor. It is interpreted that acyl-CoA hydrolase is the acyl-CoA-binding component and the inhibitor is the cholesterol-binding component of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase.
It had been shown that plastocyanin and cytochrome c-553 are functionally interchangeable in algae and that the physiological electron transfer reactions are sensitive to ionic strength. The isoelectric points of these proteins range from very acidic to basic depending upon species, and naturally occurring amino acid substitutions of charged residues have been shown to affect the kinetics of electron transfer, presumably through alteration of protein net charge. We have now shown that these naturally occurring amino acid substitutions also affect the kinetics of nonphysiological electron transfer reactions, and that we can quantitate the extent of nonconservation of charge. The reduction of plant and algal proteins by FMN semiquinone is sensitive to ionic strength and the effects can be correlated with net protein charge with regard to sign, but not to magnitude, with the charge at the site of electron transfer varying from +3 through 0 to -3. We had previously observed in a large variety of electron transfer proteins from bacteria (G. Tollin, T. E. Meyer, and M. A. Cusanovich (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 853, 29-41) that charge localized at the site of electron transfer, rather than net protein charge, was more likely to affect kinetics. This also appears to be the case with the algal proteins. By comparison of protein structures, we have been able to predict which substitutions are likely to be responsible for the kinetic effects in the algal proteins and to discuss the implications of such changes for function.
