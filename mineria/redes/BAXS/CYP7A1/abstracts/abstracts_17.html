<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Advancements in microscopy and more recently in neuroendoscopy have revolutionized the field of neurosurgery. Handheld neurosurgical instruments are integral components of these procedures. However, these instruments have many limitations, such as poor ergonomics, constrained maneuverability, and limited degrees of freedom. A need for developing better instruments is commonly felt by neurosurgeons. Also, the focus of modern neurosurgical training is shifting toward simulation models. The baseline data of surgical instruments play a vital role in the development of virtual and physical simulators. A primary factor impeding development of novel instruments and simulators is lack of a comprehensive surgical instrument database. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a virtual repository of microscopic and neuroendoscopic instruments.
Standard neurosurgical instrument sets were scanned, reverse engineered, and stored in various file formats at the file transfer protocol server. The developed database was validated by 4 groups of experts by creating different neurosurgery applications.
Four groups of experts used the repository content to create novel ergonomic instrument designs, e-learning material, computer vision-based surgical skills evaluation and virtual reality and validated the contents. The validation results showed that quality of content (75%), usefulness of content (85.6%), and time saving using content (88.1%) received high scores, and the effectiveness of the virtual repository contents was appreciated.
The virtual database is an efficient starting aid to foster research collaborations related to neurosurgical instruments and surgical simulation platforms.
Tissue-resident CD8+ memory T (TRM) cells are immune cells that permanently reside at tissue sites where they play an important role in providing rapid protection against reinfection. They are not only phenotypically and functionally distinct from their circulating memory counterparts, but also exhibit a unique transcriptional profile. To date, the local tissue signals required for their development and long-term residency are not well understood. So far, the best-characterised tissue-derived signal is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which has been shown to promote the development of these cells within tissues. In this study, we aimed to determine to what extent the transcriptional signatures of TRM cells from multiple tissues reflects TGF-β imprinting. We activated murine CD8+ T cells, stimulated them in vitro by TGF-β, and profiled their transcriptomes using RNA-seq. Upon comparison, we identified a TGF-β-induced signature of differentially expressed genes between TGF-β-stimulated and -unstimulated cells. Next, we linked this in vitro TGF-β-induced signature to a previously identified in vivo TRM-specific gene set and found considerable (&gt;50%) overlap between the two gene sets, thus showing that a substantial part of the TRM signature can be attributed to TGF-β signalling. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis further revealed that the altered gene signature following TGF-β exposure reflected transcriptional signatures found in TRM cells from both epithelial and non-epithelial tissues. In summary, these findings show that TGF-β has a broad footprint in establishing the residency-specific transcriptional profile of TRM cells, which is detectable in TRM cells from diverse tissues. They further suggest that constitutive TGF-β signaling might be involved for their long-term persistence at tissue sites.
Cells in organ primordia undergo active proliferation at an early stage to generate sufficient number, before exiting proliferation and entering differentiation. However, how the actively proliferating cells are developmentally reprogrammed to acquire differentiation potential during organ maturation is unclear. Here, we induced a microRNA-resistant form of TCP4 at various developmental stages of Arabidopsis leaf primordium that lacked the activity of TCP4 and its homologues and followed its effect on growth kinematics. By combining this with spatio-temporal gene expression analysis, we show that TCP4 commits leaf cells within the transition zone to exit proliferation and enter differentiation. A 24-hour pulse of TCP4 activity was sufficient to impart irreversible differentiation competence to the actively dividing cells. A combination of biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that TCP4 imparts differentiation competence by promoting auxin response as well as by directly activating HAT2, a HD-ZIP II transcription factor-encoding gene that also acts downstream to auxin response. Our study offers a molecular link between the two major organ maturation factors, CIN-like TCPs and HD-ZIP II transcription factors and explains how TCP activity restricts the cell number and final size in a leaf.
We report herein a series of lanthanide sulfate-carboxylpyrazolate frameworks based on double cuboid cavities that are highly hot-water stable, and have room-temperature proton conductivity of over 10-3 S cm-1 at 97% relative humidity without any appreciable loss of performance for at least three recycling times, ranking among the best lanthanide-based coordination frameworks.
Existing understanding of molecular composition of sputum and its role in tuberculosis patients is variously limited to its diagnostic potential. We sought to identify infection induced sputum proteome alteration in active/non tuberculosis patients (A/NTB) and their role in altered lung patho-physiology. Out of the study population (n = 118), sputum proteins isolated from discovery set samples (n = 20) was used for an 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute concentration analysis. A minimum set of protein with at least log2(ATB/NTB) &gt;±1.0 in ATB was selected as biosignature and validated in 32 samples. Predictive accuracy was calculated from area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) using a confirmatory set (n = 50) by Western blot analysis. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a set of 192 sputum proteins, out of which a signature of β-integrin, vitamin D binding protein:DBP, uteroglobin, profilin and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide was sufficient to differentiate ATB from NTB. AUC of ROC of the biosignature was calculated to 0.75. A shift in DBP-antimicrobial peptide (AMP) axis in the lungs of tuberculosis patients is observed. The identified sputum protein signature is a promising panel to differentiate ATB from NTB groups and suggest a deregulated DBP-AMP axis in lungs of tuberculosis patients.

Eukaryotic algae rose to ecological relevance after the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations, but the causes for this consequential evolutionary transition remain enigmatic. Cap carbonates were globally deposited directly after these glaciations, but they are usually organic barren or thermally overprinted. Here we show that uniquely-preserved cap dolostones of the Araras Group contain exceptional abundances of a newly identified biomarker: 25,28-bisnorgammacerane. Its secular occurrence, carbon isotope systematics and co-occurrence with other demethylated terpenoids suggest a mechanistic connection to extensive microbial degradation of ciliate-derived biomass in bacterially dominated ecosystems. Declining 25,28-bisnorgammacerane concentrations, and a parallel rise of steranes over hopanes, indicate the transition from a bacterial to eukaryotic dominated ecosystem after the Marinoan deglaciation. Nutrient levels already increased during the Cryogenian and were a prerequisite, but not the ultimate driver for the algal rise. Intense predatory pressure by bacterivorous protists may have irrevocably cleared self-sustaining cyanobacterial ecosystems, thereby creating the ecological opportunity that allowed for the persistent rise of eukaryotic algae to global importance.
There is a little available literature on injuries sustained due to bear attacks and their management. Bears are agile wild animals and injuries sustained after a bear attack have varying patterns. In general, such cases present to the emergency department with severe maxillofacial injuries with varying patterns, thereby limiting the use of common protocol for the management of such injuries. The aim of this article is to add to the current available literature on bear attacks, a present case of management of maxillofacial injury involving the orbit sustained after a bear attack.
The diffusion MRI "b-vector" table describing the diffusion sensitization direction can be flipped and permuted in dimension due to different orientation conventions used in scanners and incorrect or improperly utilized file formats. This can lead to incorrect fiber orientation estimates and subsequent tractography failure. Here, we present an automated quality control procedure to detect when the b-table is flipped and/or permuted incorrectly.
We define a "fiber coherence index" to describe how well fibers are connected to each other, and use it to automatically detect the correct configuration of b-vectors. We examined the performance on 3981 research subject scans (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging), 1065 normal subject scans of high image quality (Human Connectome Project), and 202 patient scans (Vanderbilt University Medical Center), as well as 9 in-vivo and 9 ex-vivo animal data.
The coherence index resulted in a 99.9% (3979/3981) and 100% (1065/1065) success rate in normal subject scans, 98% (198/202) in patient scans, and 100% (18/18) in both in-vivo and ex-vivo animal data in detecting the correct gradient table in datasets without severe image artifacts. The four failing cases (4/202) in patient scans, and two failures in healthy subject scans (2/3981), all showed prominent motion or signal dropout artifacts.
The fiber coherence measure can be used as an automatic quality assurance check in any diffusion analysis pipeline. Additionally, the success of this fiber coherence measure suggests potential broader applications, including evaluating data quality, or even providing diagnostic value as a biomarker of white matter integrity.
Tuberculosis (TB) claims the lives of 1.3 million people each year, more than any other bacterial infection. Hence great interest was generated in health communities upon the recent introduction of the new diarylquinoline anti-TB drug, bedaquiline. Bedaquiline acts by binding to the c-subunit in the membrane-bound FO portion of the F1FO-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, the universal enzyme that produces the ATP needed by cells. However, the mechanism of killing by bedaquiline is not fully understood. Recent observations related to the bactericidal effects of bedaquiline, which show that it is a potent uncoupler of respiration-driven ATP synthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis are summarized. These observations are then interpreted from the standpoint of Nath's two-ion theory of energy coupling in ATP synthesis (Nath, Biophys. Chem. 2017; 230:45-52). Especial importance is given to the interpretation of biochemical fluorescence quenching data, and the differences between the uncoupling induced by bedaquiline from that by the classical anionic uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation are highlighted. Suggestions for new experiments that could lead to a better understanding of the uncoupling mechanism are made. A model of uncoupling action by the drug is presented, and the biochemical basis underlying uncoupling of ATP synthesis and lethality in mycobacteria is elucidated. The major biological implications arising from these novel insights are discussed. It is hoped that the analysis will lead to a more fundamental understanding of biological energy coupling, uncoupling and transduction, and to an integrated view for the design of novel antimicrobials by future research in the field.
Apremilast is used as a systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This drug is considered relatively safe with a very low incidence of serious side effects. Common side effects are diarrhea, nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections which are mild to moderate in severity. Diarrhea tends to occur within 2 weeks of starting treatment and resolve spontaneously within 4 weeks without dose adjustment or discontinuation of therapy. Chronic diarrhea and malnutrition due to apremilast have not been reported yet. We report a case of apremilast induced chronic diarrhea leading to malnutrition, necessitating discontinuation of therapy.
Following second heart transplantation (HTx), some patients experience graft failure and require third-time heart transplantation. Little data exist to guide decision-making with regard to repeat retransplantation in older patients.
We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients receiving a third HTx, as identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1985 to 2017.
The study cohort consisted of N = 60 patients, with an average age of 29 with a standard deviation of ±18 years. Overall survival for the cohort at 1, 5, and 10 years is 83%, 64%, and 44%, respectively. The rate of third-time HTxs has steadily increased in all age groups. Patients older than 50 years now account for 18.3% of all third-time HTxs. Although this group demonstrated longer average previous graft survival, after third HTx they demonstrate significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to third-time HTx recipients younger than 21 (P = 0.05). Age over 50, BMI over 30, and diabetes were all found to be independent risk factors for decreased survival following third HTx.
We describe trends in patients undergoing third HTx. We highlight subsets of such recipients who exhibit decreased survival.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in gene regulation and are increasingly being recognized as crucial mediators of disease pathogenesis. However, the vast majority of published transcriptome datasets lack high-quality lncRNA profiles compared to protein-coding genes (PCGs). Here we propose a framework to harnesses the correlative expression patterns between lncRNA and PCGs to impute unknown lncRNA profiles. The lncRNA expression imputation (LEXI) framework enables characterization of lncRNA transcriptome of samples lacking any lncRNA data using only their PCG profiles. We compare various machine learning and missing value imputation algorithms to implement LEXI and demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to impute lncRNA transcriptome of normal and cancer tissues. Additionally, we determine the factors that influence imputation accuracy and provide guidelines for implementing this approach.
While improved access to safety net primary care providers, like federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), is often cited as a route to alleviate potentially preventable emergency department (ED) visits, no studies have longitudinally established the impact of improving access to FQHCs on ED use among Medicaid-insured and uninsured adults. We aimed to determine whether improved access to FQHCs was associated with lower ED use by uninsured and Medicaid-insured adults.
Using data from the Uniform Data System, U.S. Census Bureau, and California Office of Statewide Health Planning &amp; Development, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of 58 California counties from 2005 to 2013. For each county-year observation, we employed three measures of FQHC access: geographic density of FQHCs (delivery sites per 100 square miles), FQHCs per county resident (delivery sites per 100,000 county residents), and the proportion of Medicaid-insured or uninsured residents ages 19 to 64 years that utilized FQHCs. We then used a fixed-effects model to examine the impact of changes in the measures of FQHC access on ED visit rates by Medicaid-insured or uninsured adults in each county.
Increasing geographic density of FQHCs was associated with a 26% to 35% decrease in ED use by uninsured but not Medicaid-insured patients. Increasing numbers of clinics per county resident and higher percentages of Medicaid-insured and uninsured adults seen at FQHCs were not associated with reduced rates of ED use among either uninsured or Medicaid-insured adults.
We were unable to detect a consistent association between our measures of FQHC access and ED use by Medicaid-insured and uninsured nonelderly California adults, underscoring the importance of investigating additional drivers to reduce ED use among these vulnerable patient populations.
Although short-term trials have suggested that PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors are safe and reduce risk of cardiovascular diseases, their long-term safety is unclear. Genetic variants associated with lower activity of a gene can act as proxies to identify potential long-term side effects of drugs as recently exemplified by association of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering variants in the HMGCR (target for statins) and PCSK9 genes with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, analyses of the full spectrum of potential side effects of PCSK9 inhibition using a genetic approach have not been undertaken.
We examined the association of an LDL-lowering variant in the PCSK9 gene (T allele of rs1159147), as well as 2 LDL-lowering HGCMR variants (G allele of rs17238484 and T allele of rs12916) with 80 diseases and traits in up to 479 522 individuals in UK Biobank.
The PCSK9 T allele was significantly (Bonferroni P&lt;6.25×10-4) associated with risk of T2DM, increased body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and insulin use. The HMGCR variants were also associated with risk of T2DM, although their previously reported associations with anthropometric traits were found to be confounded. Mediation analysis suggested that the association of the PCSK9 T allele with risk of T2DM but not diastolic blood pressure was largely independent of its association with body mass index and central obesity. Nominally significant associations of the PCSK9 T allele were also seen with peptic ulcer disease, depression, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and venous thromboembolism.
Our findings support previous genetic analyses suggesting that long-term use of PCSK9 inhibitors, like statins, may be associated with increased risk of T2DM. Some other potential side effects need to be looked for in future studies of PCSK9 inhibitors, although we did not find signals that raise substantial concerns about their long-term safety.

CD47 is a ubiquitous cell surface receptor that directly regulates T cell immunity by interacting with its inhibitory ligand thrombospondin-1 and limits clearance of cells by phagocytes that express its counter-receptor signal-regulatory protein-α. Murine natural killer (NK) cells express higher levels of CD47 than other lymphocytes, but the role of CD47 in regulating NK cell homeostasis and immune function remains unclear. Cd47-/- mice exhibited depletion of NK precursors in bone marrow, consistent with the antiphagocytic function of CD47. In contrast, antisense CD47 knockdown or gene disruption resulted in a dose dependent accumulation of immature and mature NK cells in spleen. Mature Cd47-/- NK cells exhibited increased expression of NK effector and interferon gene signatures and an increased proliferative response to interleukin-15 in vitro. Cd47-/- mice showed no defect in their early response to acute Armstrong lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection but were moderately impaired in controlling chronic Clone-13 LCMV infection, which was associated with depletion of splenic NK cells and loss of effector cytokine and interferon response gene expression in Cd47-/- NK cells. Broad CD47-dependent differences in NK activation, survival, and exhaustion pathways were observed in NK cell transcriptional signatures in LCMV infected mice. These data identify CD47 as a cell-intrinsic and systemic regulator of NK cell homeostasis and NK cell function in responding to a viral infection.
Cathepsin S (CTSS) is a cysteine protease that is observed at higher concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects.
The objective of this study was to investigate whether CTSS is involved in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-induced COPD and determine whether targeting upstream signaling could prevent the disease.
CTSS expression was investigated in animal and human tissue and cell models of COPD. Ctss-/- mice were exposed to long-term cigarette smoke and forced oscillation and expiratory measurements were recorded. Animals were administered chemical modulators of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity.
Here we observed enhanced CTSS expression and activity in mouse lungs following exposure to cigarette smoke. Ctss-/- mice were resistant to cigarette smoke-induced inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, airspace enlargements and loss of lung function. CTSS expression was negatively regulated by PP2A in human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from healthy non-smokers and COPD donors and in monocyte-derived macrophages. Modulating PP2A expression or activity, with silencer short interfering RNA or a chemical inhibitor or activator, during acute smoke exposure in mice altered inflammatory responses and CTSS expression and activity in the lung. Enhancement of PP2A activity prevented chronic smoke-induced COPD in mice.
Our study indicates that the decrease in PP2A activity that occurs in COPD contributes to elevated CTSS expression in the lungs and results in impaired lung function. Enhancing PP2A activity represents a feasible therapeutic approach to reduce CTSS activity and counter smoke-induced lung disease.
In academic medicine, the attrition of the physician-scientist workforce has been significantly discussed for the past three decades, with substantial attention and funding targeted to stop this attrition and attempt to reinvigorate the workforce. Despite these concerns and efforts, the attrition has not been stopped or even significantly slowed, and thus a further understanding of the physician-scientist workforce is needed with a closer look at how this workforce is measured and quantified. Through reviewing three methods by which physician-scientists are identified and understood, limitations in these definitions arise, leading to the basic question: Who qualifies to be a physician-scientist? Answering this question may lead to developing more comprehensive and less restrictive approaches when qualifying and measuring the physician-scientist workforce and appreciating the varying contributions physicians make to research. Through suggesting an expanded appreciation of these research contributions, recognition of collaboration, and funding models that support both of these aspects, the authors hope to add to the conversation by challenging traditional approaches and encouraging movement toward forward-looking definitions that encourage and promote all physicians to engage with research. This reimagining of physician-scientists will result not just in a remeasuring of the workforce but, subsequently, in strengthening the clinical and translational research continuum as well.
Primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of optimal cytoreduction in women who had surgical treatment of advanced stage (IIIC/IV) endometrial cancer. Secondary objective was to define demographic and surgico-pathologic variables that exerted a significant influence on survival outcomes.
Records of 45 patients with stage IIIC/IV Endometrial cancer who underwent surgery with cytoreductive intent between 2010 and 2016 were analysed. Data on disease distribution, surgical procedures, adjuvant therapy and survival times was collated. Survival curves were plotted by Kaplan Meier method and median survival estimates were compared using log rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent variables predictive of survival.
28 women (62.2%) had undergone primary surgery and 17 (37.8%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to delayed primary surgery. Optimal cytoreduction to &lt;/ = 1 cm visible disease was achieved in 29 women (64.4%). Among 29 women who had optimal debulking, 24 had no visible disease. Median overall survival for the entire study cohort was 24 months. Median progression free survival in the optimal cytoreduction group was 16 months as opposed to 11.5 months in women who had &gt; 1 cm residual disease (p = 0.02). Median overall survival was 29 months in patients who had optimal cytoreduction and 17.5 months in women who had bulky residual disease (p=0.002). Only poor performance status (p = 0.035), presence of bowel disease (p = 0.05) and suboptimal cytoreduction (p = 0.006) retained significance as predictors of poor survival on multivariate analyses. Suboptimal cytoreduction surgery, compared to optimal cytoreduction, showed a 3.55-fold increased risk of death independent of performance status and anatomic region with disease (Hazard Ratio 3.55 (95% confidence interval 1.44-8.73) p = 0.006).
Survival analyses demonstrate significantly better progression free survival and overall survival when optimal cytoreduction is achieved. A prospective, multicentre study is recommended to establish conclusive evidence.
We present first evidence that the cosine of the CP-violating weak phase 2β is positive, and hence exclude trigonometric multifold solutions of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) Unitarity Triangle using a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis of B^{0}→D^{(*)}h^{0} with D→K_{S}^{0}π^{+}π^{-} decays, where h^{0}∈{π^{0},η,ω} denotes a light unflavored and neutral hadron. The measurement is performed combining the final data sets of the BABAR and Belle experiments collected at the ϒ(4S) resonance at the asymmetric-energy B factories PEP-II at SLAC and KEKB at KEK, respectively. The data samples contain (471±3)×10^{6}BB[over ¯] pairs recorded by the BABAR detector and (772±11)×10^{6}BB[over ¯] pairs recorded by the Belle detector. The results of the measurement are sin2β=0.80±0.14(stat)±0.06(syst)±0.03(model) and cos2β=0.91±0.22(stat)±0.09(syst)±0.07(model). The result for the direct measurement of the angle β of the CKM Unitarity Triangle is β=[22.5±4.4(stat)±1.2(syst)±0.6(model)]°. The measurement assumes no direct CP violation in B^{0}→D^{(*)}h^{0} decays. The quoted model uncertainties are due to the composition of the D^{0}→K_{S}^{0}π^{+}π^{-} decay amplitude model, which is newly established by performing a Dalitz plot amplitude analysis using a high-statistics e^{+}e^{-}→cc[over ¯] data sample. CP violation is observed in B^{0}→D^{(*)}h^{0} decays at the level of 5.1 standard deviations. The significance for cos2β&gt;0 is 3.7 standard deviations. The trigonometric multifold solution π/2-β=(68.1±0.7)° is excluded at the level of 7.3 standard deviations. The measurement resolves an ambiguity in the determination of the apex of the CKM Unitarity Triangle.
The year 2002 marked the tercentenary of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's discovery of desiccation tolerance in animals. This remarkable phenomenon to sustain 'life' in the absence of water can be revived upon return of hydrating conditions. Today, coping with climate change-related factors, especially temperature-humidity imbalance, is a global challenge. Under such adverse circumstances, desiccation tolerance remains a prime mechanism of several plants and a few animals to escape the hostile consequences of fluctuating hydroperiodicity patterns in their habitats. Among small animals, insects have demonstrated impressive resilience to dehydration and thrive under physiological water deficits without compromising on revival and survival upon rehydration. The focus of this review is to compile research insights on insect desiccation tolerance, gathered over the past several decades from numerous laboratories worldwide working on different insect groups. We provide a comparative overview of species-specific behavioral changes, adjustments in physiological biochemistry and cellular and molecular mechanisms as few of the noteworthy desiccation-responsive survival kits in insects. Finally, we highlight the role of insects as potential mechanistic models in tracking global warming which will form the basis for translational research to mitigate periods of climatic uncertainty predicted for the future.
Recent commentary in Neurotherapeutics by Nath critically addresses the earlier report by Tzeng et al. that aggressive antiviral treatment (AVT) against herpes simplex virus (HSV) was associated with a later decrease in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nath raises issues that we respond to: we point out that (i) the treated group (probably with severe infection) is likely to harbor genetic risk alleles that predispose to both AD and HSV infection-the potential treatment bias cited by Nath would support (rather than challenge) the preventive effect of AVT; (ii) HSV is well known to establish persistent infection in the brain; and (iii) current AVT compounds used to combat herpes viruses are highly specific for this class of viruses. Instead of "alternative fact," the findings of Tzeng et al. argue in favor of clinical trials of AVT in AD.
Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn's disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders.
This study aims to investigate the characteristics and mental health status of pregnant women with disordered personality traits. A cross-sectional study of a stratified sample of 545 women attending antenatal booking at a South London maternity service was conducted. Disordered personality traits were assessed using the Standardised Assessment of Personality-Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS). Mental disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV (SCID). Logistic regression was used to model associations, adjusting for confounders. Complete SAPAS data were collected for over 99% of women (n = 541). The weighted prevalence of elevated disordered personality traits (SAPAS ≥ 3) was 16.2% (95% CI 12.6-20.5). Women with elevated disordered personality traits were younger, less likely to live alone and more likely to report living in insecure accommodation. Among women with elevated disordered personality traits, the most common mental disorders were anxiety disorders (31.4%) and depressive disorders (17.6%). Each extra item endorsed on the SAPAS was associated with an 82% higher odds of meeting criteria for an Axis I mental disorder (adjusted OR 1.82 (1.42-2.33); p &lt; 0.001). Women with elevated disordered personality traits were at significantly increased risk of experiencing thoughts of self-harm (adjusted OR 2.12 (1.33-3.40); p = 0.002). Pregnant women with disordered personality traits are a particularly vulnerable population, with multiple psychosocial problems that are likely to require tailored support to ameliorate future health risks for mother and baby.
Novel 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline-based 1,2,3-triazole hybrids were synthesised in good yields by CuI -catalysed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions of 2-azido-N-(7-chloroquinolin-4-ylaminoalkyl)acetamides with various terminal alkynes. These new hybrids were screened in vitro against asexual blood stages of the chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 strain of P. falciparum. The most active compounds were further screened against asexual and sexual stages (gametocytes) of the chloroquine-resistant RKL-9 strain of P. falciparum. Although all compounds were less potent than chloroquine against the 3D7 strain, the three best compounds were appreciably more active than chloroquine against the RKL-9 strain, displaying IC50 values of &lt;100 nm, with one of them having an IC50 of 2.94 nm. Further, the lead compounds were gametocytocidal with IC50 values in the micromolar range, and were observed to induce morphological deformations in mature gametocytes. Most compounds demonstrated little or no cytotoxicity and exhibited good selectivity indices. The most active compounds represent promising candidates for further evaluation of their schizonticidal and gametocytocidal potential.
Bronchoscopic lung cryobiopsy (BLC) is a novel technique for obtaining lung tissue for the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases. The procedure is performed using several different variations of technique, resulting in an inconsistent diagnostic yield and a variable risk of complications. There is an unmet need for standardization of the technical aspects of BLC.
This is a position statement framed by a group comprising experts from the fields of pulmonary medicine, thoracic surgery, pathology, and radiology under the aegis of the Indian Association for Bronchology. Sixteen questions on various technical aspects of BLC were framed. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases. The expert group discussed the available evidence relevant to each question through e-mail and a face-to-face meeting, and arrived at a consensus.
The experts agreed that patients should be carefully selected for BLC after weighing the risks and benefits of the procedure. Where appropriate, consideration should be given to perform alternate procedures such as conventional transbronchial biopsy or subject the patient directly to a surgical lung biopsy. The procedure is best performed after placement of an artificial airway under sedation/general anesthesia. Fluoroscopic guidance and occlusion balloon should be utilized for positioning the cryoprobe to reduce the risk of pneumothorax and bleeding, respectively. At least four tissue specimens (with at least two of adequate size, i.e., ≥5 mm) should be obtained during the procedure from different lobes or different segments of a lobe. The histopathological findings of BLC should be interpreted by an experienced pulmonary pathologist. The final diagnosis should be made after a multidisciplinary discussion. Finally, there is a need for structured training for performing BLC.
This position statement is an attempt to provide practical recommendations for the performance of BLC in DPLDs.
Five new water-soluble amido- and aminoanthraquinone pigments, hypalocrinins A-E (1-5), the new amidoanthraquinone biaryls hypalocrinin F (6) and hypalocrinin G (7), and the known compounds 6-bromoemodic acid (8), crinemodin (9), and crinemodin sulfate (10) were isolated from the deep sea crinoid Hypalocrinus naresianus collected off Japan. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Amido- and aminoquinones are quite unusual among natural products. The hypalocrinins are the first naturally occurring anthraquinones and anthraquinone biaryls conjugated with taurine.
The perception gained by retina implants (RI) is limited, which asks for a learning regime to improve patients' visual perception. Here we simulated RI vision and investigated if object recognition in RI patients can be improved and maintained through training. Importantly, we asked if the trained object recognition can be generalized to a new task context, and to new viewpoints of the trained objects. For this purpose, we adopted two training tasks, a labelling task where participants had to choose the correct label out of other distracting labels for the presented object, and a reverse labelling task where participants had to choose the correct object out of other distracting objects to match the presented label. Our results showed that, despite of the task order, recognition performance was improved in both tasks and lasted at least for a week. The improved object recognition, however, can be transferred only from the labelling task to the reverse labelling task but not vice versa. Additionally, the trained object recognition can be transferred to new viewpoints of the trained objects only in the labelling task but not in the reverse labelling task. Training with the labelling task is therefore recommended for RI patients to achieve persistent and flexible visual perception.
Increasing numbers of patients with end-stage renal failure are receiving kidneys from nondirected kidney donors (NKDs), also known as altruistic donors. Transplant outcomes for recipients of such kidneys are largely inferred from studies on specified kidney donors (SKDs), which may be inaccurate due to differences in donor, recipient and transplant specific factors. We report the outcomes for recipients of NKD in the United Kingdom.
Outcomes for 6861 patients receiving a living donor kidney transplant between January 2007 and December 2014 were analyzed using both the National Health Service Blood and Transplant and the UK Renal Registry datasets. Graft and patient outcomes were compared for patients receiving NKD and SKD organs using univariable and multivariable analyses.
There was significant discordance between the NKD and SKD donors and recipients. These included increased donor age (median, 58 years vs 47 years; P &lt; 0.001) and higher rates of hemodialysis and previous transplants in the NKD group (both P &lt; 0.001). Despite such markers of increased risk among both donors and recipients of NKD kidneys, there was no difference in graft survival on univariable (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.86; P = 0.419) or multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.95; P = 0.665).
Despite some markers of transplant complexity, nondirected kidney donor organs are an excellent source of organs for transplantation.
The ability to evaluate empirical diffusion MRI acquisitions for quality and to correct the resulting imaging metrics allows for improved inference and increased replicability. Previous work has shown promise for estimation of bias and variance of generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) but comes at the price of computational complexity. This paper aims to provide methods for estimating GFA, bias of GFA and standard deviation of GFA quickly and accurately. In order to provide a method for bias and variance estimation that can return results faster than the previously studied statistical techniques, three deep, fully-connected neural networks are developed for GFA, bias of GFA, and standard deviation of GFA. The results of these networks are compared to the observed values of the metrics as well as those fit from the statistical techniques (i.e. Simulation Extrapolation (SIMEX) for bias estimation and wild bootstrap for variance estimation). Our GFA network provides predictions that are closer to the true GFA values than a Q-ball fit of the observed data (root-mean-square error (RMSE) 0.0077 vs 0.0082, p &lt; .001). The bias network also shows statistically significant improvement in comparison to the SIMEX-estimated error of GFA (RMSE 0.0071 vs. 0.01, p &lt; .001).
An induced stringent response, which is established by an increased level of (p)ppGpp, is required for the expression of β-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, it is not clear whether RSH (enzyme mediating stringent response to amino acid starvation) or small alarmone synthetases (SASs) are involved in the maintenance of (p)ppGpp level in response to β-lactams. Since the S. aureus genome encodes two active SASs (RelP and RelQ), their contribution to the expression of β-lactam resistance in MRSA was investigated. It was determined that relQ deletion renders community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) sensitive to β-lactams by negatively affecting the expression of mecA, and induction of (p)ppGpp synthesis by mupirocin bypasses the requirement of relQ for the expression of high-level β-lactam resistance. Surprisingly, relP deletion increased the level of β-lactam resistance. Such contradictory observations could be attributed to the fact that relQ promoter is ~5-fold stronger than the relP and is induced by oxacillin as well as deletion of either of the SASs, while relP promoter responds only to oxacillin. The stronger promoter activity of relQ, coupled with the inducibility of the relQ promoter in response to the lack of relP, results in efficient expression of relQ in the relP-deleted background. This positively affects mecA expression and renders the ΔrelP strain highly resistant. These findings indicate an important role for RelQ in the expression of high-level β-lactam resistance in MRSA.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most important endocrinal diseases in reproductive age group, clinically manifested by hyperandrogenism and anovulation and different other metabolic disturbances that may have important implications for long-term health.
The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of abnormal luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio in women with polycystic ovary and to assess the influence of prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the elevated LH/FSH ratio.
Retrospective observational study.
Eighty-five women in reproductive age diagnosed with PCOS between June 2012 to June 2014 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in a tertiary care hospital were selected for the study. Serum LH and FSH levels were determined and LH/FHS ratio (normal range ≤2) calculated in the study subjects. They underwent a detailed clinical, hormonal, and metabolic evaluation, which was performed between the second and third days of a natural or induced menstrual period.
Elevated LH/FSH ratio was found in 60 women (70.58%). Normal gonadotropin ratio was detected in 25 women (29.41%). Statistically significant differences in serum TSH levels were noted between groups with normal and elevated LH/FSH ratio. However, no statistically significant difference was noted in other endocrine parameters. Further analysis revealed a slight negative correlation of TSH with prolactin in the study subjects of PCOS with an 'r' value of - 0.3.
LH/FSH ratio is one of the characteristic attribute of PCOS women. In the present study, this abnormality was detected in 70% of patients. Hypothyroidism was a common endocrinal abnormality and prolactin was inversely correlated to TSH levels in PCOS patients.
Anemia affects almost two-thirds of pregnant women in developing countries and contributes to maternal mortality and low birthweight. According to the National Family Health Survey-4 reports, maternal anemia continues to be a public health problem.
To study the prevalence of anemia and its risk factors among pregnant women attending a public-sector hospital.
This study was nested within an ongoing cohort study "ÇASCADE" which is exploring the effect of prenatal exposure to maternal cortisol and psychological distress on infant development in Bangalore. The respondents were enrolled from the antenatal clinic at Jayanagar General Hospital, which is a sub-district hospital. A total of 280 women who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were enrolled.
The prevalence of anemia was observed to be 33.9%; proportion of mild and moderate anemia was almost similar (48.4 and 49.5%). The mean hemoglobin level of all the participants was 11.33 ± 1.460 g/dl. The mean hemoglobin level concentration was high during early gestation with a slight decrease by 21-24 weeks. Prenatal depression but not anxiety appeared to be a strong predictor of anemia on bivariate as well as multivariate analysis. No association was observed with socio-demographic and obstetric variables.
The burden of maternal anemia was considerably high in the study population. Although iron-folic acid supplementation is available under the national health program to address this issue, it is important to consider and address other risk factors when designing and implementing target interventions for anemia control in selected populations.
Well testing in the floodplain of the Brahmaputra River in Golaghat and Jorhat districts of Assam, India, shows that groundwater arsenic (As) concentrations increase with distance from the river. To establish the origin of this pattern, an additional 900 wells &lt;60 m deep were tested for As and 9 sites were drilled along a 35-km transect perpendicular to the river. The field data show no relation between groundwater As concentrations ranging from &lt;1 to 660 μg/L along the transect and (a) As concentrations of &lt;1-5 mg/kg in cuttings of aquifer sand recovered while drilling or (b) the degree of reduction of iron oxides in these cuttings. The drilling indicates, however, a marked increase in the thickness of a clay layer capping the aquifer starting from &lt;1-5 m near the river to over 60 m at the most distant site towards the base of the Naga foothills. Organic radiocarbon ages of 18-46 kyr obtained from all but one of 13 clay samples indicate pre-Holocene deposition of the underlying sands across the entire transect. Radiocarbon ages of dissolved inorganic carbon of 0.2, 4.7, and 17.8 kyr were measured in groundwater from 3 monitoring wells installed to 30-60 m depth at distances of 10, 20, and 40 km from the river, respectively. A conceptual groundwater flow model consistent with monitored heads and groundwater ages suggests that thick clay layers capping the aquifer further from the river inhibited flushing of the aquifer and, as a result, preserved higher As levels in groundwater.
Aging negatively impacts vitality and health. Many genetic pathways that regulate aging were discovered in invertebrates. However, the genetics of aging is more complex in vertebrates because of their specialized systems. This Review discusses advances in the genetic regulation of aging in vertebrates from work in mice, humans, and organisms with exceptional lifespans. We highlight challenges for the future, including sex-dependent differences in lifespan and the interplay between genes and environment. We also discuss how the identification of reliable biomarkers of age and development of new vertebrate models can be leveraged for personalized interventions to counter aging and age-related diseases.
Microbial biofilms are gaining importance in agriculture, due to their multifaceted agronomic benefits and resilience to environmental fluctuations. This study focuses on comparing the influence of single inoculation-Azotobacter chroococcum (Az) or Trichoderma viride (Tv) and their biofilm (Tv-Az), on soil and plant metabolic activities in wheat and cotton grown under Phytotron conditions. Tv-Az proved superior to all the other treatments in terms of better colonisation, plant growth attributes and 10-40% enhanced availability of macronutrients and micronutrients in the soil, over control. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy showed that the cells attached to the root tips initially, followed by their proliferation along the surface of the roots. Soil polysaccharides, proteins and dehydrogenase activity showed several fold enhancement in Tv-Az biofilm inoculated samples. Time course studies revealed that the population of Az and Tv in the rhizoplane and rhizosphere was significantly higher with a 0.14-0.31 log colony-forming unit (CFU) increase in the biofilm-inoculated treatment in both crops. Enhancement in soil biological activities was facilitated by the improved colonisation of the biofilm, due to the synergistic association between Tv and Az. This demonstrates the utility of Tv-Az biofilm as a multifunctional plant growth promoting and soil fertility enhancing option in agriculture.
Site-directed mutagenesis of β-1,4-endoglucanase from family 5 glycoside hydrolase (CtGH5) from Clostridium thermocellum was performed to develop a mutant CtGH5-F194A that gave 40 U/mg specific activity against carboxymethyl cellulose, resulting 2-fold higher activity than wild-type CtGH5. CtGH5-F194A was fused with a β-1,4-glucosidase, CtGH1 from Clostridium thermocellum to develop a chimeric enzyme. The chimera (CtGH1-L1-CtGH5-F194A) expressed as a soluble protein using E. coli BL-21cells displaying 3- to 5-fold higher catalytic efficiency for endoglucanase and β-glucosidase activities. TLC analysis of hydrolysed product of CMC by chimera 1 revealed glucose as final product confirming both β-1,4-endoglucanase and β-1,4-glucosidase activities, while the products of CtGH5-F194A were cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides. Protein melting studies of CtGH5-F194A showed melting temperature (Tm), 68 °C and of CtGH1, 79 °C, whereas, chimera showed 78 °C. The improved structural integrity, thermostability and enhanced bi-functional enzyme activities of chimera makes it potentially useful for industrial application in converting biomass to glucose and thus bioethanol.
Homeopathy is a controversial form of complementary therapy, but is widely practised to treat asthma. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the controlled trials of homeopathy in bronchial asthma. Relevant trials published between Jan 1, 1981, and Dec 31, 2016, were considered. Substantive research articles, conference proceedings, and master and doctoral theses were eligible. Methodology was assessed by Jadad's scoring, internal validity by the Coch-rane tool, model validity by Mathie's criteria, and quality of individualization by Saha's criteria. Sixteen trials were eligible. The majority were positive, especially those testing complex formulations. Methodological quality was diverse; 8 trials had "high" risk of bias. Model validity and individualization quality were compromised. Due to both qualitative and quantitative inadequacies, proofs supporting individualized homeopathy remained inconclusive. The trials were positive (evidence level A), but inconsistent, and suffered from methodological heterogeneity, "high" to "uncertain" risk of bias, incomplete study reporting, inadequacy of independent replications, and small sample sizes.
Homöopathie ist eine kontrovers diskutierte Methode der Komplementärmedizin, die in der Asthmabehandlung dennoch häufig eingesetzt wird. Mit der vorliegenden systematischen Übersichtsarbeit sollen die kontrollierten Studien zur Homöopathie bei Asthma bronchiale bewertet werden. Dabei wurden relevante Studien, die zwischen dem 1. Januar 1981 und dem 31. Dezember 2016 veröffent­licht worden waren, berücksichtigt. Stichhaltige wissenschaftliche Artikel, Kongressbände sowie Master- und Doktorarbeiten wurden in die Untersuchung eingeschlossen. Die Bewertung der Methodik erfolgte anhand der Jadad-Skala sowie durch Beurteilung der internen Validität mittels Cochrane-Tool, der Modellvalidität gemäß den Mathie-Kriterien und der Qualität der Individualisierung entsprechend den Saha-Kriterien. Sechzehn Studien wurden in die Arbeit eingeschlossen. Die meisten kamen zu positiven Ergebnissen, insbesondere jene, die komplexe Formulierungen untersuchten. Hinsichtlich der methodischen Qualität unterschieden sich die Studien, und 8 Studien wiesen ein “hohes” Verzerrungsrisiko auf. Modellvalidität und Qualität der Individualisierung waren eingeschränkt. Aufgrund der qualitativen und quantitativen Unzulänglichkeiten fanden sich keine eindeutigen Hinweise, die die individualisierte Homöopathie stützen. Die Studien fielen positiv (Evidenzklasse A), jedoch inkonsistent, aus und waren durch ihre methodische Heterogenität, ein “hohes” bis “unklares” Verzerrungsrisiko, unvollständige Studienberichte, Unzulänglichkeit der unabhängigen Wiederholungen sowie kleine Stichprobengrößen eingeschränkt.
The capability of a surfactant to sequester a drug bound to plasma protein was investigated using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Surfactants are known to denature protein, and hence are not suitable for the sequestration of a drug from protein. Herein, we show that the denaturing capacity of a surfactant is curtailed completely and its drug sequestration power is enhanced in the presence of biocompatible Pluronic micelles due to the formation of unique supramolecular assemblies. Further, our detailed studies indicate that the concentration of surfactant required for the sequestration of a drug is less than its critical micellar concentration (CMC). The extent of sequestration of drug by polymer-surfactant supramolecular assemblies can be tuned finely by controlling the concentration of surfactant. Detailed analysis showed that up to ∼85% sequestration of a drug from plasma protein could be achieved using a sub-CMC concentration of surfactant. Our results clearly show that controlled sequestration of a drug from plasma protein can be achieved with a reduction in the protein denaturing properties of surfactants.
Non-dividing hepatocytes in end-stage liver disease indicates permanent growth arrest similar to senescence. Identifying senescence in vivo is often challenging and mechanisms inhibiting senescence are poorly understood. In lower organisms mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) helps in increasing longevity; however, its role in senescence and liver disease is poorly understood. Aim of this study was to identify hepatocyte senescence and role of UPRMT in cryptogenic cirrhosis.
Doxorubicin was used to induce senescence in non-neoplastic hepatocytes (PH5CH8) and hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Huh7). Senescence-associated markers and unfolded protein response was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting and gene expression. Explants/biopsies from normal, fibrosis, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis without any known etiology were examined for presence of senescence and UPRMT by immunohistochemistry and gene expression.
Accumulation of senescent hepatocytes in cryptogenic cirrhosis was associated with reduced proliferation, increased expression of γH2AX and p21, together with loss of LaminB1. Dysfunctional mitochondria and compromised UPRMT were key features of senescent hepatocytes both in vitro and also in decompensated cirrhosis. Intriguingly, compensated cirrhotic liver mounted strong UPRMT, with high levels of mitochondrial protease, CLPP. Overexpression of CLPP inhibited senescence in vitro, by reducing mitochondrial ROS and altering oxygen consumption.
Our results implicate a role of hepatocyte senescence in cryptogenic cirrhosis together with a crucial role of UPRMT in preventing hepatocyte senescence. A compromised UPRMT may shift the fate of cirrhotic liver toward decompensation by exaggerating hepatocyte senescence. Restoring CLPP levels at least in cell culture appears as a promising strategy in mitohormesis, thereby, preventing senescence and possibly improving hepatocyte function.
Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive, androgen-dependent neuromuscular disease in men that is characterized by both muscle and synaptic dysfunction. Because gene expression in muscle is heterogeneous, with synaptic myonuclei expressing genes that regulate synaptic function and extrasynaptic myonuclei expressing genes to regulate contractile function, we used quantitative PCR to compare gene expression in these two domains of muscle from three different mouse models of SBMA: the "97Q" model that ubiquitously expresses mutant human androgen receptor (AR), the 113Q knock-in (KI) model that expresses humanized mouse AR with an expanded glutamine tract, and the "myogenic" model that overexpresses wild-type rat AR only in skeletal muscle. We were particularly interested in neurotrophic factors because of their role in maintaining neuromuscular function via effects on both muscle and synaptic function, and their implicated role in SBMA. We confirmed previous reports of the enriched expression of select genes (e.g., the acetylcholine receptor) in the synaptic region of muscle, and are the first to report the synaptic enrichment of others (e.g., glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor). Interestingly, all three models displayed comparably dysregulated expression of most genes examined in both the synaptic and extrasynaptic domains of muscle, with only modest differences between regions and models. These findings of comprehensive gene dysregulation in muscle support the emerging view that skeletal muscle may be a prime therapeutic target for restoring function of both muscles and motoneurons in SBMA.
This study was designed to investigate the transcriptional response of OmpF and OmpC along with an antisense RNA, MicF under concentration gradient carbapenem exposure.
An elevation in the expression of OmpF gene under concentration gradient imipenem stress from a particular concentration was observed. For OmpC gene a significant decrease in the expression was noticed under concentration gradient imipenem and meropenem stress. The study showed reduction in the expression of OmpC gene against imipenem and meropenem possibly preventing the entry of carbapenem antibiotic inside the cell indicating a possible role in carbapenem resistance.
Endocrine disruptors interfere with normal sexual and reproductive development of numerous organisms. Widely used in several chemical and manufacturing industries, nonylphenol (NP), a potent xenoestrogen, has the potential to perturb immune system. Using rat splenic macrophages (SMΦ) as the model system, NP-modulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response has been investigated. Our results demonstrate that NP (0.1-10 µM) attenuates catalase activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in LPS-treated SMΦ in vitro. NP inhibition of LPS-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression corroborate well with attenuation of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). Besides, elevated expression of anti-inflammatory factors reveals inverse correlation with suppression of endotoxin-induced M1 polarization in NP pre-incubated cells. While LPS promotes, NP prevents ERK1/2 (extracellular-signa1-regulated kinase 1/2) phosphorylation and MEK-inhibitor abrogates SOCS3 expression and NO production suggesting involvement of ERK1/2 in NP inhibition of SOCS3 expression. Further, translational inhibitor cycloheximide prevents LPS-induced NF-κB activation indicating functional importance of de novo synthesis of SOCS3, at least in part, in toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory response. Collectively, present study provides evidence favouring participation of SOCS3 in NP modulation of inflammatory response in rat SMΦ.
Axshya SAMVAD is an active tuberculosis (TB) case finding (ACF) strategy under project Axshya (Axshya meaning 'free of TB' and SAMVAD meaning 'conversation') among marginalized and vulnerable populations in 285 districts of India.
To compare patient characteristics, health seeking, delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation among new sputum smear positive TB patients detected through ACF and passive case finding (PCF) under the national TB programme in marginalized and vulnerable populations between March 2016 and February 2017.
This observational analytic study was conducted in 18 randomly sampled Axshya districts. We enrolled all TB patients detected through ACF and an equal number of randomly selected patients detected through PCF in the same settings. Data on patient characteristics, health seeking and delays were collected through record review and patient interviews (at their residence). Delays included patient level delay (from eligibility for sputum examination to first contact with any health care provider (HCP)), health system level diagnosis delay (from contact with first HCP to TB diagnosis) and treatment initiation delays (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Total delay was the sum of patient level, health system level diagnosis delay and treatment initiation delays.
We included 234 ACF-diagnosed and 231 PCF-diagnosed patients. When compared to PCF, ACF patients were relatively older (≥65 years, 14% versus 8%, p = 0.041), had no formal education (57% versus 36%, p&lt;0.001), had lower monthly income per capita (median 13.1 versus 15.7 USD, p = 0.014), were more likely from rural areas (92% versus 81%, p&lt;0.002) and residing far away from the sputum microscopy centres (more than 15 km, 24% versus 18%, p = 0.126). Fewer patients had history of significant loss of weight (68% versus 78%, p = 0.011) and sputum grade of 3+ (15% versus 21%, p = 0.060). Compared to PCF, HCP visits among ACF patients was significantly lower (median one versus two HCPs, p&lt;0.001). ACF patients had significantly lower health system level diagnosis delay (median five versus 19 days, p = 0.008) and the association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. Patient level and total delays were not significantly different.
Axshya SAMVAD linked the most impoverished communities to TB care and resulted in reduction of health system level diagnosis delay.
The objective of this study is to assess whether adult children's migration is associated with overall well-being of left-behind elderly parents in Nepal. A cross-sectional house-to-house survey was conducted among 260 community-dwelling elderly residents of Krishnapur municipality, Nepal. Binary logistic regression was used to identify whether migration of adult children was associated with elderly parent's self-reported chronic diseases, depressive symptoms, perceived loneliness and social support. More than half of the study household (51.2%) had at least one adult migrant child. Compared to participants without a migrant child, participants with a migrant child had higher odds of self-reported chronic diseases (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 0.91-3.54), presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 0.64-1.77), and self-perceived loneliness (OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.06-1.42) but except for loneliness, the odds ratio for other indicators of well-being were not statistically significant. Although the literature posits an inverse relationship between adult children's migration and the overall well-being of the elderly parents, in our study, adult children's migration was not associated with inverse health outcomes among study participants. However, from a policy perspective, it should be understood that these observations may be transient since the family structure of Nepalese society is rapidly changing.
Several isolates of Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) have been reported worldwide. They are members of either the Pacific Indian Ocean (PIO) or the South East Asian (SEA) group. However, there is only one completely sequenced isolate published from the northeastern part of India till date. Therefore, we obtained the complete sequences of all the six genomic components of a BBTV isolate from the northeastern Indian state of Assam. The isolate was named as BBTV-As-JOR, and its genome showed the presence of the reported conserved motifs. Nevertheless, like other Indian BBTV isolate, the major common regions in DNA-R and DNA-U3 of BBTV-As-JOR had deletions of 26 and 36 nucleotides, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 312 sequences of BBTV DNA-R classified BBTV-As-JOR as a member of the PIO group; similar phylogenetic patterns were also found with the other genomic segments. Analysis with Recombination Detection Program revealed two intra-segment recombination events involving DNA-C of geographically distinct BBTV isolates. On the other hand, DNA-U3 and DNA-N were found to be involved in few inter-segment recombination events in BBTV-As-JOR. This is the first report of a BBTV isolate from Assam and also of another PIO isolate from the region (the other isolate, BBTV-Umiam, was much closer to the SEA group). The detected possible recombinants could emerge as a major future threat for the banana cultivations in the country considering the asexual nature of propagation of banana crop.
Current methods to evaluate effects of kinase inhibitors in cancer are suboptimal. Analysis of changes in cancer metabolism in response to the inhibitors creates an opportunity for better understanding of the interplay between cell signaling and metabolism and, from the translational perspective, potential early evaluation of response to the inhibitors as well as treatment optimization. We performed genomic, metabolomic, and fluxomic analyses to evaluate the mechanism of action of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib (IBR) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. Our comprehensive analysis of the data generated by these diverse technologies revealed that IBR profoundly affected key metabolic pathways in IBR-sensitive cells including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis while having much less effects on IBR-poorly responsive cells. Changes in 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-detectable lactate and alanine concentrations emerged as promising biomarkers of response and resistance to IBR as demonstrated from experiments on various MCL cell lines. The metabolic network analysis on the 13C MRS and 13C LC/MS experimental data provided quantitative estimates of various intracellular fluxes and energy contributions. Glutaminolysis contributed over 50% of mitochondrial ATP production. Administration of the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 induced growth suppression of the IBR-poorly responsive cells.Implications: Our study demonstrates application of the advanced metabolomic/fluxomic techniques for comprehensive, precise, and prompt evaluations of the effects of kinase inhibition in MCL cells and has strong translational implications by potentially permitting early evaluation of cancer patient response versus resistance to kinase inhibitors and on design of novel therapies for overcoming the resistance.
To evaluate whether obstetric brachial plexus injury (OBPI) children who had mod Quad and triangle tilt surgeries maintained their recovered upper extremity functional movements over 10 years.
The short-term outcomes of surgery in OBPI patients are well documented. However, only a few publications with results over 10-year postoperative follow-up exist. We have previously reported the outcomes of these 2 surgeries in OBPI after 1, 2, and 5 years. Here, we report the successful outcomes in 17 of these patients over 10 years.
Seventeen OBPI patients, who had mod Quad, a modified muscle release operation and triangle tilt, a bony surgical procedure with us between 2005 and 2008, had postoperative follow-up of 10 years and met the inclusion criteria. Patients who had multiple surgeries and did not have 10-year follow-up are excluded in this study.
Fifteen of 17 children maintain their recovered upper extremity functions for extended long period (mean, 10 years; range, 9-13 years). There was statistically significant improvement in total functional Mallet score after 3 years (mean, 18.8 ± 2.1; P ≤ 0.01) from the preoperative mean total Mallet score of 14.5 ± 1.2. This improvement was not only maintained for extended period but also improved (mean total Mallet score, 20.35 ± 2.3; P ≤ 0.01) in some patients.
Overall, all upper extremity functions improved greatly after mod Quad and triangle tilt surgeries in OBPI children, and they were able to maintain their recovered functional movements over extended period of 10 years.
Plants with purple leave attain interest because of their biological importance. A new rice mutant, purple leaf (pl) was isolated from an indicia cultivar Zhenong 34, which was induced by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The genetic analyses substantiated that pl was corroborated by one recessive allele and confirmed by map based cloning using Insertion-Deletion (InDel) markers located on the long arm of chromosome 5. DNAseq data of the candidate part showed one bp insertion ('C' insertion) at +901 bp position in the 3rd exon of OsPL gene. The pl was characterized as purple leaves, sheaths and leaf senescence phenotype at late grain filling stage of growth cycle. It possessed abnormal cell with distorted chloroplasts, less chlorophyll, and increased anthocyanin content in leaves. The anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, OsPAL, OsCHS, OsANS, and OsMYB55 showed up-regulation in pl plants compared to wild type (WT). High super oxide dismutase enzyme (SOD), catalase enzyme activity (CAT), total soluble sugar (TSS) and malondialdehyde activity (MDA) were detected in the pl; contrastingly, photosynthesis linked genes were down-regulated. The germinated pl seeds showed comparatively higher temperature stress tolerance than WT. The phytohormones abscicic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) content were increased significantly in the pl plants. This research work will be provided information on better understanding of the molecular mechanism toward the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in rice. Therefore, OsPL gene could be a good genetic tool in marker aided backcrossing or gene editing for improving the rice cultivation in future.
Several studies have demonstrated associations between interleukin-18 polymorphisms and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in different populations except one of Indian origin. We therefore investigated for the influence of interleukin-18 (-1297T/C, -607A/C, -137G/C; + 105A/C) polymorphisms on genetic susceptibility and clinical expression of the disease in Indian systemic lupus erythematosus patients. A total of 200 systemic lupus erythematosus patients and 201 controls were recruited. Genotyping of interleukin-18 polymorphisms were performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum interleukin-18 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Interleukin-18 (-1297T/C; -137G/C) polymorphisms showed significant association with genetic susceptibility to the disease in our systemic lupus erythematosus cohort. Stratification analysis revealed -1297CC and -1297C associated with renal involvement (odds ratio = 3.4, correcting p value = 0.0207), (odds ratio = 2.0, correcting p value = 0.0054) respectively. Additionally, -1297C allele frequency was significantly increased in patients with anti-nucleosome antibody (odds ratio = 2.1, correcting p value = 0.0301). Haplotype analysis showed CC haplotype strongly associated with serositis (odds ratio = 9.1, correcting p values = 0.0009) and neurologic involvement (odds ratio = 9.3, correcting p value = 0.0018). We reported a 2.7-fold increase in serum interleukin-18 levels in patients (511.5 ± 242.3 pg/ml) compared to controls (189.4 ± 80.8 pg/ml) ( p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, interleukin-18 levels were positively correlated with disease activity ( r = 0.548, p = 0.0001) and renal involvement in the patients with lupus nephritis ( r = 0.569, p &lt; 0.0001). In summary, interleukin-18 polymorphisms elucidated in this study appear to confer genetic susceptibility to the disease and are associated with renal, serositis and neurologic involvement in Indian systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
Multiple health problems have been reported in survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Attribution of these problems to the disease without a control group for analysis is difficult.
We enrolled a cohort of EVD survivors and their close contacts and prospectively collected data on symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. A subset of participants underwent ophthalmologic examinations. Persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA in semen samples from survivors was determined.
A total of 966 EBOV antibody-positive survivors and 2350 antibody-negative close contacts (controls) were enrolled, and 90% of these participants were followed for 12 months. At enrollment (median time to baseline visit, 358 days after symptom onset), six symptoms were reported significantly more often among survivors than among controls: urinary frequency (14.7% vs. 3.4%), headache (47.6% vs. 35.6%), fatigue (18.4% vs. 6.3%), muscle pain (23.1% vs. 10.1%), memory loss (29.2% vs. 4.8%), and joint pain (47.5% vs. 17.5%). On examination, more survivors than controls had abnormal abdominal, chest, neurologic, and musculoskeletal findings and uveitis. Other than uveitis (prevalence at enrollment, 26.4% vs. 12.1%; at year 1, 33.3% vs. 15.4%), the prevalence of these conditions declined during follow-up in both groups. The incidence of most symptoms, neurologic findings, and uveitis was greater among survivors than among controls. EBOV RNA was detected in semen samples from 30% of the survivors tested, with a maximum time from illness to detection of 40 months.
A relatively high burden of symptoms was seen in all participants, but certain symptoms and examination findings were more common among survivors. With the exception of uveitis, these conditions declined in prevalence during follow-up in both groups. Viral RNA in semen persisted for a maximum of 40 months.

We report the first observation of the double strange baryon Ξ(1620)^{0} in its decay to Ξ^{-}π^{+} via Ξ_{c}^{+}→Ξ^{-}π^{+}π^{+} decays based on a 980  fb^{-1} data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e^{+}e^{-} collider. The mass and width are measured to be 1610.4±6.0(stat)_{-4.2}^{+6.1} (syst)  MeV/c^{2} and 59.9±4.8(stat)_{-7.1}^{+2.8}(syst)  MeV, respectively. We obtain 4.0σ evidence of the Ξ(1690)^{0} with the same data sample. These results shed light on the structure of hyperon resonances with strangeness S=-2.
The early steps in the pathophysiology of celiac disease (CD) leading to loss of tolerance to gluten are poorly described. Our aim was to use RNA sequencing of duodenal biopsies in patients with active CD, CD in remission, and non-CD controls to gain insight into CD pathophysiology, identify additional genetic signatures linked to CD, and possibly uncover targets for future therapeutic agents.
We performed whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing of intestinal biopsies in subjects with active and remission CD and non-CD controls. We also performed functional pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes to identify statistically significant pathways that are up or down regulated in subjects with active CD compared to remission CD.
We identified the upregulation of novel genes including IL12R, ITGAM and IGSF4 involved in the immune response machinery and cell adhesion process in the mucosa of subjects with active CD compared to those in remission. We identified a unique signature of genes, related to innate immunity, perturbed exclusively in CD irrespective of disease status. Finally, we highlight novel pathways of interest that may contribute to the early steps of CD pathogenesis and its comorbidities such as the spliceosome, pathways related to the innate immune response, and pathways related to autoimmunity.
Our study confirmed previous findings based on GWAS and immunological studies pertinent to CD pathogenesis and describes novel genes and pathways that with further validation may be found to contribute to the early steps in the pathogenesis of CD, ongoing inflammation, and comorbidities associated with CD.
The present study was undertaken to develop a protocol for acquisition and analysis of images of ghee samples to derive mathematical parameters related to adulteration of cow ghee with vegetable fat and to develop a model to predict the adulteration levels. The images acquired using a flatbed scanner were quantified in terms of their pixel intensity, colour, morphological, textural and skeleton parameters using ImageJ software. The selected parameters were measured for images of pure cow ghee and compared with that obtained for ghee adulterated with 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% vegetable fat. The parameters were assessed for their ability to detect the fixed adulteration levels on a discrete scale was assessed using discriminant analysis and the adulteration levels of the samples were correctly classified to the extent of 92.2%. An equation for predicting adulteration levels on a continuous scale using regression analysis (adjusted R2 value 0.94) was developed, tested and further validated using a fresh data set including a commercially popular market sample of ghee giving a good fit (R2 value of 0.85).
Mushroom is a nutritious and palatable food with various health attributes. The mushroom powder is a rich source of vegetable protein. In the present study, efforts were made to optimize the process for making 'sev', a traditional Indian extruded snack, with the incorporation of mushroom powder (Agaricus bisporus) to the Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum L.) flour ('besan'). Response surface methodology with central composite rotary design was used to determine the optimum level of various ingredients for 'sev' which was then analyzed for various physicochemical and sensory characteristics. Storage studies of mushroom 'sev' (with and without rice starch/mashed potato) were done at 37 ± 1 °C. The product containing rice starch was found to be highly acceptable over that with mashed potato. The optimized mushroom 'sev' contains 7.93% mushroom powder, 8.91% rice flour, 75.95% Bengal gram flour and 7.2% other ingredients with high scores for different sensory attributes viz., colour (8.4), appearance (8.3), flavour (8.3), texture (8.5) and overall acceptability (8.4). The mushroom powder based 'sev' had 2.79% higher protein content than the control sample (without mushroom powder) with a storage life of at least 7 days at 37 ± 1 °C.
Tillage intensive cropping practices have deteriorated soil physical quality and decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) levels in rice-growing areas of South Asia. Consequently, crop productivity has declined over the years demonstrating the need for sustainable alternatives. Given that, a field experiment was conducted for six years to assess the impact of four tillage based crop establishment treatments [puddled transplant rice followed by conventional tillage in wheat/maize (CTTPR-CT), non-puddled transplant rice followed by zero-tillage in wheat/maize (NPTPR-ZT), zero-till transplant rice followed by zero-tillage in wheat/maize (ZTTPR-ZT), zero-tillage direct seeded rice followed by zero-tillage in wheat/maize (ZTDSR-ZT)], two residue management treatments [residue removal, residue retention (~33%)], and two cropping systems [rice-wheat, rice-maize] on soil aggregation, carbon pools, nutrient availability, and crop productivity. After six years of rotation, in top 0.2 m soil depth, zero-till crop establishment treatments (ZTTPR-ZT and ZTDSR-ZT) had higher (p &lt; 0.05) total organic carbon (TOC) over conventional tillage treatment (CTTPR-CT). Zero-till crop establishment treatments increased very-labile C faction (Cfrac1) by 21% followed by labile fraction (Cfrac2) (16%), non-labile fraction (Cfrac4) (13%) and less-labile fraction (Cfrac3) (7%). Notably, higher passive C-pool in conservation tillage practices over CTTPR-CT suggests that conservation tillage could stabilize the recalcitrant form of carbon that persists longer in the soil. Meantime, zero-till crop establishment treatments had higher (p &lt; 0.05) water stable macro-aggregates, macro-aggregates: micro-aggregates ratio and aggregate carbon content over CTTPR-CT. The treatment NPTPR-ZT significantly increased soil quality parameters over CTTPR-CT. However, the effect was not as prominent as that of ZTTPR-ZT and ZTDSR-ZT. Retention of crop residue increased (p &lt; 0.05) TOC (12%) and soil available nutrients mainly available-P (16%), followed by available-K (12%), DTPA-extractable Zn (11%), and available-S (6%) over residue removal treatment. The constructive changes in soil properties following conservation tillage and crop residue retention led to increased crop productivity over conventional CTTPR-CT. Therefore, conservation tillage (particularly ZTTPR-ZT and ZTDSR-ZT) and crop residue retention could be recommended in tropical rice-based cropping systems for improving soil quality and production sustainability.
Two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices of driven cold atoms can provide a useful platform to construct 2D electromagnetically induced grating (EIG) with parity-time (PT) antisymmetry. This atomic grating is achieved by the spatial modulations of the atomic density and frequency detunings in the four-level double-Λ atomic system. Gain-assisted PT antisymmetry allows us to realize lop-sided Raman-Nath diffraction with high diffraction efficiency at the exception point. It is shown that the nontrivial phenomenon originates from non-Hermitian degeneracy of PT antisymmetry. Our scheme may provide the possibility for active all-optical control and conversion of the spatial beam in optics.
Studies of vitamin D (VD) physiology suggest that effects of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could be much broader than rickets including cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, infection, and allergy and pregnancy complications. Data regarding the prevalence of hypovitaminosis in pregnancy are scanty especially in north eastern part of India. Therefore, this study has undertaken with the intention to find out prevalence and outcome of hypovitaminosis of VD in pregnancy.
In total, 177 pregnant women with singleton pregnancy, &lt;16 weeks of gestational age, visited to antenatal clinic of our institute were consecutively enrolled for the study. The serum VD was estimated by Beckman coulter unicel DXI immunoassay system using the principle of Chemiluminescence. Incidence of vitamin deficiency and insufficiency calculated. VDD was defined as 25(OH)D levels in blood &lt;20 ng/mL, and insufficiency of VD was defined as 25(OH)D levels &lt;32 ng/mL. Antenatal complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), oligohydramnios, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, if any, were noted. Labor and delivery information including induction of labor, mode of delivery, and newborn birth weight were noted.
In total, 177 women recruited for the study. Mean age and parity of the subjects were 26.71 ± 9.96 and 2.10 ± 1.8, respectively. For detailed statistical analysis, women were divided into three groups depending upon their VD levels: deficiency group [25(OH)D level &lt;20 ng/mL], insufficiency group [25(OH)D level &lt;32 ng/mL], and sufficient group [25(OH)D level &gt;32 ng/mL]. VDD was present in 84.18% subjects. VD insufficiency was present in 12.44% of cases. There is association of preeclampsia, cesarean section, and low birth weight babies with lower level of VD.
This study showed that the prevalence of VDD in pregnancy is astonishingly high till now there is no guideline to screen antenatal women for VDD. As the test is costly even, offering it to all at-risk women may not be cost effective compared with offering universal supplementation, particularly as treatment is regarded as being very safe.
In a developing country like India, with a lot of psychosocial stressors and ample stigma toward psychiatry, we studied the sociodemographic pattern of the patients coming to a tertiary care center for emergency psychiatry services and also evaluated the types and pattern of emergency services provided to them. We also assessed the predominant presenting complaints with which patients presented at the emergency department, "reasons for referral" in an emergency by other departments, and types of psychiatric diagnoses in the patients.
Data were extracted retrospectively from the general emergency and psychiatry emergency register of Silchar Medical College and Hospital for 1 year and analyzed.
Out of 41,040 patients attending the hospital seeking emergency care, referral rate to the psychiatric emergency was only 2.8%. The commonest presenting complaint of subjects who were referred was "medically unexplained somatic complaints" (47.70%). The main reason for a referral from other departments was "no physical illness was detected" in the patient (38.59%). About 78.8% of the subjects were diagnosed as having a proper psychiatric illness, with the majority presenting with stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40-49) (43.45%).
This study highlights various important parameters regarding emergency services being provided and their utilization by the patients attending a psychiatric emergency, which could be helpful for future policies and resource allocation for providing superior quality and cost-effective mental health care to the patients.
Previously, we found that high levels of soluble insulin receptor (sIR) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of an HIV-infected women cohort were associated with the presence and severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In this study we investigated if CSF from this population, HIV-1 Tat, and selected cytokines induces sIR secretion from human neuronal cells. Twenty-three (23) HIV-seropositive women stratified by cognitive status and five HIV- seronegative women were evaluated. Soluble IR levels were measured in the extracellular medium of neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) that were exposed (for 24 h) to the CSF of patients. The levels of sIR, HIV-1 Tat, and cytokine levels (IL-2, IL4, IL-6, IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-10) were quantified in the CSF of participants by ELISA and flow cytometry. Neuronal secretion of sIR was measured after exposure (24 h) to HIV-1 Tat (0.5-250 nM), or specific cytokines. The effects of TNFα and HIV-1 Tat on sIR secretion were also evaluated in the presence of R7050 (TNFα antagonist; 10 nM). Neurons exposed to the CSF of HIV-infected women had higher sIR levels according to the severity of neurocognitive impairment of the participant. Increased CSF sIR levels were associated with the presence and severity of HAND and were positively correlated with CSF HIV-1 Tat levels in HIV-infected women with cognitive impairment. CSF levels of IL-2, IFNγ, and TNFα were significantly increased with HAND. However, only TNFα (5 pg/mL) and HIV-1 Tat (100 nM) induced a significant increase in neuronal sIR secretion after 24 h exposure, an effect that was antagonized when each were combined with R7050. Our data suggests that TNFα and HIV-1 Tat from the CSF of HIV-infected women may regulate the secretion of sIR from neuronal cells and that the effect of HIV-1 Tat on sIR secretion may depend on TNFα receptor activation.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic brain infection that is caused by the JC virus and is typically fatal unless immune function can be restored. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a negative regulator of the immune response that may contribute to impaired viral clearance. Whether PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab could reinvigorate anti-JC virus immune activity in patients with PML was unknown.
We administered pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 to 6 weeks to eight adults with PML, each with a different underlying predisposing condition. Each patient received at least one dose but no more than three doses.
Pembrolizumab induced down-regulation of PD-1 expression on lymphocytes in peripheral blood and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in all eight patients. Five patients had clinical improvement or stabilization of PML accompanied by a reduction in the JC viral load in the CSF and an increase in in vitro CD4+ and CD8+ anti-JC virus activity. In the other three patients, no meaningful change was observed in the viral load or in the magnitude of antiviral cellular immune response, and there was no clinical improvement.
Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in some patients with PML, pembrolizumab reduces JC viral load and increases CD4+ and CD8+ activity against the JC virus; clinical improvement or stabilization occurred in five of the eight patients who received pembrolizumab. Further study of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of PML is warranted. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).
The development of cellular phone system has greatly increased the extent and magnitude of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) exposure. The RFR emitted from mobile phone and mobile phone base stations exerts thermal and non-thermal effects. The short-term and long-term exposure to RFR may have adverse effect on humans as well as animals. Most laboratory studies have indicated a direct link between exposure to RFR and adverse biological effects. Several in vitro studies have reported that RFR induces various types of cancer and DNA or chromosomal damage. On the other hand, some animal studies have not reported adverse effects of this radiation. The present review summarizes information available on the possible effects of RFR on the reproductive health.
Leaf senescence is the last period of leaf growth and a dynamic procedure associated with its death. The adaptability of the plants to changing environments occurs thanks to leaf senescence. Hence, transcriptional profiling is important to figure out the exact mechanisms of inducing leaf senescence in a particular crop, such as rice. From this perspective, leaf samples of two different rice genotypes, the brown midrib leaf (bml) mutant and its wild type (WT) were sampled for transcriptional profiling to identify differentially-expressed genes (DEGs). We identified 2670 DEGs, among which 1657 genes were up- and 1013 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs were enriched in binding and catalytic activity, followed by the single organism process and metabolic process through gene ontology (GO), while the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the DEGs were related to the plant hormone signal transduction and photosynthetic pathway enrichment. The expression pattern and the clustering of DEGs revealed that the WRKY and NAC family, as well as zinc finger transcription factors, had greater effects on early-senescence of leaf compared to other transcription factors. These findings will help to elucidate the precise functional role of bml rice mutant in the early-leaf senescence.
The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Cutaneous melanoma have been significantly revised over the past few years in response to emerging data on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies and BRAF-targeted therapy. This article summarizes the data and rationale supporting extensive changes to the recommendations for systemic therapy as adjuvant treatment of resected disease and as treatment of unresectable or distant metastatic disease.
To test the application of a clinical definition of life-threatening complications in pregnancy and determine the level of near miss maternal morbidity and mortality.
A prospective observational study was conducted in the obstetrics and gynaecology department, NRS Medical College, Kolkata, India, to identify life-threatening complications using a modification of the Mantel's criteria. The main outcome measures were validity of identification criteria, main causes and incidence of life-threatening complications in pregnancy, maternal near miss: case fatality rates, morbidity-mortality index and use rate of effective interventions.
In total, 177 maternal near miss and 23 maternal deaths were identified in the screened 4400 women. The incidence of near miss was 4.02%. Main causes of maternal mortality were hypertensive disorders (43%) and renal failure (21%). Main causes of near miss were hypertensive disorders (55%), ectopic pregnancy (19%). Near miss mortality index was 7.7:1.
A high proportion of women with life-threatening complications and all women who died were referred from peripheral hospitals. This signals that there may have been important failures in the referral system relating to maternal care and there is a need for further investigation.
Post-infection irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) can occur following acute gastroenteritis (AGE). This study was designed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of PI-IBS following AGE and to validate a PI-IBS risk score.
This prospective study was performed between September 2014 and October 2016 on AGE patients by documenting their AGE severity and following up after 3 and 6 months to study the development of IBS (ROME III criteria). The risk score was calculated for all the subjects, and its discrimination ability was tested.
Out of 136 hospitalized AGE patients, 35 developed PI-IBS after 6 months. The factors associated with PI-IBS were younger age, longer duration of AGE, anxiety, depression, abdominal pain, bloody stool, vomiting, fever, family history of IBS, and positive stool culture (univariate analysis); however, on multivariate analysis, younger age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.5; p 0.03), prolonged duration of AGE (AOR 8.6; p 0.01), and abdominal cramps (AOR 2.1; p 0.02) were the independent factors influencing its occurrence. PI-IBS occurred even after infection with Vibrio cholerae. The PI-IBS risk score was significantly higher in patients who developed PI-IBS (72.4 ± 14.48 vs. 31.56 ± 20.4, p-value &lt; 0.001); score &gt; 50 had a sensitivity and specificity of 91.4% and 84.2%, respectively.
One fourth of AGE patients developed PI-IBS after 6 months. Factors influencing its development were younger age, long duration of AGE, and abdominal pain. The PI-IBS risk score had good predictive accuracy in our population.
Collagen cross-linking (CXL) is an evolving procedure that enhances the biomechanical rigidity of the cornea and can slow or halt ectatic disease. CXL requires delivery of 5.4 J/cm2 of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation to a cornea saturated with riboflavin in order to induce cross-link formation. The conventional CXL procedure achieves this fluence by exposing the cornea to a 3 mW/cm2 UVA lamp for 30 min; however, some surgeons have proposed accelerated protocols which achieve the same fluence in a shorter period of time by using a higher power light source. Whether accelerated protocols are as effective in arresting ectasia as the established conventional procedure remains unclear. Accordingly, this study will systematically review and synthesise the evidence on accelerated CXL and compare it to the conventional approach across an array of clinical outcomes.
We will search 16 electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to February 1, 2019. We will include all randomised controlled trials comparing accelerated and conventional CXL for any corneal ectatic disease. Two reviewers will independently screen search results to identify eligible articles, complete data collection, and conduct quality assessment. The quality of individual trials will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Our primary outcome will be the change in maximal keratometry (Kmax) at 12 months following treatment. Additional outcomes will include: incidence of disease progression, incidence of serious adverse events, as well as change in Kmax at longest follow-up, mean stromal demarcation line depth, mean uncorrected distance visual acuity, mean corrected distance visual acuity, mean Kmax, mean endothelial cell density, mean central corneal thickness, mean spherical equivalent, mean intraocular pressure, and mean corneal power, at 12 months following treatment. We will calculate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate heterogeneity. We will rate the overall quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
This review will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence on accelerated and conventional CXL approaches and serve to inform clinical practice, medical device design, and future research. Evaluating variations of the CXL protocol aimed at reducing treatment duration is of critical importance and a prerequisite to expanding treatment availability to more patients.

Antheraea assamensis Helfer, popularly known as Muga silkworm, the golden silk producer of northeast India is economically important and unique among the Saturniid silkworms. In this study, the genetic diversity and phylogeny of semidomesticated and wild morphs of Muga silkwormcollected from different geographical locations of northeast India were investigated based on the sequences of five mitochondrial loci, i.e. 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, CoxI, Cytb and CR. All the five mitochondrial loci showed a strong bias towards higher 'A' and 'T' contents. Transitional substitutions were found to be more than the transversional substitutions. The rate of nucleotide substitution and average genetic divergence were found to be highest in CR sequences and lowest in 12S rRNA gene sequences among the morphs of Muga silkworm. The morphs collected from same geographical area had identical 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, CoxI and Cytb gene sequences. Moreover, the 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene sequences of somesemi-domesticated and wild morphs collected from different geographical locations were also found to be similar. In the phylogenetic trees generated based on themitochondrial loci, mixing of semi-domesticated and wild morphs was observed as they shared the same group. The information generated in this study will help in formulating strategies to conserve the natural biodiversity present among these unique silkworms in northeast India. In addition, this will be useful in identifying diverse morphs of Muga silkworm, which will help in effective breeding programmes to improve its productivity.
Polysorbate 80 is one of the most widely used solubilizing agents in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Influences of different classes of solubilizates and additives on its self-assembly characteristics are however, not sufficiently understood yet. In this manuscript, we show how common water structure making salt NaCl, and lipophilic phytochemicals like curcumin and lavender oil help in modulating the structure of Polysorbate 80 micelles in aqueous medium. Our DLS, SANS and rheological studies show that NaCl induces sphere-to-rod growth of polysorbate 80 micelles at the room temperature. Micellar solubilizations of the phytochemicals, which were found to be facilitated with increase in temperature, induce only a marginal growth of the micelles up to the highest level of solubilization. Their presence however, helps in modulating the NaCl induced micellar growth behavior in the tween 80 solutions leading to observation of micelle-to-vesicle structural transition at 2% lavender oil concentration. The phytochemical solubilized micellar solutions could be converted to alginate based hydrogel beads and patches that can freely release micellar phytochemical in aqueous medium. Our results shed light on possible ways of modulating the solubilization behavior, self-assembly characteristics and rheological properties of aqueous system of polysorbate 80, which could be important for their applications.
Insomnia is the most common sleep-related complaint associated with impaired day-time functioning, reduced quality of life, increased morbidity and substantial societal cost. We evaluated whether individualized homeopathy (IH) could produce significant effect beyond placebo in treatment of insomnia.
In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two parallel arms trial, 60 patients were randomized to receive either IH/verum or control/placebo (1:1). Patient-administered sleep diary (6 items; 1: latency to fall asleep, 2: minutes awake in middle of night, 3: minutes awake too early, 4: hours spent in bed, 5: total sleep time in hours, and 6: sleep efficiency) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were taken as the primary and secondary outcomes respectively, measured at baseline, and after 3 months.
Five patients dropped out (verum: 2, control: 3). Intention to treat sample (n = 60) was analyzed. Trial arms were comparable at baseline. In the verum group, except sleep diary item 3 (P =  0.371), rest of the outcomes improved significantly (all P &lt; 0.01). In the control group, there were significant improvements in diary item 6 and ISI score (P &lt; 0.01) and just significant improvement in item 5 (P =  0.018). Group differences were significant for items 4, 5 and 6 (P &lt; 0.01) and just significant (P =  0.014) for ISI score with moderate to large effect sizes; but non-significant (P &gt; 0.01) for rest of the outcomes.
IH seemed to produce significantly better effect than placebo. Rigorous trials and independent replications are warranted.
The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression has been mostly studied with a focus on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) leading to lack of data on non-BDNF neurotrophins (NTs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of antidepressant drugs on changes in serum nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin 4 (NT-4).
A prospective cohort study was conducted on 105 patients with depression who were subgrouped to the group 1 (mild and moderate depression without somatic syndrome treated with sertraline), group 2 (mild and moderate depression with somatic syndrome treated with dosulepin), and group 3 (severe depression without psychotic symptoms treated with venlafaxine). At baseline, the severity of depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]), serum NGF, NT-3, and NT-4 were estimated. Thirty-five healthy volunteers were recruited as controls for a baseline comparison of NTs. All patients were followed up after 6 weeks to evaluate the changes in NT levels and correlate it with the change in MADRS scores.
At baseline, NT levels were significantly lower in patients with depression in comparison with healthy control. In group 1, serum NGF, NT-3, and NT-4 level were found to increase significantly after treatment, whereas changes in groups 2 and 3 were statistically not significant. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score and serum NGF at baseline had an inverse relation (r = -0.648), whereas the change in MADRS score in sertraline group had a positive correlation (r = 0.86) with the change of serum NGF.
Monotherapy with sertraline increased the level of non-BDNF NTs; however, treatment with dosulepin and venlafaxine did not produce any significant changes in patients with depression.
We present the first measurements of absolute branching fractions of Ξ_{c}^{0} decays into Ξ^{-}π^{+}, ΛK^{-}π^{+}, and pK^{-}K^{-}π^{+} final states. The measurements are made using a dataset comprising (772±11)×10^{6} BB[over ¯] pairs collected at the ϒ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e^{+}e^{-} collider. We first measure the absolute branching fraction for B^{-}→Λ[over ¯]_{c}^{-}Ξ_{c}^{0} using a missing-mass technique; the result is B(B^{-}→Λ[over ¯]_{c}^{-}Ξ_{c}^{0})=(9.51±2.10±0.88)×10^{-4}. We subsequently measure the product branching fractions B(B^{-}→Λ[over ¯]_{c}^{-}Ξ_{c}^{0})B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→Ξ^{-}π^{+}), B(B^{-}→Λ[over ¯]_{c}^{-}Ξ_{c}^{0})B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→ΛK^{-}π^{+}), and B(B^{-}→Λ[over ¯]_{c}^{-}Ξ_{c}^{0})B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→pK^{-}K^{-}π^{+}) with improved precision. Dividing these product branching fractions by the result for B^{-}→Λ[over ¯]_{c}^{-}Ξ_{c}^{0} yields the following branching fractions: B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→Ξ^{-}π^{+})=(1.80±0.50±0.14)%, B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→ΛK^{-}π^{+})=(1.17±0.37±0.09)%, and B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→pK^{-}K^{-}π^{+})=(0.58±0.23±0.05)%. For the above branching fractions, the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. Our result for B(Ξ_{c}^{0}→Ξ^{-}π^{+}) can be combined with Ξ_{c}^{0} branching fractions measured relative to Ξ_{c}^{0}→Ξ^{-}π^{+} to yield other absolute Ξ_{c}^{0} branching fractions.
A new lysosome-targetable fluorescence sensor, Lyso-HGP, was designed and synthesized based on 4-methyl-2,6-diformylphenol as a fluorophore. Lyso-HGP displays highly sensitive fluorescent detection of Hg2+ in HEPES buffer solution (10 mM, DMSO 1%) of pH 7.0 at 37 °C due to the formation of highly fluorescent formyl-functionalized derivative Lyso-HGP-CHO. The sensor triggered a "turn-on" fluorescence response to Hg2+ with a simultaneous increase of fluorescence intensity by 180-fold just after 10 min. The response is very selective over a variety of biologically relevant cations, anions, molecules, and competitive toxic heavy metal cations. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated as low as 6.82 nM. So, it can be utilized to detect this toxic heavy metal in biology and environmental samples in an aqueous buffer medium. Also, the sensor is able to monitor the subcellular distribution of Hg2+ specifically localized in the lysosome's compartment in the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line by fluorescence microscopy.
Here we report a new three-dimensional nickel-based hybrid structure [Ni3(BTB)2(BPE)4(H2O)2]·2DMF·2H2O, 1 [where BTB = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene and BPE = 1,2-bis((4-pyridyl)ethane)], which exhibits long-range ferromagnetism and semiconductor behavior. The dipolar interaction between the magnetic spins is suggested to explain the development of long-range ferromagnetic ordering, where the superexchange interaction can be unwanted due to the large distance between the magnetic spins. Optical band gap and resistance vs. temperature measurements reveal the semiconductor nature of this compound. The density of states calculations shed light towards the origin of the low band gap value.
To test the hypothesis that unilateral sural nerve graft (SNG) interposition may improve the rate of urinary function (UF) recovery after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in patients undergoing unilateral nerve resection (UNR).
We studied 111 consecutive patients who underwent RRP with purposeful UNR performed by a single surgeon. Of the 111 patients, 53 underwent unilateral SNG interposition. All patients were invited to complete a questionnaire that included the validated University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index. The time to UF recovery above the median value of the group and urinary control status were evaluated.
The median follow-up was 26 and 12 months for the UNR and UNR+SNG patients, respectively. At 12 months after RRP, 94.7% of patients with UNR+SNG reported having complete urinary control or leakage of only a few drops of urine compared with 58.3% of patients with UNR alone (P = 0.012). In multivariate Cox regression models, UNR+SNG was associated with a 9.95 times greater rate of reaching a UF score above the median versus UNR alone (P &lt;0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, SNG status increased the odds of having complete urinary control or leakage of only a few drops of urine by 14.99 and 29.19 at 6 and 12 months after RRP, respectively (both P &lt;0.05).
In patients undergoing UNR surgery, SNG interposition is associated with a greater rate of UF recovery and a higher likelihood of urinary control after RRP. These findings need to be validated in larger, multicenter, prospective, randomized studies.
The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a central role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation. Results of treating prostate cancer by androgen ablation indicate that signals mediated through AR are critical for the growth of these tumors. Like other nuclear receptors, AR exerts its transcriptional function by binding to cis-elements upstream of promoters and interacting with other transcriptional factors (e.g. activators, repressors and modulators). To determine the mechanism of AR-regulated transcription, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify AR-associated proteins. One of the proteins we identified is identical to the human origin recognition complex-interacting protein termed HBO1. A ligand-enhanced interaction between AR and HBO1 was further confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that HBO1 is a nuclear protein, and Northern blot analysis revealed that it is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels present in human testis. HBO1 belongs to the MYST family, which is characterized by a highly conserved C2HC zinc finger and a putative histone acetyltransferase domain. Surprisingly, two yeast members of the MYST family, SAS2 and SAS3, have been shown to function as transcription silencers, despite the presence of the histone acetyltransferase domain. Using a GAL4 DNA-binding domain assay, we mapped a transcriptional repression domain within the N-terminal region of HBO1. Transient transfection experiments revealed that HBO1 specifically repressed AR-mediated transcription in both CV-1 and PC-3 cells. These results indicate that HBO1 is a new AR-interacting protein capable of modulating AR activity. It could play a significant role in regulating AR-dependent genes in normal and prostate cancer cells.
AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors mediate distinct postsynaptic signals that differ characteristically among synapses. How postsynaptic AMPA- and NMDA-receptor levels are regulated, however, remains unclear. Using newly generated conditional knockin mice that enable genetic control of neurexin alternative splicing, we show that in hippocampal synapses, alternative splicing of presynaptic neurexin-1 at splice site 4 (SS4) dramatically enhanced postsynaptic NMDA-receptor-mediated, but not AMPA-receptor-mediated, synaptic responses without altering synapse density. In contrast, alternative splicing of neurexin-3 at SS4 suppressed AMPA-receptor-mediated, but not NMDA-receptor-mediated, synaptic responses, while alternative splicing of neurexin-2 at SS4 had no effect on NMDA- or AMPA-receptor-mediated responses. Presynaptic overexpression of the neurexin-1β and neurexin-3β SS4+ splice variants, but not of their SS4- splice variants, replicated the respective SS4+ knockin phenotypes. Thus, different neurexins perform distinct nonoverlapping functions at hippocampal synapses that are independently regulated by alternative splicing. These functions transsynaptically control NMDA and AMPA receptors, thereby mediating presynaptic control of postsynaptic responses.
Neuronal activity-dependent gene transcription is a key feature of long-lasting synaptic strengthening associated with learning and memory, as well as activity-dependent neuroprotection. To comprehensively determine the molecular alterations, we carried out genome-wide microarray analysis in cultured rat cortical neurons treated with specific pharmacological agents, a model with alterations in neuronal activity, which were monitored by multi-site electrophysiological recordings. Of the approximately 27,000 genes, the expression of 248 genes was strongly changed in response to enhanced activity. These genes encompass a large number of members of distinct families, including synaptic vesicle proteins, ion channels, signal transduction molecules, synaptic growth regulators, and others. Two subsets of these genes were further confirmed to be specifically induced by Ca(2+) influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs). In addition, those genes dynamically regulated by the enhanced activity were also elucidated, as well as those candidate genes associated with synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. Our findings therefore would help define the molecular mechanisms that occur in response to neuronal activity and identify specific clusters of genes that contribute to activity-dependent and Ca(2+)-inducible modulation of brain development and function.
The spatial coordination of neurotransmitter receptors with other postsynaptic signaling and structural molecules is regulated by a diverse array of cell-specific scaffolding proteins. The synaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors by the stargazin protein in some neurons, for example, depends on specific interactions between the C terminus of stargazin and the PDZ [postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)/Discs large/zona occludens-1] domains of membrane-associated guanylate kinase scaffolding proteins PSD-93 or PSD-95. Stargazin [Cacng2 (Ca2+ channel gamma2 subunit)] is one of four closely related proteins recently categorized as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulating proteins (TARPs) that appear to share similar functions but exhibit distinct expression patterns in the CNS. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify MAGI-2 (membrane associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 2) as a novel candidate interactor with the cytoplasmic C termini of the TARPs. MAGI-2 [also known as S-SCAM (synaptic scaffolding molecule)] is a multi-PDZ domain scaffolding protein that interacts with several different ligands in brain, including PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), dasm1 (dendrite arborization and synapse maturation 1), dendrin, axin, beta- and delta-catenin, neuroligin, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, beta1-adrenergic receptors, and NMDA receptors. We confirmed that MAGI-2 coimmunoprecipitated with stargazin in vivo from mouse cerebral cortex and used in vitro assays to localize the interaction to the C-terminal -TTPV amino acid motif of stargazin and the PDZ1, PDZ3, and PDZ5 domains of MAGI-2. Expression of stargazin recruited MAGI-2 to cell membranes and cell-cell contact sites in transfected HEK-293T cells dependent on the presence of the stargazin -TTPV motif. These experiments identify MAGI-2 as a strong candidate for linking TARP/AMPA receptor complexes to a wide range of other postsynaptic molecules and pathways and advance our knowledge of protein interactions at mammalian CNS synapses.
The present study examined factors that may be involved in the development of hypoxic periventricular white matter damage in the neonatal brain. Wistar rats (1-day old) were subjected to hypoxia and the periventricular white matter (corpus callosum) was examined for the mRNA and protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), endothelial, neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, nNOS and iNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1) between 3 h and 14 days after hypoxic exposure by real-time RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1alpha, VEGF, NMDAR1, eNOS, nNOS and iNOS in corpus callosum was observed in response to hypoxia. NMDAR1 and iNOS expression was found in the activated microglial cells, whereas VEGF was localized to astrocytes. An enzyme immunoassay showed that the VEGF concentration in corpus callosum was significantly higher up to 7 days after hypoxic exposure. NO levels, measured by colorimetric assay, were also significantly higher in hypoxic rats up to 14 days after hypoxic exposure as compared with the controls. A large number of axons undergoing degeneration were observed between 3 h and 7 days after the hypoxic exposure at electron-microscopic level. Our findings point towards the involvement of excitotoxicity, VEGF and NO in periventricular white matter damage in response to hypoxia.
Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), including stargazin/gamma-2, are associated with AMPA receptors and participate in their surface delivery and anchoring at the postsynaptic membrane. TARPs may also act as a positive modulator of the AMPA receptor ion channel function; however, little is known about other TARP members except for stargazin/gamma-2. We examined the synaptic localization of stargazin/gamma-2 and gamma-8 by immunoelectron microscopy and biochemical analysis. The analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling revealed that stargazin/gamma-2 was concentrated in the postsynaptic area, whereas gamma-8 was distributed both in synaptic and extra-synaptic plasma membranes of the hippocampal neuron. When a synaptic plasma membrane-enriched brain fraction was treated with Triton X-100 and separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, a large proportion of NMDA receptor and stargazin/gamma-2 was accumulated in raft-enriched fractions, whereas AMPA receptor and gamma-8 were distributed in both the raft-enriched fractions and other Triton-insoluble fractions. Phosphorylation of stargazin/gamma-2 and gamma-8 was regulated by different sets of kinases and phosphatases in cultured cortical neurons. These results suggested that stargazin/gamma-2 and gamma-8 have distinct roles in postsynaptic membranes under the regulation of different intracellular signaling pathways.
NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD) involve changes in AMPA receptor activity and postsynaptic localization that are in part controlled by glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit phosphorylation. The scaffolding molecule A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)79/150 targets both the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (PP2B/CaN) to AMPA receptors to regulate GluR1 phosphorylation. Here, we report that brief NMDA receptor activation leads to persistent redistribution of AKAP79/150 and PKA-RII, but not PP2B/CaN, from postsynaptic membranes to the cytoplasm in hippocampal slices. Similar to LTD, AKAP79/150 redistribution requires PP2B/CaN activation and is accompanied by GluR1 dephosphorylation and internalization. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy in hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that PKA anchoring to AKAP79/150 is required for NMDA receptor regulation of PKA-RII localization and that movement of AKAP-PKA complexes underlies PKA redistribution. These findings suggest that LTD involves removal of AKAP79/150 and PKA from synapses in addition to activation of PP2B/CaN. Movement of AKAP79/150-PKA complexes from the synapse could further favor the actions of phosphatases in maintaining dephosphorylation of postsynaptic substrates, such as GluR1, that are important for LTD induction and expression. In addition, our observations demonstrate that AKAPs serve not solely as stationary anchors in cells but also as dynamic signaling components.
The activity-dependent remodeling of postsynaptic structure is a fundamental process underlying learning and memory. Insulin receptor substrate p53 (IRSp53), a key player in cytoskeletal dynamics, is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction, but its significance in synaptic functions remains unclear. We report here that IRSp53 is accumulated rapidly at the postsynaptic sites of cultured hippocampal neurons after glutamate or NMDA stimulation in an actin cytoskeleton-dependent manner. Pharmacological profiles showed that a PKC inhibitor, but not other kinase inhibitors, specifically suppressed the synaptic translocation of IRSp53 in response to NMDA, and the selective activation of PKC with phorbol ester markedly induced the synaptic translocation. Reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blotting showed that IRSp53-S is the major isoform expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. The synaptic targeting of IRSp53-S was found to be mediated through N-terminal coiled-coil domain and the PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1)-binding sequence at its C-terminal end and regulated by the PKC phosphorylation of its N terminus. In electrophysiological experiments, overexpression of IRSp53-S wild type and IRSp53-S mutant that is spontaneously accumulated at the postsynaptic sites enhanced the postsynaptic function as detected by an increased miniature EPSC amplitude. These data suggest that IRSp53 is involved in NMDA receptor-linked synaptic plasticity via PKC signaling.
Postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) is an evolutionarily conserved synaptic adaptor protein that is known to bind many proteins including the NMDA receptor. This observation has implicated it in many NMDA receptor-dependent processes including spatial learning and synaptic plasticity. We have cloned and characterised the murine PSD-95 gene. In addition, we have identified two previously uncharacterised splice variants of the major murine PSD-95 transcript (PSD-95alpha): PSD-95alpha-2b results from an extension of exon 2 and PSD-95alpha-Delta18 from the temporal exclusion of exon 18. The presence of PSD-95alpha-2b sequences in other PSD-95 family members implicates this peptide stretch as functionally significant. Another potential transcript (PSD-95gamma) was also identified based on examination of EST databases. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that proteins corresponding in size to PSD-95alpha-Delta18 and PSD-95gamma interact with the NMDA receptor, suggesting an important biological role for these isoforms. Finally, we have performed bioinformatics analyses of the PSD-95 mRNA untranslated regions, identifying multiple translational control elements that suggest protein production could be regulated post-transcriptionally. The variety of mRNA isoforms and regulatory elements identified provides for a high degree of diversity in the structure and function of PSD-95 proteins.
The specification and organization of glutamatergic synaptic transmission require the coordinated interaction among glutamate receptors and their synaptic adaptor proteins closely assembled in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here we investigated the interaction between NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the integral regulation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and gene expression in cultured rat striatal neurons. We found that coapplication of NMDA and the mGluR5 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine synergistically increased ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, the synergistic increase in ERK phosphorylation was dependent on the cross talk between NMDA receptor-associated synaptic adaptor protein PSD-95 and the mGluR5-linked adaptor protein Homer1b/c but not on the conventional Ca2+ signaling derived from NMDA receptors (Ca2+ influx) and mGluR5 (intracellular Ca2+ release). This was demonstrated by the findings that the synergistic phosphorylation of ERK induced by coactivation of NMDA receptors and mGluR5 was blocked by either a Tat peptide that disrupts NMDA receptor/PSD-95 binding or small interfering RNAs that selectively reduce cellular levels of Homer1b/c. Furthermore, ERK activated through this PSD-95/Homer1b/c-dependent and Ca2+-independent pathway was able to phosphorylate the two key transcription factors Elk-1 and cAMP response element-binding protein, which further leads to facilitation of c-Fos expression. Together, we have identified a novel Ca2+-independent signaling pathway to ERK by the synergistic interaction of NMDA receptors and mGluR5 via their adaptor proteins in the PSD of neurons, which underlies a synapse-to-nucleus communication important for the transcriptional regulation.
Social aggression in the lizard Anolis carolinensis produces dominant and subordinate relationships while elevating corticosterone levels and monoaminergic transmitter activity in hippocampus (medial and mediodorsal cortex). Adaptive social behavior for dominant and subordinate male A. carolinensis is learned during aggressive interaction and therefore was hypothesized to involve hippocampus and regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. To test the effects of social stress and corticosterone on NMDA receptor subunits (NR), male lizards were either paired or given two injections of corticosterone 1 day apart. Paired males were allowed to form dominant-subordinate relationships and were killed 1 day later. Groups included isolated controls, dominant males, subordinate males and males injected with corticosterone. Brains were processed for glutamate receptor subunit immunohistochemistry and fluorescence was analyzed by image analysis for NR(2A) and NR(2B) in the small and large cell divisions of the medial and mediodorsal cortex. In the small granule cell division there were no significant differences in NR(2A) or NR(2B) immunoreactivity among all groups. In contrast, there was a significant upregulation of NR(2A) and NR(2B) subunits in the large pyramidal cell division in all three experimental groups as compared with controls. The results revealed significantly increased NR(2A) and NR(2B) subunits in behaving animals, whereas animals simply injected with corticosterone showed less of an effect, although they were significantly increased over control. Upregulation of NR(2) subunits occurs during stressful social interactions and is likely to be regulated in part by glucocorticoids. The data also suggest that learning social roles during stressful aggressive interactions may involve NMDA receptor-mediated mechanisms.
Previous work found evidence that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors interact with and are functionally regulated by the glycosaminoglycan heparin. The present study tested whether dextran species affect ligand binding, channel kinetics, and calcium permeability of AMPA receptors. Dextran sulfate of 500 kDa markedly reduced high affinity [3H]AMPA binding in solubilized hippocampal membranes. In isolated receptors reconstituted in a lipid bilayer, the same dextran sulfate prolonged the lifetime of open states exhibited by AMPA-induced channel fluctuations. The large polysaccharide further changed the single channel kinetics by increasing the open channel probability five- to sixfold. Such modulation of channel activity corresponded with enhanced levels of calcium influx as shown in hippocampal neurons loaded with Fluo3AM dye. With an exposure time of &lt;1 min, AMPA produced a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium that was blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium (CNQX). Dextran sulfate, at the same concentration range that modified ligand binding (EC50 of 5-10 nM), enhanced the AMPA-induced calcium influx by as much as 60%. The enhanced influx was blocked by CNQX, although unchanged by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist AP5. Confocal microscopy showed that the increase in calcium occurred in neuronal cell bodies and their processes. Interestingly, smaller 5-8-kDa dextran sulfate and a non-sulfated dextran of 500 kDa had little or no effect on the binding, channel, and calcium permeability properties. Together, these findings suggest that synaptic polysaccharide species modulate hippocampal AMPA receptors in a sulfate- and size-dependent manner.
Chemokines constitute a large family of structurally-related small cytokines originally identified as factors regulating the migration of leukocytes in inflammatory and immune responses. Production of chemokines and their receptors in the brain has been reported under various pathological conditions. We revealed that mRNA expression for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), members of the CC chemokines, was induced in the rat brain after focal cerebral ischemia, and that intracerebroventricular injection of viral macrophage inflammatory protein-II (vMIP-II), a broad-spectrum chemokine receptor antagonist, reduced infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that brain chemokines are involved in ischemic injury, and that chemokine receptors are potential targets for therapeutic intervention in stroke. Another potential target to suppress the harmful effect of chemokines is the signal transmission system(s) regulating the chemokine production. However, very little is known about how the production of chemokines is regulated in the ischemic brain. We examined the induction of MCP-1 production by excitotoxic injury via activation of NMDA receptors in the cortico-striatal slice cultures, and found that excitotoxic injury induced MCP-1 production in the slice culture. Almost all of the MCP-1 immunoreactivity was located on astrocytes. On the other hand, NMDA-treatment failed to increase the MCP-1 production in the enriched astrocyte cultures, indicating that NMDA dose not directly act on astrocytes. Some signal(s) is likely sent from the injured neurons to astrocytes to induce the MCP-1 production. These results showed that organotypic slice cultures are useful to investigate the molecular mechanism regulating the chemokine production in the injured brain.
The NMDA receptor represents a particularly important site of ethanol action in the CNS. We recently reported that NMDA receptor 2B (NR2B) gene expression was persistently up-regulated following chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment. Increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in dynamic and long-lasting regulation of gene expression in multiple neuroadaptive processes prompted us to investigate the role of DNA methylation in mediating CIE-induced up-regulation of NR2B gene transcription. To dissect the changes of DNA methylation in the NR2B gene, we have screened a large number of CpG sites within its 5'-regulatory area following CIE treatment.
Primary cortical cultured neurons were subjected to ethanol treatment in a CIE paradigm. Bisulfite conversion followed by pyrosequencing was used for quantitative measurement and analysis of CpG methylation status within the 5'-regulatory area of the NR2B gene; chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to examine DNA levels associated with methylation and transcription factor binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and in vitro DNA methylation assays were performed to determine the direct impact of DNA methylation on the interaction between DNA and transcription factor and promoter activity.
Analysis of individual CpG methylation sites within the NR2B 5'regulatory area revealed three regions with clusters of site-specific CpG demethylation following CIE treatment and withdrawal. This was confirmed by ChIP showing similar decreases of methylated DNA in the same regions. The CIE-induced demethylation is characterized by being located near certain transcription factor binding sequences, AP-1 and CRE, and occurred during treatment as well as after ethanol withdrawal. Furthermore, the increase in vitro of methylated DNA decreased transcription factor binding activity and promoter activity. An additional ChIP assay indicated that the CIE-induced DNA demethylation is accompanied by increased occupation by transcription factors.
These results suggest an important role of DNA demethylation in mediating CIE-induced NR2B gene up-regulation, thus implicating a novel molecular site of alcohol action.
This article provides an overview of present knowledge regarding the relationship between the cholinergic system and sigma-1 receptors, and discusses potential applications of sigma-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of memory deficits and cognitive disorders. Sigma-1 receptors, initially considered as a subtype of the opioid family, are unique ligand-regulated molecular chaperones in the endoplasmatic reticulum playing a modulatory role in intracellular calcium signaling and in the activity of several neurotransmitter systems, particularly the cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Several central nervous system (CNS) drugs show high to moderate affinities for sigma-1 receptors, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil), antipsychotics (haloperidol, rimcazole), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluvoxamine, sertraline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (clorgyline). These compounds can influence cognitive functions both via their primary targets and by activating sigma-1 receptors in the CNS. Sigma-1 agonists show powerful anti-amnesic and neuroprotective effects in a large variety of animal models of cognitive dysfunction involving, among others (i) pharmacologic target blockade (with muscarinic or NMDA receptor antagonists or p-chloroamphetamine); (ii) selective lesioning of cholinergic neurons; (iii) CNS administration of β-amyloid peptides; (iv) aging-induced memory loss, both in normal and senescent-accelerated rodents; (v) neurodegeneration induced by toxic compounds (CO, trimethyltin, cocaine), and (vi) prenatal restraint stress.
Pannexins are large-pore ion channels with broad expression in the central nervous system (CNS). The channels function by releasing large signaling molecules, such ATP and arachidonic acid derivatives, from neurons and possibly astrocytes. They might also contribute to novel forms of non-synaptic communication in the CNS, thereby affecting synaptic function, astrocytic Ca(2+) wave propagation and possibly regulation of vascular tone in the brain. Panx1 activation in various in vitro pathological conditions implicates these channels in ischemic, excitotoxic and ATP-dependent cell death, whereas Panx coupling with purinergic receptors triggers the inflammasome. Novel functions for the pannexin channels are likely to be discovered as current understanding of how they are regulated in physiological and pathological situations improves.
Disruption of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a network of scaffold proteins located in dendritic spines, is thought to be responsible for synaptic dysfunction and loss in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extending our previous demonstration that derangement of the PSD by soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) involves proteasomal degradation of PSD-95, a protein important for ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking, we now show that Abeta also disrupts two other scaffold proteins, Homer1b and Shank1, that couple PSD-95 with ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Treatment of fronto-cortical neurons with soluble Abeta results in rapid (within 1 h) and significant thinning of the PSD, decreased synaptic levels of Homer1b and Shank1, and reduced synaptic mGluR1 levels. We show that de novo protein synthesis is required for the declustering effects of Abeta on Homer1b (but not Shank1) and that, in contrast to PSD-95, Abeta-induced Homer1b and Shank1 cluster disassembly does not depend on proteasome activity. The regulation of Homer1b and Shank1 by Abeta diverges in two other respects: i) whereas the activity of both NMDAR and VDCC is required for Abeta-induced declustering of Homer1b, Abeta-induced declustering of Shank1 only requires NMDAR activity; and ii) whereas the effects of Abeta on Homer1b involve engagement of the PI-3K pathway and calcineurin phosphatase (PP2B) activity, those on Shank1 involve activation of the ERK pathway. In summary, soluble Abeta recruits discrete signalling pathways to rapidly reduce the synaptic localization of major components of the PSD and to regulate the availability of mGluR1 in the synapse.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a neuronal immediate early gene that is regulated by N-methyl d aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. COX-2 enzymatic activity catalyzes the first committed step in prostaglandin synthesis. Recent studies demonstrate an emerging role for the downstream PGE(2) EP2 receptor in diverse models of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and a significant function in models of neurological disease including cerebral ischemia, Familial Alzheimer's disease, and Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Little is known, however, about the normal function of the EP2 receptor in behavior and cognition. Here we report that deletion of the EP2 receptor leads to significant cognitive deficits in standard tests of fear and social memory. EP2-/- mice also demonstrated impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI) and heightened anxiety, but normal startle reactivity, exploratory behavior, and spatial reference memory. This complex behavioral phenotype of EP2-/- mice was associated with a deficit in long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampus. Our findings suggest that PGE(2) signaling via the EP2 receptors plays an important role in cognitive and emotional behaviors that recapitulate some aspects of human psychopathology related to schizophrenia.
It has been shown that wake (W) and slow wave sleep (SWS) modulate synaptic transmission in neocortical projections. However the impact of paradoxical sleep (PS) quantities on synaptic transmission remains unknown. We examined whether PS modulated the excitatory transmission and expression of glutamate receptor subtypes and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK1/2).
PS deprivation (PSD) was carried out with the multiple platforms method on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. LTP, late-LTP, and synaptic transmission were studied in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of controls, 75-h PSD and 150-min PS rebound (PSR). GluR1 and NR1 protein and mRNA expression were evaluated by western blot and real-time PCR. p-ERK1/2 level was quantified by western blot and immunohistochemistry.
PSD decreased synaptic transmission and LTP selectively in dorsal CA1 and PSR rescued these deficits. PSD-induced synaptic modifications in CA1 were associated with a decrease in GluR1, NR1, and p-ERK1/2 levels in dorsal CA1 without change in GluR1 and NR1 mRNA expression. Regression analysis shows that LTP is positively correlated with both PS quantities and SWS episodes duration, whereas synaptic transmission and late-LTP are positively correlated with PS quantities and negatively correlated with SWS quantities.
These findings unveil previously unrecognized roles of PSD on synaptic transmission and LTP in the dorsal, but not in the ventral, hippocampus. The fact that the decrease in protein expression of GluR1 and NR1 was not associated with a change in mRNA expression of these receptors suggests that a sleep-induced modulation of translational mechanisms occurs in dorsal CA1.
The molecular events mediating the complex interaction between exercise and cognition are not well-understood. Although many aspects of the signal transduction pathways mediate exercise induced improvement in cognition are elucidated, little is known about the molecular events interrelating physiological stress with synaptic proteins, following physical exercise. Small heat shock proteins (sHSP), HSP27 and alpha-B-crystallin are co-localized to synapses and astrocytes, but their role in the brain is not well-understood. We investigated whether their levels in the hippocampus were modulated by exercise, using a well characterized voluntary exercise paradigm. Since sHSP are known to be regulated by many intracellular signaling molecules in other cells types outside the brain, we investigated whether similar regulation may serve a role in the brain by measuring protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), pGSK3 and the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and phospho-c-Jun kinase (pJNK). Results demonstrated exercise-dependent increases in HSP27 and alpha-B-crystallin levels. We observed that increases in sHSP coincided with robust elevations in the presynaptic protein, SNAP25 and the post-synaptic proteins NR2b and PSD95. Exercise had a differential impact on kinases, significantly reducing pAkt and pERK, while increasing p38 MAPK. In conclusion, we demonstrate four early novel hippocampal responses to exercise that have not been identified previously: the induction of (1) sHSPs (2) the synaptic proteins SNAP-25, NR2b, and PSD-95, (3) the MAP kinase p38 and (4) the immediate early gene product MKP1. We speculate that sHSP may play a role in synaptic plasticity in response to exercise.
Importins, also called karyopherins, belong to a large family of proteins involved in cytoplasm-to-nucleus transport. Transport machinery generally involves a complex formed by two different importin subtypes (alpha and beta). Both alpha and beta importins are expressed in the brain, and their expression and localization is regulated by physiological neuronal activity. Little is known about regulation of importin expression in brain pathological conditions. Here we studied the expression of importin beta1 (imp beta 1) in the rat hippocampus after acute and chronic seizures induced by the glutamate agonist kainic acid (KA). The overall content of imp beta 1 mRNA and protein did not change after acute KA seizures. However, acute KA seizures rapidly induced the translocation of imp beta 1 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in pyramidal CA1 neurons. KA-induced imp beta 1 translocation was prevented by the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptor blocker MK-801. After chronic seizures, the overall levels of imp beta 1 mRNA and protein did not change in the whole hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry revealed a massive loss of imp beta 1-positive neurons in pyramidal layers (that degenerated after KA), whereas an increased number of imp beta 1-positive cells was detected in the stratum radiatum of rats with chronic seizures compared with control animals. Double-labeling experiments identified these cells as glial cells expressing the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 (neuron/glial antigen 2), a glial subtype recently shown to regulate hippocampal neuron excitability. These data show a differential regulation of imp beta 1 expression after acute and chronic seizure activity in the rat hippocampus.
Exposure to ethanol early in life can have long-lasting implications on brain function and drug of abuse response later in life. The present study investigated in rats, the long-term consequences of pre- and postnatal (early life) ethanol exposure on drug consumption/reward and the molecular targets potentially associated with these behavioral alterations. Since a relationship has been demonstrated between heightened drugs intake and susceptibility to drugs-induced locomotor activity/sensitization, anxiolysis, we tested these behavioral responses, depending on the drug, in control and early life ethanol-exposed animals. Our results show that progeny exposed to early life ethanol displayed increased consumption of ethanol solutions and increased sensitivity to cocaine rewarding effects assessed in the conditioned place preference test. Offspring exposed to ethanol were more sensitive to the anxiolytic effect of ethanol and the increased sensitivity could, at least in part, explain the alteration in the consumption of ethanol for its anxiolytic effects. In addition, the sensitivity to hypothermic effects of ethanol and ethanol metabolism were not altered by early life ethanol exposure. The sensitization to cocaine (20 mg/kg) and to amphetamine (1.2 mg/kg) was increased after early life ethanol exposure and, could partly explain, an increase in the rewarding properties of psychostimulants. Gene expression analysis revealed that expression of a large number of genes was altered in brain regions involved in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. Dopaminergic receptors and transporter binding sites were also down-regulated in the striatum of ethanol-exposed offspring. Such long-term neurochemical alterations in transmitter systems and in the behavioral responses to ethanol and other drugs of abuse may confer an increased liability for addiction in exposed offspring.
Regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity by desensitization is important in physiological and pathological states; NMDAR desensitization contributes in shaping synaptic responses and may be protective by limiting calcium influx during sustained glutamate insults. We previously reported that glycine-independent desensitization decreases during hippocampal neuronal development, correlating with NMDAR synaptic localization and association with postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95). PSD-95/Discs large/zona occludens (PDZ)-1,2 domains of PSD-95 bind to the C-terminus of NMDAR NR2 subunits. The role of PSD-95 in anchoring signaling proteins near NMDARs is well documented. To determine if PSD-95-induced changes in NMDAR desensitization occur because of direct binding to NR2 or due to recruitment of regulatory proteins, we tested the effects of various PSD-95 constructs on NMDAR currents in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and neurons. In HEK cells, wild-type PSD-95 significantly reduced wild-type NMDAR desensitization without altering currents of NMDARs containing NR2A-S1462A, a mutation that abolishes PSD-95 binding. The PSD-95 N-terminus truncated after the PDZ1-2 domains was sufficient for this effect in neurons with low endogenous PSD-95 levels; in NMDAR-expressing HEK cells, the effect persisted when PSD-95 multimerization was eliminated. Moreover other PSD-95 family members with highly homologous PDZ1-2 domains significantly reduced NMDAR desensitization. In mature neurons, disruption of PSD-95/NMDAR interaction through protein kinase C (PKC) activation increased desensitization to levels found in immature neurons, and this effect was not due to PKC direct regulation of NMDAR activity. We conclude that direct binding of PSD-95 increases stability of NMDAR responses to agonist exposure in neuronal and nonneuronal cells.
Lipid rafts (LR) are lipid microdomains present in the cell surface membrane that are organizational platforms involved in protein trafficking and formation of cell signaling complexes. In the adult brain, NMDA receptors (NMDAR) and receptor-associated proteins such as membrane-associated guanylate kinases (PSD-95 and SAP102), are distributed between the postsynaptic density (PSD) and lipid rafts. However, the time course of the association of NMDAR with LR during neural development is not known. We therefore investigated the effect of development on the association of NMDAR with LR prepared from rat brains ranging in postnatal age from 1-35 days and compared this with their expression in PSDs. LR and PSD fractions were prepared by extraction of P2 membranes with Tx-100 followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The yield of LR, as reflected by levels of protein, Thy-1, and flotillin-1 increased during postnatal development. NR2A was associated predominantly with the lipid raft fraction at all ages examined whereas NR2B underwent a gradual shift from PSDs to lipid rafts during the first 3 weeks after birth. These changes in the distribution of NR2A and NR2B were paralleled by changes in the distribution of PSD-95 and SAP102 respectively. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including NR2A and NR2B, were preferentially associated with lipid rafts in older, as compared to younger, animals. These results show that the association of NMDAR with LR is regulated developmentally.
In much of the developing nervous system, electrical activity guides the formation of neural connections, with lasting effects on adult brain function. Epilepsy, a defect in neuronal excitability, might result from abnormal patterns of activity in the young brain. Many connections are organized by selective stabilization of synapses when they are activated simultaneously on the same postsynaptic cell during a sensitive period in early life. This process often involves calcium entry through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. The magnitude of the current passed by this receptor depends on its subunit composition, which varies with age and brain region. Although receptor configurations that admit large calcium currents are permissive of synaptic plasticity, they also increase neural vulnerability to excitotoxic cell death. In most regions of developing brain, activity that can drive NMDA receptors initially is low and increases with maturation. Thus, the replacement of NMDA receptors that flux large calcium currents during early periods of synaptic organization with NMDA receptor subtypes that flux less calcium as synapses become more active, more effective, and less plastic allows maturing neurons to maintain optimal levels of intracellular calcium in the face of drastic developmental changes in their inputs. We have proposed that this transition in NMDA receptors from high to low calcium permeabilities is itself activity dependent. This idea is supported by data showing that many synaptic proteins, including receptor subunits, can be regulated by activity. Cultured cerebellar granule neurons require NMDA receptor stimulation for survival and differentiation, which may replicate the activation provided by the arrival of mossy fiber innervation in vivo. In these cultures, chronic depolarization and glutamate or NMDA treatment induces more mature NMDA receptor subunit expression patterns and function and also increases the expression of several gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunits, changing that receptor's function. In addition, evidence from in vivo studies indicates that synaptic maturation itself may depend on NMDA receptor activity. During the formation of topographic connections between the retina and superior colliculus (SC) of young rats, chronic local application of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist +2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV) blocks the normal developmental up-regulation of NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1) mRNA and nitric oxide synthase activity, as well as maturation of calcium and calmodulin-dependent kinase distribution, activity, and substrate phosphorylation. Together, these recent molecular findings suggest that chronic seizure disorders could result from any of a variety of early developmental events. Any disturbance that locally perturbs regulation of NMDA receptors or the temporal correlations in synaptic activity that drive these receptors has the potential to alter the normal development of local circuitry and the critical balance of inhibition and excitation required to contain seizure activity.
Although it is well established that cortical and hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons generally have large numbers of Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate channels (Ca-A/K channels), their presence on pyramidal neurons is controversial. Ca2+ permeability of AMPA channels is regulated by expression of a particular glutamate receptor subunit (GluR2), which confers Ca2+ impermeability to heteromeric channels. Most electrophysiology studies, as well as in situ hybridization and immunolabeling studies demonstrating expression of GluR2 mRNA or peptide in pyramidal neurons, have provided evidence against the presence of Ca-A/K channels on pyramidal neurons. However, observations that pyramidal neurons often appear to be labeled by kainate-stimulated Co2+ influx (Co2+(+) cells), a histochemical stain that identifies cells possessing Ca-A/K channels, suggests that they may have these channels. The present study futher examines cellular and subcellular distribution of Ca-A/K channels on hippocampal pyramidal neurons in slice as well as in culture. To this end, techniques of kainate-stimulated Co2+ influx labeling, supplemented by AMPA receptor subunit immunocytochemistry and fluorescent imaging of kainate-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) rises are employed. Co2+ labeling is often seen in pyramidal neuronal dendrites in both slice and in culture. In addition, although GluR1 and 4 staining in these neurons is often seen in the soma and dendrites, GluR2 label, when evident, is generally more restricted to the soma. Finally, measurement of kainate-stimulated [Ca2+]i rises in cultured neurons, assessed by using low affinity Ca2+ indicators in the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel blockade, often shows dendritic rises to precede those in the somata. Thus, these data support the hypothesis that Ca-A/K channels are present in dendritic domains of many pyramidal neurons, and may help to provide resolution of the apparently conflicting data regarding their distribution.
The studies discussed in this review demonstrate that phosphorylation is an important mechanism for the regulation of ligand-gated ion channels. Structurally, ligand-gated ion channels are heteromeric proteins comprised of homologous subunits. For both the AChR and the GABA(A) receptor, each subunit has a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains, a large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains M3 and M4, and an extracellular C-terminal domain (Fig. 1B). All the phosphorylation sites on these receptors have been mapped to the major intracellular loop between M3 and M4 (Table 1). In contrast, glutamate receptors appear to have a very large extracellular N-terminal domain, one membrane hairpin loop, three transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop between transmembrane domains M3 and M4, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Fig. 1C). Most phosphorylation sites on glutamate receptors have been shown to be on the intracellular C-terminal domain, although some have been suggested to be on the putative extracellular loop between M3 and M4 (Table 1). A variety of extracellular factors and intracellular signal transduction cascades are involved in regulating phosphorylation of these ligand-gated ion channels (Fig. 2). Once again, the AChR at the neuromuscular junction is the most fully understood system. Phosphorylation of the AChR by PKA is stimulated synaptically by the neuropeptide CGRP and in an autocrine fashion by adenosine released from the muscle in response to acetylcholine. In addition, acetylcholine, via calcium influx through the AChR, appears to activate calcium-dependent kinases including PKC to stimulate serine phosphorylation of the receptor. Presently, agrin is the only extracellular factor known to stimulate phosphorylation of the AChR on tyrosine residues. For glutamate receptors, non-NMDA receptor phosphorylation by PKA is stimulated by dopamine, while NMDA receptor phosphorylation by PKA and PKC can be induced via the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, and metabotropic glutamate or opioid receptors, respectively. In addition, Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor has been shown to activate PKC. CaMKII, and calcineurin, resulting in phosphorylation of AMPA receptors (by CaMKII) and inactivation of NMDA receptors (at least in part through calcineurin). In contrast to the AChR and glutamate receptors, no information is presently available regarding the identities of the extracellular factors and intracellular signal transduction cascades that regulate phosphorylation of the GABA(A) receptor. Surely, future studies will be aimed at further clarifying the molecular mechanisms by which the central receptors are regulated. The presently understood functional effects of ligand-gated ion channel phosphorylation are diverse. At the neuromuscular junction, a regulation of the AChR desensitization rate by both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation has been demonstrated. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR or other synaptic components appears to play a role in AChR clustering during synaptogenesis. For the GABA(A) receptor, the data are complex. Both activation and inhibition of GABA(A) receptor currents as a result of PKA and PKC phosphorylation have been reported, while phosphorylation by PTK enhances function. The predominant effect of glutamate receptor phosphorylation by a variety of kinases is a potentiation of the peak current response. However, PKC also modulates clustering of NMDA receptors. This complexity in the regulation of ligand-gated ion channels by phosphorylation provides diverse mechanisms for mediating synaptic plasticity. In fact, accumulating evidence supports the involvement of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors in LTP and LTD respectively. There has been a dramatic increase in our understanding of the nature by which phosphorylation regulates ligand-gated ion channels. However, many questions remain unanswered. (AB
Pharmacologically induced stereotypies (PHIS) following dopamine agonists and, more recently, the non-competitive NMDA antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801), are used to study human psychopathology and for screening potential neuroleptic drugs. On the other hand, bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) spontaneously develop stereotyped jumping in barren cages, already before the age of 1 month (= captivity-induced stereotypies or CIS). Large interindividual differences in the level of jumping exist. In this study, the effect of MK-801 on various behaviours of bank voles, and in particular the relationship between CIS and PHIS, was investigated by repeated administration of MK-801 to stereotyping (ST) and non-stereotyping (NST) voles. The animals received nine daily s.c. injections of, respectively, saline and 0.3 mg/kg MK-801, with a 48-h break between both treatments. Their behaviour was visually recorded every 4 days. The results showed that jumping was neither evoked in NST, nor intensified in ST. Instead, in both ST and NST, PHIS consisting of intensive sniffing and locomotor stereotypy characterised by running in unidirectional circles were elicited. Furthermore, ST showed behavioural sensitisation for locomotor stereotypy, while in NST intensive sniffing was progressively enhanced. These results suggest that CIS and PHIS induced by MK-801 in bank voles are regulated, at least in part, by different neuronal mechanisms and that ST and NST could be predisposed to develop more easily one given PHIS than the other.
1. The whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to record from Golgi cells in thin slices of the rat cerebellum (P12-P25). Their active membrane properties and the input that they receive from the parallel fibres were characterized. 2. Most cells were filled with biocytin and morphologically identified by the presence of a large axonal arbor restricted to the granular layer. The morphological parameters of eighteen of the best-preserved cells were quantified. 3. A slow capacitive current transient, characteristic of the Golgi cell axon, was used to identify Golgi cells whenever their morphology could not be preserved. 4. Golgi cells fire action potentials spontaneously at 3 +/- 1.7 Hz (n = 17). Their firing frequency increases linearly with the amplitude of depolarizing current pulses and displays marked adaptation. 5. When hyperpolarized Golgi cells display an anomalous rectification which is blocked by 2 mM CsCl, indicating the presence of an Ih-like current. 6. Golgi cells receive a spontaneous excitatory input from parallel fibres. This input is composed of small amplitude, mostly monoquantal, EPSCs. Chemical stimulation of granule cells by locally applied kainate evokes tetrodotoxin (TTX)-dependent events with similar properties. 7. The parallel fibre-Golgi cell EPSCs have both AMPA and NMDA components. The NMDA component is blocked by 1 mM external magnesium at -60 mV and decays with time constants of 31 +/- 9 ms and 170 +/- 15 ms (at +61 mV in the presence of magnesium). 8. In the presence of 10 microM internal spermine, the AMPA component of the spontaneous EPSCs is markedly slowed (0.96 +/- 0.25 ms to 1.86 +/- 0.47 ms; n = 4) and reduced in amplitude (49 +/- 7 %; n = 4) when depolarizing the cell from -70 mV to +61 mV. 9. The decay kinetics of individual AMPA EPSCs were found to be variable, in part because of dendritic filtering. A more detailed analysis reveals that the synaptic AMPA conductances are regulated during development and close faster at days P19-P25 than at days P13-P16.10. These data suggest that the efficacy of the parallel fibre-Golgi cell input is rather low. This places strong constraints on the conditions in which the inhibitory feedback exerted by the Golgi cell can be operational.11. The possibility is considered that the Golgi cell-granule cell circuit shows an oscillatory behaviour. This hypothesis is discussed in relation to the models of Albus and Marr.
Pancreatic beta cells (insulin-producing cells) and neuronal cells share a large number of similarities. Here, we investigate whether the same mechanisms could control the expression of neuronal genes in both neurons and insulin-producing cells. For that purpose, we tested the role of the transcriptional repressor neuron-restrictive silencing factor/repressor element silencing transciption factor (NRSF/REST) in the expression of a battery of neuronal genes in insulin-producing cells. NRSF/REST is a negative regulator of the neuronal fate. It is known to silence neuronal-specific genes in non-neuronal cells. We demonstrate that, as in the case of the neuronal pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, mRNA coding for NRSF/REST is absent from the insulinoma cell line INS-1 and from three other insulin- and glucagon-producing cell lines. NRSF/REST activity is also absent from insulin-producing cell lines. Transient expression of REST in insulin-producing cell lines is sufficient to silence a reporter gene containing a NRSF/REST binding site, demonstrating the role of NRSF/REST in the expression of neuronal markers in insulin-producing cells. Finally, by searching for the expression of NRSF/REST-regulated genes in insulin-producing cells, we increased the list of the genes expressed in both neurons and insulin-producing cells.
Touch evoked agitation (allodynia) can be induced by spinal delivery of strychnine and this effect is antagonized by intrathecal NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists, but not by mu-opiate receptor agonists. In this study, we sought to characterize the effect of focal glycine-receptor inhibition on spontaneous and evoked activity in dorsal horn neurons of the chloralose-anesthetized cat. Strychnine (1 mM) applied near the neurons through a dialysis fiber caused an enhanced response to hair deflection, enlargement of the low threshold receptive fields and in some cells, an increase in afterdischarge. These changes were observed only in cells that were activated by both hair deflection and high intensity mechanical stimulation. Subsequent co-administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist (AP-7, 2.0 mM) preferentially blocked strychnine-associated effects without changing the original receptive field characteristics. Co-administration of a non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist (CNQX, 1 mM) with the strychnine served to block low (brush) and high intensity (pinch) afferent input. In contrast, addition of a mu-opiate receptor agonist (alfentanil 2.4 mM) to the strychnine perfusate selectively reduced responsiveness to high intensity stimulation, while having no effect on the exaggerated response to hair deflection. Given the functional and pharmacological similarity of the effects of spinal strychnine to post-nerve injury states in man, disinhibition due to a loss of glycinergic input may be associated with large myelinated fiber-mediated nociceptive states. Consistent with these data is the contention that under normal circumstances, afferent hair follicle input onto convergent neurons is regulated by a tonic glycinergic circuit. Removal of this regulatory influence leads to a magnification of low threshold tactile throughput in dorsal horn. This model may help to provide pharmacological insights into more efficacious treatments for such pain states that are relatively refractory to opioid therapies.
Homosynaptic long-term depression and long-term potentiation were studied in hippocampal slices from 12-18-day-old rats using field excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in the CA1 subfield (stratum radiatum). Independent estimates of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential were obtained in parallel using early and late measurements of a dual component excitatory postsynaptic potential in a solution containing low (0.1 mM) magnesium and 1 microM of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Long-term depression, induced by 2 Hz stimulation for 10 min, was observed as an equal relative depression of the AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential, whereas long-term potentiation induced by single or repeated high-frequency stimulation, was seen initially as a predominant potentiation of the AMPA receptor-mediated component. Within the first 30-60 min, long-term potentiation gradually changed to more equal increases of the two components of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. During alternating induction of long-term depression and long-term potentiation, the AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components could both be repeatedly regulated up and down. Long-term depression and long-term potentiation also showed several signs of interaction with each other during such experiments; e.g., long-term depression removed the occlusive effect of large long-term potentiation on a subsequent long-term potentiation, and long-term potentiation applied after the induction of long-term depression was found to be more stable than otherwise. The results support the notion that long-term depression and long-term potentiation employ changes in a common synaptic property. A tentative mechanism for this modification, expressed as equal changes of AMPA and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated components of the excitatory postsynaptic potential, is an alteration in transmitter release, while the initial asymmetric part of long-term potentiation indicates involvement of an additional short-term modification.
Using spinal cord slices prepared from neonatal rats, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in neurons located in the dorsal horn substantia gelatinosa (SG) was measured with microscopic fluorometry by loading fura 2-AM into neurons. Developmental alterations in the elevation of [Ca2+]i elicited by the glutamate analogs, NMDA and AMPA, were investigated from postnatal day (PNDs) 1 to 17. During the 1st week of postnatal life, when neuronal maturation of the SG is known to take place, the NMDA response remained large or even slightly increased. It subsequently showed a gradual decline. This pattern of postnatal changes is consistent with previously reported autoradiographic studies on NMDA-binding sites. The affinity of receptors for NMDA was found to decrease constantly during the period examined. The AMPA response and resting [Ca2+]i showed no significant developmental changes. Neonatal treatment with capsaicin, which has been shown to degenerate fine primary afferent fibers terminating in the SG, delayed the developmental decline in the NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i response. It is suggested that the number and the molecular properties of NMDA receptors expressed in the SG change during early postnatal neuronal maturation. The temporal coincidence between postnatal alteration in NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i elevation and neuronal maturation of the SG may indicate that intracellular Ca2+ regulated by NMDA receptor activation is related to postnatal neuronal maturation. Activation of fine primary afferent fibers may contribute to the observed developmental alterations in the NMDA response of SG neurons.
Glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Systemic injection of kainic acid (KA) in the rat produces an animal model of human temporal lobe epilepsy. We examined the temporal expression of the sodium-dependent neuronal glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1), in KA-induced rat epilepsy. As an early alteration, perinuclear deposits of EAAC1 protein were found mainly in the large pyramidal neurons at the hippocampus, neocortex, piriform cortex, and amygdala with the reduction of neuropil staining 6 hours after KA injection. Immunoelectron microscopic study revealed that the perinuclear EAAC1 immunoreactivity corresponded to the translocation to the Golgi complex. At this time point, EAAC1 mRNA was down-regulated. The intracellular aggregation of EAAC1 primarily disappeared by 24 hours. In vitro studies indicated that internalization of EAAC1 from the plasma membrane to the intracellular compartment by KA treatment was associated with the reduction of electrogenic transporter currents. Our results suggest that the transient EAAC1 internalization participates in the modulation of the transporter function preventing excessive glutamate uptake to pyramidal neurons during the early stage of epilepsy.
Delta-catenin (or neural plakophilin-related arm-repeat protein/neurojungin) is primarily a brain specific member of the p120(ctn) subfamily of armadillo/beta-catenin proteins that play important roles in neuronal development. Our previous studies have shown that the ectopic expression of delta-catenin induces the formation of dendrite-like extensions and that the overexpression of delta-catenin promotes dendritic branching and increases spine density. Here we demonstrate that delta-catenin displays a dendritic distribution pattern in the adult mouse brain and is co-enriched with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) in the detergent insoluble postsynaptic scaffolds. Delta-catenin forms stable complexes with excitatory neurotransmitter receptors including ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 2A (NR2A), metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha (mGluR1alpha), as well as PSD-95 in vivo. In cultured primary embryonic neurons, delta-catenin clusters co-distribute with filamentous actin and resist detergent extraction. In dissociated hippocampal neurons overexpressing delta-catenin, glutamate stimulation leads to a rapid redistribution of delta-catenin that can be attenuated by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and dizocilpine, selective inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Upon glutamate receptor activation, delta-catenin becomes down-regulated and its association with NR2A and mGluR1alpha in cultured neurons is diminished. These findings support a possible functional connection between delta-catenin and the glutamatergic excitatory synaptic signaling pathway during neuronal development.
Development and maintenance of whisker-specific patterns along the rodent trigeminal pathway depends on an intact sensory periphery during the sensitive/critical period in development. Barrelette cells of the brain stem trigeminal nuclei are the first set of neurons to develop whisker-specific patterns. Those in the principal sensory nucleus (PrV) relay these patterns to the ventrobasal thalamus, and consequently, to the somatosensory cortex. Thus PrV barrelette cells are among the first group of central neurons susceptible to the effects of peripheral damage. Previously we showed that membrane properties of barrelette cells are distinct as early as postnatal day 1 (PND 1) and remain unchanged following peripheral denervation in newborn rat pups (Lo and Erzurumlu 2001). In the present study, we investigated the changes in synaptic transmission. In barrelette cells of normal PND 1 rats, weak stimulation of the trigeminal tract (TrV) that was subthreshold for inducing Na(+) spikes evoked an excitatory postsynaptic potential-inhibitory postsynaptic potential (EPSP-IPSP) sequence that was similar to the responses seen in older rats (Lo et al. 1999). Infraorbital nerve transection at birth did not alter excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections of the barrelette cells. These observations suggested that local neuronal circuits are already established in PrV at birth and remain intact after deafferentation. Strong stimulation of the TrV induced a sustained depolarization (plateau potential) in denervated but not in normal barrelette neurons. The plateau potential was distinct from the EPSP-IPSP sequence by 1) a sustained (&gt;80 ms) depolarization above -40 mV; 2) a slow decline slope (&lt;0.1 mV/ms); 3) partially or totally inactivated Na(+) spikes on the plateau; and 4) a termination by a steep decay (&gt;1 mV/ms) to a hyperpolarizing membrane level. The plateau potential was mediated by L-type Ca(2+) channels and triggered by a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated EPSP. gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated IPSP dynamically regulated the latency and duration of the plateau potential. These results indicate that after neonatal peripheral damage, central trigeminal inputs cause a large and long-lasting Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels in barrelette neurons. Increased Ca(2+) entry may play a key role in injury-induced structural remodeling, and/or transsynaptic cell death.
It has been recognized for some years that a prolonged Ca(2+) elevation that is predictive of impending cell death develops in cultured neurons following excitotoxic insult. In addition, neurons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to excitotoxic insult with increasing age in culture. However, little is known about the processes that selectively regulate the post-insult Ca(2+) elevation and therefore, it remains unclear whether it is associated specifically with age-dependent toxicity.Here, we tested the hypothesis that a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist selectively modulates the prolonged Ca(2+) elevation in direct association with its protective effects against excitotoxicity. Rat hippocampal cultures of two ages (8-9 and 21-28 days in vitro) were exposed to a 5-min glutamate insult (400 microM in younger and 10 microM in older cultures) sufficient to kill &gt;50% of the neurons, and were treated with vehicle or the specific group I metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist 1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA; 1 mM), throughout and following the insult. Neuronal survival was quantified 24 h after insult. In parallel studies, neurons of similar age in culture were imaged ratiometrically with a confocal microscope during and for 60 min after the glutamate insult. A large post-insult Ca(2+) elevation was present in older but not most younger neurons. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801, blocked the Ca(2+) elevation both during and following the insult. In contrast, AIDA blocked only the post-insult prolonged Ca(2+) elevation in older neurons. Moreover, AIDA was neuroprotective in older but not younger cultures. From these results we suggest that the post-insult Ca(2+) elevation is regulated differently from the Ca(2+) elevation during glutamate insult and is modulated by group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. Further, the prolonged Ca(2+) elevation appears to be directly linked to an age-dependent component of vulnerability.
This article extends our initial investigation of the interactions between dopamine and glutamate receptor systems after acute exposure to ethanol. DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein of approximate molecular weight 32 kDa) is an important regulator of protein phosphatase-1 that in turn regulates a large number of effectors, including the NMDA receptor.
We measured the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. Initially, corpus striatum was assayed after intraperitoneal treatment of mice with the D1 agonist SKF82958, the D2 agonist and anticraving drug bromocriptine, or ethanol. In other experiments we blocked D1 receptors with the selective D1 antagonist SCH23390 or blocked D2 receptors with the selective D2 antagonist eticlopride. Finally, we examined combinations of some dopaminergic drugs with and without ethanol.
SKF82958 alone significantly increased PKA-mediated phosphorylation of both DARPP-32 and NR1. Bromocriptine alone had no effect on pDARPP-32 or on pNR1. However, when D1 receptors were blocked, bromocriptine reduced the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of both DARPP-32 and NR1. Coincident treatment with bromocriptine and ethanol reversed both of these effects with D1 receptors blocked. The combination of eticlopride (D2 blocker) and SF82958 (D1 agonist) did not significantly alter either pDARPP-32 or pNR1.
These data demonstrate antagonistic effects of acute ethanol exposure on D1 signaling in vivo and the potential of acute in vivo challenge protocols to help fill gaps in the understanding of ethanol's effects on protein phosphorylation.
Subcellular distributions of extracellular signal-kinases (ERK1/2), including their activated form (p-ERK1/2), were investigated in glutamate-induced apoptotic-like death in cultured rat cortical neurons by Western immunoblot and immunocytochemistry. During 15 min glutamate exposure, p-ERK1/2 was increased in both cytosol and nuclear extracts, but prominently so in nuclear extracts. Simultaneously, ERK1/2 were mildly decreased in cytosol (to 0.7-fold vs sham control), largely increased in nuclear extracts (to 6.2-fold vs sham control), but not changed in total cell extracts. Immunocytochemistry studies also showed a large increase in nuclear and a mild decrease in cytosol extracts of ERK1/2 at 15 min of exposure. After glutamate exposure, all the above changes reverted simultaneously. The nuclear increase of ERK1/2 was largely prevented by inhibition of ERK1/2 activation, but prolonged by elongation of ERK1/2 activation. These observations suggest that stimulation of glutamate receptors in cortical neurons may incur an activation-dependent transient nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, which might be involved in excitotoxicity through a simultaneous strong elevation of p-ERK1/2 in nucleus.
Perturbation of normal survival mechanisms may play a role in a large number of disease processes. Glutamate neurotoxicity, particularly when mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors, has been hypothesized to underlie several types of acute brain injury, including stroke. Several neurological insults linked to excessive release of glutamate and neuronal death result in tyrosine kinase activation, including p44/42 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase. To further explore a role for MAP kinase activation in excitotoxicity, we used a novel tissue culture model to induce neurotoxicity. Removal of the endogenous blockade by Mg2+ of the NMDA receptor in cultured hippocampal neurons triggers a self perpetuating cycle of excitotoxicity, which has relatively slow onset, and is critically dependent on NMDA receptors and activation of voltage gated Na+ channels. These injury conditions led to a rapid phosphorylation of p44/42 that was blocked by MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. MEK inhibition was associated with protection against synaptically mediated excitotoxicity. Interestingly, hippocampal neurons preconditioned by a sublethal exposure to Mg(2+)-free conditions were rendered resistant to injury induced by a subsequently longer exposure to this insult; the preconditioning effect was MAP kinase dependent. The MAP kinase signaling pathway can also promote polypeptide growth factor mediated neuronal survival. MAP kinase regulated pathways may act to promote survival or death, depending upon the cellular context in which they are activated.
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+. Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel. After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger. Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation. NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity. Histochemical studies have revealed the presence of a large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei. Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system. The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake. In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction. It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.
The beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) is the most abundant subtype of beta-adrenergic receptor in the mammalian brain and is known to potently regulate synaptic plasticity. To search for potential neuronal beta(1)AR-interacting proteins, we screened a rat brain cDNA library using the beta(1)AR carboxyl terminus (beta(1)AR-CT) as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. These screens identified PSD-95, a multiple PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein, as a specific binding partner of the beta(1)AR-CT. This interaction was confirmed by in vitro fusion protein pull-down and blot overlay experiments, which demonstrated that the beta(1)AR-CT binds specifically to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. Furthermore, the full-length beta(1)AR associates with PSD-95 in cells, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence co-localization studies. The interaction between beta(1)AR and PSD-95 is mediated by the last few amino acids of the beta(1)AR, and mutation of the beta(1)AR carboxyl terminus eliminated the binding and disrupted the co-localization of the beta(1)AR and PSD-95 in cells. Agonist-induced internalization of the beta(1)AR in HEK-293 cells was markedly attenuated by PSD-95 co-expression, whereas co-expression of PSD-95 has no significant effect on either desensitization of the beta(1)AR or beta(1)AR-induced cAMP accumulation. Furthermore, PSD-95 facilitated the formation of a complex between the beta(1)AR and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. These data reveal that PSD-95 is a specific beta(1)AR binding partner that modulates beta(1)AR function and facilitates physical association of the beta(1)AR with synaptic proteins, such as the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which are known to be regulated by beta(1)AR stimulation.
The NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor is physically associated with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 at glutamatergic synapses. The channel activity of NMDA receptors is regulated by different signaling molecules, including protein tyrosine kinases. Because previous results have suggested a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in insulin potentiation of NMDA currents in oocytes, the effects of coexpression of PSD-95 on insulin and PKC potentiation of NMDA currents from these receptors were compared. Another primary objective was to determine if PSD-95 could enable Src to potentiate currents from NR2A/NR1 and NR2B/NR1 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The results show opposite effects of PSD-95 coexpression on Src and insulin modulation of NR2A/NR1 receptor currents. Src potentiation of mouse NR2A/NR1 currents required PSD-95 coexpression. In contrast, PSD-95 coexpression eliminated insulin-mediated potentiation of NR2A/NR1 receptor currents. PSD-95 coexpression also eliminated PKC potentiation of NR2A/NR1 receptor currents. PSD-95 may therefore play a key role in controlling kinase modulation of NR2A/NR1 receptor currents at glutamatergic synapses.
A large proportion of grafted striatal neurons die, and mechanisms by which they succumb may involve excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of pretreatment of the graft tissue with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (+)dizocilpine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) and lipid peroxidation inhibitor lazaroid U-83836E on the survival of transplanted striatal neurons. Neither compound increased the survival of grafts, suggesting that NMDA-related excitotoxicity or oxidative stress may not be primary mediators of cell death in striatal grafts.
Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations, affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders. 
The mammalian striatin family consists of three proteins, striatin, S/G2 nuclear autoantigen, and zinedin. Striatin family members have no intrinsic catalytic activity, but rather function as scaffolding proteins. Remarkably, they organize multiple diverse, large signaling complexes that participate in a variety of cellular processes. Moreover, they appear to be regulatory/targeting subunits for the major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. In addition, striatin family members associate with germinal center kinase III kinases as well as other novel components, earning these assemblies the name striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. Recently, there has been a great increase in functional and mechanistic studies aimed at identifying and understanding the roles of STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes in cellular processes of multiple organisms. These studies have identified novel STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes and have explored their roles in specific signaling pathways. Together, the results of these studies have sparked increased interest in striatin family complexes because they have revealed roles in signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, Golgi assembly, cell polarity, cell migration, neural and vascular development, and cardiac function. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been connected to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, autism, and cerebral cavernous malformation. In this review, we discuss the expression, localization, and protein domain structure of striatin family members. Then we consider the diverse complexes these proteins and their homologs form in various organisms, emphasizing what is known regarding function and regulation. Finally, we explore possible roles of striatin family complexes in disease, especially cerebral cavernous malformation. 
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have confirmed that brief remifentanil exposure can enhance pain sensitivity presenting as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists have been reported to inhibit morphine analgesic tolerance in many studies. Recently, we found that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) modulated NMDA receptor trafficking in a rat model of remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia. In the current study, it was demonstrated that GSK-3β inhibition prevented remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia via regulating the expression and function of spinal NMDA receptors in vivo and in vitro. We firstly investigated the effects of TDZD-8, a selective GSK-3β inhibitor, on thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia using a rat model of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. GSK-3β activity as well as NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A and NR2B) expression and trafficking in spinal cord L4-L5 segments were measured by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the effects of GSK-3β inhibition on NMDA-induced current amplitude and frequency were studied in spinal cord slices by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We found that remifentanil infusion at 1 μg·kg(-1)·min(-1) and 2 μg·kg(-1)·min(-1) caused mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, up-regulated NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B expression in both membrane fraction and total lysate of the spinal cord dorsal horn and increased GSK-3β activity in spinal cord dorsal horn. GSK-3β inhibitor TDZD-8 significantly attenuated remifentanil-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia from 2 h to 48 h after infusion, and this was associated with reversal of up-regulated NR1 and NR2B subunits in both membrane fraction and total lysate. Furthermore, remifentanil incubation increased amplitude and frequency of NMDA receptor-induced current in dorsal horn neurons, which was prevented with the application of TDZD-8. These results suggest that inhibition of GSK-3β can significantly ameliorate remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia via modulating the expression and function of NMDA receptors, which present useful insights into the mechanistic action of GSK-3β inhibitor as potential anti-hyperalgesic agents for treating OIH. 
The accumulation of amyloid-β-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-β peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-β. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. 
In the search for new drug targets, that may help point the way to develop fast-acting treatments for mood disorders, we have explored molecular pathways regulated by ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has consistently shown antidepressant response within a few hours of administration. Using Sprague-Dawley rats we investigated the effects of ketamine on the presynaptic release machinery responsible for neurotransmitter release at 1, 2 and 4 h as well as 7 days after administration of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (15 mg/kg). A large reduction in the accumulation of SNARE complexes was observed in hippocampal synaptic membranes after 1, 2 and 4 h of ketamine administration. In parallel, we found a selective reduction in the expression of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin I and an increase in the levels of synapsin I in hippocampal synaptosomes suggesting a mechanism by which ketamine reduces SNARE complex formation, in part, by regulating the number of synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminals. Moreover, ketamine reduced Thr(286)-phosphorylated αCaMKII and its interaction with syntaxin 1A, which identifies CaMKII as a potential target for second messenger-mediated actions of ketamine. In addition, despite previous reports of ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK-3, we were unable to detect regulation of its activity after ketamine administration. Our findings demonstrate that ketamine rapidly induces changes in the hippocampal presynaptic machinery similar to those that are obtained only with chronic treatments with traditional antidepressants. This suggests that reduction of neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus has possible relevance for the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine.
Humans are routinely exposed to low levels of bisphenol A (BPA), a synthetic xenoestrogen widely used in the production of polycarbonate plastics. The effects of long-term exposure to BPA on memory and modification of synaptic structure in hippocampus of adult mice were investigated in the present study. The adult mice were exposed to BPA (0.4, 4, and 40 mg/kg/day) or arachis oil for 12 weeks. In open field test, BPA at 0.4, 4, or 40 mg/kg/day increased the frequency of rearing and time in the central area of the males, while BPA at 0.4 mg/kg/day reduced the frequency of rearing in the females. Exposure to BPA (0.4 or 40 mg/kg/day) extended the average escape pathlength to the hidden platform in Morris water maze task and shortened the step-down latency 24 h after footshock of the males, but no changes were found in the females for these measures. Meanwhile, BPA induced a reduced numeric synaptic density and a negative effect on the structural parameters of synaptic interface, including an enlarged synaptic cleft and the reduced length of active zone and PSD thickness, in the hippocampus of the male mice. Western blot analyses further indicated that BPA down-regulated expressions of synaptic proteins (synapsin I and PSD-95) and synaptic NMDA receptor subunit NR1 and AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 in the hippocampus of the males. These results suggest that long-term exposure to low levels of BPA in adulthood sex-specifically impaired spatial and passive avoidance memory of mice. These effects may be associated with the higher susceptibility of the hippocampal synaptic plasticity processes, such as remodeling of spinal synapses and the expressions of synaptic proteins (e.g. synapsin I and PSD-95) and NMDA and AMPA receptors, to BPA in the adult male mice.
The coupling of the spinal postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) with the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit and the subsequent NR2B phosphorylation contribute to pain-related plasticity. Increasing evidence reveals that kalirin, a Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor, modulates PSD-95-NR2B-dependent neuroplasticity. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that serum-inducible and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) participates in inflammation-associated pain hypersensitivity by modulating spinal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Because kalirin is one of the proteins in PSD that is highly phosphorylated by various kinases, we tested whether kalirin could be a downstream target of spinal SGK1 that participates in neuropathic pain development via regulation of the PSD-95-NR2B coupling-dependent phosphorylation of NR2B. We observed that spinal nerve ligation (SNL, L5) in male Sprague Dawley rats resulted in behavioral allodynia, which was associated with phosphorylated SGK1 (pSGK1), kalirin, and phosphorylated NR2B (pNR2B) expression and an increase in pSGK1-kalirin-PSD-95-pNR2B coprecipitation in the ipsilateral dorsal horn (L4-L5). SNL-enhanced kalirin immunofluorescence was coincident with pSGK1, PSD-95, and pNR2B immunoreactivity. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) that targeted spinal kalirin mRNA expression (10 μg, 10 μl; i.t.) reduced SNL-induced allodynia, kalirin and pNR2B expression, as well as kalirin-PSD-95 and PSD-95-pNR2B coupling and costaining without affecting SGK1 phosphorylation. Daily administration of GSK-650394 (an SGK1 antagonist; 100 nm, 10 μl, i.t.) not only exhibited effects similar to the kalirin mRNA-targeting siRNA but also attenuated pSGK1-kalirin costaining and SGK1-kalirin coupling. We suggest that nerve injury could induce spinal SGK1 phosphorylation that subsequently interacts with and upregulates kalirin to participate in neuropathic pain development via PSD-95-NR2B coupling-dependent NR2B phosphorylation.
Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus depends on the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which can be regulated by Ca²⁺-dependent release of D-serine from astrocytes. The detailed mechanism underlying astrocytic d-serine release is still unknown. In hippocampal slices prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats, we found that clamping astrocytic [Ca²⁺] at 100-150 nM or puffing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) into the extracellular space (weak mechanical stimulation) enhanced the synaptic activation of NMDARs. The enhancement was blocked by the NMDAR glycine site antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, glycine saturation, and infusion of astrocytes with D-amino acid oxidase and the serine racemase inhibitor L-erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate, suggesting the involvement of astrocytic D-serine release. Intracellular 100-150 nM [Ca²⁺] or puffing ACSF stimulated astrocytes to generate D-serine-containing large vesicles (1-3 μm), exocytotic fusion of which released D-serine. The formation of astrocytic large vesicles involved the intracellular fusion of small vesicles and/or other organelles. Spontaneous fusion of large vesicles occurred occasionally in astrocytes at rest, contributing to baseline D-serine levels, which increased the rising slope of NMDAR post-burst potentiation (PBP) without altering the PBP peak amplitude. Thus, under physiological conditions, astrocytic D-serine release by large vesicles facilitated weak theta-burst (TBS consisting of five bursts), but not strong TBS (TBS consisting of 10 bursts) stimulation-induced LTP.
Several lines of evidence suggest that common polygenic variation influences brain function in humans. Combining high-density genetic markers with brain imaging techniques is constricted by the practicalities of collecting sufficiently large brain imaging samples. Pathway analysis promises to leverage knowledge on function of genes to detect recurring signals of moderate effect. We adapt this approach, exploiting the deep information collected on brain function by fMRI methods, to identify molecular pathways containing genetic variants which influence brain activation during a commonly applied experiment based on a face matching task (n=246) which was developed to study neural processing of faces displaying negative emotions. Genetic markers moderately associated (p&lt;10(-4)) with whole brain activation phenotypes constructed by applying principal components to contrast maps, were tested for pathway enrichment using permutation based methods. The most significant pathways are related to post NMDA receptor activation events, driven by genetic variants in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2G, CAMK2D) and a calcium-regulated nucleotide exchange factor (RASGRF2) in which all are activated by intracellular calcium/calmodulin. The most significant effect of the combined polygenic model were localized to the left inferior frontal gyrus (p=1.03 × 10(-9)), a region primarily involved in semantic processing but also involved in processing negative emotions. These findings suggest that pathway analysis of GWAS results derived from principal component analysis of fMRI data is a promising method, to our knowledge, not previously described.
Understanding how brief synaptic events can lead to sustained changes in synaptic structure and strength is a necessary step in solving the rules governing learning and memory. Activation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1/2) plays a key role in the control of functional and structural synaptic plasticity. One of the triggering events that activates ERK1/2 cascade is an NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent rise in free intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. However the mechanism by which a short-lasting rise in Ca(2+) concentration is transduced into long-lasting ERK1/2-dependent plasticity remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that although synaptic activation in mouse cultured cortical neurons induces intracellular Ca(2+) elevation via both GluN2A and GluN2B-containing NMDARs, only GluN2B-containing NMDAR activation leads to a long-lasting ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We show that αCaMKII, but not βCaMKII, is critically involved in this GluN2B-dependent activation of ERK1/2 signaling, through a direct interaction between GluN2B and αCaMKII. We then show that interfering with GluN2B/αCaMKII interaction prevents synaptic activity from inducing ERK-dependent increases in synaptic AMPA receptors and spine volume. Thus, in a developing circuit model, the brief activity of synaptic GluN2B-containing receptors and the interaction between GluN2B and αCaMKII have a role in long-term plasticity via the control of ERK1/2 signaling. Our findings suggest that the roles that these major molecular elements have in learning and memory may operate through a common pathway.
Synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory, involves the dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) into and out of synapses. One of the remaining key unanswered aspects of AMPAR trafficking is the mechanism by which synaptic strength is preserved despite protein turnover. In particular, the identity of AMPAR scaffolding molecule(s) involved in the maintenance of GluA2-containing AMPARs is completely unknown. Here we report that the synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM; also called membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-2 and atrophin interacting protein-1) plays the critical role of maintaining synaptic strength. Increasing S-SCAM levels in rat hippocampal neurons led to specific increases in the surface AMPAR levels, enhanced AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, and enlargement of dendritic spines, without significantly effecting GluN levels or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) EPSC. Conversely, decreasing S-SCAM levels by RNA interference-mediated knockdown caused the loss of synaptic AMPARs, which was followed by a severe reduction in the dendritic spine density. Importantly, S-SCAM regulated synaptic AMPAR levels in a manner, dependent on GluA2 not GluA1, sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein interaction, and independent of activity. Further, S-SCAM increased surface AMPAR levels in the absence of PSD-95, while PSD-95 was dependent on S-SCAM to increase surface AMPAR levels. Finally, S-SCAM overexpression hampered NMDA-induced internalization of AMPARs and prevented the induction of long term-depression, while S-SCAM knockdown did not. Together, these results suggest that S-SCAM is an essential AMPAR scaffolding molecule for the GluA2-containing pool of AMPARs, which are involved in the constitutive pathway of maintaining synaptic strength.
The NMDA receptor plays a large role in opioid-induced plastic changes in the nervous system. The expression levels of its NR1 subunit are altered dramatically by morphine but no changes in its alternative splicing have been reported. Changes in the splicing of the N1, C1, C2, and C2' cassettes can alter the pharmacology and regulation of this receptor. Western Blots run on brain tissue from rats made tolerant to morphine revealed altered splicing of the N1 cassettes in the accumbens and amygdala (AMY), and the C1 cassette in the AMY and the dorsal hippocampus (HIPP). After 3days of withdrawal C2'-containing NR1 subunits were down-regulated in each of these areas. These were not due to acute doses of morphine and may represent long-term alterations in drug-induced neuroplasticity. We also examined the effects of morphine tolerance on an operant orofacial nociception assay which forces an animal to endure an aversive heat stimulus in order to receive a sweet milk reward. Morphine decreased pain sensitivity as expected but also increased motivational reward seeking in this task. NMDAR antagonism potentiated this reward seeking behavior suggesting that instead of attenuating tolerance, MK-801 may actually alter the rewarding and/or motivational properties of morphine. When combined, MK-801 and morphine had an additive effect which led to altered splicing in the accumbens, AMY, and the HIPP. In conclusion, NR1 splicing may play a major role in the cognitive behavioral aspects especially in motivational reward-seeking behaviors.
Chronic arsenic exposure has an adverse effect on neurobehavioral function. Our previous study demonstrated an elevated arsenic level, ultra-structure changes and reduced NR2A gene expression in hippocampus, and impaired spatial learning in arsenite-exposed rats. The NMDA receptor and the postsynaptic signaling proteins CaMKII, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) and nuclear activated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) play important roles in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. We hypothesized that the above molecular expression changes may contribute to arsenic neurotoxicity. In present study, the expression of NMDA receptor and postsynaptic signaling proteins in hippocampus were evaluated in rats exposed to 0, 2.72, 13.6 and 68 mg/L sodium arsenite for 3 months. Decreased protein expression of NR2A, PSD-95 and p-CaMKII α in the hippocampus of arsenite-exposed rats was observed, while the expression of SynGAP, a negative regulator of Ras-MAPK activity, was increased when compared with the controls. Additionally, decreased p-ERK1/2 activity was found in the hippocampus of arsenite-exposed rats. These data suggest that altered expression of NMDA receptor complex and postsynaptic signaling proteins may explain arsenic-induced neurotoxicity.
NMDA receptor activation leads to clathrin-dependent endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Although this process controls long-term depression (LTD) induction in the hippocampus, how it is regulated by neuronal activities is not completely clear. Here, we show that Ca²⁺ influx through the NMDA receptor activates calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinaseγ661 (PIP5Kγ661), the major phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P₂)-producing enzyme in the brain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that the dephosphorylated PIP5Kγ661 became associated with the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2 at postsynapses in situ. NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis and low-frequency stimulation-induced LTD were completely blocked by inhibiting the association between dephosphorylated PIP5Kγ661 and AP-2 and by overexpression of a kinase-dead PIP5Kγ661 mutant in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, knockdown of PIP5Kγ661 inhibited the NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis. Therefore, NMDA receptor activation controls AMPA receptor endocytosis during hippocampal LTD by regulating PIP5Kγ661 activity at postsynapses.
Dieldrin is an endocrine disruptor that accumulates in mammalian adipose tissue and brain. It induces convulsions due to its antagonism of the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA(A)R). We have previously reported that long-term exposure to dieldrin causes the internalization of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) as a result of persistent GABA(A)R inhibition. Because the neurosteroids 17β-estradiol (E2) and allopregnanolone are known to modulate the function and trafficking of GABA(A)R and NMDAR, we examined the effects of E2 and allopregnanolone on dieldrin-induced GABA(A)R inhibition, NMDAR internalization, and neuronal death in cortical neurons. We found that 1 nM E2 increased the membrane expression of NR1/NR2B receptors and postsynaptic density 95 but did not induce their physical association. In contrast, 10 nM E2 had no effect on these proteins but reduced NR2A membrane expression. We also found that exposure to 60 nM dieldrin for 6 d in vitro caused the internalization of NR1 and NR2B but not NR2A. Treatment with either 1 nM E2 or 10 μM allopregnanolone prevented the dieldrin-induced reduction in membrane levels of the NR1/NR2B receptors. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to 200 nM dieldrin down-regulated the expression of NR2A; this was inhibited only by allopregnanolone. Although both hormones restored NMDAR function, as measured by the NMDA-induced rise in intracellular calcium, allopregnanolone (but not E2) reversed the inhibition of GABA(A)R and neuronal death caused by prolonged exposure to dieldrin. Our results indicate that allopregnanolone protects cortical neurons against the neurotoxicity caused by long-term exposure to dieldrin by maintaining GABA(A)R and NMDAR functionality.
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction, POCD, afflicts a large number of elderly surgical patients following surgery with general anesthesia. Mechanisms of POCD remain unclear. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, critical in learning and memory, that display protein expression changes with age are modulated by inhalation anesthetics. The aim of this study was to identify protein expression changes in NMDA receptor subunits and downstream signaling pathways in aged rats that demonstrated anesthesia-induced spatial learning impairments. Three-month-old and 18-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to receive 1.8% isoflurane/70% nitrous oxide (N(2)O) anesthesia for 4h or no anesthesia. Spatial learning was assessed at 2weeks and 3months post-anesthesia in Morris water maze. Hippocampal and cortical protein lysates of 18-month-old rats were immunoblotted for activated caspase 3, NMDA receptor subunits, and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In a separate experiment, Ro 25-6981 (0.5mg/kg dose) was administered by I.P. injection before anesthesia to 18-month-old rats. Immunoblotting of NR2B was performed on hippocampal protein lysates. At 3months post-anesthesia, rats treated with anesthesia at 18-months-old demonstrated spatial learning impairment corresponding to acute and long-term increases in NR2B protein expression and a reduction in phospho-ERK1/2 in the hippocampus and cortex. Ro 25-6981 pretreatment attenuated the increase in acute NR2B protein expression. Our findings suggest a role for disruption of NMDA receptor mediated signaling pathways in the hippocampus and cortex of rats treated with isoflurane/ N(2)O anesthesia at 18-months-old, leading to spatial learning deficits in these animals. A potential therapeutic intervention for anesthesia associated cognitive deficits is discussed.
A small number of rare, recurrent genomic copy number variants (CNVs) are known to substantially increase susceptibility to schizophrenia. As a consequence of the low fecundity in people with schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes to which these CNVs contribute, CNVs with large effects on risk are likely to be rapidly removed from the population by natural selection. Accordingly, such CNVs must frequently occur as recurrent de novo mutations. In a sample of 662 schizophrenia proband-parent trios, we found that rare de novo CNV mutations were significantly more frequent in cases (5.1% all cases, 5.5% family history negative) compared with 2.2% among 2623 controls, confirming the involvement of de novo CNVs in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Eight de novo CNVs occurred at four known schizophrenia loci (3q29, 15q11.2, 15q13.3 and 16p11.2). De novo CNVs of known pathogenic significance in other genomic disorders were also observed, including deletion at the TAR (thrombocytopenia absent radius) region on 1q21.1 and duplication at the WBS (Williams-Beuren syndrome) region at 7q11.23. Multiple de novos spanned genes encoding members of the DLG (discs large) family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) that are components of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Two de novos also affected EHMT1, a histone methyl transferase known to directly regulate DLG family members. Using a systems biology approach and merging novel CNV and proteomics data sets, systematic analysis of synaptic protein complexes showed that, compared with control CNVs, case de novos were significantly enriched for the PSD proteome (P=1.72 × 10⁻⁶. This was largely explained by enrichment for members of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) (P=4.24 × 10⁻⁶) and neuronal activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) (P=3.78 × 10⁻⁸) postsynaptic signalling complexes. In an analysis of 18 492 subjects (7907 cases and 10 585 controls), case CNVs were enriched for members of the NMDAR complex (P=0.0015) but not ARC (P=0.14). Our data indicate that defects in NMDAR postsynaptic signalling and, possibly, ARC complexes, which are known to be important in synaptic plasticity and cognition, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
Genes that mediate mate preferences potentially play a key role in promoting and maintaining biological diversity. In this study, we compare mate preference behavior in two related poeciliid fishes with contrasting behavioral phenotypes and relate these behavioral differences to gene profiles in the brain. Results reveal that one poeciliid fish, the Northern swordtail, exhibits robust mate preference as compared to the Western mosquitofish, which utilizes a coercive mating system. Female swordtails display no significant difference in association time between male- and female-exposure trials, whereas female mosquitofish spend significantly less time associating with males relative to females. Furthermore, the preference strength for large males is significantly lower in female mosquitofish relative to swordtails. We then examine expression of three candidate genes previously shown to be associated with mate preference behavior in female swordtails and linked to neural plasticity in other vertebrates: neuroserpin (NS), neuroligin-3 (NLG-3) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R). Whole brain gene expression patterns reveal that two genes (NS and NLG-3) are positively associated with mate preference behavior in female swordtails, a pattern opposing that of the mosquitofish. In mosquitofish females, these genes are downregulated when females express biases toward males yet are elevated in association with total motor activity patterns under asocial conditions, suggesting that the presence of males in mosquitofish species may inhibit expression of these genes. Both gene expression and female behavioral responses to males exhibit opposing patterns between these species, suggesting that this genetic pathway may potentially act as a substrate for the evolution of mate preference behavior.
CALHM1 (calcium homoeostasis modulator 1), a membrane protein with similarity to NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels that localizes in the plasma membrane and the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) of neurons, has been shown to generate a plasma-membrane Ca(2+) conductance and has been proposed to influence Alzheimer's disease risk. In the present study we have investigated the effects of CALHM1 on intracellular Ca(2+) handling in HEK-293T [HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells expressing the large T-antigen of SV40 (simian virus 40)] cells by using targeted aequorins for selective monitorization of Ca(2+) transport by organelles. We find that CALHM1 increases Ca(2+) leak from the ER and, more importantly, reduces ER Ca(2+) uptake by decreasing both the transport capacity and the Ca(2+) affinity of SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase). As a result, the Ca(2+) content of the ER is drastically decreased. This reduction in the Ca(2+) content of the ER triggered the UPR (unfolded protein response) with induction of several ER stress markers, such as CHOP [C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein)-homologous protein], ERdj4, GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa) and XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1). Thus CALHM1 might provide a relevant link between Ca(2+) homoeostasis disruption, ER stress and cell damage in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are major components of the postsynaptic density and play important roles in synaptic organization and plasticity. Most excitatory synapses are located on dendritic spines, which are dynamic structures that undergo morphological changes during synapse formation and plasticity. Synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) is a MAGUK that is highly expressed early in development and mediates receptor trafficking during synaptogenesis. Mutations in human SAP102 cause mental retardation, which is often accompanied with abnormalities in dendritic spines. However, little is known about the role of SAP102 in regulating synapse formation or spine morphology. We now find that SAP102 contains a novel NMDA receptor binding site in the N-terminal domain, which is specific for the NR2B subunit. The interaction between SAP102 and NR2B is PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1) domain independent and is regulated by alternative splicing of SAP102. We show that SAP102 that possesses an N-terminal insert is developmentally regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, expression of SAP102 increases synapse formation. Furthermore, the alternative splicing of SAP102 regulates dendritic spine morphology. SAP102 containing the N-terminal insert promotes lengthening of dendritic spines and preferentially promotes the formation of synapses at long spines, whereas a short hairpin RNA knockdown of the same SAP102 splice variant causes spine shrinkage. Finally, blocking NMDA receptor activity prevents the spine lengthening induced by the N-terminal splice variant of SAP102. Thus, our data provide the first evidence that SAP102 links NMDA receptor activation to alterations in spine morphology.
Cellular function, in particular neuronal activity, is the result of an orchestrated interplay between membrane receptors at the cell surface and intracellular signaling proteins. Membrane receptors transduce external signals into cellular responses by activating cytosolic metabolic pathways. Regulation of the spatial and temporal distribution of membrane receptors begins to be recognized as an important mechanism for controlling the magnitude and time course of cellular signaling [1]. For instance, long-term changes in neuronal plasticity are the result of transcriptional and translational regulation of protein biogenesis and trafficking. Similarly, short-term changes in synaptic function can be achieved by altering the levels of key surface proteins involved in synaptic transmission, such as neurotransmitter receptors and transporters [1]. Thus, modulation of receptor function by trafficking and redistribution plays a central role in synaptic plasticity [1–3]. These processes increase the complexity of the signaling mechanisms in peripheral and central synapses. Protein trafficking studies, carried out in yeast and mammalian cells, have revealed the underlying mechanism by which proteins travel between intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane. Membrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and ensuing posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation take place in both the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Appropriately folded and assembled membrane proteins are subsequently sorted out into vesicles for trafficking and delivery to the cell surface by a constitutive or regulated pathway of vesicle exocytosis [4]. The constitutive exocytotic route is primarily used by cells for turnover of both membrane proteins and lipids, thus ensuring the removal of aged or damaged membrane components. In contrast, the regulated secretory pathway is used by specialized cells, such as endocrine cells, neurons, acinar cells of the pancreas, mast cells, insulin-sensitive cells, and many other cell types, as a mechanism of cellular communication. Regulated exocytosis is produced only in response to a stimulus that provokes the mobilization, docking, and fusion of an intracellular pool of vesicles stored near the membrane region where they will fuse and release their components [1–5]. Mechanistically, both types of exocytosis use a cascade of protein–protein interactions to ensure the efficient delivery of their vesicle cargo to the membrane [2,5]. At a molecular level, vesicle traffic uses the SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors), a large family of proteins that are present on all organelles and mediate intracellular vesicle trafficking and secretion (Figure 23.1) [2,5]. The interaction of complementary SNARE proteins found on opposing membranes exemplifies an attractive lock-and-key mechanism, which presumably underlies the remarkable specificity of vesicle docking to target membranes and their consequent fusion [5]. For instance, the interaction of the vesicle membrane SNARE (v-SNARE) synaptobrevin 2, and the corresponding SNAREs in the target membrane (t-SNAREs), syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, results in the formation of a remarkably stable ternary complex that ensures the docking and fusion of vesicles at the active zone upon receiving the stimulus, normally an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca [2]]i).+5 Similarly, molecular interactions of synaptobrevin 2 analogues with syntaxin 1 and SNAP25-like target membrane proteins are thought to be essential for vesicle targeting and fusion in all eukaryotes [2]. It is quite well established that a significant increase in [Ca2+]i is required for triggering the SNARE-mediated fusion of secretory vesicles, although SNARE-dependent exocytosis of vesicles, in particular recycling vesicles, may occur at resting [Ca2+]i by the activation of other signaling pathways [2]. Nonetheless, the rate of vesicle recycling is regulated by changes in the [Ca2+]i Vesicle exocytosis is a highly regulated process counterbalanced by endocytosis of membrane components that ensures constant plasma membrane content. Internalization of receptors and transporters is mediated by a general clathrin-dependent pathway that moves endocytosed proteins to the endosome for appropriate sorting into vesicles, either for release or for transport depending on their final destination [3,4]. The endosome also provides a mechanism to maintain the proper composition of release vesicle proteins by adding newly synthesized vesicle proteins, removing aged polypeptides for degradation, and separating nonsecretory vesicle proteins [3]. Recent evidence suggests that synaptic vesicles are most likely formed at the nerve terminal by endocytosis. This novel notion considers that newly synthesized membrane proteins traffic to the nerve terminal in transport packets and become incorporated into synaptic vesicles at the synapse, thus indicating that synaptic vesicle formation relies primarily on an endocytotic pathway [3,4]. This hypothesis is particularly attractive for the regulation of the surface expression of ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and transporters presynaptically due to the lack of biosynthetic pools of membrane proteins available in the synapse [4]. Traditionally, the constitutive exocytotic pathway has been associated to the traffic of membrane proteins to the cell surface, while the regulated secretory pathway has been implicated in the activity-dependent release of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and hormones. However, in the past decade emerged the notion that the surface expression of membrane proteins, especially ion channels, receptors, and transporters, may be mediated by a regulated release pathway as well [2–4]. Indeed, cumulative evidence indicates that the function of these plasma membrane proteins can be increased or decreased by accommodating the level of the surface-expressed protein. Indeed, dynamic regulation of the rate of either insertion or retrieval or both of integral membrane proteins in response to stimuli embodies the strategic regulation of their surface expression [3,4]. Examples of receptors and transporters that are modulated by vesicle trafficking are the glucose transporter (GluT4) [6], Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) [7], epithelial sodium channel (ENac) [8], cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) [8], as well as ionotropic ligand-gated receptors such as -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), gamma-aminobutyrate (GABAA), and the purinergic receptor P2X4 [9]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that this signaling pathway is also commonly used by members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels for modulation of their physiological function [10].
Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of AM251, a cannabinoid 1 (CB(1)) receptor antagonist, into the spinal lumbar space of mice elicited a behavioral response consisting of biting and licking with a few scratchings. In this study, we investigated to determine whether i.t. AM251 could influence the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) activation. The CB(1) receptor agonist ACEA, neurokinin 1 (NK(1)) receptor antagonists and NMDA receptor antagonists, inhibited i.t. AM251-induced behavioral response in a dose-dependent manner. The CB(2) receptor agonist, JWH-133 gave no effect on response elicited by i.t. AM251. Both non-selective NOS inhibitors, L-NAME and 7-NI, and N(ω)-propyl-L-arginine, a selective inhibitor of nNOS resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of i.t. AM251-induced behavioral response. The selective iNOS inhibitor, 1400W, in relatively large doses, inhibited in a non dose-dependent manner. The i.t. injection of AM251 produced a definite activation of ERK1/2 in the lumbar dorsal spinal cord. Behavioral experiments showed that U0126, a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, dose-dependently attenuated the behavioral response to i.t. AM251. Spinal activation of ERK1/2 following i.t. AM251 was reduced clearly by N(ω)-propyl-L-arginine and U0126, while 1400W gave a significant effect on only ERK1 activation. These findings suggest that the nNOS-ERK pathway in spinal cord neurones plays an important role in AM251-induced nocifensive behavior and its inhibition may provide significant anti-nociception.
Accumulating evidence supports that activation of inflammatory pathways is a crucial factor contributing to the pathogenesis of seizures. In particular, the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) system exerts proconvulsant effects in a large variety of seizure models. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a critical adaptor protein in the signaling cascade elicited by IL-1β. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of MyD88 in rat models of seizures and in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and to study the role of MyD88 in epileptic seizures. Our results revealed that MyD88 was up-regulated in the hippocampus of rats in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute seizures. Importantly, MyD88 overexpression was also significantly present in the brain from chronic epileptic rats and the temporal neocortex specimens from drug-resistant TLE patients. In the acute seizure model, both the behavioral and electrographic seizure activities were record and analyzed in rats for 90min, starting immediately after pilocarpine injection. ST2825, a synthetic MyD88 inhibitor, was administered intracerebroventricularly (2.5-5.0-10μg in 2μl) 20min before pilocarpine injection. We found that ST2825 at doses of 5μg and 10μg significantly inhibited the pilocarpine-induced behavioral and electrographic seizures. Moreover, 10μg ST2825 prevented the proconvulsant actions of IL-1β. As previous evidence suggested that IL-1β proconvulsant effects was mediated by enhancing the phosphorylation level of the NR2B subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, we then probed whether this molecular was involved in the effect of the pharmacological inhibition. Our results revealed that 10μg ST2825 markedly reversed the increased Tyr1472-phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor observed in the proconvulsant conditions of IL-1β and in seizures induced by pilocarpine alone. These findings indicate that altered expression of MyD88 might contribute to the pathogenesis of seizures and targeting of this adaptor protein might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress seizure activities.
Sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine have been found to provide rapid antidepressant actions, indicating that the cellular signaling systems targeted by ketamine are potential sites for therapeutic intervention. Ketamine acts as an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and animal studies indicate that subsequent augmentation of signaling by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors is critical for the antidepressant outcome.
In this study, we tested if the inhibitory effect of ketamine on glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) affected hippocampal cell-surface AMPA receptors using immunoblotting of membrane and synaptosomal extracts from wild-type and GSK3 knockin mice.
Treatment with an antidepressant dose of ketamine increased the hippocampal membrane level of the AMPA glutamate receptor (GluA)1 subunit, but did not alter the localization of GluA2, GluA3, or GluA4. This effect of ketamine was abrogated in GSK3 knockin mice expressing mutant GSK3 that cannot be inhibited by ketamine, demonstrating that ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK3 is necessary for up-regulation of cell surface AMPA GluA1 subunits. AMPA receptor trafficking is regulated by post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95), a substrate for GSK3. Ketamine treatment decreased the hippocampal membrane level of phosphorylated PSD-95 on Thr-19, the target of GSK3 that promotes AMPA receptor internalization.
These results demonstrate that ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK3 causes reduced phosphorylation of PSD-95, diminishing the internalization of AMPA GluA1 subunits to allow for augmented signaling through AMPA receptors following ketamine treatment.
Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 (ERK5), also known as big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), is an important member of ERK family, which is a subfamily of the large MAPK family. ERK5 is expressed in many tissues, including the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the spinal cord. In this review, we focus on elaborating ERK5-associated pathway in pathological pain, in which the ERK5/CREB (cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element-binding protein) pathway plays a crucial role in the transduction of pain signal and contributes to pain hypersensitivity. ERK5 activation in the spinal dorsal horn occurs mainly in microglia. The activation of ERK5 can be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. We also elaborate the relationship between ERK5 activation and nerve growth factor-tyrosine kinase A (NGF-TrkA), and the connection between ERK5 activation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in pathological pain in detail.
Corticostriatal cocultures are utilized to recapitulate the cortex-striatum connection in vitro as a convenient model to investigate the development, function, and regulation of synapses formed between cortical and striatal neurons. However, optimization of this dissociated neuronal system to more closely reproduce in vivo circuits has not yet been explored. We studied the effect of varying the plating ratio of cortical to striatal neurons on striatal spiny projection neuron (SPN) characteristics in primary neuronal cocultures. Despite the large difference in cortical-striatal neuron ratio (1:1 vs. 1:3) at day of plating, by 18 days in vitro the difference became modest (∼25% lower cortical-striatal neuron ratio in 1:3 cocultures) and the neuronal density was lower in the 1:3 cocultures, indicating enhanced loss of striatal SPNs. Comparing SPNs in cocultures plated at a 1:1 vs. 1:3 ratio, we found that resting membrane potential, input resistance, current injection-induced action potential firing rates, and input-output curves were similar in the two conditions. However, SPNs in the cocultures plated at the lower cortical ratio exhibited reduced membrane capacitance along with significantly shorter total dendritic length, decreased dendritic complexity, and fewer excitatory synapses, consistent with their trend toward reduced miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. Strikingly, the proportion of NMDA receptors found extrasynaptically in recordings from SPNs was significantly higher in the less cortical coculture. Consistently, SPNs in cocultures with reduced cortical input showed decreased basal pro-survival signaling through cAMP response element binding protein and enhanced sensitivity to NMDA-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our study indicates that abundance of cortical input regulates SPN dendritic arborization and survival/death signaling.
The transmembrane protein assembly γ-secretase is a key protease in regulated intramembrane processing (RIP) of around 100 type-1 transmembrane proteins. Importantly, it has a pathological role in Alzheimer disease (AD) as it generates the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Studies on γ-secretase location are therefore crucial both from a biological and a therapeutic perspective. Despite several years of efforts in many laboratories, it is not clear where in the neuron γ-secretase exerts it's activities. Technical challenges include the fact that the active enzyme contains four protein components and that most subcellular compartments cannot be spatially resolved by traditional light microscopy. Here, we have used a powerful combination of the two nanoscopy techniques STORM and STED microscopy to visualize the location of γ-secretase in neurons using an active-site specific probe, with a focus on the synapse. We show that γ-secretase is present in both the pre-and postsynaptic compartments. We further show that the enzyme is enriched very close to the synaptic cleft in the postsynaptic membrane, as well as to NMDA receptors, demonstrating that γ-secretase is present in the postsynaptic plasma membrane. Importantly, the expression of γ-secretase increased in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments with the size of the synapse, suggesting a correlation between γ-secretase activity and synapse maturation. Thus, our data shows the synaptic location with high precision in three dimensions and settles the long-lasting debate on the synaptic location of γ-secretase. 
N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are major targets of both acute and chronic alcohol, as well as regulators of plasticity in a number of brain regions. Aberrant plasticity may contribute to the treatment resistance and high relapse rates observed in alcoholics. Recent work suggests that chronic alcohol treatment preferentially modulates both the expression and subcellular localization of NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit. Signaling through synaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDARs has already been implicated in the pathophysiology of various other neurological disorders. NMDARs interact with a large number of proteins at the glutamate synapse, and a better understanding of how alcohol modulates this proteome is needed. We employed a discovery-based proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol (CIE)-exposed C57Bl/6J mice to gain insight into alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B signaling complexes. Protein enrichment analyses revealed changes in the association of post-synaptic proteins, including scaffolding, glutamate receptor and PDZ-domain binding proteins with GluN2B. In particular, GluN2B interaction with metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)1/5 receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD)-associated proteins such as Arc and Homer 1 was increased, while GluA2 was decreased. Accordingly, we found a lack of mGlu1/5 -induced LTD while α1 -adrenergic receptor-induced LTD remained intact in hippocampal CA1 following CIE. These data suggest that CIE specifically disrupts mGlu1/5 -LTD, representing a possible connection between NMDAR and mGlu receptor signaling. These studies not only demonstrate a new way in which alcohol can modulate plasticity in the hippocampus but also emphasize the utility of this discovery-based proteomic approach to generate new hypotheses regarding alcohol-related mechanisms.
Excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation and the resulting activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) cause neuronal injury. Homer1b/c facilitates NMDAR-PSD95-nNOS complex interactions, and Homer1a is a negative competitor of Homer1b/c. We report that Homer1a was both upregulated by and protected against NMDA-induced neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo. The neuroprotective activity of Homer1a was associated with NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx, oxidative stress and the resultant downstream signaling activation. Additionally, we found that Homer1a functionally regulated NMDAR channel properties in neurons, but did not regulate recombinant NR1/NR2B receptors in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, we found that Homer1a detached the physical links among NR2B, PSD95 and nNOS and reduced the membrane distribution of NMDAR. NMDA-induced neuronal injury was more severe in Homer1a homozygous knockout mice (KO, Homer1a-/-) when compared with NMDA-induced neuronal injury in wild-type mice (WT, Homer1a+/+). Additionally, Homer1a overexpression in the cortex of Homer1a-/- mice alleviated NMDA-induced neuronal injury. These findings suggest that Homer1a may be a key neuroprotective endogenous molecule that protects against NMDA-induced neuronal injury by disassembling NR2B-PSD95-nNOS complexes and reducing the membrane distribution of NMDARs.
A change in efficacy of hippocampal synapses is critical for memory formation. So far, the molecular analysis of synapses during learning has focused on small groups of proteins, whereas the dynamic global changes at these synapses have remained unknown. Here, we analyzed the temporal changes of the mouse hippocampal synaptic membrane proteome 1 and 4 h after contextual fear learning, comparing two groups; (1) a fear memory forming "delayed-shock" group and (2) a fear memory-deficient "immediate-shock" group. No changes in protein expression were observed 1 h after conditioning between the two experimental groups. However, 423 proteins were significantly regulated 4 h later of which 164 proteins showed a temporal regulation after a delayed shock and 273 proteins after the stress of an immediate shock. From the proteins that were differentially regulated between the delayed- and the immediate-shock groups at 4 h, 48 proteins, most prominently representing endocytosis, (amphiphysin, dynamin, and synaptojanin1), glutamate signaling (glutamate [NMDA] receptor subunit epsilon-1, disks large homolog 3), and neurotransmitter metabolism (excitatory amino acid transporter 1, excitatory amino acid transporter 2, sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 3) were regulated in both protocols, but in opposite directions, pointing toward an interaction of learning and stress. Taken together, this data set yields novel insight into diverse and dynamic changes that take place at hippocampal synapses over the time course of contextual fear-memory learning.
The rapid regulation of cell signaling in response to calcium in neurons is essential for real-time processing of large amounts of information in the brain. A vital regulatory component, and one of the most energy-intensive biochemical processes in cells, is the elongation phase of mRNA translation, which is controlled by the Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). However, little is known about the dynamics of eEF2K regulation in neurons despite its established role in learning and synaptic plasticity. To explore eEF2K dynamics in depth, we stimulated synaptic activity in mouse primary cortical neurons. We find that synaptic activity results in a rapid, but transient, increase in eEF2K activity that is regulated by a combination of AMPA and NMDA-type glutamate receptors and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways. We then used computational modeling to test the hypothesis that considering Ca(2+)-coordinated MEK/ERK, mTORC1, and eEF2k activation is sufficient to describe the observed eEF2K dynamics. Although such a model could partially fit the empirical findings, it also suggested that a crucial positive regulator of eEF2K was also necessary. Through additional modeling and empirical evidence, we demonstrate that AMP kinase (AMPK) is also an important regulator of synaptic activity-driven eEF2K dynamics in neurons. Our combined modeling and experimental findings provide the first evidence that it is necessary to consider the combined interactions of Ca(2+) with MEK/ERK, mTORC1, and AMPK to adequately explain eEF2K regulation in neurons. 
The appropriate trafficking of glutamate receptors to synapses is crucial for basic synaptic function and synaptic plasticity. It is now accepted that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) internalize and are recycled at the plasma membrane but also exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic pools; these NMDAR properties are also key to governing synaptic plasticity. Scribble1 is a large PDZ protein required for synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that the level of Scribble1 is regulated in an activity-dependent manner and that Scribble1 controls the number of NMDARs at the plasma membrane. Notably, Scribble1 prevents GluN2A subunits from undergoing lysosomal trafficking and degradation by increasing their recycling to the plasma membrane following NMDAR activation. Finally, we show that a specific YxxR motif on Scribble1 controls these mechanisms through a direct interaction with AP2. Altogether, our findings define a molecular mechanism to control the levels of synaptic NMDARs via Scribble1 complex signaling. 
The functional stability of neurons in the face of large variations in both activity and efficacy of synaptic connections suggests that neurons possess intrinsic negative feedback mechanisms to balance and tune excitability. While NMDA receptors have been established to play an important role in glutamate receptor-dependent plasticity through protein dephosphorylation, the effects of synaptic activation on intrinsic excitability are less well characterized. We show that increases in synaptic activity result in dephosphorylation of the potassium channel subunit Kv2.1. This dephosphorylation is induced through NMDA receptors and is executed through protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), an enzyme previously established to play a key role in regulating ligand gated ion channels in synaptic plasticity. Dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 by PP1 in response to synaptic activity results in substantial shifts in the inactivation curve of IK, resulting in a reduction in intrinsic excitability, facilitating negative feedback to neuronal excitability. 
Recent large-scale genomic studies have revealed two broad classes of risk alleles for schizophrenia: a polygenic component of risk mediated through multiple common risk variants and rarer more highly penetrant submicroscopic chromosomal deletions and duplications, known as copy number variants. The focus of this review is on the emerging findings from the latter and subsequent exome sequencing data of smaller, deleterious single nucleotide variants and indels. In these studies, schizophrenia patients were found to have enriched de novo mutations in genes belonging to the postsynaptic density at glutamatergic synapses, particularly components of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor signaling complex, including the PSD-95 complex, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein interactors, the fragile X mental retardation protein complex, voltage-gated calcium channels, and genes implicated in actin cytoskeletal dynamics. The convergence of these implicated genes onto a coherent biological pathway at the synapse, with a specific role in plasticity, provides a significant advance in understanding pathogenesis and points to new targets for biological investigation. We consider the implications of these studies in the context of existing genetic data and the potential need to reassess diagnostic boundaries of neuropsychiatric disorders before discussing ways forward for more directed mechanistic studies to develop stratified, novel therapeutic approaches in the future. 
Calbindin-D28k (CB), one of the major calcium-binding and buffering proteins, has a critical role in preventing a neuronal death as well as maintaining calcium homeostasis. Although marked reductions of CB expression have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unknown whether these changes contribute to AD-related dysfunction. To determine the pathogenic importance of CB depletions in AD models, we crossed 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD; Tg) mice with CB knock-out (CBKO) mice and generated a novel line CBKO·5XFAD (CBKOTg) mice. We first identified the change of signaling pathways and differentially expressed proteins globally by removing CB in Tg mice using mass spectrometry and antibody microarray. Immunohistochemistry showed that CBKOTg mice had significant neuronal loss in the subiculum area without changing the magnitude (number) of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) plaques deposition and elicited significant apoptotic features and mitochondrial dysfunction compared with Tg mice. Moreover, CBKOTg mice reduced levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser-133 and synaptic molecules such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDA receptor 1), NMDA receptor 2A, PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum compared with Tg mice. Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that removal of CB from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, suggesting that CB has a critical role in AD pathogenesis. 
Glutamate release at bipolar to ganglion cell synapses activates NMDA and AMPA/kainic acid (KA) ionotropic glutamate receptors. Their relative strength determines the output signals of the retina. We found that this balance is tightly regulated by presynaptic inhibition that preferentially suppresses NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation. In transient ON-OFF neurons, block of GABA and glycine feedback enhanced total NMDAR charge by 35-fold in the ON response and 9-fold in the OFF compared with a 1.7-fold enhancement of AMPA/KA receptors. Blocking only glycine receptors enhanced the NMDAR excitatory postsynaptic current 10-fold in the ON and 2-fold in the OFF pathway. Blocking GABA(A) or GABA(C) receptors (GABA(C)Rs or GABA(A)Rs) produced small changes in total NMDAR charge. When both GABA(A)Rs and GABA(C)Rs were blocked, the total NMDAR charge increased ninefold in the ON and fivefold in the OFF pathway. This exposed a strong GABA(C)R feedback to bipolar cells that was suppressed by serial amacrine cell synapses mediated by GABA(A)Rs. The results indicate that NMDAR currents are large but latent, held in check by dual GABA and glycine presynaptic inhibition. One example of this controlled NMDAR activation is the cross talk between ON and OFF pathways. Blocking the ON pathway increased NMDAR relative strength in the OFF pathway. Stimulus prolongation similarly increased the NMDAR relative strength in the OFF response. This NMDAR enhancement was produced by a diminution in GABA and glycine feedback. Thus the retinal network recruits NMDAR pathways through presynaptic disinhibition.
Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease. 
Current international guidelines for the risk assessment of biotechnology-derived foods date back to 2003. We present new strategies and directions for assessing immune adverse reactions to novel food proteins. Understanding genetic factors involved in food allergy and the role of the gastrointestinal tract will streamline risk assessment strategies.
A case of sarcoptic mange caused by Trixacarus caviae in a conventional guinea pig breeding colony is reported. The infestation was reported in a large colony of guinea pigs during the month of July, 2013 affecting 30 breeder guinea pigs. Severely infested animals were treated individually with subcutaneous injection of ivermectin 1 % w/v (Neomec®) at the rate of 400 µg/kg body weight 10 days apart. Three doses of ivermectin were sufficient to eliminate the parasite which tested negative after 30 days of the first treatment. The entire colony was given preventive dose of ivermectin spray (2 mg/ml solution) following the same schedule. Strict hygienic measures were followed. New hair growth in the severely affected animals was evidenced on 30th day of treatment.
Known susceptibility loci together can only explain about 6-8% of the disease heritability of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), suggesting that there are still a large number of genetic variants remained to be discovered. We previously identified IgAN and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/lupus nephritis (LN) shared many loci based on GWAS on Chinese populations. The more recent study with high-density genotyping of immune-related loci in individuals with Asian ancestry identified 10 new and 6 suggestive loci in SLE. In the current study, we thus included all the lead SNPs from these 16 loci reported, and firstly tested their associations in 1,248 patients with sporadic IgAN, 737 patients with LN and 1,187 controls. Significant associations identified in IgAN were replicated in additional 500 patients and 2372 controls. rs12022418 in RGS1 (p = 3.0 × 10-6) and rs7170151 in RASGRP1 (p = 1.9 × 10-5) showed novel associations in IgAN. Compared to SNPs that were in LD with them, the associated variants showed higher potential of regulatory features by affecting gene expression. And systemic evaluation of GWAS data supported the pleiotropic effects of RGS1 and RASGRP1 variants in mediating human complex diseases. In conclusion, novel risk loci shared between IgAN and SLE/LN were identified, which may shed new light to exploit the potential pathogenesis for those two diseases.
Early detection of amyloid fibrils is very important for the timely diagnosis of several neurological diseases. Thioflavin-T (ThT) is a gold standard fluorescent probe for amyloid fibrils and has been used for the last few decades. However, due to its positive charge, ThT is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and cannot be used for in vivo imaging of fibrils. In the present work, we synthesized a neutral ThT derivative, 2-[2'-Me,4'-(dimethylamino)phenyl]benzothiazole (2Me-DABT), which showed a strong affinity towards the amyloid fibrils. On association with the amyloid fibrils, 2Me-DABT not only showed a large increase in its emission intensity, but also, unlike ThT, a large blueshift in its emission spectrum was observed. Thus, unlike ThT, 2Me-DABT is a potential candidate for the ratiometric sensor of the amyloid fibrils. Detailed photophysical properties of 2Me-DABT in amyloid fibrils and different solvent media were studied to understand its sensory activity. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies suggested that the sites of localization for ThT and 2Me-DABT in amyloid fibrils are not same and their average distance of separation in amyloid fibrils was determined. The experimental data was nicely supported by molecular docking studies, which confirmed the binding of 2Me-DABT in the inner core of the amyloid fibrils.
Previous studies have shown that human and mouse placentas have hematopoietic potential during mid-gestation. In this investigation, we used histological and immunohistological approaches to visualize hematopoietic cells in mouse placenta between 9.5 and 12.5 days of gestation (gd), identifying their topography and niche. Putative hematopoietic foci were present on 10.5 and 11.5 gd but not 9.5 or 12.5 gd and was restricted to the placental labyrinth. Two major niches each with distinctive hematopoietic cell clusters were present. One type of hematopoietic cell cluster involved the chorioallantoic vasculature and fetal vessels near the chorionic plate. These clusters resembled the hematopoietic stem cells produced by large embryonic arteries such as aorta that persist in postnatal marrow. The other type of hematopoietic cell cluster identified was at the opposite side of labyrinth next to the junctional zone and was composed of erythropoietic foci. Our results suggest that mouse placenta not only produces hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells but also a second wave of primitive erythrocytes that may support a rapid, mid-pregnancy, fetal growth trajectory. Our data also point to a close relationships in the origins of hematopoietic and endothelial cells within placenta.
Phase stability of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) composed of polymer-grafted SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) blended with high-molar-mass host polymer chains is investigated. We focus on blends in which the particle-grafted polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the host-atactic poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) or PMMA/oligo-PEG blends-exhibit favorable enthalpic interactions. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements are used to evaluate the phase stability of the blends and to report on the structure of the materials at intermediate and long length scales. By exploring SiO2-PEG/PMMA and SiO2-PEG/PMMA-PEG systems covering a wide range of molecular weights (Mw) of PMMA (1.1 kDa ≤ Mw,PMMA ≤ 1.1 × 103 kDa) and tethered PEG (0.5 kDa ≤ Mw, PEG ≤ 2 kDa), we are able to develop a comprehensive stability map for PNCs based on hairy NPs. At low Mw,PEG, the phase behavior is dominated by entropic effects and the negative Flory-Huggins χ parameter between PEG and PMMA plays no role in phase stability. For higher Mw,PEO and intermediate Mw,PMMA, a crossover from entropy- to enthalpy-dominated behavior is observed, which leads to the phase stability in PNCs well beyond the conventional limits reported for SiO2-PEG/PEG mixtures. This enhanced mixing ceases above a critical Mw,PMMA, where it is found that PMMA chains wet a sufficiently large number of SiO2-PEG particles to bridge and thereby destabilize the composites.
Ultrafast molecular rotors (UMRs) are reported to be one of the best fluorescent sensors to study different microenvironments, including biomolecules. In the present work, we have explored the possibility of application of a julolidine-based neutral UMR, 9-(2,2-dicyano vinyl) julolidine (DCVJ), as a DNA sensor and studied its mode of binding with DNA in detail using spectroscopic and molecular docking techniques. Our spectroscopic studies indicate that association of DCVJ with DNA leads to a very large enhancement in its emission intensity. Detailed investigation reveals that, despite being a neutral molecule, binding of DCVJ with DNA is largely modulated in the presence of salt. Such an unusual salt effect has been explained by invoking the ion-dipole interaction between DCVJ and the phosphate backbone of DNA. The ion-dipole interaction has also been established by studying the interaction of DCVJ with nucleosides. Detailed time-resolved studies show that the twisting motion around the vinyl bond in DCVJ gets retarded to a great extent because of its association with DNA molecules. Through competitive binding studies, it has also been established that DCVJ also binds to DNA through intercalation. Finally, quantum chemical calculations and molecular docking studies have been performed to confirm the mode of binding of DCVJ with DNA.
Ebola virus disease is one of the deadliest pathogens known to man, with a mortality rate between 25-90% depending on the species and outbreak of Ebola. Typically, it presents with fever, headache, voluminous vomiting and diarrhea, and can progress to a hemorrhagic illness; neurologic symptoms, including meningoencephalitis, seizures, and coma, can also occur. Recently, an outbreak occurred in West Africa, affecting &gt; 28,000 people, and killing &gt; 11,000. Owing to the magnitude of this outbreak, and the large number (&gt;17,000) of Ebola survivors, the medical and scientific communities are learning much more about the acute manifestations and sequelae of Ebola. A number of neurologic complications can occur after Ebola, such as seizures, memory loss, headaches, cranial nerve abnormalities, and tremor. Ebola may also persist in some immunologically privileged sites, including the central nervous system, and can rarely lead to relapse in disease. Owing to these findings, it is important that survivors are evaluated and monitored for neurologic symptoms. Much is unknown about this disease, and treatment remains largely supportive; however, with ongoing clinical and basic science, the mechanisms of how Ebola affects the central nervous system and how it persists after acute disease will hopefully become more clear, and better treatments and clinical practices for Ebola patients will be developed.
We present the first validated metabolic network model for analysis of flux through key pathways of tumor intermediary metabolism, including glycolysis, the oxidative and non-oxidative arms of the pentose pyrophosphate shunt, the TCA cycle as well as its anaplerotic pathways, pyruvate-malate shuttling, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation. The model that is called Bonded Cumomer Analysis for application to (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C MRS) data and Fragmented Cumomer Analysis for mass spectrometric data is a refined and efficient form of isotopomer analysis that can readily be expanded to incorporate glycogen, phospholipid, and other pathways thereby encompassing all the key pathways of tumor intermediary metabolism. Validation was achieved by demonstrating agreement of experimental measurements of the metabolic rates of oxygen consumption, glucose consumption, lactate production, and glutamate pool size with independent measurements of these parameters in cultured human DB-1 melanoma cells. These cumomer models have been applied to studies of DB-1 melanoma and DLCL2 human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells in culture and as xenografts in nude mice at 9.4 T. The latter studies demonstrate the potential translation of these methods to in situ studies of human tumor metabolism by MRS with stable (13)C isotopically labeled substrates on instruments operating at high magnetic fields (≥7 T). The melanoma studies indicate that this tumor line obtains 51% of its ATP by mitochondrial metabolism and 49% by glycolytic metabolism under both euglycemic (5 mM glucose) and hyperglycemic conditions (26 mM glucose). While a high level of glutamine uptake is detected corresponding to ~50% of TCA cycle flux under hyperglycemic conditions, and ~100% of TCA cycle flux under euglycemic conditions, glutaminolysis flux and its contributions to ATP synthesis were very small. Studies of human lymphoma cells demonstrated that inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling produced changes in flux through the glycolytic, pentose shunt, and TCA cycle pathways that were evident within 8 h of treatment and increased at 24 and 48 h. Lactate was demonstrated to be a suitable biomarker of mTOR inhibition that could readily be monitored by (1)H MRS and perhaps also by FDG-PET and hyperpolarized (13)C MRS methods. 
Tuberculosis is very much rampant in our society and accounts for a large number of deaths annually. In spite of consistent efforts being made, the disease has not been curtailed yet. The emergence of MDR and XDR strains in the society along with an increase in the number of HIV cases and that of latent TB, have further aggravated the problem making the disease very much persistent. The current situation clearly manifests the need to discover and develop new potent molecules/approaches that could help to tackle drug resistance. Various molecules, such as derivatives of fluoroquinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and DC-159a), rifamycins (rifapentine), oxazolidinones (linezolid, sutezolid/PNU-100480), diarylquinolines (TMC207/bedaquiline), antifungal azoles, pyrrole (LL3858), nitroimidazopyran (PA824), nitroimidazole (OPC67683, TBA-354), diamine (SQ109) and benzothiazinone (BTZ043) are being developed in an attempt to combat the disease. This review presents a general introduction to the current status of the disease, the biology of the pathogen as well as the state of drug development against tuberculosis (TB) with emphasis on the major problems and bottlenecks associated with the same. Starting from the first drug against TB, the review discusses the entire history and the course of development of the drugs which are available today in the market as well as those which are under various phases of clinical and pre-clinical trials along with their mechanism of action. It also talks about the possible role of nanosciences in combating TB.
Considerable sharing of disease alleles among populations is well-characterized in autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), but there are some exceptional loci showing heterogenic association among populations. Here we investigated genetic variants with distinct effects on the development of rheumatoid arthritis in Asian and European populations. Ancestry-related association heterogeneity was examined using Cochran's homogeneity tests for the disease association data from large Asian (n = 14,465; 9,299 discovery subjects and 5,166 validation subjects; 4 collections) and European (n = 45,790; 11 collections) rheumatoid arthritis case-control cohorts with Immunochip and genome-wide SNP array data. We identified significant heterogeneity between the two ancestries for the common variants in the GTF2I locus (PHeterogeneity = 9.6 × 10(-9) at rs73366469) and showed that this heterogeneity was due to an Asian-specific association effect (ORMeta = 1.37 and PMeta = 4.2 × 10(-13) in Asians; ORMeta = 1.00 and PMeta = 1.00 in Europeans). Trans-ancestral comparison and bioinfomatics analysis revealed a plausibly causal or disease-variant-tagging SNP (rs117026326; in linkage disequilibrium with rs73366469), whose minor allele is common in Asians but rare in Europeans. In conclusion, we identified largest-ever effect on Asian rheumatoid arthritis across human non-HLA regions at GTF2I by heterogeneity mapping followed by replication studies, and pinpointed a possible causal variant.
The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of cold ischaemia time (CIT) on living donor kidney transplant recipients in a large national data set.
Data from the National Health Service Blood and Transplant and UK Renal Registry databases for all patients receiving a living donor kidney transplant in the UK between January 2001 and December 2014 were analysed. Patients were divided into three groups depending on CIT (less than 2 h, 2-4 h, 4-8 h). Risk-adjusted outcomes were assessed by multivariable analysis adjusting for discordance in both donor and recipient characteristics.
Outcomes of 9156 transplants were analysed (CIT less than 2 h in 2662, 2-4 h in 4652, and 4-8 h in 1842). After adjusting for confounders, there was no significant difference in patient survival between CIT groups. Recipients of kidneys with a CIT of 4-8 h had excellent graft outcomes, although these were slightly inferior to outcomes in those with a CIT of less than 2 h, with risk-adjusted rates of delayed graft function of 8·6 versus 4·3 per cent, and 1-year graft survival rates of 96·2 versus 97·1 per cent, respectively.
The detrimental effect of prolonging CIT for up to 8 h in living donation kidney transplantation is marginal.
The large-scale mining and high-throughput genotyping of novel gene-based allelic variants in natural mapping population are essential for association mapping to identify functionally relevant molecular tags governing useful agronomic traits in chickpea. The present study employs an alternative time-saving, non-laborious and economical pool-based EcoTILLING approach coupled with agarose gel detection assay to discover 1133 novel SNP allelic variants from diverse coding and regulatory sequence components of 1133 transcription factor (TF) genes by genotyping in 192 diverse desi and kabuli chickpea accessions constituting a seed weight association panel. Integrating these SNP genotyping data with seed weight field phenotypic information of 192 structured association panel identified eight SNP alleles in the eight TF genes regulating seed weight of chickpea. The associated individual and combination of all SNPs explained 10-15 and 31% phenotypic variation for seed weight, respectively. The EcoTILLING-based large-scale allele mining and genotyping strategy implemented for association mapping is found much effective for a diploid genome crop species like chickpea with narrow genetic base and low genetic polymorphism. This optimized approach thus can be deployed for various genomics-assisted breeding applications with optimal expense of resources in domesticated chickpea. The seed weight-associated natural allelic variants and candidate TF genes delineated have potential to accelerate marker-assisted genetic improvement of chickpea. 
Large volumes of data are continuously generated from clinical notes and diagnostic studies catalogued in electronic health records (EHRs). Echocardiography is one of the most commonly ordered diagnostic tests in cardiology. This study sought to explore the feasibility and reliability of using natural language processing (NLP) for large-scale and targeted extraction of multiple data elements from echocardiography reports. An NLP tool, EchoInfer, was developed to automatically extract data pertaining to cardiovascular structure and function from heterogeneously formatted echocardiographic data sources. EchoInfer was applied to echocardiography reports (2004 to 2013) available from 3 different on-going clinical research projects. EchoInfer analyzed 15,116 echocardiography reports from 1684 patients, and extracted 59 quantitative and 21 qualitative data elements per report. EchoInfer achieved a precision of 94.06%, a recall of 92.21%, and an F1-score of 93.12% across all 80 data elements in 50 reports. Physician review of 400 reports demonstrated that EchoInfer achieved a recall of 92-99.9% and a precision of &gt;97% in four data elements, including three quantitative and one qualitative data element. Failure of EchoInfer to correctly identify or reject reported parameters was primarily related to non-standardized reporting of echocardiography data. EchoInfer provides a powerful and reliable NLP-based approach for the large-scale, targeted extraction of information from heterogeneous data sources. The use of EchoInfer may have implications for the clinical management and research analysis of patients undergoing echocardiographic evaluation.
High dose melphalan (HDM) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) retains a central role in the treatment of myeloma. The aim of this study was to determine whether HDM exposure (area under the concentration vs. time curve, AUC), is significantly associated with transplant outcomes.
Melphalan concentrations were measured in six to 11 plasma samples collected after HDM (median 192 mg m(-) (2) ) to determine melphalan AUC for a total of 114 patients. Binary logistic regression was used to assess whether melphalan AUC was associated with severe (≥ grade 3) oral mucositis. Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess whether melphalan AUC was significantly associated with time to progression, progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).
Melphalan AUC ranged from 4.9 to 24.6 mg l(-1)  h, median 12.84 mg l(-1) h. Melphalan AUC above the median was a risk factor for severe mucositis (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06, 1.38, P = 0.004) but was also associated with significantly improved overall survival (OS) (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20, 0.81, P = 0.001), with an estimated median survival of 8.50 years vs. 5.38 years for high vs. low AUC groups. Multivariate analysis did not identify melphalan AUC as being significantly associated with time to progression or progression-free survival.
This large scale pharmacodynamic analysis of HDM demonstrates that high melphalan exposure is associated with improved survival, with an acceptable increase in transplant toxicity. These results suggest studies targeting a higher AUC are warranted in patients undergoing HDM and ASCT for myeloma.
Receptor-mediated antibody internalization is a key mechanism underlying several anti-cancer antibody therapeutics. Delivering highly toxic drugs to cancer cells, as in the case of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), efficient removal of surface receptors from cancer cells and changing the pharmacokinetics profile of the antibody drugs are some of key ways that internalization impacts the therapeutic efficacy of the antibodies. Over the years, several techniques have been used to study antibody internalization including radiolabels, fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry and cellular toxicity assays. While these methods allow analysis of internalization, they have limitations including a multistep process and limited throughput and are generally endpoint assays. Here, we present a new homogeneous method that enables time and concentration dependent measurements of antibody internalization. The method uses a new hydrophilic and bright pH sensor dye (pHAb dye), which is not fluorescent at neutral pH but becomes highly fluorescent at acidic pH. For receptor mediated antibody internalization studies, antibodies against receptors are conjugated with the pHAb dye and incubated with the cells expressing the receptors. Upon binding to the receptor, the dyes conjugated to the antibody are not fluorescent because of the neutral pH of the media, but upon internalization and trafficking into endosomal and lysosomal vesicles the pH drops and dyes become fluorescent. The enabling attributes of the pHAb dyes are the hydrophilic nature to minimize antibody aggregation and bright fluorescence at acidic pH which allows development of simple plate based assays using a fluorescent reader. Using two different therapeutic antibodies--Trastuzumab (anti-HER2) and Cetuximab (anti-EGFR)--we show labeling with pHAb dye using amine and thiol chemistries and impact of chemistry and dye to antibody ration on internalization. We finally present two new approaches using the pHAb dye, which will be beneficial for screening a large number of antibody samples during early monoclonal development phase.
Central airway collapse greater than 50% of luminal area during exhalation (expiratory central airway collapse [ECAC]) is associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, its prevalence and clinical significance are unknown.
To determine whether ECAC is associated with respiratory morbidity in smokers independent of underlying lung disease.
Analysis of paired inspiratory-expiratory computed tomography images from a large multicenter study (COPDGene) of current and former smokers from 21 clinical centers across the United States. Participants were enrolled from January 2008 to June 2011 and followed up longitudinally until October 2014. Images were initially screened using a quantitative method to detect at least a 30% reduction in minor axis tracheal diameter from inspiration to end-expiration. From this sample of screen-positive scans, cross-sectional area of the trachea was measured manually at 3 predetermined levels (aortic arch, carina, and bronchus intermedius) to confirm ECAC (&gt;50% reduction in cross-sectional area).
Expiratory central airway collapse.
The primary outcome was baseline respiratory quality of life (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ] scale 0 to 100; 100 represents worst health status; minimum clinically important difference [MCID], 4 units). Secondary outcomes were baseline measures of dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] scale 0 to 4; 4 represents worse dyspnea; MCID, 0.7 units), baseline 6-minute walk distance (MCID, 30 m), and exacerbation frequency (events per 100 person-years) on longitudinal follow-up.
The study included 8820 participants with and without COPD (mean age, 59.7 [SD, 6.9] years; 4667 [56.7%] men; 4559 [51.7%] active smokers). The prevalence of ECAC was 5% (443 cases). Patients with ECAC compared with those without ECAC had worse SGRQ scores (30.9 vs 26.5 units; P &lt; .001; absolute difference, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.2-6.6]) and mMRC scale scores (median, 2 [interquartile range [IQR], 0-3]) vs 1 [IQR, 0-3]; P &lt; .001]), but no significant difference in 6-minute walk distance (399 vs 417 m; absolute difference, 18 m [95% CI, 6-30]; P = .30), after adjustment for age, sex, race, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in the first second, pack-years of smoking, and emphysema. On follow-up (median, 4.3 [IQR, 3.2-4.9] years), participants with ECAC had increased frequency of total exacerbations (58 vs 35 events per 100 person-years; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.29-1.72]; P &lt; .001) and severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization (17 vs 10 events per 100 person-years; IRR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.51-2.21]; P &lt; .001).
In a cross-sectional analysis of current and former smokers, the presence of ECAC was associated with worse respiratory quality of life. Further studies are needed to assess long-term associations with clinical outcomes.
It has been previously shown that a Pancharatnam phase device with a dual-twist structure can deflect light up to 60° with nearly perfect efficiency. This was beyond the limits previously assumed for these types of devices, which were considered to be optically similar to Raman-Nath gratings. In this paper we first consider the range of parameters that will allow for high efficiency and show the results for a structure that demonstrates 80° deflection. We then explore the light propagation through these devices to point out interesting intensity variations in the deflected mode of light as it traverses the deflecting layer. Finally, we explain the key to understanding the efficiency of these devices, which is not the typical parameters that are important for traditional diffractive devices, but rather the control of the polarization state of light. We provide a simple design approach for optimizing the twist angle and retardation for high efficiency. 
The objective of this article is to describe the organisation of an international, clinical registry, the Chronic Kidney Disease Observational Database (CKDOD), the processes of enrolling patients and entering data and preliminary results to date.
The Chronic Kidney Disease Observational Database (CKDOD) is designed to assess the association between different factors with a known influence on chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression as well as treatment strategies such as dietary modifications, blood pressure control and pharmacological interventions in Asian countries (India, China, Malaysia and Thailand). The only inclusion criterion is the presence of CKD stage 2 or higher as defined by the KDIGO guidelines. Demographic and clinical information are collected by a standardised electronic questionnaire, available in English and Chinese. The data are transferred to the CKDOD database either by e-mail or via web access. All data are checked for consistency and missing values. Collection of data started in September 2011 and by April 2015, data on 1323 individual patients had been submitted. The mean age at inclusion was 57 ± 14 years, 67 % were male and 36 % were diabetic. The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 26 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Of all enrolled patients, 324 (24 %) received ketoanalogue supplementation during at least one recorded visit.
The CKDOD is a very large and comprehensive data repository, currently focused in subjects recruited from Asia. The database is expected to provide important long-term information on CKD progression, nutritional and metabolic derangements that accompany CKD progression and treatment strategies to ameliorate progression and complications of CKD.
Clinical Trial Registry - India: CTRI/2012/06/002743 ; 25th July 2012.
Bangladesh has been considered as one of the five countries endemic with highly pathogenic avian influenza A subtype H5N1 (HPAI H5N1). Live-bird markets (LBMs) in south Asian countries are believed to play important roles in the transmission of HPAI H5N1 and others due to its central location as a hub of the poultry trading. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has been promoting improved biosecurity in LBMs in Bangladesh. In 2012, by enrolling 32 large LBMs: 10 with FAO interventions and 22 without assistance, we assessed the virus circulation in the selected LBMs by applying standard procedures to investigate market floors, poultry stall floors, poultry-holding cases and slaughter areas and the overall biosecurity using a questionnaire-based survey. Relative risk (RR) was examined to compare the prevalence of HPAI H5N1 in the intervened and non-intervened LBMs. The measures practised in significantly more of the FAO-intervened LBMs included keeping of slaughter remnants in a closed container; decontamination of poultry vehicles at market place; prevention of crows' access to LBM, market/floor cleaning by market committee; wet cleaning; disinfection of floor/poultry stall after cleaning; and good supply of clean water at market (P &lt; 0.05). Conversely, disposal of slaughter remnants elsewhere at market and dry cleaning were in operation in more of the FAO non-intervened LBMs (P &lt; 0.05). The RR for HPAI H5N1 in the intervened and non-intervened LBMs was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.44-2.76), suggesting that the proportion positive of the virus in the two kinds of LBM did not vary significantly (P = 0.413). These observations suggest that the viruses are still maintained at the level of production in farms and circulating in LBMs in Bangladesh regardless of interventions, albeit at lower levels than in other endemic countries.
Pulmonary function decline is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality among smokers. Post bronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio are considered the standard assessment of airflow obstruction. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 9919 current and former smokers in the COPDGene study (6659 non-Hispanic Whites [NHW] and 3260 African Americans [AA]) to identify associations with spirometric measures (post-bronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC). We also conducted meta-analysis of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC GWAS in the COPDGene, ECLIPSE, and GenKOLS cohorts (total n = 13,532).
Among NHW in the COPDGene cohort, both measures of pulmonary function were significantly associated with SNPs at the 15q25 locus [containing CHRNA3/5, AGPHD1, IREB2, CHRNB4] (lowest p-value = 2.17 × 10(-11)), and FEV1/FVC was associated with a genomic region on chromosome 4 [upstream of HHIP] (lowest p-value = 5.94 × 10(-10)); both regions have been previously associated with COPD. For the meta-analysis, in addition to confirming associations to the regions near CHRNA3/5 and HHIP, genome-wide significant associations were identified for FEV1 on chromosome 1 [TGFB2] (p-value = 8.99 × 10(-9)), 9 [DBH] (p-value = 9.69 × 10(-9)) and 19 [CYP2A6/7] (p-value = 3.49 × 10(-8)) and for FEV1/FVC on chromosome 1 [TGFB2] (p-value = 8.99 × 10(-9)), 4 [FAM13A] (p-value = 3.88 × 10(-12)), 11 [MMP3/12] (p-value = 3.29 × 10(-10)) and 14 [RIN3] (p-value = 5.64 × 10(-9)).
In a large genome-wide association study of lung function in smokers, we found genome-wide significant associations at several previously described loci with lung function or COPD. We additionally identified a novel genome-wide significant locus with FEV1 on chromosome 9 [DBH] in a meta-analysis of three study populations.
Epidemiological studies carried out using culture or microscopy in most of the amoebiasis endemic developing countries, yielded confusing results since none of these could differentiate the pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica from the non-pathogenic Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii. The Northeastern part of India is a hot spot of infection since the climatic conditions are most conducive for the infection and so far no systemic study has been carried out in this region.
Following a cross-sectional study designed during the period 2011-2014, a total of 1260 fecal samples collected from the Northeast Indian population were subjected to microscopy, fecal culture and a sensitive and specific DNA dot blot screening assay developed in our laboratory targeting the Entamoeba spp. Further species discrimination using PCR assay performed in microscopy, culture and DNA dot blot screening positive samples showed E. histolytica an overall prevalence rate of 11.1%, 8.0% and 13.7% respectively. In addition, infection rates of nonpathogenic E. dispar and E. moshkovskii were 11.8% (95% CI = 10.2, 13.8) and 7.8% (95% CI = 6.4, 9.4) respectively. The spatial distributions of infection were 18.2% (107/588) of Assam, 11.7% (23/197) of Manipur, 10.2% (21/207) of Meghalaya, and 8.2% (22/268) of Tripura states. Association study of the disease with demographic features suggested poor living condition (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 1.83, 5.63), previous history of infection in family member (OR = 3.18; 95% CI = 2.09, 4.82) and unhygienic toilet facility (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.28, 2.49) as significant risk factors for amoebiasis. Children in age group &lt;15 yr, participants having lower levels of education, and daily laborers exhibited a higher infection rate.
Despite the importance of molecular diagnosis of amoebiasis, molecular epidemiological data based on a large sample size from endemic countries are rarely reported in the literature. Improved and faster method of diagnosis employed here to dissect out the pathogenic from the nonpathogenic species would help the clinicians to prescribe the appropriate anti-amoebic drug.
The presence of the HLA-B*27 allele is a major risk factor for the development of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), which causes chronic inflammation of the spine and other sites. We investigated residual effects outside HLA-B within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in the Korean population.
Using the Korean HLA reference panel, we inferred the classic HLA alleles and amino-acid residues of the six HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, and -DRB1) and MHC single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 3820 Korean subjects, including 654 Korean cases of AS and 3166 controls, who were genotyped by using Immunochip. Logistic regression and log-likelihood ratio tests were used in AS association tests for imputed markers.
The most significant associations were identified at amino-acid positions in the epitope-binding site of HLA-B (P = 1.71 × 10(-481) at position 70, P = 7.20 × 10(-479) at position 97, and P = 2.54 × 10(-484) at positions 114), highlighting the risk effect of the HLA-B*27 allele and the protective effects of other classic alleles. A secondary effect was located at the leucine at amino-acid position 116 in the epitope-binding site of HLA-C (P = 1.69 × 10(-14)), completely tagging the HLA-C*15:02 allele. This residue had a large effect in HLA-B*27-negative patients (odds ratio = 6.6, 95 % confidence interval = 3.8 to 11.4).
The four amino-acid positions of HLA-B and -C account for most of the associations between AS and MHC in the Korean population. This finding updates the list of AS susceptibility loci and provides new insight into AS pathogenesis mediated by MHC class I molecules.
To establish the level of observer variation for the current ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT criteria for a diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on CT among a large group of thoracic radiologists of varying levels of experience.
112 observers (96 of whom were thoracic radiologists) categorised CTs of 150 consecutive patients with fibrotic lung disease using the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT CT criteria for a UIP pattern (3 categories--UIP, possibly UIP and inconsistent with UIP). The presence of honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis and emphysema was also scored using a 3-point scale (definitely present, possibly present, absent). Observer agreement for the UIP categorisation and for the 3 CT patterns in the entire observer group and in subgroups stratified by observer experience, were evaluated.
Interobserver agreement across the diagnosis category scores among the 112 observers was moderate, ranging from 0.48 (IQR 0.18) for general radiologists to 0.52 (IQR 0.20) for thoracic radiologists of 10-20 years' experience. A binary score for UIP versus possible or inconsistent with UIP was examined. Observer agreement for this binary score was only moderate. No significant differences in agreement levels were identified when the CTs were stratified according to multidisciplinary team (MDT) diagnosis or patient age or when observers were categorised according to experience. Observer agreement for each of honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis and emphysema were 0.59±0.12, 0.42±0.15 and 0.43±0.18, respectively.
Interobserver agreement for the current ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT CT criteria for UIP is only moderate among thoracic radiologists, irrespective of their experience, and did not vary with patient age or the MDT diagnosis.
Secondary batteries based on lithium are the most important energy storage technology for contemporary portable devices. The lithium ion battery (LIB) in widespread commercial use today is a compromise technology. It compromises high energy, high power, and design flexibility for long cell operating lifetimes and safety. Materials science, transport phenomena, and electrochemistry in the electrodes and electrolyte that constitute such batteries are areas of active study worldwide because significant improvements in storage capacity and cell lifetime are required to meet new demands, including the electrification of transportation and for powering emerging autonomous aircraft and robotics technologies. By replacing the carbonaceous host material used as the anode in an LIB with metallic lithium, rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with higher storage capacity and compatibility with low-cost, high-energy, unlithiated cathodes such as sulfur, manganese dioxide, carbon dioxide, and oxygen become possible. Large-scale, commercial deployment of LMBs are today limited by safety concerns associated with unstable electrodeposition and lithium dendrite formation during cell recharge. LMBs are also limited by low cell operating lifetimes due to parasitic chemical reactions between the electrode and electrolyte. These concerns are greater in rechargeable batteries that utilize other, more earth abundant metals such as sodium and to some extent even aluminum. Inspired by early theoretical works, various strategies have been proposed for alleviating dendrite proliferation in LMBs. A commonly held view among these early studies is that a high modulus, solid-state electrolyte that facilitates fast ion transport, is nonflammable, and presents a strong-enough physical barrier to dendrite growth is a requirement for any commercial LMB. Unfortunately, poor room-temperature ionic conductivity, challenging processing, and the high cost of ceramic electrolytes that meet the modulus and stability requirements have to date proven to be insurmountable obstacles to progress. In this Account, we first review recent advances in continuum theory for dendrite growth and proliferation during metal electrodeposition. We show that the range of options for designing electrolytes and separators that stabilize electrodeposition is now substantially broader than one might imagine from previous literature accounts. In particular, separators designed at the nanoscale to constrain ion transport on length scales below a theory-defined cutoff, and structured electrolytes in which a fraction of anions are permanently immobilized to nanoparticles, to a polymer network or ceramic membrane are considered particularly promising for their ability to stabilize electrodeposition of lithium metal without compromising ionic conductivity or room temperature battery operation. We also review recent progress in designing surface passivation films for metallic lithium that facilitate fast deposition of lithium at the electrolyte/electrode interface and at the same time protect the lithium from parasitic side reactions with liquid electrolytes. A promising finding from both theory and experiment is that simple film-forming halide salt additives in a conventional liquid electrolyte can substantially extend the lifetime and safety of LMBs. 
There is wide variation in the phenotypic expression of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is driven by both genetic and epidemiological influences.
To define and explain variation in the clinical phenotype of PD, in relation to genotypic variation.
Tracking Parkinson's is a multicentre prospective longitudinal epidemiologic and biomarker study of PD. Patients attending specialist clinics in the United Kingdom with recent onset (&lt;3.5 years) and young onset (diagnosed &lt;50 years of age) PD were enrolled. Motor, non-motor and quality of life assessments were performed using validated scales. Cases are followed up 6 monthly up to 4.5 years for recent onset PD, and up to 1 year for young onset PD. We present here baseline clinical data from this large and demographically representative cohort.
2247 PD cases were recruited (1987 recent onset, 260 young onset). Recent onset cases had a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 67.6 years (9.3) at study entry, 65.7% males, with disease duration 1.3 years (0.9), MDS-UPDRS 3 scores 22.9 (12.3), LEDD 295 mg/day (211) and PDQ-8 score 5.9 (4.8). Young onset cases were 53.5 years old (7.8) at study entry, 66.9% male, with disease duration 10.2 years (6.7), MDS-UPDRS 3 scores 27.4 (15.3), LEDD 926 mg/day (567) and PDQ-8 score 11.6 (6.1).
We have established a large clinical PD cohort, consisting of young onset and recent onset cases, which is designed to evaluate variation in clinical expression, in relation to genetic influences, and which offers a platform for future imaging and biomarker research.
Eumycetoma is an unusual infection in immunocompromised patients outside the tropics, caused by a variety of fungal pathogens. We describe the case of a 51-year-old renal transplant recipient who presented with a large pseudotumoral foot lesion necessitating complete surgical excision of the lesion. Cultures and molecular diagnosis confirmed Phaeoacremonium fuscum. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of fungating mycetoma caused by this fungal species in a solid organ transplant recipient. 
Renal replacement therapy using dialysis has evolved dramatically over recent years with an improvement in patient survival. With this increased longevity, a cohort of patients are in the precarious position of having exhausted the standard routes of vascular access. The extent of this problem of failed access or 'desperate measures' access is difficult to determine, as there are no uniform definitions or classification allowing standardization and few studies have been performed. The aim of this study is to propose a classification of end-stage vascular access (VA) failure and subsequently test its applicability in a dialysis population.
Using anatomical stratification, a simple hierarchical classification is proposed. This has been applied to a large dialysis population and in particular to patients referred to the complex access clinic dedicated to patients identified as having exhausted standard VA options and also those dialysing on permanent central venous catheters (CVC).
A simple classification is proposed based on a progressive anatomical grading of (I) standard upper arm options exhausted, (II) femoral options exhausted and (III) other options exhausted. These are further subdivided anatomically to allow ease of classification. When applied to a complex group of patients (n = 145) referred to a dedicated complex access clinic, 21 patients were Class I, 26 Class II and 2 Class III. Ninety-six patients did not fall into the classification despite being referred as permanent CVC.
The numbers of patients who have exhausted definitive access options will continue to increase. This simple classification allows the scope of the problem and proposed solutions to be identified. Furthermore, these solutions can be studied and treatments compared in a standardized fashion. The classification may also be applied if patients have the option of transplantation where iliac vessel preservation is desirable and prioritization policies may be instituted.
To determine the type, prevalence, intensity and the potential risk factors for helminths infection harboured by primary school aged children from selected schools of Delhi, India. Stool samples collected from 347 boys and girls studying in grades I-IV (aged 5-15 years) were examined by the semi-quantitative Kato-Katz method for presence of eggs of soil-transmitted helminths. Questionnaire data on the potential risk factors, associated variables and consequences of infection were categorized as individual, household, hygiene/sanitation related and behavioural factors. Associations between infection and these factors were assessed by multiple logistic regressions. The overall prevalence of infection with any of the helminths was 29.7 %. The prevalence of single infection with Ascaris lumbricoides was 8.1 % while that of hookworm and Trichuris trichiura was 3.7 % each. Strongest predictors for the helminths presence were never deworming (OR = 1.76; 95 % CI: 1.05, 2.95), no facility for defection (OR = 4.31; 95 % CI: 1.22, 15.22), using left hand for cleaning anal region (OR = 2.01; 95 % CI: 1.18, 3.43) and not reporting pain in stomach (OR = 1.93; 95 % CI: 1.14, 3.26). Though the infection intensities were low, we highlighted some of the potential risk factors that increase the susceptibility to these infections. Periodic deworming along with improvement in hygiene and sanitation practices through concerted efforts, not only from the school infrastructure but also the community at large, will help prevent helminths transmission and reinfection. 
The O antigen (Oag) component of Shigella flexneri lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is important for virulence and a protective antigen. It is synthesized by the Wzy-dependent mechanism. S. flexneri Wzy has 12 transmembrane segments and two large periplasmic loops. The modal chain length of the Oag is determined by Wzz. Experimental evidence supports multi-protein interactions in the Wzy-dependent pathway. However, evidence for direct interaction of Wzy with the other proteins of the Wzy-dependent pathway is limited. Initially, we purified Wzy-GFP-His8 and detected the presence of a dimeric form. In vivo cross-linking was then performed in an S. flexneri wzy mutant strain carrying plasmids encoding Wzy-GFP-His8 and untagged Wzz. Following solubilization with n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) and affinity purification of Wzy-GFP-His8, Western immunoblotting with Wzz antibody detected co-purification of Wzz; this was supported by MS analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported isolation of a complex between Wzy and Wzz. Wzy mutants (WzyR164A, WzyV92M, WzyY137H, and WzyR250K) whose properties are affected by Wzz were able to form complexes with Wzz. Their mutational alterations did not affect the interaction of Wzy with Wzz. Thus, the interaction may involve many regions of Wzy.
As renal transplantation continues to evolve, there appears to be a change in both donor and recipient populations. Traditional markers of high-risk donor (e.g. donation after cardiac death [DCD]/expanded criteria donor [ECD]) and recipient (e.g. obese, highly sensitized) operations appear to be more common without any noticeable worsening of patient outcome. The present study aimed to compare outcome and define the change in donor and recipient populations for cadaveric transplants over a 10-year period at a large U.K. center.
Single-center analysis of all adult patients undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation between January 2004 and January 2014 (n = 754). Transplants were divided into 3 groups (early, middle, and late) depending on the era, with donor, recipient and outcomes compared.
There were considerable changes in both donor and recipient factors between the 3 eras, with a greater proportion of high-risk operations performed, as reflected by significant increases in Donor Risk Index (median: 1.11-1.16, P = .022), and the proportions of ECD (22.2%-33.9%, P = .003) and DCD kidneys (10.8%-19.4% P = .011). However, 1-year graft survival was comparable between the eras, with a decrease in the average 1-year serum creatinine between the early and late cohort (median: 161 μmol/L vs 132 μmol/L, P &lt; .001). There was no significant increase in body mass index (BMI) in either the donor or recipient population across the eras.
Improvement in transplant outcome continues despite a greater proportion of transplants previously considered as high risk being performed. This is likely to reflect a considerable improvement in pre- and postoperative management. BMI remains a major continuing block to transplantation.
In this communication, using sub-picosecond resolved fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy, we discover that despite a large fluorescence enhancement observed for thioflavin-T in insulin fibrils, the majority of fibril bound thioflavin-T undergoes efficient ultrafast conformational relaxation, and thus does not contribute to the characteristic fluorescence enhancement. 
A large number of phaeoid fungi cause infection in humans and other animals which is characterized by the basic development of sclerotic body, dark-coloured filamentous hyphae as well as yeast-like cells in the invaded tissue. Two cases of subcutaneous mycosis in immunocompetent male patients aged 55 and 58 years attending Dermatology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Assam, north-east India, are reported. The first case was diagnosed as chromoblastomycosis which was caused by Cladosporium cladosporioides. The patient clinically presented with a chronic verrucous and nodular growth of 32-year duration on the left foot and leg. Identification of the species was done by sequencing the D1/D2 region of LSU (large subunit 28S rDNA). The patient was treated with surgical resection and oral itraconazole which showed good clinical response and total regression of lesion after 9 months. The second case due to Bipolaris cynodontis presented as verrucous exophytic growth over the dorsum of the right foot of 1-year duration which was diagnosed as chromoblastomycosis. The identification of the species was done by sequencing the ITS region. The patient was started with oral itraconazole but was lost to follow-up. Chromoblastomycosis due to Cladosporium cladosporioides is rare. Bipolaris cynodontis is not yet reported as a cause of human infection. The aetiological role of this fungus was confirmed by repeated isolation of the fungus from the lesion and direct microscopy. Molecular identification methods can increase the spectrum of black moulds causing human infection in coming years. We are reporting these two cases with review of the available literature.
Screening for lung cancer using low-dose computed tomography (CT) reduces lung cancer mortality. However, in addition to a high rate of benign nodules, lung cancer screening detects a large number of indolent cancers that generally belong to the adenocarcinoma spectrum. Individualized management of screen-detected adenocarcinomas would be facilitated by noninvasive risk stratification.
To validate that Computer-Aided Nodule Assessment and Risk Yield (CANARY), a novel image analysis software, successfully risk stratifies screen-detected lung adenocarcinomas based on clinical disease outcomes.
We identified retrospective 294 eligible patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions in the low-dose CT arm of the National Lung Screening Trial. The last low-dose CT scan before the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma was analyzed using CANARY blinded to clinical data. Based on their parametric CANARY signatures, all the lung adenocarcinoma nodules were risk stratified into three groups. CANARY risk groups were compared using survival analysis for progression-free survival.
A total of 294 patients were included in the analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis of all the 294 adenocarcinoma nodules stratified into the Good, Intermediate, and Poor CANARY risk groups yielded distinct progression-free survival curves (P &lt; 0.0001). This observation was confirmed in the unadjusted and adjusted (age, sex, race, and smoking status) progression-free survival analysis of all stage I cases.
CANARY allows the noninvasive risk stratification of lung adenocarcinomas into three groups with distinct post-treatment progression-free survival. Our results suggest that CANARY could ultimately facilitate individualized management of incidentally or screen-detected lung adenocarcinomas.
A 22-year-old woman with severe mitral stenosis was referred to us for further evaluation and management. She was found to have severe mitral stenosis, severe tricuspid regurgitation with dilated right atrium and right ventricle with persistent left superior vena cava and hugely dilated coronary sinus. Valve was suitable for balloon mitral valvotomy. Cardiac catheterization showed interrupted inferior vena cava with azygos continuation to right atrium and large left superior vena cava draining to coronary sinus which was very much dilated. Right trans-jugular approach was tried for balloon mitral valvotomy, but was unsuccessful due to a very large right atrium and coronary sinus. Retrograde non trans-septal approach was used and balloon valvotomy was done successfully using a 24 mm × 40 mm TYSHAK balloon without any major complication. Reduction in the transmitral pressure gradient on cardiac catheterization data and transthoracic echocardiography confirmed successful procedure. Balloon mitral valvotomy can be done successfully in patients with the above unusual cardiac anatomy with no major procedural complications.
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a peptide hormone whose pathological self-assembly is a hallmark of the progression of type II diabetes. IAPP-membrane interactions catalyze its higher-order self-assembly and also underlie its toxic effects toward cells. While there is great interest in developing small molecule reagents capable of altering the structure and behavior of oligomeric, membrane-bound IAPP, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of this ensemble makes it recalcitrant to traditional approaches. Here, we build on recent insights into the nature of membrane-bound states and develop a combined computational and experimental strategy to address this problem. The generalized structural approach efficiently identified diverse compounds from large commercial libraries with previously unrecognized activities toward the gain-of-function behaviors of IAPP. The use of appropriate computational prescreening reduced the experimental burden by orders of magnitude relative to unbiased high-throughput screening. We found that rationally targeting experimentally derived models of membrane-bound dimers identified several compounds that demonstrate the remarkable ability to enhance IAPP-membrane binding and one compound that enhances IAPP-mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, these findings imply that membrane binding per se is insufficient to generate cytotoxicity; instead, enhanced sampling of rare states within the membrane-bound ensemble may potentiate IAPP's toxic effects. 
The objective of the present study was to know the perceptions of students regarding objective structured practical examination (OSPE) as a tool for assessment in Forensic Medicine. The present study was conducted in the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute (MGMCRI), Pondicherry, India. Undergraduate medical students of the 4th semester were enrolled in the study to know their perceptions regarding OSPE. The students were briefed regarding OSPE with a PowerPoint presentation and interaction. An examination was conducted using OSPE with10 stations and a total of 74 students participated in the study. The feedback was collected using a preformed proforma consisting of 12 items and analyzed. Most of the participants (82.4%) agreed that OSPE is a better method of examination than the conventional/traditional practical examination. The majority of the participants (77.0%) said that the OSPE covered wide range of knowledge than the conventional practical examination. A large number of students (63.5%) were of the opinion that the OSPE may be exhausting and stressful if number of stations are increased. Overall a larger proportion of the participants preferred OSPE over the conventional practical examination considering the various attributes examined in the study. 
Model organisms are of great importance to our understanding of basic biology and to making advances in biomedical research. However, the influence of laboratory cultivation on these organisms is underappreciated, and especially how that environment can affect research outcomes. Recent experiments led to insights into how the widely used laboratory reference strain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans compares with natural strains. Here we describe potential selective pressures that led to the fixation of laboratory-derived alleles for the genes npr-1, glb-5, and nath-10. These alleles influence a large number of traits, resulting in behaviors that affect experimental interpretations. Furthermore, strong phenotypic effects caused by these laboratory-derived alleles hinder the discovery of natural alleles. We highlight strategies to reduce the influence of laboratory-derived alleles and to harness the full power of C. elegans. 
Farming is a large and main industry in Bangladesh. Large numbers of people are directly involved in farming and have very unique exposure compare to other sectors. Musculoskeletal problems among farmer population are not infrequent. This study was carried out among 200 farmers in one selected district. The study revealed that musculoskeletal problems were common among the farmers working in a traditional way. All the respondents were male. The age of all respondents lie between 20-60 years. Among them 22.5% farmers were illiterate, about 45.5% below Class V. About half (42%) of the respondents had reported pain in different parts of the body at least one or more times during working in land. And about two third (65.5%) of the farmers had history of joint pain and stiffness in last 12 month. Most of the farmers who suffered from musculoskeletal symptoms were 41-60 years. Specially who worked more then 20 years (82.6%) and average 6 hours per day (66.7%). The occurrence of musculoskeletal problems in various part of the body included Knee pain - 48.1%, Back pain (back ache) - 22.9%, Waist pain (low back ache) - 13.3%, Neck pain - 18.3% and shoulder pain - 10.7%. Length of work in year and daily average working hours were found significant association with musculoskeletal pain. It was found that musculoskeletal pain were more common among the farmers when they worked in squatting position (52%) and specially during weeding of plants (31%). Among them only 22% also engaged in other business. Most of the farmers complained dull aching pain (40.6%), only 2.3% noticed severe acute pain, but about 86% farmers' temporary stop their work for pain and 80% get relief after discontinue of work. About 75% respondents visited doctors for their pain which was statistically significant (p=0.001). It was found that the rates of musculoskeletal complaints are more among those individuals who worked relatively bad ergonomic condition, such as body position probably play an important role. 
Small animal models of lung fibrosis are essential for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying human fibrotic lung diseases; additionally, they are useful for preclinical testing of candidate antifibrotic agents. The current end-point measures of experimental lung fibrosis involve labor-intensive histological and biochemical analyses. These measures fail to account for dynamic changes in the disease process in individual animals and are limited by the need for large numbers of animals for longitudinal studies. The emergence of noninvasive imaging technologies provides exciting opportunities to image lung fibrosis in live animals as often as needed and to longitudinally track the efficacy of novel antifibrotic compounds. Data obtained by noninvasive imaging provide complementary information to histological and biochemical measurements. In addition, the use of noninvasive imaging in animal studies reduces animal usage, thus satisfying animal welfare concerns. In this article, we review these new imaging modalities with the potential for evaluation of lung fibrosis in small animal models. Such techniques include micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and multimodal imaging systems including PET/CT and SPECT/CT. It is anticipated that noninvasive imaging will be increasingly used in animal models of fibrosis to gain insights into disease pathogenesis and as preclinical tools to assess drug efficacy. 
Virtually all organisms seek to maximize fitness by matching fuel availability with energy expenditure. In vertebrates, glucose homeostasis is central to this process, with glucose levels finely tuned to match changing energy requirements. To discover new pathways regulating glucose levels in vivo, we performed a large-scale chemical screen in live zebrafish and identified the small molecule alexidine as a potent glucose-lowering agent. We found that alexidine inhibits the PTEN-like mitochondrial phosphatase PTPMT1 and that other pharmacological and genetic means of inactivating PTPMT1 also decrease glucose levels in zebrafish. Mutation of ptpmt1 eliminates the effect of alexidine, further confirming it as the glucose-lowering target of alexidine. We then identified succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) as a substrate of PTPMT1. Inactivation of PTPMT1 causes hyperphosphorylation and activation of SDH, providing a possible mechanism by which PTPMT1 coordinates glucose homeostasis. Therefore, PTPMT1 appears to be an important regulator of SDH phosphorylation status and glucose concentration.
Human disease specific neuronal cultures are essential for generating in vitro models for human neurological diseases. However, the lack of access to primary human adult neural cultures raises unique challenges. Recent developments in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provides an alternative approach to derive neural cultures from skin fibroblasts through patient specific iPSC, but this process is labor intensive, requires special expertise and large amounts of resources, and can take several months. This prevents the wide application of this technology to the study of neurological diseases. To overcome some of these issues, we have developed a method to derive neural stem cells directly from human adult peripheral blood, bypassing the iPSC derivation process. Hematopoietic progenitor cells enriched from human adult peripheral blood were cultured in vitro and transfected with Sendai virus vectors containing transcriptional factors Sox2, Oct3/4, Klf4, and c-Myc. The transfection results in morphological changes in the cells which are further selected by using human neural progenitor medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The resulting cells are characterized by the expression for neural stem cell markers, such as nestin and SOX2. These neural stem cells could be further differentiated to neurons, astroglia and oligodendrocytes in specified differentiation media. Using easily accessible human peripheral blood samples, this method could be used to derive neural stem cells for further differentiation to neural cells for in vitro modeling of neurological disorders and may advance studies related to the pathogenesis and treatment of those diseases. 
The O antigen (Oag) component of LPS is a major Shigella flexneri virulence determinant. Oag is polymerized by WzySf, and its modal chain length is determined by WzzSf and WzzpHS2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on wzySf in pWaldo-wzySf-TEV-GFP to alter Arg residues in WzySf's two large periplasmic loops (PLs) (PL3 and PL5). Analysis of the LPS profiles conferred by mutated WzySf proteins in the wzySf deficient (Δwzy) strain identified residues that affect WzySf activity. The importance of the guanidium group of the Arg residues was investigated by altering the Arg residues to Lys and Glu, which generated WzySf mutants conferring altered LPS Oag modal chain lengths. The dependence of these WzySf mutants on WzzSf was investigated by expressing them in a wzySf and wzzSf deficient (Δwzy Δwzz) strain. Comparison of the LPS profiles identified a role for the Arg residues in the association of WzySf and WzzSf during Oag polymerization. Colicin E2 and bacteriophage Sf6c susceptibility supported this conclusion. Comparison of the expression levels of different mutant WzySf-GFPs with the wild-type WzySf-GFP showed that certain Arg residues affected production levels of WzySf in a WzzSf-dependent manner. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. flexneri WzySf mutants having an effect on LPS Oag modal chain length, and identified functionally significant Arg residues in WzySf. 
Formation of a ternary complex by an ultrafast molecular rotor (UMR) with a macrocyclic cavitand has been investigated for the sensitive detection of the alkyl chain of a surfactant. A benzothiazole based UMR, Thioflavin-T (ThT), has been used as a fluorescent probe. It is shown that ThT forms a very weak inclusion complex with γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) with an association constant of 8.8 M(-1). However, the addition of a small amount of surfactant results in a significant increase in the emission intensity of ThT in γ-CD solution. From detailed steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and NMR studies, it has been inferred that the addition of the surfactant results in the formation of a ternary complex through the inclusion of its alkyl chain inside the γ-CD nanocavity. In such a ternary complex, the non-radiative torsional motion in ThT is largely prevented due to a large increase in the frictional force inside the nanocavity and results in a significant fluorescence enhancement. The formation of the binary and the ternary complexes in the present system has been further supported by the molecular docking and subsequent molecular dynamics simulation studies. The present result indicates that the inclusion complex with an UMR as a guest could be a potential candidate for the efficient detection of insoluble organic molecules, especially hydrocarbons. 
Genome wide association studies have identified variants in PXK that confer risk for humoral autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), rheumatoid arthritis and more recently systemic sclerosis. While PXK is involved in trafficking of epidermal growth factor Receptor (EGFR) in COS-7 cells, mechanisms linking PXK to lupus pathophysiology have remained undefined. In an effort to uncover the mechanism at this locus that increases lupus-risk, we undertook a fine-mapping analysis in a large multi-ancestral study of lupus patients and controls. We define a large (257kb) common haplotype marking a single causal variant that confers lupus risk detected only in European ancestral populations and spans the promoter through the 3' UTR of PXK. The strongest association was found at rs6445972 with P &lt; 4.62 × 10(-10), OR 0.81 (0.75-0.86). Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, we demonstrate that one signal drives the genetic association in the region. Bayesian analysis confirms our results, identifying a 95% credible set consisting of 172 variants spanning 202 kb. Functionally, we found that PXK operates on the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR); we confirmed that PXK influenced the rate of BCR internalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals carrying the risk haplotype exhibited a decreased rate of BCR internalization, a process known to impact B cell survival and cell fate. Taken together, these data define a new candidate mechanism for the genetic association of variants around PXK with lupus risk and highlight the regulation of intracellular trafficking as a genetically regulated pathway mediating human autoimmunity. 
The objective of this study was to examine a large institutional experience of patients with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 in the setting of comorbid congenital heart disease and present the outcomes of surgical versus expectant management. It is a retrospective single-institution cohort study. Institutional review board approved this study. Thirteen consecutive trisomy 18 patients and three consecutive trisomy 13 patients (sixteen patients in total) with comorbid congenital heart disease who were evaluated by our institution's Division of Cardiovascular Surgery between January 2008 and December 2013 were included in the study. The primary outcome measures evaluated were operative mortality (for patients who received surgical management), overall mortality (for patients who received expectant management), and total length of survival during follow-up. Of the thirteen trisomy 18 patients, seven underwent surgical management and six received expectant management. With surgical management, operative mortality was 29 %, and 80 % of patients were alive after a median follow-up of 116 days. With expectant management, 50 % of patients died before hospital discharge. Of the three patients with trisomy 13, one patient underwent surgical management and two received expectant management. The patient who received surgical management with complete repair was alive at last follow-up over 2 years after surgery; both patients managed expectantly died before hospital discharge. Trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 patients with comorbid congenital heart disease can undergo successful cardiac surgical intervention. In this population, we advocate that nearly all patients with cardiovascular indications for operative congenital heart disease intervention should be offered complete surgical repair over palliative approaches for moderately complex congenital cardiac anomalies.
Enteric fever is a systemic disease caused by Salmonella organism such as serotypes Typhi and ParaTyphi A, B, C. Salmonella ParaTyphi A contributes more than 50% of all the enteric fever cases and it has recently been projected as an emerging pathogen.
The present study was aimed to detect Salmonella Typhi and ParaTyphi A in urine, blood and stool specimens collected from cases of enteric fever (110), chronic typhoid carriers (46) and healthy controls (75) to explore the possibility of mixed infection by nested PCR. A new nested PCR primer was designed targeting putative fimbrial protein (stkG) gene which is one of the fimbrial gene families to Salmonella ParaTyphi A and for S. Typhi already reported primers targeting flagellin (fliC) gene.
Large volume of urine specimens (15 ml) was found to be the best for detection of Salmonella serotypes. The urine sample was found to have mixed-infection by both the serotypes in 40.9% of the cases but lower in blood (27.3%) and stool (13.6%).
The present study concludes that occurrence of mixed infection may be quite frequent in typhoid and chronic typhoid carriers' individuals, although the reported recent rise in ParaTyphi A incidence may not be real.
Small-scale hydraulics is ideal for powered human assistive devices including powered ankle foot orthoses because a large torque can be generated with an actuator that is small and light. A portable hydraulic ankle foot orthosis has been designed and is undergoing preliminary prototyping and engineering bench test evaluation. The device provides 90 Nm of ankle torque and has an operating pressure of 138 bar (2,000 psi). The battery-operated hydraulic power supply weighs about 3 kg and is worn at the waist. The ankle component weighs about 1.2 Kg and connects to the power supply with two hoses. Performance simulation and preliminary bench testing suggests that the device could be useful in certain rehabilitation applications. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a kind of short non-coding RNAs, of about 22 nucleotides in length, which modulate and sometimes degrade the target mRNAs thereby regulating a number of cellular functions. Recent research in this area establishes the involvement of miRNAs in various disease progressions, including certain types of cancer development. Further, genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs has been proven to be useful for differentiating various cancer types. In this paper, we have used miRNA expression profiles over a large set of breast cancer tumor samples for identifying subtypes of breast cancers. The experimental results demonstrate that miRNAs carry a unique signature that distinguishes cancer subtypes and reveal new cancer subtypes. Additional survival analyses based on clinical data also strengthen this claim. 
A large group of ethnic communities living in Unakoti district of Tripura, India is still dependent on traditional herbal remedies for treatment of diabetes. Valuable information collected from these communities in the present investigation is important in maintaining their indigenous knowledge of folklore medicine.
Systematic and extensive field surveys were conducted during 2011-2013 among the ethnic inhabitants of Unokati district, Tripura, India covering all the seasons to collect information on their traditional herbal medication system for treatment of diabetes. Obtained data were analysed through fidelity level (FL), use value (UV) and relative frequency of citation (RFC) to authenticate the uniqueness of the species being used for diabetes treatment.
In this current study a total of 39 medicinal plant species belonging to 37 genera and 28 families were presented, used by the traditional healers of Unakoti district, Tripura, India for diabetes treatment. FL, UV and RFC values of collected plants for the selected study area ranges between 06% and 100%, 0.07% and 2.64% and 0.02% and 0.51% respectively. Out of 39 collected plants, 11, 5 and 3 plant species have showed significant (&lt;50%) FL, UV and RFC values respectively.
Like many other ethnic communities of the world, inhabitants of Unakoti district depend on a traditional medication system to treat diabetes. Documented floras are locally available and need proper further pharmacological validation to endorse their traditional use in a modern health care system. This will help in the development of effective herbal antidiabetic medicines in near future.
Plant growth and development can be adversely affected by cold stress, limiting productivity. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) family comprises important detoxifying enzymes, which play major roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses by reducing the oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species. Pumpkins (Cucurbitamaxima) are widely grown, economically important, and nutritious; however, their yield can be severely affected by cold stress. The identification of putative candidate genes responsible for cold-stress tolerance, including the GST family genes, is therefore vital. For the first time, we identified 32 C. maxima GST (CmaGST) genes using a combination of bioinformatics approaches and characterized them by expression profiling. These CmaGST genes represent seven of the 14 known classes of plant GSTs, with 18 CmaGSTs categorized into the tau class. The CmaGSTs were distributed across 13 of pumpkin's 20 chromosomes, with the highest numbers found on chromosomes 4 and 6. The large number of CmaGST genes resulted from gene duplication; 11 and 5 pairs of CmaGST genes were segmental- and tandem-duplicated, respectively. In addition, all CmaGST genes showed organ-specific expression. The expression of the putative GST genes in pumpkin was examined under cold stress in two lines with contrasting cold tolerance: cold-tolerant CP-1 (C. maxima) and cold-susceptible EP-1 (Cucurbita moschata). Seven genes (CmaGSTU3, CmaGSTU7, CmaGSTU8, CmaGSTU9, CmaGSTU11, CmaGSTU12, and CmaGSTU14) were highly expressed in the cold-tolerant line and are putative candidates for use in breeding cold-tolerant crop varieties. These results increase our understanding of the cold-stress-related functions of the GST family, as well as potentially enhancing pumpkin breeding programs.
Large numbers of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are required for making stable cell bank. Although suspension culture yields high cell numbers, there remain unresolved challenges for obtaining high-density of hiPSCs because large size aggregates exhibit low growth rates. Here, we established a simple method for hiPSC aggregate break-up using botulinum hemagglutinin (HA), which specifically bound with E-cadherin and disrupted cell-cell connections in hiPSC aggregates. HA showed temporary activity for disrupting the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell connections to facilitate the break-up of aggregates into small sizes only 9 hr after HA addition. The transportation of HA into the aggregates was mediated by transcellular and paracellular way after HA addition to the culture medium. hiPSC aggregates broken up by HA showed a higher number of live cells, higher cell density, and higher expansion fold compared to those of aggregates dissociated with enzymatic digestion. Moreover, a maximum cell density of 4.5 ± 0.2 × 106 cells ml-1 was obtained by aggregate break-up into small ones, which was three times higher than that with the conventional culture without aggregate break-up. Therefore, the temporary activity of HA for disrupting E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell connection was key to establishing a simple in situ method for hiPSC aggregate break-up in bioreactors, leading to high cell density in suspension culture.
This study reports adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) by magnetic manganese ferrite and manganese oxide nano-particles (MnF-MO-NPs) composite from aqueous media. The X-ray diffraction pattern of MnF-MO-NPs revealed a polycrystalline nature with nanoscale crystallite size. The prepared adsorbent with high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area of 100.62 m2/g and saturation magnetization of 30.12 emu/g exhibited maximum Cr(VI) removal at solution pH 2.0 and was easily separated from water under an external magnetic field. Adsorption capacity as much as 91.24 mg/g is reported and electrostatic interaction between positively charged adsorbent surface and anionic metal ion species is the main driving force in this adsorption. Adsorption experimental data followed Langmuir isotherm and second order kinetics. Partial involvement of intra-particle diffusion was also observed due to the mesoporous nature of MnF-MO-NPs. The thermodynamic studies revealed that the process was favorable, spontaneous and exothermic in nature. An artificial neural network model was developed for accurate prediction of Cr(VI) ions removal with minimum mean squared error (MSE) of 15.4 × 10-4 and maximum R2 of 0.98. Owing to large surface to volume ratio, advantage of easy magnetic separation, and high adsorption capacity towards Cr(VI), the reported MnF-MO-NPs appear to be a potential candidate in Cr(VI) contaminated wastewater remediation.
Lifelong oral anticoagulation, either with warfarin or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), is indicated for stroke prevention in most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Emerging evidence suggests that NOACs may be associated with better renal outcomes than warfarin.
This study aimed to compare 4 oral anticoagulant agents (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin) for their effects on 4 renal outcomes: ≥30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), doubling of the serum creatinine level, acute kidney injury (AKI), and kidney failure.
Using a large U.S. administrative database linked to laboratory results, the authors identified 9,769 patients with nonvalvular AF who started taking an oral anticoagulant agent between October 1, 2010 and April 30, 2016. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance more than 60 baseline characteristics among patients in the 4 drug cohorts. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed in the weighted population to compare oral anticoagulant agents.
The cumulative risk at the end of 2 years for each outcome was 24.4%, 4.0%, 14.8%, and 1.7% for ≥30% decline in eGFR, doubling of serum creatinine, AKI, and kidney failure, respectively. When the 3 NOACs were pooled, they were associated with reduced risks of ≥30% decline in eGFR (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66 to 0.89; p &lt; 0.001), doubling of serum creatinine (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.95; p = 0.03), and AKI (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.81; p &lt; 0.001) compared with warfarin. When comparing each NOAC with warfarin, dabigatran was associated with lower risks of ≥30% decline in eGFR and AKI; rivaroxaban was associated with lower risks of ≥30% decline in eGFR, doubling of serum creatinine, and AKI; however, apixaban did not have a statistically significant relationship with any of the renal outcomes.
Renal function decline is common among patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulant agents. NOACs, particularly dabigatran and rivaroxaban, may be associated with lower risks of adverse renal outcomes than warfarin.
Special attention is required in planning and administering radiation therapy to patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), such as pacemaker and defibrillator. The range of dose to CIEDs that can induce malfunction is large among CIEDs. Clinically significant defects have been reported at dose as low as 0.15 Gy. Therefore, accurate estimation of dose to CIED and dose reduction are both important even if the dose is expected to be less than the often-used 2-Gy limit. We investigated the use of bolus in in vivo dosimetry for CIEDs. Solid water phantom measurements of out-of-field dose for a 6-MV beam were performed using parallel plate chamber with and without 1- to 2-cm bolus covering the chamber. In vivo dosimetry at skin surface above the CIED was performed with and without bolus covering the CIED for three patients with the CIED &lt;5 cm from the field edge. Chamber measured dose at depth ~0.5-1.5 cm below the skin surface, where the CIED is normally located, was reduced by ~7-48% with bolus. The dose reduction became smaller at deeper depths and with smaller field size. In vivo dosimetry at skin surface also indicated ~20%-60% lower dose when using bolus for the three patients. The dose measured with bolus more accurately reflects the dose to CIED and is less affected by contaminant electrons and linac head scatter. In general, the treatment planning system (TPS) calculation underestimated the dose to CIED, but it predicts the CIED dose more accurately when bolus is used. We recommend the use of 1- to 2-cm bolus to cover the CIED during in vivo CIED dose measurements for more accurate CIED dose estimation. If the CIED is placed &lt;2 cm in depth and its dose is mainly from anterior beams, we recommend using the bolus during the entire course of radiation delivery to reduce the dose to CIED.
Secondary batteries based on earth-abundant sodium metal anodes are desirable for both stationary and portable electrical energy storage. Room-temperature sodium metal batteries are impractical today because morphological instability during recharge drives rough, dendritic electrodeposition. Chemical instability of liquid electrolytes also leads to premature cell failure as a result of parasitic reactions with the anode. Here we use joint density-functional theoretical analysis to show that the surface diffusion barrier for sodium ion transport is a sensitive function of the chemistry of solid-electrolyte interphase. In particular, we find that a sodium bromide interphase presents an exceptionally low energy barrier to ion transport, comparable to that of metallic magnesium. We evaluate this prediction by means of electrochemical measurements and direct visualization studies. These experiments reveal an approximately three-fold reduction in activation energy for ion transport at a sodium bromide interphase. Direct visualization of sodium electrodeposition confirms large improvements in stability of sodium deposition at sodium bromide-rich interphases.The chemistry at the interface between electrolyte and electrode plays a critical role in determining battery performance. Here, the authors show that a NaBr enriched solid-electrolyte interphase can lower the surface diffusion barrier for sodium ions, enabling stable electrodeposition.
Up to 90% of patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome require red blood cell transfusion; nevertheless, comprehensive data on red cell alloimmunization in such patients are limited. This study evaluates the incidence and clinical impact of red cell alloimmunization in a large cohort of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome registered in the statewide South Australian-MDS registry. The median age of the 817 patients studied was 73 years, and 66% were male. The cumulative incidence of alloimmunization was 11%. Disease-modifying therapy was associated with a lower risk of alloimmunization while alloimmunization was significantly higher in patients with a revised International Prognostic Scoring System classification of Very Low, Low or Intermediate risk compared to those with a High or Very High risk (P=0.03). Alloantibodies were most commonly directed against antigens in the Rh (54%) and Kell (24%) systems. Multiple alloantibodies were present in 49% of alloimmunized patients. Although 73% of alloimmunized patients developed alloantibodies during the period in which they received their first 20 red cell units, the total number of units transfused was significantly higher in alloimmunized patients than in non-alloimmunized patients (90±100 versus 30±52; P&lt;0.0001). In individual patients, red cell transfusion intensity increased significantly following alloimmunization (2.8±1.3 versus 4.1±2.0; P&lt;0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of alloimmunized patients than non-alloimmunized patients had detectable autoantibodies (65% versus 18%; P&lt;0.0001) and the majority of autoantibodies were detected within a short period of alloimmunization. In conclusion, this study characterizes alloimmunization in a large cohort of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and demonstrates a signficant increase in red cell transfusion requirements following alloimmunization, most probably due to development of additional alloantibodies and autoantibodies, resulting in subclinical/clinical hemolysis. Strategies to mitigate alloimmunization risk are critical for optimizing red cell transfusion support.
The anatomical, electrical, and clinical impact of incomplete Lariat left atrial appendage ligation remains unclear.
We studied LAA anatomy pre- and postligation using contrast enhanced-computed tomography (CT) scans in 91 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who subsequently underwent catheter ablation (CA).
Eleven patients had an incomplete exclusion (12%) with a central leak ranging from 1 to 5 mm. Despite incomplete ligation; the LAA volume were reduced by 67% postprocedurally when compared to preprocedure. In 7 patients with a leak between 1 and 3 mm, there was a 77% reduction in LAA volume beyond the ligation site suggestive of remodeling of the LAA. In 4 patients with larger (4-5 mm) leak the LAA remnants (LAARs) were slightly larger than those with smaller leaks on follow-up CT scan. Three out of the 4 demonstrated LAA electrical activity during CA and underwent isolation of the LAA ostium. Follow-up imaging showed two of these LAARs completely sealed with no communication with the left atrium. There was no significant difference in the AF recurrence rates between the patients who had a leak versus those with complete ligation (4 of 11 [36%] vs. 22 of 80 [27%]; P  =  0.6). Oral anticoagulation was discontinued in all patients with small leaks and 2 patients with large leaks that sealed completely upon follow-up imaging. There were no strokes or TIAs at 12 months.
Despite incomplete LAA ligation by Lariat device there is significant anatomical and electrical remodeling that resulted in reduction in LAA size, volume, and electrical activity.
Atmospheric pollution, one of the leading environmental problems in South and East Asia, and its impact on the terrestrial environmental quality remain poorly understood particularly in alpine areas where both historical and present-day mining and smelting operations might leave an imprint. Here, we reconstructed atmospheric trace metals pollution during the past century using core sediments from a large and deep alpine lake in Southwest China. The implication of in lake and/or in watershed sediment focusing in pollution quantification is discussed by analyzing 15 sediment cores. Factor analysis and enrichment factor indicated Cd, Pb and Sb as the typical pollutants. Distinct peaks of Pb and Sb pollution were observed around the 1920s, but little Pb pollution was detected in recent decades, different from other studies in similar regions. Cadmium pollution was observed until the mid-1980s synchronized with Sb. The distinctive variations in atmospheric trace metal pollution process in Southwest China highlight the regional and sub-regional sources of metal pollutants, which should be primarily attributed to non-ferrous metal smelting emissions. Both natural and anthropogenic metals showed wide concentration ranges though exhibited similar temporal trends in the 15 cores. Spatial variations of anthropogenic metals were influenced by the in-watershed pollutants remobilization, whereas, natural metals were regulated by the detrital materials in the sub-basin. In-lake sediment focusing had little influence on the spatial distributions of all metals, different from the traditional sediment focusing pattern observed in small lakes. Anthropogenic Cd accumulation in sediments ranged from 1.5 to 10.1mgm-2 in a specific core with an average of 6.5mgm-2 for the entire lake, highlighting that a reliable whole-lake pollutant budget requires an analysis of multiple cores. Our study suggests that the management of aquatic ecosystem health should take the remobilization of in-watershed stored pollutants into consideration especially under increasing human perturbation.
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease. It is a global public health concern since it causes an acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). A large number of JE/AES cases are reported to occur in areas with established or developing JE vaccination program. Partial vaccine coverage and emergence of new variants of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) might be playing an important role. The envelope protein (E) of JEV is a major antigenic determinant and responsible for immunogenic responses as well as membrane fusion and virion assembly. In the present study, we have characterized the JEV live attenuated vaccine strain SA14-14-2 in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21). The vaccine strain showed enhanced replication following its passage in BHK-21 cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the E protein gene of the cell-culture adapted vaccine strain showed an important point mutation. The mutation in the E protein gene was identical to its wild-type parent strain SA14. This study suggests the possibility of reversion mutation and exaltation of vaccine strains following adaptation in the host cells.
Obtaining accurate drug response data in large cohorts of cancer patients is very challenging; thus, most cancer pharmacogenomics discovery is conducted in preclinical studies, typically using cell lines and mouse models. However, these platforms suffer from serious limitations, including small sample sizes. Here, we have developed a novel computational method that allows us to impute drug response in very large clinical cancer genomics data sets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The approach works by creating statistical models relating gene expression to drug response in large panels of cancer cell lines and applying these models to tumor gene expression data in the clinical data sets (e.g., TCGA). This yields an imputed drug response for every drug in each patient. These imputed drug response data are then associated with somatic genetic variants measured in the clinical cohort, such as copy number changes or mutations in protein coding genes. These analyses recapitulated drug associations for known clinically actionable somatic genetic alterations and identified new predictive biomarkers for existing drugs.
Large insert mate pair reads have been used in de novo assembly and discovery of structural variants. We developed a new approach, Cre-LoxP inverse PCR paired end (CLIP-PE), which exploits the advantages of (1) Cre-LoxP recombination system to efficiently circularize large DNA fragments, (2) inverse PCR to enrich for the desired products that contain both ends of the large DNA fragments, and (3) use of restriction enzymes to introduce a recognizable junction site between ligated fragment ends. We have successfully created CLIP-PE libraries of up to 22 kb jumping pairs and demonstrated their ability to improve genome assemblies. The CLIP-PE methodology can be implemented with existing and future next-generation sequencing platforms.
Crossing fibers are prevalent in human brains and a subject of intense interest for neuroscience. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve tissue orientation but is blind to crossing fibers. Many advanced diffusion-weighted magnetic resolution imaging (MRI) approaches have been presented to extract crossing-fibers from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), but the relative sensitivity and specificity of approaches remains unclear. Here, we examine two leading approaches (PAS and q-ball) in the context of a large-scale, single subject reproducibility study. A single healthy individual was scanned 11 times with 96 diffusion weighted directions and 10 reference volumes for each of five b-values (1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000 s/mm2) for a total of 5830 volumes (over the course of three sessions). We examined the reproducibility of the number of fibers per voxel, volume fraction, and crossing-fiber angles. For each method, we determined the minimum resolvable angle for each acquisition. Reproducibility of fiber counts per voxel was generally high (~80% consensus for PAS and ~70% for q-ball), but there was substantial bias between individual repetitions and model estimated with all data (~10% lower consensus for PAS and ~15% lower for q-ball). Both PAS and q-ball predominantly discovered fibers crossing at near 90 degrees, but reproducibility was higher for PAS across most measures. Within voxels with low anisotropy, q-ball finds more intra-voxel structure; meanwhile, PAS resolves multiple fibers at greater than 75 degrees for more voxels. These results can inform researchers when deciding between HARDI approaches or interpreting findings across studies.
In India, the prevention of parent-to-child transmission and antiretroviral therapy services for HIV-infected mothers and children have been rapidly scaled up over the recent years. Despite these advances, a large number of HIV-infected children are born in every year. A thorough literature review has been done by retrieving related studies (published from the year 2000 onward); using a Medline search and by extracting recent findings from the official websites of the National AIDS Control Organization, UNAIDS, UNICEF, and World Health Organization. The efforts that are made to control pediatric HIV are challenged by a large range of factors such as low health service utilization, poor drug adherence, delayed infant diagnosis, discriminatory attitude of health providers, loss to follow-up, and poor coordination in managing continuum of care. These challenges may be addressed by adopting innovative and effective strategies and strengthening the existing health system. This would bring about a significant reduction in pediatric HIV incidence and improve the outcomes in children who are HIV infected.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with marked gender and ethnic disparities. We report a large transancestral association study of SLE using Immunochip genotype data from 27,574 individuals of European (EA), African (AA) and Hispanic Amerindian (HA) ancestry. We identify 58 distinct non-HLA regions in EA, 9 in AA and 16 in HA (∼50% of these regions have multiple independent associations); these include 24 novel SLE regions (P&lt;5 × 10-8), refined association signals in established regions, extended associations to additional ancestries, and a disentangled complex HLA multigenic effect. The risk allele count (genetic load) exhibits an accelerating pattern of SLE risk, leading us to posit a cumulative hit hypothesis for autoimmune disease. Comparing results across the three ancestries identifies both ancestry-dependent and ancestry-independent contributions to SLE risk. Our results are consistent with the unique and complex histories of the populations sampled, and collectively help clarify the genetic architecture and ethnic disparities in SLE.
Incidental observation of extra-striatal uptake of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 has been reported previously in multiple space-occupying lesions of the brain. We present here a SPECT/CT scan of a 60-year old female with parkinsonism, with normal presynaptic dopaminergic transporters expression and with an intense tracer uptake in a large right-sided frontoparietal meningioma.
We report a new strategy for ligand-free attachment of plasmonic Au nanoparticles on the surface of a ZnO nanowire to make high-performance broadband photodetectors using a pulsed laser ablation technique in a liquid medium. The photoresponse of the ZnO-based photodetector is enhanced and the photodetection limit is broadened from UV to visible, which can be controlled by varying the concentration of Au nanoparticles attached to the ZnO surface. This Au nanoparticle concentration can be tuned by varying the number of laser pulses used in the ablation process. We found that the responsivity of the detector is 10 mA W-1 for [Formula: see text] and increases to as much as 0.4 A W-1 for λ ≤ 400 nm for the maximum Au concentration. The enhanced responsivity was found to be linked to increased absorption over a broad spectral range arising from direct and indirect plasmonic processes due to Au nanoparticle attachment, and the enhanced absorption also leads to a large increment in photocurrent generation. We also found that the attachment of Au nanoparticles makes the relaxation of the photocurrent (persistence) considerably faster in both the UV and visible regions of the spectrum and that the persistence directly depends on the concentration of Au nanoparticles attached to the ZnO nanowire. This single-step pulsed laser ablation-based nanoparticle attachment process can be further used to make other plasmonic nanoparticle-decorated nanowire devices.
Aggregate culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is a promising method to obtain high number of cells for cell therapy applications. This study quantitatively evaluated the effects of initial cell number and culture time on the growth of hiPSCs in the culture of single aggregate. Small size aggregates ((1.1 ± 0.4) × 101-(2.8 ± 0.5) × 101 cells/aggregate) showed a lower growth rate in comparison to medium size aggregates ((8.8 ± 0.8) × 101-(6.8 ± 1.1) × 102 cells/aggregate) during early-stage of culture (24-72 h). However, when small size aggregates were cultured in conditioned medium, their growth rate increased significantly. On the other hand, large size aggregates ((1.1 ± 0.2) × 103-(3.5 ± 1.1) × 103 cells/aggregate) showed a lower growth rate and lower expression level of proliferation marker (ki-67) in the center region of aggregate in comparison to medium size aggregate during early-stage of culture. Medium size aggregates showed the highest growth rate during early-stage of culture. Furthermore, hiPSCs proliferation was dependent on culture time because the growth rate decreased significantly during late-stage of culture (72-120 h) at which point collagen type I accumulated on the periphery of aggregate, suggesting blockage of diffusive transport of nutrients, oxygen and metabolites into and out of the aggregates. Consideration of initial cell number and culture time are important to maintain balance between autocrine factors secretion and extracellular matrix accumulation on the aggregate periphery to achieve optimal growth of hiPSCs in the culture of single aggregate.
Utilization of different types of solid wastes through composting is important for environmental sustainability and restoring soil quality. Although drum composting is an efficient technology, the possibility of heavy metal contamination restricts its large-scale use. In this research, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of water hyacinth drum compost (DC) and traditional vermicompost (VC) on soil quality and crop growth in an agro-ecosystem cultivated intensively with tomato and cabbage as test crops. A substantial improvement in soil health was observed with respect to nutrient availability, physical stability, and microbial diversity due to the application of drum compost and traditional vermicompost. Moreover, soil organic carbon was enriched through increased humic and fulvic acid carbon. Interestingly, heavy metal contamination was less significant in vermicompost-treated soils than in those receiving the other treatments. The use of VC and DC in combination with recommended chemical fertilization effectively stimulated crop growth, yield, product quality, and storage longevity for both tomato and cabbage.
We present the synthesis and a detailed investigation of structural and magnetic properties of metal-organic compound Cu2(IPA)2(DMF)(H2O) by means of x-ray diffraction, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements. Single crystals of the title compound were synthesized by judicious selection of organic ligand and employing a selective hydrothermal reaction route. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with space group Cmca. The structural analysis revealed that two Cu2+ ions are held together by the organic component (-O-C-O-) in a square paddle-wheel to form spin dimers which are aligned perpendicular to each other and are further coupled through organic ligands (isophthalic acid) forming two-dimensional layers. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility [Formula: see text] could be described well using spin-1/2 dimer model. The spin susceptibility [Formula: see text] shows an exponential decrease in the low temperature region, below the broad maximum, confirming the singlet ground state with a large spin gap of [Formula: see text] K. The heat capacity C p measured as a function of temperature also confirms the absence of magnetic long-range-order down to 2 K.
Experimental studies suggest that mechanical cell washing to remove pro-inflammatory components that accumulate in the supernatant of stored donor red blood cells (RBCs) might reduce inflammation and organ injury in transfused patients.
Cardiac surgery patients at increased risk of large-volume RBC transfusion were eligible. Participants were randomized to receive either mechanically washed allogenic RBCs or standard care RBCs. The primary outcome was serum interleukin-8 measured at baseline and at four postsurgery time points. A mechanism substudy evaluated the effects of washing on stored RBCs in vitro and on markers of platelet, leucocyte, and endothelial activation in trial subjects.
Sixty adult cardiac surgery patients at three UK cardiac centres were enrolled between September 2013 and March 2015. Subjects received a median of 3.5 (interquartile range 2-5.5) RBC units, stored for a mean of 21 ( sd 5.2) days, within 48 h of surgery. Mechanical washing reduced concentrations of RBC-derived microvesicles but increased cell-free haemoglobin concentrations in RBC supernatant relative to standard care RBC supernatant. There was no difference between groups with respect to perioperative serum interleukin-8 values [adjusted mean difference 0.239 (95% confidence intervals -0.231, 0.709), P =0.318] or concentrations of plasma RBC microvesicles, platelet and leucocyte activation, plasma cell-free haemoglobin, endothelial activation, or biomarkers of heart, lung, or kidney injury.
These results do not support a hypothesis that allogenic red blood cell washing has clinical benefits in cardiac surgery.

We present the synthesis and a detailed investigation of structural and magnetic properties of metal-organic compound Cu$_2$(IPA)$_2$(DMF)(H$_2$O) by means of x-ray diffraction, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements. Single crystals of the title compound were synthesized by judicious selection of organic ligand and employing a selective hydrothermal reaction route. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with space group $Cmca$. The structural analysis revealed that two Cu$^{2+}$ ions are held together by the organic component (-O-C-O-) in a square paddle-wheel to form spin dimers which are aligned perpendicular to each other and are further coupled through organic ligands (isophthalic acid) forming two-dimensional layers. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ could be described well using spin-$1/2$ dimer model. The spin susceptibility $\chi_{\rm spin} (T)$ shows an exponential decrease in the low temperature region, below the broad maximum, confirming the singlet ground state with a large spin gap of $\Delta/k_{\rm B} \simeq 409$~K. The heat capacity $C_{\rm p}$ measured as a function of temperature also confirms the absence of magnetic long-range-order down to 2~K.
  Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a major signal molecules and modulate physiology of mammalian oocytes. Ovarian follicles generate large amount of NO through nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway to maintain diplotene arrest in preovulatory oocytes. Removal of oocytes from follicular microenvironment or follicular rupture during ovulation disrupt the flow of NO from granulosa cells to the oocyte that results a transient decrease of oocyte cytoplasmic NO level. Decreased NO level reduces cyclic nucleotides level by inactivating guanylyl cyclases directly or indirectly. The reduced cyclic nucleotides level modulate specific phosphorylation status of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and triggers cyclin B1 degradation. These changes result in maturation promoting factor (MPF) destabilization that finally triggers meiotic resumption from diplotene as well as metaphase-II (M-II) arrest in most of the mammalian species.
We describe a phase transition that gives rise to structurally non-trivial states in a two-dimensional ordered network of particles connected by harmonic bonds. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the network supports, apart from the homogeneous phase, a number of heterogeneous "pleated" phases, which can be stabilised by an external field. This field is conjugate to a global collective variable quantifying "non-affineness," i.e., the deviation of local particle displacements from local affine deformation. In the pleated phase, stress is localised in ordered rows of pleats and eliminated from the rest of the lattice. The kinetics of the phase transition is unobservably slow in molecular dynamics simulation near coexistence, due to very large free energy barriers. When the external field is increased further to lower these barriers, the network exhibits rich dynamic behaviour: it transforms into a metastable phase with the stress now localised in a disordered arrangement of pleats. The pattern of pleats shows ageing dynamics and slow relaxation to equilibrium. Our predictions may be checked by experiments on tethered colloidal solids in dynamic laser traps.
The heritability of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cannot be fully explained by recognized genetic risk factors identified as achieving genome-wide significance. In addition, the combined contribution of genetic variation to COPD risk has not been fully explored. We sought to determine: (1) whether studies of variants from previous studies of COPD or lung function in a larger sample could identify additional associated variants, particularly for severe COPD; and (2) the impact of genetic risk scores on COPD. We genotyped 3,346 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,588 cases (1,803 severe COPD) and 1,782 control subjects from four cohorts, and performed association testing with COPD, combining these results with existing genotyping data from 6,633 cases (3,497 severe COPD) and 5,704 control subjects. In addition, we developed genetic risk scores from SNPs associated with lung function and COPD and tested their discriminatory power for COPD-related measures. We identified significant associations between SNPs near PPIC (P = 1.28 × 10-8) and PPP4R4/SERPINA1 (P = 1.01 × 10-8) and severe COPD; the latter association may be driven by recognized variants in SERPINA1. Genetic risk scores based on SNPs previously associated with COPD and lung function had a modest ability to discriminate COPD (area under the curve, ∼0.6), and accounted for a mean 0.9-1.9% lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted for each additional risk allele. In a large genetic association analysis, we identified associations with severe COPD near PPIC and SERPINA1. A risk score based on combining genetic variants had modest, but significant, effects on risk of COPD and lung function.
The summer surface air temperature (SAT) in the Humid Subtropical Climate Zone in India, exhibits a significant cooling trend (~-3 °C/40 yrs.) in CRU observational data during 1961-2000. Here we investigate the contribution of internal and external factors, which are driving this cooling trend. Using the Community Earth System Model-Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), we analyze the historical climate change in presence of internal climate variability. Most of the model ensemble members could reproduce this amplified cooling (&lt;-3 °C) as shown from CRU data. Further analyses reveals that external forcing displays a strong cooling effect over this region, while internal variability displays mixed cooling (in most cases) and warming signals. The signal to noise ratio i.e. the ratio of external forcings and internal climatic variability is less than 1, which indicates that internal climatic variability dominates over the forced response. Furthermore, to quantify the role of different external forcing factors we used the CCSM4 single forcing simulations. The simulation results from CESM-LE and CCSM4 suggest that the cooling trend over the region is primarily due to the combined influence of internal variability (~73%) and partly due to aerosol (~10%) and ozone only forcing, which strongly mask the warming effect of GHG and solar forcing.
Nephron endowment in renal transplantation is infrequently considered, but may have important implications for post kidney transplantation outcomes. In this population-cohort study, we analyzed the deceased-donor kidney transplant outcomes stratified by donor-to-recipient size ratios.
Data for all deceased-donor adult kidney transplantation recipients between 2003 and 2015 were extracted from the UK Transplant Registry. We used weight as a surrogate marker for kidney size and defined the following mismatch categories (donor weight/recipient weight × 100): less than 75% (small donor kidney), 75% to 125% (weight matched kidney), and greater than 125% (large donor kidney). Univariable and multivariable analyses were undertaken to assess the relationship between this marker and patient outcomes.
Outcomes for 11 720 transplants were analyzed with weight mismatch stratified as follows; small donor kidney (n = 1608, 13.7%), weight matched kidney (n = 7247, 61.8%) and large donor kidney (n = 2865, 24.4%). On multivariable analysis, no significant differences were detected in overall (P = 0.876) or death-censored (P = 0.173) graft survival, or in rates of delayed graft function (P = 0.396) between these 3 groups. However, 12-month creatinine levels were found to decline progressively across the groups (P &lt; 0.001), with adjusted averages of 144.2 μmol/L for recipients of small donor kidneys, 134.7 μmol/L in weight matched kidneys, and 124.9 μmol/L in recipients of large donor kidneys. In addition, patient survival was found to be significantly shorter in recipients of larger kidneys than those with weight matched kidneys (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.40; P = 0.009), which is inconsistent with the existing literature.
Our data demonstrate that 12-month creatinine is influenced by donor-to-recipient difference in body weight, but that no such difference is observed for either delayed graft function or death-censored graft survival. However, we observed increased mortality in recipients receiving larger kidneys; an observation which conflicts with the existing literature and warrants further investigation.
 During primary teething, children suffer from running nose, mild fever, diarrhoea and other mild irritations and inflammations. A public health programme, 'Homoeopathy for the Healthy Child', was undertaken on a pilot basis focusing on promotion of healthy teething by provision of home-based care through six pre-identified homeopathic medicines for complaints commonly observed during primary teething. This article assesses the feasibility of this programme and reports the impact of this initiative on teething profile in children and episodes of diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).
 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) were trained in child care and usage of a kit comprising six medicines, namely Calcarea phosphoricum 6X (CP), Ferrum phosphoricum 3X, Magnesium phosphoricum 6X, Belladonna 30C, Chamomilla 30C and Podophyllum 30C. Calcarea phosphoricum was given regularly to each participating child from 6 months to 1 year of age. Home-based care for diarrhoea, URTI and mild fever was provided by ASHAs using the other five medicines in the kit. Dentition pattern and diarrhoea/URTI episodes were recorded over a period of the next 12 months.
 Eleven thousand four-hundred and twenty-six children were followed up regularly. Amongst those who enrolled at 6-7 months, a larger proportion of children were approaching expected teething in successive months as compared with children enrolled at 12 months, thus indicating that teething delays, if any, were overcome during this period. Incidence of diarrhoea and URTI showed decrease in the months after enrolment. Children responded favourably to the medicines given by ASHAs at the time of diarrhoea/URTI episodes, and ASHAs expressed satisfaction with the programme.
 An approach with regular use of CP and home-based care with homeopathy through health workers for common problems in teething children is acceptable to the community and enhances outreach of services to the public at large. Observations in terms of the healthy teething period may be further validated through studies of homeopathy with suitable comparator group.
Fructokinase (FRK) catalyzes the first step of fructose metabolism i.e., D-fructose to D-fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), however, the mechanistic insights of this reaction are elusive yet. Here we demonstrate that the putative Vibrio cholerae fructokinase (VcFRK) exhibit strong fructose-6-kinase activity allosterically modulated by K+/Cs+. We have determined the crystal structures of apo-VcFRK and its complex with fructose, fructose-ADP-Ca2+, fructose-ADP-Ca2+-BeF3-. Collectively, we propose the catalytic mechanism and allosteric activation of VcFRK in atomistic details explaining why K+/Cs+ are better activator than Na+. Structural results suggest that apo VcFRK allows entry of fructose in the active site, sequester it through several conserved H-bonds and attains a closed form through large scale conformational changes. A double mutant (H108C/T261C-VcFRK), that arrests the closed form but unable to reopen for F6P release, is catalytically impotent highlighting the essentiality of this conformational change. Negative charge accumulation around ATP upon fructose binding, is presumed to redirect the γ-phosphate towards fructose for efficient phosphotransfer. Reduced phosphotransfer rate of the mutants E205Q and E110Q supports this view. Atomic resolution structure of VcFRK-fructose-ADP-Ca2+-BeF3-, reported first time for any sugar kinase, suggests that BeF3- moiety alongwith R176, Ca2+ and 'anion hole' limit the conformational space for γ-phosphate favoring in-line phospho-transfer.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundantly found common form of DNA variation in the human genome. Many genetic association studies have proved that some of these SNPs are involved in regulating several cellular/physiological processes ranging from gene regulation to disease development. Analysis of the protein complex that binds to these SNPs is a crucial step in studying the mechanisms by which gene expressions are regulated in cis- or trans-acting manner. Commonly used techniques to determine DNA-protein interaction, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), have limited value for simultaneously analyzing a large number of proteins in the complex. Furthermore, this assay is tedious and time-consuming and often requires radiolabeled probe as well as extensive optimization. Here, we describe a pull-down assay before performing the EMSA, which helps in the detection of differentially-bound protein(s) in an allele-specific manner. The assay is easy to perform and does not require radiolabeling of DNA probes. Biotinylated DNA probe bound to streptavidin beads can be complexed with protein(s) from cell nuclear lysate, nonspecific proteins were washed out, and only protein(s) having high affinity to SNP-specific DNA were detected on SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease, affects a large number of people worldwide, leading to death. Here, we analyzed the compositional features and trends of codon usage of the genes influencing COPD to understand molecular biology, genetics, and evolutionary relationships of these genes as no work was reported yet. Coding sequences of COPD genes were found to be rich in guanine-cytosine (GC) content. A high value (34-60) of the effective number of codons of the genes indicated low codon usage bias (CUB). Correspondence analysis suggested that the COPD genes were distinct in their codon usage patterns. Relative synonymous codon usage values of codons differed between the more preferred codons and the less-preferred ones. Correlation analysis between overall nucleotides and those at third codon position revealed that mutation pressure might influence the CUB of the genes. The high correlation between GC12 and GC3 signified that directional mutation pressure might have operated at all the three codon positions in COPD genes.
Lactose-derived prebiotics provide wide ranges of gastrointestinal comforts. In this review article, the probable biochemical mechanisms through which lactose-derived prebiotics offer positive gastrointestinal health are reported along with the up-to-date results of clinical investigations; this might be the first review article of its kind, to the best of our knowledge. Lactose-derived prebiotics have unique biological and functional values, and they are confirmed as 'safe' by the Food and Drug Administration federal agency. Medical practitioners frequently recommend them as therapeutics as a pure form or combined with dairy-based products (yoghurt, milk and infant formulas) or fruit juices. The biological activities of lactose-derived prebiotics are expressed in the presence of gut microflora, mainly probiotics (Lactobacillus spp. in the small intestine and Bifidobacterium spp. in the large intestine). Clinical investigations reveal that galacto-oligosaccharide reduces the risks of several types of diarrhea (traveler's diarrhea, osmotic diarrhea and Clostridium difficile associated relapsing diarrhea). Lactulose and lactosucrose prevent inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). Lactulose and lactitol reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, lactulose, galacto-oligosaccharide and lactitol prevent constipation in individuals of all ages. It is expected that the present review article will receive great attention from medical practitioners and food technologists.
The human genome contains a large number of retroviral elements acquired over the process of evolution, some of which are specific to primates. However, as many of these are defective or silenced through epigenetic changes, they were historically considered "junk DNA" and their potential role in human physiology or pathological circumstances have been poorly studied. The most recently acquired, human endogenous retrovirus-K (HERV-K), has multiple copies in the human genome and some of them have complete open reading frames that are transcribed and translated, especially in early embryogenesis. Phylogenetically, HERV-K is considered a supergroup of viruses. One of the subtypes, termed HML-2, seems to be the most active and hence, it is the best studied. Aberrant expression of HML-2 in adult tissues has been associated with certain types of cancer and with neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the discovery of these viruses, their classification, structure, regulation and potential for replication, physiological roles, and their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Finally, it presents different therapeutic approaches being considered to target these viruses.
Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in all animals. In humans, isolation has serious effects on health. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model to study small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. However, longer-term analysis of large groups of flies is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We built a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. Next, based on the automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis, we designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. We observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes occurred mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies. In summary, we describe a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies that we use to unravel the behavioral, molecular and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of intragastrical administration of Glucerabacter canisensis NATH-2371T on glucosylceramide (GluCer) digestion in mice. Although G. canisensis was unable to utilize starch and cellulose, coculture of G. canisensis with mouse fecal bacteria greatly increased GluCer hydrolysis in polysaccharide medium, indicating that G. canisensis grew in competition with other intestinal bacteria. Although most of the administered G. canisensis cells were detected in feces, some cells were present in the colorectum contents, which had GluCer-hydrolyzing activity. These results indicate that G. canisensis can viably transit through the mouse gut. Administration of G. canisensis to mice fed diets supplemented with GluCer or GluCer-containing foods significantly enhanced GluCer hydrolysis. Since G. canisensis did not show acute toxicity, it may be useful as a probiotic to augment GluCer hydrolysis in the large intestine. Abbreviations: GluCer: glucosylceramide; KPi: potassium phosphate buffer; C-M: chloroform-methanol.
Schizophrenia and the affective disorders, here comprising bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, are psychiatric illnesses that lead to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Whilst understanding of their pathobiology remains limited, large case-control studies have recently identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with these disorders. However, discerning the functional effects of these SNPs has been difficult as the associated causal genes are unknown. Here we evaluated whether schizophrenia and affective disorder associated-SNPs are correlated with gene expression within human brain tissue. Specifically, to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), we leveraged disorder-associated SNPs identified from 11 genome-wide association studies with gene expression levels in post-mortem, neurologically-normal tissue from two independent human brain tissue expression datasets (UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)). Utilizing stringent multi-region meta-analyses, we identified 2,224 cis-eQTLs associated with expression of 40 genes, including 11 non-coding RNAs. One cis-eQTL, rs16969968, results in a functionally disruptive missense mutation in CHRNA5, a schizophrenia-implicated gene. Importantly, comparing across tissues, we find that blood eQTLs capture &lt; 10% of brain cis-eQTLs. Contrastingly, &gt; 30% of brain-associated eQTLs are significant in tibial nerve. This study identifies putatively causal genes whose expression in region-specific tissue may contribute to the risk of schizophrenia and affective disorders.
Eye plaque brachytherapy is the most common approach for intraocular cancer treatment. It is, however, invasive and subject to large setup uncertainty due to the surgical operation. We propose a novel-focused kV x-ray technique with potential nanoparticle (NP) enhancement and evaluate its application in treating choroidal melanoma and iris melanoma by Monte Carlo (MC) dosimetry modeling.
A polycapillary x-ray lens was used to focus 45 kVp x rays to achieve pinpoint accuracy of dose delivery to small tumors near critical structures. In addition to allowing for beam focusing, the use of kV x rays takes advantage of the strong photoelectric absorption of metallic NPs in that energy regime and hence strong radiosensitization. We constructed an MC simulation program that takes into account the x-ray optic modeling and used GEANT4 for dosimetric calculation. Extensive phantom measurements using a prototype-focused x-ray system were carried out. The MC simulation of simple geometry phantom irradiation was first compared to measurements to verify the x-ray optic lens modeling in conjunction with the Geant4 dosimetric calculation. To simulate tumor treatment, a geometric eye model and two tumor models were constructed. Dose distributions of the simulated treatments were then calculated. NP radiosensitization was also simulated for two concentrations of 2 nm gold NP (AuNP) uniformly distributed in the tumor.
The MC-simulated full width at half maximum (FWHM) and central-axis depth dose of the focused kV x-ray beam match those measured on EBT3 films within ~10% around the depth of focus of the beam. Dose distributions of the simulated ocular tumor treatments show that focused x-ray beams can concentrate the high-dose region in or close to the tumor plus margin. For the simulated posterior choroidal tumor treatment, with sufficient tumor coverage, the doses to the optic disc and fovea are substantially reduced with focused x-ray therapy compared to eye plaque treatment (3.8 vs 39.8 Gy and 11.1 vs 53.8 Gy, respectively). The eye plaque treatment was calculated using an Eye Physics plaque with I-125 seeds under TG43 assumption. For the energy spectrum used in this study, the average simulated dose enhancement ratios (DERs) are roughly 2.1 and 1.1 for 1.0% and 0.1% AuNP mass concentration in the tumor, respectively.
Compared to eye plaque brachytherapy, the proposed focused kV x-ray technique is noninvasive and shows great advantage in sparing healthy critical organs without sacrificing the tumor control. The NP radiation dose enhancement is considerable at our proposed kV range even with a low NP concentration in the tumor, providing better critical structure protection and more flexibility for treatment planning.
The present study focuses on the cross-stream migration of a neutrally buoyant two-dimensional drop in a Poiseuille flow in a channel under the influence of an electric field. In the absence of an electric field, the important nondimensional parameters describing this problem are the viscosity ratio (λ) between the drop fluid and the surrounding medium, the ratio of drop diameter to channel height (a^{*}), and the capillary number (Ca). The influence of all these parameters on drop migration is investigated. It is observed that a large drop moves slowly as compared to a smaller drop, but attains a steady shape at the center line of the channel. The increase in value of the capillary number enhances the cross-stream migration rate, while the increase in viscosity ratio reduces the tendency of the drops to move towards the channel center line. The presence of an electric field introduces additional interfacial stresses at the drop interface, which in turn alters the dynamics observed in the absence of an electric field. Extensive computations are carried out to analyze the combined effect of the electric field and the shear flow on the cross-stream migration of the drop. The computational results for a perfect dielectric indicate that the droplet migration enhances in the presence of an electric field. The permittivity ratio (S) and the electric field strength (E) play major roles in drop migration and deformation. Computations using the leaky dielectric model also show that for certain combinations of electrical properties the drop undergoes immense elongation along the direction of the electric field. The conductivity ratio (R) is again a vital parameter in such a system of fluids. It is further observed that for certain conditions the leaky dielectric drops exhibit rotation together with translation.
Posterior tracheopexy directly addresses membranous tracheal intrusion in severe tracheomalacia (TM). We have previously reported our experience of posterior tracheopexy through open approach in a large series of patients. This study aimed to review lessons learned from our initial series posterior tracheopexy through the video-assisted or robotic video-assisted thoracoscopic approach.
We retrospectively reviewed our single-institution experience on all patients who underwent video-assisted or robotic video-assisted posterior tracheopexy for treatment of symptomatic TM between October 2016 and February 2018.
Ten patients underwent video-assisted (n = 4) or robotic video-assisted (n = 6) thoracoscopic posterior tracheopexy (age range: 8 months-19 years). One patient, the youngest in our cohort, had a type C esophageal atresia repair; none of the other patients had undergone prior thoracic operations. All had symptomatic TM; 1 patient with tracheostomy dependence also had severe distal bronchomalacia, including segmental airways. Postoperatively, patients were hospitalized 3-7 days, with 1-2 days for ICU observation. Improved respiratory symptoms were noted in 9/10 patients following the operation. The 1 patient with preexisting tracheostomy had reduced ventilator dependence but remained hospitalized with ongoing respiratory symptoms.
The thoracoscopic approach for posterior tracheopexy, while challenging, can be applied to a select cohort of children with severe TM. Thoracoscopic surgery with robotic assistance can eliminate some technical limitations of the video-assisted approach by providing an easier platform for more complicated suturing angles.
Cyanide is a potent toxic agent, and the few available antidotes are not amenable to rapid deployment in mass exposures. As a result, there are ongoing efforts to exploit different animal models to identify novel countermeasures. We have created a pipeline that combines high-throughput screening in zebrafish with subsequent validation in two mammalian small animal models as well as a porcine large animal model. We found that zebrafish embryos in the first 3 days post fertilization (dpf) are highly resistant to cyanide, becoming progressively more sensitive thereafter. Unbiased analysis of gene expression in response to several hours of ultimately lethal doses of cyanide in both 1 and 7 dpf zebrafish revealed modest changes in iron-related proteins associated with the age-dependent cyanide resistance. Metabolomics measurements demonstrated significant age-dependent differences in energy metabolism during cyanide exposure which prompted us to test modulators of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and related metabolic processes as potential antidotes. In cyanide-sensitive 7 dpf larvae, we identified several such compounds that offer significant protection against cyanide toxicity. Modulators of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, as well as the small molecule sodium glyoxylate, consistently protected against cyanide toxicity in 7 dpf zebrafish larvae. Together, our results indicate that the resistance of zebrafish embryos to cyanide toxicity during early development is related to an altered regulation of cellular metabolism, which we propose may be exploited as a potential target for the development of novel antidotes against cyanide poisoning.
High-throughput, large-scale medical image computing demands tight integration of high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure for data storage, job distribution, and image processing. The Vanderbilt University Institute for Imaging Science (VUIIS) Center for Computational Imaging (CCI) has constructed a large-scale image storage and processing infrastructure that is composed of (1) a large-scale image database using the eXtensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT), (2) a content-aware job scheduling platform using the Distributed Automation for XNAT pipeline automation tool (DAX), and (3) a wide variety of encapsulated image processing pipelines called "spiders." The VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure have housed and processed nearly half-million medical image volumes with Vanderbilt Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education (ACCRE), which is the HPC facility at the Vanderbilt University. The initial deployment was natively deployed (i.e., direct installations on a bare-metal server) within the ACCRE hardware and software environments, which lead to issues of portability and sustainability. First, it could be laborious to deploy the entire VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure to another HPC center with varying hardware infrastructure, library availability, and software permission policies. Second, the spiders were not developed in an isolated manner, which has led to software dependency issues during system upgrades or remote software installation. To address such issues, herein, we describe recent innovations using containerization techniques with XNAT/DAX which are used to isolate the VUIIS CCI medical image data storage and processing infrastructure from the underlying hardware and software environments. The newly presented XNAT/DAX solution has the following new features: (1) multi-level portability from system level to the application level, (2) flexible and dynamic software development and expansion, and (3) scalable spider deployment compatible with HPC clusters and local workstations.
The "4 per Thousand" initiative was launched at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) in December 2015 to address global climate change through the aspirational goal of increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stock of the world to 40-cm depth by an average annual rate of 4%. Small landholders (SLHs), often faced with difficult bio-physical and socio-economic conditions, are the principal managers of soil in India. There are 117 million SLHs representing 85% of the total operational holdings, cultivating over 72 million ha of land, and meeting 50-60% of India's food requirement. The agricultural soils of SLHs are strongly depleted of SOC and nutrient reserves. Therefore, the challenge of feeding 1.7 billion people in India by 2050 will depend on increasing the current productivity levels by restoring the depleted soils of SLHs. According to our estimates, soils of SLHs currently contain 1370-1770 Tg C and, which can be increased to 2460-2650 Tg C by 2050 through large-scale adoption of best management practices (BMPs) including balanced application of nutrients, compost, agroforestry, and conservation agriculture. A wide spread adoption of these practices can enhance C sequestration by 70-130 Tg CO2e per annum and produce 410-440 million Mg of food grains accounting for 80-85% of the total requirement by 2050. In this paper we propose strategies for achieving the dual objectives of advancing food security, the "4 per Thousand" target and mitigating climate change in India.
Plant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) vary in sequence structure. We assembled the Brassica oleracea var. capitata mtDNA using a mean coverage depth of 25X whole genome sequencing (WGS) and confirmed the presence of eight contigs/fragments by BLASTZ using the previously reported KJ820683 and AP012988 mtDNA as reference. Assembly of the mtDNA sequence reads resulted in a circular structure of 219,975 bp. Our assembled mtDNA, NCBI acc. no. KU831325, contained 34 protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA genes, and 19 tRNA genes with similarity to the KJ820683 and AP012988 reference mtDNA. No large repeats were found in the KU831325 assembly. However, KU831325 showed differences in the arrangement of bases at different regions compared to the previously reported mtDNAs. In the reference mtDNAs KJ820683 and AP012988, contig/fragment number 4 is partitioned into two contigs/fragments, 4a and 4b. However, contig/fragment number 4 was a single contig/fragment with 29,661 bp in KU831325. PCR and qRT-PCR using flanking markers from separate parts of contig/fragment number 4 confirmed it to be a single contig/fragment. In addition, genome re-alignment of the plastid genome and mtDNAs supported the presence of heteroplasmy and reverse arrangement of the heteroplasmic blocks within the other mtDNAs compared to KU831325 that might be one of the causal factors for its diversity. Our results thus confirm the existence of different mtDNAs in diverse B. oleracea subspecies.
The male predominance in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has motivated research on sex differentiation in ASD. Multiple sources of evidence have suggested a neurophenotypic convergence of ASD-related characteristics and typical sex differences. Two existing, albeit competing, models provide predictions on such neurophenotypic convergence. These two models are testable with neuroimaging. Specifically, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) model predicts that ASD is associated with enhanced brain maleness in both males and females with ASD (i.e., a shift-towards-maleness). In contrast, the Gender Incoherence (GI) model predicts a shift-towards-maleness in females, yet a shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD.
To clarify whether either model applies to the intrinsic functional properties of the brain in males with ASD, we measured the statistical overlap between typical sex differences and ASD-related atypicalities in resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) datasets largely available in males. Main analyses focused on two large-scale R-fMRI samples: 357 neurotypical (NT) males and 471 NT females from the 1000 Functional Connectome Project and 360 males with ASD and 403 NT males from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.
Across all R-fMRI metrics, results revealed coexisting, but network-specific, shift-towards-maleness and shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD. A shift-towards-maleness mostly involved the default network, while a shift-towards-femaleness mostly occurred in the somatomotor network. Explorations of the associated cognitive processes using available cognitive ontology maps indicated that higher-order social cognitive functions corresponded to the shift-towards-maleness, while lower-order sensory motor processes corresponded to the shift-towards-femaleness.
The present findings suggest that atypical intrinsic brain properties in males with ASD partly reflect mechanisms involved in sexual differentiation. A model based on network-dependent atypical sex mosaicism can synthesize prior competing theories on factors involved in sex differentiation in ASD.
Lilies (Lilium sp.) are commercially important horticultural crops widely cultivated for their flowers and bulbs. Here, we conducted large-scale data mining of the lily transcriptome to develop transcription factor (TF)-associated microsatellite markers (TFSSRs). Among 216,768 unigenes extracted from our sequence data, 6966 unigenes harbored simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Seventy-one SSRs were associated with TF genes, and these were used to design primers and validate their potential as markers. These 71 SSRs were accomplished with 31 transcription factor families; including bHLH, MYB, C2H2, ERF, C3H, NAC, bZIP, and so on. Fourteen highly polymorphic SSRs were selected based on Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) values and used to study genetic diversity and population structure in lily accessions. Higher genetic diversity was observed in Longiflorum compared to Oriental and Asiatic populations. Lily accessions were divided into three sub-populations based in our structure analysis, and an un-rooted neighbor-joining tree effectively separated the accessions according to Asiatic, Oriental, and Longiflorum subgroups. Finally, we showed that 46 of the SSR-associated genes were differentially expressed in response to Botrytiselliptica infection. Thus, our newly developed TFSSR markers represent a powerful tool for large-scale genotyping, high-density and comparative mapping, marker-aided backcrossing, and molecular diversity analysis of Lilium sp.
The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the actions of the steroid hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone at the level of gene transcription. The main transactivation function is modular in structure, maps to the N-terminal domain (NTD), and is termed AF1. This region of the AR is structurally flexible and functions in multiple protein-protein interactions with coregulatory proteins and components of the general transcription machinery. Using surface plasmon resonance, the binding kinetics for the interaction of AR-AF1 with the large subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIF, termed RAP74, and the coactivator SRC-1a were measured. AR-AF1 interacts with both the NTD and CTD of RAP74 and the CTD of SRC-1a. The dissociation constants ( Kd) for the binding of polypeptides derived from RAP74 are in the submicromolar range, while a peptide from SRC-1a bound with a Kd of 14 microM. Significantly, the individual NTD and CTD of RAP74 interacted with AR-AF1 with distinct binding kinetics, with the NTD exhibiting slower on and off rates. TFIIF is involved in transcription initiation and elongation, and the CTD of RAP74 binds to the RNA polymerase II enzyme, the general transcription factor TFIIB, and a CTD phosphatase, FCP1. We have mutated hydrophobic residues in the RAP74-CTD structure to disrupt secondary structure elements and show that binding of AR-AF1 depends upon helix 3 in the winged-helix domain of the RAP74-CTD polypeptide. Altogether, a model is suggested for AR-AF1-dependent transactivation of receptor-target genes.
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1A catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the transport of long chain acyl-CoAs from cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix by converting them to acylcarnitines. Located within the outer mitochondrial membrane, CPT1A activity is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, its allosteric inhibitor. In this study, we investigate for the first time the quaternary structure of rat CPT1A. Chemical cross-linking studies using intact mitochondria isolated from fed rat liver or from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing CPT1A show that CPT1A self-assembles into an oligomeric complex. Size exclusion chromatography experiments using solubilized mitochondrial extracts suggest that the fundamental unit of its quaternary structure is a trimer. When studied in blue native-PAGE, the CPT1A hexamer could be observed, however, suggesting that under these native conditions CPT1A trimers might be arranged as dimers. Moreover, the oligomeric state of CPT1A was found unchanged by starvation and by streptozotocin-induced diabetes, conditions characterized by changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT1A. Finally, gel filtration analysis of several yeast-expressed chimeric CPTs demonstrates that the first 147 N-terminal residues of CPT1A, encompassing its two transmembrane segments, trigger trimerization independently of its catalytic C-terminal domain. Deletion of residues 1-82, including transmembrane 1, did not abrogate oligomerization, but the latter is limited to a trimer by the presence of the large catalytic C-terminal domain on the cytosolic face of mitochondria. Based on these findings, we proposed that the oligomeric structure of CPT1A would allow the newly formed acylcarnitines to gain direct access into the intermembrane space, hence facilitating substrate channeling.
Although nickel and cobalt compounds have been known to cause induction of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and activation of a battery of hypoxia-inducible genes in the cell, the molecular mechanisms of this induction remain unclear. The post-translational modification of HIF-1a, the oxygen-sensitive subunit of HIF-1, regulates stabilization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding activity, and transcriptional activity of the protein. Among the enzymes regulating the post-translational modification of HIF-la, the factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) hydroxylates the protein at asparagine 803, suppressing the interaction of HIF-1a with transcription coactivators p300/CBP and reducing the transcriptional activity of the protein. ARD-1, the acetyltransferase, acetylates HIF-1a at lysine 532, which enhances the interaction of HIF-1a with pVHL. Therefore, FIH-1 and ARD-1 negatively regulate the transcriptional activity and the stability of HIF-1a. We examined the mRNA levels of FIH-l and ARD-1 genes after exposure nickel (II) or cobalt (II) to the cell and found that both genes were down-regulated by the chemical treatment, which may lead to reduced levels of both proteins and result in increased level of HIF-1 a and its transcriptional activity.
Modulators of cofactor recruitment by nuclear receptors are expected to play an important role in the coordination of hormone-induced transactivation processes. To identify such factors interacting with the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the progesterone receptor (PR), we used this domain as bait in the yeast Sos-Ras two-hybrid system. cDNAs encoding the C-terminal MYST (MOZ-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60 acetyltransferases) domain of HBO1 [histone acetyltransferase binding to the origin recognition complex (ORC) 1 subunit], a member of the MYST acetylase family, were thus selected from a human testis cDNA library. In transiently transfected CV1 cells, the wild-type HBO1 [611 amino acids (aa)] enhanced transcription mediated by steroid receptors, notably PR, mineralocorticoid receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor, and strongly induced PR and estrogen receptor coactivation by steroid receptor coactivator 1a (SRC-1a). As assessed by two-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays, the HBO1 MYST acetylase domain (aa 340-611) interacts mainly with the NTD, and also contacts the DNA-binding domain and the hinge domains of hormone-bound PR. The HBO1 N-terminal region (aa 1-340) associates additionally with PR ligand-binding domain (LBD). HBO1 was found also to interact through its NTD with SRC-1a in the absence of steroid receptor. The latter coassociation enhanced specifically activation function 2 activation function encompassed in the LBD. Conversely, the MYST acetylase domain specifically enhanced SRC-1 coupling with PR NTD, through a hormone-dependent mechanism. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing human PRA or PRB, HBO1 raised selectively an SRC-1-dependent response of PRB but failed to regulate PRA activity. We show that HBO1 acts through modification of an LBD-controlled structure present in the N terminus of PRB leading to the modulation of SRC-1 functional coupling with activation function 3-mediated transcription. Importantly, real-time RT-PCR analysis also revealed that HBO1 enhanced SRC-1 coactivation of PR-dependent transcription of human endogenous genes such as alpha-6 integrin and 11beta-hydroxydehydrogenase 2 but not that of amphiregulin. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of human embryonic kidney-PRB cells demonstrated that the hormone induces the colocalization of HBO1 with PR-SRC-1 complex into nuclear speckles characteristic of PR-mediated chromatin remodeling. Our results suggest that HBO1 might play an important physiological role in human PR signaling.
Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), expressed as TRalpha1, TRbeta1, and TRbeta2 isoforms, are members of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor gene superfamily, which comprises ligand-dependent transcription factors. The TR isoforms differ primarily in their N-terminal (A/B) domains, suggesting that the A/B regions mediate distinct transcriptional activation functions in a cell type-dependent or promoter-specific fashion. The nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD) undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding that results in the recruitment of coactivators to the LBD. For glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor-alpha, the same coactivator can contact both the LBD and A/B domains, thus leading to enhanced transcriptional activation. Very little is known regarding the role of the A/B domains of the TR isoforms. The A/B domain of TRbeta2 exhibits higher ligand-independent transcriptional activity than the A/B regions of TRalpha1 or TRbeta1. Thus, we examined the role of the A/B domain and the LBD of rat TRbeta2 in integrating the transcriptional activation function of the A/B and LBD domains by different coactivators. Both domains are essential for a productive functional interaction with cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), and we found that CBP binds to the A/B domain of TRbeta2 in vitro. In contrast, steroid receptor coactivator-1a (SRC-1a) interacts strongly with the LBD but not the A/B domain. The coactivator NRC (nuclear receptor coactivator) interacts primarily with the LBD, although a weak interaction with the A/B domain further enhances ligand-dependent binding with TRbeta2. Our studies document the interplay between the A/B domain and the LBD of TRbeta2 in recruiting different coactivators to the receptor. Because NRC and SRC-1a bind CBP, and CBP enhances ligand-dependent activity, our studies suggest a model in which coactivator recruitment of NRC (or SRC-1a) occurs primarily through the LBD whereas the complex is further stabilized through an interaction of CBP with the N terminus of TRbeta2.
The mechanisms of receptor- and cell-specific effects of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones via mineralo- (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are still poorly understood. Because the expression levels of two splice variants of the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) 1a and 1e, can differ significantly in certain cell populations, we tested the hypothesis that their relative abundance could determine cell- and receptor-specific effects of corticosteroid receptor-mediated transcription. In transient transfections, we demonstrate three novel types of SRC-1a- and SRC-1e-specific effects for corticosteroid receptors. One is promoter dependence: SRC-1e much more potently coactivated transcription from several multiple response element-containing promoters. Mammalian 1-hydrid studies indicated that this likely does not involve promoter-specific coactivator recruitment. Endogenous phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase mRNA induction via GRs was also differentially affected by the splice variants. Another type is receptor specificity: responses mediated by the N-terminal part of the MR, but not the GR, were augmented by SRC-1e at synergizing response elements. SRC fragment SRC(988-1240) by the MR but not the GR N-terminal fragment in a 1-hybrid assay. The last type, for GRs, is ligand dependence. Due to effects on partial agonism of RU486-activated GRs, different ratios of SRC-1a and 1e can lead to large differences in the extent of antagonism of RU486 on GR-mediated transcription. Furthermore, we show that SRC-1e but not SRC-1a mRNA expression was regulated in the pituitary by corticosterone. We conclude that the cellular differences in SRC-1a to SRC-1e ratio demonstrated in vivo might be involved in cell-specific responses to corticosteroids in a promoter- and ligand-dependent way.
In mammalian cells, the human adenovirus type 5 early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein functions as a thyroid hormone (TH)-dependent activator of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). Interestingly, in the cellular context of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, E1A acts as a TR-specific constitutive coactivator that is down-regulated by TH. TH reduces the interaction of E1A with the TR in yeast but not HeLa cells. The N-terminal 82 amino acids of E1A are sufficient for coactivation in yeast and residues 4-29 are essential. In yeast, expression of the nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) could down-regulate constitutive transcriptional activation of the TR by E1A, whereas expression of the glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) coactivator reconstituted the E1A-induced pattern of enhanced TH-dependent gene activation by TR observed in mammalian cells. We further show that the mating type switching gene (SWI)/sucrose nonfermenting (SNF) gene chromatin remodeling complex is required for both TH/GRIP-1- and E1A-dependent coactivator function, whereas the general control nonrepressed protein (GCN5)/alteration/deficiency in activation protein (ADA2) components of the SPT, ADA, GCN5, acetylation (SAGA) transcriptional adaptor complex are required for TH/GRIP-1, but not E1A-dependent activation of the TR. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the novel TR-specific coactivator function of E1A in yeast depends on the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and can be further influenced by changes in the cellular complement of transcriptional coregulatory proteins.
Among the three major POU proteins expressed in human skin, Oct-1, Tst-1/Oct-6, and Skn-1/Oct-11, only the latter induced SPRR2A, a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. In this study, we have identified three Skn-1 isoforms, which encode proteins with various N termini, generated by alternative promoter usage. These isotypes showed distinct expression patterns in various skin samples, internal squamous epithelia, and cultured human keratinocytes. Skn-1a and Skn-1d1 bound the SPRR2A octamer site with comparable affinity and functioned as transcriptional activators. Skn-1d2 did not affect SPRR2A expression. Skn-1a, the largest protein, functionally cooperated with Ese-1/Elf-3, an epithelial-specific transcription factor, previously implicated in SPRR2A induction. This cooperativity, which depended on an N-terminal pointed-like domain in Skn-1a, was not found for Skn-1d1. Actually, Skn-1d1 counteracted the cooperativity between Skn-1a and Ese-1. Apparently, the human Skn-1 locus encodes multifunctional protein isotypes, subjected to biochemical cross-talk, which are likely to play a major role in the fine-tuning of keratinocyte terminal differentiation.
Cellular cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in mammals is controlled by a family of transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding protein isoforms, three of which (SREBP-1a, 1c, and 2) are well characterized. These proteins, which are synthesized as precursors, are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with both the amino and carboxylic acid domains facing the cytosolic face of the membrane. In sterol-deficient cells, proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs occurs, thereby releasing their N-terminal mature and active forms and enabling them to enter the nucleus, where they bind to the sterol regulatory response element (SRE) and/or E-box sequences and activate genes involved in cholesterol, triglyceride, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Of the three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1c gene expression is induced by cholesterol and repressed by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We have examined the changes in SREBP-1c mRNA and protein levels as well as the mRNA levels of several SREBP-1c target genes when a high-cholesterol diet is combined with diets rich in PUFA of the n-6 series. Our studies show that PUFA oppose the cholesterol-mediated SREBP-1 maturation without affecting the cholesterol-mediated increase of SREBP-1c mRNA and precursor protein. The decrease in SREBP-1 mature protein paralleled the decrease in mRNAs for genes of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, such as HMG-CoA synthase and fatty acid synthase, but interestingly gene expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) was instead induced. These studies suggest that the main point of control of PUFA-mediated suppression of lipogenic gene expression is the inhibition of SREBP-1 maturation. The studies also reveal that the induction of SCD1 gene expression by cholesterol occurs through a mechanism independent of SREBP-1 maturation.
The human estrogen receptor (ERalpha) and the human estrogen receptor-related receptor (ERRalpha1, NR3B1a) are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. We previously cloned an isoform of ERRalpha1 cDNA and demonstrated that ERRalpha1 binds to the human lactoferrin gene promoter and enhances estrogen responsiveness during transient transfection experiments. In this study, we show that ERRalpha1 and ERalpha may interfere in each other's transcriptional activity by competition for binding and coactivator. A VP16-ERRalpha1 chimera was constructed and transiently transfected into human endometrial carcinoma HEC-1B cells. This chimera activated reporter constructs containing the human lactoferrin gene estrogen response element (ERE) and the synthetic palindromic 3X-ERE, suggesting that ERRalpha1 binds to these EREs. Therefore, ERRalpha1 can compete with ERalpha for binding to the same EREs. ERRalpha1 is organized into modules which include a N-terminal region that shows repression function, a Zn-finger region that binds DNA and an activation region at the C terminus. The activation function of ERRalpha1 was mapped to the conserved AF2 region in the C-terminus by deletion analysis. The transactivation activity of ERRalpha1 can be enhanced by coactivator (SRC-1a) and suppressed by ERalpha in the presence of estrogen, suggesting that SRC-1a is required by both receptors for their activity. The repression of ERRalpha1 activation function by estrogen bound ERalpha, however, could not be reversed by increasing concentration of SRC-1a in the cells. This finding is consistent with the squelching phenomenon that exists between ERalpha and other steroid receptor family members. The studies demonstrated that ERRalpha1 and ERalpha may potentially regulate the same target gene independently as well as interfere with each other's functional activity by competition for binding and coactivator.
Penicillin-binding protein 1b (PBP1b) is the major high-molecular-weight PBP in Escherichia coli. Although it is coded by a single gene, it is usually found as a mixture of three isoforms which vary with regard to the length of their N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. We show here that although the cytoplasmic tail seems to play no role in the dimerization of PBP1b, as was originally suspected, only the full-length protein is able to protect the cells against lysis when both PBP1a and PBP3 are inhibited by antibiotics. This suggests a specific role for the full-length PBP1b in the multienzyme peptidoglycan-synthesizing complex that cannot be fulfilled by either PBP1a or the shorter PBP1b proteins. Moreover, we have shown by alanine-stretch-scanning mutagenesis that (i) residues R(11) to G(13) are major determinants for correct translocation and folding of PBP1b and that (ii) the specific interactions involving the full-length PBP1b can be ascribed to the first six residues at the N-terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain. These results are discussed in terms of the interactions with other components of the murein-synthesizing complex.
Members of the 160-kDa nuclear receptor coactivator family (p160 coactivators) bind to the conserved AF-2 activation function found in the hormone binding domains of nuclear receptors (NR) and are potent transcriptional coactivators for NRs. Here we report that the C-terminal region of p160 coactivators glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1a), and SRC-1e binds the N-terminal AF-1 activation function of the androgen receptor (AR), and p160 coactivators can thereby enhance transcriptional activation by AR. While they all interact efficiently with AR AF-1, these same coactivators have vastly different binding strengths with and coactivator effects on AR AF-2. p160 activation domain AD1, which binds secondary coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300, was previously implicated as the principal domain for transmitting the activating signal to the transcription machinery. We identified a new highly conserved motif in the AD1 region which is important for CBP/p300 binding. Deletion of AD1 only partially reduced p160 coactivator function, due to signaling through AD2, another activation domain located at the C-terminal end of p160 coactivators. C-terminal coactivator fragments lacking AD1 but containing AD2 and the AR AF-1 binding site served as efficient coactivators for full-length AR and AR AF-1. The two signal input domains (one that binds NR AF-2 domains and one that binds AF-1 domains of some but not all NRs) and the two signal output domains (AD1 and AD2) of p160 coactivators played different relative roles for two different NRs: AR and thyroid hormone receptor.
The nucleotide sequence of the ponA gene encoding the high molecular-mass penicillin-binding protein 1A (PBP1A) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) PAO1 was determined and characterized. The predicted PBP1A protein of 822 amino acids (aa) has a calculated molecular mass of 91.2 kDa corresponding to the size of the protein expressed in vitro and in vivo. A penicillin-binding (PB) assay showed that the Pa ponA gene product covalently binds penicillin. The deduced PBP1A aa sequence has features typical of class-A high-molecular-mass PBPs: a highly hydrophobic N-terminus portion containing a potential transmembrane segment which might anchor the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane; an N-terminal module with the conserved boxes 1 (E86D(DN)F(AN)H(Y)G), 2 (G117GS(T)I(TM)Q), 3 (R139K(IN)E(ILL)AL) and 4 (R221R(NW)IL); a PB module with the conserved boxes 5 (S461SFK), (S520RN) and (K695TG); an internal extension at aa 297-407 between the N-terminal and PB modules; and a C-extension at the end of the PB module at aa 742 to 822. The highest percentage of similarity (62.8%) was found with the class A high-molecular-mass PBP1A of Escherichia coli (Ec) and Haemophilus influenzae. The observed extensive homology in the modular design of the Pa PBP1A with the bifunctional Ec PBP1A suggests structural and functional relationships between these proteins and refutes the proposed correspondence between Pa PBP1A and Ec PBP1B.
A new class of antifungal agents has been discovered which exert their activity by blockade of myristoylCoA: protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.1.3.97). Genetic experiments have established that NMT is needed to maintain the viability of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans,the two principal causes of systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised humans. Beginning with a weak octapeptide inhibitor ALYASKLS-NH2 (2, Ki = 15.3 +/- 6.4 microM), a series of imidazole-substituted Ser-Lys dipeptide amides have been designed and synthesized as potent and selective inhibitors of Candida albicans NMT. The strategy that led to these inhibitors evolved from the identification of those functional groups in the high-affinity octapeptide substrate GLYASKLS-NH2 1a necessary for tight binding, truncation of the C-terminus, replacement of the four amino acids at the N-terminus by a spacer group, and substitution of the glycine amino group with an N-linked 2-methylimidazole moiety. Initial structure-activity studies led to the identification of 31 as a potent and selective peptidomimetic inhibitor with an IC50 of 56 nM and 250-fold selectivity versus human NMT. 2-Methylimidazole as the N-terminal amine replacement in combination with a 4-substituted phenacetyl moiety imparts remarkable potency and selectivity to this novel class of inhibitors. The (S,S) stereochemistry of serine and lysine residues is critical for the inhibitory activity, since the (R,R) enantiomer 40 is 10(3)-fold less active than the (S,S) isomer 31. The inhibitory profile exhibited by this new class of NMT ligands is a function of the pKa of the imidazole substituent as illustrated by the benzimidazole analog 35 which is about 10-fold less potent than 31. The measured pKa (7.1 +/- 0.5) of 2-methylimidazole in 31 is comparable with the estimated pKa (approximately 8.0) of the glycyl residue in the high-affinity substrate 1a. Groups bulkier than methyl, such as ethyl, isopropyl, or iodo, at the imidazole 2-position have a detrimental effect on potency. Further refinement of 31 by grafting an alpha-methyl group at the benzylic position adjacent to the serine residue led to 61 with an IC50 of 40 nM. Subsequent chiral chromatography of 61 culminated in the discovery of the most potent Candida NMT inhibitor 61a reported to date with an IC50 of 20 nM and 400-fold selectivity versus the human enzyme. Both 31 and 61a are competitive inhibitors of Candida NMT with respect to the octapeptide substrate GNAASARR-NH2 with Ki(app) = 30 and 27 nM, respectively. The potency and selectivity displayed by these inhibitors are dependent upon the size and orientation of the alpha-substituent. An alpha-methyl group with the R configuration corresponding to the (S)-methyl-4-alanine in 2 confers maximum potency and selectivity. Structural modification of 31 and 61 by appending an (S)-carboxyl group beta to the cyclohexyl moiety provided the less potent tripeptide inhibitors 73a and 73b with an IC50 of 1.45 +/- 0.08 and 0.38 +/- 0.03 microM, respectively. However, these tripeptides (73a and 73b) exhibited a pronounced selectivity of 560- and 2200-fold versus the human NMT. More importantly 73a displayed fungistatic activity against C albicans with an EC50 of 51 +/- 17 microM in cell culture. Compound 73b also exhibited a similar antifungal activity. An Arf protein gel mobility shift assay for monitoring intracellular myristoylation revealed that a single dose of 200 microM of 73a or 73b produced &lt; 50% reduction in Arf N-myristoylation, after 24 and 48 h, consistent with their fungistatic rather than fungicidal activity. In contrast, the enantiomer 73d which had an IC50 &gt; 1000 microM against C. albicans NMT did not exhibit antifungal activity and produced no detectable reduction in Arf N-myristoylation in cultures of C. albicans. These studies confirm that the observed antifungal activity of 73a and 73b is due to the attenuation of NMT activity and that NMT represents an attractive tar
The early region 1A (E1A) gene of highly oncogenic adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) was analyzed for transforming activity and protein binding using specific mutations. The Ad12 E1A proteins were found to bind p300 protein mainly within the CR1 region, although mutations that affect both p300 binding and transformation were identified in both the CR1 and the N-terminal region. The most critical mutation dlf89 located in the CR1 region was further dissected by point mutations and the results identified 68S as the most critical for transformation and 67E as the most critical for p300 binding. Specific mutations that retain p300 binding but impair transcriptional repression of a viral enhancer were also identified in both the N-terminal and CR1 regions.
The adipocyte is the principal cell type for fat storage. CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid β-oxidation, but the physiological role of CPT1 in adipocytes remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on the specific role of CPT1A in the normal functioning of adipocytes. Three 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lines stably expressing hCPT1A (human CPT1A) cDNA, mouse CPT1A shRNA (short-hairpin RNA) or GFP (green fluorescent protein) were generated and the biological functions of these cell lines were characterized. Alteration in CPT1 activity, either by ectopic overexpression or pharmacological inhibition using etomoxir, did not affect adipocyte differentiation. However, overexpression of hCPT1A significantly reduced the content of intracellular NEFAs (non-esterified fatty acids) compared with the control cells when adipocytes were challenged with fatty acids. The changes were accompanied by an increase in fatty acid uptake and a decrease in fatty acid release. Interestingly, CPT1A protected against fatty acid-induced insulin resistance and expression of pro-inflammatory adipokines such as TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-α) and IL-6 (interleukin-6) in adipocytes. Further studies demonstrated that JNK (c-Jun N terminal kinase) activity was substantially suppressed upon CPT1A overexpression, whereas knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of CPT1 caused a significant enhancement of JNK activity. The specific inhibitor of JNK SP600125 largely abolished the changes caused by the shRNA- and etomoxir-mediated decrease in CPT1 activity. Moreover, C2C12 myocytes co-cultured with adipocytes pre-treated with fatty acids displayed altered insulin sensitivity. Taken together, our findings have identified a favourable role for CPT1A in adipocytes to attenuate fatty acid-evoked insulin resistance and inflammation via suppression of JNK.
Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a critical mediator of tumor angiogenesis, is a well-characterized target of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Murine arrest-defective protein 1A (mARD1A(225)) acetylates HIF-1alpha, triggering its degradation, and thus may play a role in decreased expression of VEGFA.
We generated Apc(Min/+)/mARD1A(225) transgenic mice and quantified growth of intestinal polyps. Human gastric MKN74 and murine melanoma B16F10 cells overexpressing mARD1A(225) were injected into mice, and tumor growth and metastasis were measured. VEGFA expression and microvessel density in tumors were assessed using immunohistochemistry. To evaluate the role of mARD1A(225) acetylation of Lys532 in HIF-1alpha, we injected B16F10-mARD1A(225) cell lines stably expressing mutant HIF-1alpha/K532R into mice and measured metastasis. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
Apc(Min/+)/mARD1A(225) transgenic mice (n = 25) had statistically significantly fewer intestinal polyps than Apc(Min/+) mice (n = 21) (number of intestinal polyps per mouse: Apc(Min/+) mice vs Apc(Min/+)/mARD1A(225) transgenic mice, mean = 83.4 vs 38.0 polyps, difference = 45.4 polyps, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.8 to 48.6; P &lt; .001). The growth and metastases of transplanted tumors were also statistically significantly reduced in mice injected with mARD1A(225)-overexpressing cells than in mice injected with control cells (P &lt; .01). Moreover, overexpression of mARD1A(225) decreased VEGFA expression and microvessel density in tumor xenografts (P &lt; .04) and Apc(Min/+) intestinal polyps (P = .001). Mutation of lysine 532 of HIF-1alpha in B16F10-mARD1A(225) cells prevented HIF-1alpha degradation and inhibited the antimetastatic effect of mARD1A(225) (P &lt; .001).
mARD1A(225) may be a novel upstream target that blocks VEGFA expression and tumor-related angiogenesis.
Malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT) transfers the malonyl group from malonyl-CoA to holo-acyl carrier protein (ACP), and since malonyl-ACP is a key building block for fatty-acid biosynthesis it is considered as a promising antibacterial target. The crystal structures of MCAT from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been determined at 1.46 and 2.1A resolution, respectively. In the SaMCAT structure, the N-terminal expression peptide of a neighboring molecule running in the opposite direction of malonyl-CoA makes extensive interactions with the highly conserved "Gly-Gln-Gly-Ser-Gln" stretch, suggesting a new design platform. Mutagenesis results suggest that Ser91 and His199 are the catalytic dyad.
Glucosyltransferases (Gtrs) and O-acetyltransferase (Oac) are integral membrane proteins embedded within the cytoplasmic membrane of Shigella flexneri. Gtrs and Oac are responsible for unidirectional host serotype conversion by altering the epitopic properties of the bacterial surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen. In this study, we present the membrane topology of a recently recognized Gtr, GtrIc, which is known to mediate S. flenxeri serotype switching from 1a to 1c. The GtrIc topology is shown to deviate from those typically seen in S. flexneri Gtrs. GtrIc has 11 hydrophilic loops, 10 transmembrane helices, a double intramembrane dipping loop 5, and a cytoplasmic N- and C-terminus. Along with a unique membrane topology, the identification of non-critical Gtr-conserved peptide motifs within large periplasmic loops (N-terminal D/ExD/E and C-terminal KK), which have previously been proven essential for the activity of other Gtrs, challenge current opinions of a similar mechanism for enzyme function between members of the S. flexneri Gtr family.
The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein mediates cell transformation by deregulating host cellular processes and activating viral gene expression by recruitment of cellular proteins that include cyclic-AMP response element binding (CREB) binding protein (CBP)/p300 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). While E1A is capable of independent interaction with CBP/p300 or pRb, simultaneous binding of both proteins is required for maximal biological activity. To obtain insights into the mechanism by which E1A hijacks the cellular transcription machinery by competing with essential transcription factors for binding to CBP/p300, we have determined the structure of the complex between the transcriptional adaptor zinc finger-2 (TAZ2) domain of CBP and the conserved region-1 (CR1) domain of E1A. The E1A CR1 domain is unstructured in the free state and upon binding folds into a local helical structure mediated by an extensive network of intermolecular hydrophobic contacts. By NMR titrations, we show that E1A efficiently competes with the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 for binding to TAZ2 and that pRb interacts with E1A at 2 independent sites located in CR1 and CR2. We show that pRb and the CBP TAZ2 domain can bind simultaneously to the CR1 site of E1A to form a ternary complex and propose a structural model for the pRb:E1A:CBP complex on the basis of published x-ray data for homologous binary complexes. These observations reveal the molecular basis by which E1A inhibits p53-mediated transcriptional activation and provide a rationale for the efficiency of cellular transformation by the adenoviral E1A oncoprotein.
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) controls the rate of entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation and has been reported to exist as an oligomer. We have investigated the in vivo oligomerization of full-length rat CPT1A (rCPT1A) along with those of the N-terminal truncation/deletion mutants Delta(1-82), Delta(1-18), and Delta(19-30) expressed in yeast mitochondria. The data indicate that in liver mitochondria in vivo CPT1A exists as a hexamer but that during preparation and storage of mitochondria the order of oligomerization is rapidly reduced to the trimer, such that a mixture of hexamer and trimer is observed in isolated mitochondria in vitro. Mutants bearing deletions of different segments of the N terminus (including the more N-terminal of the two transmembrane domains) have the same pattern of oligomerization when expressed in yeast mitochondria. The self-association of the individual rCPT1A transmembrane (TM) domains (TM1, TM2) was also studied using the TOXCAT assay (which measures TM self-association in the Escherichia coli inner membrane). There was minimal self-association of the sequence corresponding to TM1 but significant self-association of TM2 in TOXCAT. Chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation of a TM2-derived synthetic peptide showed oligomerization with a similar trimer/hexamer equilibrium to that observed for native rCPT1A in isolated mitochondria. Therefore, there was a correlation between the oligomerization behavior of TM2 peptide and that of the full-length protein. In silico molecular modeling of rCPT1A TM2 highlighted the favorable orientation of GXXXG and GXXXA motifs in the formation of the TM2 hexamer.
Human carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) is a highly malonyl-CoA-sensitive enzyme (IC50=0.097 microm) and has a positive determinant (residues 18-28) of malonyl-CoA inhibition. By contrast, rat carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A is less sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition (IC(50)=1.9 microm), and has both a positive (residues 1-18) and a negative (residues 18-28) determinant of its inhibition. Interestingly, pig CPT1B shows a low degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (IC(50)=0.804 microm). Here, we examined whether any additional molecular determinants affect malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT1B. We show that the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT1B is determined by the length (either 50 or 128 residues) of the N-terminal region constructed by recombining pig and human enzymes. We also show that the N-terminal region of pig CPT1B carries a single positive determinant of malonyl-CoA sensitivity, but that this is located between residues 1 and 18 of the N-terminal segment. Importantly, we found a single amino acid variation (D17E) relevant to malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Thus, Asp17 is specifically involved, under certain assay conditions, in the high malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the human enzyme, whereas the naturally occurring variation, Glu17, is responsible for both the low malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high carnitine affinity characteristics of the pig enzyme. This is the first demonstration that a single naturally occurring amino acid variation can alter CPT1B enzymatic properties.
p48, also called Ptf1a (pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a), is a tissue-restricted bHLH (basic helix loop helix) transcription factor which is critical for pancreatic commitment during development and for the activation and maintenance of the acinar differentiation programme in the exocrine pancreas. High-level expression of exocrine digestive enzymes, a hallmark of mature acinar cells, depends largely on the trimeric complex PTF1, formed by p48, RBP-L (recombination signal-binding protein 1-like) and a class A bHLH protein. In addition, p48 induces cell-cycle exit by controlling G(1)/S-phase progression. However, the mechanisms that mediate PTF1-dependent gene activation are poorly understood. In the present study, we report that p48 increases transcription through two activation domains located in its N-terminal region by recruiting transcriptional co-activators. The histone acetyltransferase cofactor p/CAF {p300/CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein]-associated factor} interacts with p48 in acinar cells in vivo and is associated with the promoter region of acinar genes targeted by the PTF1 complex. p/CAF potentiates PTF1 transcriptional activity by enhancing selectively the p48 transactivation activity. p/CAF promotes the nuclear accumulation of p48 and its in vivo acetylation in Lys(200). The K200R mutation abolishes the transcriptional activity of p48, as well as its capacity to functionally co-operate with RBP-L to ensure effective PTF1-driven transcription, indicating that p/CAF-mediated acetylation of p48 is required for the full transcriptional activity of PTF1. In contrast, p/CAF did not co-operate with p48 in its growth regulatory effects. These results support a critical and selective role of p/CAF in PTF1-dependent gene activation during acinar differentiation.
Many viruses deregulate the cell and force transcription of viral genes by competing with cellular proteins for binding to the transcriptional co-activators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. Through its interactions with CBP/p300 and the retinoblastoma protein, the adenovirus (AdV) early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein hijacks the cell cycle and, in rodents, transforms the cell; the mechanistic and structural basis for these effects remain unclear. In this study we compare the affinity of protein constructs from the E1A proteins from two adenovirus serotypes, non-oncogenic AdV5 and highly oncogenic AdV12, for binding to the nuclear receptor coactivator binding domain (NCBD) of CBP. NMR spectra show that the E1A constructs from both serotypes are intrinsically disordered in the free state and that each contains three homologous binding sites for the NCBD, one in the N-terminal region and two within conserved region 1 (CR1) of E1A. The binding sites in CR1 correspond to the motifs that bind the retinoblastoma protein and the TAZ2 domain of CBP/p300. The E1A and NCBD peptides fold synergistically upon complex formation. Binding affinities determined from NMR titrations show that, although the overall affinities for AdV5 and AdV12 E1A are comparable, there are significant differences between the two E1A serotypes in the relative strength with which their constituent interaction motifs bind to the NCBD. The individual E1A interaction motifs were unable to compete effectively with p53 for binding to the NCBD and both the N-terminal region and CR1 region of E1A are required for efficient competition with p53.
The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein hijacks host cells via direct interactions with many key cellular proteins, such as KAT2B, also known as PCAF (p300/CBP associated factor). E1A binds the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of KAT2B to repress its transcriptional activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which E1A inhibits the HAT activity is not known. Here we demonstrate that a short and relatively conserved N-terminal motif (cNM) in the intrinsically disordered E1A protein is crucial for KAT2B interaction, and inhibits its HAT activity through a direct competition with acetyl-CoA, but not its substrate histone H3. Molecular modeling together with a series of mutagenesis experiments suggests that the major helix of E1A cNM binds to a surface of the acetyl-CoA pocket of the KAT2B HAT domain. Moreover, transient expression of the cNM peptide is sufficient to inhibit KAT2B-specific H3 acetylation H3K14ac in vivo Together, our data define an essential motif cNM in N-terminal E1A as an acetyl-CoA entry blocker that directly associates with the entrance of acetyl-CoA binding pocket to block the HAT domain access to its cofactor.
Several natural compounds found in health-related food items can inhibit acetyltransferases as they induce autophagy. Here we show that this applies to anacardic acid, curcumin, garcinol and spermidine, all of which reduce the acetylation level of cultured human cells as they induce signs of increased autophagic flux (such as the formation of green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) puncta and the depletion of sequestosome-1, p62/SQSTM1) coupled to the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We performed a screen to identify the acetyltransferases whose depletion would activate autophagy and simultaneously inhibit mTORC1. The knockdown of only two acetyltransferases (among 43 candidates) had such effects: EP300 (E1A-binding protein p300), which is a lysine acetyltranferase, and NAA20 (N(α)-acetyltransferase 20, also known as NAT5), which catalyzes the N-terminal acetylation of methionine residues. Subsequent studies validated the capacity of a pharmacological EP300 inhibitor, C646, to induce autophagy in both normal and enucleated cells (cytoplasts), underscoring the capacity of EP300 to repress autophagy by cytoplasmic (non-nuclear) effects. Notably, anacardic acid, curcumin, garcinol and spermidine all inhibited the acetyltransferase activity of recombinant EP300 protein in vitro. Altogether, these results support the idea that EP300 acts as an endogenous repressor of autophagy and that potent autophagy inducers including spermidine de facto act as EP300 inhibitors. 
The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) in alcohol induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key mechanism of ALD.
We examined ER stress, lipogenesis, hyperhomocysteinemia, mitochondrial cholesterol (mChol) trafficking and susceptibility to LPS and concanavalin-A in ASMase(-)(/-) mice fed alcohol.
Alcohol feeding increased SREBP-1c, DGAT-2, and FAS mRNA in ASMase(+/+) but not in ASMase(-/-) mice. Compared to ASMase(+/+) mice, ASMase(-/-) mice exhibited decreased expression of ER stress markers induced by alcohol, but the level of tunicamycin-mediated upregulation of ER stress markers and steatosis was similar in both types of mice. The increase in homocysteine levels induced by alcohol feeding was comparable in both ASMase(+/+) and ASMase(-/-) mice. Exogenous ASMase, but not neutral SMase, induced ER stress by perturbing ER Ca(2+) homeostasis. Moreover, alcohol-induced mChol loading and StARD1 overexpression were blunted in ASMase(-/-) mice. Tunicamycin upregulated StARD1 expression and this outcome was abrogated by tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Alcohol-induced liver injury and sensitization to LPS and concanavalin-A were prevented in ASMase(-/-) mice. These effects were reproduced in alcohol-fed TNFR1/R2(-/-) mice. Moreover, ASMase does not impair hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy. Of relevance, liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis exhibited increased expression of ASMase, StARD1, and ER stress markers.
Our data indicate that ASMase is critical for alcohol-induced ER stress, and provide a rationale for further clinical investigation in ALD.
The enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which is anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), controls the rate-limiting step in fatty acid β-oxidation in mammalian tissues. It is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate of fatty acid synthesis, and it responds to OMM curvature and lipid characteristics, which reflect long term nutrient/hormone availability. Here, we show that the N-terminal regulatory domain (N) of CPT1A can adopt two complex amphiphilic structural states, termed Nα and Nβ, that interchange in a switch-like manner in response to offered binding surface curvature. Structure-based site-directed mutageneses of native CPT1A suggest Nα to be inhibitory and Nβ to be noninhibitory, with the relative Nα/Nβ ratio setting the prevalent malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme. Based on the amphiphilic nature of N and molecular modeling, we propose malonyl-CoA sensitivity to be coupled to the properties of the OMM by Nα-OMM associations that alter the Nα/Nβ ratio. For enzymes residing at the membrane-water interface, this constitutes an integrative regulatory mechanism of exceptional sophistication.
In the course of a day, the Neurospora clock protein FREQUENCY (FRQ) is progressively phosphorylated at up to 113 sites and eventually degraded. Phosphorylation and degradation are crucial for circadian time keeping, but it is not known how phosphorylation of a large number of sites correlates with circadian degradation of FRQ. We show that two amphipathic motifs in FRQ interact over a long distance, bringing the positively charged N-terminal portion in spatial proximity to the negatively charged middle and C-terminal portion of FRQ. The interaction is essential for the recruitment of casein kinase 1a (CK1a) into a stable complex with FRQ. FRQ-bound CK1a progressively phosphorylates the positively charged N-terminal domain of FRQ at up to 46 nonconsensus sites, triggering a conformational change, presumably by electrostatic repulsion, that commits the protein for degradation via the PEST1 signal in the negatively charged central portion of FRQ.
Protein modifications are biologically important events that may be studied by mass spectrometry-based high-throughput proteome analyses. In recent years, several new technologies have emerged that have widened and deepened the targeted analysis of one important, albeit functionally ill-defined modification, namely protein acetylation. This modification can take place both co- and post-translationally by the transfer of acetyl groups under the catalysis of acetyltransferases. The acetyl group can modify either the α-amino group at the N-terminus, so-called N-terminal acetylation, or the ε-amino group on the side chain of lysine residues. Here, we review several emerging targeted technologies to chart both N-terminal acetylation as well as acetylation at the lysine side chain, on a proteome-wide scale, highlighting in particular studies that have expanded the biological knowledge on the appearance and function of these common but functionally still less investigated co- and post-translational modifications.
Histone posttranslational modifications and chromatin dynamics are inextricably linked to eukaryotic gene expression. Among the many modifications that have been characterized, histone tail acetylation is most strongly correlated with transcriptional activation. In Metazoa, promoters of transcriptionally active genes are generally devoid of physically repressive nucleosomes, consistent with the contemporaneous binding of the large RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. The histone acetyltransferase p300 is also detected at active gene promoters, flanked by regions of histone hyperacetylation. Although the correlation between histone tail acetylation and gene activation is firmly established, the mechanisms by which acetylation facilitates this fundamental biological process remain poorly understood. To explore the role of acetylation in nucleosome dynamics, we utilized an immobilized template carrying a natural promoter reconstituted with various combinations of wild-type and mutant histones. We find that the histone H3 N-terminal tail is indispensable for activator, p300, and acetyl-CoA-dependent nucleosome eviction mediated by the histone chaperone Nap1. Significantly, we identify H3 lysine 14 as the essential p300 acetylation substrate required for dissociation of the histone octamer from the promoter DNA. Together, a total of 11 unique mutant octamer sets corroborated these observations and revealed a striking correlation between nucleosome eviction and strong activator and acetyl-CoA-dependent transcriptional activation. These novel findings uncover an exclusive role for H3 lysine 14 acetylation in facilitating the ATP-independent and transcription-independent disassembly of promoter nucleosomes by Nap1. Furthermore, these studies directly couple nucleosome disassembly with strong, activator-dependent transcription.
O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is a family 84 glycoside hydrolase catalyzing the hydrolytic cleavage of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) from serine and threonine residues of proteins. Thus far, three forms of OGA have been identified in humans. Here we optimized the expression of these isoforms in E. coli and characterized their kinetic properties. Using Geno 3D, we predicted that N-terminal amino acids 63-342 form the catalytic site for O-GlcNAc removal and characterized it. Large differences are observed in the K(m) value and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) for the three OGA variants, though all of them displayed O-GlcNAc hydrolase activity. The full-length OGA had the lowest K(m) value of 0.26 mM and the highest catalytic efficiency of 3.51.10(3). These results reveal that the N-terminal region (a.a. 1-350) of OGA contains the catalytic site for glycoside hydrolase and the C-terminal region of the coding sequence has the ability to stabilize the native three-dimensional structure and further affect substrate affinity.
A global regulatory complex made up of two unconventional transcriptional factors, CarD and CarG, is implicated in the control of various processes in Myxococcus xanthus, a Gram-negative bacterium that serves as a prokaryotic model system for multicellular development and the response to blue light. CarD has a unique two-domain architecture composed of: (1) a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that resembles eukaryotic high mobility group A (HMGA) proteins, which are relatively abundant, nonhistone components of chromatin that remodel DNA and prime it for the assembly of multiprotein-DNA complexes essential for various DNA transactions, and (2) an N-terminal domain involved in interactions with CarG and RNA polymerase, which is also the founding member of the large CarD_TRCF family of bacterial proteins. CarG, which does not bind DNA directly, has a zinc-binding motif of the type found in the archaemetzincin class of metalloproteases that, in CarG, appears to play a purely structural role. This review aims to provide an overview of the known molecular details and insights emerging from the study of the singular CarD-CarG prokaryotic regulatory complex and its parallels with enhanceosomes, the higher order, nucleoprotein transcription complexes in eukaryotes.
Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) catalyzes the conversion of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin, which is the immediate precursor for formation of melatonin. Although it is known that AANAT is degraded via the proteasomal proteolysis, detailed mechanisms are not defined. In this paper, we tested the in vivo role of proteasome inhibition on AANAT activity and melatonin release and examined the amino acid residues in AANAT that contribute to the proteasome degradation. We have shown that inhibition of proteasome activities in vivo in the intact pineal gland fails to prevent the light-induced suppression of melatonin secretion. Furthermore, in cell lines stably expressing AANAT, inhibition of proteasomal proteolysis, which resulted in a large accumulation of AANAT protein, similarly failed to increase AANAT enzyme activity proportional to the amount of proteins accumulated. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of AANAT revealed that the AANAT degradation is independent of lysine and the two surface cysteine residues. Deletion analysis of N-terminus identified the second amino acid leucine (L2) as the key residue that contributes to the proteasomal proteolysis of AANAT protein. These results suggest that rat AANAT protein is degraded via the N-end rule pathway of proteasomal proteolysis and the leucine at the N-terminus appears to be the key residue recognized by N-end rule pathway.
Many bacterial pathogens achieve resistance to defensin-like cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) by the multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) protein. MprF plays a crucial role in Staphylococcus aureus virulence and it is involved in resistance to the CAMP-like antibiotic daptomycin. MprF is a large membrane protein that modifies the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol with l-lysine, thereby diminishing the bacterial affinity for CAMPs. Its widespread occurrence recommends MprF as a target for novel antimicrobials, although the mode of action of MprF has remained incompletely understood. We demonstrate that the hydrophilic C-terminal domain and six of the fourteen proposed trans-membrane segments of MprF are sufficient for full-level lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) production and that several conserved amino acid positions in MprF are indispensable for Lys-PG production. Notably, Lys-PG production did not lead to efficient CAMP resistance and most of the Lys-PG remained in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane when the large N-terminal hydrophobic domain of MprF was absent, indicating a crucial role of this protein part. The N-terminal domain alone did not confer CAMP resistance or repulsion of the cationic test protein cytochrome c. However, when the N-terminal domain was coexpressed with the Lys-PG synthase domain either in one protein or as two separate proteins, full-level CAMP resistance was achieved. Moreover, only coexpression of the two domains led to efficient Lys-PG translocation to the outer leaflet of the membrane and to full-level cytochrome c repulsion, indicating that the N-terminal domain facilitates the flipping of Lys-PG. Thus, MprF represents a new class of lipid-biosynthetic enzymes with two separable functional domains that synthesize Lys-PG and facilitate Lys-PG translocation. Our study unravels crucial details on the molecular basis of an important bacterial immune evasion mechanism and it may help to employ MprF as a target for new anti-virulence drugs.
Rational design of recombinant antigens TB10.4 and TB10.4-Ag85B as subunit vaccine candidates against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The main purpose is to obtain a large quantity of soluble antigens.
Recombinant antigens were cloned in frame with the N-terminal thioredoxin and expressed in E. coli. The thioredoxin tag was removed by TEV protease. Nickel-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography were used to purify antigens to homogeneity. Antigen stability at different pH levels was studied by photon correlation spectrometry. Circular dichroism was used to probe antigen secondary structure and thermal stability.
N-terminal thioredoxin fusion dramatically increased antigen solubility. Soluble TB10.4 and TB10.4-Ag85B were purified to homogeneity and obtained in milligram quantity. Co-expression of bacteria chaperons increased the yield of TB10.4-Ag85B. Soluble TB10.4 and TB10.4-Ag85B purified from the inclusion body showed a reversible structure change. However, Ag85B and soluble TB10.4-Ag85B showed a clear melting temperature, above which the secondary structure was lost dramatically.
Soluble TB10.4 and TB10.4-Ag85B were purified from the E. coli in significant quantities. The methods to purify and characterize these recombinant antigens were established, which paved the way for further vaccine development based on these antigens.
The current view of ribosomal peptidyl transfer is that the ribosome is a ribozyme and that ribosomal proteins are not involved in catalysis of the chemical reaction. This view is largely based on the first crystal structures of bacterial large ribosomal subunits that did not show any protein components near the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Recent crystallographic data on the full 70S ribosome from Thermus thermophilus, however, show that ribosomal protein L27 extends with its N-terminus into the PTC in accordance with independent biochemical data, thus raising the question of whether the ribozyme picture is strictly valid. We have carried out extensive computer simulations of the peptidyl transfer reaction in the T. thermophilus ribosome to address the role of L27. The results show a reaction rate similar to that obtained in earlier simulations of the Haloarcula marismortui reaction. Furthermore, deletion of L27 is predicted to only give a minor rate reduction, in agreement with biochemical data, suggesting that the ribozyme view is indeed valid. The N-terminus of L27 is predicted to interact with the A76 phosphate group of the A-site tRNA, thereby explaining the observed impairment of A-site substrate binding for ribosomes lacking L27. Simulations are also reported for the reaction with puromycin, an A-site tRNA analogue which lacks the A76 phosphate group. The calculated energetics shows that this substrate can cause a downward p K a shift of L27 and that the reaction proceeds faster with the L27 N-terminus deprotonated, in contrast to the situation with aminoacyl-tRNA substrates. These results could explain the observed differences in pH dependence between the puromycin and C-puromycin reactions, where the former reaction has been seen to depend on an additional ionizing group besides the attacking amine, and our model predicts this ionizing group to be the N-terminal amine of L27.
The vast majority of the proteins encoded in any genome naturally undergo a large number of different N-terminal modifications, hindering their characterization by routine proteomic approaches. These modifications are often irreversible, usually cotranslational and are crucial, as their occurrence may reflect or affect the status, fate and function of the protein. For example, large signal peptide cleavages and N-blocking mechanisms reflect targeting to various cell compartments, whereas N-ligation events tend to be related to protein half-life. N-terminal positional proteomic strategies hold promise as a new generation of approaches to the fine analysis of such modifications. However, further biological investigation is required to resolve problems associated with particular low-abundance or challenging N-terminal modifications. Recent progress in genomics and bioinformatics has provided us with a means of assessing the impact of these modifications in proteomes. This review focuses on methods for characterizing the occurrence and diversity of N-terminal modifications and for assessing their contribution to function in complete proteomes. Progress is being made towards the annotation of databases containing information for complete proteomes, and should facilitate research into all areas of proteomics.
The biological properties of the calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs), daptomycin and related nonribosomal lipopeptides, depend to a large extent on the nature of the N-terminal fatty acid moiety. It is suggested that the chain length of the unusually short (C6) 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl fatty acid moiety of CDA is determined by the specificity of the KAS-II enzyme encoded by fabF3 in the CDA biosynthetic gene cluster. Indeed, deletion of the downstream gene hxcO results in three new lipopeptides, all of which possess hexanoyl side chains (hCDAs). This confirms that HxcO functions as a hexanoyl-CoA or -ACP oxidase. The absence of additional CDA products with longer fatty acid groups further suggests that the CDA lipid chain is biosynthesized on a single ACP and is then transferred directly from this ACP to the first CDA peptide synthetase (CdaPS1). Interestingly, the hexanoyl-containing CDAs retain antibiotic activity. To further modulate the biological properties of CDA by introducing alternative fatty acid groups, a mutasynthesis approach was developed. This involved mutating the key active site Ser residue of the CdaPS1, module 1 PCP domain to Ala, which prevents subsequent phosphopantetheinylation. In the absence of the natural module 1 PCP tethered intermediate, it is possible to effect incorporation of different N-acyl-L-serinyl N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) thioester analogues, leading to CDA products with pentanoyl as well as hexanoyl side chains.
The Escherichia coli outer membrane beta-barrel enzyme PagP and its homologues are unique in that the eight-stranded barrel is tilted by about 25 degrees with respect to the membrane normal and is preceded by a 19-residue amphipathic alpha-helix. To investigate the role of this helix in the folding and stability of PagP, mutants were generated in which the helix was deleted (Delta(1-19)), or in which residues predicted to be involved in helix-barrel interactions were altered (W17A or R59L). The ability of the variants to insert into detergent micelles or liposomes was studied in vitro using circular dichroism, fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrophoretic mobility and gain of enzyme activity. The data show that PagP, initially unfolded in 5% (w/v) perfluoro-octanoic acid or 6 M guanidinium chloride, inserts spontaneously and folds quantitatively to an active conformation into detergent micelles of cyclofos-7 or into large vesicles of diC(12:0)-phosphatidylcholine (diC(12:0)PC), respectively, the latter in the presence of 7 M urea. Successful refolding of all variants into both micelles and liposomes ruled out an essential role for the helix or helix-barrel interactions in folding and membrane insertion. Measurements of thermal stability indicated that the variants R59L, W17A/R59L and Delta(1-19) were destabilised substantially compared with wild-type PagP. However, in contrast to the other variants, destabilisation of the W17A variant relative to wild-type PagP was much greater in liposomes than in micelles. Analysis of the kinetics of folding and unfolding of all variants in diC(12:0)PC liposomes suggested that this destabilisation arises predominantly from an increased dissociation of the refolded variant proteins from the lipid-inserted state. The data support the view that the helix of PagP is not required for folding and assembly, but instead acts as a clamp, stabilising membrane-inserted PagP after folding and docking with the membrane are complete.
MAF, one of a family of large Maf bZIP transcription factors, is mutated in human developmental ocular disorders that include congenital cataract, microcornea, coloboma and anterior segment dysgenesis. Expressed early in the developing lens vesicle, it is central to regulation of lens crystallin gene expression. We report a semi-dominant mouse c-Maf mutation recovered after ENU mutatgenesis which results in the substitution, D90V, at a highly conserved residue within the N-terminal 35 amino-acid minimal transactivation domain (MTD). Unlike null and loss-of-function c-Maf mutations, which cause severe runting and renal abnormalities, the phenotype caused by the D90V mutation is isolated cataract. In reporter assays, D90V results in increased promoter activation, a situation similar to MTD mutations of NRL that also cause human disease. In contrast to wild-type protein, the c-Maf D90V mutant protein is not inhibited by protein kinase A-dependent pathways. The MTD of large Maf proteins has been shown to interact with the transcriptional co-activator p300 and we demonstrate that c-Maf D90V enhances p300 recruitment in a cell-type dependent manner. We observed the same for the pathogenic human NRL MTD mutation S50T, which suggests a common mechanism of action.
Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) catalyze the formation of pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminus of several peptides and proteins. On the basis of the amino acid sequence of Carica papaya QC, we identified cDNAs of the putative counterparts from Solanum tuberosum and Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon expression of the corresponding cDNAs from both plants via the secretory pathway of Pichia pastoris, two active QC proteins were isolated. The specificity of the purified proteins was assessed using various substrates with different amino acid composition and length. Highest specificities were observed with substrates possessing large hydrophobic residues adjacent to the N-terminal glutamine and for fluorogenic dipeptide surrogates. However, compared to Carica papaya QC, the specificity constants were approximately one order of magnitude lower for most of the QC substrates analyzed. The QCs also catalyzed the conversion of N-terminal glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid, but with approximately 10(5)- to 10(6)-fold lower specificity. The ubiquitous distribution of plant QCs prompted a search for potential substrates in plants. Based on database entries, numerous proteins, e.g., pathogenesis-related proteins, were found that carry a pyroglutamate residue at the N-terminus, suggesting QC involvement. The putative relevance of QCs and pyroglutamic acid for plant defense reactions is discussed.
Leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase (L/F-transferase) is an N-end rule pathway enzyme, which catalyzes the transfer of Leu and Phe from aminoacyl-tRNAs to exposed N-terminal Arg or Lys residues of acceptor proteins. Here, we report the 1.6 A resolution crystal structure of L/F-transferase (JW0868) from Escherichia coli, the first three-dimensional structure of an L/F-transferase. The L/F-transferase adopts a monomeric structure consisting of two domains that form a bilobate molecule. The N-terminal domain forms a small lobe with a novel fold. The large C-terminal domain has a highly conserved fold, which is observed in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family. Most of the conserved residues of L/F-transferase reside in the central cavity, which exists at the interface between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. A comparison of the structures of L/F-transferase and the bacterial peptidoglycan synthase FemX, indicated a structural homology in the C-terminal domain, and a similar domain interface region. Although the peptidyltransferase function is shared between the two proteins, the enzymatic mechanism would differ. The conserved residues in the central cavity of L/F-transferase suggest that this region is important for the enzyme catalysis.
Helicobacter pylorigamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (HpGT) is a glutathione-degrading enzyme that has been shown to be a virulence factor in infection. It is expressed as a 60-kDa inactive precursor that must undergo autocatalytic processing to generate a 40-kDa/20-kDa heterodimer with full gamma-glutamyl amide bond hydrolase activity. The new N terminus of the processed enzyme, Thr-380, is the catalytic nucleophile in both the autoprocessing and enzymatic reactions, indicating that HpGT is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. To further investigate activation as a result of autoprocessing, the structure of HpGT has been determined to a resolution of 1.9 A. The refined model contains two 40-kDa/20-kDa heterodimers in the asymmetric unit and has structural features comparable with other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases. Autoprocessing of HpGT leads to a large conformational change, with the loop preceding the catalytic Thr-380 moving &gt;35 A, thus relieving steric constraints that likely limit substrate binding. In addition, cleavage of the proenzyme results in the formation of a threonine-threonine dyad comprised of Thr-380 and a second conserved threonine residue, Thr-398. The hydroxyl group of Thr-398 is located equidistant from the alpha-amino group and hydroxyl side chain of Thr-380. Mutation of Thr-398 to an alanine results in an enzyme that is fully capable of autoprocessing but is devoid of enzymatic activity. Substrate docking studies in combination with homology modeling studies of the human homologue reveal additional mechanistic details of enzyme maturation and activation, substrate recognition, and catalysis.
The NAD(+)-dependent malic enzyme (DME) and the NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme (TME) of Sinorhizobium meliloti are representatives of a distinct class of malic enzymes that contain a 440-amino-acid N-terminal region homologous to other malic enzymes and a 330-amino-acid C-terminal region with similarity to phosphotransacetylase enzymes (PTA). We have shown previously that dme mutants of S. meliloti fail to fix N(2) (Fix(-)) in alfalfa root nodules, whereas tme mutants are unimpaired in their N(2)-fixing ability (Fix(+)). Here we report that the amount of DME protein in bacteroids is 10 times greater than that of TME. We therefore investigated whether increased TME activity in nodules would allow TME to function in place of DME. The tme gene was placed under the control of the dme promoter, and despite elevated levels of TME within bacteroids, no symbiotic nitrogen fixation occurred in dme mutant strains. Conversely, expression of dme from the tme promoter resulted in a large reduction in DME activity and symbiotic N(2) fixation. Hence, TME cannot replace the symbiotic requirement for DME. In further experiments we investigated the DME PTA-like domain and showed that it is not required for N(2) fixation. Thus, expression of a DME C-terminal deletion derivative or the Escherichia coli NAD(+)-dependent malic enzyme (sfcA), both of which lack the PTA-like region, restored wild-type N(2) fixation to a dme mutant. Our results have defined the symbiotic requirements for malic enzyme and raise the possibility that a constant high ratio of NADPH + H(+) to NADP in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids prevents TME from functioning in N(2)-fixing bacteroids.
CtBP1 and CtBP2 are transcriptional co-repressors that modulate the activity of a large number of transcriptional repressors via the recruitment of chromatin modifiers. Many CtBP-regulated proteins are involved in pathways associated with tumorigenesis, including TGF-beta and Wnt signalling pathways and cell cycle regulators such as RB/p130 and HDM2, as well as adenovirus E1A. CtBP1 and CtBP2 are highly similar proteins, although evidence is emerging that their activity can be differentially regulated, particularly through the control of their subcellular localisation. CtBP2s from diverse species contain a unique N-terminus, absent in CtBP1 that plays a key role in controlling the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of the protein.
Here we show that amino acids (a.a.) 4-14 of CtBP2 direct CtBP2 into an almost exclusively nuclear distribution in cell lines of diverse origins. Whilst this sequence contains similarity to known nuclear localisation motifs, it cannot drive nuclear localisation of a heterologous protein, but rather has been shown to function as a p300 acetyltransferase-dependent nuclear retention sequence. Here we define the region of CtBP2 required to co-operate with a.a. 4-14 to promote CtBP2 nuclear accumulation as being within a.a. 1-119. In addition, we show that a.a. 120-445 of CtBP2 can also promote CtBP2 nuclear accumulation, independently of a.a. 4-14. Finally, CtBP1 and CtBP2 can form heterodimers, and we show that the interaction with CtBP2 is one mechanism whereby CtBP1 can be recruited to the nucleus.
Together, these findings represent key distinctions in the regulation of the functions of CtBP family members that may have important implications as to their roles in development, and cell differentiation and survival.
Post-translational modification of proteins is a key regulatory event in many cellular processes. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large DNA virus that contains about 150 open reading frames (ORF) which encode for more than 150 polypeptides, most of them without assigned function. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) followed by Post-Source Decay Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (PSD-MALDI-MS) revealed that ASFV protein pE120R, essential for virus transport from assembly sites to plasma membranes, is acetylated at the N-terminal Ala residue during infection. To our knowledge, this is the first acetylated ASFV protein described and this modification might be relevant to ASFV life cycle since many viruses use the acetylation signaling pathway as a primary target for viral proteins after infection.
We present the first large-scale survey of N-terminal protein maturation in archaea based on 873 proteomically identified N-terminal peptides from the two haloarchaea Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis. The observed protein maturation pattern can be attributed to the combined action of methionine aminopeptidase and N-terminal acetyltransferase and applies to cytosolic proteins as well as to a large fraction of integral membrane proteins. Both N-terminal maturation processes primarily depend on the amino acid in penultimate position, in which serine and threonine residues are over represented. Removal of the initiator methionine occurs in two-thirds of the haloarchaeal proteins and requires a small penultimate residue, indicating that methionine aminopeptidase specificity is conserved across all domains of life. While N-terminal acetylation is rare in bacteria, our proteomic data show that acetylated N termini are common in archaea affecting about 15% of the proteins and revealing a distinct archaeal N-terminal acetylation pattern. Haloarchaeal N-terminal acetyltransferase reveals narrow substrate specificity, which is limited to cleaved N termini starting with serine or alanine residues. A comparative analysis of 140 ortholog pairs with identified N-terminal peptide showed that acetylatable N-terminal residues are predominantly conserved amongst the two haloarchaea. Only few exceptions from the general N-terminal acetylation pattern were observed, which probably represent protein-specific modifications as they were confirmed by ortholog comparison.
Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gammaGT), a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily, initiates extracellular glutathione reclamation by cleaving the gamma-glutamyl amide bond of the tripeptide. This protein is translated as an inactive proenzyme that undergoes autoprocessing to become an active enzyme. The resultant N terminus of the cleaved proenzyme serves as a nucleophile in amide bond hydrolysis. Helicobacter pylori gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (HpGT) was selected as a model system to study the mechanistic details of autoprocessing and amide bond hydrolysis. In contrast to previously reported gammaGT, large quantities of HpGT were expressed solubly in the inactive precursor form. The 60-kDa proenzyme was kinetically competent to form the mature 40- and 20-kDa subunits and exhibited maximal autoprocessing activity at neutral pH. The activated enzyme hydrolyzed the gamma-glutamyl amide bond of several substrates with comparable rates, but exhibited limited transpeptidase activity relative to mammalian gammaGT. As with autoprocessing, maximal enzymatic activity was observed at neutral pH, with hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate as the rate-limiting step. Coexpression of the 20- and 40-kDa subunits of HpGT uncoupled autoprocessing from enzymatic activity and resulted in a fully active heterotetramer with kinetic constants similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The specific contributions of a conserved threonine residue (Thr380) to autoprocessing and hydrolase activities were examined by mutagenesis using both the standard and coexpression systems. The results of these studies indicate that the gamma-methyl group of Thr380 orients the hydroxyl group of this conserved residue, which is required for both the processing and hydrolase reactions.
Translation termination in eukaryotes is governed by two proteins, belonging to the class-1 (eRF1) and class-2 (eRF3) polypeptide release factors. eRF3 catalyzes hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate in the ribosome in the absence of mRNA, tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA but needs the presence of eRF1. It's known that eRF1 and eRF3 interact with each other in vitro and in vivo via their C-terminal regions. eRF1 consists of three domains - N, M, and C. In this study we examined the influence of individual domains of the human eRF1 on induction of the human eRF3 GTPase activity in the ribosome in vitro. It was shown that none of the N-, M-, C- and NM-domains induces eRF3 GTPase activity in presence of the ribosomes. MC-domain does induce GTPase activity of eRF3 but four times less efficient than full-length eRF1, therefore, MC-domain (and very likely M-domain) binds to the ribosome in the presence of eRF3. Based on these data and taking into account the data available in literature, a conclusion was drawn that the N domain of eRF1 is not essential for eRF1-dependent induction of the eRF3 GTPase activity. A working hypothesis is formulated, postulating that GTPase activity eRF3 during the translation termination is associated with the intermolecular interactions of GTP/GDP, GTPase center of the large ribosomal subunit (60S), MC-domain of eRF1, C-terminal region and GTP-binding domains of eRF3, but without participation of the N-terminal region of eRF3.
Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is a heterodimic enzyme that is generated from the precursor protein through posttranslational processing and catalyzes the hydrolysis of gamma-glutamyl bonds in gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione and/or the transfer of the gamma-glutamyl group to other amino acids and peptides. We have determined the crystal structure of GGT from Escherichia coli K-12 at 1.95 A resolution. GGT has a stacked alphabetabetaalpha fold comprising the large and small subunits, similar to the folds seen in members of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. The active site Thr-391, the N-terminal residue of the small subunit, is located in the groove, from which the pocket for gamma-glutamyl moiety binding follows. We have further determined the structure of the gamma-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate trapped by flash cooling the GGT crystal soaked in glutathione solution and the structure of GGT in complex with l-glutamate. These structures revealed how the gamma-glutamyl moiety and l-glutamate are recognized by the enzyme. A water molecule was seen on the carbonyl carbon of the gamma-glutamyl-Thr-391 Ogamma bond in the intermediate that is to be hydrolyzed. Notably the residues essential for GGT activity (Arg-114, Asp-433, Ser-462, and Ser-463 in E. coli GGT) shown by site-directed mutagenesis of human GGT are all involved in the binding of the gamma-glutamyl moiety. The structure of E. coli GGT presented here, together with sequence alignment of GGTs, may be applicable to interpret the biochemical and genetic data of other GGTs.
In eubacteria, termination of translation is signaled by any one of the stop codons UAA, UAG, and UGA moving into the ribosomal A site. Two release factors, RF1 and RF2, recognize and bind to the stop codons with different affinities and trigger the hydrolysis of the ester bond that links the polypeptide with the P-site tRNA. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) results obtained in this study show that ribosome-bound RF1 is in an open conformation, unlike the closed conformation observed in the crystal structure of the free factor, allowing its simultaneous access to both the decoding center and the peptidyl-transferase center. These results are similar to those obtained for RF2, but there is an important difference in how the factors bind to protein L11, which forms part of the GTPase-associated center of the large ribosomal subunit. The difference in the binding position, C-terminal domain for RF2 versus N-terminal domain for RF1, explains a body of L11 mutation studies that revealed differential effects on the activity of the two factors. Very recent data obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering now reveal that the solution structure of RF1 is open, as here seen on the ribosome by cryo-EM, and not closed, as seen in the crystal.
The N-terminal acetyltransferase NatB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of the catalytic subunit Nat3p and the associated subunit Mdm20p. We here extend our present knowledge about the physiological role of NatB by a combined proteomics and phenomics approach. We found that strains deleted for either NAT3 or MDM20 displayed different growth rates and morphologies in specific stress conditions, demonstrating that the two NatB subunits have partly individual functions. Earlier reported phenotypes of the nat3Delta strain have been associated with altered functionality of actin cables. However, we found that point mutants of tropomyosin that suppress the actin cable defect observed in nat3Delta only partially restores wild-type growth and morphology, indicating the existence of functionally important acetylations unrelated to actin cable function. Predicted NatB substrates were dramatically overrepresented in a distinct set of biological processes, mainly related to DNA processing and cell cycle progression. Three of these proteins, Cac2p, Pac10p, and Swc7p, were identified as true NatB substrates. To identify N-terminal acetylations potentially important for protein function, we performed a large-scale comparative phenotypic analysis including nat3Delta and strains deleted for the putative NatB substrates involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA processing. By this procedure we predicted functional importance of the N-terminal acetylation for 31 proteins.
Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) (EC 2.3.2.5) catalyze the intramolecular cyclization of protein N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid with the concomitant liberation of ammonia. QCs may be classified in two groups containing, respectively, the mammalian enzymes, and the enzymes from plants, bacteria, and parasites. The crystal structure of the QC from the latex of Carica papaya (PQC) has been determined at 1.7A resolution. The structure was solved by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction technique using sulfur and zinc as anomalous scatterers. The enzyme folds into a five-bladed beta-propeller, with two additional alpha-helices and one beta hairpin. The propeller closure is achieved via an original molecular velcro, which links the last two blades into a large eight stranded beta-sheet. The zinc ion present in the PQC is bound via an octahedral coordination into an elongated cavity located along the pseudo 5-fold axis of the beta-propeller fold. This zinc ion presumably plays a structural role and may contribute to the exceptional stability of PQC, along with an extended hydrophobic packing, the absence of long loops, the three-joint molecular velcro and the overall folding itself. Multiple sequence alignments combined with structural analyses have allowed us to tentatively locate the active site, which is filled in the crystal structure either by a Tris molecule or an acetate ion. These analyses are further supported by the experimental evidence that Tris is a competitive inhibitor of PQC. The active site is located at the C-terminal entrance of the PQC central tunnel. W83, W110, W169, Q24, E69, N155, K225, F22 and F67 are highly conserved residues in the C-terminal entrance, and their putative role in catalysis is discussed. The PQC structure is representative of the plants, bacterial and parasite enzymes and contrasts with that of mammalian enzymes, that may possibly share a conserved scaffold of the bacterial aminopeptidase.
The structure of the ternary complex of mycothiol synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis with bound desacetylmycothiol and CoA was determined to 1.8 A resolution. The structure of the acetyl-CoA-binary complex had shown an active site groove that was several times larger than its substrate. The structure of the ternary complex reveals that mycothiol synthase undergoes a large conformational change in which the two acetyltransferase domains are brought together through shared interactions with the functional groups of desacetylmycothiol, thereby decreasing the size of this large central groove. A comparison of the binary and ternary structures illustrates many of the features that promote catalysis. Desacetylmycothiol is positioned with its primary amine in close proximity and in the proper orientation for direct nucleophilic attack on the si-face of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA. Glu-234 and Tyr-294 are positioned to act as a general base and general acid to promote acetyl transfer. In addition, this structure provides further evidence that the N-terminal acetyltransferase domain no longer has enzymatic activity and is vestigial in nature.
Human acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (hACAT1) esterifies cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We had previously reported that hACAT1 contains seven transmembrane domains (TMD) (Lin, S., Cheng, D., Liu, M. S., Chen, J., and Chang, T. Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 23276-23285) and nine cysteines. The Cys near the N-terminal is located at the cytoplasm; the two cysteines near the C-terminal form a disulfide bond and are located in the ER lumen. The other six free cysteines are located in buried region(s) of the enzyme (Guo, Z.-Y., Chang, C. C. Y., Lu, X., Chen, J., Li, B.-L., and Chang, T.-Y. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 6537-6548). In the current study, we show that the conserved His-460 is a key active site residue for hACAT1. We next performed Cys-scanning mutagenesis within the region of amino acids 354-493, expressed these mutants in Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking ACAT1, and prepared microsomes from transfected cells. The microsomes are either left intact or permeabilized with detergent. The accessibility of the engineered cysteines of microsomal hACAT1 to various maleimide derivatives, including mPEG(5000)-maleimide (large, hydrophilic, and membrane-impermeant), N-ethylmaleimide, 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (small, hydrophilic, and ER membrane-permeant), and N-phenylmaleimide (small, hydrophobic, and ER membrane-permeant), were monitored by Western blot analysis. The results led us to construct a revised, nine-TMD model, with the active site His-460 located within a hitherto undisclosed transmembrane domain, between Arg-443 and Tyr-462.
RimL is responsible for converting the prokaryotic ribosomal protein from L12 to L7 by acetylation of its N-terminal amino group. We demonstrate that purified RimL is capable of posttranslationally acetylating L12, exhibiting a V(max) of 21 min(-1). We have also determined the apostructure of RimL from Salmonella typhimurium and its complex with coenzyme A, revealing a homodimeric oligomer with structural similarity to other Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily members. A large central trough located at the dimer interface provides sufficient room to bind both L12 N-terminal helices. Structural and biochemical analysis indicates that RimL proceeds by single-step transfer rather than a covalent-enzyme intermediate. This is the first structure of a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase family member with demonstrated activity toward a protein N(alpha)-amino group and is a first step toward understanding the molecular basis for N(alpha)acetylation and its function in cellular regulation.
The two recently identified protein acyl transferases (PATs), Akr1p and Erf2p/Erf4p, point toward the DHHC protein family as a likely PAT family. The DHHC protein family, defined by the novel, zinc finger-like DHHC cysteine-rich domain (DHHC-CRD), is a diverse collection of polytopic membrane proteins extending through all eukaryotes. To define the PAT domains that are oriented to the cytoplasm and are thus available to effect the cytoplasmically limited palmitoyl modification, we have determined the transmembrane topology of the yeast PAT Akr1p. Portions of the yeast protein invertase (Suc2p) were inserted in-frame at 10 different hydrophilic sites within the Akr1 polypeptide. Three of the Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 insertion proteins were found to be extensively glycosylated, indicating that the invertase segment inserted at these Akr1p sites is luminally oriented. The remaining seven insertion proteins were not glycosylated, consistent with a cytoplasmic orientation for these sites. The results support a model in which the Akr1 polypeptide crosses the bilayer six times with the bulk of its hydrophilic domains disposed toward the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic domains include both the relatively large, ankyrin repeat-containing N-terminal domain and the DHHC-CRD, which maps to a cytosolic loop segment. Functionality of the different Akr1-Suc2-Akr1 proteins also was examined. Insertions at only 4 of the 10 sites were found to disrupt Akr1p function. Interestingly, these four sites all map cytoplasmically, suggesting key roles for these cytoplasmic domains in Akr1 PAT function. Finally, extrapolating from the Akr1p topology, topology models are proposed for other DHHC protein family members.
Polyomavirus large T antigen transactivates a variety of genes whose products are involved in S phase induction. These genes are regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors, which are under the control of the pocket protein retinoblastoma protein and its relatives p130 and p107. The viral protein causes a dissociation of E2F-pocket protein complexes that results in transactivation of the genes. This reaction requires the N-terminal binding site for pocket proteins and the J domain that binds chaperones. We found earlier that a mutation of the zinc finger located within the C-terminal domain, a region assumed to function mainly in the replication of viral DNA, also interferes with transactivation. Here we show that binding of the histone acetyltransferase coactivator complex CBP/p300-PCAF to the C terminus correlates with the ability of large T antigen to transactivate genes. This interaction results in promoter-specific acetylation of histones. Inactive mutant proteins with changes within the C-terminal domain were nevertheless able to dissociate the E2F pocket protein complexes, indicating that this dissociation is a necessary but insufficient step in the T antigen-induced transactivation of genes. It has to be accompanied by a second step involving the T antigen-mediated recruitment of a histone acetyltransferase complex.
CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, plays an important role as a general cointegrator of various signaling pathways and interacts with a large number of transcription factors. Interactions of CBP with ligand binding domains (LBDs) of nuclear receptors are mediated by LXXLL motifs, as are those of p160 proteins, although the number, distribution, and precise sequences of the motifs differ. We used a large N-terminal fragment of murine CBP to map by biochemical methods and NMR spectroscopy the interaction domain of CBP with the LBDs of several nuclear receptors. We show that distinct zones of that fragment are involved in the interactions: a 20-residue segment containing the LXXLL motif (residues 61-80) is implicated in the interaction with all three domains tested (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-LBD, retinoid X receptor alpha-LBD, and estrogen-related receptor gamma-LBD), whereas a second N-terminal well conserved block of around 25 residues centered on a consensus L(40)PDEL(44) motif constitutes a secondary motif of interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-LBD. Sequence analysis reveals that both zones are well conserved in all vertebrate p300/CBP proteins, suggesting their functional importance. Interactions of p300/CBP coactivators with the LBDs of nuclear receptors are not limited to the canonical LXXLL motifs, involving both a longer contiguous segment around the motif and, for certain domains, an additional zone.
N(alpha) acetylation is one of the most abundant protein modifications in eukaryotes and is catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). NatA, the major NAT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, consists of the subunits Nat1p, Ard1p, and Nat5p and is necessary for the assembly of repressive chromatin structures. Here, we found that Orc1p, the large subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), required NatA acetylation for its role in telomeric silencing. NatA functioned genetically through the ORC binding site of the HMR-E silencer. Furthermore, tethering Orc1p directly to the silencer circumvented the requirement for NatA in silencing. Orc1p was N(alpha) acetylated in vivo by NatA. Mutations that abrogated its ability to be acetylated caused strong telomeric derepression. Thus, N(alpha) acetylation of Orc1p represents a protein modification that modulates chromatin function in S. cerevisiae. Genetic evidence further supported a functional link between NatA and ORC: (i) nat1Delta was synthetically lethal with orc2-1 and (ii) the synthetic lethality between nat1Delta and SUM1-1 required the Orc1 N terminus. We also found Sir3p to be acetylated by NatA. In summary, we propose a model by which N(alpha) acetylation is required for the binding of silencing factors to the N terminus of Orc1p and Sir3p to recruit heterochromatic factors and establish repression.
RNase L inhibitors (RLIs) correspond to a group of soluble proteins from the large ATP binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. Structurally, RLIs have an N-terminal Fe-S domain and two nucleotide binding domains. Orthologous RLI sequences with more than 48% identity have been found from Archea to Eukaryota, but have not as yet been identified in Eubacteria. Some organisms, like Arabidopsis thaliana and human, have paralogous genes with differential expression patterns, the function of which remains to be determined. Expression of Arabidopsis RLI2 was slightly increased in transgenic plants showing RNA interference, suggesting a role in this pathway.
Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), which range in monomer size between 12 and 42 kDa, are characterized by a conserved C-terminal alpha-crystallin domain of 80-100 residues. They generally form large homo- or heteromeric complexes, and typically have in vitro chaperone-like activity, keeping unfolding proteins in solution. A special type of sHSP, with a duplicated alpha-crystallin domain, is present in parasitic flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Considering that an alpha-crystallin domain is essential for the oligomerization and chaperone-like properties of sHSPs, we characterized Tsp36 from the tapeworm Taenia saginata. Both wild-type Tsp36 and a mutant (Tsp36C--&gt;R) in which the single cysteine has been replaced by arginine were expressed and purified. Far-UV CD measurements of Tsp36 were in agreement with secondary structure predictions, which indicated alpha-helical structure in the N-terminal region and the expected beta-sandwich structure for the two alpha-crystallin domains. Gel permeation chromatography and nano-ESI-MS showed that wild type Tsp36 forms dimers in a reducing environment, and tetramers in a non-reducing environment. The tetramers are stabilized by disulfide bridges involving a large proportion of the Tsp36 monomers. Tsp36C--&gt;R exclusively occurs as dimers according to gel permeation chromatography, while the nondisulfide bonded fraction of wild type Tsp36 dissociates from tetramers into dimers under nonreducing conditions at increased temperature (43 degrees C). The tetrameric form of Tsp36 has a greater chaperone-like activity than the dimeric form.
The origin of germline-limited chromosomes (Ks) as descendants of somatic chromosomes (Ss) and their structural evolution was recently elucidated in the chironomid Acricotopus. The Ks consist of large S-homologous sections and of heterochromatic segments containing germline-specific, highly repetitive DNA sequences. Less is known about the molecular evolution and features of the sequences in the S-homologous K sections. More information about this was received by comparing homologous gene sequences of Ks and Ss. Genes for 5.8S, 18S, 28S, and 5S ribosomal RNA were choosen for the comparison and therefore isolated first by PCR from somatic DNA of Acricotopus and sequenced. Specific K DNA was collected by microdissection of monopolar moving K complements from differential gonial mitoses and was then amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide primer (DOP)-PCR. With the sequence data of the somatic rDNAs, the homologous 5.8S and 5S rDNA sequences were isolated by PCR from the DOP-PCR sequence pool of the Ks. In addition, a number of K DOP-PCR sequences were directly cloned and analysed. One K clone contained a section of a putative N-acetyltransferase gene. Compared with its homolog from the Ss, the sequence exhibited few nucleotide substitutions (99.2% sequence identity). The same was true for the 5.8S and 5S sequences from Ss and Ks (97.5%-100% identity). This supports the idea that the S-homologous K sequences may be conserved and do not evolve independently from their somatic homologs. Possible mechanisms effecting such conservation of S-derived sequences in the Ks are discussed.
The Salmonella enterica chromosomally encoded AAC(6')-Iy has been shown to confer broad aminoglycoside resistance in strains in which the structural gene is expressed. The three-dimensional structures reported place the enzyme in the large Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily. The structure of the CoA-ribostamycin ternary complex allows us to propose a chemical mechanism for the reaction, and comparison with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis AAC(2')-CoA-ribostamycin complex allows us to define how regioselectivity of acetylation is achieved. The AAC(6')-Iy dimer is most structurally similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hpa2-encoded histone acetyltransferase. We demonstrate that AAC(6')-Iy catalyzes both acetyl-CoA-dependent self-alpha-N-acetylation and acetylation of eukaryotic histone proteins and the human histone H3 N-terminal peptide. These structural and catalytic similarities lead us to propose that chromosomally encoded bacterial acetyltransferases, including those functionally identified as aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, are the evolutionary progenitors of the eukaryotic histone acetyltransferases.
Two non-pathogenic scaffolds (represented by the filamentous bacteriophage fd and the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase E2 protein of the Bacillus stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex) able to deliver human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 antigenic determinants, were designed in our laboratories and investigated in controlled assay conditions. Based on a modification of the phage display technology, we developed an innovative concept for a safe and inexpensive vaccine in which conserved antigenic determinants of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RTase) were inserted into the N-terminal region of the major pVIII coat protein of bacteriophagefd virions. Analogously, we developed another antigen delivery system based on the E2 component from the PDH complex and capable of displaying large intact proteins on the surface of an icosahedral lattice. Our data show that both of these systems can deliver B and T epitopes to their respective presentation compartments in target cells and trigger a humoral response as well as a potent helper and cytolytic response in vitro and in vivo.
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that encodes two viral nucleocapsid proteins named small and large form hepatitis delta antigen (S-HDAg and L-HDAg). The S-HDAg is essential for viral RNA replication while the L-HDAg is required for viral assembly. In this study, we demonstrated that HDAg are acetylated proteins. Metabolic labeling with [(3)H]acetate revealed that both forms of HDAg could be acetylated in vivo. The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of cellular acetyltransferase p300 could acetylate the full-length and the N-terminal 88 amino acids of S-HDAg in vitro. By mass spectrometric analysis of the modified protein, Lys-72 of S-HDAg was identified as one of the acetylation sites. Substitution of Lys-72 to Arg caused the mutant S-HDAg to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The mutant reduced viral RNA accumulation and resulted in the earlier appearance of L-HDAg. These results demonstrated that HDAg is an acetylated protein and mutation of HDAg at Lys-72 modulates HDAg subcellular localization and may participate in viral RNA nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and replication.
The signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) gene family comprises seven members with similarities in their domain structure and a common mode of activation. Members of this gene family mediate interferon induction of gene transcription and the response to a large number of growth factors and hormones. Extracellular ligand binding to transmembrane receptors causes the intracellular activation of associated tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of Stat molecules, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus. Prolactin-induced phosphorylation of Stat5 is a key event in the development and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. In addition to the crucial phosphorylation at tyrosine 694, we have identified an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) as another secondary modification essential for the transcriptional induction by Stat5. This modification was only found on nuclear Stat5 after cytokine activation. Similar observations were made with Stat1, Stat3, and Stat6. Glycosylation of Stat5, however, does not seem to be a prerequisite for nuclear translocation. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed a glycosylated peptide in the N-terminal region of Stat5. Replacement of threonine 92 by an alanine residue (Stat5a-T92A) strongly reduced the prolactin induction of Stat5a glycosylation and abolished transactivation of a target gene promoter. Only the glycosylated form of Stat5 was able to bind the coactivator of transcription CBP, an essential interaction for Stat5-mediated gene transcription.
The majority of cytosolic proteins in eukaryotes contain a covalently linked acetyl moiety at their very N terminus. The mechanism by which the acetyl moiety is efficiently transferred to a large variety of nascent polypeptides is currently only poorly understood. Yeast N(alpha)-acetyltransferase NatA, consisting of the known subunits Nat1p and the catalytically active Ard1p, recognizes a wide range of sequences and is thought to act cotranslationally. We found that NatA was quantitatively bound to ribosomes via Nat1p and contained a previously unrecognized third subunit, the N(alpha)-acetyltransferase homologue Nat5p. Nat1p not only anchored Ard1p and Nat5p to the ribosome but also was in close proximity to nascent polypeptides, independent of whether they were substrates for N(alpha)-acetylation or not. Besides Nat1p, NAC (nascent polypeptide-associated complex) and the Hsp70 homologue Ssb1/2p interact with a variety of nascent polypeptides on the yeast ribosome. A direct comparison revealed that Nat1p required longer nascent polypeptides for interaction than NAC and Ssb1/2p. Delta nat1 or Delta ard1 deletion strains were temperature sensitive and showed derepression of silent mating type loci while Delta nat5 did not display any obvious phenotype. Temperature sensitivity and derepression of silent mating type loci caused by Delta nat1 or Delta ard1 were partially suppressed by overexpression of SSB1. The combination of data suggests that Nat1p presents the N termini of nascent polypeptides for acetylation and might serve additional roles during protein synthesis.
The estrogen receptor (ER) is a member of a large superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulates the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes. Several recent studies have demonstrated that XBP-1 mRNA expression is associated with ERalpha status in breast tumors. However, the role of XBP-1 in ERalpha signaling remains to be elucidated. More recently, two forms of XBP-1 were identified due to its unconventional splicing. We refer to the spliced and unspliced forms of XBP-1 as XBP-1S and XBP-1U, respectively. Here, we report that XBP-1S and XBP-1U enhanced ERalpha-dependent transcriptional activity in a ligand-independent manner. XBP-1S had stronger activity than XBP-1U. The maximal effects of XBP-1S and XBP-1U on ERalpha transactivation were observed when they were co-expressed with full-length ERalpha. SRC-1, the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family member, synergized with XBP-1S or XBP-1U to potentiate ERalpha activity. XBP-1S and XBP-1U bound to the ERalpha both in vitro and in vivo in a ligand-independent fashion. XBP-1S and XBP-1U interacted with the ERalpha region containing the DNA-binding domain. The ERalpha-interacting regions on XBP-1S and XBP-1U have been mapped to two regions, including the N-terminal basic region leucine zipper domain (bZIP) and the C-terminal activation domain. The bZIP-deleted mutants of XBP-1S and XBP-1U completely abolished ERalpha transactivation by XBP-1S and XBP-1U. These findings suggest that XBP-1S and XBP-1U may directly modulate ERalpha signaling in both the absence and presence of estrogen and, therefore, may play important roles in the proliferation of normal and malignant estrogen-regulated tissues.
An important attribute of proteome analysis carried out with the aid of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is that post-translational modifications of proteins can often be revealed. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has been made possible with the availability of its genome sequence. Here, we bring together observations on the proteins specifically associated with biosynthesis of the isochromanequinone polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin. The predicted products of 14 of the genes annotated as belonging to the act gene cluster were detected. They were generally present only in stationary phase cultures. Plausible explanations are presented for the absence of the other nine. For six of the gene products detected, there was evidence of either specific processing or covalent modification; in the case of the pyran ring closure enzyme ActVI-ORF3, the cleavage of the N-terminal 31 or 34 amino acids was previously shown to be associated with an extracytoplasmic location for the mature gene product. These observations may have implications for the regulation of actinorhodin biosynthesis, and for biochemical studies of artificially expressed Act proteins.
The N-terminal domain (NTD) of steroid receptors harbors a transcriptional activation function (AF1) that is composed of an intrinsically disordered polypeptide. We examined the interaction of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with the NTD of the progesterone receptor (PR) and its ability to regulate AF1 activity through coupled folding and binding. As assessed by solution phase biophysical methods, the isolated NTD of PR contains a large content of random coil, and it is capable of adopting secondary α-helical structure and more stable tertiary folding either in the presence of the natural osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide or through a direct interaction with TBP. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry confirmed the highly dynamic intrinsically disordered property of the NTD within the context of full-length PR. Deletion mapping and point mutagenesis defined a region of the NTD (amino acids 350-428) required for structural folding in response to TBP interaction. Overexpression of TBP in cells enhanced transcriptional activity mediated by the PR NTD, and deletion mutations showed that a region (amino acids 327-428), similar to that required for TBP-induced folding, was required for functional response. TBP also increased steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC-1) interaction with the PR NTD and cooperated with SRC-1 to stimulate NTD-dependent transcriptional activity. These data suggest that TBP can mediate structural reorganization of the NTD to facilitate the binding of co-activators required for maximal transcriptional activation. 
Chimeric protein toxins that act selectively on cells expressing a designated receptor may serve as investigational probes and/or antitumor agents. Here, we report use of the enzyme sortase A (SrtA) to create four chimeric toxins designed to selectively kill cells bearing the tumor marker HER2. We first expressed and purified: (i) a receptor recognition-deficient form of diphtheria toxin that lacks its receptor-binding domain and (ii) a mutated, receptor-binding-deficient form of anthrax-protective antigen. Both proteins carried at the C terminus the sortase recognition sequence LPETGG and a H₆ affinity tag. Each toxin protein was mixed with SrtA plus either of two HER2-recognition proteins--a single-chain antibody fragment or an Affibody--both carrying an N-terminal G₅ tag. With wild-type SrtA, the fusion reaction between the toxin and receptor-recognition proteins approached completion only after several hours, whereas with an evolved form of the enzyme, SrtA*, the reaction was virtually complete within 5 minutes. The four fusion toxins were purified and shown to kill HER2-positive cells in culture with high specificity. Sortase-mediated ligation of binary combinations of diverse natively folded proteins offers a facile way to produce large sets of chimeric proteins for research and medicine.
The BCL6 transcriptional repressor is required for the development of germinal center (GC) B cells and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Although BCL6 can recruit multiple corepressors, its transcriptional repression mechanism of action in normal and malignant B cells is unknown. We find that in B cells, BCL6 mostly functions through two independent mechanisms that are collectively essential to GC formation and DLBCL, both mediated through its N-terminal BTB domain. These are (1) the formation of a unique ternary BCOR-SMRT complex at promoters, with each corepressor binding to symmetrical sites on BCL6 homodimers linked to specific epigenetic chromatin features, and (2) the "toggling" of active enhancers to a poised but not erased conformation through SMRT-dependent H3K27 deacetylation, which is mediated by HDAC3 and opposed by p300 histone acetyltransferase. Dynamic toggling of enhancers provides a basis for B cells to undergo rapid transcriptional and phenotypic changes in response to signaling or environmental cues.
Cohesin's Smc1 and Smc3 subunits form V-shaped heterodimers, the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of which bind the C- and N-terminal domains, respectively, of the α-kleisin subunit, forming a large tripartite ring within in which sister DNAs are entrapped, and thereby held together (sister chromatid cohesion). During replication, establishment of stable cohesion is dependent on Eco1-mediated acetylation of Smc3's NBD, which is thought to prevent dissociation of α-kleisin from Smc3, thereby locking shut a "DNA exit gate." How Scc3 and Pds5, regulatory subunits bound to α-kleisin, regulate cohesion establishment and maintenance is poorly understood. We show here that by binding to α-kleisin adjacent to its Smc3 nucleotide binding N-terminal domain, Pds5 not only promotes cohesin's release from chromatin but also mediates de novo acetylation of Smc3 by Eco1 during S phase and subsequently prevents de-acetylation by the deacetylase Hos1/HDAC8. By first promoting cohesin's release from chromosomes and subsequently creating and guarding the chemical modification responsible for blocking release, Pds5 enables chromosomal cohesin to switch during S phase from a state of high turnover to one capable of tenaciously holding sister chromatids together for extended periods of time, a duality that has hitherto complicated analysis of this versatile cohesin subunit. 
During HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of rat submandibular saliva secreted under isoprenaline stimulation, a protein with an experimental [M+H](1+) = 10,544.24 m/z was detected (17.5 ± 0.7 min). The MS/MS fragmentation pattern, manually investigated, allowed establishing an internal sequence in agreement with a DNA-derived sequence of an unknown rat protein coded D3Z9M3 (Swiss-Prot). To match the experimental MS/MS fragmentation pattern and protein mass with theoretical data, the removal from the N terminus of the signal peptide and from the C terminus of three amino acid (a.a.) residues (Arg-Ala-Val) and the cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine in pyroglutamic had to be supposed, resulting in a mature protein of 90 a.a. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS of the trypsin digest ensured 100% sequence coverage. For the high glutamine content (34/90 = 37.8%) we propose to name this protein rat gliadoralin A 1-90. Low amounts of five different isoforms were sporadically detected, which did not significantly change their relative amounts after stimulation. Gliadoralin A is substrate for transglutaminase-2, having Lys 60 and different Gln residues as major determinants for enzyme recognition. In silico investigation of superior structures evidenced that a small part of the protein adopts an α-helical fold, whereas large segments are unfolded, suggesting an unordered conformation.
Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development and progression of chronic diabetic complications. Diabetes causes mitochondrial superoxide overproduction in the endothelial cells of both large and small vessels. This increased superoxide production causes the activation of several signal pathways involved in the pathogenesis of chronic complications. In particular, endothelial cells are major targets of glucose-induced oxidative damage in the target organs. Oxidative stress activates cellular signaling pathways and transcription factors in endothelial cells including protein kinase C (PKC), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), forkhead box O (FOXO), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). Oxidative stress also causes DNA damage and activates DNA nucleotide excision repair enzymes including the excision repair cross complimenting 1(ERCC1), ERCC4, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Augmented production of histone acetyltransferase p300, and alterations of histone deacetylases, including class III deacetylases sirtuins, are also involved in this process. Recent research has found that small noncoding RNAs, like microRNA, are a new kind of regulator associated with chronic diabetic complications. There are extensive and complicated interactions and among these molecules. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the role of oxidative stress in the development of diabetic complications in relation to epigenetic changes such as acetylation and microRNA alterations.
Endophilin N-BAR (N-terminal helix and Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain tubulates and vesiculates lipid membranes in vitro via its crescent-shaped dimer and four amphipathic helices that penetrate into membranes as wedges. Like F-BAR domains, endophilin N-BAR also forms a scaffold on membrane tubes. Unlike F-BARs, endophilin N-BARs have N-terminal H0 amphipathic helices that are proposed to interact with other N-BARs in oligomer lattices. Recent cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions shed light on the organization of the N-BAR lattice coats on a nanometer scale. However, because of the resolution of the reconstructions, the precise positioning of the amphipathic helices is still ambiguous. In this work, we applied a coarse-grained model to study various membrane remodeling scenarios induced by endophilin N-BARs. We found that H0 helices of N-BARs prefer to align in an antiparallel manner at two ends of the protein to form a stable lattice. The deletion of H0 helices causes disruption of the lattice. In addition, we analyzed the persistence lengths of the protein-coated tubes and found that the stiffness of endophilin N-BAR-coated tubules qualitatively agrees with previous experimental work studying N-BAR-coated tubules. Large-scale simulations on membrane liposomes revealed a systematic relation between H0 helix density and local membrane curvature fluctuations. The data also suggest that the H0 helix is required for BARs to form organized structures on the liposome, further illustrating its important function.
Endophilin is a key protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Previous computational and experimental work suggested that the N-terminal helix is embedded into the membrane to induce curvature; however, the role of the SH3 domain remains controversial. To address this issue, we performed computer simulations of the endophilin dimer in solution to understand the interaction between the N-BAR and SH3 domains and its effect on biological function. We predict that the helix binds to the SH3 domain through hydrophobic and salt-bridge interactions. This protects the hydrophobic residues on both domains and keeps the SH3 domain near the end of the N-BAR domain, in agreement with previous experimental results. The complex has a binding strength similar to a few hydrogen bonds (13.0 ± 0.6 kcal/mol), and the SH3 domain stabilizes the structure of the N-terminal helix in solution. Electrostatic calculations show a large region of strongly positive electrostatic potential near the N-terminal that can orient the helix toward the membrane and likely embed the helix into the membrane surface. This predicted mechanism suggests that endophilin can select for both curvature and electrostatic potential when interacting with membranes, highlighting the importance of the SH3 domain in regulating the function of endophilin.
Apicomplexans are obligate intracellular parasites that actively penetrate their host cells to create an intracellular niche for replication. Commitment to invasion is thought to be mediated by the rhoptries, specialized apical secretory organelles that inject a protein complex into the host cell to form a tight-junction for parasite entry. Little is known about the molecular factors that govern rhoptry biogenesis, their subcellular organization at the apical end of the parasite and subsequent release of this organelle during invasion. We have identified a Toxoplasma palmitoyl acyltransferase, TgDHHC7, which localizes to the rhoptries. Strikingly, conditional knockdown of TgDHHC7 results in dispersed rhoptries that fail to organize at the apical end of the parasite and are instead scattered throughout the cell. While the morphology and content of these rhoptries appears normal, failure to tether at the apex results in a complete block in host cell invasion. In contrast, attachment and egress are unaffected in the knockdown, demonstrating that the rhoptries are not required for these processes. We show that rhoptry targeting of TgDHHC7 requires a short, highly conserved C-terminal region while a large, divergent N-terminal domain is dispensable for both targeting and function. Additionally, a point mutant lacking a key residue predicted to be critical for enzyme activity fails to rescue apical rhoptry tethering, strongly suggesting that tethering of the organelle is dependent upon TgDHHC7 palmitoylation activity. We tie the importance of this activity to the palmitoylated Armadillo Repeats-Only (TgARO) rhoptry protein by showing that conditional knockdown of TgARO recapitulates the dispersed rhoptry phenotype of TgDHHC7 knockdown. The unexpected finding that apicomplexans have exploited protein palmitoylation for apical organelle tethering yields new insight into the biogenesis and function of rhoptries and may provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention against Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan parasites.
Lysine acetylation is a post-translational modification that is important for the regulation of metabolism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In bacteria, the best studied protein acetyltransferase is Pat. In the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, at least 10 AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase enzymes are acetylated by the Pat homologue RpPat. All bona fide RpPat substrates contain the conserved motif PX(4)GK. Here, we show that the presence of such a motif is necessary but not sufficient for recognition by RpPat. RpPat failed to acetylate the methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase of this bacterium (hereafter RpMatB) in vivo and in vitro, despite the homology of RpMatB to known RpPat substrates. We used RpMatB to identify structural determinants that are recognized by RpPat. To do this, we constructed a series of RpMatB chimeras that became substrates of RpPat. In such chimeras, a short region (11-25 residues) of RpMatB located &gt;20 residues N-terminal to the acetylation site was replaced with the corresponding sequences from other AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases that were known RpPat substrates. Strikingly, the enzymatic activity of RpMatB chimeras was regulated by acetylation both in vitro and in vivo. Crystal structures of two of these chimeras showed that the major difference between them and wild-type RpMatB was within a loop region ∼23 Å from the acetylation site. On the basis of these results, we suggest that RpPat likely interacts with a relatively large surface of its substrates, in addition to the PX(4)GK motif, and that RpPat probably has relatively narrow substrate specificity.
PagP, a beta-barrel membrane protein found in Gram-negative bacteria, expresses robustly in inclusion bodies when its signal sequence is removed. We have developed a new fusion protein expression system based on PagP and demonstrated its utility in the expression of the unstructured N-terminal region of human cardiac troponin I (residues 1-71). A yield of 100mg fusion protein per liter M9 minimal media was obtained. The troponin I fragment was removed from PagP using cyanogen bromide cleavage at methionine residues followed by nickel affinity chromatography. We further demonstrate that optimal cleavage requires complete reduction of methionine residues prior to cyanogen bromide treatment, and this is effectively accomplished using potassium iodide under acidic conditions. The PagP-based fusion protein system is more effective at targeting proteins into inclusion bodies than a commercially available system that uses ketosteroid isomerase; it thus represents an important advance for producing large quantities of unfolded peptides or proteins in Escherichia coli.
Protein N-terminal acetylation by Nα-acetyltransferases (NATs) is an omnipresent protein modification that affects a large number of proteins. The exact biological role of N-terminal acetylation has, however, remained enigmatic for the overall majority of affected proteins, and only for a rather small number of proteins, N-terminal acetylation was linked to various protein features including stability, localization, and interactions. This minireview tries to summarize the recent progress made in understanding the functionality of N-terminal protein acetylation and also focuses on noncanonical functions of the NATs subunits.
Molecular functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), such as molecular recognition and cellular signaling, are ascribed to dynamic changes in the conformational space in response to binding of target molecules. Sortase, a transpeptitase in Gram-positive bacteria, has an IDR in a loop which undergoes a disordered-to-ordered transition (called "disordered loop"), accompanying a tilt of another loop ("dynamic loop"), upon binding of a signal peptide and a calcium ion. In this study, all-atom conformational ensembles of sortase were calculated for the four different binding states (with/without the peptide and with/without a calcium ion) by the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) simulation to examine how the binding of the peptide and/or calcium influences the conformational ensemble. The MSES is a multiscale and multicopy simulation method that allows an enhanced sampling of the all-atom model of large proteins including explicit solvent. A 100 ns MSES simulation of the ligand-free sortase using 20 replicas (in total 2 μs) demonstrated large flexibility in both the disordered and dynamic loops; however, their distributions were not random but had a clear preference which populates the N-terminal part of the disordered loop near the bound form. The MSES simulations of the three binding states clarified the allosteric mechanism of sortase: the N- and C-terminal parts of the disordered loop undergo a disorder-to-order transition independently of each other upon binding of the peptide and a calcium ion, respectively; however, upon binding of both ligands, the two parts work cooperatively to stabilize the bound peptide.
Functioning as key players in cellular regulation of membrane curvature, BAR domain proteins bend bilayers and recruit interaction partners through poorly understood mechanisms. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we present reconstructions of full-length endophilin and its N-terminal N-BAR domain in their membrane-bound state. Endophilin lattices expose large areas of membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners.
Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase from Bacillus pumilus KS12 (GGTBP) was cloned, expressed in pET-28-E. coli expression system as a heterodimeric enzyme with molecular weights of 45 and 20 kDa for large and small subunit, respectively. It was purified by nickel affinity chromatography with hydrolytic and transpeptidase activity of 1.82 U/mg and 4.35 U/mg, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that GGTBP was most closely related to Bacillus licheniformis GGT and had all the catalytic residues and nucleophiles for autoprocessing recognized from E. coli. It was optimally active at pH 8 and 60°C. It exhibited pH stability from pH 6-9 and high thermostability with t(1/2) of 15 min at 70°C. It had K(m), V(max) of 0.045 mM, 4.35 μmol/mg/min, respectively. Decoupling of autoprocessing by co-expressing large and small subunit in pET-Duet1-E. coli expression system yielded active enzyme with transpeptidase activity of 5.31 U/mg. Though N-terminal truncations of rGGTBP upto 95 aa did not affect autoprocessing of GGT however activity was lost with truncation beyond 63 aa.
Aminoglycoside (6') acetyltransferase-Ie/aminoglycoside (2″) phosphotransferase-Ia [AAC(6')-Ie/APH(2″)-Ia] is one of the most problematic aminoglycoside resistance factors in clinical pathogens, conferring resistance to almost every aminoglycoside antibiotic available to modern medicine. Despite 3 decades of research, our understanding of the structure of this bifunctional enzyme remains limited. We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to model the structure of this bifunctional enzyme in solution and to study the impact of substrate binding on the enzyme. It was observed that the enzyme adopts a rigid conformation in solution, where the N-terminal AAC domain is fixed to the C-terminal APH domain and not loosely tethered. The addition of acetyl-coenzyme A, coenzyme A, GDP, guanosine 5'-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (GMPPNP), and combinations thereof to the protein resulted in only modest changes to the radius of gyration (R(G)) of the enzyme, which were not consistent with any large changes in enzyme structure upon binding. These results imply some selective advantage to the bifunctional enzyme beyond coexpression as a single polypeptide, likely linked to an improvement in enzymatic properties. We propose that the rigid structure contributes to improved electrostatic steering of aminoglycoside substrates toward the two active sites, which may provide such an advantage.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model species of algae for studies on the circadian clock. Previously, we isolated a series of mutants showing defects in the circadian rhythm of a luciferase reporter introduced into the chloroplast genome, and identified the genes responsible for the defective circadian rhythm. However, we were unable to identify the gene responsible for the defective circadian rhythm of the rhythm of chloroplast 97 (roc97) mutant because of a large genomic deletion. Here, we identified the gene responsible for the roc97 mutation through a genetic complementation study. This gene encodes a protein that is homologous to the subunit of N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) which catalyzes N-terminal acetylation of proteins. Our results provide the first example of involvement of the protein N-terminal acetyltransferase in the circadian rhythm.
N-terminal modifications play a major role in the fate of proteins in terms of activity, stability, or subcellular compartmentalization. Such modifications remain poorly described and badly characterized in proteomic studies, and only a few comparison studies among organisms have been made available so far. Recent advances in the field now allow the enrichment and selection of N-terminal peptides in the course of proteome-wide mass spectrometry analyses. These targeted approaches unravel as a result the extent and nature of the protein N-terminal modifications. Here, we aimed at studying such modifications in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to compare these results with those obtained from a human sample analyzed in parallel. We applied large scale analysis to compile robust conclusions on both data sets. Our data show strong convergence of the characterized modifications especially for protein N-terminal methionine excision, co-translational N-α-acetylation, or N-myristoylation between animal and plant kingdoms. Because of the convergence of both the substrates and the N-α-acetylation machinery, it was possible to identify the N-acetyltransferases involved in such modifications for a small number of model plants. Finally, a high proportion of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins feature post-translational N-α-acetylation of the mature protein after removal of the transit peptide. Unlike animals, plants feature in a dedicated pathway for post-translational acetylation of organelle-targeted proteins. The corresponding machinery is yet to be discovered.
 The majority of the noncoding regions of mammalian genomes have been found to be transcribed to generate noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), resulting in intense interest in their biological roles. During the past decade, numerous ncRNAs and aptamers have been identified as regulators of transcription. 6S RNA, first described as a ncRNA in E. coli, mimics an open promoter structure, which has a large bulge with two hairpin/stalk structures that regulate transcription through interactions with RNA polymerase. B2 RNA, which has stem-loops and unstructured single-stranded regions, represses transcription of mRNA in response to various stresses, including heat shock in mouse cells. The interaction of TLS (translocated in liposarcoma) with CBP/p300 was induced by ncRNAs that bind to TLS, and this in turn results in inhibition of CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity in human cells. Transcription regulator EWS (Ewing's sarcoma), which is highly related to TLS, and TLS specifically bind to G-quadruplex structures in vitro. The carboxy terminus containing the Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeat domains in these proteins are necessary for cis-repression of transcription activation and HAT activity by the N-terminal glutamine-rich domain. Especially, the RGG domain in the carboxy terminus of EWS is important for the G-quadruplex specific binding. Together, these data suggest that functions of EWS and TLS are modulated by specific structures of ncRNAs.
Ether glycerolipids of Leishmania major are important membrane components as well as building blocks of various virulence factors. In L. major, the first enzyme of the ether glycerolipid biosynthetic pathway, LmDAT, is an unusual, glycosomal dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase important for parasite's growth and survival during the stationary phase, synthesis of ether lipids, and virulence. The present work extends our knowledge of this important biosynthetic enzyme in parasite biology. Site-directed mutagenesis of LmDAT demonstrated that an active enzyme was critical for normal growth and survival during the stationary phase. Deletion analyses showed that the large N-terminal extension of this initial acyltransferase may be important for its stability or activity. Further, abrogation of the C-terminal glycosomal targeting signal sequence of LmDAT led to extraglycosomal localization, did not impair its enzymatic activity but affected synthesis of the ether glycerolipid-based virulence factor lipophosphoglycan. In addition, expression of this recombinant form of LmDAT in a null mutant of LmDAT did not restore normal growth and survival during the stationary phase. These results emphasize the importance of this enzyme's compartmentalization in the glycosome for the generation of lipophosphoglycan and parasite's biology.
SsfX3 is a GDSL family acyltransferase that transfers salicylate to the C-4 hydroxyl of a tetracycline intermediate in the penultimate step during biosynthesis of the anticancer natural product SF2575. The C-4 salicylate takes the place of the more common C-4 dimethylamine functionality, making SsfX3 the first acyltransferase identified to act on a tetracycline substrate. The crystal structure of SsfX3 was determined at 2.5 Å, revealing two distinct domains as follows: an N-terminal β-sandwich domain that resembles a carbohydrate-binding module, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that contains the atypical α/β-hydrolase fold found in the GDSL hydrolase family of enzymes. The active site lies at one end of a large open binding pocket, which is spatially defined by structural elements from both the N- and C-terminal domains. Mutational analysis in the putative substrate binding pocket identified residues from both domains that are important for binding the acyl donor and acceptor. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module-like domain rendered the stand-alone α/β-hydrolase domain inactive. The additional noncatalytic module is therefore proposed to be required to define the binding pocket and provide sufficient interactions with the spatially extended tetracyclic substrate. SsfX3 was also demonstrated to accept a variety of non-native acyl groups. This relaxed substrate specificity toward the acyl donor allowed the chemoenzymatic biosynthesis of C-4-modified analogs of the immediate precursor to the bioactive SF2575; these were used to assay the structure activity relationships at the C-4 position.
The precise mechanism by which glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates the transcription of its target genes is largely unknown. This is, in part, due to the lack of structural and functional information about GR's N-terminal activation function domain, AF1. Like many steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), the GR AF1 exists in an intrinsically disordered (ID) conformation or an ensemble of conformers that collectively appears to be unstructured. The GR AF1 is known to recruit several coregulatory proteins, including those from the basal transcriptional machinery, e.g., TATA box binding protein (TBP) that forms the basis for the multiprotein transcription initiation complex. However, the precise mechanism of this process is unknown. We have earlier shown that conditional folding of the GR AF1 is the key for its interactions with critical coactivator proteins. We hypothesize that binding of TBP to AF1 results in the structural rearrangement of the ID AF1 domain such that its surfaces become easily accessible for interaction with other coactivators. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether TBP binding-induced structure formation in the GR AF1 facilitates its interaction with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), a critical coactivator that is important for GR-mediated transcriptional activity. Our data show that stoichiometric binding of TBP induces significantly higher helical content at the expense of random coil configuration in the GR AF1. Further, we found that this induced AF1 conformation facilitates its interaction with SRC-1, and subsequent AF1-mediated transcriptional activity. Our results may provide a potential mechanism through which GR and by large other SHRs may regulate the expression of the GR-target genes.
Thymosin α1 (Tα1), a 28-amino acid Nα-acetylated peptide, has a powerful general immunostimulating activity. Although biosynthesis is an attractive means of large-scale manufacture, to date, Tα1 can only be chemosynthesized because of two obstacles to its biosynthesis: the difficulties in expressing small peptides and obtaining Nα-acetylation. In this study, we describe a novel production process for Nα-acetylated Tα1 in Escherichia coli.
To obtain recombinant Nα-acetylated Tα1 efficiently, a fusion protein, Tα1-Intein, was constructed, in which Tα1 was fused to the N-terminus of the smallest mini-intein, Spl DnaX (136 amino acids long, from Spirulina platensis), and a His tag was added at the C-terminus. Because Tα1 was placed at the N-terminus of the Tα1-Intein fusion protein, Tα1 could be fully acetylated when the Tα1-Intein fusion protein was co-expressed with RimJ (a known prokaryotic Nα-acetyltransferase) in Escherichia coli. After purification by Ni-Sepharose affinity chromatography, the Tα1-Intein fusion protein was induced by the thiols β-mercaptoethanol or d,l-dithiothreitol, or by increasing the temperature, to release Tα1 through intein-mediated N-terminal cleavage. Under the optimal conditions, more than 90% of the Tα1-Intein fusion protein was thiolyzed, and 24.5 mg Tα1 was obtained from 1 L of culture media. The purity was 98% after a series of chromatographic purification steps. The molecular weight of recombinant Tα1 was determined to be 3107.44 Da by mass spectrometry, which was nearly identical to that of the synthetic version (3107.42 Da). The whole sequence of recombinant Tα1 was identified by tandem mass spectrometry and its N-terminal serine residue was shown to be acetylated.
The present data demonstrate that Nα-acetylated Tα1 can be efficiently produced in recombinant E. coli. This bioprocess could be used as an alternative to chemosynthesis for the production of Tα1. The described methodologies may also be helpful for the biosynthesis of similar peptides.
Cysteine (Cys) plays a major role in growth and survival of the human parasite Entamoeba histolytica. We report here the crystal structure of serine acetyltransferase (SAT) isoform 1, a cysteine biosynthetic pathway enzyme from E. histolytica (EhSAT1) at 1.77 Å, in complex with its substrate serine (Ser) at 1.59 Å and inhibitor Cys at 1.78 Å resolution. EhSAT1 exists as a trimer both in solution as well as in crystal structure, unlike hexamers formed by other known SATs. The difference in oligomeric state is due to the N-terminal region of the EhSAT1, which has very low sequence similarity to known structures, also differs in orientation and charge distribution. The Ser and Cys bind to the same site, confirming that Cys is a competitive inhibitor of Ser. The disordered C-terminal region and the loop near the active site are responsible for solvent-accessible acetyl-CoA binding site and, thus, lose inhibition to acetyl-CoA by the feedback inhibitor Cys. Docking and fluorescence studies show that EhSAT1 C-terminal-mimicking peptides can bind to O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (EhOASS), whereas native C-terminal peptide does not show any binding. To test further, C-terminal end of EhSAT1 was mutated and found that it inhibits EhOASS, confirming modified EhSAT1 can bind to EhOASS. The apparent inability of EhSAT1 to form a hexamer and differences in the C-terminal region are likely to be the major reasons for the lack of formation of the large cysteine synthase complex and loss of a complex regulatory mechanism in E. histolytica.
Numerous studies suggest that the majority of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides deposited in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are truncated and post-translationally modified at the N terminus. Among these modified species, pyroglutamyl-Aβ (pE-Aβ, including N3pE-Aβ40/42 and N11pE-Aβ40/42) has been identified as particularly neurotoxic. The N-terminal modification renders the peptide hydrophobic, accelerates formation of oligomers, and reduces degradation by peptidases, leading ultimately to the accumulation of the peptide and progression of AD. It has been shown that the formation of pyroglutamyl residues is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclase (QC). Here, we present data about the pharmacological in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the QC inhibitor (S)-1-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-5-yl)-5-(4-propoxyphenyl)imidazolidin-2-one (PQ912), the first-in-class compound that is in clinical development. PQ912 inhibits human, rat, and mouse QC activity, with Ki values ranging between 20 and 65 nM. Chronic oral treatment of hAPPSLxhQC double-transgenic mice with approximately 200 mg/kg/day via chow shows a significant reduction of pE-Aβ levels and concomitant improvement of spatial learning in a Morris water maze test paradigm. This dose results in a brain and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of PQ912 which relates to a QC target occupancy of about 60%. Thus, we conclude that &gt;50% inhibition of QC activity in the brain leads to robust treatment effects. Secondary pharmacology experiments in mice indicate a fairly large potency difference for Aβ cyclization compared with cyclization of physiologic substrates, suggesting a robust therapeutic window in humans. This information constitutes an important translational guidance for predicting the therapeutic dose range in clinical studies with PQ912.
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays a central role in cellular metabolism and regulation. As a metabolite-channeling multi-enzyme complex it acts as a complete nanomachine due to its unique geometry and by coupling a cascade of catalytic reactions using 'swinging arms'. Mammalian and specifically human PDC (hPDC) is assembled from multiple copies of E1 and E3 bound to a large E2/E3BP 60-meric core. A less restrictive and smaller catalytic core, which is still active, is highly desired for both fundamental research on channeling mechanisms and also to create a basis for further modification and engineering of new enzyme cascades. Here, we present the first experimental results of the successful disintegration of the E2/E3BP core while retaining its activity. This was achieved by C-terminal α-helixes double truncations (eight residues from E2 and seven residues from E3BP). Disintegration of the hPDC core via double truncations led to the formation of highly active (approximately 70% of wildtype) apparently unordered clusters or agglomerates and inactive non-agglomerated species (hexamer/trimer). After additional deletion of N-terminal 'swinging arms', the aforementioned C-terminal truncations also caused the formation of agglomerates of minimized E2/E3BP complexes. It is likely that these 'swinging arm' regions are not solely responsible for the formation of the large agglomerates.
N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. The NatC complex represents one of three major NATs of which the substrate profile remains largely unexplored. Here, we defined the in vivo human NatC Nt-acetylome on a proteome-wide scale by combining knockdown of its catalytic subunit Naa30 with positional proteomics. We identified 46 human NatC substrates, expanding our current knowledge on the substrate repertoire of NatC which now includes proteins harboring Met-Leu, Met-Ile, Met-Phe, Met-Trp, Met-Val, Met-Met, Met-His and Met-Lys N termini. Upon Naa30 depletion the expression levels of several organellar proteins were found reduced, in particular mitochondrial proteins, some of which were found to be NatC substrates. Interestingly, knockdown of Naa30 induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and fragmentation of mitochondria. In conclusion, NatC Nt-acetylates a large variety of proteins and is essential for mitochondrial integrity and function.
Many species of Gram-positive bacteria use sortase enzymes to assemble long, proteinaceous pili structures that project from the cell surface to mediate microbial adhesion. Sortases construct highly stable structures by catalyzing a transpeptidation reaction that covalently links pilin subunits together via isopeptide bonds. Most Gram-positive pili are assembled by class C sortases that contain a "lid", a structurally unique N-terminal extension that occludes the active site. It has been hypothesized that the "lid" in many sortases is mobile and thus capable of readily being displaced from the enzyme to facilitate substrate binding. Here, we show using NMR dynamics measurements, in vitro assays, and molecular dynamics simulations that the lid in the class C sortase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SrtC1) adopts a rigid conformation in solution that is devoid of large magnitude conformational excursions that occur on mechanistically relevant time scales. Additionally, we show that point mutations in the lid induce dynamic behavior that correlates with increased hydrolytic activity and sorting signal substrate access to the active site cysteine residue. These results suggest that the lid of the S. pneumoniae SrtC1 enzyme has a negative regulatory function and imply that a significant energetic barrier must be surmounted by currently unidentified factors to dislodge it from the active site to initiate pilus biogenesis.
Thymosin β4 is a 43 amino acid long peptide with an acetylated N-terminal serin that has a high potential as a remedy for healing ulcers, wounds and burns. Although protein biosynthesis offers attractive opportunities in terms of a large-scale production, currently thymosin β4 is mainly produced by chemical synthesis. The problems that hinder the successful commercialization of the biotechnological approach are associated with the small peptides expression and N-terminal acetylation. This work presents an innovative biotechnological method for thymosin β4 production that employs the peptide acetylation in vivo. A genetically engineered construct was created, where the Tβ4 coding sequence fused with the intein Mxe GyrA sequence and chitin-binding domain was combined with the acetyltransferase coding sequence to form a polycistronic construct under a stringent control of T7 promoter. This plasmid construct provided for the expression of the Tβ4-intein fusion protein. In the process of the post-translational modification in vivo formyl methionine was completely removed from the target peptide N-terminus and followed by the Tβ4 precursor N-terminal acetylation. The use of the intein-mediated expression system made it possible to extract thymosin β4 in only 2 chromatographic runs. The method is straightforward to implement and scale up. 
The GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases family (GNAT) is an important family of proteins that includes more than 100000 members among eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Acetylation appears as a major regulatory post-translational modification and is as widespread as phosphorylation. N-Acetyltransferases transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to a large array of substrates, from small molecules such as aminoglycoside antibiotics to macromolecules. Acetylation of proteins can occur at two different positions, either at the amino-terminal end (αN-acetylation) or at the ε-amino group (εN-acetylation) of an internal lysine residue. GNAT members have been classified into different groups on the basis of their substrate specificity, and in spite of a very low primary sequence identity, GNAT proteins display a common and conserved fold. This Current Topic reviews the different classes of bacterial GNAT proteins, their functions, their structural characteristics, and their mechanism of action. 
The incorporation of CENP-A into centromeric chromatin is an essential prerequisite for kinetochore formation. Yet, the molecular mechanisms governing this process are surprisingly divergent in different organisms. While CENP-A loading mechanisms have been studied in some detail in mammals, there are still large gaps to our understanding of CENP-A/Cid loading pathways in Drosophila. Here, we report on the characterization and delineation of at least three different CENP-A preloading complexes in Drosophila. Two complexes contain the CENP-A chaperones CAL1, FACT and/or Caf1/Rbap48. Notably, we identified a novel complex consisting of the histone acetyltransferase Hat1, Caf1 and CENP-A/H4. We show that Hat1 is required for proper CENP-A loading into chromatin, since knock-down in S2 cells leads to reduced incorporation of newly synthesized CENP-A. In addition, we demonstrate that CENP-A/Cid interacts with the HAT1 complex via an N-terminal region, which is acetylated in cytoplasmic but not in nuclear CENP-A. Since Hat1 is not responsible for acetylation of CENP-A/Cid, these results suggest a histone acetyltransferase activity-independent escort function for Hat1. Thus, our results point toward intriguing analogies between the complex processing pathways of newly synthesized CENP-A and canonical histones. 
K(Ca) 1.1 regulates smooth muscle contractility by modulating membrane potential, and age-associated changes in K(Ca) 1.1 expression may contribute to the development of motility disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Sphingolipids (SLs) are important structural components of cellular membranes whose altered composition may affect K(Ca) 1.1 expression. Thus, in this study, we examined whether altered SL composition due to aging may affect the contractility of gastric smooth muscle (GSM). We studied changes in ceramide synthases (CerS) and SL levels in the GSM of mice of varying ages and compared them with those in young CerS2-null mice. The levels of C16- and C18-ceramides, sphinganine, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate were increased, and levels of C22, C24:1 and C24 ceramides were decreased in the GSM of both aged wild-type and young CerS2-null mice. The altered SL composition upregulated K(Ca) 1.1 and increased K(Ca) 1.1 currents, while no change was observed in K(Ca) 1.1 channel activity. The upregulation of KC a 1.1 impaired intracellular Ca²⁺mobilization and decreased phosphorylated myosin light chain levels, causing GSM contractile dysfunction. Additionally, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase Cζ , c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and nuclear factor kappa-B were found to be involved in K(Ca) 1.1 upregulation. Our findings suggest that age-associated changes in SL composition or CerS2 ablation upregulate K(Ca) 1.1 via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase Cζ /c-Jun N-terminal kinases/nuclear factor kappa-B-mediated pathway and impair Ca²⁺ mobilization, which thereby induces the contractile dysfunction of GSM. CerS2-null mice exhibited similar effects to aged wild-type mice; therefore, CerS2-null mouse models may be utilized for investigating the pathogenesis of aging-associated motility disorders.
Peptide cyclization, a pivotal approach to modifying linear precursors of proteins and pepticles, has been used to enhance their biological activities and serum stabilities. Recently, sortase A (SrtA) from Staphyloccus aureus becomes a promising new technology for efficiently incorporating site specific modifications into proteins, conjugating the cell surface and cyclizing the linear peptides. In this study, we constructed two recombinant expression systems, one with chitin binding domain and the other with six-histidine tag and chitin binding domain on the N-terminal of SrtA, separately. The results of enzymatic kinetics indicate that the two recombinant tags do not impair the transpeptidase activity of SrtA compared with the standard reaction reported under the same reaction condition. The two synthesized peptides with N-ternimal three glycines and C-terminal penta-amino acid motif, LPETG, were cyclized using immobilized and recycled SrtA. The SrtA-based cyclization promises to represent a simple method for easy and efficient enzymatic synthesis of large cyclic peptides.
Discovered more than 50 years ago, N-terminal acetylation (N-Ac) is one of the most common protein modifications. Catalyzed by different N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), N-Ac was originally believed to mostly promote protein stability. However, several functional consequences at substrate level were recently described that yielded important new insights about the distinct molecular functions for this modification. The ubiquitous and apparent irreversible nature of this protein modification leads to the assumption that N-Ac mostly executes constitutive functions. In spite of the large number of substrates for each NAT, recent studies in multicellular organisms have nevertheless indicated very specific phenotypes after NAT loss. This raises the hypothesis that in vivo N-Ac is only functionally rate limiting for a small subset of substrates. In this review, we will discuss the function of N-Ac in the context of a developing organism. We will propose that some rate limiting NAT substrates may be tissue-specific leading to differential functions of N-Ac during development of multicellular organisms. Moreover, we will also propose the existence of tissue and developmental-specific mechanisms that differentially regulate N-Ac. 
Phospholipids are synthesized at the inner leaflet of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane but have to be translocated to the outer leaflet to maintain membrane lipid bilayer composition and structure. Even though phospholipid flippases have been proposed to exist in bacteria, only one such protein, MprF, has been described. MprF is a large integral membrane protein found in several prokaryotic phyla, whose C terminus modifies phosphatidylglycerol (PG), the most common bacterial phospholipid, with lysine or alanine to modulate the membrane surface charge and, as a consequence, confer resistance to cationic antimicrobial agents such as daptomycin. In addition, MprF is a flippase for the resulting lipids, Lys-PG or Ala-PG. Here we demonstrate that the flippase activity resides in the N-terminal 6 to 8 transmembrane segments of the Staphylococcus aureus MprF and that several conserved, charged amino acids and a proline residue are crucial for flippase function. MprF protects S. aureus against the membrane-active antibiotic daptomycin only when both domains are present, but the two parts do not need to be covalently linked and can function in trans. The Lys-PG synthase and flippase domains were each found to homo-oligomerize and also to interact with each other, which illustrates how the two functional domains may act together. Moreover, full-length MprF proteins formed oligomers, indicating that MprF functions as a dimer or larger oligomer. Together our data reveal how bacterial phospholipid flippases may function in the context of lipid biosynthetic processes.
Bacterial cytoplasmic membranes are crucial for maintaining and protecting cellular integrity. For instance, they have to cope with membrane-damaging agents such as cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) produced by competing bacteria (bacteriocins), secreted by eukaryotic host cells (defensins), or used as antimicrobial therapy (daptomycin). The MprF protein is found in many Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and even archaeal commensals or pathogens and confers resistance to CAMPs by modifying anionic phospholipids with amino acids, thereby compromising the membrane interaction of CAMPs. Here we describe how MprF does not only modify phospholipids but uses an additional, distinct domain for translocating the resulting lysinylated phospholipids to the outer leaflet of the membrane. We reveal critical details for the structure and function of MprF, the first dedicated prokaryotic phospholipid flippase, which may pave the way for targeting MprF with new antimicrobials that would not kill bacteria but sensitize them to antibiotics and innate host defense molecules.
To survive and persist within its human host, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum utilizes a battery of lineage-specific innovations to invade and multiply in human erythrocytes. With central roles in invasion and cytokinesis, the inner membrane complex, a Golgi-derived double membrane structure underlying the plasma membrane of the parasite, represents a unique and unifying structure characteristic to all organisms belonging to a large phylogenetic group called Alveolata. More than 30 structurally and phylogenetically distinct proteins are embedded in the IMC, where a portion of these proteins displays N-terminal acylation motifs. Although N-terminal myristoylation is catalyzed co-translationally within the cytoplasm of the parasite, palmitoylation takes place at membranes and is mediated by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs). Here, we identify a PAT (PfDHHC1) that is exclusively localized to the IMC. Systematic phylogenetic analysis of the alveolate PAT family reveals PfDHHC1 to be a member of a highly conserved, apicomplexan-specific clade of PATs. We show that during schizogony this enzyme has an identical distribution like two dual-acylated, IMC-localized proteins (PfISP1 and PfISP3). We used these proteins to probe into specific sequence requirements for IMC-specific membrane recruitment and their interaction with differentially localized PATs of the parasite. 
N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) is a cytosolic monomeric enzyme present in eukaryotes such as fungi and protozoa, but is not found in prokaryotes. The attachment of a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid, myristate, from myristoyl-CoA (14:0 CoA) to the N-terminal glycine residue in a specific set of cellular proteins is commonly called protein N-myristoylation. The myristoylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme myristoyl CoA:NMT is both necessary for the growth of various organisms and conclusive for cellular proliferation. Therefore, NMT has been identified as a novel and promising target for antifungal, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents, and a large number of potent NMT inhibitors with antifungal, antiparasitic, and anticancer activities have been reported. Herein we describe recent advances in the discovery of NMT inhibitors. We introduce not only the functions of NMT, but also some representative natural and synthetic inhibitors, with a focus on their biological activity, selectivity, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) information. In particular, inspiration from NMT inhibitor structures and the future direction of these compounds are highlighted.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae two alcohol acetyltransferases (AATases), Atf1 and Atf2, condense short chain alcohols with acetyl-CoA to produce volatile acetate esters. Such esters are, in large part, responsible for the distinctive flavors and aromas of fermented beverages including beer, wine, and sake. Atf1 and Atf2 localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Atf1 is known to localize to lipid droplets (LDs). The mechanism and function of these localizations are unknown. Here, we investigate potential mechanisms of Atf1 and Atf2 membrane association. Segments of the N- and C-terminal domains of Atf1 (residues 24-41 and 508-525, respectively) are predicted to be amphipathic helices. Truncations of these helices revealed that the terminal domains are essential for ER and LD association. Moreover, mutations of the basic or hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal helix and hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal helix disrupted ER association and subsequent sorting from the ER to LDs. Similar amphipathic helices are found at both ends of Atf2, enabling ER and LD association. As was the case with Atf1, mutations to the N- and C-terminal helices of Atf2 prevented membrane association. Sequence comparison of the AATases from Saccharomyces, non-Saccharomyces yeast (K. lactis and P. anomala) and fruits species (C. melo and S. lycopersicum) showed that only AATases from Saccharomyces evolved terminal amphipathic helices. Heterologous expression of these orthologs in S. cerevisiae revealed that the absence of terminal amphipathic helices eliminates LD association. Combined, the results of this study suggest a common mechanism of membrane association for AATases via dual N- and C-terminal amphipathic helices. 
The backbone assignment of medium-sized proteins is rarely as straightforward as that of small proteins, and thus often requires creative solutions. Here, we describe the application of a combination of standard 3D heteronuclear methods with CC(CO)NH and a variety of MUltiplicity Selective In-phase Coherence transfer (MUSIC) experiments. Both CC(CO)NH and MUSIC are, in theory, very powerful methods for the backbone assignment of proteins. Due to low sensitivity, their use has usually been linked to small proteins only. However, we found that combining CC(CO)NH and MUSIC experiments simplified the assignment of two challenging medium-sized proteins of 13 and 19.5 kDa, respectively. These methods are to some extent complementary to each other: CC(CO)NH acquired with a long isotropic mixing time can identify amino acids with large aliphatic side chains. Whereas the most sensitive MUSIC experiments identify amino acid types that cannot be detected by CC(CO)NH, comprising the residues with acid and amide groups, and aromatic rings in their side chains. Together these methods provide a means of identifying the majority of peaks in the 2D 15N HSQC spectrum which simplifies the backbone assignment work even for proteins, e.g., small kinases, whose standard spectra resulted in little spectral resolution and low signal intensities. 
The transglutaminase (BTG) from Bacillus subtilis is considered to be a new type of transglutaminase for the food industry. Given that the BTG gene only encodes a mature peptide, the expression of BTG in heterologous microbial hosts could affect their normal growth due to BTG's typical transglutaminase activity which can catalyze cross-linking of proteins in the cells. Therefore, we developed a novel approach to suppress BTG activity and reduce the toxicity on microbial hosts, thus improving BTG yield. Genes encoding the respective regions of transglutaminase propeptide from seven species of Streptomyces were fused to the N-terminal of the BTG gene to produce fusion proteins. We found that all the fused propeptides could suppress BTG activity. Importantly, BTG activity could be completely restored after the removal of the propeptides by proteolytic cleavage. Of the seven propeptides tested, the propeptide proD from Streptomyces caniferus had the strongest suppressive effect on BTG activity (70 % of the activity suppressed). Moreover, fusion protein proD-BTG (containing proD) also exhibited the highest yield which was more than twofold of the expression level of BTG in an active form in Escherichia coli. Secretion expression of BTG and proD-BTG in Corynebacterium glutamicum further showed that our novel approach was suitable for the efficient BTG expression, thus providing a valuable platform for further optimization of large-scale BTG production.
The biosynthesis of cell-wall peptidoglycan is a complex process that involves six different penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Two of these, PBP2x and PBP2b, are monofunctional transpeptidases that catalyse the formation of peptide cross-links between adjacent glycan strands. Both of them are bitopic membrane proteins with a small cytoplasmic and a large extracellular domain. PBP2x and PBP2b are essential for septal and peripheral peptidoglycan synthesis, respectively. Although several studies have investigated the properties of their extracellular catalytic domains, it is not known whether the role of their N-terminal non-catalytic domains extends beyond that of being simple anchoring devices. We therefore decided to use reciprocal domain swapping and mutational analysis to gain more information about the biological function of the membrane anchors and cytoplasmic tails of PBP2x and PBP2b. In the case of PBP2x both domains are essential, but neither the membrane anchor nor the cytoplasmic domain of PBP2x appear to serve as major localization signals. Instead, our results suggest that they are involved in interactions with other components of the divisome. Mutations of conserved amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of PBP2x resulted in loss of function, underlining the importance of this region. The cytoplasmic domain of PBP2b could be swapped with the corresponding domain from PBP2x, whereas replacement of the PBP2b transmembrane domain with the corresponding PBP2x domain gave rise to slow-growing cells with grossly abnormal morphology. When both domains were exchanged simultaneously the cells were no longer viable. 
γ-Glutamyltranspeptidases (γ-GTs) cleave the γ-glutamyl amide bond of glutathione and transfer the released γ-glutamyl group to water (hydrolysis) or acceptor amino acids (transpeptidation). These ubiquitous enzymes play a key role in the biosynthesis and degradation of glutathione, and in xenobiotic detoxification. Here we report the 3Å resolution crystal structure of Bacillus licheniformis γ-GT (BlGT) and that of its complex with l-Glu. X-ray structures confirm that BlGT belongs to the N-terminal nucleophilic hydrolase superfamily and reveal that the protein possesses an opened active site cleft similar to that reported for the homologous enzyme from Bacillus subtilis, but different from those observed for human γ-GT and for γ-GTs from other microorganisms. Data suggest that the binding of l-Glu induces a reordering of the C-terminal tail of BlGT large subunit and allow the identification of a cluster of acid residues that are potentially involved in the recognition of a metal ion. The role of these residues on the conformational stability of BlGT has been studied by characterizing the autoprocessing, enzymatic activity, chemical and thermal denaturation of four new Ala single mutants. The results show that replacement of Asp568 with an Ala affects both the autoprocessing and structural stability of the protein. 
N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) occurs on the majority of eukaryotic proteins and is catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). Nt-acetylation is increasingly recognized as a vital modification with functional implications ranging from protein degradation to protein localization. Although early genetic studies in yeast demonstrated that NAT-deletion strains displayed a variety of phenotypes, only recently, the first human genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a NAT gene was reported; boys diagnosed with the X-linked Ogden syndrome harbor a p.Ser37Pro (S37P) mutation in the gene encoding Naa10, the catalytic subunit of the NatA complex, and suffer from global developmental delays and lethality during infancy. Here, we describe a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model developed by introducing the human wild-type or mutant NatA complex into yeast lacking NatA (NatA-Δ). The wild-type human NatA complex phenotypically complemented the NatA-Δ strain, whereas only a partial rescue was observed for the Ogden mutant NatA complex suggesting that hNaa10 S37P is only partially functional in vivo. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a reduced subunit complexation for the mutant hNatA S37P next to a reduced in vitro catalytic activity. We performed quantitative Nt-acetylome analyses on a control yeast strain (yNatA), a yeast NatA deletion strain (yNatA-Δ), a yeast NatA deletion strain expressing wild-type human NatA (hNatA), and a yeast NatA deletion strain expressing mutant human NatA (hNatA S37P). Interestingly, a generally reduced degree of Nt-acetylation was observed among a large group of NatA substrates in the yeast expressing mutant hNatA as compared with yeast expressing wild-type hNatA. Combined, these data provide strong support for the functional impairment of hNaa10 S37P in vivo and suggest that reduced Nt-acetylation of one or more target substrates contributes to the pathogenesis of the Ogden syndrome. Comparative analysis between human and yeast NatA also provided new insights into the co-evolution of the NatA complexes and their substrates. For instance, (Met-)Ala- N termini are more prevalent in the human proteome as compared with the yeast proteome, and hNatA displays a preference toward these N termini as compared with yNatA. 
Technologies that allow the efficient chemical modification of proteins under mild conditions are widely sought after. Sortase-mediated peptide ligation provides a strategy for modifying the N or C terminus of proteins. This protocol describes the use of depsipeptide substrates (containing an ester linkage) with sortase A (SrtA) to completely modify proteins carrying a single N-terminal glycine residue under mild conditions in 4-6 h. The SrtA-mediated ligation reaction is reversible, so most labeling protocols that use this enzyme require a large excess of both substrate and sortase to produce high yields of ligation product. In contrast, switching to depsipeptide substrates effectively renders the reaction irreversible, allowing complete labeling of proteins with a small excess of substrate and catalytic quantities of sortase. Herein we describe the synthesis of depsipeptide substrates that contain an ester linkage between a threonine and glycolic acid residue and an N-terminal FITC fluorophore appended via a thiourea linkage. The synthesis of the depsipeptide substrate typically takes 2-3 d. 
Brainstem structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMNX) are essential for the digestive function of the stomach. A large number of neurotransmitters including glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are involved in the central control of gastric functions. However, the neuropeptidergic systems implicated in this process remain undetermined. Nesfatin-1 was recently identified as a neuropeptide cleaved from the N-terminal part of NEFA/nucleobindin 2 precursor (NUCB2). Central administration of this neuropeptide inhibits food consumption and gastroduodenal motility in rodents. Interestingly, the NTS and the DMNX contain a dense population of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 cell bodies. These observations led us to investigate the possible involvement of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons in the brainstem neuronal pathways that modulate gastric functions. We observed an activation of NTS NUCB2/nesfatinergic neurons after gastric distention in rats. In addition, we found that several NTS NUCB2/nesfatinergic neurons were GABAergic. Finally, when fluorogold was injected at the stomach level, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the DMNX which were also positive for NUCB2/nesfatin-1. Taken together, these observations suggest for the first time that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons of the NTS are sensitive to gastric distension and then may contribute to the satiety signal. 
Neurodegenerative processes are often accompanied by disruption of cholinergic systems; therefore, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors (AChEIs) may have therapeutic potential in some neurological conditions. We evaluated the effects of administration of donepezil, a widely used AChEI, in the cerebellum in a murine model of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). The NPC mice developed Purkinje cell loss at the age of 8 weeks; 4-week-old NPC mice given donepezil led to improvement of Purkinje cell survival that was associated with improvement of motor dysfunction in the mice. Because abnormal accumulation of cholesterol caused by impaired lipid homeostasis is the principal pathogenetic mechanism underlying NPC, we investigated the effects of donepezil on cholesterol metabolism in the NPC mice. Donepezil treatment reduced cholesterol accumulation in adult neural stem cells in vitro, and it downregulated the expression of the cholesterol synthesis factors' sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the cerebellum, implying that AChE activity might be associated with cholesterol homeostasis. Taken together, our findings suggest the role of a cholinergic pathway as a novel regulator of NPC progression and the potential application of AChEIs for the treatment of human NPC. 
The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor ligands on aversive learning were examined in the passive avoidance (PA) task in mice. Anxiety and autonomic functions were investigated using the elevated plus-maze and heart rate measurements. The main findings from this study are as follows. 1) Pretraining administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide] facilitated PA retention at low doses (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) but impaired PA retention at higher doses (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), consistent with previous findings in the rat. 2) Similar to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine, pretraining administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists [(R)-3-N,N-dicyclobutylamino-8 fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3H-1-benzopyran-5-carboxamide hydrogen(2R,3R)-tartrate monohydrate] NAD-299 (0.1-2 mg/kg) and [N-2-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinylethyl-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane carboxamide trihydrochloride] WAY-100635 (0.3-3 mg/kg) enhanced PA retention. 3) The impairment (1 mg/kg) but not the facilitation (0.03 mg/kg) induced by 8-OH-DPAT was fully blocked by NAD-299 (0.3 mg/kg). 4) 5-HT(1A) receptor ligands given immediate post-training failed to alter PA retention. 5) NAD-299 (0.3-1 mg/kg) blocked the impairment of PA retention caused by a) the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and b) the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 [(5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate]. 6) A subthreshold dose of scopolamine completely blocked the facilitatory effect of NAD-299 on PA retention. 7) Anxiety-related behaviors and autonomic function were unchanged by NAD-299. 8) In situ hybridization showed that septal neurons expressing 5-HT(1A) receptor mRNA were codistributed with markers for cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. These results indicate that systemic administration of 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists can facilitate cognitive performance, most likely by enhancing hippocampal/cortical cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions. Selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of cognitive deficits such as Alzheimer's disease.
Bladder overactivity (OAB) is a chronic and debilitating lower urinary tract (LUT) disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. LUT symptoms associated with OAB, such as urgency and urinary incontinence, cause a hygienic and social concern to patients, but their current pharmacological treatment is largely inadequate due to the lack of uroselectivity. Although OAB etiology remains multifactorial and poorly understood, increasing evidence indicates that serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] is an endogenous substance involved in the control of micturition at central and peripheral sites. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of three distinct 5-HT receptors localized at parasympathetic nerve terminals of the human bladder by measuring electrically evoked tritiated acetylcholine release in isolated detrusor strips. These prejunctional receptors, involved in both positive and negative feedback mechanisms regulating cholinergic transmission, have been characterized by means of three highly selective 5-HT antagonists for 5-HT(4), 5-HT(7), and 5-HT(1A) receptors, namely GR113808A ([1-[2-[(-methylsulphonyl) amino] ethyl]4-piperinidyl]methyl1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate succinate), SB269970 [(R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl)phenol hydrochloride], and WAY100635 [N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl)-cyclohexane-carboxamide trichloride]. Under these conditions, we confirmed the facilitatory role of 5-HT(4) heteroreceptors on acetylcholine release and revealed for the first time the occurrence of 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(1A) heteroreceptors with a facilitatory and an inhibitory action, respectively. Our findings strengthen the novel concept for the use of recently patented selective 5-HT agonists and antagonists for the control of OAB dysfunctions associated with inflammatory conditions, although their therapeutic efficacy needs to be explored in the clinical setting.
Skeletal muscle blood flow increases rapidly with exercise onset, but little is known of where or how the rapid onset of vasodilation (ROV) is governed within the microcirculation. In the retractor muscle of anesthetized hamsters (n = 26), we tested the following: 1) where in the resistance network ROV occurred, 2) how microvascular responses were affected by the duration of contraction, and 3) whether ROV involved muscarinic receptor activation. Single tetanic contractions were evoked using supramaximal field stimulation (100 Hz) to depolarize motor end plates. In response to a 200-ms contraction, red blood cell (rbc) velocity (V(rbc)) in feed arteries (FA; rest: 17.8 +/- 2 mm/s) increased within 1 s; a transient first peak (P1; 50 +/- 7% increase) occurred at approximately 5 s; and a second peak (P2; 50 +/- 15% increase) occurred at approximately 15-20 s. For vasodilation, P1 increased in frequency from proximal FA (2/7) and 1A arterioles (2/7) to distal 2A (4/7) and 3A (7/8) arterioles (P &lt; 0.05). Relative to resting (and maximal, 10 microM sodium nitroprusside) diameters, P1 increased from proximal (FA, 3 +/- 2% from 57 +/- 5 microm) to distal (3A, 27 +/- 6% from 14 +/- 1 microm) vessel branches (P &lt; 0.05). P2 was manifest in all vessels and increased relative to resting diameters from FA (11 +/- 3%) to 3A (36 +/- 6%) branches (P &lt; 0.01). Extending a contraction from 200 to 1,000 ms (tension x time integral from 17 +/- 2 to 73 +/- 4 mN/mm2 x s) increased P1 and P2 for V(rbc) and for diameter (P &lt; 0.05) while reducing the time of onset for P2 (P &lt; 0.05). Superfusion with atropine (10 microM) attenuated P1 of vasodilation (200 ms contraction) from 26 +/- 8% to 6 +/- 2% (n = 7 across branches; P &lt; 0.05) and reduced the diameter x time integral by 46 +/- 13% (P &lt; 0.05) without changing P2. We conclude that ROV in the hamster retractor muscle is initiated in distal arterioles, increases with the duration of muscle contraction, and involves muscarinic receptor activation.
The homology models of the extracellular domains of the neuronal alpha4beta2 (pdb code: 1ole) and ganglionic alpha3beta4 (pdb code: 1olf) rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes were refined and energetically minimized. In this work, a series of nAChR ligands (1-15) were docked into the modeled binding cavity of both receptors. High-affinity, toxic ligands such as epibatidine (1) and dechloroepibatidine (2) docked into cluster 1 with the charged tertiary amino group, forming a pi-cation interaction with Trp 147 on the (+) side of the alpha4 subunit and establishing a characteristic H-bond with the Lys 77 on the (-) side of the beta2 subunit. The nontoxic ligands such as 33bMet (3), (S)-A-85380 (4), and acetylcholine (6) docked into cluster 2 with the same pi-cation interaction but with the rest of the molecule occupying a different moiety of the binding pocket. Molecular docking into the alpha3beta4 subtype showed that both enantiomers of 1 (1a and 1b) are representative templates for ligands with affinity toward this ganglionic nAChR subtype. The ranking scores of the docked molecules confirm the existence of structure-dependent subtype selectivity and shed light on the design of specific and selective alpha4beta2 nAChR subtype ligands.
Excitatory transmission in the CNS necessitates the existence of dynamic controls of the glutamate uptake achieved by astrocytes, both in physiological conditions and under pathological circumstances characterized by gliosis. In this context, this study was aimed at evaluating the involvement of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in the regulation of glutamate transport in a model of rat astrocytes undergoing in vitro activation using a cocktail of growth factors (G5 supplement). The vast majority of the cells were found to take up aspartate, mainly through the glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), and at least 60% expressed functional mGluR5a. When exposed for 15 s to the selective group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, reactive astrocytes showed a significant increase in their capacity to take up aspartate. This effect was confirmed at the single-cell level, since activation of mGluRs significantly increased the initial slope of aspartate-dependent Na+ entry associated with the activity of glutamate transporters. This up-regulation was inhibited by an antagonist of mGluR5 and, more importantly, was sensitive to a specific glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) blocker. The acute influence of mGluR5 on aspartate uptake was phospholipase C- and protein kinase C-dependent, and was mimicked by phorbol esters. We conclude that mGluR5a contributes to a dynamic control of GLT-1 function in activated astrocytes, acting as a glial sensor of the extracellular glutamate concentration in order to acutely regulate the excitatory transmission.
In this study we showed that stimulation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) activates endogenous transient receptor potential-canonical, subtype 6 (TRPC6), channels in neuronal PC12D cells. Activation of TRPC6 channels is correlated with the formation of a multiprotein complex containing M1 mAChRs, TRPC6 channels, and protein kinase C (PKC). Formation of the M1 mAChR-TRPC6-PKC complex is transient, with highest levels reached approximately 2 min after stimulation of M1 mAChRs. PKC in the complex phosphorylates TRPC6 on a conserved serine residue in the carboxyl-terminal domain (Ser768 in the TRPC6A isoform and Ser714 in the TRPC6B isoform). The immunophilin FKBP12, the phosphatase calcineurin, and Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin are also recruited to the M1 mAChR-TRPC6-PKC complex following activation of M1 mAChRs and remain stably associated with the TRPC6 channels after M1 mAChRs and PKC have disassociated. Binding of FKBP12, calcineurin, and calmodulin to TRPC6 channels is blocked by the following: 1) inhibition of PKC; 2) mutation of the PKC phosphorylation site (Ser(7168/714)) in the channels; or 3) pretreatment with FK506 or rapamycin, immunosuppressants that directly bind FKBP12. Inhibition of FKBP12 binding blocks the dephosphorylation of TRPC6 channels and the disassociation of M1 mAChRs, without affecting disassociation of PKC. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A also blocks the dephosphorylation of TRPC6 and prevents the disassociation of M1 mAChRs. Together, these results show that activated TRPC6 channels form the center of a dynamic multiprotein complex that includes PKC and calcineurin, which respectively phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the channels. Phosphorylation of the TRPC6 channels by PKC is required for the binding of FKBP12, which in turn is required for the binding of calcineurin and calmodulin. Subsequent dephosphorylation of the channels by calcineurin is required for the disassociation of M1 mAChRs.
Recent data has suggested that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor is involved in cognitive processing. A novel 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, 4-cyano-N-{2R-[4-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]-dioxin-5-yl)-piperazin-1-yl]-propyl}-N-pyridin-2-yl-benzamide HCl (lecozotan), which has been characterized in multiple in vitro and in vivo pharmacological assays as a drug to treat cognitive dysfunction, is reported. In vitro binding and intrinsic activity determinations demonstrated that lecozotan is a potent and selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. Using in vivo microdialysis, lecozotan (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) antagonized the decrease in hippocampal extracellular 5-HT induced by a challenge dose (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) of 8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and had no effects alone at doses 10-fold higher. Lecozotan significantly potentiated the potassium chloride-stimulated release of glutamate and acetylcholine in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Chronic administration of lecozotan did not induce 5-HT(1A) receptor tolerance or desensitization in a behavioral model indicative of 5-HT(1A) receptor function. In drug discrimination studies, lecozotan (0.01-1 mg/kg i.m.) did not substitute for 8-OH-DPAT and produced a dose-related blockade of the 5-HT(1A) agonist discriminative stimulus cue. In aged rhesus monkeys, lecozotan produced a significant improvement in task performance efficiency at an optimal dose (1 mg/kg p.o.). Learning deficits induced by the glutamatergic antagonist MK-801 [(-)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] (assessed by perceptually complex and visual spatial discrimination) and by specific cholinergic lesions of the hippocampus (assessed by visual spatial discrimination) were reversed by lecozotan (2 mg/kg i.m.) in marmosets. The heterosynaptic nature of the effects of lecozotan imbues this compound with a novel mechanism of action directed at the biochemical pathologies underlying cognitive loss in Alzheimer's disease.
Changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) induced by agonists were simultaneously monitored in rat submandibular acini and ducts using a Ca(2+) imaging system. Substance P (SP) elicited marked increases in [Ca(2+)]i in acini but not in ducts. Carbachol (CCh) increased [Ca(2+)]i in both acini and ducts, but the maximal level was higher in acini than in ducts. In contrast, epinephrine (Epi) also induced an increase in [Ca(2+)]i in acini and ducts, but to a greater extent in ducts than in acini. Isoproterenol (ISO) caused a small but significant increase in [Ca(2+)]i in ducts but not acini. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using total RNA extracted from highly purified acinar and ductal cells showed that substance P receptor mRNA was present in acini at higher levels than in ducts. In contrast, alpha(1a)-adrenoceptor mRNA was more strongly expressed in ducts than in acini. The muscarinic receptors (M(3) and M(5)) and beta-adrenoceptors (beta(1) and beta(2)) were expressed at equivalent levels in both cell types. These results confirm that acini and ducts exhibit significant differences in agonist-induced Ca(2+) responses. Furthermore, substance P- and epinephrine-induced Ca(2+) responses were consistent with receptor mRNA expression in acini and ducts, but carbachol- and isoproterenol-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases were not.
A specific role for the dopamine D3 receptor in behavior has yet to be elucidated. We now report that dopamine D2/D3 agonists elicit dose-dependent yawning behavior in rats, resulting in an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. A series of experiments was directed toward the hypothesis that the induction of yawning is a D3 receptor-mediated effect, whereas the inhibition of the yawning observed at higher doses is due to competing D2 receptor activity. We compared several dopaminergic agonists with a range of in vitro D3 selectivity, including PD-128,907 [(S)-(+)-(4aR, 10bR)-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano-[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol HCl], PD-128,908 [(R)-(-)-(4aS,10bS)-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano-[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol HCl], quinelorane [(5aR-trans)-5,5a,6,7,8, 9,9a,10-octahydro-6-propylpyrido[2,3-g]quinazolin-2-amine dihydrochloride], pramipexole (N'-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzothiazole-2,6-diamine), 7-OH-DPAT [(+/-)-7-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin HBr], quinpirole [trans-(-)-(4aR)-4,4a,5,6,7,8, 8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-g]quinoline HCl], bromocriptine [(+)-2-bromo-12'-hydroxy-2'-(1-methylethyl)-5'-(2-methylpropyl) ergotaman-3',6'-18-trione methanesulfonate], and apomorphine [(R)-(-)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-6-methyl-4H-dibenzo-[de,g]quinoline-10,11-diol HCl] with respect to their ability to induce yawning in rats. A series of D2/D3 antagonists differing in selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors were evaluated for their ability to alter the effects of the dopamine agonists. The antagonists L-741,626 (3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-l-yl]methyl-1H-indole), haloperidol (4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-piperidinyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-butanone HCl), nafadotride (N-[(1-butyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-4-cyano-1-methoxy-2-naphtha-lenecarboxamide), U99194 (2,3-dihydro-5,6-dimethoxy-N,N-dipropyl-1H-inden-2-amine maleate), SB-277011A (trans-N-[4-[2-(6-cyano-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]cyclohexyl]-4-quinolinecarboxamide), and PG01037 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide HCl) were used to determine effects on dose-response curves for D2/D3 agonist-induced yawning. In addition, the potential contribution of cholinergic and/or serotonergic mechanisms to the yawning response was investigated using a series of pharmacological tools including scopolamine [(a,S)-a-(hydroxymethyl)benzeneacetic acid (1a,2b,4b,5a,7b)-9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.02,4]-non7-yl ester hydrobromide], mianserin (1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-2-methyldibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2-a]azepine HCl), and the D3-preferring antagonists nafadotride, U99194, SB-277011A, and PG01037 to differentially modulate yawning induced by PD-128,907, physostigmine [(3aS)-cis-1,2,3,3a,8,8a-hexahydro-1,3a,8-trimethylpyrrolo[2,3-b]indol-5-ol methylcarbamate hemisulfate], and N-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperazine HCl. The results of these experiments provide convergent evidence that dopamine D2/D3 agonist-induced yawning is a D3 agonist-mediated behavior, with subsequent inhibition of yawning being driven by competing D2 agonist activity. Thus, dopamine agonist-induced yawning may represent an in vivo method for selectively identifying D3 and D2 receptor-mediated activities.
To study the presence of muscarinic and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in a normal human conjunctival epithelial (IOBA-NHC) cell line.
Neurotransmitter receptors were determined in IOBA-NHC cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Antibodies to M(1)-, M(2)-, and M(3)-muscarinic and to alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)-, alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, alpha(2C)-, beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenergic receptor subtypes were used. Different culture media were tested, including the addition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and/or interferon (IFN)-gamma. Normal human conjunctiva biopsy specimens and rat tissues were used in control experiments.
By immunofluorescence microscopy, all receptor subtypes, except the alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptor, were detected in control biopsy specimens. By flow cytometry, the M(2)- and M(3)-muscarinic receptors and alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)-, alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, alpha(2C)-, beta(1)-, and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors were detected intracellularly and in cell membranes of the IOBA-NHC cells. M(1)-muscarinic and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors were detected only intracellularly, but were mobilized to the cell membrane when cholera toxin and hydrocortisone were omitted from the culture medium. Confocal microscopy detected the M(2) and M(3)-muscarinic and alpha(1A)-, alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Western blot analyses showed bands for all receptors. M(2)-muscarinic and alpha(1B)- and alpha(2B)-adrenergic receptors expression was upregulated when cells were treated with the proinflammatory cytokines IFN gamma and/or TNF alpha.
The IOBA-NHC cell line maintained expression of the neurotransmitter receptors expressed in normal human conjunctival epithelium. A proinflammatory medium upregulated expression of some receptors. Although the functional state of these receptors is unknown, these findings justify further use of the IOBA-NHC cell line to study the neural component of conjunctival inflammation.
Metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors have recently been recognized as targets for anesthetics and analgesics. In particular, G(q)-coupled receptors such as muscarinic M(1) receptors (M(1)R) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 2A receptors have been reported to be targets for anesthetics. Much less is known, however, about the effects of anesthetics on G(i)-coupled receptors. Here we report a method to analyze functions of G(i)-coupled receptors in Xenopus oocytes expressing a chimeric G alpha protein. A chimeric G alpha(q) protein G alpha(qi5), which contains carboxy-terminus five amino acids of G alpha(i), enables G(i)-coupled receptors to couple to Gq-coupled receptor-mediated downstream pathways such as activation of phospholipase C. We determined acetylcholine (ACh)-induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing G(i)-coupled muscarinic M(2)receptors (M(2)R) with the chimeric G alpha(qi5). Although ACh did not induce any currents in oocytes expressing M(2)R alone, it caused robust Cl(-) currents in oocytes coexpressing M(2)R with G alpha(qi5). The EC(50) of the ACh-induced Cl(-) current mediated through G alpha(qi5) was 0.2 micromol/l, which was 2.2 times higher than that of the ACh-induced G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) currents activated by G beta gamma subunits liberated from endogenously expressed G alpha(i) in Xenopus oocytes. Other G(i)-coupled somatostatin type 2, 5-HT(1A) and delta-opioid receptors, when coexpressed with G alpha(qi5) in oocytes, also caused robust Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents. In oocytes coexpressing M(2)R and G alpha(qi5), a volatile anesthetic halothane inhibited M(2)R-induced Cl(-) currents in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC(50) of 1.1 mmol/l, suggesting that halothane inhibits M(2)R-induced cellular responses at clinically relevant concentrations. Treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X produced a 3.5-fold enhancement of the initial Cl(-) currents induced by 1 micromol/l ACh in oocytes expressing M(2)R and G(qi5). The rate of halothane-induced inhibition of Cl(-) currents elicited by ACh, however, was not changed in such oocytes pretreated with GF109203X. These findings suggest that halothane inhibits the M(2)R-induced signaling by acting at sites other than PKC activity. Collectively these findings suggest that the use of oocyte expressing G alpha(qi5) would be helpful to examine the effects of anesthetics or analgesics on the function of G(i)-coupled receptors in the Xenopus oocyte expression system.
Recent studies have shown that tachykinins mediate slow synaptic transmission to myenteric AH (afterhyperpolarising) neurons via neurokinin-3 receptors (NK(3)R). This study investigated a similar role for neurokinin-1 receptors (NK(1)R) and compared the effect of selective receptor antagonists on non-cholinergic slow excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in myenteric AH neurons of the guinea-pig ileum. Slow EPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of circumferentially oriented presynaptic nerves were mimicked by application of senktide, an NK(3)R agonist. [Sar(9),Met(O(2))(11)]-substance P, an NK(1)R agonist, depolarised a smaller number of neurons. SR142801, a selective NK(3)R antagonist (100 nM), inhibited slow EPSPs and responses to senktide, but had no effect on depolarisations evoked by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. SR140333, a selective NK(1)R antagonist, inhibited slow EPSPs in a subset of neurons and blocked responses to [Sar(9),Met(O(2))(11)]-substance P, but not to senktide or forskolin. Slow EPSPs that were predominantly mediated by NK(1)R had significantly shorter latencies than those due to activation of NK(3)R. After blockade of slow EPSPs, slow hyperpolarizing responses to presynaptic nerve stimulation were revealed in one-third of neurons. These events, which were associated with a decrease in input resistance and blocked by tetrodotoxin, were equated with slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They were abolished by the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]-piperazine (NAN-190), but unaffected by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. In conclusion, these results provide the first direct evidence that NK(1)R mediate some slow excitatory synaptic input to myenteric AH neurons, and suggest that NK(1)R and NK(3)R activate distinct signal transduction pathways. These results also demonstrate that slow inhibitory synaptic transmission, which may be mediated by 5-hydroxytryptamine, is more prevalent in the myenteric plexus than previously indicated.
Future demographic developments will challenge urology with a steadily increasing incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) derived from the aging bladder. Obstruction, instability and hypocontractility, which may be caused by changes in the receptor profile of the detrusor, are typical pathophysiologic findings in geriatric bladder dysfunction. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and diabetes mellitus are age-associated comorbidities with an additional influence on bladder receptors. Muscarinic (M(2), M(3)), purinergic (P2X, P2Y) and adrenergic receptors (alpha(1), beta(3)) are targets of efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic bladder innervation. Although the results from animal experiments are somewhat inconsistent, aging and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) probably cause partial cholinergic denervation of the detrusor with a subsequent upregulation of muscarinic receptor sensitivity leading to bladder instability. The non-cholinergic (atropine-resistant) component of the detrusor contraction rises with aging and BOO to 50%, emphasizing the increasing impact of purinergic receptors in geriatric LUTS. alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors are modulated in the aging bladder by a shift from the predominant alpha(1a) subtype to the alpha(1d) subtype, which shows 100-fold higher affinity towards norepinephrine and increases alpha-adrenergic bladder susceptibility. No data are available on the changes in beta(3) receptor density or sensitivity with aging. Moreover, the role of sensory C-fiber receptors in geriatric LUTS remains completely unclear, although specific C-fiber blockers are already under clinical evaluation (capsaicin, resiniferatoxin).
Pharmacogenetics, the inherited basis for interindividual differences in drug response, has rapidly expanded with the advent of new molecular tools and the sequencing of the human genome, yielding pharmacogenomics. We review here recent ideas and findings regarding pharmacogenomics of components of the autonomic nervous system, in particular, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, postsynaptic receptors with which the parasympathetic and sympathetic neurotransmitters, acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine, respectively, interact. The receptor subtypes that mediate these responses, M(1-3) muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs), and alpha(1A,B,D)-, alpha(2A,B,C)-, and beta(1,2,3)-adrenergic receptors (AR), show highly variable expression of genetic variants; variants of mAChRs and alpha(1)-ARs are relatively rare, whereas alpha(2)-AR and beta-AR subtype variants are quite common. The largest amount of data is available regarding variants of the latter ARs and represents efforts to associate certain receptor genotypes, most commonly, single nucleotide polymorphisms, with particular phenotypes (e.g., cardiovascular and metabolic responses). In vitro and in vivo studies have yielded inconsistent results; definitive conclusions are limited. We identify several conceptual and methodological problems with available data: sample size, ethnicity, tissue differences, coding versus noncoding variants, limited studies of haplotypes, and interaction among variants. Thus, although progress has been made in identifying genetic variation that influences drug response fo autonomic nervous system components, we are still at the early stages of defining the most critical genetic determinants and their role in human physiology and pharmacology.
Clozapine (CLZ), an atypical antipsychotic drug (APD), produces minimal extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and has significant advantages for treating both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients. CLZ has been established as a discriminative cue in the drug discrimination paradigm and in generalization tests the CLZ cue is more selective for atypical, rather than typical, APDs. However, greater selectivity for atypical antipsychotics has been demonstrated with a lower (1.25 mg/kg) CLZ training dose in rats [Psychopharmacology, 149 (2000) 189], rather than the traditional, higher training dose (5.0 mg/kg). It is therefore of interest to evaluate the properties mediating the 1.25 mg/kg CLZ discriminative cue. In the present study, rats were trained to discriminate either 1.25 mg/kg (N=7) or 5.0 mg/kg (N=7) CLZ from vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination task. The typical antipsychotic haloperidol (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) did not substitute for either CLZ cue, whereas the atypical antipsychotic melperone (0.37-3.0 mg/kg) provided full substitution in both groups (&gt;80% CLZ-appropriate responding). The 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.04-0.16 mg/kg), and the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100907 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) did not produce substitution in either group. (+)-8-OH-DPAT combined with haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg) engendered only partial substitution (&gt;60% CLZ-appropriate responding) for both CLZ cues, and M100907 combined with haloperidol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg doses) failed to provide substitution in either group. Trihexyphenidyl (0.18-6.0 mg/kg), a muscarinic M(1)-preferring receptor antagonist, engendered full substitution for the 1.25 mg/kg CLZ cue, but only partial substitution for the 5.0 mg/kg CLZ cue. These results provide evidence that antagonism at the muscarinic M(1) receptor is sufficient to provide 1.25 mg/kg CLZ-like discriminative stimulus effects.
Drug discrimination studies with clozapine have shown that such assays are of value in analysing the actions of novel antipsychotic agents in vivo.
To evaluate the role of specific receptors in the discriminative stimulus properties of the novel "atypical" antipsychotic quetiapine.
Rats were trained to discriminate quetiapine at 10 mg/kg and tested with a range of ligands, selective for specific classes of receptor.
Full generalization to quetiapine was only seen with quetiapine itself (100%) and with the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (87%). Partial generalization was seen with the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (63%), the presumed preferential dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist PNU 91194A (54%) and the 5-HT/H(1)/M(1) antagonist cyproheptadine (55%). Minimal (&lt;40%) or no (0%) generalization was seen with mepyramine (H(1) antagonist), SCH 23390 (D(1) antagonist), raclopride (D(2/3 )antagonist), ketanserin and MDL 100,907 (5-HT(2A ) antagonists), ondansetron (5-HT(3) antagonist), SB 242,084 (5-HT(2C) antagonist), 8-OHDPAT (5-HT(1A) agonist) yohimbine (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide.
Together with data from a previous study (Smith and Goudie 2002) in which we observed full generalization to quetiapine with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine, but not with typical antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) or the novel antipsychotic amisulpride, these data suggest that: i) the discriminative stimulus properties of quetiapine, like those of clozapine, probably reflect a "compound" stimulus which involves several classes of receptor; ii) the quetiapine cue is of value in analysing, and screening for, quetiapine- and clozapine-like agents in vivo; iii) blockade of muscarinic receptors is sufficient, although not necessary, to achieve full generalization to quetiapine; and iv) alpha(1-)adrenoceptors may be implicated in the quetiapine discriminative stimulus.
Cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease are accompanied by a number of alterations in other transmitter systems including glutamate, noradrenaline and serotonin, suggesting the involvement also of other neurotransmitter systems in the pathogenesis of the disease. To address the question whether beta-amyloid may contribute to these deficits, brain tissue from transgenic Tg2576 mice with Alzheimer plaque pathology at ages of 5 (still no significant plaque load) and 17 months (moderate to high cortical beta-amyloid plaque load) were examined for a number of cholinergic and non-cholinergic markers. Transgenic mice with no significant plaque load demonstrated reduced hemicholinium-3 (HCh-3) binding to choline uptake sites in anterior brain regions as compared to non-transgenic littermates, while in aged transgenic mice with high number of plaque deposits decreased HCh-3 binding levels were accompanied by increased vesicular acetylcholine transporter binding in selected cortical brain regions. In aged transgenic mice GABA(A), NMDA, AMPA, kainate, and beta-adrenergic as well 5-HT(1A)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptor binding levels were hardly affected, whereas alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor binding was increased in selected cerebral cortical regions as compared to non-transgenic littermates. The development of changes in both cholinergic and non-cholinergic markers in transgenic Tg2576 mouse brain already before the onset of progressive plaque deposition provides in vivo evidence of a modulatory role of soluble beta-amyloid on cortical neurotransmission and may be referred to the deficits in learning and memory observed in these mice also before significant plaque load.
There is a hypothesis that autoimmune abnormalities in neurotransmitter receptors might cause some psychiatric disorders. Using a sensitive radioligand assay, we detected serum autoantibodies to recombinant human muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 (CHRM1, 34.4%), mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1, 13.1%), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A, 7.4%), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2, 4.9%) in 122 psychiatric patients. Positive antibodies to CHRM1 were found in 34.1%, 34.9%, 33.3%, and 9.1% of patients with schizophrenic disorders (n=44), mood disorders (n=63), other psychiatric disorders (n=15) and autoimmune diseases (n=33), respectively. All three patients with neuroleptic maliganant syndrome had high activities of autoantibodies to CHRM1, OPRM1, and/or HTR1A. Our data suggest that autoimmunity to neurotransmitter receptors might be associated with the induction of psychiatric symptoms and have some relation to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Tonic impulse flow in the septohippocampal GABAergic pathway is essential for normal cognitive functioning and is sustained, in part, by acetylcholine (ACh) that is released locally via axon collaterals of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Septohippocampal cholinergic neurons degenerate in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. While the importance of the muscarinic effects of ACh on septohippocampal GABAergic neurons is well recognized, the nicotinic effects of ACh remain unstudied despite the reported benefits of nicotine on cognitive functioning. In the present study, using electrophysiological recordings in a rat brain slice preparation, rapid applications of nicotine excited 90% of retrogradely labelled septohippocampal GABA-type neurons with an EC50 of 17 microm and increased the frequency of spontaneously occurring, impulse-dependent fast GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic currents via the alpha4beta2-nicotinic receptor. Interestingly, tetrodotoxin blocked all effects of nicotine on septohippocampal GABAergic type neurons, suggesting involvement of indirect mechanisms. We demonstrate that the effects of nicotine on septohippocampal GABA-type neurons involve recruitment of a novel, local glutamatergic circuitry as (i). Group I metabotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonists reduced the effects of nicotine; (ii). the number of nicotine responsive neurons was significantly reduced in recordings from slices that had been trimmed so as to reduce the number of glutamate-containing neurons within the slice preparation; (iii). in light and ultrastructural double immunocytochemical labelling studies vesicular glutamate 2 transporter immunoreactive terminals made synaptic contacts with parvalbumin-immunoreactive septohippocampal GABAergic neurons. The discovery of a local glutamatergic circuit within the septum may provide another avenue for restoring septohippocampal GABAergic functions in neurodegenerative disorders associated with a loss of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons.
The effects of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635 on recognition memory were investigated in two different amnestic models in the rat by using the object recognition task. WAY 100635 at 1 mg/kg, but not at 0.3 mg/kg, counteracted scopolamine-induced performance deficits in the acquisition version of this behavioral paradigm. At the same dose, WAY 100635 antagonized extinction of recognition memory in the normal rat, suggesting that it affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. These results support and extend prior findings that interactions between the serotonergic and cholinergic systems are relevant to cognition and indicate that WAY 100635 modulates different aspects of recognition memory.
The effect of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 protein Tat was investigated on neurotransmitter release from human and rat cortical nerve endings. Tat failed to affect the release of several neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, GABA, norepinephrine, and others, but it evoked the release of [3H]ACh via increase of cytosolic [Ca2+]. In human nerve terminals, the Tat effect partly depends on Ca2+ entry through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, because Cd2+ halved the Tat-evoked release. Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) and mobilization of Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive intraterminal stores are also involved, because the Tat effect was prevented by mGluR antagonists 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride and 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester and by the IP3 receptor antagonists heparin and xestospongin C. Furthermore, the group I selective mGlu agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine enhanced [3H]ACh release. In rat nerve terminals, the Tat-evoked release neither depends on external Ca2+ ions entry nor on IP3-mediated mechanisms. Tat seems to cause mobilization of Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive internal stores because its effect was prevented by both 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose and dantrolene. The Tat-evoked release from human synaptosomes was mimicked by the peptide sequences Tat 32-62, Tat 49-86, and Tat 41-60. In contrast, the Tat 49-86 and Tat 61-80 fragments, but not the Tat 32-62 fragment, were active in rat synaptosomes. In conclusion, Tat elicits Ca2+-dependent [3H]ACh release by species-specific intraterminal mechanisms by binding via discrete amino acid sequences to different receptive sites on human and rat cholinergic terminals.
The disturbance of the central nervous system and immunological abnormalities have been suggested in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We focused on immunological abnormalities against neurotransmitter receptors in CFS. Using a sensitive radioligand assay, we examined serum autoantibodies to recombinant human muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 (CHRM1), mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in patients with CFS (n=60) and results were compared with those in patients with autoimmune disease (n=33) and in healthy controls (n=30). The mean anti-CHRM1 antibody index was significantly higher in patients with CFS (p&lt;0.0001) and autoimmune disease (p&lt;0.05) than that in healthy controls, and positive reaction was found in 53.3% of patients with CFS. Anti-OPRM1 antibodies, anti-HTR1A antibodies, and anti-DRD2 antibodies were found in 15.2, 1.7, and 5.0% of patients with CFS, respectively. Anti-nuclear antibodies were found in 56.7% (34/60) of patients with CFS, but anti-nuclear antibody titers did not correlate with the activities of the above four autoantibodies. The patients with positive autoantibodies to CHRM1 had a significantly higher mean score (1.81) of 'feeling of muscle weakness' than negative patients (1.18) among CFS patients (p&lt;0.01). Higher scores on 'painful node', 'forgetfulness', and 'difficulty thinking' were also found in CFS patients with anti-CHRM1 antibodies but did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, autoantibodies to CHRM1 were detected in a large number of CFS patients and were related to CFS symptoms. Our findings suggested that subgroups of CFS are associated with autoimmune abnormalities of CHRM1.
During aging, neurotransmission systems such as the cholinergic and serotonergic ones are altered. Using rats aged 3 or 24-26 months, this study investigated whether the well-described 8-OH-DPAT-induced increase of hippocampal acetylcholine release was altered in aged rats and whether it may vary according to the magnitude of age-related cognitive deficits. Long-Evans female rats aged 24-26 months were classified as good or bad performers on the basis of their reference-memory performance in a Morris water-maze task. Subsequently, the efficiency of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in triggering hippocampal acetylcholine release was evaluated by in vivo microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Besides a reduced baseline release in aged rats and a correlation between the baseline release and probe-trial performance in all rats, the results demonstrated that 8-OH-DPAT produced a significant increase of hippocampal acetylcholine release (peak value) in all rats, whether aged or young. While significant in bad performers (+56%), this increase did not reach significance in good performers (+32%). The results suggest that (i) some aspects of cognitive alterations related to aging might be linked to the baseline release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus, and (ii) the cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus of aged rats responds almost normally to systemic activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors, and (iii) differential alterations of cholinergic/serotonergic interactions assessed by determination of the 8-OH-DPAT-induced release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus could not be linked with clarity to the cognitive status of aged rats.
Degeneration of the cholinergic magnocellular neurons in the basal forebrain and their cortical projections is a major feature of the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to memory dysfunction, attentional functions are also impaired in AD.
We investigated the extent to which the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil reversed the attentional performance deficit in nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) lesioned rats. We also examined the effects of a selective and potent 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY 100635, on the attentional deficit of NBM lesioned rats.
We injected alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) into the NBM to selectively destroy cholinergic neurons projecting to the neocortex. Attentional functions were examined using the 5-CSRT task, in which hungry rats were required to locate brief visual targets presented randomly in one of five locations in a specially designed chamber. RESULTS. AMPA lesions of the NBM caused marked reductions in choline acetyltransferase activity (ChAT) ranging from 30 to 46% in medial areas of the cortex (medial-frontal and cingulate) and from 58 to 72% in more lateral areas (anterior-dorso-lateral and parietal). AMPA lesioned rats made fewer correct responses (choice accuracy), longer latency to correct response and an increase in the number of premature and perseverative responses. These impairments showed some recovery over the next 12 weeks. Reducing the duration of the visual stimulus reinstated the impairments in choice accuracy. The anticholinesterase inhibitor donepezil at 1.0 mg/kg but not 0.5 mg/kg reversed the impairments in choice accuracy and correct response latency. The premature and perseverative over-responding of AMPA lesioned rats remained unchanged. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg WAY 100635 to AMPA-lesioned rats improved their choice accuracy but did not shorten correct response latencies. The number of premature responses was reduced by WAY 100635 but perseverative over-responding was not affected.
The attentional impairments induced due to cortical cholinergic dysfunction may be ameliorated by cholinergic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors. In addition, 5-HT(1A) receptors and the cortical cholinergic system exert balanced opposition in regulating attentional performance in the rat. Blockade of 5-HT(1A) receptors may be useful to treat some aspects of attentional dysfunction in AD.
Systemic administration of the muscarinic-receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine produces cognitive deficits in humans, nonhuman primates and rodents. In humans, these deficits resemble symptoms of dementia seen in Alzheimer's disease. The passive avoidance (PA) task has been one of the most frequently used animal models for studying cholinergic mechanisms in learning and memory. The present study examined the ability of two selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists WAY 100635 and NAD-299 (robalzotan) and two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors tacrine and donepezil to attenuate the impairment of PA retention caused by the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine in the rat. Although demonstrating differences in their temporal kinetics, both WAY 100635 and NAD-299 attenuated the impairment of PA caused by scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). Donepezil did not block the PA deficit caused by the 0.3 mg/kg dose of scopolamine, but it prevented the inhibitory effects of the 0.2 mg/kg dose of scopolamine. In contrast, tacrine was effective vs both the 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg doses of scopolamine. These results indicate that (1). a functional 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonism can attenuate the anterograde amnesia produced by muscarinic-receptor blockade, and (2). the AChE inhibitors tacrine and donepezil differ in their ability to modify muscarinic-receptor-mediated function in vivo. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists may have a potential in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in psychopathologies characterized by reduced ACh transmission such as Alzheimer's disease.
Animal studies indicate that the anxiolytic properties of the antipsychotic agent cyamemazine may result from blockade of serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptors and to a lesser extent from blockade of serotonin 5-HT(3) receptors. Here, we used human recombinant receptors to determine the relative affinity of cyamemazine for serotonin and dopamine receptor subtypes. In addition, cyamemazine was tested in other brain receptor types and subtypes which are considered to mediate central nervous systems effects of drugs. Hence, cyamemazine affinity was determined in human recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells (hD(2), hD(3), and hD(4.4) receptors, h5-HT(1A), h5-HT(2A), h5-HT(2C), and h5-HT(7), and hM(1), hM(2), hM(3), hM(4), and hM(5) receptors), L-cells (hD(1) receptor), and HEK-293 cells (h5-HT(3) receptors) or natively present in N1E-115 cells (5-HT(3) receptors) or in rat cerebral cortex (non-specific alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, H(3) histamine receptors), and guinea-pig cerebellum (H(1) central and H(2) histamine receptors) membranes. Similarly to atypical antipsychotics, cyamemazine exhibited high affinity for: (i) h5-HT(2A) receptors (K(i)=1.5+/-0.7 nM, mean+/-SEM, N=3) and this was four times higher than for hD(2) receptors (K(i)=5.8+/-0.8 nM), (ii) h5-HT(2C) receptors (K(i)=11.8+/-2.2nM), and (iii) 5-HT(7) receptors (K(i)=22 nM). Conversely, cyamemazine exhibited very low affinity for h5-HT(3) receptors (K(i)=2.9+/-0.4 microM). In conclusion, similarly to atypical antipsychotic agents, cyamemazine, possesses high affinity for h5-HT(2A), h5-HT(2C), and h5-HT(7) receptors, a feature which can explain its low propensity to cause extrapyramidal adverse reactions in clinical practice. The high affinity for h5-HT(2C) receptors, but not for h5-HT(3) receptors, can account for the anxiolytic activity of cyamemazine in human subjects.
Several behavioural, neurochemical, and structural alterations found in isolation-reared rats are similar to those in human schizophrenia. This study investigated changes in cholinergic and serotonergic function in the hippocampus following isolation rearing. Rats were reared in social isolation from weaning for 6 weeks before study and compared to group-reared rats. An in vitro electrophysiological study investigated the effect of isolation rearing on postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) function on CA1 hippocampal neurones activated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol and found no change in the sensitivity of these postsynaptic receptors between the groups. However, a change in presynaptic function was identified, as there was a significant reduction in the time taken for neuronal firing to recover to 50% of the original rate following 5-HT (10 microM) application, in isolation compared to group-reared rats. These data suggest a possible change in reuptake following isolation. Uptake studies using (3)[H]5-HT, however, found no change in the inhibition of uptake produced by either fluoxetine or paroxetine in isolation compared to group-reared rats. The selective 5-HT(1B) antagonist CP-294253 (1 microM), increased endogenous 5-HT release from hippocampal slices in vitro and this effect was greater (P &lt; 0.001) in group compared to isolation-reared rats. These results indicate that the change in presynaptic 5-HT neuronal function was due to impaired autoreceptor responsiveness. Carbachol (1 microM) increased the firing rate of all neurones recorded but only a proportion of these showed a concentration-related increase. Isolation rearing increased the sensitivity of neurones, showing a concentration-related increase in firing in response to carbachol, but had no effect on the other neurones. In summary, the present study showed that isolation rearing alters presynaptic 5-HT(1B) but not postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor activity in the hippocampus. Isolation rearing in the rat results in hippocampal dysfunction, including reduced serotonergic and enhanced muscarinic activity of some neurones. These effects may in part underlie the behavioural consequences of isolation relevant to human developmental disorders.
Newborn rats were treated daily with thyroid hormone (TH) until postnatal day 12. In the adult animals we measured the densities of glutamatergic (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), kainic acid (KA)), cholinergic (muscarinic subtype 1 and 2 (M1, M2)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic (GABA(A)) and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(1A))) binding sites using quantitative receptor-autoradiography with tritiated ligands. In the TH-treated rats the KA binding site density was increased in the stratum oriens of cornu ammonis (CA)3, the terminal field of the infrapyramidal mossy fibers (IPMF). Densities of M2 and 5-HT(1A) were increased in the CA1 region. In contrast, binding site densities for NMDA in the entire hippocampus and for AMPA in the dentate gyrus were reduced, whereas binding site densities for M2 and GABA(A) remained unchanged. From this study we conclude that concomitant with the increase of the IPMF zone the density of the KA binding sites is specifically enhanced. In addition, we found a general shift from binding sites receiving cortical to those receiving subcortical input in the hippocampus.
The chronic dietary intake of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can modulate learning and memory by being incorporated into neuronal plasma membranes. Representatives of two PUFA families, the n-3 and n-6 types become integrated into membrane phospholipids, where the actual (n-6)/(n-3) ratio can determine membrane fluidity and thus the function of membrane-bound proteins. In the present experiment we studied hippocampal neurotransmitter receptors after chronic administration of n-3 PUFA enriched diets in a brain hypoperfusion model, which mimics decreased cerebral perfusion as it occurs in ageing and dementia. Male Wistar rats received experimental diets with a decreased (n-6)/(n-3) ratio from weaning on. Chronic experimental cerebral hypoperfusion was imposed by a permanent, bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (2VO) at the age of 4 months. The experiment was terminated when the rats were 7 months old. Three receptor types, the muscarinic 1, serotonergic 1A and the glutaminergic NMDA receptors were labeled in hippocampal slices by autoradiographic methods. Image analysis demonstrated that 2VO increased muscarinic 1 and NMDA receptor density, specifically in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 region, respectively. The increased ratio of n-3 fatty acids in combination with additional dietary supplements enhanced the density of the serotonergic 1A and muscarinic 1 receptors, while n-3 fatty acids alone increased binding only to the muscarinic 1 receptors. Since the examined receptor types reacted differently to the diets, we concluded that besides changes in membrane fluidity, the biochemical regulation of receptor sensitivity might also play a role in increasing hippocampal receptor density.
Because little comparative information is available concerning receptor profiles of antiparkinson drugs, affinities of 14 agents were determined at diverse receptors implicated in the etiology and/or treatment of Parkinson's disease: human (h)D(1), hD(2S), hD(2L), hD(3), hD(4), and hD(5) receptors; human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A), h5-HT(1B), h5-HT(1D), h5-HT(2A), h5-HT(2B), and h5-HT(2C) receptors; halpha(1A)-, halpha(1B)-, halpha(1D)-, halpha(2A)-, halpha(2B)-, halpha(2C)-, rat alpha(2D)-, hbeta(1)-, and hbeta(2)-adrenoceptors (ARs); and native histamine(1) receptors. A correlation matrix (294 pK(i) values) demonstrated substantial "covariance". Correspondingly, principal components analysis revealed that axis 1, which accounted for 76% variance, was associated with the majority of receptor types: drugs displaying overall high versus modest affinities migrated at opposite extremities. Axis 2 (7% of variance) differentiated drugs with high affinity for hD(4) and H(1) receptors versus halpha(1)-AR subtypes. Five percent of variance was attributable to axis 3, which distinguished drugs with marked affinity for hbeta(1)- and hbeta(2)-ARs versus hD(5) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. Hierarchical (cluster) analysis of global homology generated a dendrogram differentiating two major groups possessing low versus high affinity, respectively, for multiple serotonergic and hD(5) receptors. Within the first group, quinpirole, quinerolane, ropinirole, and pramipexole interacted principally with hD(2), hD(3), and hD(4) receptors, whereas piribedil and talipexole recognized dopaminergic receptors and halpha(2)-ARs. Within the second group, lisuride and terguride manifested high affinities for all sites, with roxindole/bromocriptine, cabergoline/pergolide, and 6,7-dihydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-2-ammotetralin (TL99)/apomorphine comprising three additional subclusters of closely related ligands. In conclusion, an innovative multivariate analysis revealed marked heterogeneity in binding profiles of antiparkinson agents. Actions at sites other than hD(2) receptors likely participate in their (contrasting) functional profiles.
Cultured astrocytes express a spectrum of neurotransmitter receptors. However, little is known about these receptors in situ. We previously reported the absence of beta(2) adrenergic receptors on astrocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we used [(3)H]-radioligands and receptor autoradiography to screen for a variety of other aminergic receptors in six silent chronic astrogliotic plaques in brain tissue obtained from five patients with MS. Dopamine D(1) and histamine H(1) receptors were absent. We detected specific binding for cholinergic muscarinic receptors &gt; dopamine D(2), alpha(1-) and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors &gt; 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B/D), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2c), 5-HT(4), and dopamine D(3) receptors. Radiotracers for these aminergic receptors might be useful for studying astrogliosis in patients with MS, and compounds acting at some of these receptors may have potential to modulate astroglial function in MS.
Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist and prototypical anxiogenic drug, has been extensively utilized in animal models of anxiety. PTZ produces a reliable discriminative stimulus which is largely mediated by the GABA(A) receptor. Several classes of compounds can modulate the PTZ discriminative stimulus including 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(3), NMDA, glycine, and L-type calcium channel ligands. Spontaneous PTZ-lever responding is seen in trained rats during withdrawal from GABA(A) receptor compounds such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, and also ethanol, morphine, nicotine, cocaine, haloperidol, and phencyclidine. This effect is largely mediated by the GABA(A) receptor, which suggests that anxiety may be part of a generalized withdrawal syndrome mediated by the GABA(A) receptor. There are also important hormonal influences on PTZ. Corticosterone plays some role in mediation of its anxiogenic effects. There is a marked sex difference in response to the discriminative stimulus effects of PTZ, and estrogens appear to protect against its anxiogenic effects. Further work with the PTZ drug discrimination is warranted for characterization of anxiety during withdrawal, and the hormonal mechanisms of anxiety.
Abnormalities in the density of neuroreceptors that regulate norepinephrine and serotonin release have been repeatedly reported in brains of suicide victims with mood disorders. Recently, the modulation of the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to G-proteins has been introduced as a suitable measure of receptor activity in postmortem human brain. The present study sought to evaluate the function of several G-protein coupled receptors in postmortem brain of suicide victims with mood disorders. Concentration-response curves of the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding stimulation by selective agonists of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, 5-HT(1A) serotonin, mu-opioid, GABA(B), and cholinergic muscarinic receptors were performed in frontal cortical membranes from 28 suicide victims with major depression or bipolar disorder and 28 subjects who were matched for gender, age and postmortem delay. The receptor-independent [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding stimulation by mastoparan and the G-protein density were also examined. The alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding with the agonist UK14304 displayed a 4.6-fold greater sensitivity in suicide victims than in controls, without changes in the maximal stimulation. No significant differences were found in parameters of 5-HT(1A) serotonin receptor and other receptor-mediated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding stimulations. The receptor-independent activation of G-proteins was similar in both groups. Immunoreactive densities of G(alphai1/2)-, G(alphai3)-, G(alphao)-, and G(alphas)-proteins did not differ between suicide victims and controls. In conclusion, alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor sensitivity is increased in the frontal cortex of suicide victims with mood disorders. This receptor supersensitivity is not related to an increased amount or enhanced intrinsic activity of G-proteins. The new finding provides functional support to the involvement of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the pathogenesis of mood disorders.
A total of 24 aryl-substituted analogues of nicotine (1a) and two related series of nicotinic ligands, aminomethylpyridines 3 and ether analogues 8, were examined to determine if they bind at alpha4beta2 nACh receptors in a common manner. A modest correlation (r=0.785) was found between the affinities of the nicotine analogues and derivatives of 3, but little correlation (r=0.348) was found with analogues 8. However, a modest correlation (r=0.742) exists between the binding of analogues 3 and 8. It seems that 1-series and 8-series compounds bind differently but that the 3-series compounds share some intermediate binding similarity with both.
Adult Long-Evans male rats sustained injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the fimbria-fornix (2.5 microg/side) and the cingular bundle (1.5 microg/side) and/or to intraseptal injections of 192 IgG-saporin (0.4 microg/side) in order to deprive the hippocampus of its serotonergic and cholinergic innervations, respectively. Sham-operated rats were used as controls. The rats were tested for locomotor activity (postoperative days 18, 42 and 65), spontaneous T-maze alternation (days 20-29), beam-walking sensorimotor (days 34-38), water maze (days 53-64) and radial maze (days 80-133) performances. The cholinergic lesions, which decreased the hippocampal concentration of ACh by about 65%, induced nocturnal hyperlocomotion, reduced T-maze alternation, impaired reference-memory in the water maze and working-memory in the radial maze, but had no effect on beam-walking scores and working-memory in the water maze. The serotonergic lesions, which decreased the serotonergic innervation of the hippocampus by about 55%, failed to induce any behavioural deficit. In the group of rats given combined lesions, all deficits produced by the cholinergic lesions were observed, but the nocturnal hyperlocomotion and the working-memory deficits in the radial maze were attenuated significantly. These results suggest that attenuation of the serotonergic tone in the hippocampus may compensate for some dysfunctions subsequent to the loss of cholinergic hippocampal inputs. This observation is in close concordance with data showing that a reduction of the serotonergic tone, by pharmacological activation of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors on raphe neurons, attenuates the cognitive disturbances produced by the intrahippocampal infusion of the antimuscarinic drug, scopolamine. This work has been presented previously [Serotonin Club/Brain Research Bulletin conference, Serotonin: From Molecule to the Clinic (satellite to the Society for Neuroscience Meeting, New Orleans, USA, November 2-3, 2000)].
In this study, we characterized the glutamate- or second-messenger kinase-dependent internalization of the rat metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) splice variants 1a, 1b, and 1c, and assessed the arrestin and dynamin dependence of these processes. To facilitate this we inserted a hemagglutinin epitope tag in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the splice variants. Quantification of glutamate-induced mGluR1 splice variant internalization provided by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that each splice variant underwent rapid internalization, which was strongly inhibited by coexpression of dominant-negative mutant (DNM) arrestin or dynamin. In addition glutamate-induced rapid translocation of arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or arrestin-3-GFP from cytosol to membrane was observed in cells expressing mGluR1 splice variants. Glutamate-induced internalization of mGluR1a and mGluR1c was partially blocked by a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), 2-[1-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide (GF 109203X), whereas mGluR1b internalization was not significantly affected by this inhibitor. Similarly, inositol phosphate production after glutamate-induced activation of mGluR1a and mGluR1c was increased after PKC inhibition, whereas glutamate-induced mGluR1b stimulation was unaffected. Activation by carbachol of endogenously expressed M(1) muscarinic receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, induced the internalization of mGluR1 splice variants, which was partially blocked by pretreatment with inhibitors of either PKC or Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Expression of DNM-arrestin with mGluR1a or 1c strongly inhibited carbachol-induced internalization. However, coexpression of DNM-arrestin with mGluR1b was less effective in reducing carbachol-induced receptor internalization. In addition, arrestin-2-GFP or arrestin-3-GFP underwent significant carbachol-induced translocation from cytosol to membrane in cells coexpressing mGluR1a or 1c but not in cells coexpressing mGluR1b. This study demonstrates that the internalization of mGluR1 splice variants is subject to PKC and CaMKII regulation. In addition, regulation by these kinases confers differential arrestin dependence.
Sigma and 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation can increase acetylcholine (ACh) release in the brain. Because ACh release facilitates learning and memory, we evaluated the degree to which OPC-14523 (1-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-5-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2[1H]-quinolinone monomethane sulfonate), a novel sigma and 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, can augment ACh release and improve learning impairments in rats due to cholinergic- or age-related deficits. Single oral administration of OPC-14523 improved scopolamine-induced learning impairments in the passive-avoidance task and memory impairment in the Morris water maze. The chronic oral administration of OPC-14523 attenuated age-associated impairments of learning acquisition in the water maze and in the conditioned active-avoidance response test. OPC-14523 did not alter basal locomotion or inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at concentrations up to 100 microM and, unlike AChE inhibitors, did not cause peripheral cholinomimetic responses. ACh release in the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats increased after oral delivery of OPC-14523 and after local delivery of OPC-14523 into the hippocampus. The increases in hippocampal ACh release were blocked by the sigma receptor antagonist NE-100 (N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)-phenyl]-ethylamine). Thus, OPC-14523 improves scopolamine-induced and age-associated learning and memory impairments by enhancing ACh release, due to a stimulation of sigma and probably 5-HT(1A) receptors. Combined sigma/5-HT(1A) receptor agonism may be a novel approach to ameliorate cognitive disorders associated with age-associated cholinergic deficits.
We recently reported that cardiomyocytes could be differentiated from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vitro by 5-azacytidine treatment. In native cardiomyocytes, adrenergic and muscarinic receptors play crucial roles in mediating heart rate, conduction velocity, contractility, and cardiac hypertrophy. We investigated whether these receptors are expressed in differentiated CMG cells, and if so, whether they have downstream signaling systems.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that CMG cells had already expressed alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, and alpha(1D)-adrenergic receptor mRNA before 5-azacytidine treatment, whereas expression of beta(1)-, beta(2)-adrenergic and M(1)-, M(2)-muscarinic receptors was first detected at 1 day. Phenylephrine dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which was completely inhibited by prazosin, and significantly increased cell size. Isoproterenol augmented cAMP by 38-fold, which was fully inhibited by propranolol. Isoproterenol (10(-7) mol/L) increased the spontaneous beating rate by 47.6% (basal, 127+/-16 bpm), and propranolol and CGP20712A (beta(1)-selective blocker) reduced it by 79.0% and 71.0%, respectively, whereas ICI118551 (beta(2)-selective blocker) induced slight reduction. Cell motion, percent shortening, and contractile velocity were increased by 37.5%, 26.9%, and 50.6%, respectively, in response to isoproterenol. Phenylephrine and isoproterenol augmented ANP and BNP gene expressions. Carbachol increased IP(3) by 32-fold, which was markedly inhibited by atropine as well as AFDX116 (M(2)-selective blocker) measured by radioimmunoassay.
These findings indicate that CMG cells expressed alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D) receptors before differentiation and expressed beta(1), beta(2), M(1), and M(2) receptors after they obtained the cardiomyocyte phenotype. These receptors had functional signal transduction pathways and could modulate cell function.
Iloperidone is a novel psychotropic compound currently undergoing Phase III trials. Its affinity for human dopamine and 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors has been reported previously. This report presents the affinity of iloperidone for a largely extended number of human neurotransmitter receptors. In a few instances human receptors were not available and receptor studies were performed on tissues from laboratory animals. The present data, supplemented with those of, indicate that iloperidone displays high affinity (K(I) &lt; 10 nM) for norepinephrine alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, dopamine D(3) and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors. Intermediate affinity (10-100 nM) was found for norepinephrine alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors, dopamine D(2A) and D(4) receptors and serotonin 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(6) receptors. The affinity for all other receptors was below 100 nM, including norepinephrine alpha(2A), alpha(2B), beta(1), and beta(2), muscarine M(1)-M(5), histamine H(1), dopamine D(1) and D(5), CCK(A) and CCK(B), 5-HT(7), dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. Thus, iloperidone targets a selective set of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin receptor subtypes. The affinity for this particular set of receptors indicates that iloperidone has the potential to be a broad spectrum antipsychotic, with efficacy against positive, negative, depressive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and a low propensity to induce side effects.
Recent evidence indicates that stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors abates excitotoxic neuronal death. Here we investigated whether oral post-lesion administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (-)-(R)-2-[4-[[(3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-yl)methyl]amino]butyl]-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one 1,1-dioxide monohydrochloride (Repinotan HCl) attenuates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity (60 nmol/microl) in the rat magnocellular nucleus basalis. Repinotan HCl (1 mg/kg) was administered from day 1, 2, 3, or 6 post-surgery twice daily for five consecutive days. This delayed drug administration protocol was employed to investigate the initiation period during which 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists may significantly influence ongoing neurodegeneration processes. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg) served as reference compound. Twenty-four hours after drug delivery a small open-field test, while on day 14 post-surgery a passive avoidance test was performed. Effects of Repinotan HCl treatment on the survival of cholinergic magnocellular nucleus basalis neurons and their cortical projections were determined by quantitative acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) histochemistry. Moreover, AChE and ChAT activities were biochemically measured both in the cerebral cortex and in the magnocellular nucleus basalis. Repinotan HCl treatment markedly increased spontaneous activities in the small open-field at any time-point investigated. Improved memory performance was only demonstrated when Repinotan HCl was administered from day 1 post-lesion on wards. Repinotan HCl treatment from day 2 and 3 post-lesion on markedly attenuated both histochemical and neurochemical characteristics of NMDA excitotoxicity on cholinergic magnocellular nucleus basalis neurons and on their cortical projections. Whereas the neuroprotective profile of Repinotan HCl was superior to that of 8-OH-DPAT, oral administration of both 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists yielded largely equivalent behavioral recovery after NMDA infusion in the magnocellular nucleus basalis. In conclusion, the present data indicate the potent neuroprotective action of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist Repinotan HCl with a peak efficacy of delayed (2-3 day) post-lesion drug treatment in vivo. Post-lesion treatment with 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists may therefore be of significance in the intervention of neuronal damage associated with acute excitotoxic conditions.
The effect of metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists on KCl (20 mm)-induced endogenous acetylcholine release from rat striatal synaptosomes was investigated. The group I agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), 1-1000 nm, potentiated in a concentration-dependent way the KCl-induced acetylcholine release, reaching maximal efficacy at 100 nm (+93 +/- 14%). The effect of DHPG (10 nm) was counteracted by coapplication of (7-hydroximino)cyclopropan-b-chromen-1a-carboxylate (CPCCOEt), 10 microm, a metabotropic glutamate receptor type one selective antagonist, and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), 10 microm, a metabotropic glutamate receptor type five selective antagonist, but not by application of either antagonist alone. The group II agonist (2S, 1'R, 2'R, 3'R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV), 1-1000 nm, inhibited in a concentration-dependent way the KCl-induced acetylcholine release displaying maximal efficacy at 300 nm (-32 +/- 2%). The effect of DCG-IV 300 nm was counteracted by the group II selective antagonist (2S)-alpha-ethylglutamic acid (EGLU), 300 microm. The group III agonist L-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) failed to alter the KCl-induced acetycholine release up to 300 microm. We conclude that metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to group I and II are located on the axon terminals of striatal cholinergic interneurons, their activation resulting in facilitation and inhibition, respectively, of acetylcholine release.
In order to clarify the mechanism by which pGlu-Asn-Cys(Cys)-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH(2) (vasopressin-(4-9)), a major metabolite C-terminal fragment of [Arg(8)]-vasopressin (vasopressin-(1-9)), improves learning and memory, we used several different drugs such as an acetylcholine receptor antagonist, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor, vasopressin receptor antagonists and L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker to disrupt spatial memory in rats. Moreover, we examined the effect of vasopressin-(4-9) on acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus using microdialysis. Vasopressin-(4-9) (10 fg/brain, i.c.v.) improved the impairment of spatial memory in the eight-arm radial maze induced by scopolamine, pirenzepine and Ca(2+)/calmodulin -dependent protein kinase II inhibitor. Pirenzepine, a vasopressin V(1A) receptor antagonist, and L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, but not a vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonist, suppressed the effects of vasopressin-(4-9) on scopolamine-induced impairment of spatial memory. Moreover, vasopressin-(4-9) did not affect acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus of intact rats or of scopolamine-treated rats as assessed by microdialysis. These results suggest that vasopressin-(4-9) activates vasopressin V(1A) receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of cholinergic neurons, and induces a transient influx of intracellular Ca(2+) through L-type Ca(2+) channels to interact with muscarinic M(1) receptors. The activation of these processes by vasopressin-(4-9) is critically involved in the positive effect of vasopressin-(4-9) on scopolamine-induced impairment of spatial memory.
To determine whether neural pathways for controlling goblet cell secretion are present in mouse and human conjunctiva.
Mouse conjunctiva was homogenized and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting to detect PGP 9.5 (indicates nerves), muscarinic receptor subtypes (indicates parasympathetic pathway), and adrenergic receptors (indicates sympathetic pathway). Mouse eyes and human conjunctival tissue were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and muscarinic and alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes were used.
Western blot demonstrated PGP 9.5, M(1), M(2), and M(3) muscarinic receptors and alpha(1A)-, beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors in mouse conjunctiva. Immunoreactivity for VIP, TH, and DBH was found adjacent to mouse and human goblet cells. M(1) and M(2) muscarinic receptors were identified throughout mouse conjunctiva, but M(3) receptor was predominantly on goblet cells. All three muscarinic receptor subtypes were detected on goblet cells in human conjunctiva. alpha(1A)-Adrenergic receptors were found on epithelial cells and on goblet cells in mouse and human conjunctiva. beta(1)- and beta(2)-Adrenergic receptors were found on both epithelial and goblet cells in mouse conjunctiva, but not on human conjunctival cells. beta(3)-Adrenergic receptors were found on both epithelial and goblet cells in human conjunctiva but not on mouse conjunctival cells.
The following conclusions were drawn: parasympathetic nerves and M(1), M(2), and M(3) muscarinic receptors, as well as sympathetic nerves are present on mouse and human goblet cells. The adrenergic receptors beta(1) and beta(2,) but not alpha(1A) and beta(3) are present on mouse conjunctival goblet cells, whereas alpha(1A) and beta(3,) but not beta(1) and beta(2) are present on human conjunctival goblet cells, suggesting that these nerves and receptors could activate goblet cell secretion in mouse and humans.
The central and peripheral effects of a series of Oxotremorine/Oxotremorine-M derivatives, previously characterized as muscarinic agonists in isolated preparations, were investigated in in vivo experiments. The molecules were tested for their antinociceptive activity (formalin licking and acetic acid writhing tests) and for their ability to induce tremor in mice. Peripheral cholinergic effects such as salivation, bradycardia, hypotension and intestinal hypermotility were studied in anaesthetized rats. All of the acetylenic compounds acted as muscarinic analgesics displaying the same order of potency shown in in vitro studies. The Oxotremorine-like subset showed a clearer distinction between doses producing antinociception and doses exerting undesirable central/peripheral side effects compared to the Oxotremorine-M derivatives. The most promising profile was displayed by the isoxazolin-3-one Oxotremorine-like derivative (compound 1a), which was characterized by a wider therapeutic window than that of the parent molecule Oxotremorine. Indeed, it produced atropine-sensitive analgesia (ID50 about 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) in the absence of tremorogenic (EC50 2.73 mg/kg i.p.) and cardiovascular effects while lethality occurred only at higher doses (LD50 19 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggest that such a derivative could be a candidate for further development of selective muscarinic analgesics.
The design, synthesis, and evaluation of 3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropane (benztropine) analogues have provided potent and selective probes for the dopamine transporter. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) have been developed that contrast with those described for cocaine, despite significant structural similarity. Furthermore, behavioral evaluation of many of the benztropine analogues in animal models of cocaine abuse has suggested that these two classes of tropane-based dopamine uptake inhibitors have distinct pharmacological profiles. In general, the benztropine analogues do not demonstrate efficacious locomotor stimulation in mice, do not fully substitute for a cocaine discriminative stimulus, and are not appreciably self-administered in rhesus monkeys. These compounds are generally more potent than cocaine as dopamine uptake inhibitors in vitro, although their actions in vivo are not consistent with this action. These observations suggest that differing binding profiles at the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters as well as at muscarinic receptors might have significant impact on the pharmacological actions of these compounds. In addition, by varying the structures of the parent compounds and thereby modifying their physical properties, pharmacokinetics as well as pharmacodynamics will be directly affected. Therefore, in an attempt to systematically evaluate the impact of chemical modification on these actions, a series of N-substituted (H, CH3, allyl, benzyl, propylphenyl, and butylphenyl) analogues of 3'-chloro-, 4'-chloro-, and 4,4''-dichloro-3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropanes were synthesized. These compounds were evaluated for displacement, in rat tissue, of [3H]WIN 35,428 from the dopamine transporter, [3H]citalopram from the serotonin transporter, [3H]nisoxetine from the norepinephrine transporter, and [3H]pirenzepine from muscarinic m1 receptors. SARs were developed and compared to a series of N-substituted-3alpha-(bis-4'-fluorophenyl)methoxytropanes. The present SARs followed previously reported studies with the single exception of the N-butylphenyl substituent, which did not provide the high affinity binding in any of these three sets of analogues, as it did in the 4',4''-difluoro series. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the three parent ligands (1a, 2a, and 3a) were compared to that of 3alpha-(bis-4'-fluorophenyl)methoxytropane which provided supportive evidence toward the proposal that the combination of steric bulk in both the 3-position and the N-substituent, in this class of compounds, is not optimal for binding at the dopamine transporter. These studies provide binding profile data that can now be used to correlate with future behavioral analyses of these compounds and may provide insight into the kind of binding profile that might be targeted as a potential treatment for cocaine abuse.
Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are positively coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and are expressed in medium spiny neurons of rat striatum in vivo. By modifying intracellular activities, this group of mGluRs is involved in the regulation of gene expression important for neuroplasticity. To characterize the regulatory role of group I receptors in opioid peptide mRNA expression in vitro, primary cultures of striatal cells were prepared from neonatal day-1 rat pups. Cells were cultured in the presence of a mitotic inhibitor, cytosine arabinoside, which generated predominant neuronal cell cultures after 12-14 days in culture as demonstrated by dense immunostaining of more than 90% of cultured cells to a specific marker for neurons (microtubule-associated protein) but not for astroglial cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein). The vast majority of neurons (&gt;90%) were also verified as GABAergic neurons according to their positive immunoreactivity to GABA and glutamic acid decarboxylase-65/67 antibodies. A few large neurons (&lt;5%) showed high levels of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity, presumably cholinergic neurons. To confirm group I mGluR expression in cultured neurons, both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were performed, which detected moderate levels of mGluR1 and mGluR5 mRNAs and protein products in most neurons (&gt;70%), respectively. On this culture system, quantitative in situ hybridization was then performed to quantify changes in preprodynorphin (PPD) and preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA levels in response to mGluR stimulation. Acute incubation of a non-subgroup selective agonist, 1S,3R-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD), increased PPD and PPE mRNA levels in a concentration-dependent manner (176 and 189% over control for PPD and PPE after 100 microM ACPD incubation, respectively). Application of a selective group I agonist, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), produced much greater induction of either mRNA (285 and 289% over control for PPD and PPE after 100 microM DHPG incubation, respectively). Co-incubation of a selective group I antagonist, n-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC), blocked both ACPD- and DHPG-induced PPD/PPE expression. These data demonstrate the validity of a neuronal cell culture model for studying the molecular regulation of opioid gene expression in vitro. Selective activation of identified group I mGluRs facilitates constitutive expression of PPD and PPE mRNAs in cultured striatal neurons.
1. We studied the effects of low doses of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, on the impairment of spatial learning caused by scopolamine injected into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus of rats performing a two-platform spatial discrimination task. 2. Bilateral injections of 4 microg (in 1 microl) of scopolamine into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus 10 min before each training session impaired choice accuracy with no effect on choice latency and errors of omission. 3. Administered subcutaneously 20 min before each training session, 8-OH-DPAT 10 and 30 (but not 3) microg kg(-1) did not modify choice accuracy but prevented the impairment by intrahippocampal scopolamine. 4. Injection of 1.0 microg (in 0.5 microl) of WAY 100635, a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, into the dorsal raphe 5 min before scopolamine had no effect on choice accuracy and latency or errors of omission and did not modify the effect of scopolamine, but completely antagonized the effect of 10 and 30 microg kg(-1) 8-OH-DPAT on scopolamine-induced impairment of choice accuracy. 5. The results confirm previous findings that stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal raphe attenuates the deficit of spatial learning caused by blockade of cholinergic excitatory input on hippocampal pyramidal cells. 6. Drugs that stimulate presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors such as 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonists may be useful in the symptomatic treatment of human memory disturbances associated with loss of cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus.
Neurally evoked contractions and release of (3)H- acetylcholine (ACh) during electrical field stimulation were measured in rat urinary bladder strips. The alpha(1) agonist phenylephrine (PE, 2-8 microM) increased the amplitude of neurally evoked contractions, facilitated the release of ACh and increased the baseline tone of the bladder strips. The PE-induced facilitation of the contractions did not significantly change during a prolonged exposure to PE (120 min), whereas the PE-induced rise in baseline tone gradually decreased to 65% of the initial value. Low concentrations of specific alpha(1A) antagonists, 5-methyl urapidil (5-MU), REC15/2739 and WB-4101 competitively inhibited the facilitation of the neurally-evoked contractions (pA(2:) 8.77; 9.59 and 9.62, respectively), whereas higher concentrations of 5-MU (IC(50): 48 nM) were required to suppress the PE-rise in baseline. WB-4101 (100 microM) inhibited the PE-induced facilitation of ACh release. The irreversible alpha(1B) antagonist chloroethyl-clonidine (CEC, 10-50 microM) inhibited the PE-evoked rise in base line tone, but did not affect the PE-induced facilitation of the neurally evoked contractions nor the facilitation of ACh release. However, CEC increased the area and amplitude of the neurally-evoked contractions by 261+/-33 and 47.2+/-8.4%, respectively. Atropine significantly inhibited the CEC evoked increase in area and amplitude of the electrically evoked contractions (76.5+/-4.8 and 40.8+/-3%, respectively) indicating that CEC facilitated the cholinergic responses of the electrically stimulated bladder strips. It is concluded that alpha(1A) and CEC sensitive alpha(1B) and/or alpha(1D) adrenoceptors are expressed in the rat bladder in different locations. On the cholinergic nerve terminals alpha(1A) adrenoceptors mediate prejunctional facilitation, whereas postjunctional alpha(1B)/alpha(1D) adrenoceptors mediate smooth muscle contraction.
G(i) protein-coupled receptors such as the M(2) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and A(1) adenosine receptor have been shown to activate G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (GIRKs) via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in atrial myocytes and in many neuronal cells. Here we show that muscarinic M(2) receptors not only activate but also reversibly inhibit these K(+) currents when stimulated with agonist for up to 2 min. The M(2) mAChR-mediated inhibition of the channel was also observed when the channels were first activated by inclusion of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) in the pipette. Under these conditions the M(2) mAChR-induced inhibition was quasi-irreversible, suggesting a role for G proteins in the inhibitory process. In contrast, when GIRK currents were maximally activated by co-expressing exogenous Gbetagamma, the extent of acetylcholine (ACh)-induced inhibition was significantly reduced, suggesting competition between the receptor-mediated inhibition and the large pool of available Gbetagamma subunits. The signaling pathway that led to the ACh-induced inhibition of GIRK channels was unaffected by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Furthermore, the internalization and agonist-induced phosphorylation of M(2) mAChR was not required because a phosphorylation- and internalization-deficient mutant of the M(2) mAChR was as potent as the wild-type counterpart. Pharmacological agents modulating various protein kinases or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not affect the inhibition of GIRK currents. Furthermore, the signaling pathway that mediates GIRK current inhibition was found to be membrane-delimited because bath application of ACh did not inhibit GIRK channel activity in cell-attached patches. Other G protein-coupled receptors including M(4) mAChR and alpha(1A) adrenergic receptors also caused the inhibition, whereas other G protein-coupled receptors including A(1) and A(3) adenosine receptors and alpha(2A) and alpha(2C) adrenergic receptors could not induce the inhibition. The presented results suggest the existence of a novel signaling pathway that can be activated selectively by M(2) and M(4) mAChR but not by adenosine receptors and that involves non-pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins leading to an inhibition of Gbetagamma-activated GIRK currents in a membrane-delimited fashion.
The [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay represents a functional approach to assess the coupling between receptors and G-proteins. The optimal conditions for [35S]GTPgammaS binding to human brain homogenates were established in postmortem samples of prefrontal cortex. The influence of protein content, incubation time, GDP, Mg(2+), and NaCl concentrations on the [35S]GTPgammaS binding were assessed in the absence and presence of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK14304 5-bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine). In conditions of 50 microM GDP and 100 mM NaCl, UK14304 increased the apparent affinity of the specific [35S]GTPgammaS binding without changing the apparent density. Concentration-response curves to agonists of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, mu-opioid, 5-HT(1A), cholinergic muscarinic, and GABA(B) receptors displayed, in the presence of NaCl, maximal stimulations between 24% and 61% with EC(50) values in the micromolar range. Selective antagonists shifted to the right the agonist-induced stimulation curves. The G(i)/G(o)-protein alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide decreased basal [35S]GTPgammaS binding in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited the stimulation induced by the different agonists. In cortical sections, [35S]GTPgammaS binding to gray matter was stimulated by the agonist UK14304. The present study demonstrates that functional studies of the receptor coupling to G(i)/G(o)-proteins can be performed in postmortem human brain samples.
Smoking rates among depressed individuals is higher than among healthy subjects, and nicotine alleviates depressive symptoms. Nicotine increases serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity and facilitates serotonin and noradrenaline release. In mice, acute nicotine administration enhances the activity of antidepressants in the mouse forced swim (mFST) and tail suspension tests. Here, we investigated if this action of nicotine is also reflected in a chronic treatment regimen.
After chronic treatment with nicotine in the drinking water, mice were challenged with nicotine, duloxetine, citalopram, and reboxetine in the mFST. Additionally, 8-OH-DPAT- and clonidine-induced hypothermia was tested in vehicle- and nicotine-pretreated mice, as a measure of 5-HT(1A) and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor function, respectively. Finally, the effects on the brain expression levels of high- and low-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the transporters for serotonin (SERT) and noradrenaline (NET) were assessed using [(3)H]epibatidine, [(3)H]alpha-bungarotoxin, [(3)H]citalopram, and [(3)H]nisoxetine binding, respectively.
In the mFST, nicotine-pretreated mice did not show altered response to the nicotine challenge, but increased responses to all three antidepressants tested were observed when compared to mice that had been administered drinking water without nicotine. There was no change in hypothermic responses to 8-OH-DPAT or clonidine. [(3)H]epibatidine binding was significantly increased in all brain regions investigated; whereas, [(3)H]alpha-bungarotoxin, [(3)H]citalopram, and [(3)H]nisoxetine binding were not altered, indicating that chronic oral nicotine increases the expression and/or affinity of high-affinity nAChRs, but not low-affinity nAChRs, SERT, or NET.
It is suggested that the increased sensitivity to antidepressants after chronic nicotine exposure involves increased high-affinity nAChR-mediated neurotransmission.
To further understand the excitatory effects of motoneurons on spinal network function, we investigated the entrainment of disinhibited rhythms by ventral root (VR) stimulation in the neonatal mouse spinal cord. A brief train of stimuli applied to a VR triggered bursting reliably in 31/32 experiments. The same roots that entrained disinhibited bursting could also produce locomotor-like activity with a similar probability when the network was not disinhibited. The ability of VR stimulation to entrain the rhythm persisted in nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic antagonists but was blocked by the AMPAR antagonist NBQX. Bath application of the type I mGluR1 receptor antagonist CPCCOEt reduced the ability of both dorsal root and VR stimulation to entrain the disinhibited rhythm and abolished the ability of either type of stimulation to evoke locomotor-like activity. Calcium imaging through the lateral aspect of the cord revealed that VR stimulation and spontaneously occurring bursts were accompanied by a wave of activity that originated ventrally and propagated dorsally. Imaging the cut transverse face of L(5) revealed that the earliest VR-evoked optical activity began ventrolaterally. The optical activity accompanying spontaneous bursts could originate ventrolaterally, ventromedially, or throughout the mediolateral extent of the ventral horn or very occasionally dorsally. Collectively, our data indicate that VR stimulation can entrain disinhibited spinal network activity and trigger locomotor-like activity through a mechanism dependent on activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The effects of entrainment appear to be mediated by a ventrolaterally located network that is also active during spontaneously occurring bursts.
5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is one of the inhibitory mediators in the urinary bladder outlet region. Here we investigated mechanisms involved in 5-HT-induced relaxations of the pig bladder neck.
Urothelium-denuded strips of pig bladder were mounted in organ baths for isometric force recordings of responses to 5-HT and electrical field stimulation (EFS).
After phenylephrine-induced contraction, 5-HT and 5-HT receptor agonists concentration-dependently relaxed the preparations, with the potency order: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) &gt; 5-HT = RS67333 &gt; (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralinhydrobromide &gt; m-chlorophenylbiguanide &gt; alpha-methyl-5-HT &gt; ergotamine. 5-HT and 5-CT relaxations were reduced by the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist (2R)-1-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)sulphonyl]-2-[2-(4-methyl-1-piperidinyl)ethyl]pyrrolidine hydrochloride and potentiated by (S)-N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide dihydrochloride (WAY 100135) and cyanopindolol, 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonists respectively. Inhibitors of 5-HT(1B/1D), 5-HT(2), 5-HT(2B/2C), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(4), 5-HT(5A) and 5-HT(6) receptors failed to modify 5-HT responses. Blockade of monoamine oxidase A/B, noradrenergic neurotransmission, alpha-adrenoceptors, muscarinic and purinergic receptors, nitric oxide synthase, guanylate cyclase and prostanoid synthesis did not alter relaxations to 5-HT. Inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) and ATP-dependent K(+) channels failed to modify 5-HT responses but blockade of neuronal voltage-gated Na(+)-, Ca(2+)- and voltage-gated K(+) (K(v))-channels potentiated these relaxations. Adenylyl cyclase activation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibition potentiated and reduced, respectively, 5-HT-induced responses. Under non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic, non-nitrergic conditions, EFS induced neurogenic, frequency-dependent, relaxations which were resistant to WAY 100135 and cyanopindolol.
5-HT relaxed the pig urinary bladder neck through muscle 5-HT(7) receptors linked to the cAMP-PKA pathway. Prejunctional 5-HT(1A) receptors and K(v) channels modulated 5-HT-induced relaxations whereas postjunctional K(+) channels were not involved in such responses. 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists could be useful in the therapy of urinary incontinence produced by intrinsic sphincter deficiency.
The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is becoming a serious public health problem. The use of atypical antipsychotics has been associated with disruption of the glucose metabolism and therefore with causing DM. The underlying mechanisms are unknown, but knowledge of the differences between the pharmacological features of various antipsychotics combined with their diabetogenic profile might help us to understand those mechanisms. This article describes how the binding of various essential receptors or transporters in essential body tissues, adipose tissue, pancreatic tissue and liver and skeletal muscle tissue can cause disruption of the glucose metabolism. With such knowledge in mind one can try to explain the differences between the diabetogenic propensities of various antipsychotics. It is well known that clozapine and olanzapine cause weight gain and DM, whereas aripiprazole and ziprasidone have much less disruptive clinical profiles. The most significant risk factor for adiposity seems to be strong blocking of histaminergic receptors. An agonistic activity on serotonergic-1a receptors, with a very low affinity for muscarinergic-3 receptors, might protect against the development of DM. More data will become available which may help to solve the puzzle.
The pharmacological profile of PF-01354082, a selective 5-HT(4) receptor partial agonist, was investigated. PF-01354082 displayed high affinity for human 5-HT(4d) and dog 5-HT(4h) receptors in binding studies, having Ki values of 2.0 nM and 4.2 nM, respectively. By contrast, PF-01354082 did not show significant affinity for several other 5-HT receptors (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3A), and 5-HT(7)) or the dopamine D(2long) receptor. Functional assays using either cells expressing human recombinant 5-HT(4d) receptors or rat tunica muscularis mucosae demonstrated that PF-01354082 exhibited partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(4) receptor. The effects of PF-01354082 on in vitro receptor binding, ion channel activity, and sites of uptake were further investigated. PF-01354082 did not show biologically relevant binding activity at concentrations up to 10 microM except for binding to the 5-HT(4e) receptor. Furthermore, PF-01354082 decreased I(HERG) current by only 11% at a concentration of 300 microM, indicating that the compound had greater than 150,000-fold selectivity for the human 5-HT(4d) receptor over hERG channels. An in vivo study using a gastric motility model in conscious dogs demonstrated that oral administration of PF-01354082 resulted in marked and sustained stimulation of gastric motility in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that PF-01354082 is an orally active, highly selective, partial agonist of the human 5-HT(4) receptor that is expected to exert a favorable effect on gastrointestinal motor disorders with reduced adverse effects mediated by other related receptors.
The past decade of efforts to find improved treatment for major depression has been dominated by genome-driven programs of rational drug discovery directed toward highly selective ligands for nonmonoaminergic agents. Selective drugs may prove beneficial for specific symptoms, for certain patient subpopulations, or both. However, network analyses of the brain and its dysfunction suggest that agents with multiple and complementary modes of action are more likely to show broad-based efficacy against core and comorbid symptoms of depression. Strategies for improved multitarget exploitation of monoaminergic mechanisms include triple inhibitors of dopamine, serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline reuptake, and drugs interfering with feedback actions of monoamines at inhibitory 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B) and possibly 5-HT(5A) and 5-HT(7) receptors. Specific subsets of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors mediating antidepressant actions are under study (e.g., 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(6)). Association of a clinically characterized antidepressant mechanism with a nonmonoaminergic component of activity is an attractive strategy. For example, agomelatine (a melatonin agonist/5-HT(2C) antagonist) has clinically proven activity in major depression. Dual neurokinin(1) antagonists/5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and melanocortin(4) antagonists/SRIs should display advantages over their selective counterparts, and histamine H(3) antagonists/SRIs, GABA(B) antagonists/SRIs, glutamatergic/SRIs, and cholinergic agents/SRIs may counter the compromised cognitive function of depression. Finally, drugs that suppress 5-HT reuptake and blunt hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocorticotrophic axis overdrive, or that act at intracellular proteins such as GSK-3beta, may abrogate the negative effects of chronic stress on mood and neuronal integrity. This review discusses the discovery and development of dual- and triple-acting antidepressants, focusing on novel concepts and new drugs disclosed over the last 2 to 3 years.
Swimming in reduced electrophysiological preparations of the pteropod mollusc, Clione limacina, was blocked by bath application of hexamethonium even though pattern generator activity continued with this treatment. Neuromuscular recordings indicated that hexamethonium blocked synaptic input from Pd-3 and Pd-4 motoneurons to slow-twitch muscle cells, while connections from Pd-1A and Pd-2A motoneurons to fast-twitch muscle cells were variable in their response to hexamethonium-synaptic inputs were suppressed in most cases and occasionally blocked, but the latter only with high concentrations and long incubations. Acutely dissociated wing muscle cells showed a concentration-dependency in the percentage of contracted cells with bath application of acetylcholine, and this contractile activity was blocked in preparations that were first bathed in hexamethonium. Intracellular recordings from dissociated slow-twitch muscle cells showed conductance-increase depolarizations of approximately 20 mV following 1 s pressure ejections of 10(-4) M acetylcholine from micropipettes placed immediately adjacent to the muscle cells. These responses were blocked when hexamethonium was bath applied prior to the pressure-applied acetylcholine. The results suggest the Pd-3/Pd-4 motoneuron to slow-twitch muscle cell junctions are cholinergic with nicotinic-like receptors, while the Pd-1A/Pd-2A to fast-twitch muscle cell connections are likely cholinergic, but with a different receptor type.
The collagenous protein (ColQ) characterizes the collagen-tailed forms of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in vertebrate muscles. Two ColQ transcripts, ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a, driven by two distinct promoters are expressed differentially in mammalian slow- and fast-twitch muscles, respectively. Such expression patterns are determined by the contractile activity in different muscle fiber types. To reveal the regulatory role of muscular activity on ColQ expression, acetylcholine and nicotine were applied onto C2C12 muscle cells: the challenge increased the expression of ColQ-1/ColQ-1a mRNAs. The agonist challenge induced the phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). In parallel, over expression of an active mutant of CaMKII enhanced both ColQ-1/ColQ-1a mRNA levels in cultured C2C12 myotubes. Moreover, the over expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a downstream mediator of CaMKII, in the myotubes potentiated the CaMKII-induced ColQ expression. The current results reveal a signaling cascade that drives the expression profiles of ColQ in responding to activity challenge in cultured myotubes.
Blocking open ion channels provides a promising way to modulate synaptic transmission. Using the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor (AChR) as a test system, we seek to develop blockers that have blockade kinetics tunable via structural modifications. Here we investigate whether the blockade kinetics can be modulated by specifying the length of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer incorporated into the blocker. Single-channel electrophysiological experiments show that simple bis(trimethylammonium) compounds ( 1a- 3) both activate the AChR and block the open channel. The blockade kinetics are found to depend on spacer length: both the association and dissociation rate constants decrease with increasing spacer length. The decrease in the association rate constant can be quantitatively explained by the entropic cost of polymer confinement in the transmembrane lumen, while the decrease in the dissociation rate constant is consistent with weak, additive noncovalent interactions between the channel and the spacer. These results provide useful insights into the future design of kinetically tunable open-channel blockers for the AChR.
The developmental neurotoxicity of organophosphates such as chlorpyrifos (CPF) involves multiple mechanisms that ultimately compromise the function of specific neurotransmitter systems, notably acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT). Studies in mammalian models incorporate both direct effects on brain development and indirect effects mediated through maternal physiology and maternal/neonatal interactions. We examined the effects of CPF in an avian model, which does not share these potential confounds. Chick eggs were injected with CPF (10 or 20 mg/kg) on incubation days 2 and 6 and markers of ACh and 5HT systems were examined at hatching. The higher dose caused a reduction in cholinesterase activity but there was no consistent downregulation of m(2)-muscarinic ACh receptors as would have been expected from ACh hyperstimulation. Both doses evoked significant reductions in the presynaptic high-affinity choline transporter, the rate-limiting factor in ACh biosynthesis, as monitored by binding of hemicholinium-3. Choline acetyltransferase, a constitutive marker for ACh terminals, was unaffected. This suggests that CPF reduces ACh presynaptic activity rather than compromising the development of ACh projections per se. CPF exposure also reduced the expression of cerebrocortical 5HT(1A) receptors. These effects in the chick model recapitulate many of the actions of early gestational CPF exposure in rats, and thus suggest that CPF exerts direct actions on the immature brain to compromise the development of ACh and 5HT pathways.
The cardiogenic capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells has been well-investigated. However, little is known about the development of adrenoceptor (AR) systems during the process of ES cell differentiation, which are critically important in cardiac physiology and pharmacology. In this present study, we investigated the expression profile of adrenoceptor subtypes, beta-adrenergic modulation of muscarinic receptors and adrenoceptor-related signaling in cardiomyocytes derived from ES cells (ESCMs). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that undifferentiated mouse ES cells expressed alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)- and beta(2)-AR mRNA. However, beta(1)-AR was only expressed after vitamin C induction. The expressions of alpha(1A)-, alpha(1D)- and beta(1)-ARs increased significantly while alpha(1B)- and beta(2)-ARs showed no significant change during the differentiation process. Furthermore, we detected the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Both alpha(1)-AR and beta-AR could activate extracellular responsive kinase in ESCMs. Isoprenaline could inhibit the expression of M(2) muscarinic receptor protein. CGP20712A, a beta(1)-AR antagonist, up-regulated the expression of M(2) muscarinic receptor while ICI118551, a beta(2)-AR antagonist, showed no effect. These results indicated that functional adrenoceptors and tyrosine hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, were differentially expressed in ESCMs. Adrenoceptor-related signaling pathways and beta-adrenergic modulation of muscarinic receptors were established during differentiation.
Serotoninergic neurons in the central nervous system impinge on many other neurons and modulate their neurotransmitter release. This review focuses on 1) the function of presynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) heteroreceptors on axon terminals of central cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or GABAergic neurons and 2) the role of GABAergic interneurons expressing 5-HT heteroreceptors in the regulation of acetylcholine, dopamine, or noradrenaline release. In vitro studies on slices or synaptosomes and in vivo microdialysis experiments have shown that 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3), and/or 5-HT(4) heteroreceptors mediate this modulation. 5-HT(1B) receptors on neocortical cholinergic, striatal dopaminergic, or hippocampal GABAergic axon terminals are examples for release-inhibiting 5-HT heteroreceptors; 5-HT(3) receptors on hippocampal GABAergic or 5-HT(4) receptors on hippocampal cholinergic axon terminals are examples for release-facilitating 5-HT heteroreceptors. GABA released from GABAergic interneurons upon activation of facilitatory 5-HT receptors, e.g., 5-HT(2A) or 5-HT(3) receptors, mediates inhibition of the release of other neurotransmitters such as prefrontal neocortical dopamine or neocortical acetylcholine release, respectively. Conversely, attenuated GABA release in response to activation of inhibitory 5-HT heteroreceptors, e.g., 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptors on GABAergic interneurons is involved in paradoxical facilitation of hippocampal acetylcholine and striatal dopamine release, respectively. Such 5-HT heteroreceptors are considered potential targets for appropriate 5-HT receptor ligands which, by enhancing the release of a relevant neurotransmitter, can compensate for its hypothesized deficiency in distinct brain areas. Examples for such deficiencies are the impaired release of hippocampal or neocortical acetylcholine, striatal dopamine, and hippocampal or neocortical noradrenaline in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and major depression, respectively.
Antagonists at presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors increase endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) release and enhance cognition but little is known regarding their actions on plasticity at glutamatergic synapses. Here the mechanisms of the persistent enhancement of hippocampal excitatory transmission induced by the M2/M4 muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist methoctramine were investigated in vivo. The persistent facilitatory effect of i.c.v. methoctramine in the CA1 region of urethane-anesthetized rats was mimicked by gallamine, an M2 receptor antagonist, supporting a role for this receptor subtype. Neither the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists D-(-)-2-amino phosphonopentanoic acid (d-AP5) and memantine, nor the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1a antagonist (S)-(+)-alpha-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzeneacetic acid (LY367385) significantly affected the methoctramine-induced persistent synaptic enhancement, indicating a lack of requirement for these glutamate receptors. The selective kinase inhibitors Rp-adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS) and the myrostylated pseudosubstrate peptide, Myr-Ser-Ile-Tyr-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Arg-Arg-Trp-Arg-Lys-Leu-OH (ZIP), were used to investigate the roles of protein kinase A (PKA) and the atypical protein kinase C, protein kinase Mzeta (PKM zeta), respectively. Remarkably, pretreatment with either agent prevented the induction of the persistent synaptic enhancement by methoctramine and post-methoctramine treatment with Rp-cAMPS transiently reversed the enhancement. These findings are strong evidence that antagonism of M2 muscarinic ACh receptors in vivo induces an NMDA receptor-independent persistent synaptic enhancement that requires activation of both PKA and PKM zeta.
Changes in neuregulin 1 expression have been reported in the CNS from subjects with schizophrenia. As neuregulin 1 is important in cortical development we postulated that changes in neuregulin 1 expression may contribute towards changes in cholinergic, glutamatergic and serotonergic markers that are well documented in the CNS of subjects with that disorder. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used in situ radioligand binding to measure levels of muscarinic M1/M4 receptors, the kainate receptor, the NMDA receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor, the serotonin 1A receptor and the serotonin transporter in the CNS from heterozygous transmembrane domain neuregulin 1 mutant mice. The major outcomes from these studies was the demonstration of an overall increase in levels of the serotonin 2A receptor (F=11.3, d.f.=3,1,72, p=0.0012) and serotonin transporter (F=5.00, d.f.=1,3,72, p&lt;0.05) in the mutant mice. Levels of the other receptors did not vary in the mutant mice compared to their wild type-like litter mates. These data are the first evidence to suggest that NRG1 gene expression may be involved in regulating the development of the serotonergic system in the mammalian CNS.
Information is sparse on neurotransmitter deficiencies in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), in particular with reference to distinct histological subgroups and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
To evaluate in FTD with the major histologies, and compare with AD and controls, neurotransmission indices, as these may help in developing treatment.
Post-mortem grey matter from Brodmann Area 21, 9 and 7 of 51 brains was assayed for ten neurochemical parameters indexing neurotransmission. Repeated measures analyses of variance were carried out for each parameter comparing groups (FTD vs AD vs control) at each anatomical site.
In FTD only the indices of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid, serotonin (5-HT)(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were significantly reduced from control values. Of the ten parameters only 5-HT(1A) receptors showed significant group x site interaction. This reflected disproportionate reduction in frontal and temporal compared to parietal cortex. In FTD three other receptors (muscarinic, M(1), N-methyl-D: -aspartate, NMDA, and kainate), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content and 5-HT reuptake site values were not significantly reduced from control values. Only 5-HT, 5-HT reuptake site and ChAT values were significantly higher in FTD than AD. NMDA receptor and ChAT values were significantly reduced from control only in AD.
Neurochemical results in FTD indicate degeneration and loss of pyramidal neurones in frontotemporal neocortex, yet 5-HT afferents and 5-HT concentration, which are inhibitory on pyramidal neurones, were relatively preserved. This could lead to an excess of extraneural 5-HT causing underactivity of surviving pyramidal neurones. Pharmacotherapy with a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist may be indicated.
1. In the present study, we investigated how alloxan-induced diabetes affects the ability of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) to modulate bradycardia induced in vivo by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in pithed rats. We also analysed the type and/or subtype of 5-HT receptors involved. 2. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats with a single injection of alloxan (150 mg/kg, s.c.). Four weeks later, rats were anaesthetized, pretreated with atenolol and pithed. Electrical stimulation (3, 6 and 9 Hz) of the vagus nerve resulted in frequency dependent decreases in heart rate (HR). 3. In diabetic rats, intravenous bolus administration of high doses of 5-HT (100 and 200 microg/kg) increased the bradycardia induced by vagal electrical stimulation. Similarly, low doses (10 microg/kg) of the 5-HT(1/7) receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), increased vagally induced bradycardia. However, at high doses (50, 100 and 150 microg/kg), 5-CT reduced the bradycardia. Attenuation of the vagally induced bradycardia evoked by the higher doses of 5-CT was reproduced by L-694,247 (50 microg/kg), a selective agonist for the non-rodent 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors. Enhancement of the vagally induced bradycardia elicited by low doses of 5-CT was reproduced by the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxydipropylaminotretalin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; 50 microg/kg). These stimulatory and inhibitory actions on vagal stimulation-induced bradycardia in diabetic rats were also observed after administration of exogenous acetylcholine. 4. Vagally induced bradycardia in diabetic rats was not affected by administration of the selective 5-HT(2) receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT (150 microg/kg), the selective 5-HT(3) receptor agonist 1-phenylbiguanide (150 microg/kg) or the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist CGS-12066B (50 microg/kg). 5. Enhancement of the electrical stimulation-induced bradycardia in diabetic rats caused by 5-CT (10 microg/kg) or 8-OH-DPAT (50 microg/kg) was abolished by the selective 5-HT(2/7) receptor antagonist mesulergine (1 mg/kg) and the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 (100 microg/kg), respectively. Similarly, pretreatment with the non-selective 5-HT(1) receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.1 mg/kg) blocked the inhibitory effect of 5-CT (50 microg/kg) on the bradycardia induced by vagal electrical stimulation in diabetic rats. BRL-15572 (2 microg/kg), a selective 5-HT(1D) receptor antagonist, inhibited the action of L-694,247 (50 microg/kg), a selective agonist for the non-rodent 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors, on the vagally induced bradycardia. 6. In conclusion, in the present study, experimental diabetes evoked changes in both the nature and 5-HT receptor types/subtypes involved in vagally induced bradycardia.
Invertebrate visual iG(q)alpha is homologous to mammalian mG(q)alpha in two of the three domains important for G protein interaction with receptors; the C-terminus and the linker regions that connect the helical and ras-like domains of the alpha subunit. The third receptor-interacting domain, the N-terminus, contains a six amino acid extension MTLESI in mG(q)alpha that is not present in iG(q)alpha. In co-expression studies we assessed the promiscuity and efficacy of receptor coupling to phospholipase C (PLC) by iG(q)alpha, a non-palmitoylated mutant iG(q)alpha(C3,4A), mG(q)alpha and G(15)alpha. The invertebrate G proteins and mG(q)alpha only coupled to G(q)-coupled receptors (m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mChR1), alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor (alpha1-AR)) and not to the G(i/s)-coupled receptors (CCR1 receptor, beta2-adrenergic receptor or dopamine D1 receptor) while G(15)alpha coupled to all receptors. iG(q)alpha and iG(q)alpha(C3,4A) both had double the efficacy for PLC activation compared to the mammalian G proteins when co-expressed with mChR1 and alpha1-AR. The increased efficacy of iG(q)alpha compared to mG(q)alpha was also seen downstream of PLC with carbachol stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK1/2. Addition of the MTLESI extension onto the N-terminus of iG(q)alpha decreased its efficacy by 35% whereas deletion of this sequence from mG(q)alpha increased its efficacy by 60% in the PLC and ERK1/2 assays. iG(q)alpha, iG(q)alpha(C3,4A) and mG(q)alpha all displayed similar receptor-independent AlF(4)(-)activation of PLC and guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis (GTPase) activity. iG(q)alpha, and iG(q)alpha(C3,4A) both had increased receptor-activated guanosine 5'-[gamma-[(35)S]thio]triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding when compared to mG(q)alpha when co-expressed with the mChR1. These results demonstrate that G(q) protein efficacy is at least partially determined by the presence of the amino-terminal MTLESI extension. Comparison of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding rates helps explain the increased efficacy of the invertebrate G proteins.
The D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist, D(4) receptor partial agonist, and high efficacy 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist F15063 was shown to be highly efficacious and potent in rodent models of activity against positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However F15063 induced neither catalepsy nor the 'serotonin syndrome'. Here, we evaluated its profile in rat models predictive of efficacy against negative symptoms/cognitive deficits of schizophrenia.
F15063, given i.p., was assessed in models of behavioural deficits induced by interference with the NMDA/glutamatergic (phencyclidine: PCP) or cholinergic (scopolamine) systems.
Through 5-HT(1A) activation, F15063 partially alleviated (MED: 0.04 mg kg(-1)) PCP-induced social interaction deficit between two adult rats, without effect by itself, underlining its potential to combat negative symptoms. At doses above 0.16 mg kg(-1), F15063 reduced interaction by itself. F15063 (0.16 mg kg(-1)) selectively re-established PCP-impaired 'cognitive flexibility' in a reversal learning task, suggesting potential against adaptability deficits. F15063 (0.04-0.63 mg kg(-1)) also reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia in a juvenile-adult rat social recognition test, indicative of a pro-cholinergic influence. Activity in this latter test is consistent with its D(4) partial agonism, as it was blocked by the D(4) antagonist L745,870. Finally, F15063 up to 40 mg kg(-1) did not disrupt basal prepulse inhibition of startle reflex in rats, a marker of sensorimotor gating.
The balance of D(2)/D(3), D(4) and 5-HT(1A) receptor interactions of F15063 yields a promising profile of activity in models of cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Evidence from invertebrates to human studies indicates that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system modulates short- (STM) and long-term memory (LTM). This work is primarily focused on analyzing the contribution of 5-HT, cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors as well as protein synthesis to STM and LTM of an autoshaping learning task. It was observed that the inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis or new mRNA did not produce a significant effect on autoshaping STM performance but it did impair LTM. Both non-contingent protein inhibition and 5-HT depletion showed no effects. It was basically the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist cyproheptadine, which facilitated STM. However, the blockade of glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission impaired STM. In contrast, the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist SB-224289 facilitated both STM and LTM. Selective receptor antagonists for the 5-HT(1A) (WAY100635), 5-HT(1D) (GR127935), 5-HT(2A) (MDL100907), 5-HT(2C/2B) (SB-200646), 5-HT(3) (ondansetron) or 5-HT(4) (GR125487), 5-HT(6) (Ro 04-6790, SB-399885 and SB-35713) or 5-HT(7) (SB-269970) did not impact STM. Nevertheless, WAY100635, MDL100907, SB-200646, GR125487, Ro 04-6790, SB-399885 or SB-357134 facilitated LTM. Notably, some of these changes shown to be independent of food-intake. Concomitantly, these data indicate that '5-HT tone via 5-HT(1B) receptors' might function in a serial manner from STM to LTM, whereas working in parallel using 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B/2C), 5-HT(4), or 5-HT(6) receptors.
A series of methyllycaconitine (1a, MLA) analogs was synthesized where the (S)-2-methylsuccinimidobenzoyl group in MLA was replaced with a (R)-2-methyl, 2,2-dimethyl-, 2,3-dimethyl, 2-phenyl-, and 2-cyclohexylsuccinimidobenzoyl (1b-f) group. The analogs 1b-f were evaluated for their inhibition of [(125)I]iodo-MLA binding at rat brain alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). In order to determine selectivity, MLA and the analogs 1b-f were evaluated for inhibition of binding to rat brain alpha,beta nAChR using [(3)H]epibatidine. At the alpha7 nAChR, MLA showed a K(i) value of 0.87 nM, analogs 1b-e possessed K(i) values of 1.67-2.16 nM, and 1f showed a K(i) value of 26.8 nM. Surprisingly, the analog 1e containing the large phenyl substituent (K(i)=1.67 nM) possessed the highest affinity. None of the compounds possessed appreciable affinity for alpha,beta nAChRs. MLA antagonized nicotine-induced seizures with an AD(50)=2 mg/kg. None of the MLA analogs were as potent as MLA in this assay. MLA and all of the MLA analogs, with the exception of 1b, antagonized nicotine's antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick assay. Compound 1c (K(i)=1.78 nM at alpha7 nAChR) with an AD(50) value of 1.8 mg/kg was 6.7 times more potent than MLA (AD(50)=12 mg/kg) in antagonizing nicotine's antinociceptive effects but was 5-fold less potent than MLA in blocking nicotine-induced seizures. Since MLA has been reported to show neuroprotection against beta-amyloid(1-42), these new analogs which have high alpha7 nAChR affinity and good selectivity relative to alpha,beta nAChRs will be useful biological tools for studying the effects of alpha7 nAChR antagonist and neuroprotection.
Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia differs from cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative illnesses because it is associated with neuronal dysfunction and not neurodegeneration. Pharmacologically, potential targets for developing treatments may differ from cognition in dementing disorders. Several putative molecular targets for treating cognition in schizophrenia show promise, such as treatments that act on the D(1) receptor of the dopamine system; the 5HT(1A), 5HT(2A), and 5HT(6), receptors of the serotonin system; and ampakines, Glycine/D-cycloserine, D-serine, and mGluR 2/3 agonists of the glutamatergic system. Other receptors associated with improvement in cognition include nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, and the alphalpha2 subunit receptor of the brain GABA system. Domain treatment of schizophrenia is a new method of treating schizophrenia that involves treating a single domain of dysfunction at a time.
Nicotine is a neuroteratogen that disrupts neurodevelopment and synaptic function, with vulnerability extending into adolescence. We assessed the permanence of effects in rats on indices of neural cell number and size, and on acetylcholine and serotonin (5HT) systems, conducting assessments at 6 months of age, after prenatal nicotine exposure, adolescent exposure, or sequential exposure in both periods. For prenatal nicotine, indices of cell number and size showed few abnormalities by 6 months, but there were persistent deficits in cerebrocortical choline acetyltransferase activity and hemicholinium-3 binding to the presynaptic choline transporter, a pattern consistent with cholinergic hypoactivity; these effects were more prominent in males than females. The expression of 5HT receptors also showed permanent effects in males, with suppression of the 5HT(1A) subtype and upregulation of 5HT(2) receptors. In addition, cell signaling through adenylyl cyclase showed heterologous uncoupling of neurotransmitter responses. Nicotine exposure in adolescence produced lasting effects that were similar to those of prenatal nicotine. However, when animals were exposed to prenatal nicotine and received nicotine subsequently in adolescence, the adverse effects then extended to females, whereas the net effect in males was similar to that of prenatal nicotine by itself. Our results indicate that prenatal or adolescent nicotine exposure evoke permanent changes in synaptic function that transcend the recovery of less-sensitive indices of structural damage; further, prenatal exposure sensitizes females to the subsequent adverse effects of adolescent nicotine, thus creating a population that may be especially vulnerable to the lasting behavioral consequences of nicotine intake in adolescence.
Ghrelin is a recently described acylated peptide, which works as a somatosecretagogue and has described effects on the smooth, skeletal and cardiac muscle. We examined the production and effects of ghrelin on relaxation of the iris muscles. Contractile effects of 1-5 human ghrelin (frGhr, 10(-9)-6 x 10(-5)M) and 1-5 human des-octanoyl-ghrelin (d-frGhr; 10(-9)-6 x 10(-5)M) were tested on iris rabbit sphincter (n=11 frGhr; n=7 d-frGhr), dilator (n=6 frGhr; n=6 d-frGhr) and rat sphincter (n=6 frGhr; n=8 d-frGhr) precontracted muscles. On rabbit sphincter the effect of frGhr was also tested in presence of: i) L-NA (10(-5)M; n=7); ii) indomethacin (10(-5)M; n=7); iii) DLys(3)GHRP6 (10(-4)M; n=6); and iv) apamin+carybdotoxin (10(-6)M; n=6). Furthermore, on rabbit dilator the effect of frGhr was tested in presence of DLys(3)GHRP6 (10(-4)M; n=7). Finally, ghrelin mRNA production was assessed by "in situ" hybridization in Wistar rat eyes (n=8). In all muscles, frGhr promoted a concentration-dependent relaxation, maximal at 6 x 10(-5)M, 1.5-3 min after its addition, decreasing tension by 34.1+/-12.1%, 25.8+/-4.8% and 52.1+/-10.3% in the rabbit sphincter, dilator and rat sphincter, respectively. In the rabbit sphincter the relaxing effects of frGhr were: (i) enhanced in presence of DLys(3)GHRP6 (118.1+/-21.1%); (ii) blunted by indomethacin; and (iii) not altered by apamin+carybdotoxin (36.4+/-14.4%) or L-NA (52.4+/-11.4%). Relaxing effects of d-frGhr in rabbit (43.3+/-5.2%) and rat (77.1+/-15.3%) sphincter muscles were similar to those of frGhr. In rabbit dilator muscle, d-frGhr did not significantly alter active tension and the relaxing effect of frGhr was blunted by GHSR-1a blockage. Ghrelin mRNA was identified in iris posterior epithelium. In conclusion, ghrelin is a novel, locally produced, relaxing agent of iris dilator and sphincter muscles, an effect that is mediated by GHSR-1a in the former, but not in the latter. Furthermore, in the sphincter it seems to be mediated by prostaglandins, but not by NO or K(Ca) channels.
Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) elicited in the frontal or occipital pole of the intact cerebral cortex preparation of the newborn mouse (P0-P3) a transient oscillatory field potential activity in the frequency range of 11-14Hz. These oscillations propagated over the whole cortical hemisphere and were blocked by tetrodotoxin, indicating that action potentials are required for the generation of this activity. Blockade of GABA-A receptors with gabazine did not influence the ACPD-induced network activity, but the glycine antagonist strychnine caused a significant decrease in the frequency, amplitude and duration of the oscillations. Bath application of kynurenic acid, the AMPA/kainate antagonist CNQX or the NMDA antagonist CPP induced a significant reduction in the response amplitude by 15-18%, indicating that ionotropic glutamate receptors are involved in this network activity. The selective mGluR-1a antagonist LY367385 and the mGluR-5 antagonist MPEP reversibly blocked the field potential oscillations, whereas the group II mGluR antagonist LY341495 did not block the activity. The network oscillations were also blocked by the gap junction inhibitors carbenoxolone and quinidine. These data indicate that ACPD-induced oscillatory network activity in the neonatal mouse cerebral cortex depends on action potential discharge, activation of group I mGluRs of type 1a and type 5 and intact gap junctional coupling. We suggest that this propagating large-scale network activity may play an important role in the functional formation of early neocortical circuits.
The use of human prokinetic drugs in colic horses leads to inconsistent results. This might be related to differences in gastrointestinal receptor populations. The motor effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) on the equine mid-jejunum were therefore studied. Longitudinal muscle preparations were set up for isotonic measurement. 5-HT induced tonic contractions with superimposed phasic activity; these responses were not influenced by tetrodotoxin and atropine, suggesting a non-neurogenic, non-cholinergic pathway. The 5-HT receptor antagonists GR 127935 (5-HT(1B,D)), ketanserin (5-HT(2A)), SB 204741 (5-HT(2B)), RS 102221 (5-HT(2C)), granisetron (5-HT(3)), GR 113808 (5-HT(4)) and SB 269970 (5-HT(7)) had no influence on the 5-HT-induced response; the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists NAN 190 (pK(b)=8.13+/-0.06) and WAY 100635 (pK(b)=8.69+/-0.07), and the 5-HT(1,2,5,6,7) receptor antagonist methysergide concentration-dependently inhibited the 5-HT-induced contractile response. The 5-HT(1,7) receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) induced a contractile response similar to that of 5-HT; its effect was not influenced by tetrodotoxin and atropine, and SB 269970, but antagonised by WAY 100635. 8-OHDPAT, buspiron and flesinoxan, which are active at rat and human 5-HT(1A) receptors, had no contractile influence. These results suggest that the contractile effect of 5-HT in equine jejunal longitudinal muscle is due to interaction with muscular 5-HT receptors, which cannot be characterised between the actually known classes of 5-HT receptors.
The ascending brainstem transmitter acetylcholine depolarizes thalamocortical relay neurons while it induces hyperpolarization in local circuit inhibitory interneurons. Sustained K+ currents are modulated in thalamic neurons to control their activity modes; for the interneurons the molecular nature of the underlying ion channels is as yet unknown. Activation of TASK-1 K+ channels results in hyperpolarization of interneurons and suppression of their action potential firing. The modulation cascade involves a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src. The present study identifies a novel pathway for the activation of TASK-1 channels in CNS neurons that resembles cholinergic signalling and TASK-1 current modulation during hypoxia in smooth muscle cells.
The dorsal part of the lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is the main thalamic site for state-dependent transmission of visual information. Non-retinal inputs from the ascending arousal system and inhibition provided by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic local circuit interneurons (INs) control neuronal activity within the dLGN. In particular, acetylcholine (ACh) depolarizes thalamocortical relay neurons by inhibiting two-pore domain potassium (K2P ) channels. Conversely, ACh also hyperpolarizes INs via an as-yet-unknown mechanism. By using whole cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices and appropriate pharmacological tools we here report that stimulation of type 2 muscarinic ACh receptors induces IN hyperpolarization by recruiting the G-protein βγ subunit (Gβγ), class-1A phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and cellular and sarcoma (c-Src) tyrosine kinase, leading to activation of two-pore domain weakly inwardly rectifying K+ channel (TWIK)-related acid-sensitive K+ (TASK)-1 channels. The latter was confirmed by the use of TASK-1-deficient mice. Furthermore inhibition of phospholipase Cβ as well as an increase in the intracellular level of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate facilitated the muscarinic effect. Our results have uncovered a previously unknown role of c-Src tyrosine kinase in regulating IN function in the brain and identified a novel mechanism by which TASK-1 channels are activated in neurons.
Numerous studies have revealed that median raphe nuclei stimulation induces desynchronization of hippocampal field activity in vivo. Some findings provide evidence for tonic regulation of the theta oscillation of the septo-hippocampal system via the serotonergic system. To date the involvement of serotonergic transmission in theta rhythm generation in hippocampal slices has never been investigated. Thus the aim of the present study was to test whether HPC in vitro preparation is capable of producing theta in the presence of compounds modulating the activity of 5-HT1A receptors. To achieve this a series of experiments designed to determine the effect of different concentrations of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (S)WAY 100135 on HPC field activity was carried out. The dominant field potential pattern recorded within HPC slices was epileptiform activity, with a maximum frequency ranging from 0.19 ± 0.06 Hz to 0.69 ± 0.10 Hz. In addition, after the bath application of (S)WAY 100135 in concentrations 3 and 10 µM rhythmic epochs in the theta frequency range were also noted. The highest probability of theta rhythm production was observed after the bath perfusion with a solution of (S) WAY 100135 at a concentration of 10 μM. These theta rhythm epochs were characterized by a higher-than-average amplitude compared to carbachol-induced theta epochs and shorter time duration, with no apparent differences in the average frequency and duration of intervals between theta epochs. These results obtained herein of in vitro studies provide direct evidence for the involvement of serotonergic receptors in the depression of oscillatory activity in the HPC theta band.
The non-neuronal acetylcholine system (NNAS) in endothelial cells participates in modulating endothelial function, vascular tone, angiogenesis and inflammation, thus plays a critical role in cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to study potential downstream receptor-effectors of NNAS that were involved in regulating cellular function in endothelial cells.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated in the presence of acetylcholine, oxotremorine, pilocarpine or nicotine at the concentration of 10 μmol/L for 12 h, and the expressed proteins in the cells were separated and identified with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and LC-MS. The protein spots with the largest changes were identified by LC-MS. Biowork software was used for database search of the peptide mass fingerprints.
Over 1200 polypeptides were reproducibly detected in 2-DE with a pH range of 3-10. Acetylcholine, oxotremorine, pilocarpine and nicotine treatment caused 16, 9, 8 and 9 protein spots, respectively, expressed differentially. Four protein spots were identified as destrin, FK506 binding protein 1A (FKBP1A), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and profilin-1. Western blotting analyses showed that treatment of the cells with cholinergic agonists significantly decreased the expression of destrin, FKBP1A and MIF, and increased the expression of profilin-1.
A set of proteins differentially expressed in endothelial cells in response to cholinergic agonists may have important implications for the downstream biological effects of NNAS.
The present study was designed to investigate possible involvement of the central amygdala (CeA) nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the reversal effect of nicotine and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) on morphine-induced amnesia. Two guide cannulas were stereotaxically implanted in the CeA regions and a step-through passive avoidance task was used for the assessment of memory retrieval in adult male Wistar rats. Our results indicated that post-training s.c. administration of morphine (3-7-mg/kg) impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test administration of nicotine (0.3- and 0.5-mg/kg, s.c.) reversed morphine-induced amnesia. In addition, pre-test intra-CeA injection of MDMA (1-2-μg/rat) with an ineffective dose of nicotine (0.1-mg/kg, s.c.) improved memory retrieval, suggesting the interactive effect of the drugs on memory formation. It should be noted that that pre-test intra-CeA injection of 2-μg/rat of MDMA by itself produced amnesia. Interestingly, pre-test intra-CeA injection of mecamylamine, a nACh receptor antagonist (1-2-μg/rat) or (S)-WAY 100135 (0.25-1-μg/rat), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist inhibited the improvement of morphine-induced amnesia which was produced by pre-test co-injection of nicotine and MDMA. Pre-test intra-CeA injection of the same doses of MDMA, mecamylamine or (S)-WAY 100135 by itself had no effect on morphine-induced amnesia. Moreover, pre-test injection of the same doses of mecamylamine or (S)-WAY 100135 into the CeA alone could not change memory retrieval. Taken together, it can be concluded that there is a functional interaction between morphine, nicotine and MDMA via the CeA nicotinic and serotonergic receptor mechanisms in passive avoidance memory retrieval. Moreover, cross state-dependent memory retrieval may have been induced between the drugs and this probably depends on the rewarding effects of the drugs.
The in vivo study of receptor binding potential in the human brain is made possible by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Here we review PET studies of neuroreceptor function in mood disorders - specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). We concentrate on the most widely studied receptors of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Specifically, the serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)), serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)), serotonin 1B (5-HT(1B)), dopamine 1 (D1), and dopamine 2/3 (D2/3) receptors. We also review PET studies of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), the dopamine transporter (DAT), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and the muscarinic 2 receptor (M2). On the basis of the PET literature as well as supporting genetic studies, postmortem data, and preclinical models of depression, and several models of how monoaminergic function is altered in mood disorders are discussed with respect to inflammation, endocrine dysfunction, depression subtypes, and altered neurocircuitry.
The effects of the HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAD-299 on extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) and glutamate (Glu) levels in the frontal cortex (FC) and ventral hippocampus (HPC) of the awake rats were investigated by the use of in vivo microdialysis. Systemic administration of NAD-299 (0.3; 1 and 3micromol/kg s.c.) caused a dose-dependent increase in ACh levels in FC and HPC (peak value of 209% and 221%, respectively) and this effect was comparable to that induced by donepezil (2.63micromol/kg s.c.). Moreover, the ACh levels in the FC increased even after repeated (14days) treatment with NAD-299 and when NAD-299 was injected locally into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis or perfused through the microdialysis probe implanted in the cortex. In contrast, NAD-299 failed to alter the extracellular levels of glutamate after systemic (3micromol/kg s.c.) or local (100microM) administration. The present data support the hypothesis that cholinergic transmission in cortico-limbic regions can be enhanced via blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, which may underlie the proposed cognitive enhancing properties of NAD-299 in models characterized by cholinergic deficit.
We tested the hypothesis that single and repeated immobilization stress affect densities of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (alpha(1)-AR) and beta-AR subtypes, muscarinic receptors (MR), adenylyl cyclase activity (AC) and phospholipase C activity (PLC) in lungs of male and female wild type (WT) and corticotropin-releasing hormone gene (CRH-knockout (KO)) disrupted mice. We found sex differences in the basal levels of alpha(1)-AR subtypes (females had 2-3 times higher density of receptors than males) and MR (males had twice the density found in females). In marked contrast, beta-AR subtype densities did not differ between sexes. CRH gene disruption decreased all three studied receptors in intact mice (to 20-50% of WT) in both sexes (except beta(1)-AR in females). Stress induced sexually dimorphic responses, while all alpha(1)-AR subtypes decreased in females (to 30% of control approximately), only alpha(1A)-AR level diminished (about 50%) in males. beta(1)-AR decreased in males (to about 40%) but remained stable in females. beta(2)-AR diminished in females (to about 20-60%) and also in males (to about 30-60%). MR decreased in both sexes (approximately to 50%). AC activity diminished in males (to &lt; 50%) while PLC activity was not changed. In CRH-KO mice, the stress response was severely diminished. Paradoxically, the receptor response to stress was less affected by CRH-KO in males than in females. AC activity did not change in CRH-KO mice. In conclusion, in mice the stress reaction is sexually dimorphic and an intact hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical system is required for the normal reaction of pulmonary adrenergic and MR to stress.
In the search of new therapeutical strategies against non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the identification of new prognostic factors is crucial.
In this study, we analyzed the prognostic value of the liver X receptor-alpha (LXR-alpha), a nuclear receptor of a family of cholesterol derivatives called oxysterols, in patients with radically resected NSCLC.
We retrospectively reviewed 140 stage II and III surgically treated NSCLC patients that were grouped by percentage of LXR-alpha-positive cells value above or below its median value. Tumor-related survival was evaluated as primary end point.
The 5-year overall and tumor-related survival rates were 40% and 46%, respectively. The median percentage of LXR-alpha-positive cells was 20%. Patients with stage II NSCLC had higher LXR-alpha values than those with stage III (P = .04). Univariate analysis demonstrated that both TNM stage and LXR-alpha were significantly related to tumor-related survival (P = .006 and P = .004, respectively). The 5-year tumor-related survival rates in stage II and III NSCLC were 56% and 34%, respectively. The 5-year tumor-related survival rates in high and low LXR-alpha value were 57% and 32%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that both TNM stage and LXR-alpha were independent prognostic factors (P = .01 and P = .007, respectively) with hazard ratio of 1.92 and 0.49, respectively.
LXR-alpha seems to be an independent prognostic factor indicating a better survival in completely resected stage II and III NSCLC patients.
At least with regard to promotion and progression of cancer, oxysterols actually appear as typical Janus molecules, by inducing early inflammatory reaction against cancer expansion and apoptotic death of cancer cells, but on the other hand sustaining a complex survival signaling pathway that eventually turns in favor of the neoplastic process itself. The pro-tumoral and anti-tumoral properties of this class of compounds is mediated by both LXR-dependent and independent mechanisms. The extent of oxidative redox imbalance, moderate or extensive, likely plays a key role in determining the actual effects operated by oxysterols along the various steps of carcinogenesis.
Oxysterols are cholesterol-oxygenated derivatives generated in the organism and also present in foods because of cholesterol oxidation during processing and storage. They are the natural ligands of liver X receptors (LXRs) and are generally recognized as hypocholesterolemic and anti-inflammatory molecules although this latter property is still controversial. Most oxysterol studies have been performed in macrophages, whereas the effects of oxysterols in neutrophils are poorly known. In this study, human neutrophils were exposed to two different oxysterols, 7-keto-cholesterol (7-k-chol) and 25-hydroxy-cholesterol (25-OH-chol), and their possible participation in inflammatory process was evaluated.
Human neutrophils were incubated with 7-k-chol and 25-OH-chol, and ROS production, translocation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic components, hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and lysozyme secretion were analyzed.
An increase in ROS production was observed within a short period of time (minutes) with both molecules. These oxysterols also stimulated the cellular membrane translocation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox. On the other hand, HO-1 expression, a cytoprotector enzyme, is inhibited in human neutrophils upon oxysterols treatment. Moreover, both oxysterols were associated with high lysozyme enzyme secretion at 5 and 18 h of incubation.
The present paper describes for the first time that two oxysterols (7-k-chol and 25-OH-chol) enhance the ROS production within a short period of time in human neutrophils, stimulate the translocation of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase to the cellular membrane and increase lysozyme secretion. These data suggest that both oxysterols are able to activate pro-inflammatory effects in human neutrophils which contrasts with the role assigned to the oxysterols when they act through LXR at long time of incubation.
Macrophages play a crucial role in atherosclerosis progression. Classically activated M1 macrophages have been found in rupture-prone atherosclerotic plaques whereas alternatively activated macrophages, M2, localize in stable plaque. Macrophage accumulation of cholesterol and of its oxidized derivatives (oxysterols) leads to the formation of foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. In this study, the effects of oxysterols in determining the functional polarization of human macrophages were investigated. Monocytes, purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors, were differentiated into macrophages (M0) and treated with an oxysterol mixture, cholesterol, or ethanol, every 4 H for a total of 4, 8, and 12 H. The administration of the compounds was repeated in order to maintain the levels of oxysterols constant throughout the treatment. Compared with ethanol treatment, the oxysterol mixture decreased the surface expression of CD36 and CD204 scavenger receptors and reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species whereas it did not affect either cell viability or matrix metalloprotease-9 activity. Moreover, the oxysterol mixture increased the expression of both liver X receptor α and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1. An enhanced secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 accompanied these events. The results supported the hypothesis that the constant levels of oxysterols and, in particular, of 27-hydroxycholesterol stimulate macrophage polarization toward the M2 immunomodulatory functional phenotype, contributing to the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques.
Liver X receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which is mainly involved in cholesterol homeostasis, bile acid and triglycerides metabolism, and, as recently discovered, in the glucose metabolism by direct regulation of liver glucokinase. Its modulation by exogenous factors, such as drugs, industrial by-products, and chemicals is documented. Owing to the abundance of these synthetic molecules in the environment, and to the established target role of this receptor, a number of representative compounds of phthalate, organophosphate and fibrate classes were tested as ligands/modulators of human liver X receptor, using an integrated approach, combining an in silico molecular docking technique with an optical SPR biosensor binding study. The compounds of interest were predicted and proved to target the oxysterols-binding site of human LXRα with measurable binding kinetic constants and with affinities ranging between 4.3 × 10(-7) and 4.3 × 10(-8)M. Additionally, non-cytotoxic concentration of these chemicals induced relevant changes in the LXRα gene expression levels and other target genes (SREBP-1c and LGK) in human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), as demonstrated by q-RT-PCR.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of DNA-binding transcription factors and act as sensors of cholesterol homeostasis. Under normal conditions, when intracellular cholesterol concentration increases, cells synthesize oxysterols and activate the LXR transcriptional network to drive cholesterol efflux and reduce cholesterol influx and synthesis. During normal and cancer cell proliferation, there is a net uncoupling between intracellular cholesterol increase and LXR activation resulting from the reduced intracellular oxysterol concentration. This review dissects the novel mechanisms of a previously unrecognized metabolic uncoupling, supporting the activation of the LXR axis as a bona fide therapeutic approach in cancer.
