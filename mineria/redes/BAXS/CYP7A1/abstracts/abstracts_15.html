<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Strobilation is a unique asexual reproduction mode of scyphozoan jellyfish, through which benthic polyp develops into pelagic medusa. It is an orderly metamorphosis process triggered by environmental signals. However, the knowledges of molecular mechanisms under the drastic morphological and physiological changes are still limited. In this study, the transcriptomes from polyps to juvenile medusae at different stages were characterized by RNA-seq in scyphozoan jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum. Among 96,076 de novo assembled unigenes, 7090 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during the developmental stages. The co-expression pattern analysis of DEGs yielded 15 clusters with different expression patterns. Among them, a cluster with 388 unigenes was related to strobila. In this specific cluster, the GO terms related to "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" and "sequence-specific DNA binding" were significantly enriched. Transcription factors, including segmentation protein even-skipped-like, segmentation polarity protein engrailed-like, homeobox proteins Otx-like, Twist-like and Cnox2-Pc-like, as well as genes such as RxR-like and Dmrtf-like, were identified to be potentially involved in strobilation. Their expression patterns and the other 11 TFs/genes involved in strobilation were confirmed with qRT-PCR methods. The present study pointed out the role of transcription factors in strobilation and produced a list of novel candidate genes for further studies. It could provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of jellyfish strobilation.
The identity of the endogenous RXR ligand has not been conclusively determined, even though several compounds of natural origin, including retinoids and fatty acids, have been postulated to fulfill this role. Filling this gap, 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid (9CDHRA) was identified as an endogenous RXR ligand in mice. This review examines the physiological relevance of various potential endogenous RXR ligands, especially 9CDHRA. The elusive steps in the metabolic synthesis of 9CDHRA, as well as the nutritional/nutrimetabolic origin of 9CDHRA, are also explored, along with the suitability of the ligand to be the representative member of a novel vitamin A class (vitamin A5).
Classically, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals in secreted integral membrane proteins impose the requirement to assemble with other cognate subunits to form functional assemblies before they can exit the ER. We report that GluK5 has two ER retention signals in its cytoplasmic C-terminus: an arginine-based signal and a di-leucine motif previously thought to be an endocytic motif. GluK5 assembles with GluK2, but surprisingly GluK2 association does little to block the ER retention signals. We find instead that the ER retention signals are blocked by two proteins involved in intracellular trafficking, SAP97 and CASK. We show that SAP97, in the presence of CASK and the receptor complex, assumes an extended conformation. In the extended conformation, SAP97 makes its SH3 and GuK domains available to bind and sterically mask the ER retention signals in the GluK5 C-terminus. SAP97 and CASK are also necessary for sorting receptor cargoes into the local dendritic secretory pathway in neurons. We show that the ER retention signals of GluK5 play a vital role in sorting the receptor complex in the local dendritic secretory pathway in neurons. These data suggest a new role for ER retention signals in trafficking integral membrane proteins in neurons. SIGNIFICANCE: We present evidence that the ER retention signals in the kainate receptors containing GluK5 impose a requirement for sorting into local dendritic secretory pathways in neurons, as opposed to traversing the somatic Golgi apparatus. There are two ER retention signals in the C-terminus of GluK5. We show that both are blocked by physical association with SAP97 and CASK. The SH3 and GuK domains of SAP97, in the presence of CASK, bind directly to each ER retention signal and form a complex. These results support an entirely new function for ER retention signals in the C-termini of neuronal receptors, such as NMDA and kainate receptors, and define a mechanism for selective entry of receptors into local secretory pathways.
Asthma is thought to be caused by malfunction of type 2 T helper cell (Th2)-mediated immunity, causing excessive inflammation, mucus overproduction, and apoptosis of airway epithelial cells. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) functions in heme catabolism and is both cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory. We hypothesized that this dual function may be related to asthma's etiology. Using primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) and an asthma mouse model, we demonstrate that severe lung inflammation is associated with rapid pAEC apoptosis. Surprisingly, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inhibition, retinoid X receptor (RXR) deficiency, and HO-1 induction were associated with abrogated apoptosis. MCC950, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 activation, reduced RXR expression, leading to decreased pAEC apoptosis that was reversed by the RXR agonist adapalene. Of note, HO-1 induction in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced eosinophilic asthma suppressed Th2 responses and reduced apoptosis of pulmonary pAECs. In vitro, HO-1 induction desensitized cultured pAECs to ovalbumin-induced apoptosis, confirming the in vivo observations. Critically, the HO-1 products carbon monoxide and bilirubin suppressed the NLRP3-RXR axis in pAECs. Furthermore, HO-1 impaired production of NLRP3-RXR-induced cytokines (interleukin [IL]-25, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in pAECs and lungs. Finally, we demonstrate that HO-1 binds to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and the RXRα and RXRβ subunits and that this binding is not reversed by Sn-protoporphyrin. Our findings indicate that HO-1 and its products are essential for pAEC survival to maintain airway epithelium homeostasis during NLRP3-RXR-mediated apoptosis and inflammation.
Macrophages polarize into distinct phenotypes in response to complex environmental cues. We found that the nuclear receptor PPARγ drove robust phenotypic changes in macrophages upon repeated stimulation with interleukin (IL)-4. The functions of PPARγ on macrophage polarization in this setting were independent of ligand binding. Ligand-insensitive PPARγ bound DNA and recruited the coactivator P300 and the architectural protein RAD21. This established a permissive chromatin environment that conferred transcriptional memory by facilitating the binding of the transcriptional regulator STAT6 and RNA polymerase II, leading to robust production of enhancer and mRNAs upon IL-4 re-stimulation. Ligand-insensitive PPARγ binding controlled the expression of an extracellular matrix remodeling-related gene network in macrophages. Expression of these genes increased during muscle regeneration in a mouse model of injury, and this increase coincided with the detection of IL-4 and PPARγ in the affected tissue. Thus, a predominantly ligand-insensitive PPARγ:RXR cistrome regulates progressive and/or reinforcing macrophage polarization.
In the classical pathway of retinoic acid (RA) mediated gene transcription, RA binds to a nuclear hormone receptor dimer composed of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), to induce the expression of its downstream target genes. In addition to nuclear receptors, there are other intracellular RA binding proteins such as cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP1 and CRABP2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, whose contributions to the RA signaling pathway have not been fully understood. The objective of this study was to compare the significance of various RA binding receptors, i.e. CRABP1, CRABP2, CYP and RAR in the RA signaling pathway. In this regard, we developed a mathematical model of the RA pathway, which is one of the few models, if not the only one, that includes all main intracellular RA binding receptors. We then performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to investigate the contribution of the RA receptors to RA-induced mRNA production, when the cells were treated with a wide range of RA levels, from physiological to pharmacological concentrations.
Our results show that CRABP2 and RAR are the most and the least important proteins, respectively, in controlling the model performance at physiological concentrations of RA (1-10 nM). However, at higher concentrations of RA, CYP and RAR are the most sensitive parameters of the system. Furthermore, we found that depending on the concentrations of all RA binding proteins, the rate of metabolism of RA can either change or remain constant following RA therapy. The cellular levels of CRABP1 are more important than that of CRABP2 in controlling RA metabolite formation at pharmacological conditions (RA = 0.1-1 μM). Finally, our results indicate a significant negative correlation between total mRNA production and total RA metabolite formation at pharmacological levels of RA.
Our simulations indicate that the significance of the RA binding proteins in the RA pathway of gene expression strongly depends on intracellular concentration of RA. This study not only can explain why various cell types respond to RA therapy differently, but also can potentially help develop pharmacological methods to increase the efficacy of the drug.
A novel pathway of vitamin D activation by CYP11A has previously been elucidated. To define the mechanism of action of its major dihydroxy-products, we tested the divergence and overlap between the gene expression profiles of human epidermal keratinocytes treated with either CYP11A1-derived 20,23(OH)₂D3 or classical 1,25(OH)₂D3. Both secosteroids have significant chemical similarity with the only differences being the positions of the hydroxyl groups. mRNA was isolated and examined by microarray analysis using Illumina's HumanWG-6 chip/arrays and subsequent bioinformatics analyses. Marked differences in the up- and downregulated genes were observed between 1,25(OH)₂D3- and 20,23(OH)₂D3-treated cells. Hierarchical clustering identified both distinct, opposite and common (overlapping) gene expression patterns. CYP24A1 was a common gene strongly activated by both compounds, a finding confirmed by qPCR. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified VDR/RXR signaling as the top canonical pathway induced by 1,25(OH)₂D3. In contrast, the top canonical pathway induced by 20,23(OH)₂D3 was AhR, with VDR/RXR being the second nuclear receptor signaling pathway identified. QPCR analyses validated the former finding by revealing that 20,23(OH)₂D3 stimulated CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene expression, effects located downstream of AhR. Similar stimulation was observed with 20(OH)D3, the precursor to 20,23(OH)₂D3, as well as with its downstream metabolite, 17,20,23(OH)₃D3. Using a Human AhR Reporter Assay System we showed marked activation of AhR activity by 20,23(OH)₂D3, with weaker stimulation by 20(OH)D3. Finally, molecular modeling using an AhR LBD model predicted vitamin D3 hydroxyderivatives to be good ligands for this receptor. Thus, our microarray, qPCR, functional studies and molecular modeling indicate that AhR is the major receptor target for 20,23(OH)₂D3, opening an exciting area of investigation on the interaction of different vitamin D3-hydroxyderivatives with AhR and the subsequent downstream activation of signal transduction pathways in a cell-type-dependent manner.
Carotenoids and retinoids are known to alter the allergic response with important physiological roles in the skin and the immune system. In the human organism various carotenoids are present, some of which are retinoid precursors. The bioactive derivatives of these retinoids are the retinoic acids, which can potently activate nuclear hormone receptors such as the retinoic acid receptor and the retinoid X receptor. In this study, we aimed to assess how plasma carotenoid and retinoid concentrations along with the ratio of their isomers are altered in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients (n = 20) compared to healthy volunteers (HV, n = 20). The study indicated that plasma levels of the carotenoids lutein (HV 198 ± 14 ng/mL, AD 158 ± 12 ng/mL, p = 0.02; all values in mean ± SEM), zeaxanthin (HV 349 ± 30 ng/mL, AD 236 ± 18 ng/mL, p ≤ 0.01), as well as the retinoids retinol (HV 216 ± 20 ng/mL, AD 167 ± 17 ng/mL, p = 0.04) and all-trans-retinoic acid (HV 1.1 ± 0.1 ng/mL, AD 0.7 ± 0.1 ng/mL, p = 0.04) were significantly lower in the AD-patients, while lycopene isomers, α-carotene, and β-carotene levels were comparable to that determined in the healthy volunteers. In addition, the ratios of 13-cis- vs. all-trans-lycopene (HV 0.31 ± 0.01, AD 0.45 ± 0.07, p = 0.03) as well as 13-cis- vs. all-trans-retinoic acid (HV 1.4 ± 0.2, AD 2.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.03) were increased in the plasma of AD-patients indicating an AD-specific 13-cis-isomerisation. A positive correlation with SCORAD was calculated with 13-cis- vs. all-trans-lycopene ratio (r = 0.40, p = 0.01), while a negative correlation was observed with zeaxanthin plasma levels (r = -0.42, p = 0.01). Based on our results, we conclude that in the plasma of AD-patients various carotenoids and retinoids are present at lower concentrations, while the ratio of selected lycopene isomers also differed in the AD-patient group. An increase in plasma isomers of both lycopene and retinoic acid may cause an altered activation of nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways and thus may be partly responsible for the AD-phenotype.
Nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) functions as the major bile acid sensor coordinating cholesterol metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and absorption of dietary fats and vitamins. Because of its central role in metabolism, FXR represents an important drug target to manage metabolic and other diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. FXR and nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) form a heterodimer that controls the expression of numerous downstream genes. To date, the structural basis and functional consequences of the FXR/RXR heterodimer interaction have remained unclear. Herein, we present the crystal structures of the heterodimeric complex formed between the ligand-binding domains of human FXR and RXRα. We show that both FXR and RXR bind to the transcriptional coregulator steroid receptor coactivator 1 with higher affinity when they are part of the heterodimer complex than when they are in their respective monomeric states. Furthermore, structural comparisons of the FXR/RXRα heterodimers and the FXR monomers bound with different ligands indicated that both heterodimerization and ligand binding induce conformational changes in the C terminus of helix 11 in FXR that affect the stability of the coactivator binding surface and the coactivator binding in FXR. In summary, our findings shed light on the allosteric signal transduction in the FXR/RXR heterodimer, which may be utilized for future drug development targeting FXR.
The availability of a reference genome assembly for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, SNP genotyping platforms and low cost sequencing are enhancing the understanding of both life history and production-related traits in this important commercial species. We collected and analyzed transcriptomes from selected tissues of Atlantic salmon to inform future functional and comparative genomics studies. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated from pituitary gland, brain, ovary, and liver before Illumina sequencing produced a total of 640 million 150-bp paired-end reads. Following read mapping, feature counting, and normalization, cluster analysis identified genes highly expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We identified a cluster of 508 tissue specific genes for pituitary gland, 3395 for brain, 2939 for ovary, and 539 for liver. Functional profiling identified gene clusters describing the unique functions of each tissue. Moreover, highly-expressed transcription factors (TFs) present in each tissue-specific gene cluster were identified. TFs belonging to homeobox and bhlh families were identified for pituitary gland, pou and zf-c2h2 families for brain, arid, and zf-c2h2 for ovary and rxr-like family for liver. The data and analysis presented are relevant to the emerging Functional Annotation of All Salmonid Genomes (FAASG) initiative that is seeking to develop a detailed understanding of both salmonid evolution and the genomic elements that drive gene expression and regulation.
Several feeding trials with Atlantic salmon fed naturally high phytosterol concentrations due to dietary rapeseed oil inclusion have shown changes in lipid metabolism and increased hepatic lipid storage in the fish. An in vitro trial with Atlantic salmon hepatocytes was, therefore, performed to study the possible direct effects of phytosterols on lipid storage and metabolism. The isolated hepatocytes were exposed to seven different sterol treatments and gene expression, as well as lipid accumulation by Oil Red O dyeing, was assessed. Fucosterol, a sterol found in many algae species, had an effect on the size of individual lipid droplets, leading to smaller lipid droplets than in the control without added sterols. A sterol extract from soybean/rapeseed led to an increase in the percentage of hepatocytes with visible lipid droplets at 20× magnification, while hepatocytes of both the sterol extract-treated groups and fucosterol-treated groups had a larger proportion of their area covered with lipids compared to control cells. Brassicasterol, a sterol characteristic of rapeseed oil, was the only sterol treatment leading to a change in gene expression, affecting the expression of the nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pparg) and retinoid X receptor (rxr). The current study thus shows that phytosterols can have direct, although subtle, effects on both hepatic lipid storage and gene expression of Atlantic salmon in vitro.
We evaluated the potential of retinol and retinoic acid (RA) to enhance intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in a murine cultured macrophage cell line, RAW264, to investigate whether the RA signaling pathway is involved in the β-carotene-induced GSH enhancement.
We examined GSH levels in RAW264 cells cultured in media supplemented with β-carotene and various inhibitors (ER50891 for RA receptor (RAR)α, CD2665 for RARβ/γ, or HX531 for all subtypes of retinoid X receptor (RXR)), to verify each inhibitor's activity against β-carotene, as well as in media supplemented with various stimulants (AM80 for RARα, CD2314 for RARβ, CD437 for RARγ, or SR11237 for RXR), to compare their activity with that of β-carotene. We also examined the GSH level and glutamate-cysteine-ligase (GCL) expression in RAW264 cells cultured in all-trans RA- or retinol-supplemented media. Enhanced GSH production was not inhibited by any tested antagonist, and, apart from β-carotene, no agonist induced GSH production. Retinol, but not all-trans RA, enhanced GSH synthesis and increased GCL expression, similar to that observed with β-carotene.
The RA signaling pathway may not be involved in the β-carotene-induced enhancement of GSH levels in RAW264 cells, whereas, like β-carotene, retinol can enhance the GSH level and GCL expression.
Adipocyte is an important place for lipid storage. Defects in lipid storage in adipocytes can lead to lipodystrophy and lipid accumulation in muscle, liver, and other organs. It is the condition of mixed dyslipidemia which may favor the development of insulin resistance via lipotoxic mechanisms. Our objective of the study was to investigate the potential role of R-limonene (LM) on differentiation, lipid storage, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Genes and proteins associated with differentiation, lipid accumulation, 2DG uptake and its signaling pathways in the adipocytes were analyzed using qPCR and western blot methods. LM treatment increased differentiation, lipid accumulation, and the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic markers such as C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, PPARγ, SREBP-1, RXR, FAS, and adiponectin. However, the LM concentration at 10μM decreased (p &lt; 0.05) adipogenesis and lipogenesis via regulating key transcriptional factors. LM treatment increased activation of Akt by increasing its phosphorylation, but p44/42 activation was not altered. MK-2206, an Akt specific inhibitor, reduced the activation of Akt phosphorylation whereas LM treatment aborted the MK-2206 mediated inhibition of Akt activation. LM enhanced glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes. Overall data suggested that LM treatment favored lipid storage and glucose uptake in adipocytes via activation of key transcriptional factors through activation of Akt phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are tightly regulated by the corepressors nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors. Three conserved corepressor/NR signature box motifs (CoRNR1-3) forming the nuclear receptor interaction domain have been identified in these corepressors. Whereas TRs regulate multiple normal physiological and developmental pathways, mutations in TRs can result in endocrine diseases and be associated with cancers due to impairment of corepressor release. Three mutants that are located in helix H11 of TRs are of special interest: TRα-M388I, a mutant associated with the development of renal clear cell carcinomas (RCCCs), and TRβ-Δ430 and TRβ-Δ432, two deletion mutants causing resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome.
Several cell-based and biophysical methods were used to measure the affinity between wild-type and mutant TRα and TRβ and all the CoRNR motifs from corepressors to quantify the effects of different thyroid hormone analogues on these interactions. This study was coupled with the measurement of interactions between wild-type and mutant TRs in the context of a heterodimer with RXR to a NCoR fragment in the presence of the same ligands. Structural insights into the binding mode of corepressors to TRs were assessed in parallel by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
The study shows that TRs interact more avidly with the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors than with NCoR peptides, and that TRα binds most avidly to S-CoRNR3, whereas TRβ binds preferentially to S-CoRNR2. In the studied TR mutants, a transfer of the CoRNR-specificity toward CoRNR1 was observed, coupled with a significant increase in the binding strength. In contrast to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), the agonist TRIAC and the antagonist NH-3 were very efficient at dissociating the abnormally strong interactions between mutant TRβs and corepressors. A strong impairment of T3-binding for TRβ mutants was shown compared to TRIAC and NH-3 and could explain the different efficiencies of the different ligands in releasing corepressors from the studied TRβ mutants. Consequently, TRIAC was found to be more effective than T3 in facilitating coactivator recruitment and decreasing the dominant activity of TRβ-Δ430.
This study helps to clarify the specific interaction surfaces involved in the pathologic phenotype of TR mutants and demonstrates that TRIAC is a potential therapeutic agent for patients suffering from resistance to thyroid hormone syndromes.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an effective drug for the induction therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the treatment is associated with adverse events such as retinoic acid syndrome (RAS) in some patients, whose histologic characteristics included organ infiltration by leukemic cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is often upregulated in tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell migration and invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix. In this study, we examined the possible modulatory effects of ATRA on MMP-2 expression and secretion in human myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1. The cells were treated with various concentrations of ATRA, and MMP-2 expression and secretion were examined. MMP-2 expression and secretion started to increase with ATRA concentration as low as 0.1 nM and gradually increased thereafter. Agonists of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR) alone could enhance MMP-2 secretion, and RAR or RXR antagonists alone could reverse ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. ATRA increased intracellular calcium ion levels, and a calcium-channel blocker inhibited ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. Dexamethasone suppressed ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. Our results suggest that ATRA enhances MMP-2 expression and secretion in human myeloid leukemia THP-1 cells in a calcium ion dependent manner through RAR/RXR signaling pathways, and this enhanced expression and secretion may be associated with the possible mechanisms of RAS.
Vitamin D is a precursor for secosteroidal hormones, which demonstrate pleiotropic biological activities, including the regulation of growth and the differentiation of normal and malignant cells. Our previous studies have indicated that the inhibition of melanoma proliferation by a short side-chain, low calcemic analog of vitamin D-21(OH)pD is not fully dependent on the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR). We have examined the effects of classic vitamin D metabolites, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and 25(OH)D₃, and two low calcemic vitamin D analogs, (21(OH)pD and calcipotriol), on proliferation, mRNA expression and vitamin D receptor (VDR) translocation in three human melanoma cell lines: WM98, A375 and SK-MEL-188b (subline b of SK-MEL-188, which lost responsiveness to 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and became VDR-/-CYP27B1-/-). All tested compounds efficiently inhibited the proliferation of WM98 and A375 melanoma cells except SK-MEL-188b, in which only the short side-chain vitamin D analog-21(OH)pD was effective. Overall, 21(OH)pD was the most potent compound in all three melanoma cell lines in the study. The lack of responsiveness of SK-MEL-188b to 1,25(OH)₂D₃, 25(OH)D₃ and calcipotriol is explained by a lack of characteristic transcripts for the VDR, its splicing variants as well as for vitamin D-activating enzyme CYP27B1. On the other hand, the expression of VDR and its splicing variants and other vitamin D related genes (RXR, PDIA3, CYP3A4, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1 and CYP11A1) was detected in WM98 and A375 melanomas with the transcript levels being modulated by vitamin D analogs. The expression of VDR isoforms in WM98 cells was stimulated strongly by calcipotriol. The antiproliferative activities of 21(OH)pD appear not to require VDR translocation to the nucleus, which explains the high efficacy of this noncalcemic pregnacalciferol analog in SK-MEL-188b melanoma, that is, VDR-/-. Therefore, we propose that 21(OH)pD is a good candidate for melanoma therapy, although the mechanism of its action remains to be defined.
The vitamin A derivative 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) has been used for the treatment and prevention of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, the precise mechanism by which 9-cis-RA treatment ameliorates CTCL remains elusive. Our research shows that 9-cis-RA inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in CTCL cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. 9-Cis-RA also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by downregulation of cyclin D1. We confirmed that 9-cis-RA significantly decreased phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT3, and STAT5 and downregulated Bcl-xL and cyclin D1, indicating that 9-cis-RA inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT signaling. Meanwhile, 9-cis-RA also activated classical RA-mediated transcription by retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and/or retinoid X receptors (RXR) in a CTCL cell line. Thus, 9-cis-RA may be effective for chemotherapy and may prevent human CTCL by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis by inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway and activation of the RAR/RXR pathway.
The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) contains scales that were designed to make predictions about how an individual might respond to treatment, thereby allowing clinicians to attune treatment plans to a client's specific needs. The present study utilized two features of the PAI as predictors of treatment process and outcome in a sample of 47 outpatient veterans: the Treatment Rejection (RXR) scale and the Treatment Process Index (TPI). Data were collected for three treatment process and outcome measures: treatment utilization (ratio of appointments attended to appointments scheduled), therapist-rated therapeutic alliance, and symptom change over time. Results indicated that RXR significantly predicted utilization over and above the TPI. The TPI significantly predicted the rate of distress symptom decline over time, but RXR did not. Lastly, neither RXR nor the TPI were significant predictors of therapist-rated alliance.
The objective of this study was to provide evidence of the validity of utilizing pigs as a model to study the regulation of human CYP3A4, with special emphasis on drug-drug interactions. We determined the mRNA expression and distribution of CYP3A and metabolic nuclear receptors in different tissues isolated from landrace pigs. Our results showed that CYP3A and metabolic nuclear receptor mRNAs were most highly expressed in liver tissues. The expression of the metabolic nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) had a significant correlation with expression of CYP3A29, an analog of human CYP3A4. The correlation between their transcriptional levels was further demonstrated using LPS and TNF-α. The mRNA and protein expression of CYP3A29 and PXR in HepLi cells was significantly reduced by LPS and TNF-α treatment. CYP3A29 promoter activity was dramatically elevated by PXR over expression, whereas LPS and TNF-α treatment inhibited the enhanced CYP3A29 promoter activity that was induced by PXR; presumably through inhibition of PXR promoter activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of CYP3A29 promoter activity by LPS and TNF-α treatment was blocked by knockdown of PXR or retinoid X receptor (RXR). These data suggest high similarity in the regulation mechanism of pig CYP3A29 and human CYP3A4. Our research provided a significant evaluation to determine whether pigs are suitable as an experimental animal model.
The lack of potent subtype-selective modulators of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) has hindered their full exploitation as promising drug targets. Using computational similarity searching, target prediction and automated de novo design, we identified novel RXR ligands exhibiting innovative molecular frameworks, pronounced receptor-subtype preference and suitable properties for hit-to-lead expansion.
Considerable variation in feed efficiency (FE) has been observed in indigenous and selected meat-type chicken populations. Although this variation could be partially linked to extrinsic factors like diet, housing environment and microbiota, it further illustrates the existence of strong molecular mechanisms enabling the differential allocation of resources for various physiological processes. To further deepen the molecular basis of individual allocation capacity in male and female broilers, an RNA-seq experiment was conducted which based on a phenotyped chicken population divergent in FE. Transcriptional differences linked to FE were pronounced in intestinal and muscular tissue sites of male animals. Specifically, signalling pathways of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) might contribute to mediate individual FE. The transcriptional profiles suggested ACSBG2 (muscular lipid utilisation), ASBT (intestinal bile salt transport), CLEC2B (natural killer cell activation), HMGCS2 (jejunal, duodenal and muscular ketogenesis), and SCARB1 (jejunal lipid uptake) as potential mediators driving FE. Results indicate that improvements in FE exploit shifts in resource allocation which might occur at the expense of general immune responsiveness in high efficient male chickens. Consequently, to further improve FE traits and to explore causative molecular patterns, effects originating from sex-dimorphism in chickens need to be taken into consideration.
Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent the largest subfamily of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and play important roles in regulating growth, development, and stress responses in plants. In this study, 246 LRR-RLK genes were identified in the potato (Solanum tuberosum) genome, which were further classified into 14 subfamilies. Gene structure analysis revealed that genes within the same subgroup shared similar exon/intron structures. A signature small peptide recognition motif (RxR) was found to be largely conserved within members of subfamily IX, suggesting that these members may recognize peptide signals as ligands. 26 of the 246 StLRR-RLK genes were found to have arisen from tandem or segmental duplication events. Expression profiling revealed that StLRR-RLK genes were differentially expressed in various organs/tissues, and several genes were found to be responsive to different stress treatments. Furthermore, StLRR-RLK117 was found to be able to form homodimers and heterodimers with StLRR-RLK042 and StLRR-RLK052. Notably, the overlapping expression region of StLRR-RLK117 with Solanum tuberosum WUSCHEL (StWUS) suggested that the CLV3⁻CLV1/BAM⁻WUS feedback loop may be conserved in potato to maintain stem cell homeostasis within the shoot apical meristem.
Recent discovery of potent antibacterial antisense PNA-peptide conjugates encouraged development of a fast and efficient synthesis protocol that facilitates structure-activity studies. The use of an Fmoc/Boc protection scheme for both PNA monomers and amino acid building blocks in combination with microwave-assisted solid-phase synthesis proved to be a convenient procedure for continuous assembly of antisense PNA-peptide conjugates. A validated antisense PNA oligomer (CTCATACTCT; targeting mRNA of the acpP gene) was linked to N-terminally modified drosocin (i.e., RXR-PRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV; X = aminohexanoic acid) or to a truncated Pip1 peptide (i.e., RXRRXR-IKILFQNRRMKWKK; X = aminohexanoic acid), and determination of the antibacterial effects of the resulting conjugates allowed assessment of the influence of different linkers as well as differences between the L- and D-forms of the peptides. The drosocin-derived compound without a linker moiety exhibited highest antibacterial activity against both wild-type Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MICs in the range 2-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.3-0.7 μM), while analogues displaying an ethylene glycol (eg1) moiety or a polar maleimide linker also possessed activity toward wild-type K. pneumoniae (MICs of 4-8 μg/mL ∼ 0.6-1.3 μM). Against two colistin-resistant E. coli strains the linker-deficient compound proved most potent (with MICs in the range 2-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.3-0.7 μM). The truncated all-L Pip1 peptide had moderate inherent activity against E. coli, and this was unaltered or reduced upon conjugation to the antisense PNA oligomer. By contrast, this peptide was 8-fold less potent against K. pneumoniae, but in this case some PNA-peptide conjugates exhibited potent antisense activity (MICs of 2-8 μg/mL ∼ 0.3-1.2 μM). Most interestingly, the antibacterial activity of the D-form peptide itself was 2- to 16-fold higher than that of the L-form, even for the colistin- and tigecycline-resistant E. coli strains (MIC of 1-2 μg/mL ∼ 0.25-0.5 μM). Low activity was found for conjugates with a two-mismatch PNA sequence corroborating an antisense mode of action. Conjugates containing a D-form peptide were also significantly less active. In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized antisense PNA-drosocin conjugates with potent antibacterial activity against colistin- and tigecycline-resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia without concomitant hemolytic properties. In addition, a truncated D-form of Pip1 was identified as a peptide exhibiting potent activity against both wild-type and multidrug-resistant E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii (MICs within the range 1-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.25-1 μM) as well as toward wild-type Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of 2-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.5-1.0 μM).
Trialkyltins and triaryltins function as nuclear retinoid X receptors (RXR) agonists due to their affinity to the ligand-binding domain of RXR subtypes and function as transcriptional activators. We present the data on combined effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) ligand and tributyltin chloride or triphenyltin chloride (RXR ligands) on protein pattern in MDA-MB-231 cells. Proteomic strategies based on bottom-up method were applied in this study. The total cell proteins were extracted, separated on 2D SDS-PAGE and their characterization was achieved by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. By employing PDQuest™ software, we identified more than 30 proteins differently affected by the above compounds. For further studies, we selected specific proteins associated either with metabolic pathway (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) or to cellular processes as apoptosis, regulation of gene transcription or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (annexin 5, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B and vimentin). We have found that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with triorganotins reduced the expression of studied proteins. Moreover, the treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with triorganotin compounds together with ATRA resulted in an additional reduction of annexin 5, vimentin and nucleoside diphosphate kinase B. These results demonstrate that RXR/RAR heterodimer may act under this experimental design as permissive heterodimer allowing activation of RXR by triorganotins.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening subtype of stroke with high mortality and disabilities. Retinoid X receptor (RXR) has been shown to be neuroprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the selective RXR agonist bexarotene on neuroinflammation in a rat model of SAH.
Two hundred male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The endovascular perforation induced SAH. Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally at 1 h after SAH induction. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the selective RXR antagonist UVI3003 and RXR siRNA or SIRT6 inhibitor OSS128167 was administered via intracerebroventricular 1 h before SAH induction. Post-SAH assessments including SAH grade, neurological score, brain water content, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed.
The endogenous RXR and sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) protein levels were increased after SAH. Bexarotene treatment significantly reduced brain edema and improved the short-/long-term neurological deficit after SAH. Mechanistically, bexarotene increased the levels of PPARγ and SIRT6; decreased the expression of phosphorylated FoxO3a (p-FoxO3a), IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a; and inhibited the microglia activation and neutrophils infiltration at 24 h after SAH. Either UVI3003, OSS128167, or RXR siRNA abolished the neuroprotective effects of bexarotene and its regulation on protein levels of PPARγ/SIRT6/p-FoxO3a after SAH.
The activation of RXR by bexarotene attenuated neuroinflammation and improved neurological deficits after SAH. The anti-neuroinflammatory effect was at least partially through regulating PPARγ/SIRT6/FoxO3a pathway. Bexarotene may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of SAH patients.
As universal heterodimer partners of many nuclear receptors, the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) constitute key transcription factors. They regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and metabolic homeostasis and have recently been proposed as potential drug targets for neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of RXR ligand binding sites, available synthetic RXR ligands are lipophilic, and their structural diversity is limited. Here, we disclose the computer-assisted discovery of a novel RXR agonist chemotype and its systematic optimization toward potent RXR modulators. We have developed a nanomolar RXR agonist with high selectivity among nuclear receptors and superior physicochemical properties compared to classical rexinoids that appears suitable for in vivo applications and as lead for future RXR-targeting medicinal chemistry.
Rexinoids, selective ligands for retinoid X receptors (RXR), have shown promise in preventing many types of cancer. However, the limited efficacy and undesirable lipidemic side-effects of the only clinically approved rexinoid, bexarotene, drive the search for new and better rexinoids. Here we report the evaluation of novel pyrimidinyl (Py) analogues of two known chemopreventive rexinoids, bexarotene (Bex) and LG100268 (LG268) in a new paradigm. We show that these novel derivatives were more effective agents than bexarotene for preventing lung carcinogenesis induced by a carcinogen. In addition, these new analogues have an improved safety profile. PyBex caused less elevation of plasma triglyceride levels than bexarotene, while PyLG268 reduced plasma cholesterol levels and hepatomegaly compared with LG100268. Notably, this new paradigm mechanistically emphasizes the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of rexinoids. We reveal new immunomodulatory actions of the above rexinoids, especially their ability to diminish the percentage of macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the lung and to redirect activation of M2 macrophages. The rexinoids also potently inhibit critical inflammatory mediators including IL6, IL1β, CCL9, and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, in vitro iNOS and SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) induction assays correlate with in vivo efficacy and toxicity, respectively. Our results not only report novel pyrimidine derivatives of existing rexinoids, but also describe a series of biological screening assays that will guide the synthesis of additional rexinoids. Further progress in rexinoid synthesis, potency, and safety should eventually lead to a clinically acceptable and useful new drug for patients with cancer.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, and upon ligand activation, these receptors control gene transcription via either homodimerization with themselves or heterodimerization with the partner-nuclear receptor. The protective effects of RXRs and RXR agonists have been reported in several neurodegenerative diseases, including in the retina. This study was aimed to prioritize compounds from natural and synthetic origin retinoids as potential RXR agonists by molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation strategies. The docking studies indicated bexarotene as a lead compound that can activate various RXR receptor isoforms (α, β, and γ) and has a strong binding affinity to the receptor protein than retinoic acid, which is known as a natural endogenous RXR agonist. Dynamic simulation studies confirmed that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were highly stable in all the three isoforms of the RXR-bexarotene complex. To further validate the significance of the RXR receptor in neurons, in vitro pharmacological treatment of neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with bexarotene was performed. In vitro data from SH-SY5Y cells confirmed that bexarotene activated RXR-simulated neurite outgrowth significantly. We conclude that bexarotene could be potentially used as an exogenous activator of RXRs and emerge as a good drug target for several neurodegenerative disorders.
Gene expression profiling is a useful tool to predict and interrogate mechanisms of toxicity. RNA-Seq technology has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional microarray platforms for conducting transcriptional profiling. The objective of this work was to compare both transcriptomic platforms to determine whether RNA-Seq offered significant advantages over microarrays for toxicogenomic studies. RNA samples from the livers of rats treated for 5 days with five tool hepatotoxicants (α-naphthylisothiocyanate/ANIT, carbon tetrachloride/CCl4, methylenedianiline/MDA, acetaminophen/APAP, and diclofenac/DCLF) were analyzed with both gene expression platforms (RNA-Seq and microarray). Data were compared to determine any potential added scientific (i.e., better biological or toxicological insight) value offered by RNA-Seq compared to microarrays. RNA-Seq identified more differentially expressed protein-coding genes and provided a wider quantitative range of expression level changes when compared to microarrays. Both platforms identified a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in livers of rats treated with ANIT, MDA, and CCl4 compared to APAP and DCLF, in agreement with the severity of histopathological findings. Approximately 78% of DEGs identified with microarrays overlapped with RNA-Seq data, with a Spearman's correlation of 0.7 to 0.83. Consistent with the mechanisms of toxicity of ANIT, APAP, MDA and CCl4, both platforms identified dysregulation of liver relevant pathways such as Nrf2, cholesterol biosynthesis, eiF2, hepatic cholestasis, glutathione and LPS/IL-1 mediated RXR inhibition. RNA-Seq data showed additional DEGs that not only significantly enriched these pathways, but also suggested modulation of additional liver relevant pathways. In addition, RNA-Seq enabled the identification of non-coding DEGs that offer a potential for improved mechanistic clarity. Overall, these results indicate that RNA-Seq is an acceptable alternative platform to microarrays for rat toxicogenomic studies with several advantages. Because of its wider dynamic range as well as its ability to identify a larger number of DEGs, RNA-Seq may generate more insight into mechanisms of toxicity. However, more extensive reference data will be necessary to fully leverage these additional RNA-Seq data, especially for non-coding sequences.
The retinoic X receptor (RXR) plays a crucial role in the superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs) by acting as an obligatory partner of several nuclear receptors; its role as a transcription factor is thus critical in many signalling pathways, such as metabolism, cell development, differentiation and cellular death. The first published structure of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RXRα, which is still used as a reference today, contained inaccuracies. In the present work, these inaccuracies were corrected using modern crystallographic tools. The most important correction concerns the presence of a π-bulge in helix H7, which was originally built as a regular α-helix. The presence of several CHAPS molecules, which are visible for the first time in the electron-density map and which stabilize the H1-H3 loop, which contains helix H2, are also revealed. The apo RXR structure has played an essential role in deciphering the molecular mode of action of NR ligands and is still used in numerous biophysical studies. This refined structure should be used preferentially in the future in interpreting experiments as well as for modelling and structural dynamics studies of the apo RXRα LBD.
The possibility that a wide variety of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their derivatives are present in the environment necessitates detailed evaluation of their toxicities. A number of PCBs and monohydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) have been reported to have affinities for several nuclear receptors, and some of these compounds have been shown to have harmful effects in animals. In this study, we focused on the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), which play critical roles in development and homeostasis. Specifically, we measured the agonistic activities of 91 OH-PCBs on these receptors by using yeast cells transfected with human RXRβ or RARγ. Of the tested OH-PCBs, 20 exhibited agonistic activity on RXRβ and 35 on RARγ, although their activities were lower than those of the respective endogenous ligands. Most of the OH-PCBs that showed potent activity on RXRβ were tri- or tetrachlorinated compounds, whereas most of the active compounds on RARγ were di-, tri-, or tetrachlorinated compounds. The optimal position for the hydroxyl group relative to the bond linking the aromatic rings was ortho for RXRβ and meta for RARγ. The activities of the OH-PCBs on RXRβ depended strongly on the position of the hydroxyl group, whereas those on RARγ did not. Taken together with the results of our previous studies of compounds with effects on other nuclear receptors, these results provide critical information for further research on receptor-mediated toxicity, endocrine-disrupting effects, and structure-activity relationships.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) play an important role in transcription, are involved in numerous cellular networks from cell proliferation to lipid metabolism and are essential for normal eye development. RXRs form homo or heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, bind to DNA response elements and regulate several biological processes including neurogenesis. Mounting evidence suggests that RXR activation by selective RXR modulators (sRXRms) may be neuroprotective in the central nervous system. However, their potential neuroprotective role in the retina and specifically in glaucoma remains unexplored. This study investigated changes in RXR expression in the human and mouse retina under glaucomatous stress conditions and investigated the effect of RXR modulation on the RGCs using pharmacological approaches. RXR protein levels in retina were downregulated in both human glaucoma and experimental RGC injury models while RXR agonist, bexarotene treatment resulted in upregulation of RXR expression particularly in the inner retinal layers. Retinal electrophysiological recordings and histological analysis indicated that inner retinal function and retinal laminar structure were preserved upon treatment with bexarotene. These protective effects were associated with downregulation of ER stress marker response upon bexarotene treatment under glaucoma conditions. Overall, retinal RXR modulation by bexarotene significantly protected RGCs in vivo in both acute and chronic glaucoma models.
The fatty acid sensing nuclear receptor families retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) hold therapeutic potential in neurodegeneration. Valuable pleiotropic activities of Wy14,643 in models of such conditions exceed its known PPAR agonistic profile. Here, we characterize the compound as an RXR agonist explaining the pleiotropic effects and report its systematic structure-activity relationship analysis with the discovery of specific molecular determinants driving activity on PPARs and RXRs. We have designed close analogues of the drug comprising selective and dual agonism on RXRs and PPARs that may serve as superior pharmacological tools to study the role and interplay of the nuclear receptors in various pathologies. A systematically optimized high potency RXR agonist revealed activity in vivo and active concentrations in brain. With its lack of RXR/liver X receptor-mediated side effects and superior profile compared to classical rexinoids, it establishes a new class of innovative RXR modulators to overcome key challenges in RXR targeting drug discovery.
Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women worldwide. It is a multi-factorial disease caused by
genetic and environmental factors. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to lower the risk of breast cancer via the nuclear
vitamin D receptor (VDR). Genetic variants of these vitamin D metabolizing genes may alter the bioavailability of
vitamin D, and hence modulate the risk of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The distribution of Fok1 VDR gene
(rs2228570) polymorphism and its association with breast cancer was analysed in a case–control study based on 125
breast cancer patients and 125 healthy females from North Indian population, using PCR-RFLP. An In silico exploration
of the probable mechanism of increased risk of breast cancer was performed to investigate the role of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer susceptibility. Results: The Fok1 ff genotype was significantly associated with an
increased risk of breast cancer (p=0.001; χ2=13.09; OR=16.909; %95 CI=2.20 - 130.11). In silico analysis indicated
that SNPs may lead to a loss in affinity of VDR to calcitriol, and may also cause the impairment of normal interaction
of liganded VDR with its heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), at protein level, thereby affecting target
gene transcription. Conclusion: Breast cancer risk and pathogenesis in females can be influenced by SNPs. SNPs in
VDR may cause alterations in the major molecular actions of VDR, namely ligand binding, heterodimerization and
transactivation. VDRE binding and co-activator recruitment by VDR appear to be functionally inseparable events that
affect vitamin D-elicited gene transcription. This indicates that breast cancer risk and pathogenesis in females may be
influenced by SNPs.
Carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the most frequently detected pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic environments, has recently been shown to cause chronic toxicity and endocrine disruption in a variety of non-target aquatic organisms. However, neither the effects nor the specific mechanism of CBZ action on the molting of crustaceans is well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CBZ on the molting and growth of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, a native and economically important species in China, and to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which molt inhibition occurs. Juvenile E. sinensis were treated with four nominal environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 μg/L) of CBZ for acute (4 days) and chronic (40 days) exposures. After acute exposure, chitinase activity in the epidermis and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) concentration in the hemolymph were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) following treatment with 10 μg/L CBZ, whereas epidermal chitobiase activity significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in response to both 1 and 10 μg/L CBZ treatments. Transcript levels of the genes encoding crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (chh) and molt-inhibiting hormone (mih) in the eyestalks were also markedly induced after 1 or 10 μg/L CBZ treatment (p &lt;  0.05), whereas the expression of genes encoding ecdysone receptor (ecr) and crustacean retinoid X receptor (rxr) in the hepatopancreas were significantly suppressed (p &lt; 0.05) after acute exposure. Moreover, under chronic exposure, CBZ inhibited the molting and growth of E. sinensis, resulting in a longer time before molting was completed (TBM), as well as a lower molting increment (MI) with 1 or 10 μg/L treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Collectively, these data indicate that CBZ can inhibit the molting process of E. sinensis by interfering with the activity of chitinolytic enzymes and molting hormone signaling, suggestive that carbamazepine may have long-term effects on crab development. We also confirmed that CBZ may function as an endocrine disruptor in decapod crustaceans, a phenomenon that has previously been reported in vertebrates.
Vitamin D3 and its receptor are responsible for controlling energy expenditure in adipocytes and have direct roles in the transcriptional regulation of energy metabolic pathways. This phenomenon also has a significant impact on the etiology of prostate cancer (PCa). Using several in vitro models, the roles of vitamin D3 on energy metabolism and its implication in primary, early, and late invasive PCa were investigated. BODIPY staining and qPCR analyses show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) up-regulates de novo lipogenesis in PCa cells by orchestrating transcriptional regulation that affects cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways. This lipogenic effect is highly dependent on the interaction of several nuclear receptors and their corresponding ligands, including androgen receptor (AR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In contrast, inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling blocks the induction of the lipogenic phenotype induced by these receptors. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9 cis-retinoic acid (9-cis RA) together redirect cytosolic citrate metabolism toward fatty acid synthesis by restoring normal prostatic zinc homeostasis that functions to truncate TCA cycle metabolism. 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9-cis RA also exert additional control of TCA cycle metabolism by down-regulating SLC25A19, which limits the availability of the co-factor thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) that is required for enzymatic catalyzation of citrate oxidation. This extensive metabolic reprogramming mediated by 1,25(OH)2D3, T, and 9-cis RA is preserved in all in vitro cell lines investigated. These data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 and T are important regulators of normal prostatic energy metabolism. Based on the close association between energy metabolism and cancer progression, supplementation of vitamin D3 and testosterone can restrict the energy production that is required to drive PCa progression by maintaining proper zinc homeostasis and inhibiting TCA cycle activity in PCa cells.
It is widely accepted that neuroinflammation in the spinal cord contribute to the development of central sensitization in neuropathic pain. MAPKs activation plays an vital role in the development of neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. In this study, we investigated the effect of bexarotene, a RXR agonist, on MAPKs activation in CCI-induced neuropathic pain. The data showed that daily treatment with bexarotene 50mg/kg significantly alleviated CCI-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity in rats. Bexarotene 50mg/kg/day inhibited CCI-induced MAPKs (p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK) activation and upregulation of proinflammatory factors(IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6). Bexarotene also reversed CCI-induced microglia activation in the ipsilateral spinal cord. Furthermore, bexarotene treatment significantly upregulated MKP-1 in the spinal cord. These effects were completely abrogated by MKP-1 inhibitor BCI. These results indicated that bexarotene relieved CCI-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain by targeting MKP-1. Therefore, bexarotene might be a potential agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
Retinoid acid receptor (RAR)-dependent signalling pathways are essential for the regulation and maintenance of essential biological functions and are recognized targets of disruptive anthropogenic compounds. Recent studies put forward the inability of mollusc RARs to bind and respond to the canonical vertebrate ligand, retinoic acid: a feature that seems to have been lost during evolution. Yet, these studies were carried out in a limited number of molluscs. Therefore, using an in vitro transactivation assay, the present work aimed to characterize phylogenetically relevant mollusc RARs, as monomers or as functional units with RXR, not only in the presence of vertebrate bone fine ligands but also known endocrine disruptors, described to modulate retinoid-dependent pathways. In general, none of the tested mollusc RARs were able to activate reporter gene transcription when exposed to retinoic acid isomers, suggesting that the ability to respond to retinoic acid was lost across molluscs. Similarly, the analysed mollusc RAR were unresponsive towards organochloride pesticides. In contrast, transcriptional repressions were observed with the RAR/RXR unit upon exposure to retinoids or RXR-specific ligands. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations further corroborate the obtained results and suggest that the repressive behaviour, observed with mollusc and human RAR/RXR heterodimers, is possibly mediated by ligand biding to RXR.
Ecdysteroid hormones influence the development and reproduction of arthropods by binding a heterodimeric complex of nuclear receptors, the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and the retinoid-X-receptor/ultraspiracle (RXR/USP). Here, we report on the in vivo role(s) of the ecdysone receptor complex, SchgrEcR/SchgrRXR, in the female reproductive physiology of a major phytophagous pest insect, i.e. the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Tissue and temporal distribution profiles were analysed during the first gonadotrophic cycle of adult female locusts. RNA interference was used as a reverse genetics tool to investigate the in vivo role of the ecdysone receptor complex in ovarian maturation, oogenesis, fertility and fecundity. We discovered that silencing the ecdysone receptor complex in S. gregaria resulted in impaired ovulation and oviposition, indicative for a crucial role of this complex in chorion formation. We also found evidence for a feedback of SchgrEcR/SchgrRXR on juvenile hormone biosynthesis by the corpora allata. Furthermore, we observed a tissue-dependent effect of the SchgrEcR/SchgrRXR knockdown on the transcript levels of the insulin receptor and neuroparsin 3 and 4. The insulin receptor transcript levels were upregulated in the brain, but not the fat body and gonads. Neuroparsins 3 and 4 transcript levels were down regulated in the brain and fat body, but not in the gonads.
To gain a greater understanding of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) we investigated the actions of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA; a retinoid), bexarotene (a pan-RXR agonist), and forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors in human OSCC-derived cell lines. RA and bexarotene have been shown to limit several oncogenic pathways in many cell types. FOXO proteins typically are associated with tumor suppressive activities, whereas FOXM1 acts as an oncogene when overexpressed in several cancers. RA and/or bexarotene increased the transcript levels of FOXO1, FOXO3A, and TRAIL receptors; reduced the transcript levels of FOXM1, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA); and decreased the proliferation of OSCC-derived cell lines. Also, RA and/or bexarotene influenced the recruitment of FOXO3A and FOXM1 to target genes. Additionally, FOXM1 depletion reduced cell proliferation, decreased transcript levels of downstream targets of FOXM1, and increased transcript levels of TRAIL receptors. Overexpression of FOXO3A decreased proliferation and increased binding of histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2 at the FOXM1, AURKB, and VEGFA promoters. This research suggests novel influences of the drugs RA and bexarotene on the expression of FOXM1 and FOXO3A in transcriptional regulatory pathways of human OSCC.
Retinoic acid (RA) regulates numerous aspects of central nervous system function through modulation of gene transcription via retinoic acid receptors (RARs). However, RA has important roles independent of gene transcription (non-genomic actions) and in the brain a crucial regulator of homeostatic plasticity is RAR control of glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) translation. An assay to quantify RAR regulation of GluR1 translation would be beneficial both to study the molecular components regulating this system and screen drugs that influence this critical mechanism for learning and memory in the brain. A bioluminescence reporter assay was developed that expresses firefly luciferase under the control of the GluR1 5' untranslated region bound by RAR. This assay was introduced into SH-SY5Y cells and used to demonstrate the role of RARα in RA regulation of GluR1 translation. A screen of synthetic RAR and RXR ligands indicated that only a subset of these ligands activated GluR1 translation. The results demonstrate the practicality of this assay to explore the contribution of RARα to this pathway and that the capacity of RAR ligands to activate translation is a quality restricted to a limited number of compounds, with implications for their RAR selectivity and potentially their specificity in drug use.
In the original publication of the article, Table 1 and Fig. 1 were incorrectly published.
The major challenge in treating cancers with ATRA is the limited availability inside the cell and resistance developed in prolonged treatment. We made an attempt for co-treatment of human NSCLC cell lines (A549) with ATRA and its isomeric precursor (9cisRA). In this study, the growth inhibitory effect of ATRA, 9cisRA and combination of both were tested in A549 cells by MTT and Trypan blue assays. As the effects of retinoid are mediated through their receptors, their gene expression levels were analyzed by RT-PCR. The target gene receptor, RAR-β protein expression, was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The cancer cell (A549) growth inhibitory effect was significantly (p ≤ 0.001) enhanced in combination treatment when compared with the result of individual treatments. The mRNA expression levels of both RAR-β and RXR-β were found to be increased in co-treatment (band density of 0.75 and 0.806, respectively) when compared with 9cisRA treatment (0.25 and 0.112) and ATRA treatment (0.01 and 0.081). A concomitant enhancement in the target RAR-β protein expression was observed in co-treated cells when compared with individual treatments. We thus conclude that the co-treatment had increased the availability of ATRA, by isomerization of the 9cisRA which then resulted in an increased expression of both RAR-β and RXR-β receptors and the target protein RAR-β which in turn inhibited lung cancer cell growth. Our study results have explored the mechanism of synergistic effect of co-treatment with ATRA and 9cisRA and further preclinical studies are necessary to validate the application of co-treatment of retinoid in clinical use.
An attractive approach to combat disease is to target theregulation of cell function. At the heart of this task are nuclear receptors (NRs); which control functions such as gene transcription. Arguably, the key player in this regulatory machinery is the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This NR associates with a third of the NRs found in humans. Scientists have hypothesized that controlling the activity of RXR is an attractive approach to control cellular functions that modulate diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will describe the key features of the RXR, present a historic perspective of the first RXR agonists, and discuss various templates that have been reported to activate RXR with a focus on their molecular structure, biological activity, and limitations. Finally, we will present an outlook of the field and future directions and considerations to synthesize or modulate RXR agonists to make these compounds a clinical reality.
Strobilation is a key stage for polyp-to-jellyfish transition. Knowledge about the strobilation-induced factors and the underlying molecular regulation mechanism could help control jellyfish bloom in nature, improve jellyfish artificial breeding, as well as get insight about the ancestral molecular origin of metamorphosis of amphibians, insect and cnidarians. Natural factors, including temperature, illumination, salinity, and symbiotic zooxanthellae, could induce strobilation. The mode of strobilation and how these natural factors irritate strobilation are distinct in different jellyfish species. Chemicals including indole derivates, 9-cis retinoic acid, elemental iodine, hydrogen peroxide, could also induce strobilation in laboratory. Indole derivates are effective inducers to most scyphozoan species. The molecular mechanism of strobilation is unclear. Results from moon jelly reveal that RxR signaling pathway plays an important role during strobilation. A secreted moon jelly-special protein named CL390 may serve as a strobilation-induced hormone precursor. These results imply that morphological differences in medusa production may mask similarities at the cellular level in different jellyfish species. The molecular mechanism of metamorphosis in jellyfish may share some consistency with amphibians and insects.
横裂是水螅体世代向水母体世代转变的重要阶段.对水螅体横裂诱发条件及调控分子机制的研究不仅对水母爆发生态学和水母人工繁育具有重要意义,而且对比较研究两栖类、昆虫以及刺胞动物等具有复杂生活史生物的变态分子机制起源也具有很好的理论价值.现有研究表明,诱发水螅体横裂的自然环境因素有温度、光照、盐度和共生虫黄藻等,不同门类水母的横裂方式以及环境诱导因素各不相同.能够诱导水螅体横裂的化学因素有吲哚类化合物、9-顺式维甲酸、碘元素和过氧化氢等,其中吲哚类化合物对绝大多数水母水螅体都有诱导作用.尽管水螅体横裂的分子机制尚未明晰,但对海月水母的研究表明,RxR信号通路以及一种横裂诱导激素前体假定蛋白CL390在水母横裂过程中起着重要的作用,提示水母变态分子机制与两栖类和昆虫在分子水平上存在一定程度的共性.
Central hypothyroidism (CH) is a well-known adverse effect of bexarotene treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). While concomitant levothyroxine therapy is recommended in these cases, associations between ethnic variation or susceptibility and bexarotene-induced CH have not yet been reported. This study aimed to characterize the kinetics and dose dependency of bexarotene-induced CH in Japanese patients.
Sixty-six Japanese patients with CTCL were retrospectively investigated by evaluating thyroid function during the early phase of bexarotene therapy.
At one week after bexarotene initiation, TSH and FT4 values significantly declined. However, this effect was not bexarotene dose-dependent at least at the dose of 96-320 mg/m2 . Approximately 1 month later, 61 patients exhibited hypothyroidism at a relatively low dose of bexarotene (average 251 mg/m2 /day). Forty-five study cases showed this effect at 1 week. Simple regression analyses indicated that higher pretreatment TSH values (at a cut-off value of 1.30:73% sensitivity, 57% specificity) or lower normal (within the lower half of the reference range) pretreatment FT4 values (84% sensitivity, 57% specificity) were predictive of hypothyroidism at 1 week. The remaining 21 cases showed euthyroidism at 1 week, at which TSH values may roughly predict their thyroid function at 1 month (at a cut-off value of 0.05:100% sensitivity, 80% specificity).
Preventive treatment with levothyroxine is recommended for Japanese CTCL patients prior to bexarotene therapy. Minimally, it should be considered for patients with a pretreatment TSH above 1.30, a lower normal pretreatment FT4, or a TSH below 0.05 at 1 week.
Vitamin D (VD) deficiency has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases (AIDs). However, the effect of the genetics of VD on the risk of MS is subject to debate. This study focuses on genes linked to the VD signaling pathway in families with MS. The evaluation of gene variants in all the members of families could contribute to an additional knowledge on the information obtained from case-control studies that use nonrelated healthy people.
We studied 94 individuals from 15 families including at least two patients with MS. We performed whole-exome next generation sequencing on all individuals and analyzed variants of the DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP3A4, CYP27A1, GC, CYP27B1, LRP2, CUBN, DAB2, FCGR, RXR, VDR, CYP24A1, and PDIA3 genes. We also studied PTH, FGF23, METTL1, METTL21B, and the role of the linkage disequilibrium block on the long arm of chromosome 12, through analysis of the CDK4, TSFM, AGAP2, and AVIL genes. We compared patients with MS, other AIDs and unaffected members from different family types.
The study described the variants in the VD signaling pathway that appear in families with at least two patients with MS. Some infrequent variants were detected in these families, but no significant difference was observed between patients with MS and/or other AIDs and unaffected family members in the frequency of these variants. Variants previously associated with MS in the literature were not observed in these families or were distributed similarly in patients and unaffected family members.
The study of genes involved in the VD signaling pathway in families that include more than one patient with MS did not identify any variants that could explain the presence of the disease, suggesting that VD metabolism could probably play a role in MS more as an environmental factor rather than as a genetic factor. Our study also supports the analysis of cases and unaffected individuals within families in order to determine the influence of genetic factors.
Mechanisms driving cognitive improvements following nuclear receptor activation are poorly understood. The peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor alpha (PPARα) forms heterodimers with the nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR). We report that PPARα mediates the improvement of hippocampal synaptic plasticity upon RXR activation in a transgenic mouse model with cognitive deficits. This improvement results from an increase in GluA1 subunit expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, eliciting an AMPA response at the excitatory synapses. Associated with a two times higher PPARα expression in males than in females, we show that male, but not female, PPARα null mutants display impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. Moreover, PPARα knockdown in the hippocampus of cognition-impaired mice compromises the beneficial effects of RXR activation on synaptic plasticity only in males. Furthermore, selective PPARα activation with pemafibrate improves synaptic plasticity in male cognition-impaired mice, but not in females. We conclude that striking sex differences in hippocampal synaptic plasticity are observed in mice, related to differences in PPARα expression levels.
Five new ergostanes, penicisteroids D-H (1-5), were isolated from the liquid culture of the deep-sea-derived fungus Penicillium granulatum MCCC 3A00475, along with 27 known compounds. The structures of the new steroids were established mainly on the basis of extensive analysis of 1D and 2D NMR as well as HRESIMS data. Moreover, the absolute configurations of 1 were confirmed unambiguously by the single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Compounds 2 and 4⁻7 showed moderate antiproliferative effects selectively against 12 different cancer cell lines with IC50 values of around 5 μM. Compounds 2 and 6, potent RXRα binders with Kd values of 13.8 and 12.9 μM, respectively, could induce apoptosis by a Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)-α-dependent mechanism by regulating RXRα transcriptional expression and promoting the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, they could inhibit proliferation by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.
Hepatic stellate cells are liver-specific perivascular cells, identified as the major source of collagen in liver fibrosis, following their activation and conversion to myofibroblast-like cells. Lycopene is a carotenoid with biological activities and protective effects described in different pathologies, but little is known about its role in liver protection. We evaluated the influence of lycopene on the cell cycle and lipid metabolism and monitored the possible pathways involved in lycopene inhibition of stellate cell activation. Lycopene induced expression of the lipocyte phenotype, with an accumulation of fat droplets in cytoplasm, with high synthesis and turnover of phospholipids and triglycerides. Cell proliferation analysis showed that lycopene reduced the growth of GRX cells. Lycopene induced an arrest in the G0/G1 phase, followed by a decrease of cells in the G2/M phase, regardless of the concentration of lycopene used. Lycopene modulated relevant signaling pathways related to cholesterol metabolism, cellular proliferation, and lipid metabolism. Also, lycopene treatment increased the expression of RXR-α, RXR-β, and PPARγ, important biomarkers of liver regeneration. These results show that lycopene was able to negatively modulate events related to the activation of hepatic stellate cells through mechanisms that involve changes in expression of cellular lipid metabolism factors, and suggest that this compound might provide a novel pharmacological approach for the prevention and treatment of fibrotic liver diseases.
Macrophages play important and diverse roles during cancer progression. However, cancer therapies based on macrophage modulation are lacking in tools that can recognize and deliver therapeutic payloads to macrophages in a tumor-specific manner. As a result, treatments tend to interfere with normal macrophage functions in healthy organs. We previously identified a macrophage-binding peptide, termed CRV. Here, we show that upon systemic administration into tumor-bearing mice, CRV selectively homes to tumors, extravasates, and preferentially binds to macrophages within. CRV exhibits a higher affinity for tumor macrophages than for other cells in tumors or for other macrophage types elsewhere in the body. We further identified and validated retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB) as the CRV receptor. Intriguingly, although it is known as a nuclear receptor, RXRB shows a prominent cell surface localization that is largely restricted to tumor macrophages. Systemic administration of anti-RXRB antibodies also results in tumor-selective binding to macrophages similar to CRV. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of CRV to improve the delivery of nano-carriers into solid tumors and macrophages within. In summary, we describe here a novel cell surface marker and targeting tools for tumor macrophages that may aid in future development of macrophage-modulatory cancer therapies.
The cytotoxicity of two recently synthesized triorganotin isothiocyanate derivatives, nuclear retinoid X receptor ligands, was tested and compared in estrogen-receptor-positive MCF 7 and -negative MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cell lines. A 48 h MTT assay indicated that tributyltin isothiocyanate (TBT-ITC) is more cytotoxic than triphenyltin isothiocyanate (TPT-ITC) in MCF 7 cells, and the same trend was observed in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. A comet assay revealed the presence of both crosslinks and increasing DNA damage levels after the 17 h treatment with both derivatives. Differences in cytotoxicity of TBT-ITC and TPT-ITC detected by FDA staining correspond to the MTT data, communicating more pronounced effects in MCF 7 than in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Both derivatives were found to cause apoptosis, as shown by the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization and caspase-3/7 activation. The onset of caspase activation correlated with MMP dissipation and the total cytotoxicity more than with the amount of active caspases. In conclusion, our data suggest that the DNA damage induced by TBT-ITC and TPT-ITC treatment could underlie their cytotoxicity in the cell lines studied.
Organotin anticancer agent di-n-butyl-di-(4-chlorobenzohydroxamato)tin(iv) (DBDCT) exerted an inhibitory effect on its major metabolic enzyme cytochrome CYP3A. But whether hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and their regulatory nuclear receptors including pregnane PXR and constitutive androstane CAR binding with retinoid receptor RXR as a heterodimer are involved in the DBDCT-mediated regulation of CYP3A remains unclear. This study was undertaken to determine the mechanisms responsible for the effects of DBDCT on CYP3A suppression, focusing on the PXR-mediated and NF-κB pathways. The results indicated DBDCT suppressed CYP3A expression by inhibiting CAR expression. But what's interesting is, both protein and mRNA of PXR increased with increasing DBDCT. A further exploration, dual luciferase reporter gene analysis, clarified that DBDCT induced CYP3A expression elevation via the PXR-mediated pathway and this induction was countered by activation of NF-κB, which played a pivotal role in suppression of CYP3A through disrupting the association of the PXR-RXRα complex with DNA sequences by EMSA. PXR-mediated CYP3A expression was similarly demonstrated by RNAi. As expected, expression of CYP3A and its mRNA levels were reduced by DBDCT only in NF-κB(+/+) but not in NF-κB(-/-) cells. The inductive effect of DBDCT on CYP3A4 mRNA was enhanced in PXR shRNA-transfected cells but weakened in the ip65 group, which showed both PXR up-regulated CYP3A expression and NF-κB p65 activation directly contributed to CYP3A inhibition. In conclusion, activated NF-κB by DBDCT interacts directly with the DNA-binding domain of PXR, and disrupts the binding between the PXR-RXR dimer, thereby affecting the regulatory process for CYP3A transcription and, therefore, leading to a decrease of the expression of the PXR-regulated CYP3A.
Malignant melanoma was the leading cause of mortality among the skin-associated cancer owing to its highly metastatic feature, increasing incidence and drug resistance requirement. Retinoids played important roles in the treatment of cancer via the activation of retinoid acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR). Our present study showed that the third-generation retinoid adapalene exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the proliferation of melanoma cells than other retinoids, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), isotretinoin, acitretin and bexarotene, and adapalene exerted significant inhibitory effects on the colony formation of melanoma cells. Further study confirmed that adapalene treatment triggered dramatic S phase arrest and apoptosis, and S phase arrest was the potential mechanism of apoptosis induction. In addition, adapalene treatment dramatically regulated the expression of S phase-related protein, and increased the protein level of DNA damage marker，which were consistent with the results of the induction of the tail moment in comet assays. Meanwhile, DNA damage response was activated and the DNA repair pathway was simultaneously inhibited by adapalene treatment, which might furtherly potentiate S phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Taken together, these results showed that adapalene exhibited strong anti-cancer activity, and might be a candidate agent for the clinical treatment of melanoma.
Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single-cell RNA sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find up-regulation of prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lungs expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A (Nur77), with prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib abrogates prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, prolactin, and prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine cross-talk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression.
Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals have been observed in natural aquatic environments around the world, and many have been shown to impact fish health. Presently, we examined the influence of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Na+ or Ca2+ on the bioavailability and toxicity of waterborne pharmaceuticals in larval zebrafish. Drugs included sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; SSRI), fluoxetine (SSRI), diclofenac (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and ethinyl estradiol (estrogen; EE2). The 96 h-LC50s for sertraline, fluoxetine and diclofenac were influenced by pH over an environmentally relevant range (pH 5.8-8.2). Toxicity was related to the predicted concentration of non-ionized compounds, which more readily cross cell membranes than ionized compounds. For example, sertraline was 4.1-fold more toxic (as measured by 96 h-LC50s) at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8, while the predicted amount of non-ionized sertraline was also greater at pH 8.2 (based on previously reported pKa values). Experiments with radiolabelled drugs demonstrated that sertraline uptake was also 5.4-fold higher at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8. Terrigenous and autochthonous DOC samples (as low as 1 mg/L) protected against sertraline uptake and toxicity, although they were more effective at lower (environmentally relevant) drug concentrations. In contrast, the uptake of EE2, which was principally non-ionized in all water chemistries tested, was not altered by pH or DOC. There was no change in sertraline toxicity with the addition of 12 mM Na+ or 3 mM Ca2+. In conclusion, the influence of pH and DOC on drug uptake and toxicity in fish appears to be predictable based on the physicochemical properties of the drug (e.g. pKa, polar surface area). The influence of water chemistry on drug bioavailability in fish is likely relevant to all aquatic life.
An inflammatory response induced by high glucose is a cause of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes and is an important contributing link to atherosclerosis. Diabetes is an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis and activation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) has been shown to exert anti-atherogenic effects. In the present study, we examined the effects of the RXR ligands 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and SR11237 on high glucose-induced inflammation in human umbilical endothelial vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and explored the potential mechanism. Our results showed that the inflammation induced by high-glucose in HUVECs was mainly mediated by the activation of nuclear factor-B (NF- κB). High glucose-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were in comparison, significantly decreased by treatment with RXR. The effect of RXR agonists was mainly due to the inhibition of NF-κB activation. Using pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA, we confirmed that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase was an upstream activator of NF-κB. Furthermore, RXR agonists significantly inhibited high glucose-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and significantly decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To explore whether the rapid inhibitory effects of RXR agonists were in fact mediated by RXR, we examined the effect of RXR downregulation by RXR siRNA. Our results showed that RXR siRNA largely abrogated the effects of RXR agonists, suggesting the requirement of RXR expression. Therefore, we have shown that RXR is involved in the regulation of NADPH oxidase- NF-κB signal pathway, as the RXR ligands antagonized the inflammatory response in HUVECs induced by high glucose. 
The collagenolytic effects of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) leading to extracellular matrix degradation are clearly involved in the physiopathology of human foetal membranes rupture. Nevertheless, the regulation of t-PA gene expression in extraembryonic developmental contexts remains unknown. The aim of our study is to propose the retinoic acids (RAs) as molecular regulators of t-PA expression in foetal membranes. RA induced t-PA mRNA and proteins in a time-dependent manner in amniotic membrane explants and Wistar Institute Susan Hayflick (WISH) cells. Furthermore, the use of cycloheximide revealed a two-step regulation of t-PA gene. Gene reporter assays confirmed that the RA-induced t-PA gene expression occurred through interactions of retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) with a DR5 response element located at -7 kb from the transcription site. Site-directed mutagenesis of this region of the t-PA promoter showed that SP1 factor was also retinoid-mediated induction, and immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SP1 and RAR/RXR interacted physically. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that interactions between RARs, RXRs and t-PA promoter were time dependent: RAR-alpha/RXR-alpha bound DR5 motif before and up to 12 hrs of RA exposure, and RAR-beta/RXR-alpha bound DR5 response element after 12 hrs of RA treatment. Finally, experiments using shRNA and RAR-beta-specific antagonist revealed that reducing RAR-beta induction decreased t-PA induction. Altogether, our results established that the RA-mediated regulation of t-PA in human foetal membranes occurred through two steps, with a major role played by RAR-beta.
Diabetes contributes to atherosclerosis partially through induction of oxidative stress. Both vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists exhibit anti-atherogenic effects.
We explored the effects of combination treatment with VDR and RXR agonists (represented by calcitriol and bexarotene, respectively) on atherosclerosis progression and the mechanisms involved, using a diabetes model of mice. The animals were intragastrically fed calcitriol (200 ng/kg, twice-a-week), bexarotene (10 mg/kg, once-daily) either alone or in combination for 12 weeks.
VDR and RXR agonists delayed atherosclerosis progression independent of serum lipid and glucose levels, and significantly reduced the protein expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit gp91phox and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p65, as well as plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Combination therapy alleviated atherosclerosis and inhibited indexes of oxidative stress and inflammation to a greater extent than either monotherapy. In the in vitro study, naturally occurring VDR ligand 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3) and RXR ligand 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), both significantly inhibited high-glucose-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Co-administration of VDR and RXR ligands produced synergistic protection against endothelial apoptosis by antagonizing the protein kinase C /NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species pathway. The inhibitory effects of 9-cis-RA on oxidative stress was attenuated when VDR was downregulated by VDR siRNA; however, downregulation of RXR by RXR siRNA imposed no influence on the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3.
Combination treatment with VDR and RXR agonists synergistically alleviated diabetic atherosclerosis through inhibition of oxidative stress, and the preventive effects of RXR agonist may partially depend on VDR activation.
Uveal melanoma (UM) is recognized as the most common intraocular malignancy and the second most common form of melanoma. Nearly 50% of UM patients develop untreatable and fatal metastases. The 48-member nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily represents a therapeutically targetable group of transcription factors known for their regulation of key cancer pathways in numerous tumor types. Here, we profiled the expression of the 48 human NRs by qRT-PCR across a melanoma cell line panel including 5 UM lines, 9 cutaneous melanoma (CM) lines, and normal primary melanocytes. NR expression patterns identified a few key features. First, in agreement with our past studies identifying RXRg as a CM-specific marker, we found that UM cells also exhibit high levels of RXRg expression, making it a universal biomarker for melanoma tumors. Second, we found that LXRb is highly expressed in both UM and CM lines, suggesting that it may be a therapeutic target in a UM metastatic setting as it has been in CM models. Third, we found that RARg, PPARd, EAR2, RXRa, and TRa expressions could subdivide UM from CM. Previous studies of UM cancers identified key mutations in three genes: GNAQ, GNA11, and BRAF. We found unique NR expression profiles associated with each of these UM mutations. We then performed NR-to-NR and NR-to-genome expression correlation analyses to find potential NR-driven transcriptional programs activated in UM and CM. Specifically, RXRg controlled gene networks were identified that may drive melanoma-specific signaling and metabolism. ERRa was identified as a UM-defining NR and genes correlated with its expression confirm the role of ERRa in metabolic control. Given the plethora of available NR agonists, antagonists, and selective receptor modulators, pharmacologic manipulation of these NRs and their transcriptional outputs may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of key UM pathways and how we can leverage them for better therapeutic alternatives. 
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been postulated to increase the risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Adipose tissue (AT) plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis, and AT dysfunction has an active role in metabolic diseases. MetS is closely related to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epigenetics has emerged as an interesting landscape to evaluate the possible interconnection between AT and metabolic disease, since it can be modulated by environmental factors and metabolic status. The aim of this study was to determine whether MetS has an impact on the global DNA methylation pattern and the DNA methylation of several genes related to adipogenesis (PPARG, PPARA), lipid metabolism (RXRA, SREBF2, SREBF1, SCD, LPL, LXRb), and inflammation (LRP1 C3, LEP and TNF) in visceral adipose tissue. LPL and TNF DNA methylation values were significantly different in the control-case comparisons, with higher and lower methylation respectively in the MetS group. Negative correlations were found between global DNA methylation (measured by LINE-1 methylation levels) and the metabolic deterioration and glucose levels. There were associations among variables of MetS, BMI, and HOMA-IR with DNA methylation at several CpG positions for the studied genes. In particular, there was a strong positive association between serum triglyceride levels (TG) with PPARA and LPL methylation levels. TNF methylation was negatively associated with the metabolic worsening and could be an important factor in preventing MetS occurrence according to logistic regression analysis. Therefore, global DNA methylation and methylation at specific genes related to adipogenesis, lipid metabolism and inflammation are related to the etiology of MetS and might explain in part some of the features associated to metabolic disorders.
The signals that determine atherosclerosis-specific DNA methylation profiles are only partially known. We previously identified a 29-bp DNA motif (differential methylation motif [DMM]) proximal to CpG islands (CGIs) that undergo demethylation in advanced human atheromas. Those data hinted that the DMM docks modifiers of DNA methylation and transcription.
We sought to functionally characterize the DMM. We showed that the DMM overlaps with the RNA polymerase III-binding B box of Alu short interspersed nuclear elements and contains a DR2 nuclear receptor response element. Pointing to a possible functional role for an Alu DMM, CGIs proximal (&lt;100 bp) to near-intact DMM-harboring Alu are significantly less methylated relative to CGIs proximal to degenerate DMM-harboring Alu or to DMM-devoid mammalian-wide interspersed repeat short interspersed nuclear elements in human arteries. As for DMM-binding factors, LXRB (liver X receptor β) binds the DMM in a DR2-dependent fashion, and LXR (liver X receptor) agonists induce significant hypermethylation of the bulk of Alu in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, we describe 3 intergenic long noncoding RNAs that harbor a DMM, are under transcriptional control by LXR agonists, and are differentially expressed between normal and atherosclerotic human aortas. Notably, CGIs adjacent to those long noncoding RNAs tend to be hypomethylated in symptomatic relative to stable human atheromas.
Collectively, the data suggest that a DMM is associated with 2 distinct methylation states: relatively low methylation of in cis CGIs and Alu element hypermethylation. Based on the known atheroprotective role of LXRs, we propose that LXR agonist-induced Alu hypermethylation, a landmark of atherosclerosis, is a compensatory rather than proatherogenic response.
The Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) is a transcription factor ubiquitously expressed in the brain. Activation of brain GRs by high levels of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones modifies a large variety of physiological and pathological-related behaviors. Unfortunately the specific cellular targets of GR-mediated behavioral effects of GC are still largely unknown. To address this issue, we generated a mutated form of the GR called DeltaGR. DeltaGR is a constitutively transcriptionally active form of the GR that is localized in the nuclei and activates transcription without binding to glucocorticoids. Using the tetracycline-regulated system (Tet-OFF), we developed an inducible transgenic approach that allows the expression of the DeltaGR in specific brain areas. We focused our study on a mouse line that expressed DeltaGR almost selectively in the glutamatergic neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. This restricted expression of the DeltaGR increased anxiety-related behaviors without affecting other behaviors that could indirectly influence performance in anxiety-related tests. This behavioral phenotype was also associated with an up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway and Egr-1 protein in the DG. These findings identify glutamatergic neurons in the DG as one of the cellular substrate of stress-related pathologies.
Prostate apoptosis response factor-4 (Par-4) is an ubiquitously expressed pro-apoptotic and tumour suppressive protein that can both activate cell-death mechanisms and inhibit pro-survival factors. Par-4 contains a highly conserved coiled-coil region that serves as the primary recognition domain for a large number of binding partners. Par-4 is also tightly regulated by the aforementioned binding partners and by post-translational modifications. Biophysical data obtained in the present study indicate that Par-4 primarily comprises an intrinsically disordered protein. Bioinformatic analysis of the highly conserved Par-4 reveals low sequence complexity and enrichment in polar and charged amino acids. The high proteolytic susceptibility and an increased hydrodynamic radius are consistent with a largely extended structure in solution. Spectroscopic measurements using CD and NMR also reveal characteristic features of intrinsic disorder. Under physiological conditions, the data obtained show that Par-4 self-associates via the C-terminal domain, forming a coiled-coil. Interruption of self-association by urea also resulted in loss of secondary structure. These results are consistent with the stabilization of the coiled-coil motif through an intramolecular association.
YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor implicated in both positive and negative regulation of gene expression as well as in initiation of transcription. We show that YY1 is ubiquitously expressed in growing, differentiated, and growth-arrested cells. The protein is phosphorylated and has a half-life of 3.5 h. To define functional domains, we have generated a large panel of YY1 mutant proteins. These were used to define precisely the DNA-binding domain, the region responsible for nuclear localization, and the transactivation domain. The two acidic domains at the N terminus each provide about half of the transcriptional activating activity. Furthermore, the spacer region between the Gly/Ala-rich and zinc finger domains has accessory function in transactivation. YY1 has been shown previously to bind to TAFII55, TATA box-binding protein, transcription factor IIB, and p300. In addition, we identified cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CBP)-binding protein as a YY1 binding partner. Surprisingly, these proteins did not bind to the domains involved in transactivation, but rather to the zinc finger and Gly/Ala-rich domains of YY1. Thus, these proteins do not explain the transcriptional activating activity of YY1, but rather may be involved in repression or in initiation.
Intracellular signaling events are often organized around PDZ (PSD-95/Drosophila Disc large/ZO-1 homology) domain-containing scaffolding proteins. The ubiquitously expressed multi-PDZ protein MUPP1, which is composed of 13 PDZ domains, has been shown to interact with multiple viral and cellular proteins and to play important roles in receptor targeting and trafficking. In this study, we show that MUPP1 binds to the G protein-coupled MT(1) melatonin receptor and directly regulates its G(i)-dependent signal transduction. Structural determinants involved in this interaction are the PDZ10 domain of MUPP1 and the valine of the canonical class III PDZ domain binding motif DSV of the MT(1) carboxyl terminus. This high affinity interaction (K(d) approximately 4 nm), which is independent of MT(1) activation, occurs in the ovine pars tuberalis of the pituitary expressing both proteins endogenously. Although the disruption of the MT(1)/MUPP1 interaction has no effect on the subcellular localization, trafficking, or degradation of MT(1), it destabilizes the interaction between MT(1) and G(i) and abolishes G(i)-mediated signaling of MT(1). Our findings highlight a previously unappreciated role of PDZ proteins in promoting G protein coupling to receptors.
The non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is frequently associated with a t(2;5)(p23;q35) that results in the fusion of the ubiquitously expressed nucleophosmin (NPM) gene at 5q35 to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23, which is not normally expressed in hematopoietic tissues. Approximately 20% of ALCLs that express ALK do not contain the t(2;5), suggesting that other genetic abnormalities can result in aberrant ALK expression. Here we report the molecular characterization of an alternative genetic means of ALK activation, the inv(2)(p23q35). This recurrent abnormality produces a fusion of the amino-terminus of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), a bifunctional homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate and final steps of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, with the intracellular portion of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase. RT-PCR analysis of 5 ALCL tumors that contained the inv(2) revealed identical ATIC-ALK fusion cDNA junctions in all of the cases. Transient expression studies show that the ATIC-ALK fusion transcript directs the synthesis of an approximately 87-kd chimeric protein that is localized to the cytoplasm, in contrast to NPM-ALK, which typically exhibits a cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular distribution. ATIC-ALK was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and could convert the IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line BaF3 to cytokine-independent growth. Our studies demonstrate an alternative mechanism for ALK involvement in the genesis of NHL and suggest that ATIC-ALK activation results from ATIC-mediated homodimerization. In addition, expected decreases in ATIC enzymatic function in ATIC-ALK-containing lymphomas may render these tumors more sensitive to antifolate drugs such as methotrexate. (Blood. 2000;95:2144-2149)
It is now well established that the human brain continuously produces new stem cells until well into old age. One of these stem-cell rich areas in the human brain is the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). The human SVZ is organized in four distinctive layers containing type A, B and C cells. To date, no studies have investigated the distribution of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their respective receptors on the different cell types in the human SVZ. GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) are ubiquitously expressed, inhibitory heteropentameric chloride ion channels comprised of a variety of subunits that are targeted by many prescribed drugs. In this study we present detailed immunohistochemical data on the regional and cellular localization of α₁, α₂, α3, β₂,₃ and γ₂ subunits of GABA(A)R in the human SVZ. The results from our double and triple labeling studies demonstrate that the cell types and subunit composition throughout the SVZ is heterogeneous; the thickness of the SVZ and GABA(A)R α₂ and γ₂ expression is increased especially in the vicinity of large SVZ blood vessels. GABA(A)R γ₂ is the most specific to the SVZ and present on various cells that express, either glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAPδ) or polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) separately, or together in a respective ratio of 7:6:2. Proliferating (type C) cells in the SVZ express GAD65/67, GFAPδ and GABA(A)R β₂,₃ receptor subunits. Within the SVZ the majority of cells have an unexpected nuclear GABA(A)R β₂,₃ expression that is inversely proportional to that of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen marker), which is a very different pattern of expression compared with underlying caudate nucleus cells. Taken together our results provide a detailed description of the chemo-architecture of the adult human SVZ demonstrating the importance of GABA and GABA(A) receptors on the various cell types in the SVZ.
Glucocorticoids are vital for life and regulate an array of physiological functions by binding to the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR, also known as NR3C1). Previous studies demonstrate striking breed differences in plasma cortisol levels in pigs. However, investigation into the breed-dependent GR transcriptional regulation is hampered by lacking porcine GR promoter information. In this study, we sequenced 5.3 kb upstream of the translation start codon of the porcine GR gene, and identified seven alternative 5'-untranslated exons 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9,10 and 1-11. Among all these mRNA variants, exons 1-4 and 1-5, as well as the total GR were expressed significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in the liver of newborn piglets of Large White (LW) compared with Erhualian, a Chinese indigenous breed. Overall level of CpG methylation in the region flanking exons 1-4 and 1-5 did not show breed difference. However, nuclear content of Sp1, p-CREB and GR in the liver was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in LW piglets, associated with enhanced binding of p-CREB, and higher level of histone H3 acetylation in 1-4 and 1-5 promoters. In contrast, GR binding to promoters of exons 1-4 and 1-5 was significantly diminished in LW piglets, implicating the presence of negative GREs. These results indicate that the difference in the hepatic expression of GR transcript variants between two breeds of pigs is determined, at least partly, by the disparity in the binding of transcription factors and the enrichment of histone H3 acetylation to the promoters.
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors (IP(3)Rs) are large, ubiquitously expressed, endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins that form tetrameric IP(3) and Ca(2+)-gated Ca(2+) channels. Endogenous IP(3)Rs provide very appealing tools for studying the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in intact mammalian cells because, upon activation, they are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined the ubiquitination of IP(3)R1 in αT3-1 pituitary gonadotrophs and found that IP(3)R1 ubiquitination is highly complex, with receptors being modified at multiple sites by monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains formed through both Lys-48 and Lys-63 linkages (Sliter, D. A., Kubota, K., Kirkpatrick, D. S., Alzayady, K. J., Gygi, S. P., and Wojcikiewicz, R. J. H. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 35319-35328). Here, we have extended these studies to determine whether IP(3)R2 and IP(3)R3 are similarly modified and if ubiquitination is cell type-dependent. Using mass spectrometry and linkage-specific ubiquitin antibodies, we found that all IP(3)R types are subject to ubiquitination at approximately the same locations and that, independent of cell type, IP(3)Rs are modified by monoubiquitin and Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, although in differing proportions. Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation. Together, these data provide unique insight into the complexities of ubiquitination of an endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway substrate in unperturbed mammalian cells. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation.
High altitude environments are of particular interest in the studies of local adaptation as well as their implications in physiology and clinical medicine in human. Some Chinese pig breeds, such as Tibetan pig (TBP) that is well adapted to the high altitude and Dahe pig (DHP) that dwells at the moderate altitude, provide ideal materials to study local adaptation to altitudes. Yet, it is still short of in-depth analysis and understanding of the genetic adaptation to high altitude in the two pig populations. In this study we conducted a genomic scan for selective sweeps using FST to identify genes showing evidence of local adaptations in TBP and DHP, with Wuzhishan pig (WZSP) as the low-altitude reference. Totally, we identified 12 specific selective genes (CCBE1, F2RL1, AGGF1, ZFPM2, IL2, FGF5, PLA2G4A, ADAMTS9, NRBF2, JMJD1C, VEGFC and ADAM19) for TBP and six (OGG1, FOXM, FLT3, RTEL1, CRELD1 and RHOG) for DHP. In addition, six selective genes (VPS13A, GNA14, GDAP1, PARP8, FGF10 and ADAMTS16) were shared by the two pig breeds. Among these selective genes, three (VEGFC, FGF10 and ADAMTS9) were previously reported to be linked to the local adaptation to high altitudes in pigs, while many others were newly identified by this study. Further bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that majority of these selective signatures have some biological functions relevant to the altitude adaptation, for examples, response to hypoxia, development of blood vessels, DNA repair and several hematological involvements. These results suggest that the local adaptation to high altitude environments is sophisticated, involving numerous genes and multiple biological processes, and the shared selective signatures by the two pig breeds may provide an effective avenue to identify the common adaptive mechanisms to different altitudes. 
Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stresses. Beclin 1 and its interacting proteins, including the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase Vps34, play crucial roles in autophagy regulation in mammals. We identified nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (Nrbf2) as a Beclin 1-interacting protein from Becn1(-/-);Becn1-EGFP/+ mouse liver and brain. We also found that Nrbf2-Beclin 1 interaction required the N terminus of Nrbf2. We next used the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE-1 as a model system and showed that transiently knocking down Nrbf2 by siRNA increased autophagic flux under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions. To investigate the mechanism by which Nrbf2 regulates autophagy, we demonstrated that Nrbf2 interacted and colocalized with Atg14L, suggesting that Nrbf2 is a component of the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 complex. Moreover, ectopically expressed Nrbf2 formed cytosolic puncta that were positive for isolation membrane markers. These results suggest that Nrbf2 is involved in autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we showed that Nrbf2 deficiency led to increased intracellular phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate levels and diminished Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions, suggesting that Nrbf2-mediated Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions likely inhibit Vps34 activity. Therefore, we propose that Nrbf2 may interact with the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 protein complex to modulate protein-protein interactions within the complex, leading to suppression of Vps34 activity, autophagosome biogenesis, and autophagic flux. This work reveals a novel aspect of the intricate mechanism for the Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network to achieve precise control of autophagy. 
The Beclin 1-Vps34 complex, the core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K-III), binds Atg14L or UVRAG to control different steps of autophagy. However, the mechanism underlying the control of PI3K-III activity remains elusive. Here we report the identification of NRBF2 as a component in the specific PI3K-III complex and a modulator of PI3K-III activity. Through its microtubule interaction and trafficking (MIT) domain, NRBF2 binds Atg14L directly and enhances Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase activity and autophagy induction. NRBF2-deficient cells exhibit enhanced vulnerability to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that is reversed by re-introducing exogenous NRBF2. NRBF2-deficient mice develop focal liver necrosis and ductular reaction, accompanied by impaired Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity and autophagy, although the mice show no increased mortality. Our data reveal a key role for NRBF2 in the assembly of the specific Atg14L-Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 complex for autophagy induction. Thus, NRBF2 modulates autophagy via regulation of PI3K-III and prevents ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity and liver injury. 
Omega6 (n6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites are involved in cell signaling, inflammation, clot formation, and other crucial biological processes. Genetic components, such as variants of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes, determine the composition of n6 PUFAs.
To elucidate undiscovered biological pathways that may influence n6 PUFA composition, we conducted genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses of associations of common genetic variants with 6 plasma n6 PUFAs in 8631 white adults (55% women) across 5 prospective studies. Plasma phospholipid or total plasma fatty acids were analyzed by similar gas chromatography techniques. The n6 fatty acids linoleic acid (LA), γ-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-GLA, arachidonic acid, and adrenic acid were expressed as percentage of total fatty acids. We performed linear regression with robust SEs to test for single-nucleotide polymorphism-fatty acid associations, with pooling using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Novel regions were identified on chromosome 10 associated with LA (rs10740118; P=8.1×10(-9); near NRBF2), on chromosome 16 with LA, GLA, dihomo-GLA, and arachidonic acid (rs16966952; P=1.2×10(-15), 5.0×10(-11), 7.6×10(-65), and 2.4×10(-10), respectively; NTAN1), and on chromosome 6 with adrenic acid after adjustment for arachidonic acid (rs3134950; P=2.1×10(-10); AGPAT1). We confirmed previous findings of the FADS cluster on chromosome 11 with LA and arachidonic acid, and further observed novel genome-wide significant association of this cluster with GLA, dihomo-GLA, and adrenic acid (P=2.3×10(-72), 2.6×10(-151), and 6.3×10(-140), respectively).
Our findings suggest that along with the FADS gene cluster, additional genes may influence n6 PUFA composition.
A protein named nuclear receptor binding factor-2 (NRBF-2) was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening, as an interaction partner of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha as well as several other nuclear receptors. NRBF-2 exhibited a gene activation function, when tethered to a heterologous DNA binding domain, in both mammalian cells and yeast.
Macroautophagy is a physiological cellular response to nutrient stress, which leads to the engulfment of cytosolic contents by a double-walled membrane structure, the phagophore. Phagophores seal to become autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to deliver their contents for degradation. Macroautophagy is regulated by numerous cellular factors, including the Class III PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) Vps34 (vacuolar protein sorting 34). The autophagic functions of Vps34 require its recruitment to a complex that includes Vps15, Beclin-1 and Atg14L (autophagy-related 14-like protein) and is known as Vps34 Complex I. We have now identified NRBF2 (nuclear receptor-binding factor 2) as a new member of Vps34 Complex I. NRBF2 binds to complexes that include Vps34, Vps15, Beclin-1 and ATG-14L, but not the Vps34 Complex II component UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene). NRBF2 directly interacts with Vps15 via the Vps15 WD40 domain as well as other regions of Vps15. The formation of GFP-LC3 (light chain 3) punctae and PE (phosphatidylethanolamine)-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) in serum-starved cells was inhibited by NRBF2 knockdown in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors, and p62 levels were increased. Thus NRBF2 plays a critical role in the induction of starvation-induced autophagy as a specific member of Vps34 Complex I. 
We previously identified nuclear receptor binding protein 2 (NRBP2) in a screen for genes induced by differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. Here we show that during embryonic mouse brain development NRBP2 was expressed in the walls of the third and fourth ventricles, and in the hippocampus. In the adult brain, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were main sites of NRBP2 expression. Analysis of a pediatric medulloblastoma showed that clusters of NRBP2 positive tumor cells co-expressed neurofilament, but not GFAP. Thus, NRBP2 was associated with neuronal differentiation both in normal and malignant brain tissue. We report that NRBP2 is a 55-60 kDa protein with mainly cytoplasmic location. In vitro, NRBP2 protein levels increased as neural stem/progenitor cells differentiated, and its down regulation by siRNA rendered neural progenitor cells more vulnerable to apoptosis. NRBP2 has no previously assigned function and our studies suggest a role for NRBP2 in neural progenitor cell survival.
The class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1) is central to autophagy initiation. We previously reported the V-shaped architecture of the four-subunit version of PI3KC3-C1 consisting of VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) 34, VPS15, BECN1 (Beclin 1), and ATG (autophagy-related) 14. Here we show that a putative fifth subunit, nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (NRBF2), is a tightly bound component of the complex that profoundly affects its activity and architecture. NRBF2 enhances the lipid kinase activity of the catalytic subunit, VPS34, by roughly 10-fold. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry and negative-stain electron microscopy to map NRBF2 to the base of the V-shaped complex. NRBF2 interacts primarily with the N termini of ATG14 and BECN1. We show that NRBF2 is a homodimer and drives the dimerization of the larger PI3KC3-C1 complex, with implications for the higher-order organization of the preautophagosomal structure.
Epidemiological studies suggest that levels of n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with risk of cardio-metabolic outcomes across different ethnic groups. Recent genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry have identified several loci associated with plasma and/or erythrocyte polyunsaturated fatty acids. To identify additional novel loci, we carried out a genome-wide association study in two population-based cohorts consisting of 3521 Chinese participants, followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis with meta-analysis results from 8962 participants of European ancestry. Four novel loci (MYB, AGPAT4, DGAT2 and PPT2) reached genome-wide significance in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (log10(Bayes Factor) ≥ 6). Of them, associations of MYB and AGPAT4 with docosatetraenoic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 11.5 and 8.69, respectively) also reached genome-wide significance in the Chinese-specific genome-wide association analyses (P = 4.15 × 10(-14) and 4.30 × 10(-12), respectively), while associations of DGAT2 with gamma-linolenic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 6.16) and of PPT2 with docosapentaenoic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 6.24) were nominally significant in both Chinese- and European-specific genome-wide association analyses (P ≤ 0.003). We also confirmed previously reported loci including FADS1, NTAN1, NRBF2, ELOVL2 and GCKR. Different effect sizes in FADS1 and independent association signals in ELOVL2 were observed. These results provide novel insight into the genetic background of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their differences between Chinese and European populations. 
Autophagy is an important lysosomal degradation pathway that aids in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by breaking down and recycling intracellular contents. Dysregulation of autophagy is linked to a growing number of human diseases. The Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network is critical for autophagy regulation and is therefore essential to cellular integrity. Manipulation of autophagy, in particular via modulation of the action of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, is considered a promising route to combat autophagy-related diseases. Here we summarize recent findings on the core components and structural architecture of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, and how these findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the multiple functions of these complexes and for devising therapeutic strategies.
Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs near ZNF365 at 10q21.2 that are associated with both breast cancer risk and mammographic density. To identify the most likely causal SNPs, we fine mapped the association signal by genotyping 428 SNPs across the region in 89,050 European and 12,893 Asian case and control subjects from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We identified four independent sets of correlated, highly trait-associated variants (iCHAVs), three of which were located within ZNF365. The most strongly risk-associated SNP, rs10995201 in iCHAV1, showed clear evidence of association with both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (OR = 0.85 [0.82-0.88]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.87 [0.82-0.91]) disease, and was also the SNP most strongly associated with percent mammographic density. iCHAV2 (lead SNP, chr10: 64,258,684:D) and iCHAV3 (lead SNP, rs7922449) were also associated with ER-positive (OR = 0.93 [0.91-0.95] and OR = 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.95 [0.91-0.98] and OR = 1.08 [1.04-1.13]) disease. There was weaker evidence for iCHAV4, located 5' of ADO, associated only with ER-positive breast cancer (OR = 0.93 [0.90-0.96]). We found 12, 17, 18, and 2 candidate causal SNPs for breast cancer in iCHAVs 1-4, respectively. Chromosome conformation capture analysis showed that iCHAV2 interacts with the ZNF365 and NRBF2 (more than 600 kb away) promoters in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells. Luciferase assays did not identify SNPs that affect transactivation of ZNF365, but identified a protective haplotype in iCHAV2, associated with silencing of the NRBF2 promoter, implicating this gene in the etiology of breast cancer. 
Multi-subunit tethering complexes control membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells. Class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) and homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) are two such complexes, both containing the Sec1/Munc18 protein subunit VPS33A. Metazoans additionally possess VPS33B, which has considerable sequence similarity to VPS33A but does not integrate into CORVET or HOPS complexes and instead stably interacts with VIPAR. It has been recently suggested that VPS33B and VIPAR comprise two subunits of a novel multi-subunit tethering complex (named "CHEVI"), perhaps analogous in configuration to CORVET and HOPS. We utilized the BioID proximity biotinylation assay to compare and contrast the interactomes of VPS33A and VPS33B. Overall, few proteins were identified as associating with both VPS33A and VPS33B, suggesting that these proteins have distinct sub-cellular localizations. Consistent with previous reports, we observed that VPS33A was co-localized with many components of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complexes: PIK3C3, PIK3R4, NRBF2, UVRAG and RUBICON. Although VPS33A clearly co-localized with several subunits of CORVET and HOPS in this assay, no proteins with the canonical CORVET/HOPS domain architecture were found to co-localize with VPS33B. Instead, we identified that VPS33B interacts directly with CCDC22, a member of the CCC complex. CCDC22 does not co-fractionate with VPS33B and VIPAR in gel filtration of human cell lysates, suggesting that CCDC22 interacts transiently with VPS33B/VIPAR rather than forming a stable complex with these proteins in cells. We also observed that the protein complex containing VPS33B and VIPAR is considerably smaller than CORVET/HOPS, suggesting that the CHEVI complex comprises just VPS33B and VIPAR.
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaque in the brain. The autophagy-associated PIK3C3-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex has been shown to interfere with APP metabolism and amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) homeostasis via poorly understood mechanisms. Here we report that NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2), a key component and regulator of the PtdIns3K, is involved in APP-CTFs homeostasis in AD cell models. We found that NRBF2 interacts with APP in vivo and its expression levels are reduced in hippocampus of 5XFAD AD mice; we further demonstrated that NRBF2 overexpression promotes degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), and reduces Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in human mutant APP-overexpressing cells. Conversely, APP-CTFs, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels were increased in Nrbf2 knockdown or nrbf2 knockout cells. Furthermore, NRBF2 positively regulates autophagy in neuronal cells and NRBF2-mediated reduction of APP-CTFs levels is autophagy dependent. Importantly, nrbf2 knockout attenuates the recruitment of APP and APP-CTFs into phagophores and the sorting of APP and APP-CTFs into endosomal intralumenal vesicles, which is accompanied by the accumulation of the APP and APP-CTFs into RAB5-positive early endosomes. Collectively, our results reveal the potential connection between NRBF2 and the AD-associated protein APP by showing that NRBF2 plays an important role in regulating degradation of APP-CTFs through modulating autophagy.
NRBF2/Atg38 has been identified as the fifth subunit of the macroautophagic/autophagic class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex, along with ATG14/Barkor, BECN1/Vps30, PIK3R4/p150/Vps15 and PIK3C3/Vps34. However, its functional mechanism and regulation are not fully understood. Here, we report that NRBF2 is a fine tuning regulator of PtdIns3K controlled by phosphorylation. Human NRBF2 is phosphorylated by MTORC1 at S113 and S120. Upon nutrient starvation or MTORC1 inhibition, NRBF2 phosphorylation is diminished. Phosphorylated NRBF2 preferentially interacts with PIK3C3/PIK3R4. Suppression of NRBF2 phosphorylation by MTORC1 inhibition alters its binding preference from PIK3C3/PIK3R4 to ATG14/BECN1, leading to increased autophagic PtdIns3K complex assembly, as well as enhancement of ULK1 protein complex association. Consequently, NRBF2 in its unphosphorylated form promotes PtdIns3K lipid kinase activity and autophagy flux, whereas its phosphorylated form blocks them. This study reveals NRBF2 as a critical molecular switch of PtdIns3K and autophagy activation, and its on/off state is precisely controlled by MTORC1 through phosphorylation.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34 is part of several protein complexes. The structural organization of heterotetrameric complexes is starting to emerge, but little is known about organization of additional accessory subunits that interact with these assemblies. Combining hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM), we have characterized Atg38 and its human ortholog NRBF2, accessory components of complex I consisting of Vps15-Vps34-Vps30/Atg6-Atg14 (yeast) and PIK3R4/VPS15-PIK3C3/VPS34-BECN1/Beclin 1-ATG14 (human). HDX-MS shows that Atg38 binds the Vps30-Atg14 subcomplex of complex I, using mainly its N-terminal MIT domain and bridges the coiled-coil I regions of Atg14 and Vps30 in the base of complex I. The Atg38 C-terminal domain is important for localization to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) and homodimerization. Our 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of the Atg38 C-terminal homodimerization domain shows 2 segments of α-helices assembling into a mushroom-like asymmetric homodimer with a 4-helix cap and a parallel coiled-coil stalk. One Atg38 homodimer engages a single complex I. This is in sharp contrast to human NRBF2, which also forms a homodimer, but this homodimer can bridge 2 complex I assemblies.
Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in all major physiological functions of complex organisms. In this respect, they are often described as drugable targets for a number of pathological states including hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. HNF4alpha (NR2A1) is a recently 'deorphanized' nuclear receptor which is bound in vivo by linoleic acid, although this natural ligand does not seem to promote transcriptional activation. In mouse, HNF4alpha is a major regulator of liver development and hepatic lipid metabolism and mutations in human have been linked to diabetes. Here, we have used a yeast one-hybrid system to identify small molecule activators of HNF4alpha in a library of synthetic compounds and found one hit bearing a methoxy group branched on a nitronaphthofuran backbone. A collection of molecules deriving from the discovered hit was generated and tested for activity toward HNF4alpha in yeast one-hybrid system. It was found that both the nitro group and a complete naphthofuran backbone were required for full activity of the compounds. Furthermore, adding a hydroxy group at position 7 of the minimal backbone led to the most active compound of the collection. Accordingly, a direct interaction of the hydroxylated compound with the ligand binding domain of HNF4alpha was detected by NMR and thermal denaturation assays. When used in mammalian cell culture systems, these compounds proved to be highly toxic, except when methylated on the furan ring. One such compound was able to modulate HNF4alpha-driven transcription in transfected HepG2C3A cells. These data indicate that HNF4alpha activity can be modulated by small molecules and suggest new routes for targeting the receptor in humans.
The lactogenic hormones prolactin (PRL) and placental lactogens (PL) play central roles in reproduction and mammary development. Their actions are mediated via binding to PRL receptor (PRLR), highly expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), yet their impact on adipocyte function and metabolism remains unclear.
PRLR knockout (KO) newborn mice were phenotypically characterized in terms of thermoregulation and their BAT differentiation assayed for gene expression studies. Derived brown preadipocyte cell lines were established to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in PRL signaling on BAT function. Here, we report that newborn mice lacking PRLR have hypotrophic BAT depots that express low levels of adipocyte nuclear receptor PPARgamma2, its coactivator PGC-1alpha, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and the beta3 adrenoceptor, reducing mouse viability during cold challenge. Immortalized PRLR KO preadipocytes fail to undergo differentiation into mature adipocytes, a defect reversed by reintroduction of PRLR. That the effects of the lactogens in BAT are at least partly mediated by Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 (IGF-2) is supported by: i) a striking reduction in BAT IGF-2 expression in PRLR KO mice and in PRLR-deficient preadipocytes; ii) induction of cellular IGF-2 expression by PRL through JAK2/STAT5 pathway activation; and iii) reversal of defective differentiation in PRLR KO cells by exogenous IGF-2.
Our findings demonstrate that the lactogens act in concert with IGF-2 to control brown adipocyte differentiation and growth. Given the prominent role of brown adipose tissue during the perinatal period, our results identified prolactin receptor signaling as a major player and a potential therapeutic target in protecting newborn mammals against hypothermia.
Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) expression is upregulated in the orbits of patients with Graves ophthalmopathy (GO), most of whom have TSHR-stimulating antibodies. The authors investigated the biological effects of TSHR activation in vitro in adipose tissue, the site of orbital TSHR expression.
Activating mutant TSHR (TSHR*) or wild-type (WT) was introduced into human orbital preadipocytes using retroviral vectors. Their proliferation (Coulter counting), basal cAMP accumulation (radioimmunoassay), and spontaneous and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma)-induced adipogenesis (quantitative oil red O staining) were assessed and compared with those of nonmodified cells. QRT-PCR was used to measure transcripts of CCAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)beta, PPARgamma, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL; early, intermediate, and late markers of adipogenesis) and for uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 (brown adipose tissue [BAT]).
Expression of TSHR* significantly inhibited the proliferation of preadipocytes and produced an increase in unstimulated cAMP of 200% to 600%. Basal lipid levels were significantly increased in TSHR* (127%-275%) compared with nonmodified (100%) or WT-expressing (104%-187%) cells. This was accompanied by 2- to 10-fold increases in early-intermediate markers and UCP-1 transcripts (2- to 8-fold); LPL was at the limit of detection. In nonmodified cells, adipogenesis produced significant increases in transcripts of all markers, including LPL (approximately 30-fold). This was not the case in TSHR*-expressing cells, which also displayed 67% to 84% reductions in lipid levels.
TSHR activation stimulates early differentiation (favoring BAT formation?) but renders preadipocytes refractory to PPARgamma-induced adipogenesis. In neither case did lipid-containing vacuoles accumulate, suggesting that terminal stages of differentiation were inhibited.
Acute cold exposure leads to norepinephrine release in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and activates uncoupling protein (UCP)1-mediated nonshivering thermogenesis. Chronic sympathetic stimulation is known to initiate mitochondrial biogenesis, UCP1 expression, hyperplasia of BAT, and recruitment of brown adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) depots. Despite distinct functions of BAT and WAT in energy balance, only a few genes are exclusively expressed in either tissue. We identified NUR77 (Nr4a1), an orphan receptor, to be induced transiently in brown adipocytes in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation and in BAT of cold-exposed mice. Subsequent reporter gene assays demonstrated an inhibitory action of NUR77 on basal and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma/retinoid X receptor (RXR)alpha-mediated transactivation of the Ucp1 enhancer in heterologous cotransfection experiments. Despite this function of NUR77 in the control of Ucp1 gene expression, nonshivering thermogenesis was not affected in Nur77 knockout mice. However, we observed a superinduction of Nor1 in BAT of cold-exposed knockout mice. We conclude that NUR77 is a cold-induced negative regulator of Ucp1, but phenotypic consequences in knockout mice are compensated by functional redundancy of Nor1.
To clarify the genetic background of ampullary neoplasm, we investigated the occurrence of microsatellite instability (MSI) in 64 samples of neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater. Eight out of 22 adenomas (34.6%), nine out of 32 carcinomas (28.1%) and one metastatic lesion (10.0%) showed MSI in 1-3 of the nine dinucleotide markers; those cases are categorized into microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L). The remaining samples were stable with respect to all of the tested markers. None of the samples showed a frameshift mutation in the poly A-tract of BAT-26 or transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor, which are frequently mutated in gastric or colorectal cancers showing microsatellite instability. To confirm our finding, we stained 93 ampullary neoplasms with antibodies against the mismatch repair proteins: hMLH1 and hMSH2. All tumors were found to express mismatch repair proteins. In contrast to gastric or colorectal cancers, MSI does not play an important role in the carcinogenesis of ampullary carcinoma.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) regulates bile acid and lipid homeostasis by acting as an intracellular bile acid-sensing transcription factor. Several identified FXR target genes serve critical roles in the synthesis and transport of bile acids as well as in lipid metabolism. Here we used Affymetrix micro-array and Northern analysis to demonstrate that two enzymes involved in conjugation of bile acids to taurine and glycine, namely bile acid-CoA synthetase (BACS) and bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAT) are induced by FXR in rat liver. Analysis of the human BACS and BAT genes revealed the presence of functional response elements in the proximal promoter of BACS and in the intronic region between exons 1 and 2 of the BAT gene. The response elements resemble the consensus FXR binding site consisting of two nuclear receptor half-sites organized as an inverted repeat and separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1). These response elements directly bind FXR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers and confer the activity of FXR ligands in transient transfection experiments. Further mutational analysis confirms that the IR-1 sequence of the BACS and BAT genes mediate transactivation by FXR/RXR heterodimers. Finally, Fisher rats treated with the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 clearly show increased transcript levels of both the BACS and BAT mRNA. These studies demonstrate a mechanism by which FXR regulates bile acid amidation, a critical component of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hallmark of the DNA mismatch repair deficiency that is one of the pathways of gastric carcinogenesis. Clinicopathologic characteristics of MSI+ gastric cancers remain unclear. To determine the correlation between MSI status and clinical features, we analyzed 327 consecutive gastric cancers for the occurrence of MSI in the BAT-26 marker. Because it has been proven that MSI at BAT-26 reflects the MSI+ phenotype, cancers with alteration at BAT-26 were categorized as having the MSI+ phenotype. The expressions of hMLH1, hMSH2, p53, MUC1, MUC2, and CEA were evaluated immunohistochemically using the tissue array method. The MSI+ phenotype was found in 9.5% (31/327) of gastric cancers examined. MSI+ gastric cancers were significantly associated with older age, antral location, Borrmann's gross Type II, intestinal subtype, lower prevalence of lymph node metastasis, and lower pTNM stage (P &lt;.05). By multivariate logistic regression, MSI+ gastric cancers had a lower prevalence of lymph node metastasis independent of tumor invasion (P &lt;.001). MSI+ gastric cancers displayed frequent frameshift mutations of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor (90.3%), BAX (61.3%), hMSH3 (38.7%), and E2F4 (61.3%) genes and diminished hMLH1 (24/31) or hMSH2 (4/31) expressions. The MSI+ phenotype correlated with patient survival in advanced gastric carcinoma (P =.046). In conclusion, MSI+ phenotype in gastric cancers was found to have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics and to be predictive of a favorable outcome in advanced carcinoma.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is important in the adaptation of body energy expenditure to cold exposure, fasting, and overfeeding and in the pathogenesis of obesity. Thyroid hormones are required for the normal functioning of BAT. The mechanism of their effect on BAT, however, has not yet been elucidated. Since most thyroid hormone effects are mediated via the binding of T3 to nuclear receptors (NT3R) the present studies were performed to investigate whether BAT contained NT3R and whether these NT3R were affected by cold exposure, fasting, overfeeding, or hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Rat BAT was found to contain NT3R with a maximum binding capacity (MBC) of 0.28 ng T3/mg DNA and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.2 X 10(-10) M. These parameters were unaffected by any of the experimental conditions studied. A major alteration of BAT NT3R MBC or Kd is thus not a causal factor in the changes in BAT thermogenesis induced by the above experimental conditions. In contrast, 3-wk overfeeding increased (+48%) and fasting decreased (-29%) the MBC of hepatic NT3R. Overfeeding increased serum T3 (+110%), while fasting decreased it (-37%).
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential therapeutic target to reverse obesity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether primary precursor cells isolated from human adult subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) can be induced to differentiate in-vitro into adipocytes that express key markers of brown or beige adipose, and whether the expression level of such markers differs between lean and obese young adult males.
Adipogenic precursor cells were isolated from lean and obese individuals from subcutaneous abdominal WAT biopsies. Cells were grown to confluence, differentiated for 2.5 weeks then harvested for measurement of gene expression and UCP1 protein.
There was no difference between groups with respect to differentiation into adipocytes, as indicated by oil red-O staining, rates of lipolysis, and expression of adipogenic genes (FABP4, PPARG). WAT genes (HOXC9, RB1) were expressed equally in the two groups. Post differentiation, the beige adipose specific genes CITED1 and CD137 were significantly increased in both groups, but classic BAT markers ZIC1 and LHX8 decreased significantly. Cell lines from both groups also equally increased post-differentiation expression of the thermogenic-responsive gene PPARGC1A (PGC-1α). UCP1 gene expression was undetectable prior to differentiation, however after differentiation both gene expression and protein content were increased in both groups and were significantly greater in cultures from lean compared with obese individuals (p&lt;0.05).
Human subcutaneous WAT cells can be induced to attain BAT characteristics, but this capacity is reduced in WAT cells from obese individuals.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) produces heat using chemical energy of lipids and glucose, a function induced by cold exposure or diet. The brown adipogenesis is tightly controlled in a coordinated interplay between several transcriptional factors. It is not known what enables and coordinates this robust program of concerted cooperation between the transcriptional factors and co-regulators necessary for the brown adipogenesis.
A. In vivo studies--we investigated the expression levels of miR-27a and b in mice after cold exposure. B. Using gene expression and functional studies together with high throughput imaging in primary preadipocytes, and cell culture models, we investigated the role of miR-27 in beige and brown adipogenesis. C. Using gene silencing and rescue experiments we dissected the molecular mechanisms of the miR-27 action.
After cold exposure, miR-27 is downregulated in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT). MiR-27 is also downregulated during brown adipogenesis of primary preadipocytes in vitro, and it directly targets and negatively regulates the essential components of the brown transcriptional network: Prdm16, Pparα, Creb, and in part Pgc1β. Together with its direct effect on Pparγ, and indirect on Pgc1α, mir-27 decreases brown differentiation of cultured cells and of primary SAT preadipocytes.
Our results point to miR-27 as a central upstream regulator of the transcriptional network involved in beige and brown adipogenesis after cold exposure, and suggest miR-27 inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach for metabolic diseases aiming at increasing the beige/brown fat mass.
The physiological functions of a tissue in the body are carried out by its complement of expressed genes. Genes that execute a particular function should be more specifically expressed in tissues that perform the function. Given this premise, we mined public microarray expression data to build a database of genes ranked by their specificity of expression in multiple organs. The database permitted the accurate identification of genes and functions known to be specific to individual organs. Next, we used the database to predict transcriptional regulators of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and validated two candidate genes. Based upon hypotheses regarding pathways shared between combinations of BAT or white adipose tissue (WAT) and other organs, we identified genes that met threshold criteria for specific or counterspecific expression in each tissue. By contrasting WAT to the heart and BAT, the two most mitochondria-rich tissues in the body, we discovered a novel function for the transcription factor ESRRG in the induction of BAT genes in white adipocytes. Because the heart and other estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG)-rich tissues do not express BAT markers, we hypothesized that an adipocyte co-regulator acts with ESRRG. By comparing WAT and BAT to the heart, brain, kidney and skeletal muscle, we discovered that an isoform of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) induces BAT markers in C2C12 myocytes in the presence of ESRRG. The results demonstrate a straightforward bioinformatic strategy to associate genes with functions. The database upon which the strategy is based is provided so that investigators can perform their own screens.
All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-dependent autocrine growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation to map 354 RA receptor (RAR) binding loci in MEFs, most of which were similarly occupied by the RAR alpha and RAR gamma receptors. Only a subset of the genes associated with these loci are regulated by RA, among which are several critical components of the TGF-beta pathway. We also show RAR binding to a novel series of target genes involved in cell cycle regulation, transformation, and metastasis, suggesting new pathways by which RA may regulate proliferation and cancer. Few of the RAR binding loci contained consensus direct-repeat (DR)-type elements. The majority comprised either degenerate DRs or no identifiable DRs but anomalously spaced half sites. Furthermore, we identify 462 RAR target loci in embryonic stem (ES) cells and show that their occupancy is cell type specific. Our results also show that differences in the chromatin landscape regulate the accessibility of a subset of more than 700 identified loci to RARs, thus modulating the repertoire of target genes that can be regulated and the biological effects of RA.
The thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) activates thermogenesis by uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria. Although T3 can induce thermogenesis by sympathetic innervation, little is known about its cell autonomous effects on BAT mitochondria. We thus examined effects of T3 on mitochondrial activity, autophagy, and metabolism in primary brown adipocytes and BAT and found that T3 increased fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial respiration as well as autophagic flux, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, there was no significant induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) despite high mitochondrial respiration and UCP1 induction by T3. However, when cells were treated with Atg5 siRNA to block autophagy, induction of mitochondrial respiration by T3 decreased, and was accompanied by ROS accumulation, demonstrating a critical role for autophagic mitochondrial turnover. We next generated an Atg5 conditional knockout mouse model (Atg5 cKO) by injecting Ucp1 promoter-driven Cre-expressing adenovirus into Atg5Flox/Flox mice to examine effects of BAT-specific autophagy on thermogenesis in vivo. Hyperthyroid Atg5 cKO mice exhibited lower body temperature than hyperthyroid or euthyroid control mice. Metabolomic analysis showed that T3 increased short and long chain acylcarnitines in BAT, consistent with increased β-oxidation. T3 also decreased amino acid levels, and in conjunction with SIRT1 activation, decreased MTOR activity to stimulate autophagy. In summary, T3 has direct effects on mitochondrial autophagy, activity, and turnover in BAT that are essential for thermogenesis. Stimulation of BAT activity by thyroid hormone or its analogs may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity and metabolic diseases.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is emerging as an important process in adult muscle stem cells functions: it regulates metabolic reprogramming during activation from a quiescent state, maintains stemness and prevents senescence. We now show that autophagy is specifically required for neonatal myogenesis and muscle development. Specific deletion of Atg7 in PAX7+ (paired box 7) precursors led in mice to a dwarf phenotype, with an effect restricted to the neonatal phase of muscle development. Atg7 knockdown suppressed neonatal satellite cell (nSC) proliferation and differentiation, downregulating the GH-IGF1 functions. When we disrupted autophagy, NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2) accumulated in muscle and nSCs and negatively modulated DDIT3/CHOP (DNA-damage inducible transcript 3) expression. Lower levels of DDIT3 were responsible for reduced GHR expression leading to impaired local production of IGF1. Our results conclusively identify a novel autophagy-dependent pathway that regulates nSC behavior and indicate that autophagy is required for skeletal muscle development in the neonatal phase.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. Recent work has demonstrated that the inducible lncRNA Blnc1 stimulates thermogenic gene expression during brown and beige adipocyte differentiation. However, whether Blnc1 is functionally conserved in humans has not been explored. In addition, the molecular basis of the Blnc1 ribonucleoprotein complex in thermogenic gene induction remains incompletely understood. The aims of the current study were to: i) investigate functional conservation of Blnc1 in mice and humans and ii) elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Blnc1 controls the thermogenic gene program in brown adipocytes.
Full-length human Blnc1 was cloned and examined for its ability to stimulate brown adipocyte differentiation. Different truncation mutants of Blnc1 were generated to identify functional RNA domains responsible for thermogenic gene induction. RNA-protein interaction studies were performed to delineate the molecular features of the Blnc1 ribonucleoprotein complex.
Blnc1 is highly conserved in mice and humans at the sequence and function levels, both capable of stimulating brown adipocyte gene expression. A conserved RNA domain was identified to be required and sufficient for the biological activity of Blnc1. We identified hnRNPU as an RNA-binding protein that facilitates the assembly and augments the transcriptional function of the Blnc1/EBF2 ribonucleoprotein complex.
Blnc1 is a conserved lncRNA that promotes thermogenic gene expression in brown adipocytes through formation of the Blnc1/hnRNPU/EBF2 ribonucleoprotein complex.
Ozone (O3) is a secondary air pollutant of long standing and increasing concern for environmental and human health, and as such, the US Environmental Protection Agency will revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppbv to ≤ 70 ppbv. Long term measurements at the Great Basin National Park (GBNP) indicate that O3 in remote areas of Nevada will exceed a revised standard. As part of the Nevada Rural Ozone Initiative, measurements of O3 and other air pollutants were made at 3 remote sites between February 2012 and March 2014, GBNP, Paradise Valley (PAVA), and Echo Peak (ECHO). Exceptionally high concentrations of each air pollutant were defined relative to each site as mixing ratios that exceeded the 90th percentile of all hourly data. Case studies were analyzed for all periods during which mean daily O3 exceeded the 90th percentile concurrently with a maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 that was "exceptionally high" for the site (65 ppbv at PAVA, 70 ppbv at ECHO and GBNP), and of potential regulatory significance. An MDA8 ≥ 65 ppbv occurred only five times at PAVA, whereas this occurred on 49 and 65 days at GBNP and ECHO, respectively. The overall correlation between O3 and other pollutants was poor, consistent with the large distance from significant primary emission sources. Mean CO at these locations exceeded concentrations reported for background sites in 2000. Trajectory residence time calculations and air pollutant concentrations indicate that exceedances at GBNP and ECHO were promoted by air masses originating from multiple sources, including wildfires, transport of pollution from southern California and the marine boundary layer, and transport of Asian pollution plumes. Results indicate that the State of Nevada will exceed a revised O3 standard due to sources that are beyond their control.
Glutamate (Glu) is a taste enhancer that contributes to the characteristic flavour of foods. In fruit of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), the Glu content increases dramatically during the ripening process, becoming the most abundant free amino acid when the fruit become red. There is also a concomitant increase in NADH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity during the ripening transition. This enzyme is located in the mitochondria and catalyses the reversible amination of 2-oxoglutarate to Glu. To investigate the potential effect of GDH on Glu metabolism, the abundance of GDH was altered by artificial microRNA technology. Efficient silencing of all the endogenous SlGDH genes was achieved, leading to a dramatic decrease in total GDH activity. This decrease in GDH activity did not lead to any clear morphological or metabolic phenotype in leaves or green fruit. However, red fruit on the transgenic plants showed markedly reduced levels of Glu and a large increase in aspartate, glucose and fructose content in comparison to wild-type fruit. These results suggest that GDH is involved in the synthesis of Glu in tomato fruit during the ripening processes. This contrasts with the biological role ascribed to GDH in many other tissues and species. Overall, these findings suggest that GDH has a major effect on the control of metabolic composition during tomato fruit ripening, but not at other stages of development. 
A 2-year-old dappled Percheron horse had a wasting condition that did not respond to antibiotic treatments and ultimately resulted in death. Thickening of the wall of the large colon and enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes were observed at postmortem examination, along with the presence of pinpoint whitish foci in the liver. Microscopic examination of affected tissues revealed diffuse chronic granulomatous enterocolitis, granulomatous mesenteric lymphadenitis, and multifocal granulomatous hepatitis. The DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded intestinal and lymph node samples was analyzed using both a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and PCR-restriction endonuclease analysis and demonstrated the presence of Mycobacterium bovis. 
Production of branched α-glucan, glycogen-like polymers is widely spread in the Bacteria domain. The glycogen pathway of synthesis and degradation has been fairly well characterized in the model enterobacterial species Escherichia coli (order Enterobacteriales, class Gammaproteobacteria), in which the cognate genes (branching enzyme glgB, debranching enzyme glgX, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase glgC, glycogen synthase glgA, and glycogen phosphorylase glgP) are clustered in a glgBXCAP operon arrangement. However, the evolutionary origin of this particular arrangement and of its constituent genes is unknown. Here, by using 265 complete gammaproteobacterial genomes we have carried out a comparative analysis of the presence, copy number and arrangement of glg genes in all lineages of the Gammaproteobacteria. These analyses revealed large variations in glg gene presence, copy number and arrangements among different gammaproteobacterial lineages. However, the glgBXCAP arrangement was remarkably conserved in all glg-possessing species of the orders Enterobacteriales and Pasteurellales (the E/P group). Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of glg genes present in the Gammaproteobacteria and in other main bacterial groups indicated that glg genes have undergone a complex evolutionary history in which horizontal gene transfer may have played an important role. These analyses also revealed that the E/P glgBXCAP genes (a) share a common evolutionary origin, (b) were vertically transmitted within the E/P group, and (c) are closely related to glg genes of some phylogenetically distant betaproteobacterial species. The overall data allowed tracing the origin of the E. coli glgBXCAP operon to the last common ancestor of the E/P group, and also to uncover a likely glgBXCAP transfer event from the E/P group to particular lineages of the Betaproteobacteria. 
Grapevine berry, a nonclimacteric fruit, has three developmental stages; the last one is when berry color and sugar increase. Flavors derived from terpenoid and fatty acid metabolism develop at the very end of this ripening stage. The transcriptomic response of pulp and skin of Cabernet Sauvignon berries in the late stages of ripening between 22 and 37 °Brix was assessed using whole-genome micorarrays.
The transcript abundance of approximately 18,000 genes changed with °Brix and tissue type. There were a large number of changes in many gene ontology (GO) categories involving metabolism, signaling and abiotic stress. GO categories reflecting tissue differences were overrepresented in photosynthesis, isoprenoid metabolism and pigment biosynthesis. Detailed analysis of the interaction of the skin and pulp with °Brix revealed that there were statistically significantly higher abundances of transcripts changing with °Brix in the skin that were involved in ethylene signaling, isoprenoid and fatty acid metabolism. Many transcripts were peaking around known optimal fruit stages for flavor production. The transcript abundance of approximately two-thirds of the AP2/ERF superfamily of transcription factors changed during these developmental stages. The transcript abundance of a unique clade of ERF6-type transcription factors had the largest changes in the skin and clustered with genes involved in ethylene, senescence, and fruit flavor production including ACC oxidase, terpene synthases, and lipoxygenases. The transcript abundance of important transcription factors involved in fruit ripening was also higher in the skin.
A detailed analysis of the transcriptome dynamics during late stages of ripening of grapevine berries revealed that these berries went through massive transcriptional changes in gene ontology categories involving chemical signaling and metabolism in both the pulp and skin, particularly in the skin. Changes in the transcript abundance of genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway of this nonclimacteric fruit were statistically significant in the late stages of ripening when the production of transcripts for important flavor and aroma compounds were at their highest. Ethylene transcription factors known to play a role in leaf senescence also appear to play a role in fruit senescence. Ethylene may play a bigger role than previously thought in this non-climacteric fruit.
Enactment of hospital nurse staffing regulations was brought about by changes in the U.S. health care system that resulted in large-scale reductions in nurse staffing. These reductions came at a time when studies were highlighting inadequacies in care that caused negative patient outcomes and raised questions about the safety of hospitalized patients. Nurse staffing regulations were enacted to ensure that adequate numbers of nurses were available to provide high-quality and safe care. Although these regulations represent progress toward addressing staffing inadequacies, enforcement language is absent or weak and compliance data are either not collected or difficult to access. Explicit and funded enforcement measures need to be included in staffing regulations. Additionally, compliance monitoring and reporting are necessary to evaluate these types of staffing regulations and to determine if they actually achieve the goal of appropriate nurse staffing.
Though useful from a clinical and practical standpoint uniform, large-field chromatic stimuli are likely to contain luminance contributions from retinal inhomogeneities. Such contribution can significantly influence psychophysical thresholds. However, the degree to which small luminance artifacts influence the chromatic VEP has been debated. In particular, claims have been made that band-pass tuning observed in chromatic VEPs result from luminance intrusion. However, there has been no direct evidence presented to support these claims. Recently, large-field isoluminant stimuli have been developed to control for intrusion from retinal inhomogeneities with particular regard to the influence of macular pigment. We report here the application of an improved version of these full-field stimuli to directly test the influence of luminance intrusion on the temporal tuning of the chromatic VEP. Our results show that band-pass tuning persists even when isoluminance is achieved throughout the extent of the stimulus. In addition, small amounts of luminance intrusion affect neither the shape of the temporal tuning function nor the major components of the VEP. These results support the conclusion that the chromatic VEP can depart substantially from threshold psychophysics with regard to temporal tuning and that obtaining a low-pass function is not requisite evidence of selective chromatic activation in the VEP. 
This study investigated the feasibility of using behavioral activation to treat enduring postbereavement mental health difficulties using a two-arm, multiple baseline design comparing an immediate start group to a delayed start group at baseline, 12-, 24-, and 36-weeks postrandomization. Participants received 12-14 sessions of behavioral activation within a 12-week intervention period starting immediately after the first assessment or after 12weeks for the delayed start group. Prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression symptoms were assessed as outcomes. Compared with no treatment, behavioral activation was associated with large reductions in prolonged, complicated, or traumatic grief; posttraumatic stress disorder; and depression symptoms in the intent-to-treat analyses. Seventy percent of the completer sample at posttreatment and 75 percent at follow-up responded to treatment with 45 percent at posttreatment and 40 percent at follow-up being classified as evidencing high-end state functioning at 12-week follow-up. 
Female mate preferences may be under strong selection in zones of contact between closely related species because of greater variation in available mates and the potential costs of hybridization. We studied female mate preferences experimentally in a zone of secondary contact between Desert and Bryant's Woodrat (Neotoma lepida and N. bryanti) in the southern foothills of the Sierra Nevada of California. We tested female preference for conspecific versus heterospecific males in paired choice trials in which females could interact freely with males, but males could not interact directly with each other. We compared preferences of females from both allopatric and sympatric sites.
We did not find evidence of the process of reinforcement as assortative preferences were not stronger in sympatry than in allopatry. Mate preferences, however, were asymmetric, with N. lepida females mating preferentially with conspecifics and N. bryanti females showing no preference by species. Sympatric females were less likely to mate than allopatric females, due in part to an increase in aggressive interactions. However, even in the absence of aggression, courtship led to mating less often in sympatric females, suggesting they were choosier or had lower sexual motivation than allopatric females.
Patterns of mate choice in this woodrat system appear to be strongly impacted by body size and aggressive behavior. In particular, females of the smaller-bodied species rarely interact with the relatively large heterospecific males. In contrast females of the larger-bodied species accept the relatively small heterospecific males. For sympatric animals, rates of aggression were markedly higher than for allopatric animals and reduced affiliative and reproductive behavior in our trials. Sympatric animals are larger and more aggressive, traits that are likely under strong ecological selection across the sharp resource gradient that characterizes the contact zone. However, our results suggest that these traits that are likely favored in competitive interactions between the species also impact reproductive interactions. Combined with our previous findings of post-zygotic isolation in this system, this study suggests that multiple isolating mechanisms contribute to the rate of genetic exchange between these species when they come into contact, and that these mechanisms are the result of selection on traits that are important in a range of ecological and reproductive interactions.
One-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library screening has been broadly utilized for the last two decades to identify small molecules, peptides or peptidomimetics targeting variable screening probes such as cell surface receptors, bacteria, protein kinases, phosphatases, proteases etc. In previous screening methods, library beads were suspended in solution and screened against one single probe. Only the positive beads were tracked and isolated for additional screens and finally selected for chemical decoding. During this process, the remaining negative beads were not tracked and discarded. Here we report a novel bead immobilization method such that a bead library array can be conveniently prepared and screened in its entirety, sequentially many times with a series of distinct probes. This method not only allows us to increase the screening efficiency but also permits us to determine the binding profile of each and every library bead against a large number of target receptors. As proof of concept, we serially screened a random OBOC disulfide containing cyclic heptapeptide library with three water soluble dyes as model probes: malachite green, bromocresol purple and indigo carmine. This multiplicative screening approach resulted in a rapid determination of the binding profile of each and every bead respective to each of the three dyes. Beads that interacted with malachite green only, bromocresol purple only, or both indigo carmine and bromocresol purple were isolated, and their peptide sequences were determined with microsequencer. Ultimately, the novel OBOC multiplicative screening approach could play a key role in the enhancement of existing on-bead assays such as whole cell binding, bacteria binding, protein binding, posttranslational modifications etc. with increased efficiency, capacity, and specificity.
Sneaky little SOD! A metallopeptide-based mimic of nickel-containing superoxide dismutase was used to probe the mechanism of superoxide reduction by the metalloenzyme. Kinetic studies suggest a proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism; large H/D kinetic isotope effects (KIE) are observed. XAS studies suggest the transferred H-atom is in the form of a Ni(II) -S(H)-Cys moiety.
Impurities play a critical role in magnetic fusion research. In large quantities, impurities can cool and dilute plasma creating problems for achieving ignition and burn; however in smaller amounts the impurities could provide valuable information about several plasma parameters through the use of spectroscopy. Many impurity ions radiate within the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range. Here, we report on spectra from the silver flat field spectrometer, which was implemented at the Sustained Spheromak Physics experiment (SSPX) to monitor ion impurity emissions. The chamber within the SSPX was made of Cu, which makes M-shell Cu a prominent impurity signature. The Spect3D spectral analysis code was utilized to identify spectral features in the range of 115-315 Å and to more fully understand the plasma conditions. A second set of experiments was carried out on the compact laser-plasma x-ray∕EUV facility "Sparky" at UNR, with Cu flat targets used. The EUV spectra were recorded between 40-300 Å and compared with results from SSPX.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate lauric acid (LA) as a practical ruminal protozoa-suppressing agent and assess effects of protozoal suppression on fermentation patterns and milk production in dairy cows. In a pilot study, 6 lactating Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulae were used in a randomized complete-block design trial. Cows were fed a basal total mixed ration (TMR) containing (DM basis) 15% alfalfa silage, 40% corn silage, 30% rolled high moisture shelled corn, and 14% solvent soybean meal, and assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: 1) control, 2) 160 g/d of LA, or 3) 222 g/d of sodium laurate, which is equimolar to 160 g/d of LA, all given as a single dose into the rumen via cannulae before feeding. Both agents showed high antiprotozoal activity when pulse dosed at these amounts via ruminal cannulae, reducing protozoa by 90% (P&lt;0.01) within 2 d of treatment. Lauric acid reduced ruminal ammonia concentration by 60% (P&lt;0.01) without altering DMI. Both agents reduced ruminal total free AA concentration (P&lt;0.01) and LA did not affect ruminal pH or total VFA concentration. In a large follow-up feeding trial, 52 Holstein cows (8 with ruminal cannulae) were used in a randomized complete-block design trial. Cows were assigned to 1 of 4 diets and fed only that diet throughout the study. The TMR contained (DM basis) 29% alfalfa silage, 36% corn silage, 14% rolled high moisture shelled corn, and 8% solvent soybean meal. The 4 experimental diets were similar, except part of the finely ground dry corn was replaced with LA in stepwise increments from 0 to 0.97% of dietary DM, which provided (as consumed) 0, 83, 164, and 243 g/d of LA. Adding these amounts of LA to the TMR did not affect DMI, ruminal pH, or other ruminal traits, and milk production. However, LA consumed at 164 and 243 g/d in the TMR reduced the protozoal population by only 25% and 30% (P=0.05), respectively, showing that these levels, when added to the TMR, were not sufficient to achieve a concentration within the rumen that promoted the antiprotozoal effect of LA.
The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate in response to surgical removal or chemical insult. The mechanisms regulating regenerative processes are complex, and incompletely understood. A large number genes, which are not normally expressed in the quiescent liver, are activated. Immediately after partial hepatectomy (PH) (1-6 h), nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells from L-arginine, via induction of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). NO is a highly reactive molecule, known to be involved in diverse biological processes in nearly all aspects of life. Liver regeneration is a major area within the field of NO research. Our review describes several processes that have been suggested to be modulated by the NO released following PH, including proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis in the remnant tissue. Because iNOS up regulation has such profound physiologic effects, its regulation is strictly controlled. The up regulation of iNOS after PH and the subsequent production of NO induce positive effects on the regulation of early stages of the regenerative process. However, overproduction (&gt; 100%) can have detrimental effects, including apoptosis. Thus, the iNOS induction after PH is necessary, and enough to allow for the normal regenerative process.
In breeding programs, a large number of F₂ individuals are required to perform the selection process properly, but often few such plants are available. In order to obtain more F₂ seeds, it is necessary to multiply the F₁ plants. We developed a rapid, efficient and reproducible protocol for in vitro shoot regeneration and rooting of seeds using 6-benzylaminopurine. To optimize shoot regeneration, basic medium contained Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts with or without B5 Gamborg vitamins and different concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (25, 50 and 75 μM) using five genotypes. We found that modified MS (B5 vitamins + 25 μM 6-benzylaminopurine) is suitable for in vitro shoot regeneration of pea. Thirty-eight hybrid combinations were transferred onto selected medium to produce shoots that were used for root induction on MS medium supplemented with α-naphthalene-acetic acid. Elongated shoots were developed from all hybrid genotypes. This procedure can be used in pea breeding programs and will allow working with a large number of plants even when the F₁ plants produce few seeds.
Nitrile hydratases (NHases) are Fe(III)- and Co(III)-containing hydrolytic enzymes that convert nitriles into amides. The metal-center is contained within an N(2)S(3) coordination motif with two post-translationally modified cysteinates contained in a cis arrangement, which have been converted into a sulfinate (R-SO(2)(-)) and a sulfenate (R-SO(-)) group. Herein, we utilize Ru L-edge and ligand (N-, S-, and P-) K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopies to probe the influence that these modifications have on the electronic structure of a series of sequentially oxidized thiolate-coordinated Ru(II) complexes ((bmmp-TASN)RuPPh(3), (bmmp-O(2)-TASN)RuPPh(3), and (bmmp-O(3)-TASN)RuPPh(3)). Included is the use of N K-edge spectroscopy, which was used for the first time to extract N-metal covalency parameters. We find that upon oxygenation of the bis-thiolate compound (bmmp-TASN)RuPPh(3) to the sulfenato species (bmmp-O(2)-TASN)RuPPh(3) and then to the mixed sulfenato/sulfinato speices (bmmp-O(3)-TASN)RuPPh(3) the complexes become progressively more ionic, and hence the Ru(II) center becomes a harder Lewis acid. These findings are reinforced by hybrid DFT calculations (B(38HF)P86) using a large quadruple-ζ basis set. The biological implications of these findings in relation to the NHase catalytic cycle are discussed in terms of the creation of a harder Lewis acid, which aids in nitrile hydrolysis.
We performed structural and immunohistochemical studies on the thymus of juvenile turbot (Psetta maxima L.) in order to define its cellular composition. The thymic stroma was mainly composed of two subpopulations of reticulo-epithelial cells (RECs). RECs immunoreactive to anti-actin antibody were distributed through the organ, while RECs that were cytokeratin-immunopositive were located in the outer zone of the thymus. The parenchyma of the thymus was composed of several cell types such as lymphocytes/thymocytes, lymphoblasts, melano-macrophages and to a lesser extent of nurse-like cells, immunoglobulin positive (Ig+) cells, mucous cells, rodlet cells and neuroendocrine cells. CD3ε+ lymphocytes were mainly located in the outer zone. On the other hand, Ig+ cells were observed in the transitional region between the inner and outer zones of the thymus. The neuroendocrine cells were large and exhibited immunoreactivity to neuropeptide Y and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. They were located in the inner zone of the thymus in close association with lymphoblasts and lymphocytes/thymocytes. This work provides useful information on the structure and cellular composition of the thymus of turbot, identifying several immunomarkers that allow the identification of different cell types, providing the basis for further studies on the immune response of turbot against diseases.
Upstream of N-ras (UNR) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation and stability by binding to sites generally located in untranslated regions (UTRs). In Drosophila, sex-specific binding of UNR to msl2 mRNA and the noncoding RNA roX is believed to play key roles in the control of X-chromosome dosage compensation in both sexes. To investigate broader sex-specific functions of UNR, we have identified its RNA targets in adult male and female flies by high-throughput RNA binding and transcriptome analysis. Here we show that UNR binds to a large set of protein-coding transcripts and to a smaller set of noncoding RNAs in a sex-specific fashion. The analyses also reveal a strong correlation between sex-specific binding of UNR and sex-specific differential expression of UTRs in target genes. Validation experiments indicate that UNR indeed recognizes sex-specifically processed transcripts. These results suggest that UNR exploits the transcript diversity generated by alternative processing and alternative promoter usage to bind and regulate target genes in a sex-specific manner.
We present a Molecular Dynamics (MD) study based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for H(2) interacting with a Pd-Cu(111) surface alloy for low Pd coverages, Θ(Pd). Our results show, in line with recent experimental data, that single isolated Pd atoms evaporated on Cu(111) significantly increase the reactivity of the otherwise inert pure Cu surface. On top of substitutional Pd atoms in the Pd-Cu(111) surface alloy, the activation energy barrier for H(2) dissociation is smaller than the lowest one found on Cu(111) by a factor of two: 0.25 eV vs. 0.46 eV. Also in agreement with experiments, our DFT-MD calculations show that a large fraction of the dissociating H atoms efficiently spillover from Pd (i.e. the active sites), thanks to their extra kinetic energy due to the ~0.50 eV chemisorption exothermicity. Still, our DFT-MD calculations predict a dissociative sticking probability for low energy H(2) molecules that is much smaller than the estimated value from scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. Thus, further theoretical and experimental investigations are required for a complete understanding of H(2) dissociation on low-Θ(Pd) Pd-Cu(111) surface alloys.
An external pinkish growing mass that emerged from the right nostril of an adult goldfish Carassius auratus L. was evaluated by means of light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The neoplasm presented a well-developed fibrovascular stroma associated with solid cell nests and a large number of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes. Myelinated fibres were observed around them. Neoplastic cells showed a prominent degree of nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity. The latter was in agreement with the low reactivity of tumour cells to anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibody. Immunohistochemistry also revealed anti-neuronal nitric oxide synthase, anti-S100 protein, antineuropeptide Y, and anti-cytokeratin immunoreactivity in tumour cells as well as in normal olfactory epithelium of goldfish control sections. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of an olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB). To our knowledge this is the first description of ONB in goldfish.
In the present paper the formation of complexes between positively charge polyelectrolyte (polyethyleneimine and chitosan) and Candida rugosa lipase from a crude extract and porcine lipase from pancreas commercial homogenate preparations were analyzed. The solubility of lipases-cationic polyelectrolytes formation was dependent on: polyelectrolyte densities electrical charge, polyelectrolyte and enzyme concentrations and salts present in the solution. The lipase was recovered from the non-soluble complex by adding of NaCl at a given pH. Although the polyelectrolytes did not affect lipase biological activity, both of them produced good enzyme recovery (&gt;90%); however, purification factors were low. This methodology appears to be a good previous prepurification and concentration method, using, low-cost polymers, allows the design of a purification method where the protein of interest is present in a large volume with respect to the small amount of polyelectrolyte added.
Abiotic stresses, such as water deficit and soil salinity, result in changes in physiology, nutrient use, and vegetative growth in vines, and ultimately, yield and flavor in berries of wine grape, Vitis vinifera L. Large-scale expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated, curated, and analyzed to identify major genetic determinants responsible for stress-adaptive responses. Although roots serve as the first site of perception and/or injury for many types of abiotic stress, EST sequencing in root tissues of wine grape exposed to abiotic stresses has been extremely limited to date. To overcome this limitation, large-scale EST sequencing was conducted from root tissues exposed to multiple abiotic stresses.
A total of 62,236 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from leaf, berry, and root tissues from vines subjected to abiotic stresses and compared with 32,286 ESTs sequenced from 20 public cDNA libraries. Curation to correct annotation errors, clustering and assembly of the berry and leaf ESTs with currently available V. vinifera full-length transcripts and ESTs yielded a total of 13,278 unique sequences, with 2302 singletons and 10,976 mapped to V. vinifera gene models. Of these, 739 transcripts were found to have significant differential expression in stressed leaves and berries including 250 genes not described previously as being abiotic stress responsive. In a second analysis of 16,452 ESTs from a normalized root cDNA library derived from roots exposed to multiple, short-term, abiotic stresses, 135 genes with root-enriched expression patterns were identified on the basis of their relative EST abundance in roots relative to other tissues.
The large-scale analysis of relative EST frequency counts among a diverse collection of 23 different cDNA libraries from leaf, berry, and root tissues of wine grape exposed to a variety of abiotic stress conditions revealed distinct, tissue-specific expression patterns, previously unrecognized stress-induced genes, and many novel genes with root-enriched mRNA expression for improving our understanding of root biology and manipulation of rootstock traits in wine grape. mRNA abundance estimates based on EST library-enriched expression patterns showed only modest correlations between microarray and quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods highlighting the need for deep-sequencing expression profiling methods.
An inexpensive modular perfused chamber (MPC) designed for low- and normal-temperature live-cell imaging is presented. The device consists of four lathed pieces of stainless steel assembled as a cylindrical open chamber that can hold either round or square glass coverslips. The chamber is connected to a thermal-bath operating with recirculation. For image acquisition at 4°C, cooled air is blown toward the coverslip surface to prevent condensation. Principal advantages of this device are thermal stability in the sample environment, rapid response to changes in temperature set point, and easy sample insertion. The device enables the study of dynamic processes in cells governed by large temperature differences such as those imposed by hypothermic preservation of cells (0-4°C) followed by rewarming to normothermia (37°C). The capabilities of the MPC were demonstrated by monitoring the internalization of fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) in rat hepatocytes after hypothermic storage and during rewarming with an inverted microscope.
Environmental conditions may create increased demands for memory, which in turn may affect specific brain regions responsible for memory function. This may occur either via phenotypic plasticity or selection for individuals with enhanced cognitive abilities. For food-caching animals, in particular, spatial memory appears to be important because it may have a direct effect on fitness via their ability to accurately retrieve food caches. Our previous studies have shown that caching animals living in more harsh environments (characterized by low temperatures, high snow cover and short day lengths) possess more neurons within a larger hippocampus (Hp), a part of the brain involved in spatial memory. However, the relative role of each of these environmental features in the relationship is unknown. Here, we dissociate the effects of one theoretically important factor (day length) within the environmental severity/Hp relationship by examining food-caching birds (black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus) selected at locations along the same latitude, but with very different climatic regimes. There was a significant difference in Hp attributes among populations along the same latitude with very different climatic features. Birds from the climatically mild location had significantly smaller Hp volumes and fewer Hp neurons than birds from the more harsh populations, even though all populations experienced similar day lengths. These results suggest that variables such as temperature and snow cover seem to be important even without the compounding effect of reduced day length at higher latitudes and suggest that low temperature and snow cover alone may be sufficient to generate high demands for memory and the hippocampus. Our data further confirmed that the association between harsh environment and the hippocampus in food-caching animals is robust across a large geographical area and across years.
The Karner blue butterfly (KBB), Lycaeides melissa samuelis, is a federally protected taxon whose relationship to the Melissa blue, Lycaeides melissa, has been a point of contention during the 66 years since the KBB was first described. Using a large population-genomic dataset and a model of population divergence with migration, we investigated the relationship between the KBB and L. melissa, as well as the relationship between L. melissa and a third taxon, Lycaeides idas. We report that gene flow between the KBB and L. melissa is low, and comparable to gene flow between L. melissa and L. idas. Considering this population-genetic evidence, we conclude that the KBB is a unique evolutionary lineage that should be recognized as Lycaeides samuelis.
Endosulfan can induce convulsions that could lead to brain damage. The variability and lack of specificity of neurological signs and symptoms in the pre-convulsive stages makes early diagnosis difficult. We sought to determine if electrophysiological exploration of the cerebral cortex could yield objective signs of endosulfan intoxication at levels that do not elicit convulsions. Endosulfan was administered intravenously to Sprague-Dawley adult rats under urethane anesthesia at doses from 0.5 to 4mg/kg. EEG power and the evoked potentials (EP) to forepaw electrical stimulation were studied over the contralateral (S1CL) and homolateral (S1HL) cortical somatosensory areas and the contralateral visual area (V1CL). At each area, five EP waves were measured. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were also recorded. Endosulfan induced a dose-related increase in EPs at all sites. At S1CL, EP peak amplitude was greater than baseline at 1, 2 and 4mg/kg for the first negative, second positive and third negative waves, and at 2 and 4mg/kg for the first and third positive waves. Similar but less marked trends were observed at S1HL and V1CL. A shift of EEG power to higher frequencies (alpha and beta EEG bands) was only present at 4mg/kg. In conclusion, endosulfan induced a large increase of cortical evoked potentials amplitudes at doses that did not elicit convulsions. These responses could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool to detect low-level endosulfan intoxication in humans and to help establish the NOAEL and LOAEL levels of this pollutant.
Gemins 2-8 and Unr-interacting protein (UNRIP) are intimate partners of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is the determining factor for the neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The most documented role of SMN, Gemins and UNRIP occurs within the large macromolecular SMN complex and involves the cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs), a housekeeping process critical in all cells. Several reports detailing alternative functions for SMN in either motor neurons or skeletal muscles may, however, hold the answer to the extreme neuromuscular tissue specificity observed in SMA. Recent discoveries indicate that collaboration between SMN and Gemins also extends to these non-canonical functions, hence raising the possibility that mutations in Gemin genes may be the cause of unlinked neuromuscular hereditary syndromes. This review evaluates the functions of Gemins and UNRIP inside the SMN complex and discusses whether these less notorious SMN complex members are capable of acting independently of SMN.
We have developed a force field to describe the interaction of alkanethiols HS(CH(2))(n-1) CH(3) (C(n) for short) by fitting a set of approximately 220 interaction energies for dimers of C(n) (with n = 1,2,...6) and CH(4) molecules obtained from second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory calculations. The derived force field, based on a sum of so-called exp-6 pairwise potentials and effective Coulomb interaction potential between the HS- heads, predicts very well the interaction energies for dimers and trimers of alkanethiols not included in the input database for the fit. Also the calculated minimum energy tilt angle of the alkyl chains for a hexagonal arrangement of alkanethiolates with a nearest neighbor distance of 5 A is in good agreement with the available experimental data for a sqrt [3] x sqrt [3] self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on Au(111). Thus, the derived force field might be suitable for large-scale molecular dynamics and/or Monte Carlo simulations to predict the structure, stability and/or kinetics of SAMs on other surfaces.
Some plants that are dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals appear to have evolved the ability to manipulate the behaviour of those animals to increase the likelihood that seeds and nuts will be stored and that a portion of those items will not be recovered. Plants have achieved this in at least four ways. First, by producing large, nutritious seeds and nuts that are attractive to animals and that stimulate hoarding behaviour. Second, by imposing handling costs that cause animals to hoard rather than to eat items immediately. These handling costs can take one of two forms: physical barriers (e.g. hard seed coats) that take time to remove and secondary chemicals (e.g. tannins) that impose metabolic costs. Third, by masting, where a population of plants synchronizes reproductive effort, producing large nut crops at intervals of several years. Mast crops not only satiate seed predators, but also increase the amount of seed dispersal because scatter-hoarding animals are not easily satiated during caching (causing animals to store more food than they can consume) but are satiated during cache recovery. And fourth, by producing seeds that do not emit strong odours so that buried seeds are less likely to be discovered. These, and perhaps other, traits have increased the relative success of plant species with seeds dispersed by scatter-hoarding animals.
Vitellogenin (Vtg), a large lipoglycophosphoprotein, is the most important precursor of the yolk proteins, and the major source of nutrients for the developing embryo in oviparous species. After its uptake by the oocytes, Vtg is converted into lipovitellins (high and light) and phosvitin, which are deposited into crystalline yolk platelets. We describe here the presence of two high molecular mass lipovitellin isoforms in Bufo arenarum mature oocytes with masses of 113 and 100 kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequence analysis of p113 and p100 peptides showed a high sequence homology between both polypeptides and the complete reported sequences of Xenopus laevis vitellogenin. Using specific antibodies, we determined that the Vtg uptake begins early during oogenesis, at the previtellogenic stage, and continues until oocytes have reached their mature status. In addition, we found that large endocytic vesicles mediate Vtg uptake in stage I oocytes, and that the size of the endocytic vesicles declines with oogenesis progression. In terms of the Vtg protein trafficking, we detected the Vtg precursor (190 kDa) in the liver of estradiol-injected females. Finally, we propose a subclassification of B. arenarum stage II oocytes into three physiologically and morphologically distinct periods (early, mid and late).
