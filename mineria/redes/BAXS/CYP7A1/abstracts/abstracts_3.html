<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>To obtain efficient non-viral vectors, a series of Gemini cationic lipids with carbamate linkers between headgroups and hydrophobic tails were synthesized. They have the hydrocarbon chains of 12, 14, 16 and 18 carbon atoms as tails, designated as G12, G14, G16 and G18, respectively. These Gemini cationic lipids were prepared into cationic liposomes for the study of the physicochemical properties and gene delivery. The DNA-bonding ability of these Gemini cationic liposomes was much better than their mono-head counterparts (designated as M12, M14, M16 and M18, respectively). In the same series of liposomes, bonding ability declined with an increase in tail length. They were tested for their gene-transferring capabilities in Hep-2 and A549 cells. They showed higher transfection efficiency than their mono-head counterparts and were comparable or superior in transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity to the commercial liposomes, DOTAP and Lipofectamine 2000. Our results convincingly demonstrate that the gene-transferring capabilities of these cationic lipids depended on hydrocarbon chain length. Gene transfection efficiency was maximal at a chain length of 14, as G14 can silence about 80 % of luciferase in A549 cells. Cell uptake results indicate that Gemini lipid delivery systems could be internalised by cells very efficiently. Thus, the Gemini cationic lipids could be used as synthetic non-viral gene delivery carriers for further study.
Familial hemophagocytic syndrome (FHS) and infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IAHS) usually present with fever, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, signs of hepatic dysfunction, bleeding diathesis, and neurological manifestations. FHS is almost uniformly fatal, and IAHS is associated with high mortality. The only distinguishing characteristics are lack of family history and association with infection in the latter. Despite this, sporadic cases of FHS and culture-negative examples of IAHS (idiopathic HS) can be difficult to distinguish and the distinction may have important implications for treatment and family planning. We evaluated the immunophenotype of the macrophages (M phi s) in frozen tissue sections from three cases of hemophagocytic syndrome using a very large panel of monocyte/M phi-associated monoclonal antibodies and an immunoperoxidase technique. The clinical and laboratory features suggested that two were examples of FHS (one with strong family history) and that the third was IAHS/idiopathic HS. The results supported the clinical impressions by showing that the antigenic phenotypes of the FHS cases were nearly identical and different from that of the case of presumed IAHS/idiopathic HS. Specifically, M phi s from the FHS cases expressed complement receptors, 1, 2, and 3 (CD35, CD21, and CD11b, respectively), the monocyte antigen CD36, and the "activation" antigens CD25 (IL2-R) and CD30 (Ki-1), while those from the IAHS/idiopathic case did not. These studies also demonstrated that the M phi s in these cases exhibited some phenotypic differences from those in control tissues, that is, expression of the pan-M phi antigen CD14, the M phi subset antigen identified by antibody G16/1, complement receptors, certain monocyte antigens, and M phi "activation" antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a wall fragment of gram-positive bacteria, induces an isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) in vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages which produces large quantities of NO and profound vasodilation in rats; this process may be involved in the cause of gram-positive septic shock. This study investigates the effect of LTA from Staphylococcus aureus on NO synthesis and iNOS mRNA induction in a mouse macrophage cell line (J774). LTA caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in NO production and a marked induction of iNOS mRNA. The induction of NO synthesis and iNOS gene expression in response to LTA was significantly inhibited by an anti-mouse CD14 monoclonal antibody. Studies utilizing a mutant cell line (J7.DEF3), which is defective in the expression of a CD14 antigen, showed that the increase in NO and iNOS mRNA caused by LTA is profoundly depressed in J7.DEF3 cells compared to that in parent J774 cells. In contrast, interferon-gamma produced a similar concentration-dependent increase in NO formation in both cell types. Thus, CD14 is involved in the signal transduction events leading to the enhanced expression of iNOS mRNA and activity elicited by LTA in murine macrophages. We propose that agents which block CD14-dependent events may be useful therapeutics in gram-positive shock.
The main aim of the study was, to estimate the impact of perfusion defects including significantly depleted areas of varying size on gated perfusion SPECT (GPS) determined ejection fraction (EF) measurements in comparison to radionuclide ventriculography (RVG). A secondary objective was the evaluation of the GPS-RVG agreement of EF in patients with normal and deteriorated left ventricular function, separately.
Fifty-nine patients having perfusion defects including at least one segment with no visible tracer uptake in rest myocardial GPS related to myocardial infarction (older than 15 days) were studied. Myocardial perfusion was visually analyzed using a 17 segment-model, on a five-point (0-4) grading system in which Grade-4 (0-9% maximal uptake) represents cold defects. The patients with &gt;or=4 adjacent, with 2-3 adjacent and with 1 single cold segments were named as Group1(GR1), Group2(GR2) and Group3(GR3), respectively. Secondly, the patients were re-grouped according to RVG-EF values. (Group A: patients with EF&lt;50%; Group B: patients with EF&gt;or=50%). In each group, the GPS-EFs were compared with RVG performed within one week and also the variations of GPS-RVG EF differences among the groups were statistically analyzed.
In overall (r=0.86) and in each subgroup, EFs obtained by GPS were well correlated with RVG. However, in overall (difference mean EF% [dEF%]=4.6+/-6.7, p&lt;0.001) as well as in subgroup evaluation, GPS significantly (p&lt;0.005) underestimated EF. There was no statistically significant difference in GPS-RVG EF variations between GR1, GR2 and GR3 (p&gt;0.05). The RVG-mean differences and RVG-correlation coefficients calculated for GR1,GR2 and GR3 were dEF%=3.1+/-4.6, r=0.85; dEF%=3.7+/-6.03, r=0.80 and dEF%=6.2+/-8.03, r=0.79, respectively. Mean dEF% was statistically higher in group-B than group-A (mean difference of dEF%=4,2, p&lt;0.05). In group-A, GPS-EF values were better agreed with RVG (dEF%=3.34, r=0.75) than in group-B (dEF%=7.52, r=0.53).
The stability of the calculation algorithm of QGS in EF calculation of patients with large depleted infarct areas could be confirmed. The agreement of GPS determined EF is higher in patients having myocardial integrity loss and left ventricular dysfunction.
Resistance training (RT) has the capacity to increase skeletal muscle mass, which is due in part to transient increases in the rate of muscle protein synthesis during postexercise recovery. The role of ribosome biogenesis in supporting the increased muscle protein synthetic demands is not known. This study examined the effect of both a single acute bout of resistance exercise (RE) and a chronic RT program on the muscle ribosome biogenesis response. Fourteen healthy young men performed a single bout of RE both before and after 8 wk of chronic RT. Muscle cross-sectional area was increased by 6 ± 4.5% in response to 8 wk of RT. Acute RE-induced activation of the ERK and mTOR pathways were similar before and after RT, as assessed by phosphorylation of ERK, MNK1, p70S6K, and S6 ribosomal protein 1 h postexercise. Phosphorylation of TIF-IA was also similarly elevated following both RE sessions. Cyclin D1 protein levels, which appeared to be regulated at the translational rather than transcriptional level, were acutely increased after RE. UBF was the only protein found to be highly phosphorylated at rest after 8 wk of training. Also, muscle levels of the rRNAs, including the precursor 45S and the mature transcripts (28S, 18S, and 5.8S), were increased in response to RT. We propose that ribosome biogenesis is an important yet overlooked event in RE-induced muscle hypertrophy that warrants further investigation.
Alteration of lipid metabolism is an important mechanism for the treatment of insulin resistance. PGC-1α, a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, plays an important role in the improvement of insulin sensitivity by increasing fatty acids β-oxidation. In the present study, the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an anti-obesity agent and enhancer of lipid catabolism, on PGC-1α protein expression was examined and compared with anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone (RGZ). After differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes, insulin resistance was induced by palmitate treatment. Then the expression of the PGC-1a gene and glucose uptake were evaluated before and after treatment with RGZ and EGCG. Palmitate treatment significantly decreased PGC-1α protein expression in C2C12 cells (P &lt; 0.05). RGZ could restore the expression of PGC-1α in palmitate treated cells (P &gt; 0.05), while EGCG had no significant effect on the expression of this gene (P &lt; 0.05). RGZ and EGCG significantly improved glucose uptake (by 2- and 1.54-fold, respectively) in myotubes treated with palmitate. These data suggest that RGZ and EGCG both exert their anti-diabetic activity by increasing insulin sensitivity, but with different molecular mechanisms. This effect of RGZ, unlike EGCG, is mediated, at least partly, by increasing PGC-1α protein expression. 
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells) are known to be a component of the tumor microenvironment. BMSCs are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, epithelial cells and endothelial cells. Stem cells found in niches or transplanted into injured tissues constantly encounter hypoxic stress. Areas with very low to no oxygen pressure exist in solid tumors. The differentiation capacity of BMSCs under hypoxic conditions remains controversial.
In this study, a hypoxic workstation, set at an oxygen concentration of 0.2% was used to mimic the hypoxic microenvironment of cancer in vivo. Oil red O staining and alkaline phosphatase staining were used to examine the adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation, respectively, of BMSCs. Real-time PCR was performed to explore the expression of adipocyte- or osteocyte-specific genes. An RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array was used to screen a panel of 84 genes associated with human adipogenesis in BMSCs under normal and hypoxic conditions. A dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were applied to analyze promoter activity to evaluate the possible regulatory mechanism of adipocyte-specific gene expression.
We found that this extreme hypoxia impaired osteogenic differentiation as indicated by the attenuation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the reduced expression of osteogenic markers osteocalcin and osteopontin. Moreover, extreme hypoxia enhanced adipogenic differentiation, as indicated by the accumulation of lipid droplets and the expression of the adipocyte-specific genes leptin, LPL, CFD, PGAR and HIG2. In the extreme hypoxic conditions (0.2% oxygen), the overexpression of CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), especially C/EBPδ, and HIF-1A upregulated the promoter activities of adipocyte-specific genes such as leptin, CFD, HIG2, LPL, PGAR. In the present study, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) exerted a negative effect on the differentiation of BMSCs into adipocytes.
In view of these findings, extreme hypoxia induced the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs through HIF-1A and C/EBPs. These findings might provide clues regarding the roles of BMSCs in the cancer microenvironment.
Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most common type of RNA editing in mammals, and is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for A-to-I editing in humans, and A-to-I underediting at the glutamine (Q)/arginine (R) site of the glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B) is associated with the pathogenesis and invasiveness of glioma. The level of ADAR2 mRNA expression and the alternative splicing of the ADAR2 pre-mRNA both affect the catalytic activity of ADAR2. However, reports of ADAR2 mRNA expression in glioma are inconsistent. The mechanism regulating ADAR2 pre-mRNA splicing is also unknown. In this study, we explored the deregulation of A-to-I RNA editing in glioma. We confirmed the underediting at the Q/R site of GluR-B mRNA in the glioma cell lines U87, U251 and A172 compared with that in normal human astrocytes (NHAs) HA1800. However, we demonstrated with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) that the expression of ADAR2 mRNA was not significantly altered in the glioma cell lines. Three alternative splicing sites are utilized in the glioma cell lines and NHAs: the first, located between exons -1 and 1, causes the inclusion of exon 1a; the second causes the removal of exon 2, which encodes two double-stranded RNA-binding domains; and the third, located between exons 4 and 6, causes the inclusion of alternative exon 5a, introducing a 120-nucleotide coding Alu-repeat sequence in frame. However, the expression ratio of two types of transcripts (with and without exon 5a) was altered in the glioma cells. Transcripts with exon 5a, which generate an ADAR2 isoform with ~50% reduced activity, were predominantly expressed in the glioma cell lines, whereas transcripts without exon 5a were predominantly expressed in the NHAs. From these results, we conclude that this aberrant alternative splicing pattern of ADAR2 downregulates A-to-I editing in glioma.
Autophagy has been shown to be involved in cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, was demonstrated to induce autophagy in various cancer cells. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the role of autophagy on the paclitaxel-induced cell death in endometrial carcinoma. In this study, we found that paclitaxel induced autophagy in paclitaxel-insensitive HEC-1A and JEC cells, exhibiting an increased microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II/LC3-I ratio, a decrease in p62/SQSTM1 abundance, the upregulation of Beclin 1 expression and punctate dots of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-LC3 in the cytosol. Paclitaxel-mediated cell death was further potentiated by pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or shRNA against the autophagic gene beclin 1. Moreover, paclitaxel stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and inhibition of the ROS by antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) blocked paclitaxel-induced autophagy, indicating that paclitaxel-induced autophagy in endometrial carcinoma cells is mediated by ROS. These ﬁndings suggest that paclitaxel-elicited autophagic response plays a protective role that impedes the eventual death of endometrial carcinoma cell, and that autophagy-inhibitor therapy could be an effective and potent strategy to improve paclitaxel treatment outcomes in the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.
Drosophila Piwi was reported by Huang et al. (2013) to be guided by piRNAs to piRNA-complementary sites in the genome, which then recruits heterochromatin protein 1a and histone methyltransferase Su(Var)3-9 to the sites. Among additional findings, Huang et al. (2013) also reported Piwi binding sites in the genome and the reduction of RNA polymerase II in euchromatin but its increase in pericentric regions in piwi mutants. Marinov et al. (2015) disputed the validity of the Huang et al. bioinformatic pipeline that led to the last two claims. Here we report our independent reanalysis of the data using current bioinformatic methods. Our reanalysis agrees with Marinov et al. (2015) that Piwi's genomic targets still remain to be identified but confirms the Huang et al. claim that Piwi influences RNA polymerase II distribution in the genome. This Matters Arising Response addresses the Marinov et al. (2015) Matters Arising, published concurrently in this issue of Developmental Cell.
Enzymes Akt, AMPK, mTOR, S6K and PGC-1a coactivator take part in skeletal muscles in the regulation of synthesis of proteins. The expression of these proteins is regulated by growth factors, hormones, nutrients, mechanical loading and leads to an increase in muscle mass and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The review presents the results of studies published in the past four years, which expand knowledge on the effects of various factors on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. The attention is focused on the achievements that reveal and clarify the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. The central place is taken by mTOR enzyme which controls and regulates the main stages of the cascade of reactions of muscle proteins providing synthesis in the conditions of human life. coactivator PGC-1a.
The development and progression of melanoma have been attributed to independent or combined genetic and epigenetic events. There has been remarkable progress in understanding melanoma pathogenesis in terms of genetic alterations. However, recent studies have revealed a complex involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression, including methylation, chromatin modification and remodeling, and the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. The roles of gene methylation and miRNAs have been relatively well studied in melanoma, but other studies have shown that changes in chromatin status and in the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs can lead to altered regulation of key genes. Taken together, they affect the functioning of signaling pathways that influence each other, intersect, and form networks in which local perturbations disturb the activity of the whole system. Here, we focus on how epigenetic events intertwine with these pathways and contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma. 
Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a genetic disorder due to target-organ unresponsiveness to parathyroid hormone (PTH). PHP type 1A (PHP1A) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and PTH resistance caused by defects at the GNAS locus. We analyzed the GNAS gene in a male with typical AHO and elevated PTH levels. We identified a novel de novo heterozygous mutation at the splice donor site in intron-7 (IVS7+1G&gt;A, c.585+1G&gt;A) of the GNAS gene. No GNAS mutations were detected in his parents. Our patient was diagnosed with PHP1A due to a heterozygous de novo mutation in the GNAS gene. Reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR analysis and sequencing revealed that this de novo splice mutation generated alternative splicing errors leading to the formation of 2 mutant transcripts: one with exon-7 deleted, the other with whole intron-7 included. To investigate whether these aberrantly spliced transcripts were stable, we assessed the differential expression of GNAS mRNAs in the proband's blood by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. In the proband, the relative expression levels of wild-type, exon-7-deleted, and intron-7-included GNAS mRNAs were 0.21, 6.12E-07, and 1.08E-04, respectively, relative to wild-type GNAS mRNA from a healthy control (set at 1.0). This suggests that this novel de novo splicing mutation generates rapidly decaying mutant transcripts, which might affect stimulatory G-protein activity and give rise to this sporadic case. In conclusion, this is an interesting report of aberrantly spliced mRNAs from a de novo splice mutation of the GNAS gene causing PHP1A in a male. 
BMS-791325 is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) inhibitor binding to the thumb domain of the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 is well characterized in genotype 1 (GT1) and exhibits good inhibitory activity (50% effective concentration [EC50], &lt;10 nM) against hybrid replicons containing patient NS5B sequences from GT3a, -4a, and -5a while potency against GT2 is significantly reduced (J. A. Lemm et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 58:3485-3495, 2014, doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.02495-13). BMS-791325 potency against GT6a hybrid replicons is more variable, with two of three hybrid clones having EC50s similar to that for GT1 while a third patient clone was ∼ 10 times less susceptible to BMS-791325. To characterize the resistance profile of BMS-791325 beyond GT1, curing studies were performed across GT1a and -3a to -6a and demonstrated that GT1a has the highest resistance barrier versus BMS-791325 while GT6a has the lowest. Selection of GT3 to -6 NS5B chimeric replicon cells at different concentrations of BMS-791325 revealed substitutions in the thumb domain of NS5B at residues 494 and 495 that conferred different levels of resistance to BMS-791325 but remained susceptible to NS5A or NS3 protease inhibitors. In addition, we demonstrate that the reduced potency of BMS-791325 against one GT6a patient is due to an A494 polymorphism present in ∼ 21% of sequences in the European HCV database. The results from this report suggest that BMS-791325 is a candidate for combination treatment of HCV GT3 to -6 chronic infections, and the resistance profiles identified will provide useful information for future clinical development.
PGC-1α is an inducible transcriptional coactivator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism in skeletal muscle. Recent studies have identified two additional PGC-1α transcripts that are derived from an alternative exon 1 (exon 1b) and induced by exercise. Given that the PGC-1α gene also produces NT-PGC-1α transcript by alternative 3(') splicing between exon 6 and exon 7, we have investigated isoform-specific expression of NT-PGC-1α mRNA in mouse skeletal muscle during physical exercise with different intensities. We report here that NT-PGC-1α-a mRNA expression derived from a canonical exon 1 (exon 1a) is increased by high-intensity exercise and AMPK activator AICAR in mouse skeletal muscle but not altered by low- and medium-intensity exercise and β 2-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol. In contrast, the alternative exon 1b-driven NT-PGC-1α-b (PGC-1α4) and NT-PGC-1α-c are highly induced by low-, medium-, and high-intensity exercise, AICAR, and clenbuterol. Ectopic expression of NT-PGC-1α-a in C2C12 myotube cells upregulates myosin heavy chain (MHC I, MHC II a) and Glut4, which represent oxidative fibers, and promotes the expression of mitochondrial genes (Cyc1, COX5B, and ATP5B). In line with gene expression data, citrate synthase activity was significantly increased by NT-PGC-1α-a in C2C12 myotube cells. Our results indicate the regulatory role for NT-PGC-1α-a in mitochondrial biogenesis and adaptation of skeletal muscle to endurance exercise. 
Clinical studies indicate that prostaglandins of E class (PGEs) may promote healing of tissue injury e.g., gastroduodenal and dermal ulcers. However, the precise roles of PGEs, their E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, signaling pathways including cAMP and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and their relation to VEGF and angiogenesis in the tissue injury healing process remain unknown, forming the rationale for this study. Using an esophageal ulcer model in rats, we demonstrated that esophageal mucosa expresses predominantly EP2 receptors and that esophageal ulceration triggers an increase in expression of the EP2 receptor, activation of CREB (the downstream target of the cAMP signaling), and enhanced VEGF gene expression. Treatment of rats with misoprostol, a PGE1 analog capable of activating EP receptors, enhanced phosphorylation of CREB, stimulated VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and accelerated esophageal ulcer healing. In cultured human esophageal epithelial (HET-1A) cells, misoprostol increased intracellular cAMP levels (by 163-fold), induced phosphorylation of CREB, and stimulated VEGF expression. A cAMP analog (Sp-cAMP) mimicked, whereas an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (Rp-cAMP) blocked, these effects of misoprostol. These results indicate that the EP2/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway mediates the stimulatory effect of PGEs on angiogenesis essential for tissue injury healing via the induction of CREB activity and VEGF expression. 
Somatic mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1, EIF1AX, and BAP1 have been identified in uveal melanoma (UM). The aim of this study was to determine whether mutations in these genes in primary tumors were associated with metastases in individuals diagnosed with UM.
A total of 63 UM cases who developed a metastasis within 48 months of primary treatment and 53 UM controls who were metastasis-free over a similar time period were selected for the study. Primary UM cases were screened for mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1, EIF1AX, and BAP1. The association of these mutations with tumor characteristics, chromosome 3 copy number, and metastatic status was analyzed by logistic regression to estimate the odds of developing metastasis within 48 months.
As expected, tumor diameter, thickness, cilio-choroidal location, and chromosome 3 monosomy were all significantly (P &lt; 0.02) associated with the presence of metastasis. In univariate analysis, GNA11 (odds ratio [OR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-5.5) and BAP1 (OR 6.3, 95% CI 2.7-14.4) mutations were positively associated and EIF1AX mutation (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.034-0.47) was inversely associated with metastatic status at 48 months after UM treatment. After adjustment for covariates, a chromosome 3 monosomy/BAP1-mutation/EIF1AX-wild-type (WT) mutation profile was strongly associated (OR 37.5, 95% CI 4.3-414) with the presence of metastasis compared with a chromosome 3 disomy/BAP1-WT/EIF1AX mutation profile.
The results suggest that knowledge of mutations in BAP1 and EIF1AX can enhance prognostication of UM beyond that determined by chromosome 3 and tumor characteristics. Tumors with chromosome 3 disomy/BAP1-WT/EIF1AX-WT have a 10-fold increased risk of metastasis at 48 months compared with disomy-3/BAP1-WT/EIF1AX mutant tumors.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of acute aerobic exercise on the expression of PGC-1α transcript variants in human skeletal muscle. Seven endurance-trained athletes performed a 90-min cycling test (62% of VO2max). At resting state, the levels of N-truncated (NT)-PGC-1α and PGC-1α exon 1a-derived transcripts were significantly higher (&gt;20-fold; P&lt;0.05) than those of PGC-1α exon 1b- and 1c-derived transcripts. Acute exercise did not change the PGC-1α exon 1a-derived expression level, but it did increase the expression level of NT-PGC-1α mRNAs 6-fold, and the expression levels of PGC-1α exon 1b- and 1c-derived mRNAs&gt;200-fold (P&lt;0.05). We conclude that NT-PGC-1α transcript expression in resting muscle and after acute moderate-intensity exercise constituted a significant share of total PGC-1α expression. The exercise led to a higher level of PGC-1α expression from alternative promoters (exon 1b- and 1c-derived mRNA) than from the canonical proximal promoter (exon 1a-derived mRNA).
MTOR, a central regulator of autophagy, is involved in cancer and cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Modulating the MTOR signaling balance could be of great significance for numerous diseases. No chemical activators of MTOR have been found, and the urgent challenge is to find novel MTOR downstream components. In previous studies, we found a chemical small molecule, 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO), that inhibited autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and neuronal cells. Here, we found that 3BDO activated MTOR by targeting FKBP1A (FK506-binding protein 1A, 12 kDa). We next used 3BDO to detect novel factors downstream of the MTOR signaling pathway. Activation of MTOR by 3BDO increased the phosphorylation of TIA1 (TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein/T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1). Finally, we used gene microarray, RNA interference, RNA-ChIP assay, bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assay, and other assays and found that 3BDO greatly decreased the level of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) derived from the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of TGFB2, known as FLJ11812. TIA1 was responsible for processing FLJ11812. Further experiments results showed that FLJ11812 could bind with MIR4459 targeting ATG13 (autophagy-related 13), and ATG13 protein level was decreased along with 3BDO-decreased FLJ11812 level. Here, we provide a new activator of MTOR, and our findings highlight the role of the lncRNA in autophagy. 
Pangasianodon hypophthalmus is one of the fast-growing catfish of freshwater origin, and its growth is attributed by the action of growth hormone (GH). In this study, the growth hormone gene (PhGH) of 3.0 kb was characterized, and it is composed of five exons and four introns and having characteristics of an upstream region that contains TATA, CAAT boxes, and binding sites of important transcription factors like Pit-1a, CRE, CREB, CREBP, Ap-1, SP1, and TBP. The full-length cDNA sequence of 1,069 bp was isolated using RACE technique, and it is composed of untranslated regions of 60 and 403 bp at 5' and 3', respectively, with an open reading frame of 603 bp that encodes a putative polypeptide of 200 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 22.57 kDa. The precursor of PhGH is composed of 22 amino acid signal peptides and 178 amino acid mature peptides. Five conserved Cys residues (Cys(71), Cys(135), Cys(173), Cys(190), and Cys(198)) and two possible sites of N-glycosylation (145th and 197th) were detected on GH polypeptide. The PhGH gene showed more than 90 % sequence similarity with other catfishes, and the phylogeny constructed revealed the close proximity of Siluriformes fishes with Cypriniformes fishes. The PhGH gene was observed to be expressed predominantly in pituitary tissues while weekly expressed in extrapituitary tissues. Further, the recombinant PhGH was expressed in Escherichia coli using His-tag expression vector pET 32(a), and the recombinant protein of ~23 kDa was confirmed by western blotting. Our findings suggest that the identified functional GH gene would provide basic information in transgenic studies aiming for faster growth rate. This recombinant growth hormone (GH) may be produced in large scale to exploit its growth-promoting function in other cultured fishes. 
BMS-791325 is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to thumb site 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. BMS-791325 inhibits recombinant NS5B proteins from HCV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) below 28 nM. In cell culture, BMS-791325 inhibited replication of HCV subgenomic replicons representing genotypes 1a and 1b at 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 3 nM and 6 nM, respectively, with similar (3 to 18 nM) values for genotypes 3a, 4a, and 5a. Potency against genotype 6a showed more variability (9 to 125 nM), and activity was weaker against genotype 2 (EC50, 87 to 925 nM). Specificity was demonstrated by the absence of activity (EC50s of &gt;4 μM) against a panel of mammalian viruses, and cytotoxic concentrations (50%) were &gt;3,000-fold above the HCV EC50. Resistance substitutions selected by BMS-791325 in genotype 1 replicons mostly mapped to a single site, NS5B amino acid 495 (P495A/S/L/T). Additive or synergistic activity was observed in combination studies using BMS-791325 with alfa interferon plus ribavirin, inhibitors of NS3 protease or NS5A, and other classes of NS5B inhibitor (palm site 2-binding or nucleoside analogs). Plasma and liver exposures in vivo in several animal species indicated that BMS-791325 has a hepatotropic disposition (liver-to-plasma ratios ranging from 1.6- to 60-fold across species). Twenty-four hours postdose, liver exposures across all species tested were ≥ 10-fold above the inhibitor EC50s observed with HCV genotype 1 replicons. These findings support the evaluation of BMS-791325 in combination regimens for the treatment of HCV. Phase 3 studies are ongoing.
Clinical studies suggest that the oral acyclic retinoid Peretinoin may reduce the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following surgical ablation of primary tumours. Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of HCC, we assessed whether Peretinoin and other retinoids have any effect on HCV infection. For this purpose, we measured the effects of several retinoids on the replication of genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a HCV in vitro. Peretinoin inhibited RNA replication for all genotypes and showed the strongest antiviral effect among the retinoids tested. Furthermore, it reduced infectious virus release by 80-90% without affecting virus assembly. These effects could be due to reduced signalling from lipid droplets, triglyceride abundance, and the expression of mature sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and fatty acid synthase. These negative effects of Peretinoin on HCV infection may be beneficial in addition to its potential for HCC chemoprevention in HCV-infected patients. 
The actin-binding protein Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1) can modulate voltage-gated calcium channels in vitro. KLHL1 interacts with actin and with the pore-forming subunits of Cav2.1 and CaV3.2 calcium channels, resulting in up-regulation of P/Q and T-type current density. Here we tested whether endogenous KLHL1 modulates voltage gated calcium currents in cultured hippocampal neurons by down-regulating the expression of KLHL1 via adenoviral delivery of shRNA targeted against KLHL1 (shKLHL1). Control adenoviruses did not affect any of the neuronal properties measured, yet down-regulation of KLHL1 resulted in HVA current densities ~68% smaller and LVA current densities 44% smaller than uninfected controls, with a concomitant reduction in α(1A) and α(1H) protein levels. Biophysical analysis and western blot experiments suggest Ca(V)3.1 and 3.3 currents are also present in shKLHL1-infected neurons. Synapsin I levels, miniature postsynaptic current frequency, and excitatory and inhibitory synapse number were reduced in KLHL1 knockdown. This study corroborates the physiological role of KLHL1 as a calcium channel modulator and demonstrates a novel, presynaptic role.
New direct acting antivirals (DAAs) such as daclatasvir (DCV; BMS-790052), which target NS5A function with picomolar potency, are showing promise in clinical trials. The exact nature of how these compounds have an inhibitory effect on HCV is unknown; however, major resistance mutations appear in the N-terminal region of NS5A that include the amphipathic helix and domain 1. The dimeric symmetry of these compounds suggests that they act on a dimer of NS5A, which is also consistent with the presence of dimers in crystals of NS5A domain 1 from genotype 1b. Genotype 1a HCV is less potently affected by these compounds and resistance mutations have a greater effect than in the 1b genotypes. We have obtained crystals of domain 1 of the important 1a NS5A homologue and intriguingly, our X-ray crystal structure reveals two new dimeric forms of this domain. Furthermore, the high solvent content (75%) makes it ideal for ligand-soaking. Daclatasvir (DCV) shows twofold symmetry suggesting NS5A dimers may be of physiological importance and serve as potential binding sites for DCV. These dimers also allow for new conformations of a NS5A expansive network which could explain its operation on the membranous web. Additionally, sulfates bound in the crystal structure may provide evidence for the previously proposed RNA binding groove, or explain regulation of NS5A domain 2 and 3 function and phosphorylation, by domain 1. 
Although acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21) belongs to the favorable risk AML subset, relapse incidence may reach 30% in those patients. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcript is a well-established marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and performances of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 DNA as MRD marker in AML with t(8;21). In 17/22 patients with t(8;21)-positive AML treated in the French CBF-2006 trial, breakpoints in RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 were identified using long-range PCR followed by next-generation sequencing. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 DNA quantification was performed by real-time quantitative PCR using patient-specific primers and probe. MRD levels were evaluated in 71 follow-up samples from 16 patients, with a median of four samples [range 2-7] per patient. RUNX1 breakpoints were located in intron 5 in all cases. RUNX1T1 breakpoints were located in intron 1b in 15 cases and in intron 1a in two cases. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 MRD levels measured on DNA and RNA were strongly correlated (r = 0.8, P &lt; 0.0001). Discordant MRD results were observed in 10/71 (14%) of the samples: in three samples from two patients who relapsed, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 was detectable only on DNA, while RUNX1-RUNX1T1 was detectable only on RNA in seven samples. MRD monitoring on genomic DNA is feasible, but with sensitivity variations depending on the patient breakpoint sequence and the qPCR assay efficiency. Although interpretation of the results is easier because it is closely related to the number of leukemic cells, this method greatly increases time, cost and complexity, which limits its interest in routine practice.
Agonist-activated μ-opioid receptor (OPRM1) undergoes robust receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and subsequent β-arrestin recruitment, triggering receptor internalization and desensitization. Morphine, a widely prescribed opioid, induces receptor phosphorylation inefficiently. Previously we reported that FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) specifically interacts with OPRM1 and such interaction attenuates receptor phosphorylation and facilitates morphine-induced recruitment and activation of protein kinase C. In the current study, we demonstrated that the association of FKBP12 with OPRM1 also affects morphine-induced receptor internalization and G protein-dependent adenylyl cyclase desensitization. Morphine induced faster receptor internalization and adenylyl cyclase desensitization in cells expressing OPRM1 with Pro(353) mutated to Ala (OPRM1P353A), which does not interact with FKBP12, or in the presence of FK506 which dissociates the receptor-FKBP12 interaction. Furthermore, knockdown of cellular FKBP12 level by siRNA accelerated morphine-induced receptor internalization and adenylyl cyclase desensitization. Our study further demonstrated that peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of FKBP12 probably plays a role in inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. In the view that internalized receptor recycles and thus counteracts the development of analgesic tolerance, receptor's association with FKBP12 could also contribute to the development of morphine tolerance through modulation of receptor trafficking. 
Mammalian hibernators survive low body temperatures, ischemia-reperfusion, and restricted nutritional resources via global reductions in energy-expensive cellular processes and selective increases in stress pathways. Consequently, studies that analyze hibernation uncover mechanisms which balance metabolism and support survival by enhancing stress tolerance. We hypothesized processing factors that influence messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) maturation and translation may play significant roles in hibernation. We characterized the amino acid sequences of three RNA processing proteins (T cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA1-related (TIAR), and poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP-1)) from thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), which all displayed a high degree of sequence identity with other mammals. Alternate Tia-1 and TiaR gene variants were found in the liver with higher expression of isoform b versus a in both cases. The localization of RNA-binding proteins to subnuclear structures was assessed by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by subcellular fractionation; TIA-1 was identified as a major component of subnuclear structures with up to a sevenfold increase in relative protein levels in the nucleus during hibernation. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the relative protein levels of TIARa/TIARb in the nucleus, and a decrease was observed for TIAR isoforms in cytoplasmic fractions of torpid animals. Finally, we used solubility tests to analyze the formation of reversible aggregates that are associated with TIA-1/R function during stress; a shift towards the soluble fraction (TIA-1a, TIA-1b) was observed during hibernation suggesting enhanced protein aggregation was not present during torpor. The present study identifies novel posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms that may play a role in reducing translational rates and/or mRNA processing under unfavorable environmental conditions. 
In MS patients under IFNβ treatment to seek alternative treatments timely is important that anti-IFNβ antibodies and/or in vivo biologic activity loss detection in these. The most common diagnostic markers used for this purpose are BAb, Nab, and MxA. In this article, we aimed to establish the availability and feasibility of the correlation between BAb and MxA gene expression (mRNA) levels using evaluation of responses to IFNβ treatment for MS patients with a routine laboratory follow-up strategy in a major Turkish MS center. Bab seropositivity was determined in blood samples of 218 MS patients treated with different IFNβ preparations and MxA mRNA levels were measured in 128 patients among the total population. BAb seropositivity ratios to im INF-β 1a, scINF-β 1a, and sc INF-β 1b were 21.4%, 28.6%, and 70.4%, respectively (total 40%), and total loss of bioactivity (MxA mRNA) were 9.3%, 9.5%, and 11.6%, respectively (total 10.2%). The correlation between high BAb titers and low MxA mRNA levels was highly significant (P = 0.00003). Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between especially high BAbs levels and diminished MxA mRNA levels. 
The tumor suppressor and microtubule-associated protein Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) has a major effect on many cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis. RASSF1A expression is frequently silenced in cancer and is associated with increased metastasis. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that RASSF1A regulates microtubule organization and dynamics in interphase cells, as well as its effect on Golgi integrity and cell polarity. Our results show that RASSF1A uses a unique microtubule-binding pattern to promote site-specific microtubule rescues, and loss of RASSF1A leads to decreased microtubule stability. Furthermore, RASSF1A-associated stable microtubule segments are necessary to prevent Golgi fragmentation and dispersal in cancer cells and maintain a polarized cell front. These results indicate that RASSF1A is a key regulator in the fine tuning of microtubule dynamics in interphase cells and proper Golgi organization and cell polarity. 
The UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A enzymes are involved in the phase II metabolism of many important endogenous and exogenous compounds. The nine UGT1A isoforms exhibit high interindividual differences in expression, but their epigenetic regulation is not well understood. The purpose of the present study was to examine microRNA (miRNA) regulation of hepatic UGT1A enzymes and determine whether or not that regulation impacts enzymatic activity. In silico analysis identified miRNA 491-3p (miR-491-3p) as a potential regulator of the UGT1A gene family via binding to the shared UGT1A 3'-untranslated region common to all UGT1A enzymes. Transfection of miR-491-3p mimic into HuH-7 cells significantly repressed UGT1A1 (P &lt; 0.001), UGT1A3 (P &lt; 0.05), and UGT1A6 (P &lt; 0.05) mRNA levels. For UGT1A1, this repression correlated with significantly reduced metabolism of raloxifene into raloxifene-6-glucuronide (ral-6-gluc; P &lt; 0.01) and raloxifene-4'-glucuronide (ral-4'-gluc; P &lt; 0.01). In HuH-7 cells with repressed miR-491-3p expression, there was a significant increase (~80%; P &lt; 0.01) in UGT1A1 mRNA and a corresponding increase in glucuronidation of raloxifene into ral-6-gluc (50%; P &lt; 0.05) and ral-4'-gluc (22%; P &lt; 0.01). Knockdown of endogenous miR-491-3p in HepG2 cells did not significantly alter UGT1A1 mRNA levels but did increase the formation of ral-6-gluc (50%; P &lt; 0.05) and ral-4'-gluc (34%; P &lt; 0.001). A significant inverse correlation between miR-491-3p expression and both UGT1A3 (P &lt; 0.05) and UGT1A6 (P &lt; 0.01) mRNA levels was observed in a panel of normal human liver specimens, with a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in UGT1A3 and UGT1A6 mRNA levels observed in miR-491-3p nonexpressing versus expressing liver specimens. These results suggest that miR-491-3p is an important factor in regulating the expression of UGT1A enzymes in vivo.
HLTF/Hltf regulates transcription, remodels chromatin, and coordinates DNA damage repair. Hltf is expressed in mouse brain and heart during embryonic and postnatal development. Silencing Hltf is semilethal. Seventy-four percent of congenic C57BL/6J Hltf knockout mice died, 75% within 12-24 hours of birth. Previous studies in neonatal (6-8 hour postpartum) brain revealed silencing Hltf disrupted cell cycle progression, and attenuated DNA damage repair. An RNA-Seq snapshot of neonatal heart transcriptome showed 1,536 of 20,000 total transcripts were altered (p &lt; 0.05) - 10 up- and 1,526 downregulated. Pathway enrichment analysis with MetaCore™ showed Hltf's regulation of the G2/M transition (p=9.726E(-15)) of the cell cycle in heart is nearly identical to its role in brain. In addition, Brca1 and 12 members of the Brca1 associated genome surveillance complex are also downregulated. Activation of caspase 3 coincides with transcriptional repression of Bcl-2. Hltf loss caused downregulation of Wt1/Gata4/Hif-1a signaling cascades as well as Myh7b/miR499 transcription. Hltf-specific binding to promoters and/or regulatory regions of these genes was authenticated by ChIP-PCR. Hif-1a targets for prolyl (P4ha1, P4ha2) and lysyl (Plod2) collagen hydroxylation, PPIase enzymes (Ppid, Ppif, Ppil3) for collagen trimerization, and lysyl oxidase (Loxl2) for collagen-elastin crosslinking were downregulated. However, transcription of genes for collagens, fibronectin, Mmps and their inhibitors (Timps) was unaffected. The collective downregulation of genes whose protein products control collagen biogenesis caused disorganization of the interstitial and perivascular myocardial collagen fibrillar network as viewed with picrosirius red-staining, and authenticated with spectral imaging. Wavy collagen bundles in control hearts contrasted with collagen fibers that were thin, short and disorganized in Hltf null hearts. Collagen bundles in Hltf null hearts were tangled and fragmented. Thus, silencing Hltf during heart organogenesis compromised DNA double-strand break repair, and caused aberrant collagen biogenesis altering the structural network that transmits cardiomyocyte force into muscle contraction. 
Cushing's syndrome or hypercortisolism is a common endocrinopathy in dogs. In approximately 15% of cases, the disorder is caused by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-independent hypersecretion of cortisol by an adrenocortical tumor (AT). Without other explanation, the cortisol hypersecretion has been referred to as autonomous.
To investigate whether ACTH-independent hypersecretion of cortisol may be associated with aberrant activation of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R)-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.
All analyses were performed on 44 cortisol-secreting ATs (14 adenomas and 30 carcinomas) derived from dogs diagnosed with ACTH-independent hypercortisolism.
Mutation analysis was performed of genes encoding the stimulatory G protein alpha subunit (GNAS), MC2R, and PKA regulatory subunit 1A (PRKAR1A) in all ATs.
Approximately one-third of all ATs harbored an activating mutation of GNAS. Missense mutations, known to result in constitutive activation, were present in codon 201 in 11 ATs, in codon 203 (1 AT), and in codon 227 (3 ATs). No functional mutations were found in MC2R and PRKAR1A.
Activation of cAMP signaling is a frequent event in canine cortisol-secreting ATs and may play a crucial role in both ACTH-independent cortisol production and tumor formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of potentially causative mutations in canine cortisol-secreting ATs.
The present investigation was carried out to elucidate a possible molecular mechanism related to the effects of aluminium-induced oxidative stress on various mitochondrial respiratory complex subunits with special emphasis on the role of Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and its downstream targets i.e. Nuclear respiratory factor-1(NRF-1), Nuclear respiratory factor-2(NRF-2) and Mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in mitochondrial biogenesis. Aluminium lactate (10mg/kgb.wt./day) was administered intragastrically to rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of exposure, we found an increase in ROS levels, mitochondrial DNA oxidation and decrease in citrate synthase activity in the Hippocampus (HC) and Corpus striatum (CS) regions of rat brain. On the other hand, there was a decrease in the mRNA levels of the mitochondrial encoded subunits-NADH dehydrogenase (ND) subunits i.e. ND1, ND2, ND3, Cytochrome b (Cytb), Cytochrome oxidase (COX) subunits i.e. COX1, COX3, ATP synthase (ATPase) subunit 6 along with reduced expression of nuclear encoded subunits COX4, COX5A, COX5B of Electron transport chain (ETC). Besides, a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial content in both regions of rat brain was observed. The PGC-1α was down-regulated in aluminium treated rats along with NRF-1, NRF-2 and Tfam, which act downstream from PGC-1α in aluminium treated rats. Electron microscopy results revealed a significant increase in the mitochondrial swelling, loss of cristae, chromatin condensation and decreases in mitochondrial number in case of aluminium treated rats as compared to control. So, PGC-1α seems to be a potent target for aluminium neurotoxicity, which makes it an almost ideal target to control or limit the damage that has been associated with the defective mitochondrial function seen in neurodegenerative diseases.
The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release channel or ryanodine receptor (RyR) of the vertebrate heart is regulated by the FK506-binding proteins, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. This study examines whether temperature-related changes in the SR function of fish hearts are associated with changes in FKBP12 expression. For this purpose, a polyclonal antibody against trout FKBP12 was used to compare FKPB12 expression in cold-acclimated (4 °C, CA) and warm-acclimated (18 °C, WA) rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), burbot (Lota lota) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius) hearts. FKBP12 expression was modulated in a species- and tissue-specific manner. Temperature acclimation affected FKBP12 expression only in atrial tissue. Changes in the ventricular FKBP12 expression were not detected in any of the fish species. In the atria of rainbow trout and crucian carp, temperature acclimation produced opposite thermal responses: FKBP12 increased in the trout atrium and decreased in the crucian carp atrium under cold acclimation. In the burbot heart, chronic temperature changes did not affect cardiac FKBP12 levels. Expression of FKBP12 mRNA in rainbow trout and crucian carp hearts suggests that the transcript levels are higher in the ventricle than in the atrium and are elevated by cold acclimation in trout, but not in crucian carp. Since FKBP12 is known to increase the Ca(2+) sensitivity of cardiac RyRs and thereby the opening frequency of the Ca(2+) release channels, temperature-related changes in FKBP12 expression may modify the SR function in excitation-contraction coupling. The cold-induced increase in FKBP12 in the trout atrium and decrease in the crucian carp atrium are consistent with the previously noted increase and decrease, respectively, of SR Ca(2+) stores in cardiac contraction in these species. 
The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) transports cholesterol to the mitochondria for steroidogenesis. Loss of StAR function causes lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LCAH) which is characterized by impaired synthesis of adrenal and gonadal steroids causing adrenal insufficiency, 46,XY disorder of sex development (DSD) and failure of pubertal development. Partial loss of StAR activity may cause adrenal insufficiency only.
A newborn girl was admitted for mild dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycaemia and had normal external female genitalia without hyperpigmentation. Plasma cortisol, 17OH-progesterone, DHEA-S, androstendione and aldosterone were low, while ACTH and plasma renin activity were elevated, consistent with the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency. Imaging showed normal adrenals, and cytogenetics revealed a 46,XX karyotype. She was treated with fluids, hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
Genetic studies revealed a novel homozygous STAR mutation in the 3' acceptor splice site of intron 4, c.466-1G&gt;A (IVS4-1G&gt;A). To test whether this mutation would affect splicing, we performed a minigene experiment with a plasmid construct containing wild-type or mutant StAR gDNA of exons-introns 4-6 in COS-1 cells. The splicing was assessed on total RNA using RT-PCR for STAR cDNAs. The mutant STAR minigene skipped exon 5 completely and changed the reading frame. Thus, it is predicted to produce an aberrant and shorter protein (p.V156GfsX19). Computational analysis revealed that this mutant protein lacks wild-type exons 5-7 which are essential for StAR-cholesterol interaction.
STAR c.466-1A skips exon 5 and causes a dramatic change in the C-terminal sequence of the protein, which is essential for StAR-cholesterol interaction. This splicing mutation is a loss-of-function mutation explaining the severe phenotype of our patient. Thus far, all reported splicing mutations of STAR cause a severe impairment of protein function and phenotype.
Vitamin E is the generic name for tocopherol (Toc) and tocotrienol (T3), which have saturated and unsaturated side chains, respectively. Such differences allow T3 to be different from Toc in terms of their functions. T3 has been known to attenuate cholesterol (Cho) level by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR). Recent reports also showed the efficacy of T3 in improving triglyceride (TG) profiles in both in vivo and in vitro studies. However the mechanism involved in this biological activity is still unclear and needs to be further investigated. In the present study, we elucidated the effect of γ-T3 on lipid levels and lipogenic gene expressions in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma Hepa 1-6. γ-T3 showed attenuation of TG through effect on fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A gene expression in Hepa 1-6. In contrast, the Cho level remained unchanged. These results expanded our previous finding of lipid-lowering effects of T3, especially for TG. Therefore, T3 is a potential lipid-lowering compound candidate with realistic prospects for its use as a therapy for lipid-related diseases in humans.
Preservation of bioenergetic homeostasis during the transition from the carbohydrate-laden fetal diet to the high fat, low carbohydrate neonatal diet requires inductions of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Mice with loss-of-function mutation in the extrahepatic mitochondrial enzyme CoA transferase (succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase, SCOT, encoded by nuclear Oxct1) cannot terminally oxidize ketone bodies and develop lethal hyperketonemic hypoglycemia within 48 h of birth. Here we use this model to demonstrate that loss of ketone body oxidation, an exclusively extrahepatic process, disrupts hepatic intermediary metabolic homeostasis after high fat mother's milk is ingested. Livers of SCOT-knock-out (SCOT-KO) neonates induce the expression of the genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1a (PGC-1α), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate carboxylase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, and the neonate's pools of gluconeogenic alanine and lactate are each diminished by 50%. NMR-based quantitative fate mapping of (13)C-labeled substrates revealed that livers of SCOT-KO newborn mice synthesize glucose from exogenously administered pyruvate. However, the contribution of exogenous pyruvate to the tricarboxylic acid cycle as acetyl-CoA is increased in SCOT-KO livers and is associated with diminished terminal oxidation of fatty acids. After mother's milk provokes hyperketonemia, livers of SCOT-KO mice diminish de novo hepatic β-hydroxybutyrate synthesis by 90%. Disruption of β-hydroxybutyrate production increases hepatic NAD(+)/NADH ratios 3-fold, oxidizing redox potential in liver but not skeletal muscle. Together, these results indicate that peripheral ketone body oxidation prevents hypoglycemia and supports hepatic metabolic homeostasis, which is critical for the maintenance of glycemia during the adaptation to birth. 
Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies and remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Over 70% of new cases and deaths occur in developing countries. In the early years of the molecular biology revolution, cancer research mainly focuses on genetic alterations, including gastric cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for normal development and maintenance of tissue-specific gene expression patterns in mammals. Disruption of epigenetic processes can lead to altered gene function and malignant cellular transformation. Recent advancements in the rapidly evolving field of cancer epigenetics have shown extensive reprogramming of every component of the epigenetic machinery in cancer, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. Aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter regions of gene, which leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes in cancer cells, is the most well-defined epigenetic hallmark in gastric cancer. The advantages of gene methylation as a target for detection and diagnosis of cancer in biopsy specimens and non-invasive body fluids such as serum and gastric washes have led to many studies of application in gastric cancer. This review focuses on the most common and important phenomenon of epigenetics, DNA methylation, in gastric cancer and illustrates the impact epigenetics has had on this field. 
The somatotropic axis is a key metabolic pathway during transition from late pregnancy to early lactation in dairy cows. The first objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of selecting cows with persistent differences in total insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentration by taking only a single antepartum blood sample. The second objective was to elucidate the underlying causes of differences in peripheral IGF-1 concentrations throughout late pregnancy and whether hormonal axes also differed in dairy cows with low versus high IGF-1. Twenty clinically healthy Holstein Friesian cows were chosen based on their plasma IGF-1 concentration at 244 to 254 d after artificial insemination (AI) and other selection criteria (health status, body condition score, number of lactations). These cows were selected from a large-scale farm, transported to the clinic, and monitored daily from 261 to 275 d after AI. The concentrations of IGF-1, growth hormone, IGF binding proteins 2, 3, and 4, insulin, cortisol, thyroid hormones, progesterone, and estradiol were measured. Ultimately, 7 IGF-1-low and 7 IGF-1-high cows were statistically analyzed. Additionally, a liver biopsy was taken on d 270 ± 1 after AI for analysis of gene expression of somatotropic family members, liver deiodinase 1, and suppressor of cytokine signaling-2. It was possible to select cows with different IGF-1 concentrations based upon only 1 blood sample collected in late pregnancy. Concentrations of IGF-1 in IGF-1-low versus IGF-1-high animals (n=7 each) remained significantly different between groups from the day of selection of the animals until d 275 after AI. Second, the differences in total plasma IGF-1 concentration between experimental groups may be attributed to differences in hepatic production of acid labile subunit. The ability of IGFBP-3 to bind IGF-1 declined before calving in all cows. Furthermore, in addition to decreased mRNA expression of growth hormone receptor 1A and IGF-1 relative to calving, serum binding capacities for IGF-1 also decreased. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 mRNA expression was higher in cows with low IGF-1 concentrations; this binding protein inhibits IGF-1 action at the tissue level and therefore may reduce IGF-1 bioavailability. Finally, other endocrine end points (e.g., insulin and thyroid hormones) differed between the 2 groups.
Little is known about the hypolipidemic activity of okra; therefore, we investigated the hypolipidemic activity of okra and its interaction with gene expression of several key components involved in lipid homeostasis. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups and fed with hyperlipidemic diet or two hyperlipidemic diets supplemented with 1% or 2% okra powder for eight weeks. Results demonstrated that okra dose-dependently decreased serum and hepatic total cholesterol and triglyceride, and enhanced fecal excretion of bile acids. Gene expression analysis revealed that okra upregulated cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression, downregulated expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), with no effect on sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A). It was suggested that hypolipidemic activity of okra was mediated most likely by upregulation of cholesterol degradation through CYP7A1 and by inhibition of lipogenesis through SREBP1c and FAS. Okra raw and fractionated polysaccharide showed strong bile acid binding capacity in vitro, which may contribute to the hypolipidemic activity observed. In conclusion, okra has potential application in the management of hyperlipidemia and its associated metabolic disorders.
Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) is a causative gene for autosomal recessive infantile and juvenile proximal spinal muscular atrophy. SMN1 duplications have recently been found to increase susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The role of centromeric SMN copy (SMN2) has been postulated in progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). The aim of this study was to analyse the SMN1 and SMN2 copy number variations in patients with PMA. SMN1 and SMN2 genotype was studied in 87 patients with PMA, diagnosed at the Department of Neurology, Medical University of Warsaw, between 1992 and 2012 and in 600 healthy controls. Results demonstrated that three copies of SMN1 were found in 8.1% of PMA patients and in 24% of PMA patients with disease duration above 48 months compared to 4.6% of the general population. Patients with three SMN1 copies had a limb onset, lower median age of onset and longer disease duration compared to patients with two SMN1 copies. There were no significant differences in the SMN2 copy numbers. In conclusion, the increased copy number of SMN1 may be a susceptibility factor to PMA and influence the clinical phenotype.
The human POZ domain and Krüppel-like zinc finger (POK) family proteins play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation, development, oncogenesis, and tumor suppression. A novel POK family transcription factor, BTB/POZ and zinc finger domains factor on chromosome 1 (BOZF-1; also called ZBTB8A), contains a POZ domain and two C2H2-type Krüppel-like zinc fingers and is localized at nuclear speckles. Compared with paired normal tissues, BOZF1 expression is increased in cancer tissues of the prostate, breast, and cervix. BOZF1 repressed the transcription of p21WAF/CDKN1A by acting on the proximal promoter concentrated with Sp1-binding GC boxes. BOZF1 competed with Sp1 in binding to GC boxes 1-5/6 of the CDKN1A proximal promoter. In addition, BOZF1 interacted with p53 and decreased the acetylation of p53 by p300, which reduced the DNA binding activity of p53 at the far distal p53-binding element. BOZF1 blocked the two major molecular events that are important in both constitutive and inducible transcription activation of CDKN1A. BOZF1 is unique in that it bound to all the proximal GC boxes to repress transcription, and it inhibited p53 acetylation without affecting p53 stability. BOZF1 might be a novel proto-oncoprotein that stimulates cell proliferation.
Metabolic syndrome (coexisting visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension) is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, however, its effect on cardiac gene expression pattern is unclear. Therefore, we examined the possible alterations in cardiac gene expression pattern in male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, a model of metabolic syndrome.
Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured at 6, 16, and 25 wk of age in male ZDF and lean control rats. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed at 16 and 25 wk of age. At week 25, total RNA was isolated from the myocardium and assayed by rat oligonucleotide microarray for 14921 genes. Expression of selected genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR.
Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly increased, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were impaired in ZDF rats compared to leans. In hearts of ZDF rats, 36 genes showed significant up-regulation and 49 genes showed down-regulation as compared to lean controls. Genes with significantly altered expression in the heart due to metabolic syndrome includes functional clusters of metabolism (e.g. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A synthase 2; argininosuccinate synthetase; 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate-coenzyme A ligase), structural proteins (e.g. myosin IXA; aggrecan1), signal transduction (e.g. activating transcription factor 3; phospholipase A2; insulin responsive sequence DNA binding protein-1) stress response (e.g. heat shock 70kD protein 1A; heat shock protein 60; glutathione S-transferase Yc2 subunit), ion channels and receptors (e.g. ATPase, (Na+)/K+ transporting, beta 4 polypeptide; ATPase, H+/K+ transporting, nongastric, alpha polypeptide). Moreover some other genes with no definite functional clusters were also changed such as e.g. S100 calcium binding protein A3; ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1; interleukin 18. Gene ontology analysis revealed several significantly enriched functional inter-relationships between genes influenced by metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome significantly alters cardiac gene expression profile which may be involved in development of cardiac pathologies in the presence of metabolic syndrome.
Neurons adapt to seizure activity structurally and functionally to attenuate hyperactive neural circuits. Homer proteins provide a scaffold in the postsynaptic density (PSD) by binding to ligands through an EVH1 domain and to other Homer proteins by a coiled-coil domain. The short Homer isoform 1a (H1a) has a ligand-binding domain but lacks a coiled-coil domain and thus acts in a dominant-negative manner to uncouple Homer scaffolds. Here, we show that treating rat hippocampal cultures with bicuculline and 4-aminopyridine (Bic+4-AP) evoked epileptiform activity and synchronized Ca(2+) spiking, measured with whole cell current-clamp and fura-2-based digital imaging; Bic+4-AP increased H1a mRNA through the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Treatment with Bic+4-AP for 4 h attenuated burst firing and induced synapse loss. Synaptic changes were measured using a confocal imaging-based assay that quantified clusters of PSD-95 fused to green fluorescent protein. Treatment with an mGluR5 antagonist blocked H1a expression, synapse loss, and burst attenuation. Overexpression of H1a inhibited burst firing similar to Bic+4-AP treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of H1a using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy reduced synapse loss and burst attenuation induced by Bic+4-AP treatment. Thus an epileptiform stimulus applied to hippocampal neurons in culture induced burst firing and H1a expression through the activation of mGluR5; a 4-h exposure to this stimulus resulted in synapse loss and burst attenuation. These results suggest that H1a expression functions in a negative-feedback manner to reduce network excitability by regulating the number of synapses.
To investigate the regulation of DNA methylation on the expression of MMP-2 gene, and the effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) on invasiveness of endometrial cancer cells.
Human endometrial cancer cell lines Ishikawa and HEC-1A were treated with 5-aza-CdR. After genomic DNA was extracted from the cells and treated with bisulfate sodium, clone sequencing was used to detect methylation of the matrix  metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) promoter region. Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells were treated with different concentrations of 5-aza-CdR, and the effect  on the invasion and metastasis to the endometrial cancer (EC) cells were detected by Transwell invasion chamber. The MMP-2 mRNA expression was  detected by real-time quantitative PCR.
Although the MMP-2 promoter showed global hypomethylation status, the methylation of CG  dinucleotide sites located on the transcription factor binding sites had high positive frequencies, which were 80% and 70% in HEC-1A cells and 60% and  40% in Ishikawa cells, respectively. The methylation frequencies reduced to 20% and 10% in HEC-1A cells by demethylating agent 5-aza-CdR and the  CG sites in Ishikawa cells were totally demethylated. Moreover, after 72 h of treatment with different concentrations of 5-aza-CdR, the expression of the  MMP-2 mRNA and transmembrane number of both Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells were significantly upregulated compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05).
Methylation of CG dinucleotide sites of the MMP-2 promotor region may be associated with the regulation of gene transcription. The 5-aza-CdR can promote the invasion and metastasis of endometrial cancer cells in vitro by upregulating the MMP-2 mRNA expression.
Previous reports from these authors found that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study sought to identify the molecular target of PPARγ and characterize its antitumor effect in HCC.
Optimal PPARγ binding activity was obtained using the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (100 μM) as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Under PPARγ activation, 114 PPARγ downstream targets associated with cancer development were identified by oligonucleotide microarray and Gene Ontology analysis. Among them, Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator, with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain, 2 (CITED2) was the most prominent PPARγ-bound target, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction.
CITED2 messenger RNA and protein was significantly down-regulated in primary HCCs compared with their adjacent nontumor tissues. PPARγ induced expression of CITED2 in HCC cell lines after adenovirus-PPARγ transduction. The biological function of CITED2 was evaluated by loss- and gain-of-function assays. CITED2 knockdown in the hepatocyte cell line LO2 and HCC cell line Hep3B significantly increased cell viability and clonogenicity, and promoted G1 -S phase transition in both cell lines. In contrast, ectopic expression of CITED2 in HepG2 and BEL7404 HCC cell lines significantly suppressed cell growth. The tumor suppressive effect of CITED2 was associated with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15(INK4B) , p21(Wat1/Cip1) , p27(Kip1) , antiproliferative regulator interferon alpha 1, proapoptotic mediators including tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A), TNFRSF25, caspase-8, granzyme A, and the tumor suppressor gene maspin. CITED2 was also associated with the down-regulation of cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, oncogene telomerase reverse transcriptase, and proinvasion/metastasis gene matrix metallopeptidase 2.

Metallothioneins (MT) are intracellular, low molecular weight proteins (6-7 kDa) involved in binding of metal ions, scavenging of free radicals, cell proliferation and apoptosis and resistance to certain chemotherapeutics. Four basic families of MT proteins are distinguished: MT-I, MT-II, MT-III, MT-IV, within each of them different isoforms occur. The study aimed at examining the expression level of nine MT isoforms: MT-1A, -1B, -1E, -1F, -1G, -1H, -1X, MT-2A and MT-IV by using real-time PCR and MT-I/II expression by immunohistochemical (IHC) technique in 69 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 12 non-malignant lung tissues (NMLT) and to correlate them with patients clinicopathological data and Ki-67 antigen expression. Out of all the analyzed cases, 62 (89.9%) demonstrated an increased MT-I/II expression. MT-1B, 1F, -1G, -1H and MT-1X were significantly up-regulated, whereas MT-1E was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC as compared to NMLT. Only in two cases MT-IV mRNA expression was noted. Significant positive correlations were observed between each particular MT isoform expressions. Higher MT-1F and MT-1A mRNA expression was associated with larger primary tumor size (P=0.0362 and P&lt;0.0001, respectively). Moreover, up-regulated MT-1F mRNA expression was associated with higher grade of malignancy of NSCLC (P=0.0085). Higher MT-1B mRNA expression was associated with squamocellular and adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC (P=0.0358). Univariate analysis showed, that up-regulated MT-1F and MT-2A mRNA predicted poor patients' survival (P=0.0206 and P=0.0097, respectively). The levels of MT-1F and MT-2A mRNA could be considered as new markers of poor prognosis of NSCLC patients.
Phoneutria nigriventer toxin Tx1 (PnTx1, also referred to in the literature as Tx1) exerts inhibitory effect on neuronal (Na(V)1.2) sodium channels in a way dependent on the holding potential, and competes with μ-conotoxins but not with tetrodotoxin for their binding sites. In the present study we investigated the electrophysiological properties of the recombinant toxin (rPnTx1), which has the complete amino acid sequence of the natural toxin with 3 additional residues: AM on the N-terminal and G on the C-terminal. At the concentration of 1.5 μM, the recombinant toxin inhibits Na(+) currents of dorsal root ganglia neurons (38.4 ± 6.1% inhibition at -80 mV holding potential) and tetrodotoxin-resistant Na(+) currents (26.2 ± 4.9% at the same holding potential). At -50 mV holding potential the inhibition of the total current reached 71.3 ± 2.3% with 1.5 μM rPnTx1. The selectivity of rPnTx1 was investigated on ten different isoforms of voltage-gated sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The order of potency for rPnTx1 was: rNa(V)1.2 &gt; rNa(V)1.7 ≈ rNa(V)1.4 ≥ rNa(V)1.3 &gt; mNa(V)1.6 ≥ hNa(V)1.8. No effect was seen on hNa(V)1.5 and on the arthropods isoforms (DmNa(V)1, BGNa(V)1.1a and VdNa(V)1). The IC(50) for Na(V)1.2 was 33.7 ± 2.9 nM with a maximum inhibition of 83.3 ± 1.9%. The toxin did not alter the voltage-dependence of channel gating and was effective on Na(V)1.2 channels devoid of inactivation. It was ineffective on neuronal calcium channels. We conclude that rPnTx1 has a promising selectivity, and that it may be a valuable model to achieve pharmacological activities of interest for the treatment of channelopathies and neuropathic pain.
Position-dependent patterning of hair and non-hair cells in the Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is a powerful system to study the molecular basis of cell fate specification. Here, we report an epidermal patterning mutant affecting the ADENOSINE DIMETHYL TRANSFERASE 1A (DIM1A) rRNA dimethylase gene, predicted to participate in rRNA posttranscriptional processing and base modification. Consistent with a role in ribosome biogenesis, DIM1A is preferentially expressed in regions of rapid growth, and its product is nuclear localized with nucleolus enrichment. Furthermore, DIM1A preferentially accumulates in the developing hair cells, and the dim1A point mutant alters the cell-specific expression of the transcriptional regulators GLABRA2, CAPRICE, and WEREWOLF. Together, these findings suggest that establishment of cell-specific gene expression during root epidermis development is dependent upon proper ribosome biogenesis, possibly due to the sensitivity of the cell fate decision to relatively small differences in gene regulatory activities. Consistent with its effect on the predicted S-adenosyl-l-Met binding site, dim1A plants lack the two 18S rRNA base modifications but exhibit normal pre-rRNA processing. In addition to root epidermal defects, the dim1A mutant exhibits abnormal root meristem division, leaf development, and trichome branching. Together, these findings provide new insights into the importance of rRNA base modifications and translation regulation for plant growth and development.
Because of the extreme genetic variability of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we analyzed whether specific HCV-genotypes are differently prone to develop resistance to linear and macrocyclic protease-inhibitors (PIs).
The study includes 1568 NS3-protease sequences, isolated from PI-naive patients infected with HCV-genotypes 1a (N = 621), 1b (N = 474), 2 (N = 72), 3 (N = 268), 4 (N = 54) 5 (N = 6), and 6 (N = 73). Genetic-barrier was calculated as the sum of nucleotide-transitions (score = 1) and/or nucleotide-transversions (score = 2.5) required for drug-resistance-mutations emergence. Forty-three mutations associated with PIs-resistance were analyzed (36A/M/L/G-41R-43S/V-54A/S/V-55A-Q80K/R/L/H/G-109K-138T-155K/Q/T/I/M/S/G/L-156T/V/G/S-158I-168A/H/T/V/E/I/G/N/Y-170A/T-175L). Structural analyses on NS3-protease and on putative RNA-models have been also performed.
Overall, NS3-protease was moderately conserved, with 85/181 (47.0%) amino-acids showing &lt;1% variability. The catalytic-triad (H57-D81-S139) and 6/13 resistance-associated positions (Q41-F43-R109-R155-A156-V158) were fully conserved (variability &lt;1%). Structural-analysis highlighted that most of the NS3-residues involved in drug-stabilization were highly conserved, while 7 PI-resistance residues, together with selected residues located in proximity of the PI-binding pocket, were highly variable among HCV-genotypes. Four resistance-mutations (80K/G-36L-175L) were found as natural polymorphisms in selected genotypes (80K present in 41.6% HCV-1a, 100% of HCV-5 and 20.6% HCV-6; 80G present in 94.4% HCV-2; 36L present in 100% HCV-3-5 and &gt;94% HCV-2-4; 175L present in 100% HCV-1a-3-5 and &gt;97% HCV-2-4). Furthermore, HCV-3 specifically showed non-conservative polymorphisms (R123T-D168Q) at two drug-interacting positions. Regardless of HCV-genotype, 13 PIs resistance-mutations were associated with low genetic-barrier, requiring only 1 nucleotide-substitution (41R-43S/V-54A-55A-80R-156V/T: score = 1; 54S-138T-156S/G-168E/H: score = 2.5). By contrast, by using HCV-1b as reference genotype, nucleotide-heterogeneity led to a lower genetic-barrier for the development of some drug-resistance-mutations in HCV-1a (36M-155G/I/K/M/S/T-170T), HCV-2 (36M-80K-155G/I/K/S/T-170T), HCV-3 (155G/I/K/M/S/T-170T), HCV-4-6 (155I/S/L), and HCV-5 (80G-155G/I/K/M/S/T).
The high degree of HCV genetic variability makes HCV-genotypes, and even subtypes, differently prone to the development of PIs resistance-mutations. Overall, this can account for different responsiveness of HCV-genotypes to PIs, with important clinical implications in tailoring individualized and appropriate regimens.
The objective of this study was to characterize the circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and the hepatic expression of key genes regulating the somatotropic axis in cows divergent in genetic merit for fertility traits but with similar genetic merit for milk production traits. A total of 11 cows with good genetic merit for fertility (Fert+) and 12 cows with poor genetic merit for fertility (Fert-) underwent liver biopsy by percutaneous punch technique on d 20 (±6.7 d) prepartum and on d 2 (±1.5 d), d 58 (±3.7 d), d 145 (±13 d), and d 245 (±17.1 d) postpartum. Total RNA was isolated and the mRNA expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR 1A and GHRtot), IGF-I, janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), acid-labile subunit (ALS), and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP1 to IGFBP6) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. During lactation, the circulating concentrations of IGF-I were 34% greater in Fert+ cows. The Fert+ cows had increased mean expression of IGF-I mRNA during the study; however, the difference in IGF-I mRNA abundance between Fert+ and Fert- cows was most pronounced at d 145 and 245. The expression of IGFBP3 and ALS transcript was similar in Fert+ and Fert- cows for the duration of the study. The Fert- cows, however, had greater expression of IGFBP2, IGFBP4, IGFBP5, and IGFBP6. Genotype had no effect on mRNA abundance of GHR 1A, STAT5B, JAK2, or SOCS-3. Genetic merit for fertility traits affects hepatic expression of key genes of the somatotropic axis regulating the synthesis, bioavailability, and stability of circulating IGF-I.
We hypothesized that resveratrol administration would reverse sepsis-dependent downregulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, preserve mitochondrial integrity, and rescue animals from sepsis-induced myocardial failure.
Teaching hospital research laboratory.
Cecal ligation and puncture in mice was performed to induce sepsis. Mice that underwent cecal ligation and puncture were randomly assigned to receive resveratrol (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg) or vehicle 1 mL sodium chloride 0.9% subcutaneously in the scruff of the neck directly after surgery and at 16, 24, and 40 hrs, respectively.
Forty-eight hrs after cecal ligation and puncture, cardiac performance was established using echocardiography. Mitochondrial integrity was evaluated with electron microscopy, and changes in gene expression were evaluated with microarray analysis. Survival at 48 hrs was just under 50% and comparable between groups. Myocardial contractile function significantly improved after resveratrol treatment. Resveratrol-treated mice developed focal areas of edema, whereas vehicle-treated mice developed significant, diffuse myocardial edema. Electron microscopy revealed widespread swollen mitochondria with ruptured outer membranes, autophagosomes, and vacuolation of the internal compartment, which were significantly attenuated in resveratrol-treated animals. Resveratrol treatment significantly increased cardiac expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1a. Microarray analysis revealed that resveratrol treatment resulted in upregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator gene set containing genes known to be regulated by this transcriptional coactivator. Our data strongly suggest that administration of resveratrol modulates bioenergy metabolism, substrate utilization, oxidative stress, and detoxification pathways associated with both mitochondrial and cardiac pathological conditions, but does not alter mortality from sepsis.
The salutary effects of resveratrol on cecal ligation and puncture-induced myocardial dysfunction are associated with increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1a abundance and function. Preservation of myocardial energy production capacity, prevention of secondary injury, mitigation of inflammation, and reversal of sepsis-induced myocardial remodeling are likely to underlie its beneficial effects. This however, does not result in improved survival.
Upon viral recognition, innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses are initiated by genital epithelial cells (ECs) to eradicate or contain viral infection. Such responses, however, are often accompanied by inflammation that contributes to acquisition and progression of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Hence, interventions/factors enhancing antiviral protection while reducing inflammation may prove beneficial in controlling the spread of STIs. Serine antiprotease trappin-2 (Tr) and its cleaved form, elafin (E), are alarm antimicrobials secreted by multiple cells, including genital epithelia.
We investigated whether and how each Tr and E (Tr/E) contribute to antiviral defenses against a synthetic mimic of viral dsRNA, polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and vesicular stomatitis virus. We show that delivery of a replication-deficient adenovector expressing Tr gene (Ad/Tr) to human endometrial epithelial cells, HEC-1A, resulted in secretion of functional Tr, whereas both Tr/E were detected in response to polyI:C. Moreover, Tr/E were found to significantly reduce viral replication by either acting directly on virus or through enhancing polyI:C-driven antiviral protection. The latter was associated with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors IL-8, IL-6, TNFα, lowered expression of RIG-I, MDA5 and attenuated NF-κB activation. Interestingly, enhanced polyI:C-driven antiviral protection of HEC-Ad/Tr cells was partially mediated through IRF3 activation, but not associated with higher induction of IFNβ, suggesting multiple antiviral mechanisms of Tr/E and the involvement of alternative factors or pathways.
This is the first evidence of both Tr/E altering viral binding/entry, innate recognition and mounting of antiviral and inflammatory responses in genital ECs that could have significant implications for homeostasis of the female genital tract.
Vitamin D receptor activation with paricalcitol can modulate the transcription of renin-angiotensin system components in the surgical 5/6 nephrectomy rat model (5/6 NX) of chronic renal insufficiency. We tested the hypothesis whether dietary modification of phosphate influences kidney renin-angiotensin system gene expression at the mRNA level in 5/6 NX rats.
Fifteen weeks after surgery, rats were given control diet (0.3% calcium, 0.5% phosphate), phosphate-lowering diet (3% calcium as carbonate) or high-phosphate diet (1.5%) for 12 weeks. Sham-operated rats were on control diet.
Blood pressure, plasma phosphate, parathyroid hormone, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, and FGF-23 were increased in remnant kidney rats, whereas creatinine clearance was decreased. Phosphate, parathyroid hormone, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, and FGF-23 were further elevated by the high-phosphate diet, but were reduced by the phosphate-lowering diet. Plasma calcium was increased with the phosphate-lowering diet and decreased with the high-phosphate diet. Remnant kidney rats on control diet showed upregulated kidney angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin (Ang) IV receptor (AT(4)) transcription, while ACE2, Ang II type 2 receptor and renin receptor transcription were downregulated in comparison with sham rats. Phosphate-lowering diet reduced whereas high-phosphate diet increased kidney ACE, and these effects were observed at both mRNA and protein levels. Dietary phosphate loading also resulted in lower AT(1a) gene transcription.
Dietary phosphate loading was associated with elevated kidney ACE expression, increased tissue damage and lower AT(1a) transcription in 5/6 NX rats. Phosphate binding with 3% calcium carbonate had opposite effects on ACE and kidney damage.
Osteomyelitis is defined as an inflammation of the bones and bone marrow. The inflammatory microenvironment attenuates the osteogenic differentiation capacity of stem cells and inhibits osteoblast-mediated bone formation, leading to net bone loss. However, the whole expression profile, function and side effect of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) on osteogenic differentiation of stem cells in an inflammatory microenvironment of osteomyelitis are not known.
In the present study, human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) were treated with different concentrations of Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) to trigger an inflammatory microenvironment in vitro to partly duplicate the inflammatory microenvironment of osteomyelitis, which was confirmed using ELISA for detecting the inflammatory cytokines. The complete expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNA during osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in an inflammatory microenvironment triggered by SpA were analyzed using a lncRNA microarray. LncRNA expression levels were verified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis (qRT-PCR). The expression of NONHSAT009968 in hB-MSCs was silenced by infection with lentivirus expressing NONHSAT009968-shRNA. The expression of Runx2, OCN, OPN, COL1A1, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was detected by western blot. Alizarin red staining and ALP activity detection were carried out.
The results of ELISA showed that SpA treatment induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-1A, IL-6, and TNFA. The results of alizarin red staining and ALP detection showed that SpA treatment suppressed the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. A total of 2033 lncRNAs were found with aberrant expression in SpA-treated hBMSCs compared to controls. Among these lncRNAs, 641 were down-regulated and 1392 were up-regulated. Based on the results of qRT-PCR, lncRNA NONHSAT009968 was chosen for further investigation. The results of alizarin red staining, ALP activity detection, and western blot detection of Runx2, OCN, OPN, COL1A1, and ALP indicated that NONHSAT009968 silencing ameliorates SpA-inhibited osteogenic differentiation in hBMSCs.
Our present study provides a basis for future analyses of the role of lncRNAs in osteoblastic differentiation in an inflammatory environment triggered by SpA, and lncRNA NONHSAT009968 might be a new target for promoting osteoblast formation.
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, considered one of the leading causes of infant mortality. It is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. A highly homologous copy of this gene named SMN2 and other neighbouring genes, SERF1A and NAIP, are considered phenotypic modifiers of the disease. In recent years, notable advances have been made in SMA research regarding evaluation, prognosis, and therapeutic options. Thus, genotype-phenotype studies in SMA are important to stratify patients for motor function tests and for envisaged clinical trials. The aim of this study was to provide clinical and molecular data of a series of Argentinean children with SMA to establish a comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlation.
144 Argentinean children with SMA (56 children with type I, 58 with type II, and 30 with type III) were evaluated. The copy number of SMN2, SERF1A, and NAIP genes was established using MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification) and then correlated with the patients clinical subtypes. To improve clinical characterization we considered the initial symptoms that prompted the consultation, age of acquisition of motor abilities to independent walking and age at loss of gait. We also evaluated clinical and molecular features of sibling pairs in seven families.
A strong correlation was observed between the SMN2 copy number and SMA phenotype while SERF1A and NAIP copy number showed a moderate correlation. We observed intra- and inter-family differences among the SMA types.
This first genotype-phenotype correlation study in Argentinean SMA children provides data to improve patient stratification and define more adequate follow-up parameters.
In skeletal muscle, physical exercise and thyroid hormone mediate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1a) expression that is crucial to skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. The expression of type 2 deiodinase (D2), which activates thyroid hormone in skeletal muscle is upregulated by acute treadmill exercise through a β-adrenergic receptor-dependent mechanism. Pharmacological block of D2 or disruption of the Dio2 gene in skeletal muscle fibres impaired acute exercise-induced PGC-1a expression. Dio2 disruption also impaired muscle PGC-1a expression and mitochondrial citrate synthase activity in chronically exercised mice.
Thyroid hormone promotes expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1a), which mediates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle (SKM). Skeletal myocytes express the type 2 deiodinase (D2), which generates 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3 ), the active thyroid hormone. To test whether D2-generated T3 plays a role in exercise-induced PGC-1a expression, male rats and mice with SKM-specific Dio2 inactivation (SKM-D2KO or MYF5-D2KO) were studied. An acute treadmill exercise session (20 min at 70-75% of maximal aerobic capacity) increased D2 expression/activity (1.5- to 2.7-fold) as well as PGC-1a mRNA levels (1.5- to 5-fold) in rat soleus muscle and white gastrocnemius muscle and in mouse soleus muscle, which was prevented by pretreatment with 1 mg (100 g body weight)(-1) propranolol or 6 mg (100 g body weight)(-1) iopanoic acid (5.9- vs. 2.8-fold; P &lt; 0.05), which blocks D2 activity . In the SKM-D2KO mice, acute treadmill exercise failed to induce PGC-1a fully in soleus muscle (1.9- vs. 2.8-fold; P &lt; 0.05), and in primary SKM-D2KO myocytes there was only a limited PGC-1a response to 1 μm forskolin (2.2- vs. 1.3-fold; P &lt; 0.05). Chronic exercise training (6 weeks) increased soleus muscle PGC-1a mRNA levels (∼25%) and the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase (∼20%). In contrast, PGC-1a expression did not change and citrate synthase decreased by ∼30% in SKM-D2KO mice. The soleus muscle PGC-1a response to chronic exercise was also blunted in MYF5-D2KO mice. In conclusion, acute treadmill exercise increases SKM D2 expression through a β-adrenergic receptor-dependent mechanism. The accelerated conversion of T4 to T3 within myocytes mediates part of the PGC-1a induction by treadmill exercise and its downstream effects on mitochondrial function.
The role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been extensively investigated in the contexts of aging and cancer. Interestingly, Tert(-/-) mice exhibit additional but unexpected aggressive and depressive behaviors, implying the potential involvement of TERT function in mood control. Our conditional rescue experiments revealed that the depressive and aggressive behaviors of Tert(-/-) mice originate from Tert deficiency in two distinct brain structures. Reactivation of Tert in the hippocampus was sufficient to normalize the depressive but not the aggressive behaviors of Tert(-/-) mice. Conversely, re-expression of Tert in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reversed the aggressive but not the depressive behavior of Tert(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, decreased serotonergic signaling and increased nitric oxide (NO) transmission in the hippocampus transduced Tert deficiency into depression as evidenced by our observation that the infusion of a pharmacological agonist for serotonin receptor 1a (5-HTR1A) and a selective antagonist for neuronal NO synthase into the hippocampus successfully normalized the depressive behavior of Tert(-/-) mice. In addition, increased serotonergic transmission by the 5-HTR1A agonist in the mPFC was sufficient to rescue the aggressive behavior of Tert(-/-) mice. Thus, our studies revealed a novel function of TERT in the pathology of depression and aggression in a brain structure-specific manner, providing direct evidence for the contribution of TERT to emotional control.
The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) plays a key role in promoting stem elongation in plants. Previous studies show that GA activates its signaling pathway by inducing rapid degradation of DELLA proteins, GA signaling repressors. Using an activation-tagging screen in a reduced-GA mutant ga1-6 background, we identified AtERF11 to be a novel positive regulator of both GA biosynthesis and GA signaling for internode elongation. Overexpression of AtERF11 partially rescued the dwarf phenotype of ga1-6 AtERF11 is a member of the ERF (ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR) subfamily VIII-B-1a of ERF/AP2 transcription factors in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Overexpression of AtERF11 resulted in elevated bioactive GA levels by up-regulating expression of GA3ox1 and GA20ox genes. Hypocotyl elongation assays further showed that overexpression of AtERF11 conferred elevated GA response, whereas loss-of-function erf11 and erf11 erf4 mutants displayed reduced GA response. In addition, yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and transient expression assays showed that AtERF11 enhances GA signaling by antagonizing the function of DELLA proteins via direct protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, AtERF11 overexpression also caused a reduction in the levels of another phytohormone ethylene in the growing stem, consistent with recent finding showing that AtERF11 represses transcription of ethylene biosynthesis ACS genes. The effect of AtERF11 on promoting GA biosynthesis gene expression is likely via its repressive function on ethylene biosynthesis. These results suggest that AtERF11 plays a dual role in promoting internode elongation by inhibiting ethylene biosynthesis and activating GA biosynthesis and signaling pathways.
Frequent mutations have been described in the following 5 genes in uveal melanoma (UM): BAP1, EIF1AX, GNA11, GNAQ, and SF3B1. Understanding the prognostic significance of these mutations could facilitate their use in precision medicine.
To determine the associations between driver mutations, gene expression profile (GEP) classification, clinicopathologic features, and patient outcomes in UM.
Retrospective study of patients with UM treated by enucleation by a single ocular oncologist between November 1, 1998, and July 31, 2014.
Clinicopathologic features, patient outcomes, GEP classification (class 1 or class 2), and mutation status were recorded.
The study cohort comprised 81 participants. Their mean age was 61.5 years, and 37% (30 of 81) were female. The GEP classification was class 1 in 35 of 81 (43%), class 2 in 42 of 81 (52%), and unknown in 4 of 81 (5%). BAP1 mutations were identified in 29 of 64 (45%), GNAQ mutations in 36 of 81 (44%), GNA11 mutations in 36 of 81 (44%), SF3B1 mutations in 19 of 81 (24%), and EIF1AX mutations in 14 of 81 (17%). Sixteen of the mutations in BAP1 and 6 of the mutations in EIF1AX were previously unreported in UM. GNAQ and GNA11 mutations were mutually exclusive. BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX mutations were almost mutually exclusive with each other. Using multiple regression analysis, BAP1 mutations were associated with class 2 GEP and older patient. EIF1AX mutations were associated with class 1 GEP and the absence of ciliary body involvement. SF3B1 mutations were associated with younger patient age. GNAQ mutations were associated with the absence of ciliary body involvement and greater largest basal diameter. GNA11 mutations were not associated with any of the analyzed features. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, class 2 GEP was the prognostic factor most strongly associated with metastasis (relative risk, 9.4; 95% CI, 3.1-28.5) and melanoma-specific mortality (relative risk, 15.7; 95% CI, 3.6-69.1) (P &lt; .001 for both). After excluding GEP class, the presence of BAP1 mutations was the factor most strongly associated with metastasis (relative risk, 10.6; 95% CI, 3.4-33.5) and melanoma-specific mortality (relative risk, 9.0; 95% CI, 2.8-29.2) (P &lt; .001 for both).
BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX mutations occur during UM tumor progression in an almost mutually exclusive manner and are associated with different levels of metastatic risk. These mutations may have value as prognostic markers in UM.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is complicated by infectious exacerbations with acute worsening of respiratory symptoms. Coinfections of bacterial and viral pathogens are associated with more severe exacerbations. Moraxella catarrhalis is one of the most frequent lower respiratory tract pathogens detected in COPD. We therefore studied the impact of M. catarrhalis on the antiviral innate immune response that is mediated via TLR3 and p53. Molecular interactions between M. catarrhalis and normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells as well as Beas-2B cells were studied using flow cytometry, quantitative PCR analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA interference, and ELISA. M. catarrhalis induces a significant down-regulation of TLR3 in human bronchial epithelial cells. In M. catarrhalis-infected cells, expression of p53 was decreased. We detected a reduced binding of p53 to the tlr3 promoter, resulting in reduced TLR3 gene transcription. M. catarrhalis diminished the TLR3-dependent secretion of IFN-β, IFN-λ, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8. In addition in M. catarrhalis infected cells, expression of rhinovirus type 1A RNA was increased compared with uninfected cells. M. catarrhalis reduces antiviral defense functions of bronchial epithelial cells, which may increase susceptibility to viral infections.-Heinrich, A., Haarmann, H., Zahradnik, S., Frenzel, K., Schreiber, F., Klassert, T. E., Heyl, K. A., Endres, A.-S., Schmidtke, M., Hofmann, J., Slevogt, H. Moraxella catarrhalis decreases antiviral innate immune responses by down-regulation of TLR3 via inhibition of p53 in human bronchial epithelial cells.
Plastic production releases phthalate esters (PAEs), which can alter the expression of metallothioneins (MTs), fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) and heart fatty acid binding protein (HFABP). A total of 187 mother-infant pairs were recruited, 127 from Chenghai (high exposed group) and 60 from Haojiang (low exposed group), to investigate the association between neonatal PAE exposure and mRNA expression of placental MTs, FATP1 and HFABP. Umbilical cord blood and placenta samples were collected for measuring five PAE concentrations and detecting mRNA levels of MTs, FATP1 and HFABP. Butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) were significantly higher in the high exposed group compared to the low exposed group. FATP1 and HFABP mRNA in the high exposed group were higher than that in the low exposed group while MT-1A was contrary. Both dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and DEHP were correlated with higher MT and MT-2A expression, while diethyl phthalate (DEP) was also positively correlated with MT-1A and FATP1 expression in female infants. DEHP exposure was negatively correlated with birth weight and gestational age in male infants. These results show that neonatal PAE exposure alters the mRNA expression of placental MTs and FATP1, which are related to fetal growth and development.
The aim of this study was to determine the protective mechanisms of wild ginseng cambial meristematic cells (CMCs) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.
Male C57BL/6 mice received either normal-fat diet or HFD for 10 weeks along with wild ginseng CMCs (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5% carboxyl methyl cellulose) by oral administration once a day. Triglyceride and total cholesterol contents were measured in liver and serum samples. Parameters for hepatic lipid metabolism and mitochondria biogenesis were assessed.
Treatment with wild ginseng CMCs markedly attenuated body weight, serum and hepatic lipid contents, and serum aminotransferase activity. While wild ginseng CMCs attenuated the increases in sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) expression, it enhanced the increases in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) expression. HFD decreased glutamate dehydrogenase activity and glutathione content, and increased lipid peroxidation, which were all attenuated by wild ginseng CMCs. Furthermore, wild ginseng CMCs enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis-related factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co activator 1α (PGC1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM).
Wild ginseng CMCs protect against HFD-induced liver injury, which prevents lipid accumulation and mitochondrial oxidative stress, and enhances mitochondrial biogenesis.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the transcription factor SKN-1 has emerged as a central coordinator of stress responses and longevity, increasing the need for genetic tools to study its regulation and function. However, current loss-of-function alleles cause fully penetrant maternal effect embryonic lethality, and must be maintained with genetic balancers that require careful monitoring and labor intensive strategies to obtain large populations. In this study, we identified a strong, but viable skn-1 hypomorphic allele skn-1(zj15) from a genetic screen for suppressors of wdr-23, a direct regulator of the transcription factor. skn-1(zj15) is a point mutation in an intron that causes mis-splicing of a fraction of mRNA, and strongly reduces wildtype mRNA levels of the two long skn-1a/c variants. The skn-1(zj15) allele reduces detoxification gene expression and stress resistance to levels comparable to skn-1 RNAi, but, unlike RNAi, it is not restricted from some tissues. We also show that skn-1(zj15) is epistatic to canonical upstream regulators, demonstrating its utility for genetic analysis of skn-1 function and regulation in cases where large numbers of worms are needed, a balancer is problematic, diet is varied, or RNAi cannot be used. 
To determine the effects of a diet containing fish oil (FD) during pregnancy and lactation in rats on the metabolic adaptations made by the offspring during early extrauterine life and to compare it to an olive oil diet (OD).
Rats were mated and randomly allocated to OD or FD containing 10 % of the corresponding oil. During lactation, litters were adjusted to eight pups per dam. Fetuses of 20 days and pups of 0, 1, 10, 20 and 30 days of age were studied.
Body weight and length were lower in pups of the FD group from birth. The diet, milk, pups' plasma and liver of FD group had higher proportions of n-3 LCPUFA, but the content of arachidonic acid (ARA) was lower. Plasma glucose was higher, but unesterified fatty acids, triacylglycerols (TAG), 3-hydroxybutyrate and liver TAG in 1-day-old pups were lower in the FD group, and differences in some of these variables were also found in pups up to 30 days old. Liver lipoprotein lipase activity and mRNA expression, and the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, acyl-CoA oxidase and 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl-CoA synthase increased more at birth in pups of the FD group, but the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and Δ6-desaturase mRNA was lower in the FD group.
Maternal intake of high n-3 LCPUFA retards postnatal development, which could be the result of impaired ARA synthesis, and affects hepatic metabolic adaptations to extrauterine life.
IGF-I/insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) coordinately stimulate osteoblast differentiation but the mechanisms by which they function have not been determined. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is induced during differentiation and AMPK knockout mice have reduced bone mass. IGF-I modulates AMPK in other cell types; therefore, these studies determined whether IGF-I/IGFBP-2 stimulate AMPK activation and the mechanism by which AMPK modulates differentiation. Calvarial osteoblasts and MC-3T3 cells expressed activated AMPK early in differentiation and AMPK inhibitors attenuated differentiation. However, expression of constitutively activated AMPK inhibited differentiation. To resolve this discrepancy we analyzed the time course of AMPK induction. AMPK activation was required early in differentiation (day 3-6) but down-regulation of AMPK after day 9 was also necessary. IGF-I/IGFBP-2 induced AMPK through their respective receptors and blocking-receptor activation blocked AMPK induction. To determine the mechanism by which AMPK functioned we analyzed components of the autophagosome. Activated AMPK stimulated ULK-1 S555 phosphorylation as well as beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light-chain phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3II) induction. Inhibition of AMPK attenuated these changes and direct inhibition of autophagy inhibited differentiation. Conversely, expression of activated AMPK was associated with persistence of these changes beyond day 9 and inhibited differentiation. Blocking AMPK activation after day 9 down-regulated these autophagosome components and rescued differentiation. This allowed induction of mechanistic target of rapamycin and AKT, which suppressed autophagy. The results show that early induction of AMPK in response to IGF-I/IGFBP-2 followed by suppression is required for osteoblast differentiation. AMPK functions through stimulation of autophagy. The findings suggest that these early catabolic changes are important for determining the energy source for osteoblast respiration and down-regulation of these components may be required for induction of glycolysis, which is required during the final anabolic stages of differentiation. 
The L protein of mononegaviruses harbours all catalytic activities for genome replication and transcription. It contains six conserved domains (CR-I to -VI; Fig. 1a). CR-III has been linked to polymerase and polyadenylation activity, CR-V to mRNA capping and CR-VI to cap methylation. However, how these activities are choreographed is poorly understood. Here we present the 2.2-Å X-ray structure and activities of CR-VI+, a portion of human Metapneumovirus L consisting of CR-VI and the poorly conserved region at its C terminus, the +domain. The CR-VI domain has a methyltransferase fold, which besides the typical S-adenosylmethionine-binding site ((SAM)P) also contains a novel pocket ((NS)P) that can accommodate a nucleoside. CR-VI lacks an obvious cap-binding site, and the (SAM)P-adjoining site holding the nucleotides undergoing methylation ((SUB)P) is unusually narrow because of the overhanging +domain. CR-VI+ sequentially methylates caps at their 2'O and N7 positions, and also displays nucleotide triphosphatase activity. 
Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II is essential for autophagosome formation and is widely used to monitor autophagic activity. We show that CGK733 induces LC3 II and LC3-puncta accumulation, which are not involved in the activation of autophagy. The treatment of CGK733 did not alter the autophagic flux and was unrelated to p62 degradation. Treatment with CGK733 activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase/CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (PERK/CHOP) pathways and elevated the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1. Inhibition of both AMPK and PERK/CHOP pathways by siRNA or chemical inhibitor could block CGK733-induced p21Waf1/Cip1 expression as well as caspase-3 cleavage. Knockdown of LC3 B (but not LC3 A) abolished CGK733-triggered LC3 II accumulation and consequently diminished AMPK and PERK/CHOP activity as well as p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. Our results demonstrate that CGK733-triggered LC3 II formation is an initial event upstream of the AMPK and PERK/CHOP pathways, both of which control p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. 
Copy number variations (CNV) in CEBPA locus represent heterogeneous group of mutations accompanying acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this study was to characterize different CEBPA mutation categories in regard to biological data like age, cytology, CD7, and molecular markers, and identify possible factors affecting their etiology. We report here the incidence of 12.6% of CEBPA mutants in the population of 262 normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) patients. We confirmed that double mutant AMLs presented uniform biological features when compared to single CEBPA mutations and accompanied mostly younger patients. We hypothesized that pathogenesis of distinct CEBPA mutation categories might be influenced by different factors. The detailed sequence analysis revealed frequent breakpoint-associated microhomologies of 2 to 12bp. The analysis of distribution of microhomology motifs along CEBPA gene showed that longer stretches of microhomology at the mutational junctions were relatively rare by chance which suggests their functional role in the CEBPA mutagenesis. Additionally, accurate quantification of CEBPA transcript levels showed that double CEBPA mutations correlated with high-level CEBPA expression, whereas single N-terminal CEBPA mutations were associated with low-level CEBPA expression. This might suggest that high-level CEBPA expression and/or accessibility of CEBPA locus contribute to B-ZIP in-frame duplications. 
Malaria is highly endemic in Yunnan Province, China, with the incidence of malaria being highest along the Sino-Burmese border. The aim of our study was to determine whether genetic polymorphisms are associated with the prevalence of malaria among Chinese residents of the Sino-Burmese border region. Fourteen otherwise healthy people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, 50 malaria patients, and 67 healthy control subjects were included in our cross-sectional study. We analyzed the frequency of the G3093T and T520C single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CR1. Logistic regression was used to calculate the prevalence odds ratio (POR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of malaria for the T520C SNP of CR1 and SNPs of G6PD, IL-4, IL-4R, IL-1A, NOS, CD40LG, TNF, and LUC7L. The frequency of the 3093T/3093T genotype of CR1 in the malaria group (0.16) was significantly higher than that in the control group (0.045, P &lt; 0.05), and significantly lower than that in the G6PD deficiency group (0.43, P &lt; 0.01). The frequency of the 520T/520T genotype of CR1 was significantly higher in the malaria patients (0.78) than that in the control group (0.67, P &lt; 0.05) and G6PD-deficiency group (0.36, P &lt; 0.05). The T allele of the T520C variant of CR1 was significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria (POR: 1.460; 95% CI: 0.703-3.034). Polymorphisms of G6PD did not significantly influence the prevalence malaria (P &gt; 0.05). A GTGTGTC haplotype consisting of IL-1A (rs17561), IL-4 (rs2243250), TNF (rs1800750), IL-4R (rs1805015), NOS (rs8078340), CD40LG (rs1126535), and LUC7L (rs1211375) was significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria (POR: 1.822, 95% CI: 0.998-3.324). The 3093G/3093G and 520T/520T genotypes are the predominant genetic variants of CR1 among Chinese residents near the Sino-Burmese border, and the T allele of T520C is associated with the prevalence of malaria in this region. Although G6PD deficiency does not protect against malaria, it may diminish the association between malaria and the CR1 polymorphisms in this population. The GTGTGTC haplotype is also associated with the prevalence of malaria in this region.
The aim of the current study was to implement whole transcriptome massively parallel sequencing (RNASeq) and copy number analysis to investigate the molecular biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Samples from 16 patients with PDAC were collected by ultrasound‑guided biopsy or from surgical specimens for DNA and RNA extraction. All samples were analyzed by RNASeq performed at 75x2 base pairs on a HiScanSQ Illumina platform. Single‑nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected with SNVMix and filtered on dbSNP, 1000 Genomes and Cosmic. Non‑synonymous SNVs were analyzed with SNPs&amp;GO and PROVEAN. A total of 13 samples were analyzed by high resolution copy number analysis on an Affymetrix SNP array 6.0. RNAseq resulted in an average of 264 coding non‑synonymous novel SNVs (ranging from 146‑374) and 16 novel insertions or deletions (In/Dels) (ranging from 6‑24) for each sample, of which a mean of 11.2% were disease‑associated and somatic events, while 34.7% were frameshift somatic In/Dels. From this analysis, alterations in the known oncogenes associated with PDAC were observed, including Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations (93.7%) and inactivation of cyclin‑dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (50%), mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) (50%), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) (56%). One case that was negative for KRAS exhibited a G13D neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog mutation. In addition, gene fusions were detected in 10 samples for a total of 23 different intra‑ or inter‑chromosomal rearrangements, however, a recurrent fusion transcript remains to be identified. SNP arrays identified macroscopic and cryptic cytogenetic alterations in 85% of patients. Gains were observed in the chromosome arms 6p, 12p, 18q and 19q which contain KRAS, GATA binding protein 6, protein kinase B and cyclin D3. Deletions were identified on chromosome arms 1p, 9p, 6p, 18q, 10q, 15q, 17p, 21q and 19q which involve TP53, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, runt‑related transcription factor 2, AT‑rich interactive domain‑containing protein 1A, phosphatase and tensin homolog and serine/threonine kinase 11. In conclusion, genetic alterations in PDCA were observed to involve numerous pathways including cell migration, transforming growth factor‑β signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and DNA damage repair. However, signaling alterations were not observed in all tumors and key mutations appeared to differ between PDAC cases.
Several patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) with multiple imprinting defects found by genetic analysis have been described. However, only two cases have been described with both genetic and clinical signs and symptoms of multiple diseases caused by imprinting defects.
The girl in this case presented at the age of 6 months with morbid obesity (body mass index, +7.5 SDS) and a large umbilical hernia. Genetic analysis showed BWS (hypomethylation of the KCNQ1OT1 gene). Calcium homeostasis was normal, and she had no signs of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. At the age of 10 years, she presented with fatigue, and laboratory analyses showed marked hypocalcemia with signs of PTH resistance, but without evidence for Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, thus suggesting pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B. Consistent with this diagnosis, methylation analysis of the GNAS complex revealed hypomethylation (about 20%) of the GNAS exon 1A, NESPAS, and GNASXL loci and hypermethylation (100% methylation) of the NESP locus.
Imprinting defects at several different loci can occur in some patients, thus causing multiple different diseases. Symptoms of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B may be absent at diagnosis of BWS, yet prolonged subclinical hypocalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia can have negative consequences (eg, intracerebral calcifications, myocardial dysfunction). We therefore suggest that patients with an imprinting disorder should be monitored for elevations in PTH, and epigenetic analysis of the GNAS complex locus should be considered.
During eukaryotic translation initiation, 43S complexes, comprising a 40S ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1 and 1A, attach to the 5'-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9 signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at ∼6 Å resolution. It reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits. The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are discussed. 
Many solute carrier 6 (SLC6) family transporters require ancillary subunits to modify their expression and activity. The main apical membrane neutral amino acid transporters in mouse intestine and kidney, B(0)AT1 and B(0)AT3, require the ancillary protein collectrin or ACE2 for plasma membrane expression. Expression and activity of SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters are modulated by interaction with syntaxin 1A. Utilizing monocarboxylate-B(0)AT1/3 fusion constructs, we discovered that collectrin is also necessary for B(0)AT1 and B(0)AT3 catalytic function. Syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 3 inhibit the membrane expression of B(0)AT1 by competing with collectrin for access. A mutagenesis screening approach identified residues on trans-membrane domains 1α, 5, and 7 on one face of B(0)AT3 as a key region involved in interaction with collectrin. Mutant analysis established residues that were involved in collectrin-dependent functions as follows: plasma membrane expression of B(0)AT3, catalytic activation, or both. These results identify a potential binding site for collectrin and other SLC6 ancillary proteins. 
Diabetic patients have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of death in developed countries. Although multivitamin products are widely used as dietary supplements, the effects of these products have not been investigated in the diabetic heart yet. Therefore, here we investigated if a preparation of different minerals, vitamins, and trace elements (MVT) affects the cardiac gene expression pattern in experimental diabetes.
Two-day old male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin (i.p. 100 mg/kg) or citrate buffer to induce diabetes. From weeks 4 to 12, rats were fed with a vehicle or a MVT preparation. Fasting blood glucose measurement and oral glucose tolerance test were performed at week 12, and then total RNA was isolated from the myocardium and assayed by rat oligonucleotide microarray for 41012 oligonucleotides.
Significantly elevated fasting blood glucose concentration and impaired glucose tolerance were markedly improved by MVT-treatment in diabetic rats at week 12. Genes with significantly altered expression due to diabetes include functional clusters related to cardiac hypertrophy (e.g. caspase recruitment domain family, member 9; cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide; FXYD domain containing ion transport regulator 3), stress response (e.g. metallothionein 1a; metallothionein 2a; interleukin-6 receptor; heme oxygenase (decycling) 1; and glutathione S-transferase, theta 3), and hormones associated with insulin resistance (e.g. resistin; FK506 binding protein 5; galanin/GMAP prepropeptide). Moreover the expression of some other genes with no definite cardiac function was also changed such as e.g. similar to apolipoprotein L2; brain expressed X-linked 1; prostaglandin b2 synthase (brain). MVT-treatment in diabetic rats showed opposite gene expression changes in the cases of 19 genes associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. In healthy hearts, MVT-treatment resulted in cardiac gene expression changes mostly related to immune response (e.g. complement factor B; complement component 4a; interferon regulatory factor 7; hepcidin).
MVT-treatment improved diagnostic markers of diabetes. This is the first demonstration that MVT-treatment significantly alters cardiac gene expression profile in both control and diabetic rats. Our results and further studies exploring the mechanistic role of individual genes may contribute to the prevention or diagnosis of cardiac complications in diabetes.
Rearrangement of membrane structure induced by dengue virus (DENV) is essential for replication, and requires host cellular machinery. Adaptor protein complex (AP)-1 is a host component, which can be recruited to components required for membrane rearrangement. Therefore, dysfunction of AP-1 may affect membrane organization, thereby decreasing replication of virus in infected cells. In the present study, AP-1-dependent traffic inhibitor inhibited DENV protein expression and virion production. We further clarified the role of AP-1A in the life cycle of DENV by RNA interference. AP-1A was not involved in DENV entry into cells. However, it facilitated DENV RNA replication. Viral RNA level was reduced significantly in Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A small interfering RNA (siRNA) compared with control siRNA. Transfection of naked DENV viral RNA into Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A siRNA resulted in less viral RNA and virion production than transfection into Huh7 cells transfected with control siRNA. Huh7 cells transfected with AP-1A siRNA showed greater modification of membrane structures and fewer vesicular packets compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. Therefore, AP-1A may partly control DENV-induced rearrangement of membrane structures required for viral replication. 
MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and miRNA-guided RNA interference (RNAi) are essential for gene expression in eukaryotes. Here we report that translation initiation factor eIF1A directly interacts with Ago2 and promotes Ago2 activities in RNAi and miR-451 biogenesis. Biochemical and NMR analyses demonstrate that eIF1A binds to the MID domain of Ago2 and this interaction does not impair translation initiation. Alanine mutation of the Ago2-facing Lys56 in eIF1A impairs RNAi activities in human cells and zebrafish. The eIF1A-Ago2 assembly facilitates Dicer-independent biogenesis of miR-451, which mediates erythrocyte maturation. Human eIF1A (heIF1A), but not heIF1A(K56A), rescues the erythrocyte maturation delay in eif1axb knockdown zebrafish. Consistently, miR-451 partly compensates erythrocyte maturation defects in zebrafish with eif1axb knockdown and eIF1A(K56A) expression, supporting a role of eIF1A in miRNA-451 biogenesis in this model. Our results suggest that eIF1A is a novel component of the Ago2-centred RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) and augments Ago2-dependent RNAi and miRNA biogenesis. 
The present study was conducted to investigate the effects and mechanisms of hypothyroidism, induced by administration of 0.2% methimazole through the food, on lipid metabolism in the liver of juvenile yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. To this end, yellow catfish were fed diets containing either 0 or 2g methimazole per kg of diet for 8weeks, respectively. The results showed that fish fed diet containing methimazole had a significant reduction in growth performance, plasma THs levels and hepatic lipid content. Meanwhile, methimazole treatment inhibited the activities of lipogenic enzymes (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthase) and the mRNA levels of genes involved in lipogenesis (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, sterol-regulator element-binding protein-1 and liver X receptor), but increased lipolytic enzyme (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) activity and the expression of genes involved in lipolysis (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, hormone-sensitive lipase and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α). Thus, our study indicated that dietary methimazole-induced hypothyroidism could disturb the normal processes of lipid metabolism at the enzymatic and molecular levels in yellow catfish, and the reduced hepatic lipid content by hypothyroidism was attributable to the down-regulation of lipogenesis and up-regulation of lipolysis. 
Uveal melanoma is genetically one of the simplest malignant tumors in adults. Initiation of these tumors is dependent of an oncogenic mutation in the GNAQ or GNA11 genes present in almost all cases. The nature of second mutational events is of major interest as it monosomy 3, gain of 8q and BAP1 inactivation are associated with unfavorable prognosis while SF3BI or EIF1AX are of good prognosis. Despite their common lineage, cutaneous and uveal melanomas are distinct diseases, implicating different oncogenic pathways and contrasting mutational landscapes. Even if uveal melanoma is a simple tumor, it is also one of the deadliest tumors in adults. There is a major clinical need for drugs targeting either the downstream pathways of Gαq and Gα11 or the biological cell functions dysregulated by BAP1 loss of function. 
Differentiated tissue is particularly vulnerable to alterations in protein and organelle homeostasis. The essential protein VCP, mutated in hereditary inclusion body myopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, is critical for efficient clearance of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles in dividing cells, but its role in terminally differentiated tissue affected by disease mutations is less clear. To understand the relevance of VCP in differentiated tissue, we inactivated it in skeletal muscle of adult mice. Surprisingly, knockout muscle demonstrated a necrotic myopathy with increased macroautophagic/autophagic proteins and damaged lysosomes. This was not solely due to a defect in autophagic degradation because age-matched mice with muscle inactivation of the autophagy essential protein, ATG5, did not demonstrate a myopathy. Notably, myofiber necrosis was preceded by upregulation of LGALS3/Galectin-3, a marker of damaged lysosomes, and TFEB activation, suggesting early defects in the lysosomal system. Consistent with that, myofiber necrosis was recapitulated by chemical induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in skeletal muscle. Moreover, TFEB was activated after LMP in cells, but activation and nuclear localization of TFEB persisted upon VCP inactivation or disease mutant expression. Our data identifies VCP as central mediator of both lysosomal clearance and biogenesis in skeletal muscle.

Ocular melanoma is a rare but often deadly malignancy that arises in the uvea (commonest primary site), conjunctiva or the orbit. Primary orbital melanoma (POM) is exceedingly rare, with approximately 60 cases reported to date. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of primary uveal and conjunctival melanomas, this information is lacking for POM.
DNA was extracted from 12 POM tissues, with matched germline DNA (where available). MLPA was conducted to detect chromosomal alterations and Sanger sequencing used to identify point mutations in candidate melanoma driver genes (BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, GNA11, GNAQ), and other genes implicated in melanoma prognosis (EIF1AX, SF3B1). Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyse BAP1 nuclear expression.
MLPA detected copy number alterations in chromosomes 1p, 3, 6 and 8. Sequencing of melanoma driver genes revealed GNAQ (p.Q209L) mutations in two samples; although it is possible that these samples represent extraocular spread of an occult uveal melanoma. A recurrent mutation in SF3B1 (p.R625H) was observed in indolent, but not aggressive, tumours; a mutation in EIF1AX (p.N4S) was detected in one patient with non-aggressive disease.
EIF1AX and SF3B1 mutations appear have a role in determining the clinical course of POM and detection of these changes could have clinical significance. Further in depth analysis of this rare group using differing 'omic technologies will provide novel insights into tumour pathogenesis.
Dairy cows with ketosis are characterized by high blood concentrations of ketone bodies and hepatic lipid metabolism disorder. The discrepancies in the abundance of mRNA encoding a variety of hepatic candidate genes in varying degrees of ketotic cows represent specific responses of the liver to the challenge of fatty acids and ketone bodies. Importantly, the expression disorder of hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism plays a promoting role in the onset and progression of ketosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of genes involved in the hepatic fatty acids uptake, transport, activation, β-oxidation, synthesis, and esterification in the cows with subclinical ketosis (SCK) or clinical ketosis (CK). Twenty-four cows were selected into control [n = 8, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ≤0.6 mM], SCK (n = 8, 3.0 &gt; BHB ≥ 1.2 mM), and CK (n = 8, BHB ≥3.0 mM) groups according to the blood BHB concentration and clinical symptoms. The accumulation of hepatic lipid, as indicated by triglycerides (TG) contents and Oil Red O and hematoxylin and eosin staining, was pronouncedly exacerbated in the tCK group compared with the control and SCK groups. The hepatic mRNA expression of fatty acids transport and activation genes, liver fatty acid-binding protein (FABP1) and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1), were both significantly higher in the SCK and CK groups than in the control group. The expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARA) and its target genes, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), were significantly elevated in the SCK group but reduced in the CK group compared with control group. Furthermore, the gene expression level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the protein expression level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and its target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) and TG synthesis genes diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were significantly higher in the CK group relative to the control group. In short, the present data indicated that hepatic fatty acids uptake, transport, and activation are significantly increased in cows with SCK and CK, hepatic fatty acids β-oxidation is significantly increased in SCK cows but markedly decreased in CK cows, and hepatic fatty acids and TG synthesis are significantly increased in CK cows, thereby inducing hepatic steatosis in CK cows.
To decrease errors and increase accuracy and reliability of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results, the use of a reference gene is inevitable. Despite the industrial importance of genus Thymus, not any validated reference gene has not been reported for T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris which could limit such investigations. In this study, the expression stability of seven housekeeping genes including Actin, Cyclophilin-18, elongation factor-1A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S ribosomal RNA, Cullin, and Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein were evaluated in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris which grown at four levels of drought stress using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Histone deacetylase-6 (HDA-6) gene was also used for validation of evaluated reference genes. In T. vulgaris, all of the algorithms similarly ranked elongation factor-1A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the two most stably expressed genes. In T. kotschyanus, only NormFinder and BestKeeper had a similar ranking and identified Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the two most stably expressed genes, but geNorm algorithm ranked elongation factor-1A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the best two reference genes. On the other hand, all algorithms ranked 18S rRNA and Cyclophilin-18 as the least stable genes in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris, respectively. Validation results indicated that there was a significant change (0.53-3.19 fold change) in relative expression of HDA-6 normalized by the best stable gene compare to the least ranked gene. Our study presented the first systematic validation of reference gene(s) selection in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris and provided useful information to obtain more accurate qRT-PCR results in these species.
Under fasting conditions, activation of several hepatic genes sets the stage for gluconeogenesis in the liver. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) are essential for this transcriptional induction of gluconeogenic genes. PGC-1α induction is mediated by activation of a CREB/CRTC2 signaling complex, and recent findings have revealed that small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE), a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, is an insulin-inducible corepressor that decreases PGC-1α expression and abrogates its stimulatory effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism whereby SMILE suppresses PGC-1α expression is unknown. Here, we investigated SMILE's effects on the CREB/CRTC2 signaling pathway and glucose metabolism. We found that SMILE significantly inhibits CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression by interacting with and disrupting the CREB/CRTC2 complex. Consequently, SMILE decreased PGC-1α-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore, SMILE inhibited CREB/CRTC2-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) gene expression by directly repressing the expression of these genes and by indirectly inhibiting the expression of PGC-1α via CREB/CRTC2 repression. Indeed, enhanced gluconeogenesis and circulating blood glucose levels in mice injected with an adenovirus construct containing a constitutively active CRTC2 variant (CRTC2-S171A) were significantly reduced by WT SMILE, but not by leucine zipper-mutated SMILE. These results reveal that SMILE represses CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression, an insight that may help inform potential therapeutic approaches targeting PGC-1α-mediated regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism.
A series of 2-Cl-benzimidazole derivatives was synthesized and assessed for antibacterial activity. Antibacterial results indicated that compounds 2d, 2e, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4d and 4e showed promising activity against B. cerus, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (MIC: 6.2 μg/mL) and excellent efficacy against E. coli (MIC: 3.1 μg/mL). Furthermore, compounds 3d and 3e displayed better activity (MIC: 3.1 μg/mL) than the reference drugs chloramphenicol and cycloheximide against gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains. The compounds 3d-e also showed better activity than the reference drug paromomycin against B. cerus and P. aeruginosa and showed similar inhibition pattern against S. aureus and E. coli. (MIC: 3.1 μg/mL). Studies on fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) determination of compounds 1a-e, 2a-c, 4a-c and the reference antibiotic via combination approach revealed a synergistic effect as the MIC values were lowered up to 1/8th to 1/33rd of the original MIC. In-vitro cytotoxicity study indicated that 2-Cl-benzimidazole derivatives showed less toxicity than the reference used against PBM, CEM and Vero cell lines. Docking studies and MD simulations of compounds on bacterial protein (eubacterial ribosomal decoding A site, PDB: 1j7t) have been conducted to find the possible mode of action of the molecules. In silico ADMET evaluations of compounds 3d and 3e showed promising results comparable to the reference drugs used in this study.
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in the Western world. Recurrent mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, PLCB4, BAP1, EIF1AX, and SF3B1 are described as well as non-random chromosomal aberrations. Chromothripsis is a rare event in which chromosomes are shattered and rearranged and has been reported in a variety of cancers including UM. SNP arrays of 249 UM from patients who underwent enucleation, biopsy or endoresection were reviewed for the presence of chromothripsis. Chromothripsis was defined as ten or more breakpoints per chromosome involved. Genetic analysis of GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX was conducted using Sanger and next-generation sequencing. In addition, immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed. Chromothripsis was detected in 7 out of 249 tumors and the affected chromosomes were chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 13. The mean total of fragments per chromosome was 39.8 (range 12-116). In 1 UM, chromothripsis was present in 2 different chromosomes. GNAQ, GNA11 or CYSLTR2 mutations were present in 6 of these tumors and 5 tumors harbored a BAP1 mutation and/or lacked BAP1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Four of these tumors metastasized and for the fifth only short follow-up data are available. One of these metastatic tumors harbored an SF3B1 mutation. No EIF1AX mutations were detected in any of the tumors. To conclude, chromothripsis is a rare event in UM, occurring in 2.8% of samples and without significant association with mutations in any of the common UM driver genes.
The purpose of the current study is to assess changes in the expression of Acid-Sensing Ion Channel (ASIC)1a and ASIC2 in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after retinal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury and to test if inhibition of ASIC1a provides RGC neuroprotection.
Transient ischemia was induced in one eye of C57BL/6 mice by raising intraocular pressure to 120 mmHg for 60 min followed by retinal reperfusion by restoring normal pressure. RGC function was measured by Pattern electroretinography (PERG). In addition, retinal ASIC1a and ASIC2 were observed by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Changes in calpain, fodrin, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Brn3a, super oxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), catalase, and glutathione perioxidase-4 (GPX4) protein levels were assessed by western blot. RGC numbers were measured by immunohistochemistry on whole retinal flat mounts using anti-RNA binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) antibodies. Intravitreal injection of psalmotoxin-1, a selective ASIC1a blocker, was used to assess the neuroprotective effect of ASIC1a inhibition.
Levels of ASIC1a and ASIC2 after I/R increased in RGCs. Upregulation of ASIC1a but not ASIC2 was attenuated by intravitreal injection of psalmotoxin-1. I/R induced activation of calpain and degradation of fodrin, HSP70, and reduction in Brn3a. In contrast, while psalmotoxin-1 attenuated calpain activation and increased Brn3a levels, it failed to block HSP70 degradation. Unlike SOD1 protein which was reduced, catalase protein levels increased after I/R. Psalmotoxin-1, although not affecting SOD1 and GPX4, increased catalase levels significantly. Psalmotoxin-1 also increased RBPMS-labeled RGCs following I/R as judged by immunohistochemistry of retinal flat mounts. Finally, psalmotoxin-1 enhanced the amplitude of PERG following I/R, suggesting partial rescue of RGC function.
Psalmotoxin-1 appears to exert a neuroprotective effect under ischemic insults and targeting inhibition of ASICs may represent a new therapeutic approach in ischemic retinal diseases.
Infection by most DNA viruses activates a cellular DNA damage response (DDR), which may be to the detriment or advantage of the virus. In the case of adenoviruses, they neutralize antiviral effects of DDR activation by targeting a number of proteins for rapid proteasome-mediated degradation. We have now identified a novel DDR protein, tankyrase 1 binding protein 1 (TNKS1BP1) (also known as Tab182), which is degraded during infection by adenovirus serotype 5 and adenovirus serotype 12. In both cases, degradation requires the action of the early region 1B55K (E1B55K) and early region 4 open reading frame 6 (E4orf6) viral proteins and is mediated through the proteasome by the action of cullin-based cellular E3 ligases. The degradation of Tab182 appears to be serotype specific, as the protein remains relatively stable following infection with adenovirus serotypes 4, 7, 9, and 11. We have gone on to confirm that Tab182 is an integral component of the CNOT complex, which has transcriptional regulatory, deadenylation, and E3 ligase activities. The levels of at least 2 other members of the complex (CNOT3 and CNOT7) are also reduced during adenovirus infection, whereas the levels of CNOT4 and CNOT1 remain stable. The depletion of Tab182 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhances the expression of early region 1A proteins (E1As) to a limited extent during adenovirus infection, but the depletion of CNOT1 is particularly advantageous to the virus and results in a marked increase in the expression of adenovirus early proteins. In addition, the depletion of Tab182 and CNOT1 results in a limited increase in the viral DNA level during infection. We conclude that the cellular CNOT complex is a previously unidentified major target for adenoviruses during infection.IMPORTANCE Adenoviruses target a number of cellular proteins involved in the DNA damage response for rapid degradation. We have now shown that Tab182, which we have confirmed to be an integral component of the mammalian CNOT complex, is degraded following infection by adenovirus serotypes 5 and 12. This requires the viral E1B55K and E4orf6 proteins and is mediated by cullin-based E3 ligases and the proteasome. In addition to Tab182, the levels of other CNOT proteins are also reduced during adenovirus infection. Thus, CNOT3 and CNOT7, for example, are degraded, whereas CNOT4 and CNOT1 are not. The siRNA-mediated depletion of components of the complex enhances the expression of adenovirus early proteins and increases the concentration of viral DNA produced during infection. This study highlights a novel protein complex, CNOT, which is targeted for adenovirus-mediated protein degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the CNOT complex has been identified as an adenoviral target.
The TET2 gene encodes an α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase able to oxidize 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which is a step toward active DNA demethylation. TET2 is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies but also in B- and T-cell malignancies. TET2 somatic mutations are also identified in healthy elderly individuals with clonal hematopoiesis. Tet2-deficient mouse models showed widespread hematological differentiation abnormalities, including myeloid, T-cell, and B-cell malignancies. We show here that, similar to what is observed with constitutive Tet2-deficient mice, B-cell-specific Tet2 knockout leads to abnormalities in the B1-cell subset and a development of B-cell malignancies after long latency. Aging Tet2-deficient mice accumulate clonal CD19+ B220low immunoglobulin M+ B-cell populations with transplantable ability showing similarities to human chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including CD5 expression and sensitivity to ibrutinib-mediated B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibition. Exome sequencing of Tet2-/- malignant B cells reveals C-to-T and G-to-A mutations that lie within single-stranded DNA-specific activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC (apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases targeted motif, as confirmed by the lack of a B-cell tumor in compound Tet2-Aicda-deficient mice. Finally, we show that Tet2 deficiency accelerates and exacerbates T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1A-induced leukemogenesis. Together, our data establish that Tet2 deficiency predisposes to mature B-cell malignancies, which development might be attributed in part to AID-mediated accumulating mutations and BCR-mediated signaling.
L-Theanine is a nonprotein amino acid in tea, and its immunomodulatory function has been confirmed. This study aimed to investigate the effect of L-theanine addition on cytokines secretion in rat splenic lymphocytes and explore its potential immunomodulatory effects on the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. Our results showed that L-theanine treatment did not influence the proliferation and division indexes of the splenic lymphocytes subsets. Interestingly, L-theanine treatment had regulated the contents of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α  (P &lt; 0.001) except IL-6 and upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of Ras-related protein Rap-1A (Rap1A), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPs) (P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between Rap1A and HMGCR proteins expression and IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-6 levels. In conclusion, L-theanine regulated the secretion of cytokines probably by activating expression of Rap1A and HMGCR proteins involved in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway in rat splenic lymphocytes. Therefore, L-theanine might be a promising potential drug candidate as immunopotentiator.
Eukaryotic translation initiation is tightly regulated, requiring a set of conserved initiation factors (eIFs). Translation of a capped mRNA depends on the trimeric eIF4F complex and eIF4B to load the mRNA onto the 43S pre-initiation complex comprising 40S and initiation factors 1, 1A, 2, 3 and 5 as well as initiator-tRNA. Binding of the mRNA is followed by mRNA scanning in the 48S pre-initiation complex, until a start codon is recognised. Here, we use a reconstituted system to prepare human 48S complexes assembled on capped mRNA in the presence of eIF4B and eIF4F. The highly purified h-48S complexes are used for cross-linking/mass spectrometry, revealing the protein interaction network in this complex. We report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of the h-48S complex at 6.3 Å resolution. While the majority of eIF4B and eIF4F appear to be flexible with respect to the ribosome, additional density is detected at the entrance of the 40S mRNA channel which we attribute to the RNA-recognition motif of eIF4B. The eight core subunits of eIF3 are bound at the 40S solvent-exposed side, as well as the subunits eIF3d, eIF3b and eIF3i. elF2 and initiator-tRNA bound to the start codon are present at the 40S intersubunit side. This cryo-EM structure represents a molecular snap-shot revealing the h-48S complex following start codon recognition.
Excessive fructose ingestion drastically enhances hepatic lipid accumulation. The most prominent form of inositol-myo-inositol (MI)-remarkably reduces high sucrose-induced hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Because MI is a major and strong lipotrope, we hypothesized in this study that MI improves fatty liver more induced by excessive ingestion of fructose than sucrose. Rats were fed a high-glucose diet (HGD), a high-fructose diet (HFD), or an HFD supplemented with 0.2% MI for 12 days. Hepatic levels of TG and mRNAs for fructolysis (ketohexokinase and aldolase B), lipogenesis (pyruvate kinase, liver, and RBC; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha; fatty acid synthase; and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1), and a key transcription factor for lipogenesis-carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-were significantly increased in the HFD group compared with the HGD group, and the increase was markedly decreased by MI supplementation. Similarly, HFD-induced pyruvate kinase, liver, and RBC and fatty acid synthase protein levels in the liver were reduced by MI treatment. On the other hand, hepatic levels of mRNAs for β-oxidation (acyl-CoA synthetase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) did not differ among the 3 groups. Taken together, this study showed that MI supplementation decreases the expression of fructolytic/lipogenic genes and lipogenic proteins as well as TG accumulation in high fructose-induced fatty liver in rats.
The translation pre-initiation complex (PIC) scans the mRNA for an AUG codon in favorable context, and AUG recognition stabilizes a closed PIC conformation. The unstructured N-terminal tail (NTT) of yeast eIF1A deploys five basic residues to contact tRNAi, mRNA, or 18S rRNA exclusively in the closed state. Interestingly, EIF1AX mutations altering the human eIF1A NTT are associated with uveal melanoma (UM). We found that substituting all five basic residues, and seven UM-associated substitutions, in yeast eIF1A suppresses initiation at near-cognate UUG codons and AUGs in poor context. Ribosome profiling of NTT substitution R13P reveals heightened discrimination against unfavorable AUG context genome-wide. Both R13P and K16D substitutions destabilize the closed complex at UUG codons in reconstituted PICs. Thus, electrostatic interactions involving the eIF1A NTT stabilize the closed conformation and promote utilization of suboptimal start codons. We predict UM-associated mutations alter human gene expression by increasing discrimination against poor initiation sites.
Protein phosphatase inhibitors are often considered as tumor promoters. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1A (PPP1R1A) is a potent protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor; however, its role in tumor development is largely undefined. Here we characterize, for the first time, the functions of PPP1R1A in Ewing sarcoma (ES) pathogenesis. We found that PPP1R1A is one of the top ranked target genes of EWS/FLI, the master regulator of ES, and is upregulated by EWS/FLI via a GGAA microsatellite enhancer element. Depletion of PPP1R1A resulted in a significant decrease in oncogenic transformation and cell migration in vitro as well as xenograft tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. RNA-sequencing and functional annotation analyses revealed that PPP1R1A regulates genes associated with various cellular functions including cell junction, adhesion and neurogenesis. Interestingly, we found a significant overlap of PPP1R1A-regulated gene set with that of ZEB2 and EWS, which regulates metastasis and neuronal differentiation in ES, respectively. Further studies for characterization of the molecular mechanisms revealed that activation of PPP1R1A by PKA phosphorylation at Thr35, and subsequent PP1 binding and inhibition, was required for PPP1R1A-mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis, likely by increasing the phosphorylation levels of various PP1 substrates. Furthermore, we found that a PKA inhibitor impaired ES cell proliferation, tumor growth and metastasis, which was rescued by the constitutively active PPP1R1A. Together, these results offered new insights into the role and mechanism of PPP1R1A in tumor development and identified an important kinase and phosphatase pathway, PKA/PPP1R1A/PP1, in ES pathogenesis. Our findings strongly suggest a potential therapeutic value of inhibition of the PKA/PPP1R1A/PP1 pathway in the treatment of primary and metastatic ES.
Macrophages possess the hallmark feature of plasticity, allowing them to undergo a dynamic transition between M1 and M2 polarized phenotypes. The aim of the present study was to screen for differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) that were associated with BALB/c murine macrophage polarization. The transcription profiles of three M1 and three M2 samples were obtained using microarray analysis. Based on the threshold of fold‑change &gt;2.0 and P‑value &lt;0.05, a total of 1,253 DEGs were identified, of which 696 were upregulated and 557 downregulated in M1 macrophages compared with M2 macrophages. Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. A gene‑gene interaction network of the DEGs was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. GO annotation identified three categories: Cellular component, molecular function and biological process, with 34 and 40 enrichment terms consisting of upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively. GO enrichment analysis of DEGs was primarily associated with protein binding, response to stimulus, cell differentiation, and regulation of biological process. KEGG enrichment identified 15 and four pathways involving upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively. Signaling pathway analysis revealed that these DEGs were mainly involved in apoptosis, hypoxia‑inducible factor (HIF) 1a pathway, innate immune system, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction, and other signal transduction pathways. Interaction network analysis indicated that genes including TNF, interleukin (IL)‑6, IL‑1β, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, nitric oxide synthase 2, HIF1a may serve key roles in macrophage polarization. The present study provided new insights into the role of genes in macrophage differentiation and polarization.
Molecular characterization of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) may provide a biologic rationale for treatment response and novel therapeutic strategies.
To identify genetic alterations with potential clinical implications in NMIBC.
Pretreatment index tumors and matched germline DNA from 105 patients with NMIBC on a prospective Institutional Review Board-approved protocol underwent targeted exon sequencing analysis in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified clinical laboratory.
Comutation patterns and copy number alterations were compared across stage and grade. Associations between genomic alterations and recurrence after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
TERT promoter mutations (73%) and chromatin-modifying gene alterations (69%) were highly prevalent across grade and stage, suggesting these events occur early in tumorigenesis. ERBB2 or FGFR3 alterations were present in 57% of high-grade NMIBC tumors in a mutually exclusive pattern. DNA damage repair (DDR) gene alterations were seen in 30% (25/82) of high-grade NMIBC tumors, a rate similar to MIBC, and were associated with a higher mutational burden compared with tumors with intact DDR genes (p&lt;0.001). ARID1A mutations were associated with an increased risk of recurrence after BCG (hazard ratio=3.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.51-6.51, p=0.002).
Next-generation sequencing of treatment-naive index NMIBC tumors demonstrated that the majority of NMIBC tumors had at least one potentially actionable alteration that could serve as a target in rationally designed trials of intravesical or systemic therapy. DDR gene alterations were frequent in high-grade NMIBC and were associated with increased mutational load, which may have therapeutic implications for BCG immunotherapy and ongoing trials of systemic checkpoint inhibitors. ARID1A mutations were associated with an increased risk of recurrence after BCG therapy. Whether ARID1A mutations represent a predictive biomarker of BCG response or are prognostic in NMIBC patients warrants further investigation.
Analysis of frequently mutated genes in superficial bladder cancer suggests potential targets for personalized treatment and predictors of treatment response, and also may help develop noninvasive tumor detection tests.
Interferon-β 1a (IFN-β 1a) is a common strategy therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) with unknown mechanisms. S100A12 (S100 calcium-binding protein A12) is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule which binds to its receptor, RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products), and activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). NF-κB is transcribed from proinflammatory molecules, which may participate in the pathogenesis of MS. Therefore, the aims of this study were to compare mRNA levels of S100A12, RAGE, and NF-κB in newly diagnosed MS patients with healthy controls and determine whether IFN-β 1a therapy affects the expression of the molecules.
S100A12, RAGE, and NF-κB mRNA levels in 30 new cases of untreated MS patients and 35 healthy controls were evaluated using the real-time PCR technique. The mRNA levels were also evaluated in the MS patients after 6 months of IFN-β 1a therapy.
S100A12, RAGE, and NF-κB mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the new cases of untreated MS patients in comparison to healthy controls. IFN-β 1a therapy results in upregulation of RAGE in MS patients, but not S100A12 and NF-κB.
It appears that S100A12 participates in the pathogenesis of MS, and it seems that IFN-β 1a modulates immune responses in an S100A12-independent manner. Based on the reported anti-inflammatory effects of RAGE, it seems that RAGE may be considered as a mechanism by IFN-β 1a to modulate immune responses. NF-κB is produced permanently in the human cells and is inactive in the cytoplasm; therefore, the effects of IFN-β 1a may be related to its functions rather than expressions.
Biopsies from patients with high-risk (HR) non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (NMIUC), especially flat urothelial carcinoma in situ, frequently contain scant diagnostic material or denuded mucosa only, and this precludes further extensive genomic analysis. This study evaluated the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of urine cytology material from patients with HR NMIUC in an attempt to identify genetic alterations that might correlate with clinical features and responses to bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment.
Forty-one cytology slides from patients with HR NMIUC treated with intravesical BCG were selected for this study. Histological confirmation was available for all cases. The specimens were subjected to NGS analysis with a customized targeted exome capture assay composed of 341 genes.
In this cohort, genomic alterations were successfully identified in all cytology samples. Mutations were detected down to a 2% allele frequency and chromosomal rearrangements including copy number alterations and gene fusions were identified. The most frequently altered genes included telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), tumor protein 53 (TP53), Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), and chromatin remodeling genes such as lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A) and AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A). For patients with matched tumor tissue, cytology specimens revealed all mutations detected in tissue as well as additional mutations, and this suggested that urine might more effectively capture the full genetic heterogeneity of disease than an individual cystectomy. Alterations in multiple genes correlated with clinical and histopathological features, including responses to BCG treatment, flat architecture versus papillary architecture, and smoking history.

The Eurasian beaver is one of the largest rodents that, despite its high impact on the environment, is a non-model species that lacks a reference genome. Characterising genes critical for pregnancy outcome can serve as a basis for identifying mechanisms underlying effective reproduction, which is required for the success of endangered species conservation programs. In the present study, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyse global changes in the Castor fiber subplacenta transcriptome during multiple pregnancy. De novo reconstruction of the C. fiber subplacenta transcriptome was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in placentas (n=5) from two females (in advanced twin and triple pregnancy). Analyses of the expression values revealed 124 contigs with significantly different expression; of these, 55 genes were identified using MegaBLAST. Within this group of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 18 were upregulated and 37 were downregulated in twins. Most DEGs were associated with the following gene ontology terms: cellular process, single organism process, response to stimulus, metabolic process and biological regulation. Some genes were also assigned to the developmental process, the reproductive process or reproduction. Among this group, four genes (namely keratin 19 (Krt19) and wingless-type MMTV integration site family - member 2 (Wnt2), which were downregulated in twins, and Nik-related kinase (Nrk) and gap junction protein β2 (Gjb2), which were upregulated in twins) were assigned to placental development and nine (Krt19, Wnt2 and integrin α7 (Itga7), downregulated in twins, and Nrk, gap junction protein β6 (Gjb6), GATA binding protein 6 (Gata6), apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and haemoglobin subunit α1 (HbA1), upregulated in twins) were assigned to embryo development. The results of the present study indicate that the number of fetuses affects the expression profile in the C. fiber subplacental transcriptome. Enhancement of transcriptomic resources for C. fiber will improve understanding of the pathways relevant to proper placental development and successful reproduction.
Airway remodeling is resultant of a complex multicellular response associated with a progressive decline of pulmonary function in patients with chronic airway disease. Here, repeated infections with respiratory viruses are linked with airway remodeling through largely unknown mechanisms. Although acute activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 pathway by extracellular polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]) induces innate signaling through the NF-κB transcription factor in normal human small airway epithelial cells, prolonged (repetitive or tonic) poly(I:C) stimulation produces chronic stress fiber formation, mesenchymal transition, and activation of a fibrotic program. Chronic poly(I:C) stimulation enhanced the expression of core mesenchymal regulators Snail family zinc finger 1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox, mesenchymal intermediate filaments (vimentin), and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin-1), and collagen 1A. This mesenchymal transition was prevented by silencing expression of NF-κB/RelA or administration of a small-molecule inhibitor of the IκB kinase, BMS345541. Acute poly(I:C) exposure in vivo induced profound neutrophilic airway inflammation. When administered repetitively, poly(I:C) resulted in enhanced fibrosis observed by lung micro-computed tomography, second harmonic generation microscopy of optically cleared lung tissue, and by immunohistochemistry. Epithelial flattening, expansion of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, and enhanced Snail family zinc finger 1 and fibronectin 1 expression in airway epithelium were also observed. Repetitive poly(I:C)-induced airway remodeling, fibrosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition was inhibited by BMS345541 administration. Based on this novel model of viral inflammation-induced remodeling, we conclude that NF-κB is a major controller of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and pulmonary fibrosis, a finding that has potentially important relevance to airway remodeling produced by repetitive viral infections.
Injection drug users uninfected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) despite likely repeated exposure through high-risk behaviour are well documented. Factors preventing infection in these individuals are incompletely understood. Here, we looked for anti-HCV-envelope antibody responses in a cohort of repeatedly exposed but uninfected subjects. Forty-two hepatitis C diagnostic antibody- and RNA-negative injection drug users at high risk of exposure were studied and findings compared to healthy controls and cases with chronic HCV infection. Purified IgGs from sera were tested by ELISA for binding to genotype 1a and 3a envelope glycoproteins E1E2 with further testing for IgG and IgM reactivity against soluble E2. Virus-neutralizing activity was assessed using an HCV pseudoparticle system. Uninfected subjects demonstrated significantly greater IgG and IgM reactivities to envelope glycoproteins than healthy controls with IgG from 6 individuals additionally showing significant neutralization. This study is the first to describe humoral immunological responses targeting the HCV envelope, important for viral neutralization, in exposed uninfected individuals. A subset of these cases also had evidence of viral neutralization via anti-envelope antibodies. In addition to confirming viral exposure, the presence of specific anti-envelope antibodies may be a factor that helps these individuals resist HCV infection.
The current paradigm for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection involves combinations of agents that act directly on steps of the HCV life cycle. Here we report the preclinical characteristics of ITMN-8187, a nonmacrocyclic inhibitor of the NS3/4A HCV protease. X-ray crystallographic studies of ITMN-8187 and simeprevir binding to NS3/4A protease demonstrated good agreement between structures. Low nanomolar biochemical potency was maintained against NS3/4A derived from HCV genotypes 1, 2b, 4, 5, and 6. In cell-based potency assays, half-maximal reduction of genotype 1a and 1b HCV replicon RNA was afforded by 11 and 4 nM doses of ITMN-8187, respectively. Combinations of ITMN-8187 with other directly acting antiviral agents in vitro displayed additive antiviral efficacy. A 30-mg/kg of body weight dose of ITMN-8187 administered for 4 days yielded significant viral load reductions through day 5 in a chimeric mouse model of HCV. A 3-mg/kg oral dose administered to rats, dogs, or monkeys yielded concentrations in plasma 16 h after dosing that exceeded the half-maximal effective concentration of ITMN-8187. Human microdose pharmacokinetics showed low intersubject variability and prolonged oral absorption with first-order elimination kinetics compatible with once-daily dosing. These preclinical characteristics compare favorably with those of other NS3/4A inhibitors approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
Asthma is a worldwide health burden with an alarming prevalence. For years, asthma-associated airway injury remains elusive. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of the matrix molecules associated with airway remodeling. Human antigen R (HuR), the member of the Hu RNA-binding protein family, can bind to a subset of short-lived mRNAs in their 3' untranslated regions (UTR). However, the functional roles and relevant signaling pathways of HuR in airway remodeling have not been well illustrated. Thus, we aim to explore the relationship between HuR and TGF-β1 in platelet derived growth factor(PDGF)-induced airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells and asthmatic animal.
Cultured human ASM cells were stimulated by PDGF for 0, 6, 12 and 24 h. Western blotting, RT-PCR and immunofluoresence were used to detect the expression of HuR, TGF-β1, α-smooth muscle actins (α-SMA) and collagen type I (Col-I). Then knockdown of HuR, flow cytomerty was used to detect the morphological change and western blotting for functionally change of ASM cells. Furthermore, the interference of TGF-β1 and exogenous TGF-β1 were implemented to testify the influence on HuR. A murine OVA-driven allergic model based on sensitization and challenge was developed. The inflammatory response was measured by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), airway damage was analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, airway remodeling was assessed by sirius red staining and periodic acid-schiff staining, the expression level of HuR, TGF-β1 and α-SMA were measured by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
Here, we found that PDGF elevated HuR expression both at mRNA and protein level in cultured ASM cells at a time-dependent manner, which was simultaneously accompanied by the enhanced expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA and Col-I. Further study revealed that the knockdown of HuR significantly increased the apoptosis of ASM cells and dampened TGF-β1, Col-I and α-SMA expression. However, interfering TGF-β1 with siRNA or extra addition of TGF-β1, HuR could restore its production as well as Col-I. Compared with normal mice stimulating with PBS, OVA-induced mice owned high amount of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils except macrophages. HE staining showed accumulation of inflammatory cells surrounding bronchiole and sirius red staining distinguished collagen type I and III deposition around the bronchiole. Higher abundance of HuR, TGF-β1 and α-SMA were verified in OVA-induced mice than PBS-induced mice by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
A HuR/TGF-β1 feedback circuit was established to regulate airway remodeling in vivo and in vitro and targeting this feedback has considerable potential for the intervention of asthma.
Although RNA-binding proteins in plant phloem are believed to perform long-distance systemic transport of RNA in the phloem conduit, the structure of none of them is known. Arabidopsis thaliana phloem protein 16-1 (AtPP16-1) is such a putative mRNA transporter whose structure and backbone dynamics have been studied at pH 4.1 and 25 °C by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results obtained using basic optical spectroscopic tools show that the protein is unstable with little secondary structure near the physiological pH of the phloem sap. Fluorescence-monitored titrations reveal that AtPP16-1 binds not only A. thaliana RNA (Kdiss ∼ 67 nM) but also sheared DNA and model dodecamer DNA, though the affinity for DNA is ∼15-fold lower. In the solution structure of the protein, secondary structural elements are formed by residues 3-9 (β1), 56-62 (β2), 133-135 (β3), and 96-110 (α-helix). Most of the rest of the chain segments are disordered. The N-terminally disordered regions (residues 10-55) form a small lobe, which conjoins the rest of the molecule via a deep and large irregular cleft that could have functional implications. The average order parameter extracted by model-free analysis of 15N relaxation and {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE data is 0.66, suggesting less restricted backbone motion. The average conformational entropy of the backbone NH vectors is -0.31 cal mol-1 K-1. These results also suggest structural disorder in AtPP16-1.
Interaction of mitoxantrone (MTX) with G-quadruplex, leading to inhibition of telomerase enzyme and anticancer action, is not understood. Titrations of MTX with [d-(TTAGGGT)]4, comprising human telomere single repeat sequence, have been monitored by fluorescence and 1H/31P NMR spectroscopy. Binding induces chemical shift changes in GNH (~0.3ppm), T2/T7/A3 base protons and sequence specific shifts in 31P resonances. Absence of large downfield shifts in 31P signals and presence of all sequential NOEs show that classical intercalation of drug between base quartets does not occur. The upfield shift (~0.53ppm) in 2/3H, 1/4OH and minor shift in 6/7H aromatic protons of MTX in complex rule out end stacking as a possible mode of interaction. The 26 short inter molecular contacts of 1/4OH, 11NH, 6/7H and 12CH2 protons of MTX with T1, T2, G6, G7 protons in the structure of complex obtained by restrained Molecular Dynamics simulations show binding at grooves accompanied by 4 hydrogen bonds and partial stacking of MTX with base pairs. Interaction causes thermal stabilization, ΔTm=35°C, which may be attributed to telomerase inhibition. The present study is the first report on solution structure of mitoxantrone-[d-(TTAGGGT)]4 complex and is significant for structure based designing of anthraquinone derivatives as future drugs.
To determine frequency of fragile X associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) among Turkish premutation carriers.
FMR1 premutation is the single most common genetic cause of POI (FXPOI). Fragile X Registry at Hacettepe University has been reviewed for the frequency of FXPOI among female premutation carriers. Since 1991 when FMR1 testing was available, 760 individuals from 243 families have been registered. Actual data on menstrual status of female premutation carriers were gathered and analysed.
Among 314 premutation-bearing females in the cohort, 268 could be reached for an update of their menstrual history; 107 adults were 40 or younger and 156 were older than 40 years of age, whereas the remaining 5 patients were prepubertal. Among 263 postpubertal females with premutations, 90 women stopped menstruating before or at 40 years of age (premature ovarian failure - POF), constituting 34.2% of our cohort. Additionally, one carrier of a gray zone allele experienced FXPOI. History of twinning was present once in 18 women (5.7%) and twice in two women (0.6%), one of the latter interestingly bearing a full-mutation.
FXPOI rates in the present cohort are higher than those reported in other populations. Higher FXPOI rates in Turkish premutation carriers might be a reflection of younger mean menopause age and higher POI rates in otherwise healthy Turkish women. Since POI is much more frequent among premutation carriers than in general population, testing for CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 should be included in the work-up.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important mediator of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. The local effects of BDNF depend on the activation of translation activity, which requires the delivery of transcripts to the synapse. In this work, we found that neuronal activity regulates the dendritic localization of the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by stimulating BDNF-Trk signaling. Microarray experiments identified a large number of transcripts that are coimmunoprecipitated with hnRNP K, and about 60% of these transcripts are dissociated from the protein upon stimulation of rat hippocampal neurons with BDNF. In vivo studies also showed a role for TrkB signaling in the dissociation of transcripts from hnRNP K upon high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of medial perforant path-granule cell synapses of male rat dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, treatment of rat hippocampal synaptoneurosomes with BDNF decreased the coimmunoprecipitation of hnRNP K with mRNAs coding for glutamate receptor subunits, Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIβ (CaMKIIβ) and BDNF. Downregulation of hnRNP K impaired the BDNF-induced enhancement of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated mEPSC, and similar results were obtained upon inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The results demonstrate that BDNF regulates specific populations of hnRNP-associated mRNAs in neuronal dendrites and suggests an important role of hnRNP K in BDNF-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.
What is the dynamics of expression of P-element induced wimpy testis-like (PIWIL) proteins in the germline during human fetal development and spermatogenesis?
PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3 and PIWIL4 were expressed in a sex-specific fashion in human germ cells (GC) during development and adulthood. PIWILs showed a mutually exclusive pattern of subcellular localization. PIWILs were present in the intermitochondrial cement and a single large granule in meiotic GC and their expression was different from that observed in mice, highlighting species-differences.
In mice, PIWIL proteins play prominent roles in male infertility. PIWIL mouse mutants show either post-meiotic arrest at the round spermatid stage (PIWIL1) or arrest at the zygotene-pachytene stage of meiosis I (PIWIL2 and PIWIL4) in males, while females remain fertile. Recent studies have reported a robust piRNA pool in human fetal ovary.
This is a qualitative analysis of PIWILs expression in paraffin-embedded fetal human male (N = 8), female gonads (N = 6) and adult testes (N = 5), and bioinformatics analysis of online available single-cell transcriptomics data of human fetal germ cells (n = 242).
Human fetal gonads from elective abortion without medical indication and adult testes biopsies were donated for research with informed consent. Samples were fixed, paraffin-embedded and analyzed by immunofluorescence to study the temporal and cellular localization of PIWIL1, PIWIL2, PIWIL3 and PIWIL4.
PIWIL1, PIWIL2 and PIWIL4 showed a mutually exclusive pattern of subcellular localization, particularly in female oocytes. To our surprise, PIWIL1 immunostaining revealed the presence of a single dense paranuclear body, resembling the chromatoid body of haploid spermatocytes, in meiotic oocytes. Moreover, in contrast to mice, PIWIL4, but not PIWIL2, localized to the intermitochondrial cement. PIWIL3 was not expressed in GC during development. The upregulation of PIWIL transcripts correlated with the transcription of markers associated with piRNAs biogenesis like the TDRDs and HENMT1 in fetal GC.
Non-applicable.
This study is limited by the restricted number of samples and consequently stages analyzed.
In the germline, PIWILs ensure the integrity of the human genome protecting it from 'parasitic sequences'. This study offers novel insights on the expression dynamics of PIWILs during the window of epigenetic remodeling and meiosis, and highlights important differences between humans and mice, which may prove particularly important to understand causes of infertility and improve both diagnosis and treatment in humans.

Zika virus (ZIKV) of the Flaviviridae family is a recently emerged mosquito-borne virus that has been implicated in the surge of the number of microcephaly instances in South America. The recent rapid spread of the virus led to its declaration as a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The virus is transmitted mainly by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is also the vector of dengue virus; however, little is known about the interactions of the virus with the mosquito vector. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of whole A. aegypti mosquitoes in response to ZIKV infection at 2, 7, and 14 days postinfection using transcriptome sequencing. Results showed changes in the abundance of a large number of transcripts at each time point following infection, with 18 transcripts commonly changed among the three time points. Gene ontology analysis revealed that most of the altered genes are involved in metabolic processes, cellular processes, and proteolysis. In addition, 486 long intergenic noncoding RNAs that were altered upon ZIKV infection were identified. Further, we found changes of a number of potential mRNA target genes correlating with those of altered host microRNAs. The outcomes provide a basic understanding of A. aegypti responses to ZIKV and help to determine host factors involved in replication or mosquito host antiviral response against the virus. IMPORTANCE Vector-borne viruses pose great risks to human health. Zika virus has recently emerged as a global threat, rapidly expanding its distribution. Understanding the interactions of the virus with mosquito vectors at the molecular level is vital for devising new approaches in inhibiting virus transmission. In this study, we embarked on analyzing the transcriptional response of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to Zika virus infection. Results showed large changes in both coding and long noncoding RNAs. Analysis of these genes showed similarities with other flaviviruses, including dengue virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector. The outcomes provide a global picture of changes in the mosquito vector in response to Zika virus infection.
The genetic basis of earlobe attachment has been a matter of debate since the early 20th century, such that geneticists argue both for and against polygenic inheritance. Recent genetic studies have identified a few loci associated with the trait, but large-scale analyses are still lacking. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study of lobe attachment in a multiethnic sample of 74,660 individuals from four cohorts (three with the trait scored by an expert rater and one with the trait self-reported). Meta-analysis of the three expert-rater-scored cohorts revealed six associated loci harboring numerous candidate genes, including EDAR, SP5, MRPS22, ADGRG6 (GPR126), KIAA1217, and PAX9. The large self-reported 23andMe cohort recapitulated each of these six loci. Moreover, meta-analysis across all four cohorts revealed a total of 49 significant (p &lt; 5 × 10-8) loci. Annotation and enrichment analyses of these 49 loci showed strong evidence of genes involved in ear development and syndromes with auricular phenotypes. RNA sequencing data from both human fetal ear and mouse second branchial arch tissue confirmed that genes located among associated loci showed evidence of expression. These results provide strong evidence for the polygenic nature of earlobe attachment and offer insights into the biological basis of normal and abnormal ear development.
RNA regulation provides a finely tuned and highly co-ordinated control of gene expression. Regulation is mediated by hundreds to thousands of multi-functional RNA-binding proteins which often interact with large sets of RNAs. In this brief review, we focus on a recent work that highlights how the proteins use multiple RNA-binding domains to interact selectively with the different RNA targets. Deconvoluting the molecular complexity of the RNA regulatory network is essential to understanding cell differentiation and function, and requires accurate models for protein-RNA recognition and protein target selectivity. We discuss that the structural and molecular understanding of the key determinant of recognition, together with the availability of methods to examine protein-RNA interactions at the transcriptome level, may provide an avenue to establish these models.
Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare type of tumor with heterogenous histological patterns. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of IMP3, an oncofetal protein, in 31 MBC patients in association with histological subtypes and clinical outcomes. The cohort consisted of spindle cell carcinoma (SPC) (n=11), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n=14), matrix-producing carcinoma (MPC) (n=4), carcinoma with osteocartilaginous elements (COC) (n=1), and low grade adenosquamous cell carcinoma (ASC) (n=1). IMP3 expression was identified in 7 cases of SPC (64%) and 6 patients of all the other subtypes (p=0.051). In comparison between IMP3 high (n=13) and low (n=18) groups, a large-sized tumor (≥4.0cm) was identified in 9 IMP3 high patients, and 14 IMP3 low patients had a small-sized tumor (p=0.01). High Ki67 positivity was detected in all of the IMP3 high patients and in 7 of the IMP3 low patients (p=0.002). During the follow-up period, 9 IMP3 high patients died, whereas 15 of the 18 IMP3 low patients remained alive (p=0.004). A univariate analysis revealed that IMP3 expression and tumor size were significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes (p=0.03 and &lt;0.001, respectively). The IMP3 high group was likely to be associated with reduced overall survival compared to the IMP3 low group (p=0.06). These findings indicate that IMP3 may contribute to the aggressive behavior of MBC, and that this expression could potentially be a prognostic marker of MBC.
TERT promoter mutations are frequent in melanoma. Here we analysed the concordance and prognostic impact of TERT mutation and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein expression in a large melanoma series.
In 194 primary nodular melanomas with 72 matched loco-regional metastases, TERT promoter mutation status was assessed by Sanger sequencing and TERT protein expression by immunohistochemistry.
TERT mutations were found in 68% of primary melanomas and 64% of metastases, and the mutation status was discordant between primary tumour and metastasis in 24% of the cases. 6 of the 10 cases with discordant and wild-type metastases were also TERT wild type when re-tested in other intra-tumour regions, whereas 4 cases were mutation positive. TERT-mutated tumours tended to be thicker, have a higher mitotic count and higher patient age than TERT wild-type cases, but there was no significant association with reduced survival. TERT protein expression did not correlate with mutation status, but showed a similar discordancy between the primary and first metastatic lesion, and was significantly associated with reduced survival.
TERT promoter mutations showed inter- and intra-tumoural discordancy, whereas only expression of TERT protein was associated with reduced patient survival.
Identification of the function of metal ions and the RNA moieties, particularly nucleobases, that bind metal ions is important in RNA catalysis. Here we combine single-atom and abasic substitutions to probe functions of conserved nucleobases in ribonuclease P (RNase P). Structural and biophysical studies of bacterial RNase P propose direct coordination of metal ions by the nucleobases of conserved uridine and guanosine in helix P4 of the RNA subunit (P RNA). To biochemically probe the function of metal ion interactions, we substituted the universally conserved bulged uridine (U51) in the P4 helix of circularly permuted Bacillus subtilis P RNA with 4-thiouridine, 4-deoxyuridine, and abasic modifications and G378/379 with 2-aminopurine, N7-deazaguanosine, and 6-thioguanosine. The functional group modifications of U51 decrease RNase P-catalyzed phosphodiester bond cleavage 16- to 23-fold, as measured by the single-turnover cleavage rate constant. The activity of the 4-thiouridine RNase P is partially rescued by addition of Cd(II) or Mn(II) ions. This is the first time a metal-rescue experiment provides evidence for inner-sphere divalent metal ion coordination with a nucleobase. Modifications of G379 modestly decrease the cleavage activity of RNase P, suggesting outer-sphere coordination of O6 on G379 to a metal ion. These data provide biochemical evidence for catalytically important interactions of the P4 helix of P RNA with metal ions, demonstrating that the bulged uridine coordinates at least one catalytic metal ion through an inner-sphere interaction. The combination of single-atom and abasic nucleotide substitutions provides a powerful strategy to probe functions of conserved nucleobases in large RNAs.
Diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non‑Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes of DLBCL, ~30% of patients will develop relapse/refractory disease. Therefore, novel therapeutic drugs have been investigated to improve disease outcomes. Previous studies have revealed the anticancer effects of quinacrine (QC) on tumor cells in vitro, although its role in human DLBCL is yet to be identified. The present study sought to examine the cytotoxic effect of QC on DLBCL cells. QC induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the DLBCL cell lines SU‑DHL‑8 and OCI‑LY01, in a dose‑dependent manner, in addition to the downregulation of cyclin‑dependent kinase 4/6 and the upregulation of cleaved poly‑ADP ribose polymerase 1. Upon exposure to QC, RNA‑binding protein Musashi homolog 2 inactivation and activation of protein numb homolog were observed. In addition, QC was able to inhibit the expression of Myc proto‑oncogene protein. The results of the present study indicated that QC may be a potential anti‑DLBCL drug.
Liquid-based (LB)-FNA is widely recognized as a reliable diagnostic method to evaluate thyroid nodules. However, up to 30% of LB-FNA remain indeterminate according to the Bethesda system. Use of molecular biomarkers has been recommended to improve its pathological accuracy but implementation of these tests in clinical practice may be difficult. Here, we evaluated feasibility and performance of molecular profiling in routine practice by testing LB-FNA for BRAF, N/HRAS and TERT mutations.
We studied a large prospective cohort of 326 cases, including 61 atypia of undetermined significance, 124 follicular neoplasms, 72 suspicious for malignancy and 69 malignant cases. Diagnosis of malignancy was confirmed by histology on paired surgical specimen.
Mutated LB-FNAs were significantly associated with malignancy regardless of the cytological classification. Overall sensitivity was 60% and specificity 89%. Importantly, in atypia of undetermined significance and follicular neoplasm patients undergoing surgery according to the Bethesda guidelines, negative predictive values were 85.4% and 90% respectively. TERT promoter mutation was rare but very specific for malignancy (5.5%) suggesting that it could be of interest in patients with indeterminate cytology.
Mutation profiling can be successfully performed on thyroid LB-FNA without any dedicated sample in a pathology laboratory. It is an easy way to improve diagnostic accuracy of routine LB-FNA and may help to better select patients for surgery and to avoid unnecessary thyroidectomies.
The Streptococcus mutans Cid/Lrg system represents an ideal model to study how this organism withstands various stressors encountered in the oral cavity. Mutation of lrgAB renders S. mutans more sensitive to oxidative, heat, and vancomycin stresses. Here, we have performed a comprehensive proteomics experiment using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to compare the proteome changes of wild type UA159 and lrgAB mutant strains in response to these same stresses. Importantly, many of identified proteins showed either a strikingly large fold-change, or were completely suppressed or newly induced in response to a particular stress condition. Notable stress proteome changes occurred in a variety of functional categories, including amino acid biosynthesis, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, transport/binding, and transcriptional/response regulators. In the non-stressed growth condition, mutation of lrgAB significantly altered the abundance of 76 proteins (a fold change &gt;1.4, or &lt;0.6, p-value &lt;0.05) and several of these matched the stress proteome of the wild type strain. Interestingly, the statistical correlation between the proteome changes and corresponding RNA-seq transcriptomic studies was relatively low (rho(ρ) &lt;0.16), suggesting that adaptation to a new environment may require radical proteome turnover or metabolic remodeling. Collectively, this study reinforces the importance of LrgAB to the S. mutans stress response.
During environmental adaptation bacteria use small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) to repress or activate expression of a large fraction of their proteome. We extended the use of the in vivo RNA proximity ligation method toward probing global sRNA interactions with their targets in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and verified the method with a known regulon controlled by the PrrF1 sRNA. We also identified two sRNAs (Sr0161 and ErsA) that interact with the mRNA encoding the major porin OprD responsible for the uptake of carbapenem antibiotics. These two sRNAs base pair with the 5' UTR of oprD leading to increase in resistance of the bacteria to meropenem. Additional proximity ligation experiments and enrichment for Sr0161 targets identified the mRNA for the regulator of type III secretion system. Interaction between the exsA mRNA and Sr0161 leads to a block in the synthesis of a component of the T3SS apparatus and an effector. Another sRNA, Sr006, positively regulates, without Hfq, the expression of PagL, an enzyme responsible for deacylation of lipid A, reducing its pro-inflammatory property and resulting in polymyxin resistance. Therefore, an analysis of global sRNA-mRNA interactions can lead to discoveries of novel pathways controlling gene expression that are likely integrated into larger regulatory networks.
The vigilin family of proteins is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and characterized by the proteins' 14 or 15 hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, typically associated with RNA-binding. Vigilin is the largest RNA-binding protein (RBP) in the KH domain-containing family and one of the largest RBP known to date. Since its identification 30 years ago, vigilin has been shown to bind over 700 mRNAs and has been associated with cancer progression and cardiovascular disease. We provide a brief historic overview of vigilin research and outline the proteins' different functions, focusing on maintenance of genome ploidy, heterochromatin formation, RNA export, as well as regulation of translation, mRNA transport, and mRNA stability. The multitude of associated functions is reflected by the large number of identified interaction partners, ranging from tRNAs, mRNAs, ribosomes and ribosome-associated proteins, to histone methyltransferases and DNA-dependent protein kinases. Most of these partners bind to vigilin's carboxyterminus, and the two most C-terminal KH domains of the protein, KH13 and KH14, represent the main mRNA-binding interface. Since the nuclear functions of vigilins in particular are not conserved, we outline a model for the basal functions of vigilins, as well as those which were acquired during the transition from unicellular organisms to metazoa.

U1 snRNP (U1) functions in splicing introns and telescripting, which suppresses premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA). Using U1 inhibition in human cells, we show that U1 telescripting is selectively required for sustaining long-distance transcription elongation in introns of large genes (median 39 kb). Evidence of widespread PCPA in the same locations in normal tissues reveals that large genes incur natural transcription attrition. Underscoring the importance of U1 telescripting as a gene-size-based mRNA-regulation mechanism, small genes were not sensitive to PCPA, and the spliced-mRNA productivity of ∼1,000 small genes (median 6.8 kb) increased upon U1 inhibition. Notably, these small, upregulated genes were enriched in functions related to acute stimuli and cell-survival response, whereas genes subject to PCPA were enriched in cell-cycle progression and developmental functions. This gene size-function polarization increased in metazoan evolution by enormous intron expansion. We propose that telescripting adds an overarching layer of regulation to size-function-stratified genomes, leveraged by selective intron expansion to rapidly shift gene expression priorities.
Crosslinking or RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq or RIP-seq) allows transcriptome-wide discovery of RNA regulatory sites. As CLIP-seq/RIP-seq reads are short, existing computational tools focus on uniquely mapped reads, while reads mapped to multiple loci are discarded. We present CLAM (CLIP-seq Analysis of Multi-mapped reads). CLAM uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to assign multi-mapped reads and calls peaks combining uniquely and multi-mapped reads. To demonstrate the utility of CLAM, we applied it to a wide range of public CLIP-seq/RIP-seq datasets involving numerous splicing factors, microRNAs and m6A RNA methylation. CLAM recovered a large number of novel RNA regulatory sites inaccessible by uniquely mapped reads. The functional significance of these sites was demonstrated by consensus motif patterns and association with alternative splicing (splicing factors), transcript abundance (AGO2) and mRNA half-life (m6A). CLAM provides a useful tool to discover novel protein-RNA interactions and RNA modification sites from CLIP-seq and RIP-seq data, and reveals the significant contribution of repetitive elements to the RNA regulatory landscape of the human transcriptome.
Is Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast Cancer 1 (GREB1) required for progesterone-driven endometrial stromal cell decidualization?
GREB1 is a novel progesterone-responsive gene required for progesterone-driven human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization.
Successful establishment of pregnancy requires HESCs to transform from fibroblastic to epithelioid cells in a process called decidualization. This process depends on the hormone progesterone, but the molecular mechanisms by which it occurs have not been determined.
Primary and transformed HESCs in which GREB1 expression was knocked down were decidualized in culture for up to 6 days. Wild-type and progesterone receptor (PR) knockout mice were treated with progesterone, and their uteri were assessed for levels of GREB1 expression.
Analysis of previous data included data mining of expression profile data sets and in silico transcription factor-binding analysis. Endometrial biopsies obtained from healthy women of reproductive age during the proliferative phase (Days 8-12) of their menstrual cycle were used for isolating HESCs. Experiments were carried out with early passage (no more than four passages) HESCs isolated from at least three subjects. Transcript levels of decidualization markers prolactin (PRL) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) were detected by quantitative RT-PCR as readouts for HESC decidualization. Cells were also imaged by phase-contrast microscopy. To assess the requirement for GREB1, PR and SRC-2, cells were transfected with specifically targeted small interfering RNAs. Results are shown as mean and SE from three replicates of one representative patient-derived primary endometrial cell line. Experiments were also conducted with transformed HESCs.
Progesterone treatment of mice and transformed HESCs led to an ~5-fold (5.6 ± 0.81, P &lt; 0.05, and 5.2 ± 0.26, P &lt; 0.01, respectively) increase in GREB1 transcript levels. This increase was significantly reduced in the uteri of PR knock-out mice (P &lt; 0.01), in HESCs treated with the PR antagonist RU486 (P &lt; 0.01), or in HESCs in which PR expression was knocked down (P &lt; 0.05). When GREB1 expression was knocked down, progesterone-driven decidualization markers in both immortalized and primary HESCs was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01). Finally, GREB1 knock down signficantly reduced expression of the PR target genes WNT4 and FOXOA1 (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively).
This study used the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas.
Although in vitro cell culture studies indicate that GREB1 is required for endoemtrial decidualization, the in vivo role of GREB1 in endometrial function and dysfunction should be assessed by using knock-out mouse models.
Identification and functional analysis of GREB1 as a key molecular mediator of decidualization may lead to improved diagnosis and clinical management of women with peri-implantation loss due to inadequate endometrial decidualization.

Recent research has shown that IFITM3 plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of many malignancies. We investigated the clinicopathological variables and prognostic value of IFITM3 in stage IIA esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.
Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used to examine IFITM3 expression in tumor specimens. The relationships between IFITM3 expression and clinicopathological variables, as well as the five-year survival and recurrence status of patients, were analyzed.
IFITM3 was aberrantly expressed in tumor tissue. Statistical analysis showed a close correlation of IFITM3 expression with T tumor status (P = 0.004). Additionally, IFITM3 overexpression, advanced T status, poor degree of differentiation, and large tumor size were not only associated with poor survival but were high lymphatic metastatic recurrence predictors in ESCC patients (P &lt; 0.05).
Our data indicated that IFITM3 overexpression may predict poor prognosis in stage IIA ESCC patients after Ivor Lewis esophagectomy.
According to the clonal model of tumor evolution, trunk alterations arise at early stages and are ubiquitous. Through the characterization of early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, we aimed to identify trunk alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and study their intra- and inter-tumor distribution in advanced lesions.
A total of 151 samples representing the multistep process of hepatocarcinogenesis were analyzed by targeted-sequencing and a single nucleotide polymorphism array. Genes altered in early lesions (31 dysplastic nodules [DNs] and 38 small HCCs [sHCC]) were defined as trunk. Their distribution was explored in: a) different regions of large tumors (43 regions, 21 tumors), and b) different nodules of the same patient (39 tumors, 17 patients). Multinodular lesions were classified as intrahepatic metastases (IMs) or synchronous tumors based on chromosomal aberrations.
TERT promoter mutations (10.5%) and broad copy-number aberrations in chromosomes 1 and 8 (3-7%) were identified as trunk gatekeepers in DNs and were maintained in sHCCs. Trunk drivers identified in sHCCs included TP53 (23%) and CTNNB1 (11%) mutations, and focal amplifications or deletions in known drivers (6%). Overall, TERT, TP53 and CTNNB1 mutations were the most frequent trunk events and at least one was present in 51% of sHCCs. Around 90% of mutations in these genes were ubiquitous among different regions of large tumors. In multinodular HCCs, 35% of patients harbored IMs; 85% of mutations in TERT, TP53 and/or CTNNB1 were retained in primary and metastatic tumors.
Trunk events in early stages (TERT, TP53, CTNNB1 mutations) were ubiquitous across different regions of the same tumor and between primary and metastatic nodules in &gt;85% of cases. This concept supports the knowledge that single biopsies would suffice to capture trunk mutations in HCC.
Trunk alterations arise at early stages of cancer and are shared among all malignant cells of the tumor. In order to identify trunk alterations in HCC, we characterized early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis represented by dysplastic nodules and small lesions. Mutations in TERT, TP53 and CTNNB1 genes were the most frequent. Analyses in more advanced lesions showed that mutations in these same genes were shared between different regions of the same tumor and between primary and metastatic tumors, suggesting their trunk role in this disease.
In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, RAD51C, PALB2 and BRIP1 are known as breast cancer susceptibility genes. However, the mutation status of these genes in Japanese familial breast cancer cases has not yet been evaluated. To this end, we analyzed the exon sequence and genomic rearrangement of RAD51C, PALB2 and BRIP1 in 100 Japanese patients diagnosed with familial breast and ovarian cancer and without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. We detected a large deletion from exons 6 to 9 in RAD51C, 4 novel BRIP1 missense variants containing 3 novel non-synonymous variants, c.89A&gt;C, c.736A&gt;G and c.2131A&gt;G, and a splice donor site variant c.918+2T&gt;C. No deleterious variant of PALB2 was detected. The results of pedigree analysis showed that the proband with a large deletion on RAD51C had a family history of both breast and ovarian cancer, and the families of probands with novel BRIP1 missense variants included a male patient with breast cancer or many patients with breast cancer within the second-degree relatives. We showed that the mutation frequency of RAD51C in Japanese familial breast cancer cases was similar to that in Western countries and that the prevalence of deleterious mutation of PALB2 was possibly lower. Furthermore, our results suggested that BRIP1 mutation frequency in Japan might differ from that in Western countries.
The presence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies has been linked with autoimmunity in general and with several autoimmune diseases (AID) in particular. In the current study we evaluated these antibodies in a wide spectrum of AID as well as the links between them and anti-infectious antibodies.
We examined 2082 sera from patients with 16 different AID compared to 524 sera from geographically-matched healthy controls, for the presence and titres of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB. All samples were also tested for a variety of anti-infectious agents' antibodies using the BioPlex 2200-immunoassay (Bio-Rad, USA).
Anti-Ro/SSA was more prevalent, with significantly higher titre in 5 autoimmune diseases namely Sjögren's syndrome (SS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) both primary and APS linked to SLE, systemic sclerosis (SSc) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Anti-La/SSB was more prevalent with higher titers in SS, SLE, APS linked to SLE and PBC. Prevalence, but not titers, of both antibodies were higher also in polymyositis (PM). Additionally, we found a correlation between anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and antibodies of the IgM and IgG subtypes directed at cytomegalovirus as well as IgG-antibodies directed at Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and toxoplasma (p&lt;0.001). Anti-La/SSB antibodies correlated with the presence of IgG antibodies against EBV early antigen (p&lt;0.001).
In a large cohort of patients with autoimmune diseases we found an association between anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies and 6 autoimmune diseases, amongst which primary APS and PM. Additionally, we observed linkages between these autoantibodies and anti-infectious antibodies directed at Epstein-Barr virus, toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus. Our findings support the concept of interplay between infectious agents and autoimmunity, such as the plausibility of an infectious agent that trigger the immune system to produce specific antibodies which will later result in a unique group of AID.
Influenza virus expresses transcripts early in infection and transitions towards genome replication at later time points. This process requires de novo assembly of the viral replication machinery, large ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) composed of the viral polymerase, genomic RNA and oligomeric nucleoprotein (NP). Despite the central role of RNPs during infection, the factors dictating where and when they assemble are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that human protein kinase C (PKC) family members regulate RNP assembly. Activated PKCδ interacts with the polymerase subunit PB2 and phospho-regulates NP oligomerization and RNP assembly during infection. Consistent with its role in regulating RNP assembly, knockout of PKCδ impairs virus infection by selectively disrupting genome replication. However, primary transcription from pre-formed RNPs deposited by infecting particles is unaffected. Thus, influenza virus exploits host PKCs to regulate RNP assembly, a step required for the transition from primary transcription to genome replication during the infectious cycle.
In rodent and human brains, the small GTP-binding protein Rhes is highly expressed in virtually all dopaminoceptive striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons, as well as in large aspiny cholinergic interneurons, where it is thought to modulate dopamine-dependent signaling. Consistent with this knowledge, and considering that dopaminergic neurotransmission is altered in neurological and psychiatric disorders, here we sought to investigate whether Rhes mRNA expression is altered in brain regions of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and Bipolar Disorder (BD), when compared to healthy controls (about 200 post-mortem samples). Moreover, we performed the same analysis in the putamen of non-human primate Macaca Mulatta, lesioned with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Overall, our data indicated comparable Rhes mRNA levels in the brain of patients with SCZ and BD, and their respective healthy controls. In sharp contrast, the putamen of patients suffering from PD showed a significant 35% reduction of this transcript, compared to healthy subjects. Interestingly, in line with observations obtained in humans, we found 27% decrease in Rhes mRNA levels in the putamen of MPTP-treated primates. Based on the established inhibitory influence of Rhes on dopamine-related responses, we hypothesize that its striatal downregulation in PD patients and animal models of PD might represent an adaptive event of the dopaminergic system to functionally counteract the reduced nigrostriatal innervation.
The core body temperature of all mammals oscillates with the time of the day. However, direct molecular consequences of small, physiological changes in body temperature remain largely elusive. Here we show that body temperature cycles drive rhythmic SR protein phosphorylation to control an alternative splicing (AS) program. A temperature change of 1°C is sufficient to induce a concerted splicing switch in a large group of functionally related genes, rendering this splicing-based thermometer much more sensitive than previously described temperature-sensing mechanisms. AS of two exons in the 5' UTR of the TATA-box binding protein (Tbp) highlights the general impact of this mechanism, as it results in rhythmic TBP protein levels with implications for global gene expression in vivo. Together our data establish body temperature-driven AS as a core clock-independent oscillator in mammalian peripheral clocks.
Clonostachys rosea is a potential biocontrol fungus that can produce highly resistant chlamydospores under specific conditions. To investigate the genes related to chlamydospore formation, we identified reliable reference genes for quantification of gene expression in C. rosea 67-1 during sporulation. In this study, nine reference genes, actin (ACT), elongation factor 1 (EF1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone (HIS), RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatase Fcp1 (RPP), succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSD), TATA-binding protein (TBP), ubiquitin (UBQ), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UCE), were selected and cloned from 67-1, and their expression stability during chlamydospore formation was determined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR and assessed using the software geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The Ct values of the candidates ranged from 19.9 to 29.7, among which HIS, ACT and SSD exhibited high expression levels. The statistical analysis showed that ACT and SSD were most stably expressed, while UBQ and GAPDH showed relatively large variations under different culture conditions. Calculation of pairwise variation value indicated that two reference genes were required for precise quantification. Finally, ACT and SSD were selected to normalize gene expression during chlamydospore production in C. rosea 67-1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SSD as a reference gene. This study will facilitate the accurate quantification of differentially expressed genes during the generation of chlamydospores and contribute to the investigation of the molecular mechanism underlying chlamydospore formation in C. rosea.
Microarrays and RNA sequencing are widely used to profile transcriptome remodeling during myocardial ischemia. However, the steady-state RNA analysis lacks in sensitivity to detect all noncoding RNA species and does not provide separation between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of nascent RNA profiles of mRNAs, primary micro-RNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and enhancer RNAs in a large animal model of acute infarction.
Acute infarction was induced by cardiac catheterization of domestic swine. Nuclei isolated from healthy, border zone, and ischemic regions of the affected heart were subjected to global run-on sequencing. Global run-on sequencing analysis indicated that half of affected genes are regulated at the level of transcriptional pausing. A gradient of induction of inflammatory mediators and repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling and oxidative phosphorylation was detected when moving from healthy toward infarcted area. In addition, we interrogated the transcriptional regulation of primary micro-RNAs and provide evidence that several arrhythmia-related target genes exhibit repression at post-transcriptional level. We identified 450 long noncoding RNAs differently regulated by ischemia, including novel conserved long noncoding RNAs expressed in antisense orientation to myocardial transcription factors GATA-binding protein 4, GATA-binding protein 6, and Krüppel-like factor 6. Finally, characterization of enhancers exhibiting differential expression of enhancer RNAs pointed a central role for Krüppel-like factor, MEF2C, ETS, NFY, ATF, E2F2, and NRF1 transcription factors in determining transcriptional responses to ischemia.
Global run-on sequencing allowed us to follow the gradient of gene expression occurring in the ischemic heart and identify novel noncoding RNAs regulated by oxygen deprivation. These findings highlight potential new targets for diagnosis and treatment of myocardial ischemia.
With the development of advanced genomic methods, a large amount of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been found to be important for cancer initiation and progression. Given that most of the genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified cancer risk SNPs are located in the noncoding region, the expression and function of lncRNAs are more likely to be affected by the SNPs. The SNPs may affect the expression of lncRNAs directly through disrupting the binding of transcription factors or indirectly by affecting the expression of regulatory factors. Moreover, SNPs may disrupt the interaction between lncRNAs and other RNAs or proteins. Unveiling the relationship of lncRNA, protein-coding genes, transcription factors and miRNAs from the angle of genomics will improve the accuracy of disease prediction and help find new therapeutic targets.
Targeting angiogenesis has been considered a promising treatment of choice for a large number of malignancies, including gastrointestinal cancers. Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) being used for this purpose. However, treatment efficacy is largely questioned. Telomerase activity, responsible for cancer cell immortality, is detected in 85-95% of human cancers and is considered a potential regulator of VEGF. The aim of our study was to investigate the interrelationship between VEGF and hTERT in gastrointestinal cancers and to explore cell response to a combined inhibition of telomerase and VEGF.
AGS (gastric cancer), Caco-2 (colorectal cancer) and HepG2/C3A (hepatocellular carcinoma), were treated with telomerase inhibitors BIBR-1232 (10μM) and costunolide (10μM), with bevacizumab (Avastin® at 5 ng/ml or 100μg/ml) or with a combination of both types of inhibitors. VEGF and hTERT mRNA levels, and telomerase activity were detected by RT-PCR. VEGF levels were quantified by ELISA. Telomerase was knocked down using hTERT siRNA and hTERT was overexpressed in the telomerase negative cell line, Saos-2 (osteosarcoma), using constructs expressing either wild type hTERT (hTERT-WT) or dominant negative hTERT (hTERT-DN). Tube formation by HUVECs was assessed using ECMatrix™ (EMD Millipore).
Our results showed that telomerase regulates VEGF expression and secretion through its catalytic subunit hTERT in AGS, Caco2, and HepG2/C3A, independent of its catalytic activity. Interestingly, VEGF inhibition with bevacizumab (100μg/ml) increased hTERT expression 42.3% in AGS, 94.1% in Caco2, and 52.5% in HepG2/C3A, and increased telomerase activity 30-fold in AGS, 10.3-fold in Caco2 and 8-fold in HepG2/C3A. A further investigation showed that VEGF upregulates hTERT expression in a mechanism that implicates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and HIF-1α. Moreover, bevacizumab treatment increased VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 expression in cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through hTERT. Thus, the combination of bevacizumab with telomerase inhibitors decreased VEGF expression and secretion by cancer cells, inhibited VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 upregulation, and reduced tube formation by HUVECs.
Taken together, our results suggest that bevacizumab treatment activates a VEGF autoregulatory mechanism involving hTERT and VEGF receptors and that an inhibition of this pathway could improve tumor cell response to anti-VEGF treatment.
The conserved RNA-binding protein, Hfq, has multiple regulatory roles within the prokaryotic cell, including promoting stable duplex formation between small RNAs and mRNAs, and thus hfq deletion mutants have pleiotropic phenotypes. Previous proteome and transcriptome studies of Neisseria meningitidis have generated limited insight into differential gene expression due to Hfq loss. In this study, reversed-phase liquid chromatography combined with data-independent alternate scanning mass spectrometry (LC-MSE) was utilized for rapid high-resolution quantitative proteomic analysis to further elucidate the differentially expressed proteome of a meningococcal hfq deletion mutant. Whole-cell lysates of N. meningitidis serogroup B H44/76 wild-type (wt) and H44/76Δhfq (Δhfq) grown in liquid growth medium were subjected to tryptic digestion. The resulting peptide mixtures were separated by liquid chromatography (LC) prior to analysis by mass spectrometry (MSE). Differential expression was analyzed by Student's t-test with control for false discovery rate (FDR). Reliable quantitation of relative expression comparing wt and Δhfq was achieved with 506 proteins (20%). Upon FDR control at q ≤ 0.05, 48 up- and 59 downregulated proteins were identified. From these, 81 were identified as novel Hfq-regulated candidates, while 15 proteins were previously found by SDS/PAGE/MS and 24 with microarray analyses. Thus, using LC-MSE we have expanded the repertoire of Hfq-regulated proteins. In conjunction with previous studies, a comprehensive network of Hfq-regulated proteins was constructed and differentially expressed proteins were found to be involved in a large variety of cellular processes. The results and comparisons with other gram-negative model systems, suggest still unidentified sRNA analogs in N. meningitidis.
Long interspersed nuclear element-1s (LINE-1s, or L1s) are an active family of retrotransposable elements that continue to mutate mammalian genomes. Despite the large contribution of L1 to mammalian genome evolution, we do not know where active L1 particles (particles in the process of retrotransposition) are located in the cell, or how they move towards the nucleus, the site of L1 reverse transcription. Using a yeast model of LINE retrotransposition, we identified ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) as a critical complex for LINE retrotransposition, and verified that this interaction is conserved for human L1. ESCRT interacts with L1 via a late domain motif, and this interaction facilitates L1 replication. Loss of the L1/ESCRT interaction does not impair RNP formation or enzymatic activity, but leads to loss of retrotransposition and reduced L1 endonuclease activity in the nucleus. This study highlights the importance of the ESCRT complex in the L1 life cycle and suggests an unusual mode for L1 RNP trafficking.
Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare multisystemic disorder associated with an expansion of CUG repeats in mutant DMPK (dystrophia myotonica protein kinase) transcripts; the main effect of these expansions is the induction of pre-mRNA splicing defects by sequestering muscleblind-like family proteins (e.g. MBNL1). Disruption of the CUG repeats and the MBNL1 protein complex has been established as the best therapeutic approach for DM1, hence two main strategies have been proposed: targeted degradation of mutant DMPK transcripts and the development of CUG-binding molecules that prevent MBNL1 sequestration. Herein, suitable CUG-binding small molecules were selected using in silico approaches such as scaffold analysis, similarity searching, and druggability analysis. We used polarization assays to confirm the CUG repeat binding in vitro for a number of candidate compounds, and went on to evaluate the biological activity of the two with the strongest affinity for CUG repeats (which we refer to as compounds 1-2 and 2-5) in DM1 mutant cells and Drosophila DM1 models with an impaired locomotion phenotype. In particular, 1-2 and 2-5 enhanced the levels of free MBNL1 in patient-derived myoblasts in vitro and greatly improved DM1 fly locomotion in climbing assays. This work provides new computational approaches for rational large-scale virtual screens of molecules that selectively recognize CUG structures. Moreover, it contributes valuable knowledge regarding two compounds with desirable biological activity in DM1 models.
Ichthyoses are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of genodermatoses associated with abnormal scaling of the skin over the whole body. Mutations in nine genes are known to cause non-syndromic forms of autosomal-recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). However, not all genetic causes for ARCI have been discovered to date. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and multigene panel screening, we identified 6 ARCI-affected individuals from three unrelated families with mutations in Sulfotransferase family 2B member 1 (SULT2B1), showing their causative association with ARCI. Cytosolic sulfotransferases form a large family of enzymes that are involved in the synthesis and metabolism of several steroids in humans. We identified four distinct mutations including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations. We demonstrated the loss of SULT2B1 expression at RNA and protein levels in keratinocytes from individuals with ARCI by functional analyses. Furthermore, we succeeded in reconstructing the morphologic skin alterations in a 3D organotypic tissue culture model with SULT2B1-deficient keratinocytes and fibroblasts. By thin layer chromatography (TLC) of extracts from these organotypic cultures, we could show the absence of cholesterol sulfate, the metabolite of SULT2B1, and an increased level of cholesterol, indicating a disturbed cholesterol metabolism of the skin upon loss-of-function mutation in SULT2B1. In conclusion, our study reveals an essential role for SULT2B1 in the proper development of healthy human skin. Mutation in SULT2B1 leads to an ARCI phenotype via increased proliferation of human keratinocytes, thickening of epithelial layers, and altered epidermal cholesterol metabolism.
Several viruses have been found to encode a deubiquitinating protease (DUB). These viral DUBs are proposed to play a role in regulating innate immune or inflammatory signaling. In human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the largest tegument protein encoded by UL48 contains DUB activity, but its cellular targets are not known. Here, we show that UL48 and UL45, an HCMV-encoded inactive homolog of cellular ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) large subunit (R1), target receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) to inhibit NF-κB signaling. Transfection assays showed that UL48 and UL45, which binds to UL48, interact with RIP1 and that UL48 DUB activity and UL45 cooperatively suppress RIP1-mediated NF-κB activation. The growth of UL45-null mutant virus was slightly impaired with showing reduced accumulation of viral late proteins. Analysis of a recombinant virus expressing HA-UL45 showed that UL45 interacts with both UL48 and RIP1 during virus infection. Infection with the mutant viruses also revealed that UL48 DUB activity and UL45 inhibit TNFα-induced NF-κB activation at late times of infection. UL48 cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIP1. Although UL45 alone did not affect RIP1 ubiquitination, it could enhance the UL48 activity to cleave RIP1 polyubiquitin chains. Consistently, UL45-null virus infection showed higher ubiquitination level of endogenous RIP1 than HA-UL45 virus infection at late times. Moreover, UL45 promoted the UL48-RIP1 interaction and re-localization of RIP1 to the UL48-containing virion assembly complex. The mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-encoded DUB, M48, interacted with mouse RIP1 and M45, an MCMV homolog of UL45. Collectively, our data demonstrate that cytomegalovirus-encoded DUB and inactive R1 homolog target RIP1 and cooperatively inhibit RIP1-mediated NF-κB signaling at the late stages of HCMV infection.
Recent evidence indicates that E2F1 transcription factor have pivotal roles in the regulation of cellular processes, and is found to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also reported to exert important effect on tumorigenesis. E2F1 is aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer (GC), and biology functions of E2F1 in GC are controversial. The biological characteristics of E2F1 and correlation between E2F1 and lncRNAs in GC remain to be found. In this study, integrated analysis revealed that E2F1 expression was significantly increased in GC cases and its expression was positively correlated with the poor pathologic stage, large tumor size and poor prognosis. Forced E2F1 expression promotes proliferation, whereas loss of E2F1 function decreased cell proliferation by blocking of cell cycle in GC cells. Mechanistic analyses indicated that E2F1 accelerates GC growth partly through induces TINCR transcription. TINCR could bind to STAU1 (staufen1) protein, and influence CDKN2B mRNA stability and expression, thereby affecting the proliferation of GC cells. Together, our findings suggest that E2F1/TINCR/STAU1/CDKN2B signaling axis contributes to the oncogenic potential of GC and may constitute a potential therapeutic target in this disease.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent complex psychiatric disorders in children as well as adults. ADHD impacts not only the affected individuals but also their families and social and professional networks. The clinical and diagnostic criteria for ADHD remain imprecise, in part, due to lack of robust biomarkers. ADHD comprises multiple subsets of diseases that present a shared set of downstream clinical findings, while displaying extensive molecular heterogeneity. This calls for innovation in diagnostic strategies that can help establish an ADHD diagnosis unequivocally as well as guiding precision medicine in this common mental health disorder. No study has examined, to the best of our knowledge, the upstream regulation of miRNAs that impact the downstream final ADHD phenotype. The latter focus on putative genetic biomarkers that regulate the regulators and can be tested empirically, for example, through genetic association analyses of the biogenesis pathways for miRNAs that impact the ADHD phenotype. Hence, we report here polymorphic variation in 10 miRNA biogenesis pathway candidate genes, including RNASEN, DGCR8, XPO5, RAN, DICER1, TARBP2, AGO1, AGO2, GEMIN3, and GEMIN4, in a large sample from the Eastern Mediterranean region (N = 355; 191 cases and 164 controls). We found that AGO1 rs595961 was significantly associated with ADHD susceptibility (p &lt; 0.05). While polymorphic variation in other miRNA biogenesis pathway genes did not display a significant association in the present sample, the observations reported herein on miRNA biogenesis variation offer a new avenue of research for innovation in biomarker discovery concerning ADHD and other complex psychiatric diseases with major global health burden.
The development of hepatoblastoma (HBL) is associated with failure of hepatic stem cells (HSC) to differentiate into hepatocytes. Despite intensive investigations, mechanisms of the failure of HSC to differentiate are not known. We found that oncogene Gankyrin (Gank) is involved in the inhibition of differentiation of HSC via triggering degradation of tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) Rb, p53, C/EBPα and HNF4α. Our data show that the activation of a repressor of Gank, farnesoid X receptor, FXR, after initiation of liver cancer by Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) prevents the development of liver cancer by inhibiting Gank and rescuing tumor suppressor proteins. We next analyzed FXR-Gank-Tumor suppressor pathways in a large cohort of HBL patients which include 6 controls and 53 HBL samples. Systemic analysis of these samples and RNA-Seq approach revealed that the FXR-Gank axis is activated; markers of hepatic stem cells are dramatically elevated and hepatocyte markers are reduced in HBL samples. In the course of these studies, we found that RNA binding protein CUGBP1 is a new tumor suppressor protein which is reduced in all HBL samples. Therefore, we generated CUGBP1 KO mice and examined HBL signatures in the liver of these mice. Micro-array studies revealed that the HBL-specific molecular signature is developed in livers of CUGBP1 KO mice at very early ages. Thus, we conclude that FXR-Gank-TSPs-Stem cells pathway is a key determinant of liver cancer in animal models and in pediatric liver cancer. Our data provide a strong basis for development of FXR-Gank-based therapy for treatment of patients with hepatoblastoma.
Our increasing understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biology holds promise for personalized care, however its translation into clinical practice requires a precise knowledge of its relationship to tumour phenotype.
We aimed at investigating molecular-phenotypic correlations in a large series of HCC. To this purpose, 343 surgically resected HCC samples were investigated by pathological review, immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling and sequencing.
CTNNB1 (40%) and TP53 (21%) mutations were mutually exclusive and defined two major groups of HCC characterized by distinct phenotypes. CTNNB1 mutated tumours were large (p=0.002), well-differentiated (p&lt;0.001), cholestatic (p&lt;0.001), with microtrabecular (p&lt;0.001) and pseudoglandular (p&lt;0.001) patterns and without inflammatory infiltrates (p&lt;0.001). TP53 mutated tumours were poorly differentiated (p&lt;0.001) with a compact pattern (p=0.02), multinucleated (p=0.01) and pleomorphic (p=0.02) cells and frequent vascular invasion (p=0.02). World Health Organization (WHO) classification of histological subtypes were also strongly related to molecular features. The scirrhous subtype was associated with TSC1/TSC2 mutations (p=0.005), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and a progenitor expression profile. The steatohepatitic subtype showed frequent IL-6/JAK/STAT activation without CTNNB1, TERT and TP53 pathway alterations (p=0.01). Pathological review identified a novel subtype, designated as "macrotrabecular-massive" associated with poor survival (p&lt;0.001), high alpha-fetoprotein serum level (p=0.02), vascular invasion (p&lt;0.001), TP53 mutations (p&lt;0.001) and FGF19 amplifications (p=0.02), features also validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Finally, integration of HCC pathological characteristics with its transcriptomic classification showed phenotypically distinct tumour subclasses closely related to G1-G6 subgroups.
HCC phenotypes are tightly associated with gene mutations and transcriptomic classification. These findings may help in translating our knowledge of HCC biology into clinical practice. Lay summary: HCC is a very heterogenous tumour, both at the pathological and molecular levels. We show here that HCC phenotype is tightly associated to its molecular alterations and underlying oncogenic pathways.
Repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene have been recognized as a major contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia in the Caucasian population. Intermediate length repeat expansions of CAG (polyQ) repeat in the ATXN2 gene have also been reported to increase the risk of developing ALS in North America and Europe. We screened 131 ALS patients and 127 healthy controls from India for C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat expansions. We found pathogenic hexanucleotide expansions in 3 of the 127 sporadic ALS patients, in 1 of the 4 familial ALS patients, and in none of the healthy controls. In addition, our findings suggest that the 10 base-pair deletion that masks detection of C9orf72 repeat expansion does not explain the low frequency of this repeat expansion among Indian ALS patients. Intermediate length polyQ expansions (27Qs-32Qs) in the ATXN2 gene were detected in 6 of the 127 sporadic ALS patients and 2 of the 127 of the healthy controls. Long ATXN2 polyQ repeats (≥33Qs) were not present in any of the ALS patients or controls. Our findings highlight the need for large-scale multicenter studies on Indian ALS patients to better understand the underlying genetic causes.
Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that binds CCAAT elements. The NF-Y trimer is composed of a Histone Fold Domain (HFD) dimer (NF-YB/NF-YC) and NF-YA, which confers DNA sequence specificity. NF-YA shares a conserved domain with the CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE, TOC1 (CCT) proteins. We show that CONSTANS (CO/B-BOX PROTEIN1 BBX1), a master flowering regulator, forms a trimer with Arabidopsis thaliana NF-YB2/NF-YC3 to efficiently bind the CORE element of the FLOWERING LOCUS T promoter. We term this complex NF-CO. Using saturation mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and RNA-sequencing profiling of co, nf-yb, and nf-yc mutants, we identify CCACA elements as the core NF-CO binding site. CO physically interacts with the same HFD surface required for NF-YA association, as determined by mutations in NF-YB2 and NF-YC9, and tested in vitro and in vivo. The co-7 mutation in the CCT domain, corresponding to an NF-YA arginine directly involved in CCAAT recognition, abolishes NF-CO binding to DNA. In summary, a unifying molecular mechanism of CO function relates it to the NF-YA paradigm, as part of a trimeric complex imparting sequence specificity to HFD/DNA interactions. It is likely that members of the large CCT family participate in similar complexes with At-NF-YB and At-NF-YC, broadening HFD combinatorial possibilities in terms of trimerization, DNA binding specificities, and transcriptional regulation.
Efficient collective migration depends on a balance between contractility and cytoskeletal rearrangements, adhesion, and mechanical cell-cell communication, all controlled by GTPases of the RHO family. By comprehensive screening of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in human bronchial epithelial cell monolayers, we identified GEFs that are required for collective migration at large, such as SOS1 and β-PIX, and RHOA GEFs that are implicated in intercellular communication. Down-regulation of the latter GEFs differentially enhanced front-to-back propagation of guidance cues through the monolayer and was mirrored by down-regulation of RHOA expression and myosin II activity. Phenotype-based clustering of knockdown behaviors identified RHOA-ARHGEF18 and ARHGEF3-ARHGEF28-ARHGEF11 clusters, indicating that the latter may signal through other RHO-family GTPases. Indeed, knockdown of RHOC produced an intermediate between the two phenotypes. We conclude that for effective collective migration, the RHOA-GEFs → RHOA/C → actomyosin pathways must be optimally tuned to compromise between generation of motility forces and restriction of intercellular communication.
Modifications in mRNA constitute ancient mechanisms to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prominent mRNA modification, and is installed by a large methyltransferase complex (the m6A 'writer'), not only specifically bound by RNA-binding proteins (the m6A 'readers'), but also removed by demethylases (the m6A 'erasers'). m6A mRNA modifications have been linked to regulation at multiple steps in mRNA processing. In analogy to the regulation of gene expression by miRNAs, we propose that the main function of m6A is post-transcriptional fine-tuning of gene expression. In contrast to miRNA regulation, which mostly reduces gene expression, we argue that m6A provides a fast mean to post-transcriptionally maximize gene expression. Additionally, m6A appears to have a second function during developmental transitions by targeting m6A-marked transcripts for degradation.
RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) play an important role in many cellular processes. In particular, noncoding RNA-protein interactions (ncRPIs) are involved in various gene regulations and human complex diseases. High-throughput experiments have provided a large number of valuable information about ncRPIs, but these experiments are expensive and timeconsuming. Therefore, some computational approaches have been developed to predict ncRPIs efficiently and effectively.
In this work, we will describe the recent advance of predicting ncRPIs from the following aspects: i) the dataset construction; ii) the sequence and structural feature representation, and iii) the machine learning algorithm.
The current methods have successfully predicted ncRPIs, but most of them trained and tested on the small benchmark datasets derived from ncRNA-protein complexes in PDB database. The generalization performance and robust of these existing methods need to be further improved.
Concomitant with the large numbers of ncRPIs generated by high-throughput technologies, three future directions for predicting ncRPIs with machine learning should be paid attention. One direction is that how to effectively construct the negative sample set. Another is the selection of novel and effective features from the sequences and structures of ncRNAs and proteins. The third is the design of powerful predictor.
Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinases (IP5 2-Ks) are part of a family of enzymes in charge of synthesizing inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) in eukaryotic cells. This protein and its product IP6 present many roles in cells, participating in mRNA export, embryonic development, and apoptosis. We reported previously that the full-length IP5 2-K from Arabidopsis thaliana is a zinc metallo-enzyme, including two separated lobes (the N- and C-lobes). We have also shown conformational changes in IP5 2-K and have identified the residues involved in substrate recognition and catalysis. However, the specific features of mammalian IP5 2-Ks remain unknown. To this end, we report here the first structure for a murine IP5 2-K in complex with ATP/IP5 or IP6 Our structural findings indicated that the general folding in N- and C-lobes is conserved with A. thaliana IP5 2-K. A helical scaffold in the C-lobe constitutes the inositol phosphate-binding site, which, along with the participation of the N-lobe, endows high specificity to this protein. However, we also noted large structural differences between the orthologues from these two eukaryotic kingdoms. These differences include a novel zinc-binding site and regions unique to the mammalian IP5 2-K, as an unexpected basic patch on the protein surface. In conclusion, our findings have uncovered distinct features of a mammalian IP5 2-K and set the stage for investigations into protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions important for IP5 2-K function and activity.
Premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in the ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family A, Member 7 gene (ABCA7) have recently been identified as intermediate-to-high penetrant risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). High variability, however, is observed in downstream ABCA7 mRNA and protein expression, disease penetrance, and onset age, indicative of unknown modifying factors. Here, we investigated the prevalence and disease penetrance of ABCA7 PTC mutations in a large early onset AD (EOAD)-control cohort, and examined the effect on transcript level with comprehensive third-generation long-read sequencing. We characterized the ABCA7 coding sequence with next-generation sequencing in 928 EOAD patients and 980 matched control individuals. With MetaSKAT rare variant association analysis, we observed a fivefold enrichment (p = 0.0004) of PTC mutations in EOAD patients (3%) versus controls (0.6%). Ten novel PTC mutations were only observed in patients, and PTC mutation carriers in general had an increased familial AD load. In addition, we observed nominal risk reducing trends for three common coding variants. Seven PTC mutations were further analyzed using targeted long-read cDNA sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. PTC-containing transcripts for each investigated PTC mutation were observed at varying proportion (5-41% of the total read count), implying incomplete nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Furthermore, we distinguished and phased several previously unknown alternative splicing events (up to 30% of transcripts). In conjunction with PTC mutations, several of these novel ABCA7 isoforms have the potential to rescue deleterious PTC effects. In conclusion, ABCA7 PTC mutations play a substantial role in EOAD, warranting genetic screening of ABCA7 in genetically unexplained patients. Long-read cDNA sequencing revealed both varying degrees of NMD and transcript-modifying events, which may influence ABCA7 dosage, disease severity, and may create opportunities for therapeutic interventions in AD.
Autophagy is an essential catabolic process responsible for recycling of intracellular material and preserving cellular fidelity. Key to the autophagy pathway is the ubiquitin-like conjugation system mediating lipidation of Atg8 proteins and their anchoring to autophagosomal membranes. While regulation of autophagy has been characterized at the level of transcription, protein interactions and post-translational modifications, its translational regulation remains elusive. Here we describe a role for the conserved eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in autophagy. Identified from a high-throughput screen, we find that eIF5A is required for lipidation of LC3B and its paralogs and promotes autophagosome formation. This feature is evolutionarily conserved and results from the translation of the E2-like ATG3 protein. Mechanistically, we identify an amino acid motif in ATG3 causing eIF5A dependency for its efficient translation. Our study identifies eIF5A as a key requirement for autophagosome formation and demonstrates the importance of translation in mediating efficient autophagy.
In aortic vascular smooth muscle (VSM), the canonical Wnt receptor LRP6 inhibits protein arginine (Arg) methylation, a new component of noncanonical Wnt signaling that stimulates nuclear factor of activated T cells (viz NFATc4). To better understand how methylation mediates these actions, MS was performed on VSM cell extracts from control and LRP6-deficient mice. LRP6-dependent Arg methylation was regulated on &gt;500 proteins; only 21 exhibited increased monomethylation (MMA) with concomitant reductions in dimethylation. G3BP1, a known regulator of arteriosclerosis, exhibited a &gt;30-fold increase in MMA in its C-terminal domain. Co-transfection studies confirm that G3BP1 (G3BP is Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein) methylation is inhibited by LRP6 and that G3BP1 stimulates NFATc4 transcription. NFATc4 association with VSM osteopontin (OPN) and alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) chromatin was increased with LRP6 deficiency and reduced with G3BP1 deficiency. G3BP1 activation of NFATc4 mapped to G3BP1 domains supporting interactions with RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), a stimulus for mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) that drives cardiovascular calcification in humans when mutated in Singleton-Merten syndrome (SGMRT2). Gain-of-function SGMRT2/RIG-I mutants increased G3BP1 methylation and synergized with osteogenic transcription factors (Runx2 and NFATc4). A chemical antagonist of G3BP, C108 (C108 is 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-[1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethylidene]hydrazide CAS 15533-09-2), down-regulated RIG-I-stimulated G3BP1 methylation, Wnt/NFAT signaling, VSM TNAP activity, and calcification. G3BP1 deficiency reduced RIG-I protein levels and VSM osteogenic programs. Like G3BP1 and RIG-I deficiency, MAVS deficiency reduced VSM osteogenic signals, including TNAP activity and Wnt5-dependent nuclear NFATc4 levels. Aortic calcium accumulation is decreased in MAVS-deficient LDLR-/- mice fed arteriosclerotic diets. The G3BP1/RIG-I/MAVS relay is a component of Wnt signaling. Targeting this relay may help mitigate arteriosclerosis.
The Poly-A Binding Protein (PABP) is a conserved eukaryotic polypeptide involved in many aspects of mRNA metabolism. During translation initiation, PABP interacts with the translation initiation complex eIF4F and enhances the translation of polyadenylated mRNAs. Schematically, most PABPs can be divided into an N-terminal RNA-binding region, a non-conserved linker segment and the C-terminal MLLE domain. In pathogenic Leishmania protozoans, three PABP homologues have been identified, with the first one (PABP1) targeted by phosphorylation and shown to co-immunoprecipitate with an eIF4F-like complex (EIF4E4/EIF4G3) implicated in translation initiation. Here, PABP1 phosphorylation was shown to be linked to logarithmic cell growth, reminiscent of EIF4E4 phosphorylation, and coincides with polysomal association. Phosphorylation targets multiple serine-proline (SP) or threonine-proline (TP) residues within the PABP1 linker region. This is an essential protein, but phosphorylation is not needed for its association with polysomes or cell viability. Mutations which do impair PABP1 polysomal association and are required for viability do not prevent phosphorylation, although further mutations lead to a presumed inactive protein largely lacking phosphorylated isoforms. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to investigate PABP1 function further, identifying several novel protein partners and the EIF4E4/EIF4G3 complex, but no other eIF4F-like complex or subunit. A novel, direct interaction between PABP1 and EIF4E4 was also investigated and found to be mediated by the PABP1 MLLE binding to PABP Interacting Motifs (PAM2) within the EIF4E4 N-terminus. The results shown here are consistent with phosphorylation of PABP1 being part of a novel pathway controlling its function and possibly translation in Leishmania.
The objective of this study was to consider endocannabinoid system as inflammatory markers in bovine endometrium to better understand the role of this system in regulating many of the functions that are related to inflammatory condition. At day 26 post-partum, fourteen cows were divided into two groups depending on the inflammatory condition: 1- subclinical endometritis (n = 7, with purulent or mucopurulent uterine discharge detectable in the vagina) and 2- healthy (n = 7, No (muco)) purulent discharge. Blood samples were collected at 26 and 30 days relative to calving to determine plasma tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) concentrations; moreover, uterine biopsy was carried out on day 26 post-partum to measure mRNA abundance of TNF, interleukin-1B (IL1B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), endocannabinoid receptor (CNR2), N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPEPLD), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) by real-time PCR. Results showed mean plasma concentrations of TNF and LBP were lower in healthy cows compared to subclinical endometritis cows (p &lt; .05). Relative mRNA expression for NAAA and FAAH was decreased (p &lt; .05), and relative mRNA expression for CNR2 and NAPEPLD increased in cows with subclinical endometritis compared to healthy cows. In conclusion, relative mRNA expression of TNF, IL1B and CXCL8 and plasma concentration of LBP increased during inflammatory condition along with decreased endocannabinoids hydrolyzing enzyme (NAAA and FAAH), increased enzymes that synthesize endocannabinoids (NAPEPLD) and relative gene expression of the endocannabinoid receptor; together, these contribute to increased endocannabinoids levels during inflammation. Overall, we provide evidence that endocannabinoid system is altered in endometrium tissue during inflammation through increased mRNA expression of CNR2 and synthesis enzyme and decreased mRNA expression of hydrolyzing enzymes interfere with pro-cytokine production and signalling, which may interfere with the onset and progression of inflammation.
Downstream of Kinase (DOK) proteins represent a multigenic family of adaptors that includes negative regulators of immune cell signaling. Using phylogenetics and intron/exon structure data, we show here that the seven human DOK genes (DOK1 to DOK7) form three highly divergent groups that emerged before the protostome-deuterostome split: DOK1/2/3, DOK4/5/6, and DOK7. For two of these three groups (DOK1/2/3 and DOK4/5/6), further gene duplications occurred in vertebrates and so while chordates only have three DOK genes, vertebrates have seven DOK genes over the three groups. From our expression analysis in humans, we show that each group of DOK genes has a distinct pattern of expression. The DOK1/2/3 group is immune specific, yet each of the three genes in the group has a distinct pattern of expression in immune cells. This immune specificity could thus be ancestral, with the DOK1/2/3 gene also being immune-related in protostomes. The DOK4/5/6 and DOK7 groups represent genes that are much less expressed in immune system than the DOK1/2/3 group. Interestingly, we identify a novel tyrosine based motif that is specific to the vertebrate DOK4/5/6 sequences. The evolution of the DOK genes is thus marked by a pattern of ancient duplications and functional specializations.
The accurate cleavage of pre-micro(mi)RNAs by Dicer and mi/siRNA guide strand selection are important steps in forming the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The role of Dicer binding partner TRBP in these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we solved the solution structure of the two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) of TRBP in complex with a functionally asymmetric siRNA using NMR, EPR, and single-molecule spectroscopy. We find that siRNA recognition by the dsRBDs is not sequence-specific but rather depends on the RNA shape. The two dsRBDs can swap their binding sites, giving rise to two equally populated, pseudo-symmetrical complexes, showing that TRBP is not a primary sensor of siRNA asymmetry. Using our structure to model a Dicer-TRBP-siRNA ternary complex, we show that TRBP's dsRBDs and Dicer's RNase III domains bind a canonical 19 base pair siRNA on opposite sides, supporting a mechanism whereby TRBP influences Dicer-mediated cleavage accuracy by binding the dsRNA region of the pre-miRNA during Dicer cleavage.
Rbpms (RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing) is a member of the RRM (RNA Recognition Motif) family of RNA-binding proteins, which is expressed as multiple alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different protein isoforms. We have shown earlier that Rbpms expression in the retina is restricted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and have characterized this gene as a marker for RGCs. The aim of this study was to identify isoforms representing Rbpms in human retinas and to analyze its transcriptional regulation. We found that Rbpms is expressed as transcription variants 1 and 3 encoding isoforms A and C, respectively. These isoforms are encoded by the same first 6 exons but have different C-terminal ends encoded by exon 8 in variant 1 and exon 7 in variant 3. Computational analysis of the Rbpms 5' untranslated and flanking regions reveals the presence of three CpG islands and four predicted promoter regions (PPRs). The effect of PPR 1 (- 1672/- 1420) and PPR2 (- 330/- 79) on transcriptional activation was minimal, whereas PPR 3 (- 73/+ 177) and PPR4 (+ 274/+ 524) induced the expression by ~ 7 and ninefold compared to control, respectively. The maximum activity, a 30-fold increase above the control level, was obtained from the construct containing both PPRs 3 and 4. Site-directed mutagenesis of several cis-elements within PPR3 and PPR4 including five for Sp1, one for AP1, and two for NF-kB showed that mutation of the first three and especially the first GC box resulted in a threefold downregulation of gene expression. AP1, NF-kB, and two downstream Sp1 sites had no significant effect on expression level. The possible involvement of the GC box 1 at position - 54 in transcriptional regulation of Rbpms was corroborated by EMSA, which showed formation of a DNA-protein complex in the presence of the oligonucleotide corresponding to this Sp1-binding site.
Polypyrimidine-tract binding proteins (PTBs) are ubiquitous RNA-binding proteins in plants and animals that play diverse role in RNA metabolic processes. PTB proteins bind to target RNAs through motifs rich in cytosine/uracil residues to fine-tune transcript metabolism. Among tuber and root crops, potato has been widely studied to understand the mobile signals that activate tuber development. Potato PTBs, designated as StPTB1 and StPTB6, function in a long-distance transport system by binding to specific mRNAs (StBEL5 and POTH1) to stabilize them and facilitate their movement from leaf to stolon, the site of tuber induction, where they activate tuber and root growth. Storage tubers and root crops are important sustenance food crops grown throughout the world. Despite the availability of genome sequence for sweet potato, cassava, carrot and sugar beet, the molecular mechanism of root-derived storage organ development remains completely unexplored. Considering the pivotal role of PTBs and their target RNAs in potato storage organ development, we propose that a similar mechanism may be prevalent in storage root crops as well.
Through a bioinformatics survey utilizing available genome databases, we identify the orthologues of potato PTB proteins and two phloem-mobile RNAs, StBEL5 and POTH1, in five storage root crops - sweet potato, cassava, carrot, radish and sugar beet. Like potato, PTB1/6 type proteins from these storage root crops contain four conserved RNA Recognition Motifs (characteristic of RNA-binding PTBs) in their protein sequences. Further, 3´ UTR (untranslated region) analysis of BEL5 and POTH1 orthologues revealed the presence of several cytosine/uracil motifs, similar to those present in potato StBEL5 and POTH1 RNAs. Using RT-qPCR assays, we verified the presence of these related transcripts in leaf and root tissues of these five storage root crops. Similar to potato, BEL5-, PTB1/6- and POTH1-like orthologue RNAs from the aforementioned storage root crops exhibited differential accumulation patterns in leaf and storage root tissues.
Our results suggest that the PTB1/6-like orthologues and their putative targets, BEL5- and POTH1-like mRNAs, from storage root crops could interact physically, similar to that in potato, and potentially, could function as key molecular signals controlling storage organ development in root crops.
Arabidopsis ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) plays a critical role in leaf adaxial-abaxial partitioning by repressing expression of the abaxial-determining gene ETTIN/AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ETT/ARF3). We previously reported that six CpG dinucleotides in its exon 6 are thoroughly methylated by METHYLTRASFERASE1, that CpG methylation levels are inversely correlated with ETT/ARF3 transcript levels and that methylation levels at three out of the six CpG dinucleotides are decreased in as2-1. All these imply that AS2 is involved in epigenetic repression of ETT/ARF3 by gene body DNA methylation. The mechanism of the epigenetic repression by AS2, however, is unknown. Here, we tested mutations of NUCLEOLIN1 (NUC1) and RNA HELICASE10 (RH10) encoding nucleolus-localized proteins for the methylation in exon 6 as these mutations enhance the level of ETT/ARF3 transcripts in as2-1. Methylation levels at three specific CpGs were decreased in rh10-1, and two of those three overlapped with those in as2-1. Methylation levels at two specific CpGs were decreased in nuc1-1, and one of those three overlapped with that in as2-1. No site was affected by both rh10-1 and nuc1-1. One specific CpG was unaffected by these mutations. These results imply that the way in which RH10, NUC1 and AS2 are involved in maintaining methylation at five CpGs in exon 6 might be through at least several independent pathways, which might interact with each other. Furthermore, we found that AS2 binds specifically the sequence containing CpGs in exon 1 of ETT/ARF3, and that the binding requires the zinc-finger-like motif in AS2 that is structurally similar to the zinc finger-CxxC domain in vertebrate DNA methyltransferase1.
The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying congenital obstructive nephropathy (CON).
The microarray dataset GSE70879 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, including 3 kidney samples of megabladder mice and 4 control kidneys. Using this dataset, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified between the kidney samples from megabladder mice and controls, followed by identification of the target genes for these DEMs and construction of a DEM and target gene interaction network. Additionally, the target genes were subjected to Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, and were used for construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, regulatory networks were constructed to analyze transcription factors for the key miRNAs.
From 17 DEMs identified between kidney samples of megabladder mice and controls, 3 key miRNAs were screened, including mmu-miR-150-5p, mmu-miR-374b-5p and mmu-miR-126a-5p. The regulatory networks identified vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) as the common target gene of mmu-miR-150-5p and five transcription factors, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (Nr4a2), Jun dimerisation protein 2 (Jdp2), Kruppel-like factor 6 (Klf6), Neurexophilin-3 (Nxph3) and RNA binding motif protein 17 (Rbm17). The gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) was found to be co-regulated by mmu-miR-374b-5p and high mobility group protein A1 (Hmga1), whereas the kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (Kras) was identified as a common target gene of mmu-miR-126a-5p and paired box 6 (Pax6).
In summary, the above-listed key miRNAs, transcription factors and key genes may be involved in the development of CON.
Although stop codon readthrough is used extensively by viruses to expand their gene expression, verified instances of mammalian readthrough have only recently been uncovered by systems biology and comparative genomics approaches. Previously, our analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons predicted stop codon readthrough of several mammalian genes, all of which have been validated experimentally. Four mRNAs display highly efficient stop codon readthrough, and these mRNAs have a UGA stop codon immediately followed by CUAG (UGA_CUAG) that is conserved throughout vertebrates. Extending on the identification of this readthrough motif, we here investigated stop codon readthrough, using tissue culture reporter assays, for all previously untested human genes containing UGA_CUAG. The readthrough efficiency of the annotated stop codon for the sequence encoding vitamin D receptor (VDR) was 6.7%. It was the highest of those tested but all showed notable levels of readthrough. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors, and it binds its major ligand, calcitriol, via its C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Readthrough of the annotated VDR mRNA results in a 67 amino acid-long C-terminal extension that generates a VDR proteoform named VDRx. VDRx may form homodimers and heterodimers with VDR but, compared with VDR, VDRx displayed a reduced transcriptional response to calcitriol even in the presence of its partner retinoid X receptor.
Human hnRNP A2/B1 is an RNA-binding protein that plays important roles in many biological processes, including maturation, transport, and metabolism of mRNA, and gene regulation of long noncoding RNAs. hnRNP A2/B1 was reported to control the microRNAs sorting to exosomes and promote primary microRNA processing as a potential m6A "reader." hnRNP A2/B1 contains two RNA recognition motifs that provide sequence-specific recognition of RNA substrates. Here, we determine crystal structures of tandem RRM domains of hnRNP A2/B1 in complex with various RNA substrates, elucidating specific recognitions of AGG and UAG motifs by RRM1 and RRM2 domains, respectively. Further structural and biochemical results demonstrate multivariant binding modes for sequence-diversified RNA substrates, supporting a RNA matchmaker mechanism in hnRNP A2/B1 function. Moreover, our studies in combination with bioinformatic analysis suggest that hnRNP A2/B1 may mediate effects of m6A through a "m6A switch" mechanism, instead of acting as a direct "reader" of m6A modification.
A characteristic feature of archaeal ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNAs is that they have extended helices P12.1 and P12.2 containing kink-turn (K-turn) motifs to which the archaeal RNase P protein Rpp38, a homologue of the human RNase P protein Rpp38, specifically binds. PhoRpp38 from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii is involved in the elevation of the optimum temperature of the reconstituted RNase P by binding the K-turns in P12.1 and P12.2. Previously, the crystal structure of PhoRpp38 in complex with the K-turn in P12.2 was determined at 3.4 Å resolution. In this study, the crystal structure of PhoRpp38 in complex with the K-turn in P12.2 was improved to 2.1 Å resolution and the structure of PhoRpp38 in complex with the K-turn in P12.1 was also determined at a resolution of 3.1 Å. Both structures revealed that Lys35, Asn38 and Glu39 in PhoRpp38 interact with characteristic G·A and A·G pairs in the K-turn, while Thr37, Asp59, Lys84, Glu94, Ala96 and Ala98 in PhoRpp38 interact with the three-nucleotide bulge in the K-turn. Moreover, an extended stem-loop containing P10-P12.2 in complex with PhoRpp38, as well as PhoRpp21 and PhoRpp29, which are the archaeal homologues of the human proteins Rpp21 and Rpp29, respectively, was affinity-purified and crystallized. The crystals thus grown diffracted to a resolution of 6.35 Å. Structure determination of the crystals will demonstrate the previously proposed secondary structure of stem-loops including helices P12.1 and P12.2 and will also provide insight into the structural organization of the specificity domain in P. horikoshii RNase P RNA.
Human syncytial respiratory virus is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus with serious implications for respiratory disease in infants, and has recently been reclassified into a new family, Pneumoviridae. One of the main reasons for this classification is the unique presence of a transcriptional antiterminator, called M2-1. The puzzling mechanism of action of M2-1, which is a rarity among antiterminators in viruses and is part of the RNA polymerase complex, relies on dissecting the structure and function of this multidomain tetramer. The RNA-binding activity is located in a monomeric globular `core' domain, a high-resolution crystal structure of which is now presented. The structure reveals a compact domain which is superimposable on the full-length M2-1 tetramer, with additional electron density for the C-terminal tail that was not observed in the previous models. Moreover, its folding stability was determined through chemical denaturation, which shows that the secondary and tertiary structure unfold concomitantly, which is indicative of a two-state equilibrium. These results constitute a further step in the understanding of this unique RNA-binding domain, for which there is no sequence or structural counterpart outside this virus family, in addition to its implications in transcription regulation and its likeliness as an antiviral target.
The guanine-rich RNA sequence binding factor 1 (GRSF1) constitutes an ubiquitously occurring RNA-binding protein (RBP), which belongs to the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F/H (hnRNP F/H). It has been implicated in nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial RNA metabolism. Although the crystal structures of GRSF1 orthologs have not been solved, amino acid alignments with similar RNA-binding proteins suggested the existence of three RNA-binding domains designated quasi-RNA recognition motifs (qRRMs). Here we established 3D-models for the three qRRMs of human GRSF1 on the basis of the NMR structure of hnRNP F and identified the putative RNA interacting amino acids. Next, we explored the genetic variability of the three qRRMs of human GRSF1 by searching genomic databases and tested the functional consequences of naturally occurring mutants. For this purpose the RNA-binding capacity of wild-type and mutant recombinant GRSF1 protein species was assessed by quantitative RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We found that some of the naturally occurring GRSF1 mutants exhibited a strongly reduced RNA-binding activity although the general protein structure was hardly affected. These data suggested that homozygous allele carriers of these particular mutants express dysfunctional GRSF1 and thus may show defective GRSF1 signaling.
Antibody fragments such as Fabs possess properties that can enhance protein and RNA crystallization and therefore can facilitate macromolecular structure determination. In particular, Fab BL3-6 binds to an AAACA RNA pentaloop closed by a GC pair with ∼100 nM affinity. The Fab and hairpin have served as a portable module for RNA crystallization. The potential for general application make it desirable to adjust the properties of this crystallization module in a manner that facilitates its use for RNA structure determination, such as ease of purification, surface entropy or binding affinity. In this work, we used both in vitro RNA selection and phage display selection to alter the epitope and paratope sides of the binding interface, respectively, for improved binding affinity. We identified a 5'-GNGACCC-3' consensus motif in the RNA and S97N mutation in complimentarity determining region L3 of the Fab that independently impart about an order of magnitude improvement in affinity, resulting from new hydrogen bonding interactions. Using a model RNA, these modifications facilitated crystallization under a wider range of conditions and improved diffraction. The improved features of the Fab-RNA module may facilitate its use as an affinity tag for RNA purification and imaging and as a chaperone for RNA crystallography.
The muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of proteins are key developmental regulators of alternative splicing. Sequestration of MBNL proteins by expanded CUG/CCUG repeat RNA transcripts is a major pathogenic mechanism in the neuromuscular disorder myotonic dystrophy (DM). MBNL1 contains four zinc finger (ZF) motifs that form two tandem RNA binding domains (ZF1-2 and ZF3-4) which each bind YGCY RNA motifs. In an effort to determine the differences in function between these domains, we designed and characterized synthetic MBNL proteins with duplicate ZF1-2 or ZF3-4 domains, referred to as MBNL-AA and MBNL-BB, respectively. Analysis of splicing regulation revealed that MBNL-AA had up to 5-fold increased splicing activity while MBNL-BB had 4-fold decreased activity compared to a MBNL protein with the canonical arrangement of zinc finger domains. RNA binding analysis revealed that the variations in splicing activity are due to differences in RNA binding specificities between the two ZF domains rather than binding affinity. Our findings indicate that ZF1-2 drives splicing regulation via recognition of YGCY RNA motifs while ZF3-4 acts as a general RNA binding domain. Our studies suggest that synthetic MBNL proteins with improved or altered splicing activity have the potential to be used as both tools for investigating splicing regulation and protein therapeutics for DM and other microsatellite diseases.
The Guanine-rich RNA sequence binding factor 1 (GRSF1) is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F/H family and has been implicated in RNA processing, RNA transport and translational regulation. Amino acid alignments and homology modeling suggested the existence of three distinct RNA-binding domains and two auxiliary domains. Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular details of GRSF1/RNA interactions. To explore the RNA-binding mechanisms we first expressed full-length human GRSF1 and several truncation mutants, which include the three separated qRRM domains in E. coli, purified the recombinant proteins and quantified their RNA-binding affinity by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The expression levels varied between 1 and 10mg purified protein per L bacterial liquid culture and for full-length human GRSF1 a binding constant (KD-value) of 0.5μM was determined. In addition, our mechanistic experiments with different truncation mutants allowed the following conclusions: i) Deletion of either of the three RNA-binding domains impaired the RNA-binding affinity suggesting that the simultaneous presence of the three domains is essential for high-affinity RNA-binding. ii) Deletion of the Ala-rich auxiliary domain did hardly affect RNA-binding. Thus, this structural subunit may not be involved in RNA interaction. iii) Deletion of the acidic auxiliary domain improved the RNA-binding suggesting a regulatory role for this structural motif. iv) The isolated RNA-binding domains did not exhibit sizeable RNA-binding affinities. Taken together these data suggest that a cooperative interaction of the three qRRMs is required for high affinity RNA-binding.
3' polyadenylation is a key step in eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis. In mammalian cells, this process is dependent on the recognition of the hexanucleotide AAUAAA motif in the pre-mRNA polyadenylation signal by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. A core CPSF complex comprising CPSF160, WDR33, CPSF30 and Fip1 is sufficient for AAUAAA motif recognition, yet the molecular interactions underpinning its assembly and mechanism of PAS recognition are not understood. Based on cross-linking-coupled mass spectrometry, crystal structure of the CPSF160-WDR33 subcomplex and biochemical assays, we define the molecular architecture of the core human CPSF complex, identifying specific domains involved in inter-subunit interactions. In addition to zinc finger domains in CPSF30, we identify using quantitative RNA-binding assays an N-terminal lysine/arginine-rich motif in WDR33 as a critical determinant of specific AAUAAA motif recognition. Together, these results shed light on the function of CPSF in mediating PAS-dependent RNA cleavage and polyadenylation.
Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are restriction factors that inhibit the infectious entry of many enveloped RNA viruses. However, we demonstrated previously that human IFITM2 and IFITM3 are essential host factors facilitating the entry of human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43. In a continuing effort to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying IFITM differential modulation of HCoV entry, we investigated the roles of structural motifs important for IFITM protein posttranslational modifications, intracellular trafficking, and oligomerization in modulating the entry of five HCoVs. We found that three distinct mutations in IFITM1 or IFITM3 converted the host restriction factors to enhance entry driven by the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and/or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). First, replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine 20 with either alanine or aspartic acid to mimic unphosphorylated or phosphorylated IFITM3 reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63 and -229E but enhanced the entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Second, replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine 99 with either alanine or aspartic acid reduced its activity to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV but promoted the entry of MERS-CoV. Third, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acid residues from IFITM1 enhanced the entry of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. These findings suggest that these residues and structural motifs of IFITM proteins are key determinants for modulating the entry of HCoVs, most likely through interaction with viral and/or host cellular components at the site of viral entry to modulate the fusion of viral envelope and cellular membranes.IMPORTANCE The differential effects of IFITM proteins on the entry of HCoVs that utilize divergent entry pathways and membrane fusion mechanisms even when using the same receptor make the HCoVs a valuable system for comparative investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying IFITM restriction or promotion of virus entry into host cells. Identification of three distinct mutations that converted IFITM1 or IFITM3 from inhibitors to enhancers of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV spike protein-mediated entry revealed key structural motifs or residues determining the biological activities of IFITM proteins. These findings have thus paved the way for further identification of viral and host factors that interact with those structural motifs of IFITM proteins to differentially modulate the infectious entry of HCoVs.
In previous studies, we showed that the cellular RNA-binding protein AUF1 supports the replication process of the flavivirus West Nile virus. Here we demonstrate that the protein also enables effective proliferation of dengue virus and Zika virus, indicating that AUF1 is a general flavivirus host factor. Further studies demonstrated that the AUF1 isoform p45 significantly stimulates the initiation of viral RNA replication and that the protein's RNA chaperone activity enhances the interactions of the viral 5'UAR and 3'UAR genome cyclization sequences. Most interestingly, we observed that AUF1 p45 destabilizes not only the 3'-terminal stem-loop (3'SL) but also 5'-terminal stem-loop B (SLB) of the viral genome. RNA structure analyses revealed that AUF1 p45 increases the accessibility of defined nucleotides within the 3'SL and SLB and, in this way, exposes both UAR cyclization elements. Conversely, AUF1 p45 does not modulate the fold of stem-loop A (SLA) at the immediate genomic 5' end, which is proposed to function as a promoter of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). These findings suggest that AUF1 p45, by destabilizing specific stem-loop structures within the 5' and 3' ends of the flaviviral genome, assists genome cyclization and concurrently enables the RdRp to initiate RNA synthesis. Our study thus highlights the role of a cellular RNA-binding protein inducing a flaviviral RNA switch that is crucial for viral replication.IMPORTANCE The genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae family includes important human pathogens, such as dengue, West Nile, and Zika viruses. The initiation of replication of the flaviviral RNA genome requires a transformation from a linear to a cyclized form. This involves considerable structural reorganization of several RNA motifs at the genomic 5' and 3' ends. Specifically, it needs a melting of stem structures to expose complementary 5' and 3' cyclization elements to enable their annealing during cyclization. Here we show that a cellular RNA chaperone, AUF1 p45, which supports the replication of all three aforementioned flaviviruses, specifically rearranges stem structures at both ends of the viral genome and in this way permits 5'-3' interactions of cyclization elements. Thus, AUF1 p45 triggers the RNA switch in the flaviviral genome that is crucial for viral replication. These findings represent an important example of how cellular (host) factors promote the propagation of RNA viruses.
To determine whether B lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Pax5 regulates B-lympho-magenesis without direct binding to promoter.
Mouse B-lymphoma cell line myc3 and 38B9 were infected with GFP- tagged retrovirus that encodes wide type or various mutant pax5 genes. After viral infection for 48 hours, the percentage of GFP positive lymphoma cells was determined by flow cytomety. The percentage of GFP positive tumor cells was further monitored every 3 days in vitro or once the tumor was formed in vivo. Both cell cycle and apoptic cell number of GFP positive lymphoma cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.
Similar to the infection with wild type Pax5 retrovirus, infection with Pax5 mt 1-357 and Pax5 mt 304-358 that lacks of DNA binding motif can strongly increase the percentage of GFP+ B-lymphoma cells both in vitro and in vivo (P&lt;0.01), while infection with empty viral vector migR-GFP and Pax5 mt 1-143 containing only DNA binding motif failed to increase the percentage of GFP positive tumor cells (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, the analysis of flow cytometry demonstrated that more B-lymphoma cells infected with wild type Pax5, Pax5 mt 1-357 and Pax5 mt 304-358 retroviruses entered S and G2/M phases in comparison with those infected with empty viral vector migR-GFP and Pax5 mt 1-143. Apoptotic rates among different groups were not significantly changed.
Pax5 can promote B-lymphoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo in a promoter-independent manner. This is mainly due to the accelerating of cell cycle rather than decreasing apoptosis. Our studies provide potential theory for restraing B-lymphomagenesis by targeting the specific Pax5 domains.
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key chromatin modifier responsible for methylation of lysine 27 in histone H3. PRC2 has been shown to interact with thousands of RNA species in vivo, but understanding the physiological function of RNA binding has been hampered by the lack of separation-of-function mutants. Here, we use comprehensive mutagenesis and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to identify critical residues for RNA interaction in PRC2 core complexes from Homo sapiens and Chaetomium thermophilum, for which crystal structures are known. Preferential binding of G-quadruplex RNA is conserved, surprisingly using different protein elements. Key RNA-binding residues are spread out along the surface of EZH2, with other subunits including EED also contributing, and missense mutations of some of these residues have been found in cancer patients. The unusual nature of this protein-RNA interaction provides a paradigm for other epigenetic modifiers that bind RNA without canonical RNA-binding motifs.
It has been reported that the innate immune response plays important roles in brain ischemia and that the infiltration of blood-derived immune cells is a key initiator of this response. Nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin 1, Ninj1) is a cell adhesion molecule responsible for cell-to-cell interactions between immune cells and endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the proinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of Ninj1 and a dodecamer peptide harboring Ninj1 N-terminal adhesion motif (N-NAM, Pro26~Asn37) in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke. Ninj1 was predominantly induced in neutrophils and endothelial cells in the ischemic hemispheres around 12 h to 1 day post-MCAO, which coincided with a massive neutrophil influx. We demonstrated that intranasal administration of Ninj1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or N-NAM significantly blocked neutrophil infiltration in postischemic brains. In addition, intranasal administration of Ninj1 siRNA or N-NAM reduced the mean infarct volume to 46.5 ± 9.2 or 30.6 ± 11.7% of that of the PBS-treated MCAO controls, respectively, which was accompanied by significant amelioration of neurological and motor deficits. We showed that N-NAM or Ninj1 siRNA effectively blocked the adhesion and transendothelial migration of TNF-α-stimulated human myelocytic leukemia cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and similarly suppressed adhesion and migration of monocytes. Activations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 are involved in these Ninj1-mediated processes and can be inhibited by N-NAM or Ninj1 siRNA. These results indicate that Ninj1 plays an important role in neutrophil infiltration in the postischemic brain and N-NAM confers robust neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting Ninj1-mediated infiltration of neutrophils.
Antimicrobial peptides are short peptides secreted by the innate immune system to protect the host from pathogens. We have investigated the influence of the amino terminal copper and nickel binding (ATCUN) motif on derivatives of ovispirin-3 (OV-3), an α-helical peptide from the cathelicidin family, demonstrating an increased antimicrobial activity toward a broad range of bacteria, relative to OV-3, with MICs as low as 1.3 ± 0.6 μM. Each peptide was able to bind DNA and RNA with micromolar affinity, but did not display nuclease activity in vivo. The ATCUN OV-3 derivatives also displayed an increased membrane leakage and lipid peroxidation relative to Cu-GGH and OV-3 alone. These data suggest that the Cu-ATCUN derivatives inhibit bacteria by binding to the membrane, promoting oxidative damage of the lipids, which then disrupts the bilayer, resulting in cell death. This stands in contrast to the mode of action of OV-3 alone, which permeabilizes the membrane without lipid oxidation.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by RNA viruses represent a unique class of nucleic acid polymerases. Unlike other classes of single-subunit polymerases, viral RdRPs have evolved a unique conformational change in their palm domain to close the active site during catalysis. The hallmark of this conformational change is the backbone shift of the polymerase motif A from an "open" state to a "closed" state, allowing two universally conserved aspartic acid residues to orient toward each other for divalent metal binding and catalysis. The "closed" motif A conformation was only observed upon the binding of correct NTP in RdRP catalytic complexes or under rare conditions such as induced by a bound lutetium ion or a bound glutamate molecule. By solving the crystal structure of the catalytic elongation complex of the coxsackievirus RdRP, we in this work observed for the first time the "closed" motif A conformation in the absence of an NTP substrate or other conformational-change-inducing factors. This observation emphasizes the intrinsic dynamic features of viral RdRP motif A, and solidifies the structural basis for how this important structural element participates in catalytic events of the RdRPs.
Epitranscriptomic RNA modifications can regulate mRNA function; however, there is a major gap in our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms mediating their effects. Here, we develop a chemical proteomics approach relying upon photo-cross-linking with synthetic diazirine-containing RNA probes and quantitative proteomics to profile RNA-protein interactions regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic RNA. In addition to identifying YTH domain-containing proteins and ALKBH5, known interactors of this modification, we find that FMR1 and LRPPRC, two proteins associated with human disease, "read" this modification. Surprisingly, we also find that m6A disrupts RNA binding by the stress granule proteins G3BP1/2, USP10, CAPRIN1, and RBM42. Our work provides a general strategy for interrogating the interactome of RNA modifications and reveals the biochemical mechanisms underlying m6A function in the cell.
Gonadotropins and growth factors synergistically regulate folliculogenesis and oocyte development. C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 are expressed in ovaries of sheep, cattle and other species, however, roles of this multifunctional signal axis in oocyte maturation are not defined. Using sheep as a model, we examined the expression patterns and functions of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis during oocyte maturation. CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein were present in oocytes and granulosa cells. Relative abundance of CXCR4 transcript was controlled by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Transient inhibition of CXCR4 suppressed oocyte nuclear maturation while supplementing recombination CXCL12 significantly increased percent of oocyte undergone metaphase I phase. Inhibition of CXCR4 function decreased cumulus expansion growth rate. Furthermore, granulosa cell migration was impaired and expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and hyaluronan binding protein tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6) were downregulated by CXCR4 inhibition. These findings revealed a novel role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in oocyte development in sheep.
Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I, are crucial for host recognition of non-self RNAs, especially viral RNA. Thus, the expression and activation of RLRs play fundamental roles in eliminating the invading RNA viruses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, how RLR expression is tightly regulated remains to be further investigated. In this study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded gene, tripartite interaction motif 40 (TRIM40), as a suppressor of RLR signaling by directly targeting MDA5 and RIG-I. TRIM40 binds to MDA5 and RIG-I and promotes their K27- and K48-linked polyubiquitination via its E3 ligase activity, leading to their proteasomal degradation. TRIM40 deficiency enhances RLR-triggered signaling. Consequently, TRIM40 deficiency greatly enhances antiviral immune responses and decreases viral replication in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM40 limits RLR-triggered innate activation, suggesting TRIM40 as a potential therapeutic target for the control of viral infection.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 180 million people worldwide. Significant progress has been made since the establishment of in vitro HCV infection models in cells. However, the replication of HCV is complex and not completely understood. Here, we found that the expression of host prion protein (PrP) was induced in an HCV replication cell model. We then showed that increased PrP expression facilitated HCV genomic replication. Finally, we demonstrated that the KKRPK motif on the N-terminus of PrP bound nucleic acids and facilitated HCV genomic replication. Our results provided important insights into how viruses may harness cellular protein to achieve propagation.
Thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is usually attributed to impaired marrow production resulting from cytotoxic drug use or CMML itself ("CMML-induced thrombocytopenia"). In very rare cases, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be a complication of CMML ("CMML-associated ITP"). However, treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with CMML is still a challenge.
Case 1 was a 61-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital because of skin petechiae and purpura for 6 days. She had increased monocyte cell count (1.82 × 10/L), markedly decreased platelet count (2 × 10/L), hypercellularity of the megakaryocyte lineage with many immature megakaryocytes, and ZRSR2(zinc finger CCCH-type, RNA binding motif and serine/arginine rich 2) mutation. She failed to the treatment of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), TPO (thrombopoietin), and cyclosporin A (CsA). Case 2 was a 72-year-old female patient with thrombocytosis and monocytosis for 4 years, and thrombocytopenia for 6 months. After 10 courses of decitabine therapy, she had a persistent severe thrombocytopenia and decreased number of megakaryocytes, TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) and SRSF2 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) mutations were detected. She was dependent on platelet transfusion.
Case 1 was diagnosed as CMML-associated ITP, and case 2 as CMML with decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia.
Both patients were treated with eltrombopag.
In both patients, the platelet counts returned to the normal within 1 week after eltrombopag therapy. The platelet count in case 1 patient remained stable at 141-200 × 10/L for 20 months with stopping therapy for 3 months. In case 2 patient, eltrombopag was stopped 1 month later. Her platelet count decreased to 41 × 10/L, but was stable at ∼30 × 10/L for 3 months with platelet transfusion independency for 12 months. Both patients had no adverse effects with eltrombopag.
CMML-associated ITP is very rare and easily misdiagnosed. To the best of our knowledge, case 1 is the first reported case of the successful treatment of CMML-associated ITP with eltrombopag. Both CMML-associated ITP and decitabine therapy-induced thrombocytopenia in these 2 patients were highly sensitive and safe to eltrombopag therapy.
Angiotensin II is thought to participate in aneurysm formation, because of its ability to induce and perpetuate inflammation in the aortic wall. Because activation of renin is the first step of the renin-angiotensin system, renin inhibition could inhibit all components of this system effectively. Therefore, we examined the hypothesis that direct inhibition of renin activity could decrease the expansion of aortic aneurysm using a rabbit model. Aortic dilatation was induced by incubation with elastase around the rabbit abdominal aorta. Continuous administration of a direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, was started at 1 week before incubation with elastase and continued for 5 weeks. Treatment with aliskiren markedly inhibited tissue renin activation and resulted in a significant reduction in angiotensin I and II production in the aneurysm wall. Consequently, the inhibition of renin activity prevented the expansion of experimental aortic aneurysm associated with preservation of the medial layer, independent of its blood pressure-lowering effect. Administration of aliskiren led to the inhibition of activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), AP-1 (activator protein-1), and CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), which are thought to cooperatively regulate the inflammatory gene expression profile associated with aneurysm formation. As a result, treatment with aliskiren inhibited macrophage accumulation through suppression of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and CCL4 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 4) expression, and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) production and activation of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2) and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) were also suppressed in the aneurysm wall. In addition, inhibition of (pro)renin receptor elevation was also observed after treatment with aliskiren. Direct inhibition of renin activity using aliskiren prevented the progression of aortic aneurysm, suggesting it as a therapeutic option to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm.
In this study, we aimed to clinically and genetically characterize LVNC patients and investigate the prevalence of variants in known and novel LVNC disease genes.
Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure, arrhythmia, thromboembolism, and sudden cardiac death. We sought here to dissect its genetic causes, phenotypic presentation and outcome.
In our registry with follow-up of in the median 61 months, we analysed 95 LVNC patients (68 unrelated index patients and 27 affected relatives; definite familial LVNC = 23.5%) by cardiac phenotyping, molecular biomarkers and exome sequencing. Cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in LVNC patients compared with an age-matched group of patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio = 2.481, P = 0.002). Stringent genetic classification according to ACMG guidelines revealed that TTN, LMNA, and MYBPC3 are the most prevalent disease genes (13 patients are carrying a pathogenic truncating TTN variant, odds ratio = 40.7, Confidence interval = 21.6-76.6, P &lt; 0.0001, percent spliced in 76-100%). We also identified novel candidate genes for LVNC. For RBM20, we were able to perform detailed familial, molecular and functional studies. We show that the novel variant p.R634L in the RS domain of RBM20 co-segregates with LVNC, leading to titin mis-splicing as revealed by RNA sequencing of heart tissue in mutation carriers, protein analysis, and functional splice-reporter assays.
Our data demonstrate that the clinical course of symptomatic LVNC can be severe. The identified pathogenic variants and distribution of disease genes-a titin-related pathomechanism is found in every fourth patient-should be considered in genetic counselling of patients. Pathogenic variants in the nuclear proteins Lamin A/C and RBM20 were associated with worse outcome.
Expression of inflammatory genes is determined in part by post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA metabolism but how stimulus- and transcript-dependent nuclear export influence is poorly understood. Here, we report a novel pathway in which LPS/TLR4 engagement promotes nuclear localization of IRAK2 to facilitate nuclear export of a specific subset of inflammation-related mRNAs for translation in murine macrophages. IRAK2 kinase activity is required for LPS-induced RanBP2-mediated IRAK2 sumoylation and subsequent nuclear translocation. Array analysis showed that an SRSF1-binding motif is enriched in mRNAs dependent on IRAK2 for nuclear export. Nuclear IRAK2 phosphorylates SRSF1 to reduce its binding to target mRNAs, which promotes the RNA binding of the nuclear export adaptor ALYREF and nuclear export receptor Nxf1 loading for the export of the mRNAs. In summary, LPS activates a nuclear function of IRAK2 that facilitates the assembly of nuclear export machinery to export selected inflammatory mRNAs to the cytoplasm for translation.
Gram‑negative (GN) bacterial infection is a main cause of bovine mastitis. The cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 gene serves an essential role in GN bacterium‑induced innate immune response. CD14 works as a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, combines with LPS‑liposaccharide binding protein complex, and causes cellular activation. However, the effects of CD14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on morbidity of clinical mastitis remain unclear. In the present study, To investigate the polymorphisms of CD14 gene and its effects on cows' susceptibility to mastitis, polymerase chain reaction‑single‑strand conformation polymorphism (PCR‑SSCP) assay was used to detect SNPs of CD14 gene in 134 Chinese Holsteins. SNPs were identified in PCR products amplified with 3 sets of primers in CD14 exon 2. A total of three SNPs were located in that exon: g.528 A→C (147Ser→Arg) in allele B; g.612 A→G (175Asn→Asp) in allele D; and g.1022 A→G in allele F (synonymous mutation). The SNPs in alleles B and D affected the secondary structure of CD14. A 3‑dimensional (3D) structural analysis predicted three potential protein forms with a similar structure and indicated that the changes of the above‑mentioned alleles were on the concave surface of the protein. In more detail, 147 Ser→Arg induced a protein kinase C phosphorylation site to move forward, as assessed by the motif analysis. The morbidity rate of AB (mixed type g.528 A/C) and CD (mixed type g.612 A/G) was the highest among all genotypes presented in the current study, and via of tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6 mRNA levels were upregulated in animals of this genotype compared with others. Taken together, the CD14 SNPs identified in the present study, may be closely associated with the morbidity of mastitis.
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant base modification found in messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The discovery of FTO as the first m6A mRNA demethylase established the concept of reversible RNA modification. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of RNA demethylation and uncover FTO as a potent regulator of nuclear mRNA processing events such as alternative splicing and 3΄ end mRNA processing. We show that FTO binds preferentially to pre-mRNAs in intronic regions, in the proximity of alternatively spliced (AS) exons and poly(A) sites. FTO knockout (KO) results in substantial changes in pre-mRNA splicing with prevalence of exon skipping events. The alternative splicing effects of FTO KO anti-correlate with METTL3 knockdown suggesting the involvement of m6A. Besides, deletion of intronic region that contains m6A-linked DRACH motifs partially rescues the FTO KO phenotype in a reporter system. All together, we demonstrate that the splicing effects of FTO are dependent on the catalytic activity in vivo and are mediated by m6A. Our results reveal for the first time the dynamic connection between FTO RNA binding and demethylation activity that influences several mRNA processing events.
Stress granules (SG) are membrane-less organelles that are condensates of stalled translation initiation complexes and mRNAs. SG formation is a cytoprotective response to environmental stress and results from protein interactions involving regions of low amino acid complexity and poorly defined post-translational modifications of SG components. Many RNA-binding proteins are methylated, and we previously demonstrated that the potent SG-nucleating protein G3BP1 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 and 5 (PRMT1 and PRMT5). G3BP1 methylation represses SG formation and is reversible. Here we functionally link JMJD6 (Jumonji C domain-containing protein 6) to G3BP1 demethylation. Our findings reveal that JMJD6 is a novel SG component that interacts with G3BP1 complexes, and its expression reduces G3BP1 monomethylation and asymmetric dimethylation at three Arg residues. Knockdown of JMJD6 repressed SG formation and G3BP1 demethylation, but SG formation and G3BP1 demethylation were rescued with catalytically active but not mutant JMJD6. These results suggest that JMJD6 functions directly or indirectly as an arginine demethylase of G3BP1 that promotes SG formation.
Endosomal recycling of transmembrane proteins requires sequence-dependent recognition of motifs present within their intracellular cytosolic domains. In this study, we have reexamined the role of retromer in the sequence-dependent endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) transport of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Although the knockdown or knockout of retromer does not perturb CI-MPR transport, the targeting of the retromer-linked sorting nexin (SNX)-Bin, Amphiphysin, and Rvs (BAR) proteins leads to a pronounced defect in CI-MPR endosome-to-TGN transport. The retromer-linked SNX-BAR proteins comprise heterodimeric combinations of SNX1 or SNX2 with SNX5 or SNX6 and serve to regulate the biogenesis of tubular endosomal sorting profiles. We establish that SNX5 and SNX6 associate with the CI-MPR through recognition of a specific WLM endosome-to-TGN sorting motif. From validating the CI-MPR dependency of SNX1/2-SNX5/6 tubular profile formation, we provide a mechanism for coupling sequence-dependent cargo recognition with the biogenesis of tubular profiles required for endosome-to-TGN transport. Therefore, the data presented in this study reappraise retromer's role in CI-MPR transport.
Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is an endoribonuclease involved in maturation of the 5'-end of tRNA. We found previously that RNase P in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 consists of a catalytic RNase P RNA (PhopRNA) and five protein cofactors designated PhoPop5, PhoRpp21, PhoRpp29, PhoRpp30, and PhoRpp38. The crystal structures of the five proteins have been determined, a three-dimensional (3-D) model of PhopRNA has been constructed, and biochemical data, including protein-RNA interaction sites, have become available. Here, this information was combined to orient the crystallographic structures of the proteins relative to their RNA binding sites in the PhopRNA model. Some alterations were made to the PhopRNA model to improve the fit. In the resulting structure, a heterotetramer composed of PhoPop5 and PhoRpp30 bridges helices P3 and P16 in the PhopRNA C-domain, thereby probably stabilizing a double-stranded RNA structure (helix P4) containing catalytic Mg2+ ions, while a heterodimer of PhoRpp21 and PhoRpp29 locates on a single-stranded loop connecting helices P11 and P12 in the specificity domain (S-domain) in PhopRNA, probably forming an appropriate conformation of the precursor tRNA (pre-tRNA) binding site. The fifth protein PhoRpp38 binds each kink-turn (K-turn) motif in helices P12.1, P12.2, and P16 in PhopRNA. Comparison of the structure of the resulting 3-D model with that of bacterial RNase P suggests transition from RNA-RNA interactions in bacterial RNase P to protein-RNA interactions in archaeal RNase P. The proposed 3-D model of P. horikoshii RNase P will serve as a framework for further structural and functional studies on archaeal, as well as eukaryotic, RNase Ps.
Fusarium mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN), common contaminants in the feed of farm animals, cause immune function impairment and organ inflammation. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to elucidate DON and ZEN effects on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune related genes in the kidneys of piglets.
Fifteen 6-week-old piglets were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments for 4 weeks: control diet, and diets contaminated with either 8 mg DON/kg feed or 0.8 mg ZEN/kg feed. Kidney samples were collected after treatment, and RNA-seq was used to investigate the effects on immune-related genes and gene networks.
A total of 186 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened (120 upregulated and 66 downregulated). Gene ontology analysis revealed that the immune response, and cellular and metabolic processes were significantly controlled by these DEGs. The inflammatory stimulation might be an effect of the following enriched Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis found related to immune and disease responses: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and chemical carcinogenesis. The effects of DON and ZEN on genome-wide expression were assessed, and it was found that the DEGs associated with inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 10 receptor, beta, chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 9, CXCL10, chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 4), proliferation (insulin like growth factor binding protein 4, IgG heavy chain, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C, cytochrome P450 1A1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family 8), and other immune response networks (lysozyme, complement component 4 binding protein alpha, oligoadenylate synthetase 2, signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-9, α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, Ig lambda chain c region, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4, carboxylesterase 1), were suppressed by DON and ZEN.
In summary, our results indicate that high concentrations of DON and ZEN suppress the inflammatory response in kidneys, leading to potential effects on immune homeostasis.
Cytosolic DNA fragments are recognized as pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns that induce a cascade of innate immune responses. Moreover, excessive cytosolic DNA can enhance chronic inflammation, predominantly by activating inflammasomes, and thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic diseases, such as psoriasis. Psoriasis associated non-protein coding RNA induced by stress (PRINS) is a long non-coding RNA, which has been shown to be associated with psoriasis susceptibility and cellular stress responses; however, the precise mechanism of its action has not been determined. Here, we provide evidence that, in addition to inflammasome activation, cytosolic DNA induces intracellular inflammatory reactions while decreasing PRINS gene expression. Furthermore, PRINS overexpression can ameliorate the inflammatory-mediator production of keratinocytes induced by cytosolic DNA. Overexpression of PRINS resulted in decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL-5) expression and secretion. In silico analysis predicted direct binding sites between PRINS and the mRNAs, which was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay and on cellular level. Our results indicated that PRINS binds directly to the mRNAs of IL-6 and CCL-5 at specific binding sites and eventually destabilizes these mRNAs, leading to a decrease in their expression and secretion of the corresponding proteins. These results may indicate a restrictive role for PRINS in inflammatory processes.
Tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) is a transcriptional corepressor of Kruppel-associated box zinc finger protein, which has been reported to participate in carcinogenesis. Nonetheless, whether TRIM28 plays a role in the metastasis of ovarian carcinoma (OC) is unclear and requires further investigation. In this study, two OC cell lines (A2780 and OVCAR-3) with stable low expression of TRIM28 were established via RNA interference. We found that the migratory and invasive ability of TRIM28-silenced OC cells significantly decreased. The expression and activity of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in these OC cells were inhibited. The TRIM28 shRNA also suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OC cells as evidenced by the up-regulated E-cadherin and the downregulated Vimentin and N-cadherin. Additionally, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed in TRIM28-silenced OC cells: the activity of β-catenin was inhibited, the expression of total and nuclear β-catenin, Axin 2, T-cell factor 1 (TCF1) and lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) were decreased, whereas the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37 was enhanced. Further, re-expression of active β-catenin in TRIM28-silenced OC cells partly restored their metastasis in vitro. Taken together, our study demonstrates a contributory role of TRIM28 in OC metastasis in vitro, suggesting TRIM28 as a novel therapeutic target for this malignant tumor.
Inhibition of the bromodomain of the transcriptional regulator CBP/P300 is an especially interesting new therapeutic approach in oncology. We recently disclosed in vivo chemical tool 1 (GNE-272) for the bromodomain of CBP that was moderately potent and selective over BRD4(1). In pursuit of a more potent and selective CBP inhibitor, we used structure-based design. Constraining the aniline of 1 into a tetrahydroquinoline motif maintained potency and increased selectivity 2-fold. Structure-activity relationship studies coupled with further structure-based design targeting the LPF shelf, BC loop, and KAc regions allowed us to significantly increase potency and selectivity, resulting in the identification of non-CNS penetrant 19 (GNE-781, TR-FRET IC50 = 0.94 nM, BRET IC50 = 6.2 nM; BRD4(1) IC50 = 5100 nΜ) that maintained good in vivo PK properties in multiple species. Compound 19 displays antitumor activity in an AML tumor model and was also shown to decrease Foxp3 transcript levels in a dose dependent manner.
Influenza A virus (IAV) is an enveloped virus with a segmented single-stranded negative-strand RNA genome. In general, the role of virally encapsidated host cell proteins in the viral life cycle is unclear. The virion contains abundant ubiquitin molecules some of which have been identified as unanchored polyubiquitin chains. These ubiquitin chains have been postulated to play a role in recruiting histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) to the cytosolic surface of late endosomes (LEs), promoting IAV uncoating via aggresome processing-a cellular machinery that disposes of protein waste. HDAC6, a class II HDAC, is unusual because it resides mostly in the cytosol instead of the nucleus. It is a unique protein consisting of two catalytic domains (CDs) and a zinc-finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP) close to its C-terminus. This ZnF-UBP recognizes the unconjugated ubiquitin C-terminus (di-Gly motif) with very high affinity. Biochemical analyses showed that free di-Gly motifs are present in the form of unanchored ubiquitin inside IAV virions. These motifs are exposed following low pH-triggered viral fusion at the LEs and attract HDAC6 transiently to the cytosolic surface of vesicles. The binding of the two components promotes viral uncoating via HDAC6 interaction with cellular motor proteins dynein and myosin II and the viral M1 capsid. The cellular mechanism involved is related to aggresome processing, a pathway that promotes degradation of misfolded protein aggregates. K63-linked ubiquitin chains are thought to be the trigger for aggresome processing, though it is still not clear whether such types of chains are prevalent within the IAV capsid. Here, we present methods using purified ZnF-UBP domain of HDAC6 to immunoprecipitate viral unanchored ubiquitin chains, which can then be used for further biochemical analyses of ubiquitin chain linkage.
Titin (TTN) has multifunctional roles in sarcomere assembly, mechanosignaling transduction, and muscle stiffness. TTN splicing generates variable protein sizes with different functions. Therefore, understanding TTN splicing is important to develop a novel treatment for TTN-based diseases. The I-band TTN splicing regulated by RNA binding motif 20 (RBM20) has been extensively studied. However, the Z- and M-band splicing and regulation remain poorly understood. Herein, we aimed to define the Z- and M-band splicing in striated muscles and determined whether RBM20 regulates the Z- and M-band splicing. We discovered four new Z-band TTN splicing variants, and one of them dominates in mouse, rat, sheep, and human hearts. But only one form can be detected in frog and chicken hearts. In skeletal muscles, three new Z repeats (Zr) were detected, and Zr4 to 6 exclusion dominates in the fast muscles, whereas Zr4 skipping dominates in the slow muscle. No developmental changes were detected in the Z-band. In the M-band, two new variants were discovered with alternative 3' splice site in exon363 (Mex5) and alternative 5' splice site in intron 362. However, only the sheep heart expresses two new variants rather than other species. Skeletal muscles express three M-band variants with altered ratios of Mex5 inclusion to Mex5 exclusion. Finally, we revealed that RBM20 does not regulate the Z- and M-band splicing in the heart, but does in skeletal muscles. Taken together, we characterized the Z- and M-band splicing and provided the first evidence of the role of RBM20 in the Z- and M-band TTN splicing.
Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) transcription factor has recently been shown to control breast cancer progression. However, mechanistic aspects by which NRF1 may contribute to susceptibility to different breast tumor subtypes are still not fully understood. Since transcriptional control of NRF1 seems to be dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, herein, we investigated the role of NRF1 in estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor negative, but human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve) breast cancer. We found that both mRNA and protein levels of NRF1 and its transcriptional activity were significantly higher in ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve breast cancer samples compared to normal breast tissues. This was consistent with our observation of higher NRF1 protein expression in the experimental model of HER2+ breast cancer brain metastasis. To identify network-based pathways involved in the susceptibility to the ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve breast cancer subtype, the NRF1 transcriptional regulatory genome-wide landscape was analyzed using the approach consisting of a systematic integration of ChIP DNA-seq, RNA-Microarray, NRF1 protein-DNA motif binding, signal pathway analysis, and Bayesian machine learning. Our findings show that a high percentage of known HER2+ breast cancer susceptibility genes, including EGFR, IGFR, and E2F1, are under transcriptional control of NRF1. Promoters of several genes from the KEGG HER2+ breast cancer pathway and 11 signaling pathways linked to 6 hallmarks of cancer contain the NRF1 motif. By pathway analysis, key breast cancer hallmark genes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness, cell apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, chromosomal integrity, and DNA damage/repair were highly enriched with NRF1 motifs. In addition, we found using Bayesian network-based machine learning that 30 NRF1 motif-enriched genes including growth factor receptors-FGFR1, IGF1R; E2Fs transcription factor family-E2F1, E2F3; MAPK pathway-SHC2, GRB2, MAPK1; PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway-PIK3CD, PIK3R1, PIK3R3, RPS6KB2; WNT signaling pathway-WNT7B, DLV1, DLV2, GSK3B, NRF1, and DDB2, known for its role in DNA repair and involvement in early events associated with metastatic progression of breast cancer cells, were associated with HER2-amplified breast cancer. Machine learning search further revealed that the likelihood of HER2-positive breast cancer is almost 100% in a patient with the high NRF1 expression combined with expression patterns of high E2F3, GSK3B, and MAPK1, low or no change in E2F1 and FGFR1, and high or no change in PIK3R3. In summary, our findings suggest novel roles of NRF1 and its regulatory networks in susceptibility to the ER/PR -ve HER2 +ve aggressive breast cancer subtype. Clinical confirmation of our machine learned Bayesian networks will have significant impact on our understanding of the role of NRF1 as a valuable biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis as well as provide strong rationale for future studies to develop NRF1 signaling-based therapeutics to target HER2+ breast cancer.
The RNA-binding protein Musashi 2 (MSI2) has emerged as an important regulator in cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Translocations and deregulation of the MSI2 gene are diagnostic of certain cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with translocation t(7;17), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation t(10;17), and some cases of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pB-ALL). To better understand the function of MSI2 in leukemia, the mRNA targets that are bound and regulated by MSI2 and their MSI2-binding motifs need to be identified. To this end, using photoactivatable ribonucleoside cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and the multiple EM for motif elicitation (MEME) analysis tool, here we identified MSI2's mRNA targets and the consensus RNA-recognition element (RRE) motif recognized by MSI2 (UUAG). Of note, MSI2 knockdown altered the expression of several genes with roles in eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathways. We also show that MSI2 regulates classic interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling by promoting the degradation of the mRNA of IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST or GP130), which, in turn, affected the phosphorylation statuses of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK. In summary, we have identified multiple MSI2-regulated mRNAs and provided evidence that MSI2 controls IL6ST activity that control oncogenic signaling networks. Our findings may help inform strategies for unraveling the role of MSI2 in leukemia to pave the way for the development of targeted therapies.
RNA‑binding motif 3 (RBM3) is a cold‑shock protein that has been previously shown to attenuate cancer stem cell‑like features in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. However, the mechanism underlying RBM3 regulation in PCa cells is largely unknown. The present study investigated the impact of RBM3 expression on the whole transcriptome of PCa cells using high‑throughput RNA sequencing (RNA‑seq). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified through RNA‑seq were applied to Gene Ontology (GO), pathway analysis, pathway‑action networks and protein‑protein interaction network analysis. GO and pathway ananlyses showed that RBM3 expression was associated with several metabolism pathways. Combining GO analysis and pathway analysis, certain DEGs, including phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A), PLA2G2F, PLA2G4C, endothelin 1, cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily B member 6, G protein subunit γ5, nitric oxide synthase 3 and CD38 molecule, were shown to be closely associated with RBM3 regulation in PCa cells. Furthermore, the changes in expression of selected genes upon RBM3‑knockdown in RNA‑seq were confirmed by separate reverse transcription‑quantitative‑polymerase chain reaction, validating the results of RNA‑seq. Thus, the present study provides a series of valuable reference genes and pathways for the future study of the pathogenic role of RBM3 in the development of PCa.
Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is an important antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and mediates inhibition of translation initiation and protein synthesis in various types of viral infection. In this study, the complete coding sequence (CDS) of goose PKR (goPKR) is identified and characterized. The open reading frame (ORF) of goPKR is 1668 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 555 amino acids. The sequence identity results demonstrate that the goose PKR is most closely related to duck PKR gene, with nucleotide identities of 91.6%, whereas nucleotide identity of the goose PKR to chicken, human, and mouse PKR is 76.4%, 51.9%, and 52.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of goose PKR contains 3 main structure domains, including 2 double-strand RNA-binding motif (dsRBM) domains and one serine/threonine protein kinase domain. This is similar to the chicken and mammals, whereas it is different from duck PKR protein, which contains only one dsRBM1 domain and one serine/threonine protein kinase domain. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicates that goose PKR mRNA is widely expressed in all sampled tissues. It is highly expressed in the blood, spleen, lung, and bursa of Fabricius and jejunum and is slightly expressed in heart, muscle, trachea, and brain. The results of confocal microscopy suggest that PKR-EGFP is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and overexpression of goPKR protein significantly reduces Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication (viral copies and viral titer) in goose embryo fibroblasts. These findings show that goose PKR is an important antiviral ISG, involved in the antiviral innate immune defense to NDV in geese.
RNA-binding proteins chaperone the biological functions of noncoding RNA by reducing RNA misfolding, improving matchmaking between regulatory RNA and targets, and exerting quality control over RNP biogenesis. Recent studies of Escherichia coli CspA, HIV NCp, and E. coli Hfq are beginning to show how RNA-binding proteins remodel RNA structures. These different protein families use common strategies for disrupting or annealing RNA double helices, which can be used to understand the mechanisms by which proteins chaperone RNA-dependent regulation in bacteria.
RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3), a stress-inducible RNA-binding protein that increases protein synthesis and confers cell protection in multiple cell types, has been identified as a possible regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of elevated RBM3 on skeletal muscle hypertrophy and resistance to atrophy. Plasmid-mediated overexpression of RBM3 in vitro and in vivo was used to assess the role of RBM3 in muscle. C2C12 myotubes overexpressing RBM3 were approximately 1.6 times larger than non-transfected myotubes, suggesting a role for RBM3 in hypertrophy. In addition, elevated RBM3 attenuated atrophy in myotubes exposed to dexamethasone. In agreement with in vitro results, overexpression of RBM3 in soleus muscle of F344/BN rats using electroporation techniques increased the cross sectional area of muscle fibers. Overexpression of RBM3 also attenuated muscle atrophy in rat soleus muscle undergoing disuse atrophy. These findings provide direct evidence for a novel role of RBM3 in inducing hypertrophy as well as attenuating atrophy.
Acinus is an abundant nuclear protein involved in apoptosis and splicing. It has been implicated in inducing apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation during programmed cell death. Acinus undergoes activation by proteolytic cleavage that produces a truncated p17 form that comprises only the RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. We have determined the crystal structure of the human Acinus RRM domain (AcRRM) at 1.65 Å resolution. It shows a classical four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet fold with two flanking α-helices and an additional, non-classical α-helix at the C-terminus, which harbors the caspase-3 target sequence that is cleaved during Acinus activation. In the structure, the C-terminal α-helix partially occludes the potential ligand binding surface of the β-sheet and hypothetically shields it from non-sequence specific interactions with RNA. Based on the comparison with other RRM-RNA complex structures, it is likely that the C-terminal α-helix changes its conformation with respect to the RRM core in order to enable RNA binding by Acinus.
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant post-transcriptional RNA modification that influences multiple aspects of gene expression. In addition to recruiting proteins, m6A can modulate RNA function by destabilizing base pairing. Here, we show that when neighbored by a 5' bulge, m6A stabilizes m6A-U base pairs, and global RNA structure by ~1 kcal mol-1. The bulge most likely provides the flexibility needed to allow optimal stacking between the methyl group and 3' neighbor through a conformation that is stabilized by Mg2+. A bias toward this motif can help explain the global impact of methylation on RNA structure in transcriptome-wide studies. While m6A embedded in duplex RNA is poorly recognized by the YTH domain reader protein and m6A antibodies, both readily recognize m6A in this newly identified motif. The results uncover potentially abundant and functional m6A motifs that can modulate the epitranscriptomic structure landscape with important implications for the interpretation of transcriptome-wide data.
Rotaviruses (RVs) cause life-threatening diarrhea in infants and children worldwide. Recent biochemical and epidemiological studies underscore the importance of histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) as both cell attachment and susceptibility factors for the globally dominant P[4], P[6], and P[8] genotypes of human RVs. How these genotypes interact with HBGA is not known. Here, our crystal structures of P[4] and a neonate-specific P[6] VP8*s alone and in complex with H-type I HBGA reveal a unique glycan binding site that is conserved in the globally dominant genotypes and allows for the binding of ABH HBGAs, consistent with their prevalence. Remarkably, the VP8* of P[6] RVs isolated from neonates displays subtle structural changes in this binding site that may restrict its ability to bind branched glycans. This provides a structural basis for the age-restricted tropism of some P[6] RVs as developmentally regulated unbranched glycans are more abundant in the neonatal gut.
It is well established that lung pathology and inflammation are more severe during respiratory infections complicated by the presence of both bacteria and viruses. Whilst co-infection can result in invasive pneumococcal disease and systemic inflammation, the neuroinflammatory consequences of co-infection are poorly characterised.
In this study, we utilised a mouse co-infection model involving Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and influenza A virus (IAV) lung infection, and we also isolated microglia for ex vivo stimulation with pneumococcus or serum amyloid A (SAA).
Co-infection but not S. pneumoniae or IAV alone significantly increased the number of amoeboid-shaped microglia and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL-2) in the hypothalamus. Pneumococcus was only detected in the hypothalamus of co-infected mice. In addition, the systemic inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 were not elevated in co-infected mice relative to IAV-infected mice, whereas SAA levels were markedly increased in co-infected mice (p &lt; 0.05). SAA and its functional receptor termed formyl peptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) transcript expression were also increased in the hypothalamus. In mouse primary microglia, recombinant SAA but not S. pneumoniae stimulated TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and CCL-2 expression, and this response was completely blocked by the pro-resolving Fpr2 agonist aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1).
In summary, lung co-infection increased the number of 'activated' amoeboid-shaped microglia and inflammatory cytokine expression in the hypothalamus. Whilst persistent pneumococcal brain infection was observed, SAA proved to be a much more potent stimulus of microglia than pneumococci, and this response was potently suppressed by the anti-inflammatory AT-RvD1. Targeting Fpr2 with pro-resolving eicosanoids such as AT-RvD1 may restore microglial homeostasis during severe respiratory infections.
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in RNAs play important roles in regulating many different aspects of gene expression. While m6As can have direct effects on the structure, maturation, or translation of mRNAs, such modifications can also influence the fate of RNAs via proteins termed "readers" that specifically recognize and bind modified nucleotides. Several YTH domain-containing proteins have been identified as m6A readers that regulate the splicing, translation, or stability of specific mRNAs. In contrast to the other YTH domain-containing proteins, YTHDC2 has several defined domains and here, we have analyzed the contribution of these domains to the RNA and protein interactions of YTHDC2. The YTH domain of YTHDC2 preferentially binds m6A-containing RNAs via a conserved hydrophobic pocket, whereas the ankyrin repeats mediate an RNA-independent interaction with the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRN1. We show that the YTH and R3H domains contribute to the binding of YTHDC2 to cellular RNAs, and using crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC), we reveal that YTHDC2 interacts with the small ribosomal subunit in close proximity to the mRNA entry/exit sites. YTHDC2 was recently found to promote a "fast-track" expression program for specific mRNAs, and our data suggest that YTHDC2 accomplishes this by recruitment of the RNA degradation machinery to regulate the stability of m6A-containing mRNAs and by utilizing its distinct RNA-binding domains to bridge interactions between m6A-containing mRNAs and the ribosomes to facilitate their efficient translation.
Dysregulation of mRNA splicing has been observed in certain cellular senescence process. However, the common splicing alterations on the whole transcriptome shared by various types of senescence are poorly understood. In order to systematically identify senescence-associated transcriptomic changes in genome-wide scale, we collected RNA sequencing datasets of different human cell types with a variety of senescence-inducing methods from public databases and performed meta-analysis. First, we discovered that a group of RNA binding proteins were consistently down-regulated in diverse senescent samples and identified 406 senescence-associated common differential splicing events. Then, eight differentially expressed RNA binding proteins were predicted to regulate these senescence-associated splicing alterations through an enrichment analysis of their RNA binding information, including motif scanning and enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation data. In addition, we constructed the splicing regulatory modules that might contribute to senescence-associated biological processes. Finally, it was confirmed that knockdown of the predicted senescence-associated potential splicing regulators through shRNAs in HepG2 cell line could result in senescence-like splicing changes. Taken together, our work demonstrated a broad range of common changes in mRNA splicing switches and detected their central regulatory RNA binding proteins during senescence. These findings would help to better understand the coordinating splicing alterations in cellular senescence.
A class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has architectural functions in nuclear body construction; however, specific RNA domains dictating their architectural functions remain uninvestigated. Here, we identified the domains of the architectural NEAT1 lncRNA that construct paraspeckles. Systematic deletion of NEAT1 portions using CRISPR/Cas9 in haploid cells revealed modular domains of NEAT1 important for RNA stability, isoform switching, and paraspeckle assembly. The middle domain, containing functionally redundant subdomains, was responsible for paraspeckle assembly. Artificial tethering of the NONO protein to a NEAT1_2 mutant lacking the functional subdomains rescued paraspeckle assembly, and this required the NOPS dimerization domain of NONO. Paraspeckles exhibit phase-separated properties including susceptibility to 1,6-hexanediol treatment. RNA fragments of the NEAT1_2 subdomains preferentially bound NONO/SFPQ, leading to phase-separated aggregates in vitro. Thus, we demonstrate that the enrichment of NONO dimers on the redundant NEAT1_2 subdomains initiates construction of phase-separated paraspeckles, providing mechanistic insights into lncRNA-based nuclear body formation.
YTH domain-containing RNA-binding proteins are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and play important roles in the growth and development as well as abiotic stress responses of plants. However, YTH genes have not been previously studied in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). In this study, a total of five YTH genes (CsYTH1-CsYTH5) were identified in cucumber, which could be mapped on three out of the seven cucumber chromosomes. All CsYTH proteins had highly conserved C-terminal YTH domains, and two of them (CsYTH1 and CsYTH4) harbored extra CCCH and P/Q/N-rich domains. The phylogenesis, conserved motifs and exon-intron structure of YTH genes from cucumber, Arabidopsis and rice were also analyzed. The phylogenetically closely clustered YTHs shared similar gene structures and conserved motifs. An analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements in the upstream region of these genes resulted in the identification of many cis-elements related to stress, hormone and development. Expression analysis based on the transcriptome data showed that some CsYTHs had development- or tissue-specific expression. In addition, their expression levels were altered under various stresses such as salt, drought, cold, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. These findings lay the foundation for the functional analysis of CsYTHs in the future.
The first RNA recognition motif of the Drosophila SNF protein is an example of an RNA binding protein with multi-specificity. It binds different RNA hairpin loops in spliceosomal U1 or U2 small nuclear RNAs, and only in the latter case requires the auxiliary U2A' protein. Here we investigate its functions by crystal structures of SNF alone and bound to U1 stem-loop II, U2A' or U2 stem-loop IV and U2A', SNF dynamics from NMR spectroscopy, and structure-guided mutagenesis in binding studies. We find that different loop-closing base pairs and a nucleotide exchange at the tips of the loops contribute to differential SNF affinity for the RNAs. U2A' immobilizes SNF and RNA residues to restore U2 stem-loop IV binding affinity, while U1 stem-loop II binding does not require such adjustments. Our findings show how U2A' can modulate RNA specificity of SNF without changing SNF conformation or relying on direct RNA contacts.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are conserved and related with protein-serine/threonine kinases that participate in the regulation of multiple biological processes, such as cell survival, cell differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation. However, little is known about the roles of this kinase in the pearl oyster. In this study, we cloned and identified an ERK homolog from Pinctada fucata (PfErk). Furthermore, we have unraveled its expressional kinetics after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-epolycytidylic acid (poly I:C) immune challenge. Pferk harbored a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 12 bp, a coding sequence of 1074 bp, and a 3' UTR of 882 bp. The putative peptide comprised a predicted molecular mass of 41.19 kDa, with a theoretical pI of 6.15. Sequence analysis showed that it possesses one STK catalytic domain and a conserved His-Arg-Asp (HRD) domain. In addition, a canonical Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) dual phosphorylation motif and an ATRW substrate binding site were also identified in the coding protein. Homology assessment of PfErk showed high similarity to Homo sapiens ERK. Phylogenetic analysis supported a close evolutionary relationship with molluscan orthologs. The expression patterns of Pferk were observed in seven different tissues of pearl oyster, with highest expression in the mantle and lowest expression in the digestive gland. Pferk mRNA expression levels were detected at developmental stages, with the highest expression in D-shaped larvae, followed by the 32-cell stage. The mRNA expression of Pferk was upregulated significantly in P. fucata mantle primary cells and mantle tissue after LPS and poly (I:C) treatment, and PfErk phosphorylation levels were activated by LPS and poly (I:C) challenges. Overall, our results suggested that PfErk may play important roles in pearl oyster innate immunity, and provided a new understanding of mantle immunity in the pearl oyster.
The term systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) describes an autoinflammatory condition characterized by arthritis and severe systemic inflammation, which in later stages can transform into interleukin (IL)-17-driven autoimmune arthritis. IL-1 antagonists have been used with good efficacy in the early stages of sJIA.
A whole transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood RNA samples was performed in six patients with sJIA and active systemic disease, before initiating treatment with the IL-1β receptor antagonist anakinra, and after induction of inactive disease, compared with a single-sample control cohort of 21 patients in several clinical stages of sJIA activity. Whole transcriptomes were compared longitudinally and interindividually including gene ontology and motif enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes.
There were 741 transcripts were identified using a threshold with a p value &lt;0.01 and a fold change &gt; 2. HLADRB1 and CD74 were identified as the most strongly upregulated genes in inactive compared to active disease; CD177 expression was significantly enhanced in active disease compared to inactive disease. Motif enrichment analysis revealed STAT4, BCL6, and STAT3 as the most prominent transcription factors that were present during active disease. In addition, strong upregulation of the major histocompatability complex II (MHCII) ligand CD74 was found in both active and inactive sJIA compared to healthy controls.
Using transcription factor motif enrichment, this study identifies novel putative pathways in sJIA (STAT4, BCL6) implicating B cell activation at an earlier stage than predicted in refractory disease. The implication of BCL-6 dependent pathways argues for occurrence of autoimmunity early within the process of sJIA chronification. Transcriptional regulation of HLA-DRB1, a recently described independent genetic risk factor, in combination with its cooperating partner CD74 in patients where sJIA is confirmed, supports pathogenic involvement in alterations in antigen presentation during sJIA.
Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase which has been implicated in the regulation of a number of viruses, including HIV-1, Ebolavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus. Catalytic subunits of PP1 (PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ) interact with a host of regulatory subunits and target a wide variety of cellular substrates through a combination of short binding motifs, including an RVxF motif present in the majority of PP1 regulatory subunits. Targeting the RVxF-interacting site on PP1 with the small molecule 1E7-03 inhibits HIV-1, Ebolavirus, and Rift Valley fever virus replication. In this study, we determined the effect of PP1 on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication. Treatment of VEEV-infected cells with 1E7-03 decreased viral replication by more than 2 logs (50% effective concentration [EC50] = 0.6 μM). 1E7-03 treatment reduced viral titers starting at 8 h postinfection. Viral replication was also decreased after treatment with PP1α-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that PP1α shuttles toward the cytosol during infection with VEEV and that PP1α colocalizes with VEEV capsid. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed VEEV capsid interaction with PP1α. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry data showed that VEEV capsid is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation is moderated by PP1α. Finally, less viral RNA is associated with capsid after treatment with 1E7-03. Coupled with data showing that 1E7-03 inhibits several alphaviruses, this study indicates that inhibition of the PP1α RVxF binding pocket is a promising therapeutic target and provides novel evidence that PP1α modulation of VEEV capsid phosphorylation influences viral replication.IMPORTANCE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes moderate flu-like symptoms and can lead to severe encephalitic disease and potentially death. There are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines for human use, and understanding the molecular underpinning of host-virus interactions can aid in the rational design of intervention strategies. The significance of our research is in identifying the interaction between protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and the viral capsid protein. This interaction is important for viral replication, as inhibition of PP1 results in decrease viral replication. Inhibition of PP1 also inhibited multiple biomedically important alphaviruses, indicating that PP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for alphavirus-induced disease.
MCPIP1, also known as Regnase-1, is a ribonuclease crucial for regulation of stability of transcripts related to inflammatory processes. Here, we report that MCPIP1 acts as an endonuclease by degrading several stem-loop RNA structures and single-stranded RNAs. Our studies revealed cleavage sites present in the stem-loops derived from the 3' untranslated region of the interleukin-6 transcript. Furthermore, MCPIP1 induced endonuclease cleavage at the loop motif of stem-loop structures. Additionally, we observed that MCPIP1 could cleave single-stranded RNA fragments. However, RNA substrates shorter than 6 nucleotides were not further affected by MCPIP1 nucleolytic activity. In this study, we also determined the dissociation constants of full-length MCPIP1D141N and its ribonuclease domain PIN D141N with twelve oligonucleotides substrates. The equilibrium binding constants (Kd) for MCPIP1D141N and the RNA targets were approximately 10 nM. Interestingly, we observed that the presence of a zinc finger in the PIN domain increases the affinity of this protein fragment to 25-nucleotide-long stem-loop RNA but not to shorter ones. Furthermore, size exclusion chromatography of the MCPIP1 and PIN proteins suggested that MCPIP1 undergoes homooligomerization during interaction with RNA substrates. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of MCPIP1 substrate recognition and its affinity towards various oligonucleotides.
This protocol is an extension to: Nat. Protoc. 10, 1643-1669 (2015); doi:10.1038/nprot.2015.103; published online 01 October 2015RNAs play key roles in many cellular processes. The underlying structure of RNA is an important determinant of how transcripts function, are processed, and interact with RNA-binding proteins and ligands. RNA structure analysis by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) takes advantage of the reactivity of small electrophilic chemical probes that react with the 2'-hydroxyl group to assess RNA structure at nucleotide resolution. When coupled with mutational profiling (MaP), in which modified nucleotides are detected as internal miscodings during reverse transcription and then read out by massively parallel sequencing, SHAPE yields quantitative per-nucleotide measurements of RNA structure. Here, we provide an extension to our previous in vitro SHAPE-MaP protocol with detailed guidance for undertaking and analyzing SHAPE-MaP probing experiments in live cells. The MaP strategy works for both abundant-transcriptome experiments and for cellular RNAs of low to moderate abundance, which are not well examined by whole-transcriptome methods. In-cell SHAPE-MaP, performed in roughly 3 d, can be applied in cell types ranging from bacteria to cultured mammalian cells and is compatible with a variety of structure-probing reagents. We detail several strategies by which in-cell SHAPE-MaP can inform new biological hypotheses and emphasize downstream analyses that reveal sequence or structure motifs important for RNA interactions in cells.
Therapeutic hypothermia during cardiac surgery has been widely used for neuroprotection and to attenuate the systemic inflammatory response due to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Experimental data suggest that cold-shock protein RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3), which is induced in response to hypothermia, plays a key role in hypothermia-induced organ protection. To date, investigation on RBM3 has been performed exclusively in vitro or in animal models, and the detection and regulation of RBM3 in human blood has not been investigated until now. The objective was to investigate the level of RBM3 protein and cytokine expression profile involved in the inflammatory response in patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery involving CPB and therapeutic hypothermia. A single-center prospective trial with 23 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB was performed. RBM3 protein was quantified in blood serum samples collected from patients and healthy individuals by employing a new developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine levels were analyzed from dry blood spot samples by using a Quanterix Simoa Immunoassay. For the first time, RBM3 protein was detected in blood samples of patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery. Hereby, RBM3 protein concentrations were significantly elevated in patients after cardiac surgery with CPB and mild hypothermia as compared with pre-surgery levels. Moreover, a complex immune reaction with significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, IL-18, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, CC-chemokine ligand [CCL]3, CCL4, intercellular adhesion molecule-1) in response to CPB was detected. Significantly elevated vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metallopeptidase 3 concentrations reflecting ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury were observed 24 hours after weaning from CPB. The use of CPB is still associated with a complex inflammatory response. RBM3 protein is measurable in blood samples of patients with significantly higher concentrations after cardiac surgery with CPB and mild-to-moderate hypothermia. RBM3 is a new candidate as a biomarker for therapeutic hypothermia and a possible new therapeutic target for organ protection.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common, progressive, and polygenic cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. The molecular pathogenesis of the primary events of AMD is poorly understood. We have investigated a transcriptome-wide analysis of differential gene expression, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), indels, and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in datasets of the human peripheral retina and RPE-choroid-sclera control and AMD.
Adaptors and unbiased components were removed and checked to ensure the quality of the data sets. Molecular function, biological process, cellular component, and pathway analyses were performed on differentially expressed genes. Analysis of the gene expression datasets identified 5011 upregulated genes, 11,800 downregulated genes, 42,016 SNPs, 1141 indels, and 6668 SRRs between healthy controls and AMD donor material. Enrichment categories for gene ontology included chemokine activity, cytokine activity, cytokine receptor binding, immune system process, and signal transduction respectively. A functional pathways analysis identified that chemokine receptors bind chemokines, complement cascade genes, and create cytokine signaling in immune system pathway genes (p value &lt; 0.001). Finally, allele-specific expression was found to be significant for Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 2, 3, 4, 13, 19, 21; C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 1, 5; chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 9, 10, 16; C-X-C chemokine receptor type (CXCR) 6; as well as atypical chemokine receptor (ACKR) 3,4 and pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP).
Our results improve our overall understanding of the chemokine receptors' signaling pathway in AMD conditions, which may lead to potential new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
Immune-modulatory effects of β-glucans are generally considered beneficial to fish health. Despite the frequent application of β-glucans in aquaculture practice, the exact receptors and downstream signalling remains to be described for fish. In mammals, Dectin-1 is a member of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family and the best-described receptor for β-glucans. In fish genomes, no clear homologue of Dectin-1 could be identified so far. Yet, in previous studies we could activate carp macrophages with curdlan, considered a Dectin-1-specific β-(1,3)-glucan ligand in mammals. It was therefore proposed that immune-modulatory effects of β-glucan in carp macrophages could be triggered by a member of the CLR family activating the classical CLR signalling pathway, different from Dectin-1. In the current study, we used primary macrophages of common carp to examine immune modulation by β-glucans using transcriptome analysis of RNA isolated 6 h after stimulation with two different β-glucan preparations. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that both β-glucans regulate a comparable signalling pathway typical of CLR activation. Carp genome analysis identified 239 genes encoding for proteins with at least one C-type Lectin Domains (CTLD). Narrowing the search for candidate β-glucan receptors, based on the presence of a conserved glucan-binding motif, identified 13 genes encoding a WxH sugar-binding motif in their CTLD. These genes, however, were not expressed in macrophages. Instead, among the β-glucan-stimulated DEGs, a total of six CTLD-encoding genes were significantly regulated, all of which were down-regulated in carp macrophages. Several candidates had a protein architecture similar to Dectin-1, therefore potential conservation of synteny of the mammalian Dectin-1 region was investigated by mining the zebrafish genome. Partial conservation of synteny with a region on the zebrafish chromosome 16 highlighted two genes as candidate β-glucan receptor. Altogether, the regulation of a gene expression profile typical of a signalling pathway associated with CLR activation and, the identification of several candidate β-glucan receptors, suggest that immune-modulatory effects of β-glucan in carp macrophages could be a result of signalling mediated by a member of the CLR family.
The myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins belong to interferon-induced dynamin GTPase and play pivotal role in the inhibition of replication of numerous viruses. These antiviral proteins are released in usual or diseased condition to prevent the viral attack and to carry regular cellular activities like endocytosis and trafficking of nucleoproteins into the nucleus. The invasion of virus up-regulates the expression of Mx transcripts and double-stranded RNA mimic like polyinosinic polycytidyilic acid (Poly I:C). To understand the tissue-specific expression profiling and mechanism of GTP recognition of Mx protein from Labeo rohita (rohu), the full-length gene was cloned, sequenced and characterized through various Bioinformatics tools for the first time. The Mx cDNA was comprised of 2297 bp, and the open reading frame of 1938 bp encodes polypeptide of 631 amino acids. The coding sequence of Mx protein possess the signature motif of dynamin superfamily, LPRG(S/K)GIVTR, the tripartite guanosine-5/triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif (GXXXSGKS/T, DXXG and T/NKXD) and the leucine zipper motifs at the C-terminal end, well conserved in all interferon-induced Mx protein in vertebrates. Western blotting confirmed the molecular weight of Mx protein to be 72 kDa. After the intraperitoneal challenge of L. rohita with a Poly I:C, up-regulation of Mx protein was observed in brain, spleen, liver, kidney, intestine, heart, muscle, and gill. Ontogeny study displayed pronounced expression of Mx protein in all stages of the developmental of Rohu after Poly I:C induction. However a persistent expression of Mx transcript was also observed in Rohu egg as well as milt without induction with Poly I:C. Higher expression of Mx gene was observed on 96 h where it was 6.4 folds higher than the control. The computational modelling of Mx protein portrayed the tripartite N-terminal G-domain that binds to GTP, the bundle-signaling element (BSE) which interconnects the G-domain to the elongated stalk domain and C-terminal helical stalk domain. In agreement with the experimental studies, a series of conserved residues viz., Gln52, Ser53, Ser54, Leu68, Pro69, Gly71, Gly73, Thr76, Asp151, Gly154, Thr220, Lys221, Val251, Cys253, Arg254, and Gly255 were computed to be indispensable for tight anchoring of GTP within binding cavity of G-domain. The binding free energy calculation study depicted that the van der Waals and electrostatic terms contributs significantly to molecular recognition of GTP. Collectively, our study provides mechanistic insights into the tissue-specific expression profiling and GTP binding mechanism of Mx protein from Labeo rohita, which is expected to drive further research on several cellular events including viral resistance and endocytosis in the near future.
Delayed re-endothelialization after balloon angioplasty in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease impairs vascular healing and leads to neointimal proliferation. In the present study, we examined the effect of RNA-binding motif protein 38 (Rbm38) during re-endothelialization in a murine model of experimental vascular injury.
Left common carotid arteries of C57BL/6 mice were electrically denudated and endothelial regeneration was evaluated. Profiling of RNA-binding proteins revealed dysregulated expression of Rbm38 in the denudated and regenerated areas. We next tested the importance of Rbm38 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and analyzed its effects on cellular proliferation, migration und apoptosis. Rbm38 silencing in vitro demonstrated important beneficial functional effects on migratory capacity and proliferation of endothelial cells. In vivo, local silencing of Rbm38 also improved re-endothelialization of denuded carotid arteries. Luciferase reporter assay identified miR-98 and let-7f to regulate Rbm38 and the positive proliferative properties of Rbm38 silencing in vitro and in vivo were mimicked by therapeutic overexpression of these miRNAs.
The present data identified Rbm38 as an important factor of the regulation of various endothelial cell functions. Local inhibition of Rbm38 as well as overexpression of the upstream regulators miR-98 and let-7f improved endothelial regeneration in vivo and thus may be a novel therapeutic entry point to avoid endothelial damage after balloon angioplasty.
Human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) contribute to bronchial contraction and airway hyperresponsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma. They also generate cytokines, chemokines, and matricellular proteins. Ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1) senses extracellular protons and mediates the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in ASMCs.
ASMCs were stimulated for the indicated time by pH 6.3 or pH 7.4-adjusted Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (0.1% BSA-DMEM). As a control stimulant, pH 7.4-adjusted 0.1% BSA-DMEM containing 10 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was used. Interleukin-8/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) mRNA expression in ASMCs was quantified by RT-PCR using real-time TaqMan technology. CXCL8 secreted from ASMCs was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Phosphorylation at serine 536 of NF-κB p65 and binding of p65 to oligonucleotide containing an NF-κB consensus binding site were analyzed by Western blotting and an ELISA-based kit.
Acidic pH induced a significant increase of CXCL8 mRNA expression and CXCL8 protein secretion in ASMCs. ASMCs transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted for OGR1 produced less CXCL8 compared with those transfected with non-targeting siRNA. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, MEK1/2 inhibitor, and the inhibitor of IκB phosphorylation reduced acidic pH-stimulated CXCL8 production in ASMCs. Dexamethasone also inhibited acidic pH-stimulated CXCL8 production of ASMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Dexamethasone did not affect either phosphorylation or binding to the consensus DNA site of NF-κB p65.
CXCL8 released from ASMCs by extracellular acidification may play a pivotal role in airway accumulation of neutrophils. Glucocorticoids inhibit acidic pH-stimulated CXCL8 production independent of serine 536 phosphorylation and the binding to DNA of NF-κB p65, although NF-κB activity is essential for CXCL8 production in ASMCs.
At low temperatures, the liver increases glucose utilization and expresses RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3) to cope with cold exposure. In this study, the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), bone marrow differentiation factor 88 (MYD88), and phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was consistent with fluctuations in insulin in fasted cold-exposed mice. We also found up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) in acute cold exposure with a decrease in core body temperature. RBM3 transcription and translation were activated 2 h after cold exposure. The anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2/Bax ratio also increased, while expression of apoptosis factors: cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) was unchanged. Liver glycogen was depleted after 2 h of cold exposure, and blood glucose decreased after 4 h. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation continued to increase to promote hepatic glycogen synthesis. We found a high level of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation after 6 h of cold exposure. In addition, we demonstrated that after cold exposure for 2 h, in the liver, continued phosphorylation of fructose-2,6-diphosphate (PFKFB2) and decreased accumulation of glycogen intermediates fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) and pyruvic acid (PA). In summary, the liver responds to cold exposure through a number of different pathways, including activation of HSP70/TLR4 signaling pathways, up-regulation of RBM3 expression, and increased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. We propose a possible signaling pathway in which regulation of RBM3 expression by the liver affects the AKT metabolic signaling pathway. Lay summary In response to changes in ambient temperature, mice regulate global metabolism and gene expression through hormones. This study focused on the effects of environmental hypothermia on molecular pathways of glucose metabolism in the liver, which is the important metabolic organ in mice. This provides a basis for further study of mice against cold exposure damage.
The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are evolutionally conserved from yeasts to mammals, and are involved in the regulation of cells response to various extracellular stimuli. In this study, the p38 MAPK gene (designated as Spp38) of mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) was identified and studied. Spp38 contained the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif and a Ala-Thr-Arg-Trp (ATRW) substrate-binding site. Spp38 transcript was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression found in muscle and hepatopancras. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Spp38 was upregulated in hemocytes and hepatopancras after infection with Vibrio parahemolyticus and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Reporter gene assays indicated that Spp38 activated the expression of anti-lipopolysaccharides (SpALF1 - SpALF6) in S. paramamosian. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Spp38 or inhibition of Spp38 by SB203580 decreased the expression levels of SpALF1-6 and dual oxidase (SpDuox1 and SpDuox2) in S. paramamosian, which consequently reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production thereby significantly increasing the bacterial count in the hemolymph of mud crabs. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in bacterial clearance ability of hemolymph after Spp38 knockdown followed by V. parahemolyticus infection. Taken together, the current data indicated that Spp38 could play a vital role in maintaining the homeostasis of hemolymph microbiota in S. paramamosain.
Homoharringtonine (HHT), a known protein synthesis inhibitor, has an anti-myeloid leukemia effect and potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline/cytarabine induction regimens for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with favorable and intermediate prognoses, especially in the t(8;21) subtype. Here we provide evidence showing that HHT inhibits the activity of leukemia-initiating cells (Lin-/Sca-1-/c-kit+; LICs) in a t(8;21) murine leukemia model and exerts a down-regulating effect on MYC pathway genes in human t(8;21) leukemia cells (Kasumi-1). We discovered that NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) is bound directly by HHT via the second double-strand RNA-binding motif (DSRM2) domain, which is the nuclear localization signal of NKRF. A series of deletion and mutagenesis experiments mapped HHT direct binding sites to K479 and C480 amino acids in the DSRM2 domain. HHT treatment shifts NKRF from the nucleus (including nucleoli) to the cytoplasm by occupying the DSRM2 domain, strengthens the p65-NKRF interaction, and interferes with p65-p50 complex formation, thereby attenuating the transactivation activity of p65 on the MYC gene. Moreover, HHT significantly decreases the expression of KIT, a frequently mutated and/or highly expressed gene in t(8;21) AML, in concert with MYC down-regulation. Our work thus identifies a mechanism of action of HHT that is different from, but acts in concert with, the known mode of action of this compound. These results justify further clinical testing of HHT in AML.
Cell survival after oxidative DNA damage requires signaling, repair and transcriptional events often enabled by nucleosome displacement, exchange or removal by chromatin remodeling enzymes. Here, we show that Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 6 (CHD6), distinct to other CHD enzymes, is stabilized during oxidative stress via reduced degradation. CHD6 relocates rapidly to DNA damage in a manner dependent upon oxidative lesions and a conserved N-terminal poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent recruitment motif, with later retention requiring the double chromodomain and central core. CHD6 ablation increases reactive oxygen species persistence and impairs anti-oxidant transcriptional responses, leading to elevated DNA breakage and poly(ADP-ribose) induction that cannot be rescued by catalytic or double chromodomain mutants. Despite no overt epigenetic or DNA repair abnormalities, CHD6 loss leads to impaired cell survival after chronic oxidative stress, abnormal chromatin relaxation, amplified DNA damage signaling and checkpoint hypersensitivity. We suggest that CHD6 is a key regulator of the oxidative DNA damage response.
Encapsidation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is a crucial step in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Binding by viral polymerase (Pol) to the epsilon stem-loop (ε) on the 5'-terminal region (TR) of pgRNA is required for pgRNA packaging. However, the detailed mechanism is not well understood. RNA-binding motif protein 24 (RBM24) inhibits core translation by binding to the 5'-TR of pgRNA. Here, we demonstrate that RBM24 is also involved in pgRNA packaging. RBM24 directly binds to the lower bulge of ε via RNA recognition submotifs (RNPs). RBM24 also interacts with Pol in an RNA-independent manner. The alanine-rich domain (ARD) of RBM24 and the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of Pol are essential for binding between RBM24 and Pol. In addition, overexpression of RBM24 increases Pol-ε interaction, whereas RBM24 knockdown decreases the interaction. RBM24 was able to rescue binding between ε and mutant Pol lacking ε-binding activity, further showing that RBM24 mediates the interaction between Pol and ε by forming a Pol-RBM24-ε complex. Finally, RBM24 significantly promotes the packaging efficiency of pgRNA. In conclusion, RBM24 mediates Pol-ε interaction and formation of a Pol-RBM24-ε complex, which inhibits translation of pgRNA and results in pgRNA packing into capsids/virions for reverse transcription and DNA synthesis.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen, and HBV infection is a major global health burden. Chronic HBV infection is associated with the development of liver diseases, including fulminant hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A currently approved vaccine can prevent HBV infection, and medications are able to reduce viral loads and prevent liver disease progression. However, current treatments rarely achieve a cure for chronic infection. Thus, it is important to gain insight into the mechanisms of HBV replication. In this study, we found that the host factor RBM24 is involved in pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) packaging and regulates HBV replication. These findings highlight a potential target for antiviral therapeutics of HBV infection.
Eukaryotic mRNA precursors are co-transcriptionally assembled into ribonucleoprotein complexes. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes are involved in mRNA translocation, stability, subcellular localization and regulation of mRNA translation. About 20 major classes of hnRNPs have been identified in mammals. In a previous work, we characterized a novel, strongly-basic, RNA-binding protein (p65) in presynaptic terminals of squid neurons presenting homology with human hnRNPA/B type proteins, likely involved in local mRNA processing. We have identified and sequenced two hnRNPA/B-like proteins associated with tissue purified squid p65: Protein 1 (36.3 kDa, IP 7.1) and Protein 2 (37.6 kDa, IP 8.9). In the present work we generated an in silico, tridimensional, structural model of squid hnRNPA/B-like Protein 2, which showed highly conserved secondary and tertiary structure of RNA recognition motifs with human hnRNPA1 protein, as well as illustrated the potential for squid Protein 2 stable homodimerization. This was supported by biophysical measurements of bacterially expressed, recombinant protein. In addition, we induced expression of squid hnRNPA/B-like Protein 2 in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) and observed an exclusively nuclear localization, which depended on an intact C-terminal amino acid sequence and which relocated to cytoplasm particles containing PABP when the cells were challenged with sorbitol, suggesting an involvement with stress granule function.
Altered expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by environmental chemicals modulates the expression of xenobiotic biotransformation-related genes and may serve as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers of exposure. The pregnane X receptor (PXR/NR1I2) is a critical xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of many drug-processing genes, and it has similar target-gene profiles and DNA-binding motifs with another xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor, namely, constitutive andronstrane receptor (CAR/Nr1i3). To test our hypothesis that lncRNAs are regulated by PXR in concert with protein-coding genes (PCGs) and to compare the PXR-targeted lncRNAs with CAR-targeted lncRNAs, RNA-Seq was performed from livers of adult male C57BL/6 mice treated with corn oil, the PXR agonist PCN, or the CAR agonist 1, 4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP). Among 125,680 known lncRNAs, 3843 were expressed in liver, and 193 were differentially regulated by PXR (among which 40% were also regulated by CAR). Most PXR- or CAR-regulated lncRNAs were mapped to the introns and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of PCGs, as well as intergenic regions. Combining the RNA-Seq data with a published PXR chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing; cytochrome P450 (P450; ChIP-Seq) data set, we identified 774 expressed lncRNAs with direct PXR-DNA binding sites, and 26.8% of differentially expressed lncRNAs had changes in PXR-DNA binding after PCN exposure. De novo motif analysis identified colocalization of PXR with liver receptor homolog (LRH-1), which regulates bile acid synthesis after PCN exposure. There was limited overlap of PXR binding with an epigenetic mark for transcriptional activation (histone-H3K4-di-methylation, H3K4me2) but no overlap with epigenetic marks for transcriptional silencing [H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation]. Among differentially expressed lncRNAs, 264 were in proximity of PCGs, and the lncRNA-PCG pairs displayed a high coregulatory pattern by PXR and CAR activation. This study was among the first to demonstrate that lncRNAs are regulated by PXR and CAR activation and that they may be important regulators of PCGs involved in xenobiotic metabolism.
Argonaute proteins play important roles in gene regulation with small RNAs (sRNAs) serving as guides to targets. Argonautes are believed to bind sRNAs in a sequence non-specific manner. However, we recently discovered that Argonautes selectively load endogenous single-stranded (ss) RNAs, suggesting that Argonaute loading may conform to sequence specificity. To identify sequences preferred for Argonaute loading, we have developed HIgh-throughput Sequencing mediated Specificity Analysis (HISSA). HISSA allows massively parallel analysis of RNA binding efficiency by using randomized oligos in in vitro binding assays and quantifying RNAs by deep-sequencing. We chose Drosophila as a model system to take advantage of the presence of two biochemically distinct Argonautes, AGO1 and AGO2. Our results revealed AGO2 loading to be strongly favored by G-rich sequences. In contrast, AGO1 showed an enrichment of the 'GAC' motif in loaded species. Reanalysis of published sRNA sequencing data from fly tissues detected enrichment of the GAC motif in ssRNA-derived small RNAs in the immunopurified AGO1-complex under certain conditions, suggesting that the sequence preference of AGO1-loading may influence the repertoire of AGO1-bound endogenous sRNAs. Finally, we showed that human Ago2 also exhibited selectivity in loading ssRNAs in cell lysates. These findings may have implications for therapeutic ssRNA-mediated gene silencing.
The poly(A) RNA binding Zn finger ribonucleoprotein Nab2 functions to control the length of 3' poly(A) tails in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as contributing to the integration of the nuclear export of mature mRNA with preceding steps in the nuclear phase of the gene expression pathway. Nab2 is constructed from an N-terminal PWI-fold domain, followed by QQQP and RGG motifs and then seven CCCH Zn fingers. The nuclear pore-associated proteins Gfd1 and Mlp1 bind to opposite sides of the Nab2 N-terminal domain and function in the nuclear export of mRNA, whereas the Zn fingers, especially fingers 5-7, bind to A-rich regions of mature transcripts and function to regulate poly(A) tail length as well as mRNA compaction prior to nuclear export. Nab2 Zn fingers 5-7 have a defined spatial arrangement, with fingers 5 and 7 arranged on one side of the cluster and finger 6 on the other side. This spatial arrangement facilitates the dimerization of Nab2 when bound to adenine-rich RNAs and regulates both the termination of 3' polyadenylation and transcript compaction. Nab2 also functions to coordinate steps in the nuclear phase of the gene expression pathway, such as splicing and polyadenylation, with the generation of mature mRNA and its nuclear export. Nab2 orthologues in higher Eukaryotes have similar domain structures and play roles associated with the regulation of splicing and polyadenylation. Importantly, mutations in the gene encoding the human Nab2 orthologue ZC3H14 and cause intellectual disability.
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA modification in higher eukaryotes. Recent studies suggest that m6A has a regulatory role in mRNA degradation and translation initiation or efficiency, involving in cell fate determination in yeast, plants, and stem cells of mammalian. Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) regulates gene expression through post-transcriptional fashion, which heavily relies on mRNA cis-motifs. However, internal mRNA modification in T. brucei has not been reported yet. Here we found m6A modification is abundant in T. brucei and presented a transcriptome wide methylome of m6A in both life stages of T. brucei. We identified 355 and 95 peaks in procyclic form and blood stream form trypanosomes respectively. A consensus motif of CAU was shared in both life stages of T. brucei. mRNA abundance of m6A-containing genes is higher in procyclic form and tend to be down-regulated in bloodstream form trypanosomes. Furthermore, m6A-containing transcripts harbor relative longer half-lives, and are enriched in pathways of cell morphology and movement in procyclic form trypanosomes. By m6A-containing RNA pulldown in both life stages, we identified TRRM2 as a potential m6A reader in T. brucei. Uncovering the m6A methylome and its binding proteins may provide a new post-transcriptional regulatory pathway in T. brucei.
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are higher order assemblies of RNA, RNA-binding proteins, and other proteins, that regulate the transcriptome and protect RNAs from environmental challenge. There is a diverse range of RNP granules, many cytoplasmic, which provide various levels of regulation of RNA metabolism. Here we present evidence that the yeast transcription termination factor, Nab3, is targeted to intranuclear granules in response to glucose starvation by Nab3's proline/glutamine-rich, prion-like domain (PrLD) which can assemble into amyloid in vitro. Localization to the granule is reversible and sensitive to the chemical probe 1,6 hexanediol suggesting condensation is driven by phase separation. Nab3's RNA recognition motif is also required for localization as seen for other PrLD-containing RNA-binding proteins that phase separate. Although the PrLD is necessary, it is not sufficient to localize to the granule. A heterologous PrLD that functionally replaces Nab3's essential PrLD, directed localization to the nuclear granule, however a chimeric Nab3 molecule with a heterologous PrLD that cannot restore termination function or viability, does not form granules. The Nab3 nuclear granule shows properties similar to well characterized cytoplasmic compartments formed by phase separation, suggesting that, as seen for other elements of the transcription machinery, termination factor condensation is functionally important.
Stress-induced misfolding and intraneuronal aggregation of the highly conserved nucleic acid binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa) and its fragments have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and several other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the physicochemical mechanism of its misfolding from the functional folded state is poorly understood. TDP-43 is a four-domain protein and performs the essential nucleic acid binding function with the help of its two tandem RNA recognition motif domains naturally tethered by a linker (called here the tethered RRM domain of TDP-43 or TDP-43tRRM). Here, we show that the monomeric native form of TDP-43tRRM remains in a pH-dependent and reversible thermodynamic equilibrium with a protonated, nanosized, 40-meric form (the A form). Under the stress-like low-pH condition, the A form becomes predominantly populated. In the A form, protein molecules have restricted dynamics of surface side-chain residues but native-like secondary structure. This self-assembled form possesses a loosely packed core in which the intrinsically disordered and aggregation-prone regions are in the proximity. The A form is metastable and swiftly aggregates into a highly stable amyloid-like protofibrillar form (β form) mediated by the disorder-to-order transition of intrinsically disordered regions upon small environmental perturbations. Interestingly, the A form and the β form are not formed when TDP-43tRRM is bound to DNA, indicating that the nucleic acid binding regions of the protein participate in their formation. Our results reveal how the energy landscapes of folding and aggregation of TDP-43tRRM are coupled by a metastable molten-globule like oligomeric form and modulated by stress-like conditions.
Plant cold shock domain proteins (CSDPs) are DNA/RNA-binding proteins. CSDPs contain the conserved cold shock domain (CSD) in the N-terminal part and a varying number of the CCHC-type zinc finger (ZnF) motifs alternating with glycine-rich regions in the C-terminus. CSDPs exhibit RNA chaperone and RNA-melting activities due to their nonspecific interaction with RNA. At the same time, there are reasons to believe that CSDPs also interact with specific RNA targets. In the present study, we used three recombinant CSDPs from the saltwater cress plant (Eutrema salsugineum) - EsCSDP1, EsCSDP2, EsCSDP3 with 6, 2, and 7 ZnF motifs, respectively, and showed that their nonspecific interaction with RNA is determined by their C-terminal fragments. All three proteins exhibited high affinity to the single-stranded regions over four nucleotides long within RNA oligonucleotides. The presence of guanine in the single- or double-stranded regions was crucial for the interaction with CSDPs. Complementation test using E. coli BX04 cells lacking four cold shock protein genes (ΔcspA, ΔcspB, ΔcspE, ΔcspG) revealed that the specific binding of plant CSDPs with RNA is determined by CSD.
Viruses utilize a number of host factors in order to carry out their replication cycles. Influenza A virus (IAV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both infect the tissues of the respiratory tract, and as such we hypothesize that they might require similar host factors. Several published genome-wide screens have identified putative IAV host factors; however, there is significant discordance between their hits. In order to build on this work, we integrated a variety of "OMICS" data sources using two complementary network analyses, yielding 51 genes enriched for both IAV and RSV replication. We designed a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based assay to screen these genes against IAV under robust conditions and identified 13 genes supported by two IAV subtypes in both primary and transformed human lung cells. One of these hits, RNA binding motif 14 (RBM14), was validated as a required host factor and furthermore was shown to relocalize to the nucleolus upon IAV infection but not with other viruses. Additionally, the IAV NS1 protein is both necessary and sufficient for RBM14 relocalization, and relocalization also requires the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding capacity of NS1. This work reports the discovery of a new host requirement for IAV replication and exposes a novel example of interplay between IAV NS1 and the host protein, RBM14.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) present major global disease burdens. There are high economic costs associated with morbidity as well as significant mortality rates, especially in developing countries, in children, and in the elderly. There are currently limited therapeutic options for these viruses, which underscores the need for novel research into virus biology that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. This work extends existing research into host factors involved in virus replication and explores the interaction between IAV and one such host factor, RBM14. Further study to fully characterize this interaction may elucidate novel mechanisms used by the virus during its replication cycle and open new avenues for understanding virus biology.
The antifungal agent 6-aminocholestanol targets the production of ergosterol, which is the principle sterol in many fungi and protozoans; ergosterol serves many of the same roles as cholesterol in animals. We found that it also is an effective inhibitor of the translation-initiation factor eIF4AI from mouse (eIF4AIMus) and the Trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania (LieIF4A). The eIF4A proteins belong to the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases, which are ATP-dependent RNA-binding proteins and RNA-dependent ATPases. DEAD-box proteins contain a commonly-shared core structure consisting of two linked domains with structural homology to that of recombinant protein A (RecA) and that contain conserved motifs that are involved in RNA and ATP binding, and in the enzymatic activity. The compound inhibits both the ATPase and helicase activities by perturbing ATP and RNA binding, and it is capable of binding other proteins containing nucleic acid-binding sites as well. We undertook kinetic analyses and found that the Leishmania LieIF4A protein binds 6-aminocholestanol with a higher apparent affinity than for ATP, although multiple binding sites were probably involved. Competition experiments with the individual RecA-like domains indicate that the primary binding sites are on RecA-like domain 1, and they include a cavity that we previously identified by molecular modeling of LieIF4A that involve conserved RNA-binding motifs. The compound affects the mammalian and Leishmania proteins differently, which indicates the binding sites and affinities are not the same. Thus, it is possible to develop drugs that target DEAD-box proteins from different organisms even when they are implicated in the same biological process.
MicroRNA (miRNA/miR)-124 is a miRNA, which exerts tumor suppressive effects but is frequently absent in tumors. Although it has been validated to target oncogenic genes such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, forkhead box Q1, and Slug, the mechanistic link between miR‑124 and potential target genes that contribute to tumor progression, is yet to be investigated. IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein that participates in protein‑protein interactions and integrating diverse signaling pathways. Previous studies suggest that overexpression of IQGAP1 enhances activity of mitogen activated protein kinase 1 and β‑catenin signaling cascades to facilitate tumor progression. The present study aimed to identify the regulative link between miR‑124 and IQGAP1 in colorectal cancer (CRC). It was demonstrated that IQGAP1 was aberrantly overexpressed in CRC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of IQGPA1 by introducing short hairpin‑IQGAP1 lentivirus inhibited CRC cell growth and colony formation ability, and simultaneously suppressed phosphorylation of extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and β‑catenin expression. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that miR‑124 was silenced in CRC. Restoration of miR‑124 in CRC cells impeded cell growth and colony formation ability. The direct binding of miR‑124 to the 3'untranslated region of IQGAP1 mRNA was confirmed using a luciferase reporter gene assay. Importantly, downregulation of IQGAP1 expression was observed in miR‑124‑restoration cells with simultaneous reduction of phosphorylated‑ERK1/2 and β‑catenin. In conclusion, the present study describes a potential mechanism underlying the miR‑124/IQGAP1 link in CRC progression. Silencing of miR‑124 may depress IQGAP1 expression, leading to increased activity of ERK1/2 and β‑catenin signaling.
Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is one of the most common types of malignancy in males and at present, effective prognostic indicators are limited. The development of PRAD has been associated with abnormalities in alternative splicing (AS), a requisite biological process of gene expression in eukaryotic cells; however, the prognostic value of AS products and splicing events remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the data of splicing events and the clinical information of PRAD patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)SpliceSeq and TCGA databases, respectively. A prognostic index (PI) was generated from disease-free survival-associated splicing events (DFS-SEs), which were identified by univariate/multivariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 6,909 DFS-SEs were identified in PRAD. The corresponding genes for the DFS-SEs were significantly enriched in mitochondria and their associated pathways according to Gene Ontology annotation and in the pathways of fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and Huntington's disease according to a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. The PI for mutually exclusive exons had the greatest ability to predict the probability of five-year disease-free survival of patients with PRAD, with an area under the time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.7606. Patients with PRAD, when divided into a 'low' and a 'high' group based on their median PI for exon skip values, exhibited a marked difference in disease-free survival (low vs. high, 3,588.45±250.51 vs. 1,531.08±136.50 days; P=7.43x10-9). A correlation network between DFS-SEs of splicing factors and non-splicing factors was constructed to determine the potential mechanisms in PRAD, which included the potential regulatory interaction between the splicing event of splicing factor RNA binding motif protein 5-alternate terminator (AT)-64957 and the splicing event of non-splicing factor heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3-AT-939. In conclusion, the PIs derived from DFS-SEs are valuable prognostic factors for patients with PRAD, and the function of splicing events in PRAD deserves further exploration.
Our previous study found that more than 500 transcripts significantly increased in abundance in the zebrafish and mouse several hours to days postmortem relative to live controls. The current literature suggests that most mRNAs are post-transcriptionally regulated in stressful conditions. We rationalized that the postmortem transcripts must contain sequence features (3- to 9- mers) that are unique from those in the rest of the transcriptome and that these features putatively serve as binding sites for proteins and/or non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation.
We identified 5117 and 2245 over-represented sequence features in the mouse and zebrafish, respectively, which represents less than 1.5% of all possible features. Some of these features were disproportionately distributed along the transcripts with high densities in the 3' untranslated regions of the zebrafish (0.3 mers/nt) and the open reading frames of the mouse (0.6 mers/nt). Yet, the highest density (2.3 mers/nt) occurred in the open reading frames of 11 mouse transcripts that lacked 3' or 5' untranslated regions. These results suggest the transcripts with high density of features might serve as 'molecular sponges' that sequester RNA binding proteins and/or microRNAs, and thus indirectly increase the stability and gene expression of other transcripts. In addition, some of the features were identified as binding sites for Rbfox and Hud proteins that are also involved in increasing transcript stability and gene expression.
Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcripts involved in responding to extreme stress, such as organismal death, have sequence features that make them different from the rest of the transcriptome. Some of these features serve as putative binding sites for proteins and non-coding RNAs that determine transcript stability and fate. A small number of the transcripts have high density sequence features, which are presumably involved in sequestering RNA binding proteins and microRNAs and thus preventing regulatory interactions among other transcripts. Our results provide baseline data on post-transcriptional regulation in stressful conditions that has implications for regulation in disease, starvation, and cancer.
A newly isolated binding protein of peroxisomal targeting signal type 2 (PTS2) receptor Pex7, termed P7BP2, is transported into peroxisomes by binding to the longer isoform of Pex5p, Pex5pL, via Pex7p. The binding to Pex7p and peroxisomal localization of P7BP2 depends on the cleavable PTS2 in the N-terminal region, suggesting that P7BP2 is a new PTS2 protein. By search on human database, three AAA+ domains are found in the N-terminal half of P7BP2. Protein sequence alignment and motif search reveal that in the C-terminal region P7BP2 contains additional structural domains featuring weak but sufficient homology to AAA+ domain. P7BP2 behaves as a monomer in gel-filtration chromatography and the single molecule observed under atomic force microscope shapes a disc-like ring. Collectively, these results suggest that P7BP2 is a novel dynein-type AAA+ family protein, of which domains are arranged into a pseudo-hexameric ring structure.
A comprehensive knowledge of the platelet proteome is necessary for understanding thrombosis and for envisioning antiplatelet therapies. To discover other biochemical pathways in human platelets, we screened platelets with a carbamate library designed to interrogate the serine hydrolase subproteome and used competitive activity-based protein profiling to map the targets of active carbamates. We identified an inhibitor that targets arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1 (AADACL1), a lipid deacetylase originally identified in invasive cancers. Using this compound, along with highly selective second-generation inhibitors of AADACL1, metabolomics, and RNA interference, we show that AADACL1 regulates platelet aggregation, thrombus growth, RAP1 and PKC activation, lipid metabolism, and fibrinogen binding to platelets and megakaryocytes. These data provide evidence that AADACL1 regulates platelet and megakaryocyte activation and highlight the value of this chemoproteomic strategy for target discovery in platelets. 
Crusted or Norwegian scabies is an infectious skin dermatopathology usually associated with an underlying immunodeficiency condition. It is caused when the mite Sarcoptes scabiei infects the skin, and the immune system is unable to control its spread, leading to a massive hyperinfestation with a simultaneous inflammatory and hyperkeratotic reaction. This is the first report of a novel 1p36 duplication associated with a recurrent infection of crusted scabies.
We describe a 34-year-old patient with a cutaneous immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent crusted scabies infestation, diffuse tinea, and recurrent staphylococcal cellulitis, who we suspected had an undiagnosed syndrome. The patient also suffered from mental retardation, renal failure, and premature senescence. A cytogenetic fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed a 9.34 Mb duplication within the short (p) arm of chromosome 1, precisely from 1p36.11 to 1p36.21, with an adjacent 193 kb copy gain entirely within 1p36.11. In addition, chromosome 4 had a 906 kb gain in 4p16.1 and chromosome 9 had a 81 kb copy gain in 9p24.3. Over 100 genes localized within these duplicated regions. Gene expression array revealed 82 genes whose expression changed &gt;1.5-fold compared to a healthy age-matched skin control, but among them only the lipolytic enzyme arylacetamide deacetylase-like 3 was found within the duplicated 1p36 region of chromosome 1.
Although genetic duplications in the 1p36 region have been previously described, our report describes a novel duplicative variant within the 1p36 region. The patient did not have a past history of immunosuppression but was afflicted by a recurrent case of crusted scabies, raising the possibility that the recurrent infection was associated with the 1p36 genetic duplication.
To our knowledge, the specific duplicated sequence between 1p36.11 and p36.21 found in our patient has never been previously reported. We reviewed and compared the clinical, genotyping, and gene microarray results of our patient in order to characterize this novel 1p36 duplication syndrome, which might have contributed to the recurrent scabies infection in this patient.
Cholesterol plays a key role in membrane protein function and signaling in endothelial cells. Thus, disturbing cholesterol trafficking is an effective approach for inhibiting angiogenesis. We recently identified astemizole (AST), an antihistamine drug, as a cholesterol trafficking inhibitor from a phenotypic screen. In this study, we found that AST induced cholesterol accumulation in the lysosome by binding to the sterol-sensing domain of Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal surface protein responsible for cholesterol transport. Inhibition of cholesterol trafficking by AST led to the depletion of membrane cholesterol, causing SREBP1 nuclear localization. The depletion of membrane cholesterol resulted in dissociation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) from the lysosomal surface and inactivation of mTOR signaling. These effects were effectively rescued by addition of exogenous cholesterol. AST inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Furthermore, AST inhibited zebrafish angiogenesis in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Together, our data suggest that AST is a new class of NPC1 antagonist that inhibits cholesterol trafficking in endothelial cells and angiogenesis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lysosomal storage disorder with severe prognosis. Disease-specific therapy is crucial to prevent disease progression; however, diagnosing NPC is quite difficult because of remarkably variable clinical presentations. The NPC Suspicion Index (NPC-SI) was developed to overcome this problem. Identifying preclinical cases is important for prevention and therapy. Here, we report three newly diagnosed NPC cases, one typical juvenile-onset case and the cases of two sisters with symptoms neurologically/psychiatrically indistinguishable from dystonia and schizophrenia, respectively.
In Case 1, a 25-year-old man presented with a 14-year history of intellectual disability, clumsiness, spastic ataxia, dysphagia, and frequent falls. Neurological examination revealed vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and involuntary movements. Ultrasonography revealed mild splenomegaly, and filipin staining of skin fibroblasts was positive with a variant staining pattern. NPC1 gene analysis showed compound heterozygous mutations, including c.1421C &gt; T (p.P474L), a known causative mutation, and c.3722 T &gt; C (p.L1241S), a new mutation. In Case 2, a 28-year-old woman, the proband, who had marked splenomegaly in her childhood, survived well, contrary to the expected severe prognosis of infantile NPC. She had minor neuropsychiatric symptoms including auditory hallucinations, nocturnal urination, and sleep paralysis. At the age of 28 years, she presented with a 1-year history of orofacial and oromandibular painful dystonia. The patient's 35-year-old sister (Case 3) was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In both cases, filipin staining of skin fibroblasts was positive with variant staining patterns, as well as elevated levels of urinary bile acids. NPC1 gene analysis showed compound heterozygous mutations including c.3011C &gt; T (p.S1004 L), a known causative mutation, and c.160_161insG (p.D54GfsX4), a new mutation. Their mother, who was under therapy with modafinil for narcolepsy, shared the latter mutation.
Marked clinical variability was observed in our three cases. NPC could masquerade as a pure neuropsychiatric disorder such as dystonia or schizophrenia. Abdominal ultrasonography, history evaluation, and neurological examination were quite important in the diagnostic process.
Hypercholesterolaemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we tested whether cholesterol-mediated neurodegeneration induced either by cholesterol-rich diet or genetic mutation may share a common mechanism involving increased oxidative stress and mitochondria oxidant status. Additionally, we analysed whether upon cholesterol-rich diet, different brain regions (prefrontal cortex, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) show distinct vulnerability to an oxidative stress response.
Oxidative stress parameters were measured both in vivo (in the liver and in different brain regions) in cholesterol-fed mice and in vitro in genetically induced cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-null cells.
Increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was a common feature of cholesterol-mediated antioxidant response in both models. Moreover, upon high-cholesterol diet, all four brain regions analysed responded via somewhat different capacity of antioxidant defence, hippocampus showing the highest basal activity of SOD. Increased activity of SOD upon cholesterol accumulation in vitro involves mitochondrial SOD2. We found that SOD/SOD2 activities are modulated by cholesterol levels.
Hypercholesterolaemia could potentiate brain dysfunction and neurodegenerative processes via oxidative stress, and activity of mitochondrial SOD2 may play a key role in this process. Our findings suggest that preventing/reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress may represent a common approach against neurodegenerative diseases.
Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) is a lysosome luminal protein that functions in concert with NPC1 to mediate egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from lysosome. The nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NF-κB2) protein is a component of NF-κB transcription factor complex critically implicated in immune and inflammatory responses. Here, we report that NF-κB2 regulates intracellular cholesterol transport by controlling NPC2 expression. RNAi-mediated disruption of NF-κB2, as well as other signaling members of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, caused intracellular cholesterol accumulation. Blockage of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway suppressed NPC2 expression, whereas Lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) activation or Baff receptor (BaffR) stimulation up-regulated the mRNA abundance and protein level of NPC2. Further, NF-κB2 activated NPC2 transcription through direct binding to its promoter region. We also observed cholesterol accumulation in NF-κB2-deficient zebrafish embryo and NF-κB2 mutant mice. Collectively, these data identify a regulatory role for the non-canonical NF-κB pathway in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and suggest a link between cholesterol transport and immune system.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in either NPC-1 or NPC-2 genes, resulting in abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking. The estimated prevalence of NPC disease is 1: 120,000-150,000. Lung involvement has been described in only few patients with NPC, mostly NPC2. We describe a series of 12 patients, originating from six families all homozygotes to the p.R404Q (c.1211G &gt; A) mutation of NPC1 gene; nine of them had significant pulmonary manifestations. All patients were followed in our medical center. Nine of the patients had pulmonary involvement, with recurrent pneumonia as the first manifestation in most, followed by recurrent wheezing episodes and subsequent development of interstitial lung disease with chronic need for oxygen support. Seven patients were reported of having interstitial disease by various imaging modalities.Conclusion: Pulmonary involvement in NPC1 is more common than previously reported. It is characterized as primary obstructive and restrictive lung disease and not only as part of neurologic sequel of NPC. It can lead to respiratory insufficiency and death from respiratory failure. What is Known: • Lung involvement has been described in only few patients with NPC. • Most reported NPC cases with pulmonary involvement were of NPC2. What is New: • Pulmonary involvement in NPC1 is more common than previously reported. • Pulmonary involvement in NPC1 should be considered as part of the disease and be thoroughly assessed and managed.
Cellular lipids determine membrane integrity and fluidity and are being increasingly recognized to influence immune responses. Cellular cholesterol requirements are fulfilled through biosynthesis and uptake programs. In an intricate pathway involving the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1, the sterol gets unequally distributed across intracellular compartments. By using pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting NPC1, we reveal that blockade of cholesterol trafficking through the late endosome-lysosome pathway blunts NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Altered cholesterol localization at the plasma membrane (PM) in Npc1-/- cells abrogated AKT-mTOR signaling by TLR4. However, the inability to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome was traced to perturbed cholesterol trafficking to the ER but not the PM. Accordingly, acute cholesterol depletion in the ER membranes by statins abrogated casp-1 activation and IL-1β secretion and ablated NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. By contrast, assembly and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome progressed unrestricted. Together, this study reveals ER sterol levels as a metabolic rheostat for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a polytopic membrane protein with 13 transmembrane helices that exports LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes by carrying it through the 80 Å glycocalyx and the 40 Å lipid bilayer. Transport begins when cholesterol binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which projects to the surface of the glycocalyx. Here, we reconstitute cholesterol transport by expressing the NTD as a fragment separate from the remaining portion of NPC1. When co-expressed, the two NPC1 fragments reconstitute cholesterol transport, indicating that the NTD has the flexibility to interact with the remaining parts of NPC1 even when not covalently linked. We also show that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one full-length NPC1 to another NPC1 molecule that lacks the NTD. These data support the hypothesis that cholesterol is transported through interactions between two or more NPC1 molecules.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a neurovisceral disorder associated with the accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids. NPC is caused by either NPC1 or NPC2, which encode lysosomal proteins located at membraneous and soluble fractions, respectively. For the past decade, the oxidation products of cholesterol, such as cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol and 7-ketocholesterol, have been considered selective biomarkers for NPC. However, recent evidence has indicated numerous novel biomarkers for NPC, which raises the possibility that the diagnosis of NPC might be associated with the elevation of multiple lipid biomarkers, rather than a single biomarker. Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) has been suggested to be one such biomarker for NPC, in which elevated sphingomyelin is a potential precursor. Thus, we first performed a validation study of plasma SPC using LC-MS/MS. The results showed the following plasma concentrations in the NPC-affected and control individuals, respectively: 8.2 ± 2.8 nM (mean ± SD; median, 7.0 nM; max, 11.7 nM; min, 5.1 nM; n = 5) and 3.1 ± 1.4 nM (median, 2.9 nM; max, 4.8 nM; min, 1.5 nM; n = 7). We further extended the study to plasma lysophingomyelin-509 for NPC, a newly reported biomarker with uncharacterized chemical nature. Based on these result with plasma SPC as a surrogate marker, the value of mean of median of plasma lysophingomyelin-509 in NPC-affected individuals elevated at 65.2 (max, 73.2; min, 26.7; n = 5). Furthermore, the efficacy of plasma SPC and lysosphingomyelin-509 as promising biomarkers for this disorder was supported by the finding that the urinary concentration of 3β-sulfooxy-7β-N-acetylglucosaminyl-5-cholen-24-oic acid, an established biomarker for NPC, was also elevated in the NPC-affected individuals. These results suggest that a novel combination of plasma biomarkers, such as SPC and/or lysophingomyelin-509, and urinary bile acid metabolite could offer a promising platform for the diagnosis of NPC.
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a host receptor involved in the envelope glycoprotein (GP)-mediated entry of filoviruses into cells, is believed to be a major determinant of cell susceptibility to filovirus infection. It is known that proteolytically digested Ebola virus (EBOV) GP interacts with 2 protruding loops in domain C of NPC1. Using previously published structural data and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) database, we identified 10 naturally occurring missense SNPs in human NPC1. To investigate whether these SNPs affect cell susceptibility to filovirus infection, we generated Vero E6 cell lines stably expressing NPC1 with SNP substitutions and compared their susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with filovirus GPs and infectious EBOV. We found that some of the substitutions resulted in reduced susceptibility to filoviruses, as indicated by the lower titers and smaller plaque/focus sizes of the viruses. Our data suggest that human NPC1 SNPs may likely affect host susceptibility to filoviruses.
Hedgehog (HH) signalling governs embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis in mammals and other multicellular organisms1-3. Whereas deficient HH signalling leads to birth defects, unrestrained HH signalling is implicated in human cancers2,4-6. N-terminally palmitoylated HH releases the repression of Patched to the oncoprotein smoothened (SMO); however, the mechanism by which HH recognizes Patched is unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human patched 1 (PTCH1) alone and in complex with the N-terminal domain of 'native' sonic hedgehog (native SHH-N has both a C-terminal cholesterol and an N-terminal fatty-acid modification), at resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively. The structure of PTCH1 has internal two-fold pseudosymmetry in the transmembrane core, which features a sterol-sensing domain and two homologous extracellular domains, resembling the architecture of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein7. The palmitoylated N terminus of SHH-N inserts into a cavity between the extracellular domains of PTCH1 and dominates the PTCH1-SHH-N interface, which is distinct from that reported for SHH-N co-receptors8. Our biochemical assays show that SHH-N may use another interface, one that is required for its co-receptor binding, to recruit PTCH1 in the absence of a covalently attached palmitate. Our work provides atomic insights into the recognition of the N-terminal domain of HH (HH-N) by PTCH1, offers a structural basis for cooperative binding of HH-N to various receptors and serves as a molecular framework for HH signalling and its malfunction in disease.
It is intriguing that a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) shares similarities with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously reported an enhanced processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD, in NPC1-null cells. In this work, we characterized regional and temporal expression and processing of the recently identified BACE1 substrates seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), and APP, in NPC1-/- (NPC1) and NPC1+/+ (wt) mouse brains. We analysed 4-weeks old brains to detect the earliest changes associated with NPC, and 10-weeks of age to identify changes at terminal disease stage. Sez6 and Sez6L were selected due to their predominant cleavage by BACE1, and their potential role in synaptic function that may contribute to presentation of seizures and/or motor impairments in NPC patients. While an enhanced BACE1-cleavage of all three substrates was detected in NPC1 vs. wt-mouse brains at 4-weeks of age, at 10-weeks increased proteolysis by BACE1 was observed for Sez6L in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of NPC1-mice. Interestingly, both APP and Sez6L were found to be expressed in Purkinje neurons and their immunostaining was lost upon Purkinje cell neurodegeneration in 10-weeks old NPC1 mice. Furthermore, in NPC1- vs. wt-mouse primary cortical neurons, both Sez6 and Sez6L showed increased punctuate staining within the endolysosomal pathway as well as increased Sez6L and BACE1-positive puncta. This indicates that a trafficking defect within the endolysosomal pathway may play a key role in enhanced BACE1-proteolysis in NPC disease. Overall, our findings suggest that enhanced proteolysis by BACE1 could be a part of NPC disease pathogenesis. Understanding the basic biology of BACE1 and the functional impact of cleavage of its substrates is important to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of BACE1 against AD and, possibly, NPC disease.
Adult-onset Niemann-Pick Type C is a rare neurogenetic lysosomal disorder, whose diagnosis is often delayed and missed because of its heterogeneous clinical presentations and rarity as well as the lack of awareness of characteristic eye findings among neurologists.
Impaired smooth pursuits, saccades, and optokinetic nystagmus in the vertical direction, with relatively normal eye movements in the horizontal direction, and ataxia features on finger chase testing, tandem walking, and gait ataxia.
Impairment of vertical eye movements in combination with ataxia, cognitive impairment, and/or psychiatric symptoms in an adult patient should always raise clinical suspicion of Niemann-Pick Type C.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutation of Npc1 or Npc2 gene, resulting in various progressive pathological features. Myelin defection is a major pathological problem in Npc1 mutant mice; however, impairment of myelin proteins in the developing brain is still incompletely understood. In this study, we showed that the expression of myelin genes and proteins is strongly inhibited from postnatal day 35 onwards including reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the brain. Furthermore, myelination characterized by MBP immunohistochemistry was strongly perturbed in the forebrain, moderately in the midbrain and cerebellum, and slightly in the hindbrain. Our results demonstrate that mutation of the Npc1 gene is sufficient to cause severe and progressive defects in myelination in the mouse brain.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a neurovisceral lipid storage disorder. At the cellular level, the disorder is characterized by accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosomal/late endosomal system. NP-C is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in either the NPC1 (95% of families) or NPC2 gene. The estimated disease incidence is 1 in 120,000 live births, but this likely represents an underestimate, as the disease may be under-diagnosed due to its highly heterogeneous presentation. Variants of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subunit 6 and ATPase subunit 8 (ATPase6/8) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported in different types of genetic diseases including NP-C. In the present study, the blood samples of 22 Iranian patients with NP-C and 150 healthy subjects as a control group were analyzed. The DNA of the blood samples was extracted by the salting out method and analyzed for ATPase6/8 mutations using polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Sequence variations in mitochondrial genome samples were determined via the Mitomap database. Analysis of sequencing data confirmed the existence of 11 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with NP-C1. One of the most prevalent polymorphisms was the A8860G variant, which was observed in both affected and non-affected groups and determined to have no significant association with NP-C incidence. Amongst the 11 polymorphisms, only one was identified in the ATPase8 gene, while 9 including A8860G were observed in the ATPase6 gene. Furthermore, two SNPs, G8292A and C8792A, located in the non-coding region of mtDNA and the ATPase6 gene, respectively, exhibited significantly higher prevalence rates in NP-C1 patients compared with the control group (P&lt;0.01). The present study suggests that there may be an association between mitochondrial ATPase6/8 mutations and the incidence of NP-C disease. In addition, the mitochondrial SNPs identified maybe pathogenic mutations involved in the development and prevalence of NP-C. Furthermore, these results suggest a higher occurrence of mutations in ATPase6 than in ATPase8 in NP-C patients.
Previous studies identified an adamantane dipeptide piperazine 3.47 that inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) infection by targeting the essential receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). The physicochemical properties of 3.47 limit its potential for testing in vivo. Optimization by improving potency, reducing hydrophobicity, and replacing labile moieties identified 3.47 derivatives with improved in vitro ADME properties that are also highly active against EBOV infection, including when tested in the presence of 50% normal human serum (NHS). In addition, 3A4 was identified as the major cytochrome P450 isoform that metabolizes these compounds, and accordingly, mouse microsome stability was significantly improved when tested in the presence of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir that is approved for clinical use as a booster of anti-HIV drugs. Oral administration of the EBOV inhibitors with ritonavir resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile that supports a b.i.d. dosing regimen for efficacy studies in mice.
Approximately 70 lysosomal storage diseases are currently known, resulting from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes and membrane proteins. Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of β-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages ('Gaucher cells') have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare human disease, with limited effective treatment options. Most cases of NPC disease are associated with inactivating mutations of the NPC1 gene. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the NPC1 pathogenesis remain poorly defined. This is partly due to the lack of a suitable animal model to monitor the disease progression. In this study, we used CRISPR to construct an NPC1-/- zebrafish model, which faithfully reproduced the cardinal pathological features of this disease. In contrast to the wild type (WT), the deletion of NPC1 alone caused significant hepatosplenomegaly, ataxia, Purkinje cell death, increased lipid storage, infertility and reduced body length and life span. Most of the NPC1-/- zebrafish died within the first month post fertilization, while the remaining specimens developed slower than the WT and died before reaching 8 months of age. Filipin-stained hepatocytes of the NPC1-/- zebrafish were clear, indicating abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Lipid profiling showed a significant difference between NPC1-/- and WT zebrafish. An obvious accumulation of seven sphingolipids was detected in livers of NPC1-/- zebrafish. In summary, our results provide a valuable model system that could identify promising therapeutic targets and treatments for the NPC disease.
Cholesteryl esters are generated at multiple sites in the body by sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT) 1 or SOAT2 in various cell types and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase in plasma. Esterified cholesterol and triacylglycerol contained in lipoproteins cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated or bulk-phase endocytosis are hydrolyzed by lysosomal acid lipase within the late endosomal/lysosomal (E/L) compartment. Then, through the successive actions of Niemann-Pick C (NPC) 2 and NPC 1, unesterified cholesterol (UC) is exported from the E/L compartment to the cytosol. Mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 lead to continuing entrapment of UC in all organs, resulting in multisystem disease, which includes hepatic dysfunction and in some cases liver failure. These studies investigated primarily whether elimination of SOAT2 in NPC1-deficient mice impacted hepatic UC sequestration, inflammation, and transaminase activities. Measurements were made in 7-wk-old mice fed a low-cholesterol chow diet or one enriched with cholesterol starting 2 wk before study. In the chow-fed mice, NPC1:SOAT2 double knockouts, compared with their littermates lacking only NPC1, had 20% less liver mass, 28% lower hepatic UC concentrations, and plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities that were decreased by 48% and 36%, respectively. mRNA expression levels for several markers of inflammation were all significantly lower in the NPC1 mutants lacking SOAT2. The existence of a new class of potent and selective SOAT2 inhibitors provides an opportunity for exploring if suppression of this enzyme could potentially become an adjunctive therapy for liver disease in NPC1 deficiency. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY In Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, the entrapment of unesterified cholesterol (UC) in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment of all cells causes multiorgan disease, including neurodegeneration, pulmonary dysfunction, and liver failure. Some of this sequestered UC entered cells initially in the esterified form. When sterol O-acyltransferase 2, a cholesterol esterifying enzyme present in enterocytes and hepatocytes, is eliminated in NPC1-deficient mice, there is a reduction in their hepatomegaly, hepatic UC content, and cellular injury.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C) is a fatal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused in 95% of cases by a mutation in the NPC1 gene that encodes NPC1, an integral transmembrane protein localized to the limiting membrane of the lysosome. There is no cure for NP-C but there is a disease-modifying drug (miglustat) that slows disease progression but with associated side effects. Here, we demonstrate in a well-characterized mouse model of NP-C that a single administration of AAV-mediated gene therapy to the brain can significantly extend lifespan, improve quality of life, prevent or ameliorate neurodegeneration, reduce biochemical pathology and normalize or improve various indices of motor function. Over-expression of human NPC1 does not cause adverse effects in the brain and correctly localizes to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Furthermore, we directly compare gene therapy to licensed miglustat. Even at a low dose, gene therapy has all the benefits of miglustat but without adverse effects. On the basis of these findings and on-going ascendency of the field, we propose intracerebroventricular gene therapy as a potential therapeutic option for clinical use in NP-C.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the NPC1 or the NPC2 gene. Neurocognitive deficits are common in NP-C, particularly in patients with the adolescent/adult-onset form. As a disease-specific therapy is available, it is important to distinguish clinically between the cognitive profiles in NP-C and primary dementia (e.g., early Alzheimer's disease; eAD).
In a prospective observational study, we directly compared the neurocognitive profiles of patients with confirmed NP-C (n = 7) and eAD (n = 15). All patients underwent neurocognitive assessment using dementia screening tests (mini-mental status examination [MMSE] and frontal assessment battery [FAB]) and an extensive battery of tests assessing verbal memory, visuoconstructive abilities, visual memory, executive functions and verbal fluency.
Overall cognitive impairment (MMSE) was significantly greater in eAD vs. NP-C (p = 0.010). The frequency of patients classified as cognitively 'impaired' was also significantly greater in eAD vs. NP-C (p = 0.025). Patients with NP-C showed relatively preserved verbal memory, but frequent impairment in visual memory, visuoconstruction, executive functions and in particular, verbal fluency. In the eAD group, a wider profile of more frequent and more severe neurocognitive deficits was seen, primarily featuring severe verbal and visual memory deficits along with major executive impairment. Delayed verbal memory recall was a particularly strong distinguishing factor between the two groups.
A combination of detailed yet easy-to-apply neurocognitive tests assessing verbal memory, executive functions and verbal fluency may help distinguish NP-C cases from those with primary dementia due to eAD.
Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disease with its monogenic forms accounting for less than 10% of all cases. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) technology has been used successfully to find mutations in large families. However, because of the late onset of the disease, only small families and unrelated patients are usually available. WES conducted in such cases yields in a large number of candidate variants. There are currently a number of imperfect software tools that allow the pathogenicity of variants to be evaluated. Objectives: We analyzed 48 unrelated patients with an alleged autosomal dominant familial form of PD using WES and developed a strategy for selecting potential pathogenetically significant variants using almost all available bioinformatics resources for the analysis of exonic areas. Methods: DNA sequencing of 48 patients with excluded frequent mutations was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The possible pathogenetic significance of identified variants and their involvement in the pathogenesis of PD was assessed using SNP and Variation Suite (SVS), Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) and Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL) software. Functional evaluation was performed using the Pathway Studio database. Results: A significant reduction in the search range from 7082 to 25 variants in 23 genes associated with PD or neuronal function was achieved. Eight (FXN, MFN2, MYOC, NPC1, PSEN1, RET, SCN3A and SPG7) were the most significant. Conclusions: The multistep approach developed made it possible to conduct an effective search for potential pathogenetically significant variants, presumably involved in the pathogenesis of PD. The data obtained need to be further verified experimentally.
Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. Patients with NPC1 disease show a series of symptoms in neuropathology, including a gradually increased loss of motor control and seizures. However, mechanism of the neurological manifestations in NPC1 disease is not fully understood yet. In this study, we utilized the micro-electrode array (MEA) to analyze the spontaneous extracellular electrical activity in cultivated cortical neurons of the NPC1 mutant (NPC1-/-) mouse. Our results show a decrease of the spontaneous electrical activity in NPC1-/- neuronal network when compared to wild type neurons, as indicated by the decreased spike rate, burst rate, event rate, and the increased burst period and event period. Application of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a specific agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, improved the electrical activity of the NPC1-/- neuronal network, suggesting that DHPG can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for recovery of the electrical activity in NPC1 disease.
In the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential of in vivo inhibition of miR-486 and miR-92a to reverse hyperlipidemia, then to identify and validate their lipid metabolism-related target genes. Male Golden-Syrian hamsters fed a hyperlipidemic (HL) diet (standard chow plus 3% cholesterol and 15% butter, 10 weeks) were injected subcutaneously with lock-nucleic acid inhibitors for either miR-486 or miR-92a. Lipids and miRNAs levels in liver and plasma, and hepatic expression of miRNAs target genes were assessed in all HL hamsters. MiR-486 and miR-92a target genes were identified by miRWalk analysis and validated by 3'UTR cloning in pmirGLO vectors. HL hamsters had increased liver (2.8-fold) and plasma (twofold) miR-486 levels, and increased miR-92a (2.8-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively) compared to normolipidemic hamsters. After 2 weeks treatment, liver and plasma cholesterol levels decreased (23 and 17.5% for anti-miR-486, 16 and 22% for miR-92a inhibition). Hepatic triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids content decreased also significantly. Bioinformatics analysis and 3'UTR cloning in pmirGLO vector showed that sterol O-acyltransferase-2 (SOAT2) and sterol-regulatory element binding transcription factor-1 (SREBF1) are targeted by miR-486, while ATP-binding cassette G4 (ABCG4) and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) by miR-92a. In HL livers and in cultured HepG2 cells, miR-486 inhibition restored the levels of SOAT2 and SREBF1 expression, while anti-miR-92a restored ABCG4, NPC1 and SOAT2 expression compared to scrambled-treated HL hamsters or cultured cells. In vivo inhibition of miR-486 and miR-92a could be a useful and valuable new approach to correct lipid metabolism dysregulation.
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes fatal hemorrhagic fever with high death rates in human. Currently, there are no available clinically-approved prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. The recently solved crystal structure of cleavage-primed EBOV glycoprotein (GPcl) in complex with the C domain of endosomal protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) provides a new target for the development of EBOV entry inhibitors. In this work, a computational approach using docking and molecular dynamic simulations is carried out for the rational design of peptide inhibitors. A novel cyclo-peptide (Pep-3.3) was identified to target at the late stage of EBOV entry and exhibit specific inhibitory activity against EBOV-GP pseudotyped viruses, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.1 μM. In vitro binding assay and molecular simulations revealed that Pep-3.3 binds to GPcl with a KD value of 69.7 μM, through interacting with predicted residues in the hydrophobic binding pocket of GPcl. Mutation of predicted residues T83 caused resistance to Pep-3.3 inhibition in viral infectivity, providing preliminary support for the model of the peptide binding to GPcl. This study demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting EBOV entry by targeting GPcl with peptides.
