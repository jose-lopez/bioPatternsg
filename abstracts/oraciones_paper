Since UPR activation occurs in <2 min, it is an initial cell response when EGF binds EGFR. PMID: 26551735.
Aberrant activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) contributes to many human cancers by activating the Ras-MAPK pathway and other pathways. PMID: 26551075.
Furthermore, M-Ras brought about ERK pathway-mediated activating phosphorylation of CREB and the CREB-mediated transcription. PMID: 16923128.
In contrast, Tax did not form a similar complex on the CREB binding site in the somatostatin promoter
