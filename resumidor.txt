s="western">GATA proteins are transcription factors that bind GATA DNA elements through Cys4 structural zinc-binding domains and play critical regulatory roles in neurological and urogenital development and the development of cardiac disease. To evaluate GATA proteins as potential targets for lead, spectroscopically monitored metal-binding titrations were used to measure the affinity of Pb2+ for the C-terminal zinc-binding domain from chicken GATA-1 (CF) and the double-finger domain from human GATA-1 (DF). Using this method, Pb2+ coordinating to CF and DF was directly observed through the appearance of intense bands in the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum (250-380 nm). Absorption data collected from these experiments were best fit to a 1:1 Pb2+ -CF model and a 2:1 Pb2+ -DF model. Competition experiments using Zn2+ were used to determine the absolute affinities of Pb2+ for these proteins. These studies reveal that Pb2+ forms tight complexes with cysteine residues in the zinc-binding sites in GATA proteins, beta1Pb = 6.4 (+/- 2.0) x 10(9) M(-1) for CF and beta2 = 6.3 (+/- 6.3) x 10(19) M(-2) for Pb(2+)2-DF, and within an order of magnitude of the affinity of Zn2+ for these proteins. Furthermore, Pb2+ was able to displace bound Zn2+ from CF and DF. Upon addition of Pb2+, GATA shows a decreased ability to bind to DNA and subsequently activate transcription. Therefore, the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of GATA proteins are most likely to be targeted by Pb2+ in cells and tissues that sequester Pb2+ in vivo, which include the brain and the hear.
e GATA proteins regulate processes that are vital to development, and each possesses two tandem GATA finger domains: an N-terminal GATA finger and a C-terminal GATA finger. These GATA fingers require Zn(2+) to fold, to bind DNA recognition elements, and to regulate transcription. While the GATA-1 C-terminal finger is necessary and sufficient to bind to single GATA DNA sites, the N-terminal finger interacts with DNA such that the double finger unit (DF domain) has a binding and transactivation profile that is tuned by the DNA-binding site. Co(2+) was used as a spectroscopic probe in a series of competition titrations to determine the affinity of Co(2+) and Zn(2+) for the C-terminal finger from chicken GATA-1 and the double finger from human GATA-1 (referred to in this report as CF and DF). For CF, these experiments yielded K(b)(Co) = 1.0 (+/-1.3) x 10(7) M(-1) and K(b)(Zn) = 2.0 (+/-1.3) x 10(10) M(-1). For DF, these experiments yielded equilibrium constants for the process of two M(2+) binding to form M(2+)(2)-DF of beta(2)(Co) = 2.5 (+/-1.6) x 10(14) M(-2) and beta(2)(Zn) = 6.3 (+/-2.5) x 10(20) M(-2). The ZnS(4) coordination environment of Zn(2+)-bound CF was confirmed with X-ray absorption spectroscopy. A detailed analysis of these data suggests that the N-terminal and C-terminal fingers of DF act as independent and identical Zn(2+)-binding sites and each finger binds Zn(2+) with an affinity equivalent to that of C.
tion of the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene is under the control of four promoters (P1-P4) that are differentially active during growth and development. Promoter 3 (P3) is the most active promoter during fetal development as well as in most adult tissues. P3 is also the most active promoter in tumour tissues and cell lines expressing IGF-II. Transient transfections of HeLa and Hep3B cells with truncated promoter constructs revealed that the region between -289 and -183 relative to the transcription start site supports basal promoter activity in both cell lines. Footprint experiments showed that the region between positions -192 and -172 (P3-4) is the only element bound by nuclear proteins. P3-4 is bound by five proteins, of which three proteins (proteins 3, 4 and 5) bind specifically and are expressed at the same levels in HeLa and Hep3B cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and differential footprint experiments revealed the presence of two protein-binding regions within the P3-4 element. Proteins 4 and 5 bind box A (-193 to -188), whereas box B (-183 to -172) is bound by protein 3. From transcription experiments in vitro it can be concluded that Box A is essential for P3 activity. Box A is part of a region 11 dG residues long and is protected by proteins 4 and 5 that bind a contiguous set of six dG residues. DNA-binding of proteins 4 and 5 to box A requires the presence of Zn2+ ions. Thus structural and functional analysis reveals that the P3-4 element is a key regulatory element of P3 that contains two separate binding sites for proteins essential for the basal activity of IGF-II P.
igate the mechanism of nitrogen metabolite repression in the biotechnologically important fungus Penicillium chrysogenum a polymerase chain reaction approach was employed to identify transcription factors involved in this regulatory circuit, leading to the isolation of a new gene (nreB) encoding a 298 amino acid protein. Despite a low overall amino acid sequence identity of approximately 30%, it shares several features with Dal80p/Uga43p and Gzf3p/Nil2p, both repressors in nitrogen metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All three proteins contain an N-terminal GATA-type zinc finger motif, displaying 86% amino acid sequence identity, and a putative leucine zipper motif in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of two nreB transcripts, 1.8 and 1.5 kilobases in length, that differ in polyadenylation sites. The steady state level of both transcripts is subject to nitrogen metabolite repression. The putative DNA binding domain of NREB, expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, binds in vitro to GATA sites of its own 5'-upstream region as well as in the promoter of the nitrate assimilation gene cluster. Consistent with a role in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism, overexpression of nreB leads to repression of nitrate assimilatory genes. Hence, the simple view of nitrogen regulation by four GATA factors in yeast, but only one key regulator in filamentous ascomycetes seems no longer vali.
 corresponding to residues 101-141 of the human nucleotide excision repair protein XPA was synthesized with an isoleucine substituted for L138 and its solution structure studied by circular dichroism and homonuclear 1H NMR spectroscopy. The peptide, (XPA-41), contains a C4-type zinc-binding motif, C105-(X)2-C108-(X)17-C126-(X)2-C129, which XPA requires for damaged-DNA binding activity. The proton resonances of XPA-41 without zinc (apoXPA-41) were assigned using homonuclear TOCSY, NOESY and DQF-COSY data and show the apo-zinc peptide is a random coil. The peptide was folded with the addition of 1.2 equivalents of ZnCl2 in dilute solution at pH 4.0. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy illustrated an increase in the molecular weight of XPA-41 by 65 amu. Circular dichroism spectra of the zinc-folded peptide (zXPA-41) showed the acquisition of elements of secondary structure. Such a conclusion was confirmed with 1H NMR data collected at 25 degrees C, pH 6.3. H alpha-secondary shifts and NOE patterns indicate that regions V102-C105 and G109-F112 form an anti-parallel beta-sheet and residues N128-K137 form a nascent alpha-helix. Rapid exchange of most amide resonances between S115-C126 prohibited unambiguous assignment of all the proton resonances in this region. However, a 1.19 ppm downfield shift of the H alpha resonance of T125 relative to the apo-zinc peptide, together with downfield shifted H alpha resonances for the adjacent residues (P124 and L123), suggest a second beta-sheet is present in the S115-C126 region. On the basis of structural similarities to GATA-1 (Science 261:438-446), a homology generated structure for zXPA-41 was made, using GATA-1 as the template, which satisfied all the observed NOEs. Using the hybrid homology-NMR based zXPA-41 structure and analogy to GATA-1, models for the role played by the zinc-binding core (101-141) of XPA in DNA damage recognition are propose.
nitrogen regulatory protein of Neurospora is a DNA binding protein which contains a single Cys2/Cys2 type finger motif followed immediately by a highly basic region. Several different approaches were employed to identify nucleotides which appear to be in contact with NIT2 in the DNA-protein complex. Methylation interference and missing contact analyses with the promoter DNA fragment of the L-amino acid oxidase gene showed that all three purines in both of two GATA core sequences and the single adenine residue in each of the complementary TATC sequences were in intimate contact with NIT2. Modification or loss of the three purine residues located between the two GATA core sequences also significantly reduced NIT2 binding, whereas alteration of purines which flank the binding element showed only minor effects. Chemical modification of all six thymine bases in the two GATA and TATC complement core sequences also strongly affected NIT2 binding. High affinity NIT2 binding sites appear to contain at least two GATA core sequences, with single GATA sequences acting only as weak binding sites. Mobility shift experiments with the DNA fragment upstream of nit-3, the structural gene for nitrate reductase, revealed two DNA-NIT2 protein complexes. In complex I, which is formed first, NIT2 was bound to a pair of GATA sites located at -180. In complex II, the paired GATA sites at -180 plus a single GATA site at -290 were all occupied by NIT2. A DNA fragment containing only the single -290 GATA element bound NIT2 very weakly. The affinity of this single GATA for NIT2 was ten to twenty times greater when it was situated on the same DNA fragment with the distant paired GATA elements than when alon.
inc supplementation may help to promote growth, boost the immune system, protect against diabetes, and aid recovery from diarrhoea. We exploited the zebrafish (Danio rerio) gill as a unique vertebrate ion transporting epithelium model to study the time-dependent regulatory networks of gene-expression leading to homeostatic control during zinc supplementation. This organ forms a conduit for zinc uptake whilst exhibiting conservation of zinc trafficking component.
 maintained with either zinc supplemented water (4.0 μM) and diet (2023 mg zinc kg-1) or water and diet containing Zn2+ at 0.25 μM and 233 mg zinc kg-1, respectively. Gill tissues were harvested at five time points (8 hours to 14 days) and transcriptome changes analysed in quintuplicate using a 16 K microarray with results anchored to gill Zn2+ influx and whole body nutrient composition (protein, carbohydrate, lipid, elements). The number of regulated genes increased up to day 7 but declined as the fish acclimated. In total 525 genes were regulated (having a fold-change more than 1.8 fold change and an adjusted P-value less than 0.1 which is controlling a 10% False discovery rate, FDR) by zinc supplementation, but little overlap was observed between genes regulated at successive time-points. Many genes displayed cyclic expression, typical for homeostatic control mechanisms. Annotation enrichment analysis revealed strong overrepresentation of &quot;transcription factors&quot;, with specific association evident with &quot;steroid hormone receptors&quot;. A suite of genes linked to &quot;development&quot; were also statistically overrepresented. More specifically, early regulation of genes was linked to a few key transcription factors (e.g. Mtf1, Jun, Stat1, Ppara, Gata3) and was followed by hedgehog and bone morphogenic protein signallin.
ts suggest that zinc supplementation reactivated developmental pathways in the gill and stimulated stem cell differentiation, a response likely reflecting gill remodelling in response to its altered environment. This provides insight to the role of zinc during cell differentiation and illustrates the critical nature of maintaining zinc status. The study also highlights the importance of temporal transcriptomics analysis in order resolve the discrete elements of biological processes, such as zinc acclimatio.
xamples of uncommon three-dimensional Ca-bearing metal organic frameworks, [Ca(H2O)3(HPXBP)] (CaP1) and [Ca2(H2O)2(HPXBP)1.5] (CaP2) (PXBP: p-xylylenebisphosphonate), were prepared and their structures characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. CaP1 crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group, with three water molecules occupying a half coordination sphere on one side of the Ca atom, while CaP2 crystallizes in the triclinic P1̅ space group, with two crystallographic unique Ca atoms, each coordinated by a single water molecule. In contrast with CaP2, which exhibits very low bioactivity, CaP1 readily precipitates bone-precursor phases (octacalcium phosphate, OCP, and hydroxyapatite) in SBF solutions. Moreover, studies with MG63 osteoblast-like cells indicate that CaP1 is not toxic and stimulates bone mineralization and, thus, holds considerable potential for treating bone diseases, such as osteoporosi.
 fungal pathogen of humans, Candida albicans, mounts robust responses to oxidative stress that are critical for its virulence. These responses counteract the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated by host immune cells in an attempt to kill the invading fungus. Knowledge of the dynamical processes that instigate C. albicans oxidative stress responses is required for a proper understanding of fungus-host interactions. Therefore, we have adopted an interdisciplinary approach to explore the dynamical responses of C. albicans to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our deterministic mathematical model integrates two major oxidative stress signalling pathways (Cap1 and Hog1 pathways) with the three major antioxidant systems (catalase, glutathione and thioredoxin systems) and the pentose phosphate pathway, which provides reducing equivalents required for oxidative stress adaptation. The model encapsulates existing knowledge of these systems with new genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, molecular and cellular datasets. Our integrative approach predicts the existence of alternative states for the key regulators Cap1 and Hog1, thereby suggesting novel regulatory behaviours during oxidative stress. The model reproduces both existing and new experimental observations under a variety of scenarios. Time- and dose-dependent predictions of the oxidative stress responses for both wild type and mutant cells have highlighted the different temporal contributions of the various antioxidant systems during oxidative stress adaptation, indicating that catalase plays a critical role immediately following stress imposition. This is the first model to encapsulate the dynamics of the transcriptional response alongside the redox kinetics of the major antioxidant systems during H2O2 stress in C. albican.
ine the prevalence of the different capsular polysaccharide (CP) and major surface-associated non-CP antigen 336 (SP-336) types among Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bovine mastitis cases in Australia and Indi.
f 414 strains (154 from Australia, 260 from India) isolated from clinical bovine mastitis were included in the study. Mouse antisera raised against CP types (CP1, CP2, CP5, and CP8) or SP-336 were used in slide agglutination tests and compared with detection of cap1, cap5 and cap8 gene fragments by PC.
al studies revealed the presence of CP2, CP5, CP8 and SP-336 in 9.1%, 23.4%, 31.8%, and 5.8% of the Australian versus 0.8%, 46.9%, 13.1% and 0% of the Indian isolates, respectively. By PCR, CP1, CP5 and CP8 accounted for 0%, 26.6% and 32.4% of the Australian versus 3.9%, 85% and 8.1% of the Indian isolates, respectivel.
and the serological method demonstrated that CP5 and CP8 are the predominant capsular types in Australia, whereas CP5 is the predominant capsular type in India. The study also demonstrated a strong correlation between both methods of typing for CP1, CP5, CP8 and non-typeable S. aureus strains. High-percentage prevalence of non-typeable isolates in both the countries highlights the importance of continued investigations of the identification of unique surface-associated polysaccharide antigens prevalent among S. aureus isolates for the formulation of CP- and SP-based vaccines for bovine mastiti.
e immune sensor RIG-I recognizes viral RNA while avoiding unwanted activation by self RNA. In this issue of Immunity, Schuberth-Wagner et al. (2015) show that a histidine residue in the RNA binding pocket of RIG-I sterically excludes the cap1 structure of self RNA, thereby preventing downstream activatio.
f this study was to investigate the antifungal activity of baicalin and its potential mechanism of action against Candida albicans biofilms. The standard techniques including microdilution method and checkerboard assay were employed to evaluate the susceptibilities of baicalin alone and in combination with fluconazole against planktonic and biofilm cells of C.&nbsp;albicans. Transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), fluorescent microscope and flow cytometry were used to assess the apoptotic incidences induced by baicalin in biofilm cells. The expressions of four genes (RAS1, CAP1, PDE2 and TPK1) related to Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway were also analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and sessile minimum inhibitory concentration (SMIC50) of baicalin were 500 and 2000&nbsp;μg/mL with fractional inhibitory concentration indexs (FICIs) ranging from 0.28 to 0.75. A series of events related to apoptosis were observed in baicalin-treated C.&nbsp;albicans biofilms, including extensive chromatin condensation along the nuclear envelope, ROS accumulation, MMP reduction, PS externalization, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, metacaspase activation and Cyt C release. Additionally, the expressions of RAS1 and TPK1 were up-regulated by 3.2 and 2.9 folds respectively, while those of CAP1 and PDE2 were down-regulated by 3.3 and 6.6 folds respectively after exposure to baicalin in biofilm cells. In conclusion, baicalin can suppress the development of C.&nbsp;albicans biofilms most likely due to inducing cell death via apoptosi.
rning of actin cytoskeleton structures in vivo is a product of spatially and temporally regulated polymer assembly balanced by polymer disassembly. While in recent years our understanding of actin assembly mechanisms has grown immensely, our knowledge of actin disassembly machinery and mechanisms has remained comparatively sparse. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an ideal system to tackle this problem, both because of its amenabilities to genetic manipulation and live-cell imaging and because only a single gene encodes each of the core disassembly factors: cofilin (COF1), Srv2/CAP (SRV2), Aip1 (AIP1), GMF (GMF1/AIM7), coronin (CRN1), and twinfilin (TWF1). Among these six factors, only the functions of cofilin are essential and have been well defined. Here, we investigated the functions of the nonessential actin disassembly factors by performing genetic and live-cell imaging analyses on a combinatorial set of isogenic single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants in S. cerevisiae. Our results show that each disassembly factor makes an important contribution to cell viability, actin organization, and endocytosis. Further, our data reveal new relationships among these factors, providing insights into how they work together to orchestrate actin turnover. Finally, we observe specific combinations of mutations that are lethal, e.g., srv2Δ aip1Δ and srv2Δ crn1Δ twf1Δ, demonstrating that while cofilin is essential, it is not sufficient in vivo, and that combinations of the other disassembly factors perform vital functions. © 2015 The Authors.

e protease prostasin (PRSS8, CAP1) and its activator matriptase and inhibitor nexin-1 are necessary for normal placental development in mice. Prostasin is regulated by aldosterone in the kidney and may activate the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Preeclampsia is characterized by disturbed placentation, suppression of aldosterone and avid renal sodium retention with hypertension. It was hypothesized that preeclampsia is associated with low prostasin expression in placenta and spillover of prostasin into urine across the defect glomeular barrie.
hesis was addressed in a cross-sectional case-control design with 20 healthy pregnant women and 20 women with new onset of preeclampsia (hypertension and 1+ for protein on urine dipstick). Blood and urine samples were obtained in relation to delivery and placental biopsies were taken immediately after delivery (control = 39 and preeclampsia 40 weeks). Prostasin, matriptase, nexin-1 and HAIs were measured by qPCR and western immunoblotting (prostasin, matriptase, nexin-1) and ELISA (prostasin). Aldosterone was measured in plasma and urine by ELIS.
h preeclampsia displayed lower levels of aldosterone in plasma and in spot urine normalized for creatinine (p = 0.0001). Placental weight was not different between groups. Prostasin, matriptase, HAI 1 and 2, and nexin mRNA abundances were not different in placental tissue between groups. Prostasin and nexin protein level in placental homogenate was not different between groups. Active matriptase was expressed at very low levels in placenta. Western blotting showed significantly elevated urine excretion of prostasin in preeclamptic patients compared to controls. Plasma prostasin was not different between groups and did not correlate to aldosterone or placental weight. In summary, preeclampsia is associated with increased urine but not plasma or tissue prostas.
oncluded that placental and plasma prostasin level is not controlled by aldosterone during term pregnancy. In contrast, prostasin is aberrantly filtered and may contribute to renal EnaC activation and suppression of aldosterone in preeclampsia. Potential impact of prostasin-matriptase on placental development is likely to be at the level of activity and not protein abundanc.
protein components of hookworm species include a number of representatives of the cysteine-rich/antigen 5/pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) protein family known as Ancylostoma-secreted proteins (ASPs). Some of these have been considered as candidate antigens for the development of vaccines against hookworms. The functions of most CAP superfamily members are poorly understood, but one form, the hookworm platelet inhibitor (HPI), has been isolated as a putative antagonist of the platelet integrins αIIbβ3 and α2β1. Here, the crystal structure of HPI is described and its structural features are examined in relation to its possible function. The HPI structure is similar to those of other ASPs and shows incomplete conservation of the sequence motifs CAP1 and CAP2 that are considered to be diagnostic of CAP superfamily members. The asymmetric unit of the HPI crystal contains a dimer with an extensive interaction interface, but chromatographic measurements indicate that it is primarily monomeric in solution. In the dimeric structure, the putative active-site cleft areas from both monomers are united into a single negatively charged depression. A potential Lys-Gly-Asp disintegrin-like motif was identified in the sequence of HPI, but is not positioned at the apex of a tight turn, making it unlikely that it interacts with the integrin. Recombinant HPI produced in Escherichia coli was found not to inhibit the adhesion of human platelets to collagen or fibrinogen, despite having a native structure as shown by X-ray diffraction. This result corroborates previous analyses of recombinant HPI and suggests that it might require post-translational modification or have a different biological functio.
e virus (BTV) encodes a single capping protein, VP4, which catalyzes all reactions required to generate cap1 structures on nascent viral transcripts. Further, structural analysis by X-ray crystallography indicated each catalytic reaction is arranged as a discrete domain, including a nucleoside-2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O MTase). In this study, we have exploited the structural information to identify the residues that are important for the catalytic activity of 2'-O MTase of VP4 and their influence on BTV replication. The effect of these mutations on GMP binding, guanylyltransferase (GTase) and methylase activities were analysed by a series of in vitro biochemical assays using recombinant mutant proteins; subsequently their effects on virus replication were assessed by introducing the same mutations in replicating viral genome using a reverse genetics system. Our data showed that single substitution mutations in the catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E were sufficient to abolish 2'-O MTase activity in vitro and to completely abrogate BTV replication in cells; although these mutants retained the upstream GMP binding, GTase and guanine-N7-methyltransferase activities. Mutations of the surrounding substrate-binding pocket (predicted to recruit cap0) had variable effects on in vitro VP4 capping activity. Only triple but not single substitution mutations of these residues in genome resulted in reduced virus replication kinetics. This is the first report investigating the importance of 2'-O MTase function for any member of the Reoviridae and highlights the significance of K-D-K-E tetrad and surrounding residues for the efficiency of 2'-O MTase activity and in turn, for virus fitnes.
yt-associated protein kinase (CAP) gene 1 is a receptor-like kinase that belongs to CrRLK1L (Catharanthus roseus Receptor like kinase) subfamily. CAP1 has been identified as a novel modulator of NH4(+) in the tonoplast, which regulates root hair growth by maintaining the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) gradients. Different expression pattern of tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP2;3) in the CAP1 knock out mutant and wild type on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium suggested that CAP1 influences transport activity to regulate the compartmentalization of NH4(+) into vacuole. Lower expression level of Oxidative Signal-Inducible1(OXI1) in the cap1-1 root and the abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS) gradient in root hair of cap1-1 on MS medium indicated that ROS signaling involve in CAP1-regulated root hair growth. Wild-type-like ROS distribution pattern in the cap1-1 root hair can be reestablished in seedlings grown on NH4(+) deficient medium, which indicated that CAP1 functions as a sensor for NH4(+) signaling in maintaining tip-focused ROS gradient in root hairs polar growt.
 cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) regulates both actin filaments and the Ras/cAMP pathway in yeast, and has been found play a role in cell motility and in the development of certain types of cancer. In the present study, we investigated CAP1 gene expression in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed using EOC tissue samples and the results revealed that CAP1 expression increased with the increasing grade of EOC. In the normal ovarian tissue samples however, CAP1 expression was barely detected. Using Pearson's χ2 test, it was demonstrated that CAP1 expression was associated with the histological grade and Ki-67 expression. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a higher CAP1 expression in patients with EOC was associated with a poorer prognosis. In in vitro experiments using HO-8910 EOC cells, the expression of CAP1 was knocked down using siRNA. The proliferation of the HO-8910 cells was then determined by cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation assay using the cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry. The results revealed that the loss of CAP1 expression inhibited cell cycle progression. These findings suggest that a high expression of CAP1 is involved in the pathogenesis of EOC, and that the downregulation of CAP1 in tumor cells may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with EO.
beam irradiation has shown potential as an alternative process for the treatment of industrial effluents that contain toxic organic chemicals. This study investigated the effectiveness of electron beam in degrading chloramphenicol (CAP) in aqueous solution. The degradation efficiency was 32.4% at 1 kGy, 86.9% at 5 kGy, and 100% at 10 kGy. The total organic carbon (TOC) of CAP in aqueous solution declined 4.6% at 1 kGy, 12.1% at 5 kGy, and 17.1% at 10 kGy of irradiation with electron beam. The CAP degradation products after irradiation were CAP1 ([M + H] m/z 307.1), CAP2 ([M + H] m/z 291.1), and CAP3 ([M + H] m/z 321.1). The degradation products were tested for microbial toxicity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Bacillus subtilis and did not show any toxic antimicrobial effects caused by the CAP degradation products after irradiation with electron beam. The results of this study suggest that electron beam irradiation is the best technology for the comprehensive treatment of veterinary antibiotics at wastewater treatment plant.
ssociated protein (CAP) is a highly conserved protein with roles in actin dynamics and many cellular processes. Two isoforms exist in higher eukaryotes, CAP1 and CAP2. CAP1 is ubiquitously expressed whereas CAP2 shows restricted tissue distribution. In mice, ablation of CAP2 leads to development of cardiomyopathy. CAP2 is expressed in skin. In human skin its expression is increased in wounds. To elucidate the role of CAP2 in skin upon injury, we studied the wound healing in CAP2 deficient mice and found altered wound healing response presumably resulting from reduced levels of α-SMA, decreased macrophage infiltration and slower neovascularization. In vitro cultured Cap2 deficient keratinocytes showed reduced velocity and a delay in scratch closure. The analysis of primary mutant fibroblasts also showed reduced velocity and less contractibility. They had extended protrusions and more focal adhesions. In addition the F-actin content was increased keeping the total actin content unaltered. Mutant fibroblasts furthermore exhibited an altered response during recovery from drug-induced disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, CAP1 was upregulated in knockout unwounded skin and in wounds which might partially compensate for the loss of CAP2. Taken together, our studies reveal a role for CAP2 in wound healing which may be based on its function as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleto.
y was designed to establish a biomarker risk model for predicting brain metastasis (BM) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The model comprises 120 cases of NSCLC that were treated and followed up for 4 years. The patients were divided into the BM (n=50) and non-BM (other visceral metastasis and those without recurrence) (n=70) groups. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses were performed in metastatic tissues of NSCLC. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to correlate the immunoreactive cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) signal with BM. Survival analyses were performed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. CAP1 protein content and immunoreactivity were significantly increased in BM specimens compared to other-metastatic specimens. The survival analysis revealed that CAP1 overexpression was significantly associated with survival (P&lt;0.05). The ROC test suggested that the area under the curve was 73.33% (P&lt;0.001; 95% CI, 63.5-83.2%). When P=0.466, the sensitivity and specificity reached 79.5 and 67.1%, respectively. These findings suggested that CAP1 is involved in the BM of NSCLC, and that elevated levels of CAP1 expression may indicate a poor prognosis for patients with BM. The CAP1 molecular model may be useful in the prediction of the risk of BM in NSCL.
igate the relationship between expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and expression of adenylyl cyclase-associated protein (CAP)-1 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD.
with possible respiratory disease were recruited into the study and divided into a COPD group and a non-COPD group on diagnosis. Pulmonary function tests were performed and serum concentrations of MMP-9 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MMP-9 and CAP1 expression were analysed in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in all available samples using immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. In addition, expression of MMP-9 and CAP1 in vitro was investigated using immunofluorescence. Expression of CAP1 in response to MMP-9 was measured in the human alveolar epithelial cell line HP-AEpiC, using Western blo.
f 90 patients were included in the study: 52 were in the COPD group and 38 in the non-COPD group. Serum MMP-9 concentrations were significantly higher in the COPD than in the non-COPD group. MMP-9 serum concentrations were negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 as a percentage of the normal predicted value and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity, and were positively correlated with residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC) and RV/TLC values. In lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, MMP-9 and CAP1 expression were inversely related. This relationship was confirmed in HP-AEpiC cells. High expression of MMP-9 and low expression of CAP1 was demonstrated in the COPD group compared with the non-COPD grou.
y demonstrated an inverse relationship between CAP1 and MMP-9 expression, and high expression of MMP-9 and low expression of CAP1 in those with COPD compared with the non-COPD group. Overexpression of MMP-9 in lung tissue and its interaction with CAP1 is likely to play a major role in airway obstruction in COP.
aling can control the dynamic balance between filamentous and monomeric actin by modulating actin regulatory proteins. One family of actin regulating proteins that controls actin dynamics comprises cyclase-associated proteins 1 and 2 (CAP1 and 2, respectively). However, cell signals that regulate CAPs remained unknown. We mapped phosphorylation sites on mouse CAP1 and found S307 and S309 to be regulatory sites. We further identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 as a kinase phosphorylating S309. The phosphomimetic mutant S307D/S309D lost binding to its partner cofilin and, when expressed in cells, caused accumulation of actin stress fibers similar to that in cells with reduced CAP expression. In contrast, the non-phosphorylatable S307A/S309A mutant showed drastically increased cofilin binding and reduced binding to actin. These results suggest that the phosphorylation serves to facilitate release of cofilin for a subsequent cycle of actin filament severing. Moreover, our results suggest that S307 and S309 function in tandem; neither the alterations in binding cofilin and/or actin, nor the defects in rescuing the phenotype of the enlarged cell size in CAP1 knockdown cells was observed in point mutants of either S307 or S309. In summary, we identify a novel regulatory mechanism of CAP1 through phosphorylatio.
lbicans is one of the most important opportunistic pathogens, causing both mucosal candidiasis and life-threatening systemic infections. To survive in the host immune defense system, this pathogen uses an elaborate signaling network to recognize and respond to oxidative stress, which is essential for its pathogenicity. However, the exact mechanisms that this fungus employs to integrate the oxidative stress response (OSR) with functions of various organelles remain uncharacterized. Our previous work implicated a connection between the calcium signaling system and the OSR. In this study, we find that the vacuolar transient receptor potential (TRP) channel Yvc1, one of the calcium signaling members, plays a critical role in cell tolerance to oxidative stress. We further provide evidence that this channel is required not only for activation of Cap1-related transcription of OSR genes but also for maintaining the stability of both the mitochondria and the vacuole in a potassium- and calcium-dependent manner. Element assays reveal that this TRP channel affects calcium influx and potassium transport from the vacuole to the mitochondria. Therefore, the TRP channel governs the novel interaction among the OSR, the vacuole, and the mitochondria by mediating ion transport in this pathogen under oxidative stres.
arapsilosis and Candida albicans are human fungal pathogens that belong to the CTG clade in the Saccharomycotina. In contrast to C. albicans, relatively little is known about the virulence properties of C. parapsilosis, a pathogen particularly associated with infections of premature neonates. We describe here the construction of C. parapsilosis strains carrying double allele deletions of 100 transcription factors, protein kinases and species-specific genes. Two independent deletions were constructed for each target gene. Growth in &gt;40 conditions was tested, including carbon source, temperature, and the presence of antifungal drugs. The phenotypes were compared to C. albicans strains with deletions of orthologous transcription factors. We found that many phenotypes are shared between the two species, such as the role of Upc2 as a regulator of azole resistance, and of CAP1 in the oxidative stress response. Others are unique to one species. For example, Cph2 plays a role in the hypoxic response in C. parapsilosis but not in C. albicans. We found extensive divergence between the biofilm regulators of the two species. We identified seven transcription factors and one protein kinase that are required for biofilm development in C. parapsilosis. Only three (Efg1, Bcr1 and Ace2) have similar effects on C. albicans biofilms, whereas Cph2, Czf1, Gzf3 and Ume6 have major roles in C. parapsilosis only. Two transcription factors (Brg1 and Tec1) with well-characterized roles in biofilm formation in C. albicans do not have the same function in C. parapsilosis. We also compared the transcription profile of C. parapsilosis and C. albicans biofilms. Our analysis suggests the processes shared between the two species are predominantly metabolic, and that Cph2 and Bcr1 are major biofilm regulators in C. parapsilosi.
is a conserved actin-binding protein with important roles in driving cellular actin dynamics in diverse animal, fungal, and plant species. However, there have been conflicting reports about whether the activities of Srv2/CAP are conserved, particularly between yeast and mammalian homologs. Yeast Srv2 has two distinct functions in actin turnover: its hexameric N-terminal-half enhances cofilin-mediated severing of filaments, while its C-terminal-half catalyzes dissociation of cofilin from ADP-actin monomers and stimulates nucleotide exchange. Here, we dissected the structure and function of mouse CAP1 to better understand its mechanistic relationship to yeast Srv2. Although CAP1 has a shorter N-terminal oligomerization sequence compared with Srv2, we find that the N-terminal-half of CAP1 (N-CAP1) forms hexameric structures with six protrusions, similar to N-Srv2. Further, N-CAP1 autonomously binds to F-actin and decorates the sides and ends of filaments, altering F-actin structure and enhancing cofilin-mediated severing. These activities depend on conserved surface residues on the helical-folded domain. Moreover, N-CAP1 enhances yeast cofilin-mediated severing, and conversely, yeast N-Srv2 enhances human cofilin-mediated severing, highlighting the mechanistic conservation between yeast and mammals. Further, we demonstrate that the C-terminal actin-binding β-sheet domain of CAP1 is sufficient to catalyze nucleotide-exchange of ADP-actin monomers, while in the presence of cofilin this activity additionally requires the WH2 domain. Thus, the structures, activities, and mechanisms of mouse and yeast Srv2/CAP homologs are remarkably well conserved, suggesting that the same activities and mechanisms underlie many of the diverse actin-based functions ascribed to Srv2/CAP homologs in different organism.
lar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multiprotein complex consisting of the V0 and V1 sectors, and is required for vacuolar acidification and virulence in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. In this study, we identified C. albicans Tfp1 as a putative subunit of V-ATPase, and explored its importance in multiple cellular processes. Our results revealed that Tfp1 played an essential role in vacuolar acidification and endocytic trafficking. In addition, the tfp1Δ/Δ mutant was sensitive to alkaline pH and elevated calcium concentrations, which is characteristic of loss of V-ATPase activity. The mutant also showed hypersensitivity to metal ions which might be attributed to a defect in sequestration of toxic ions to the vacuole through proton gradient produced by V-ATPase. Interestingly, deletion of TFP1 triggered endogenous oxidative stress even without exogenous oxidants. Compared with the wild-type strain, the tfp1Δ/Δ mutant showed significantly higher ROS levels and lower expression levels of redox-related genes with the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Western blotting analysis showed that deletion of TFP1 significantly reduced the expression of Cap1 under H2O2 treatment, which contributes to the regulation of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. Furthermore, the tfp1Δ/Δ mutant showed significantly impaired filamentous development in hyphal induction media, and was avirulent in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. Taken together, our results suggested that the putative V1 subunit Tfp1 is essential for vacuolar function and C. albicans pathogenesis, and provided a promising candidate for antifungal drug.
p of human messenger RNA consists of an inverted 7-methylguanosine linked to the first transcribed nucleotide by a unique 5'-5' triphosphate bond followed by 2'-O-ribose methylation of the first and often the second transcribed nucleotides, likely serving to modify efficiency of transcript processing, translation and stability. We report the validation of a human enzyme that methylates the ribose of the second transcribed nucleotide encoded by FTSJD1, henceforth renamed HMTR2 to reflect function. Purified recombinant hMTr2 protein transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the 2'-O-ribose of the second nucleotide of messenger RNA and small nuclear RNA. Neither N(7) methylation of the guanosine cap nor 2'-O-ribose methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide are required for hMTr2, but the presence of cap1 methylation increases hMTr2 activity. The hMTr2 protein is distributed throughout the nucleus and cytosol, in contrast to the nuclear hMTr1. The details of how and why specific transcripts undergo modification with these ribose methylations remains to be elucidated. The 2'-O-ribose RNA cap methyltransferases are present in varying combinations in most eukaryotic and many viral genomes. With the capping enzymes in hand their biological purpose can be ascertaine.
dases (POs) play key roles in various physiological functions in insects, e.g., cuticular sclerotization, wound healing, egg tanning, cuticle formation and melanotic encapsulaction of pathogens. Previously, we identified five POs, designated As-pro-PO I-V, from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus and demonstrated that the functions of As-pro-PO I, II and III, were associated with filarial parasite melanization, blood feeding and cuticle formation, respectively. In the present study, we delineate the dual functions of As-pro-PO V. We found that the level of As-pro-PO V mRNA in mosquitoes was significantly increased after microfilaria challenge or blood feeding, and decreased to normal level after oviposition. Knockdown of As-pro-PO V by dsRNA resulted in significant decreases in the degree of microfilaria melanization, egg chronic melanization rates and egg hatching rates in Ar. subalbatus. Further transfection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays verified the As-pro-PO V gene might regulated by both AP-1, a putative immune-related regulatory element and CdxA, a developmental regulatory element. The binding of AP-1 and CdxA motif with mosquito nuclear extracts was significantly enhanced after microfilaria challenge and blood-feeding in Ar. subalbatus, respectively. These results indicate that As-pro-PO V is a critical enzyme that is required for both an effective melanization immune response and egg chorion melanization in this mosquit.
t genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0007, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0001, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.74; rs2738081, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0003, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.72; rs2738058, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0001, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.73; rs4288398, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0008, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.78; rs6984215, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.63; rs12716641, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.00002, OR&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chines.
y examined the associations between vitamin D status, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and markers of calcium homeostasis in preschool-aged children. Children (n=488; age range: 1.8-6.0 y) were randomly recruited from Montreal. The distal forearm was scanned using a peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (Lunar PIXI; GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). A subset (n=81) had clinical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) scans (Hologic 4500A Discovery Series) of lumbar spine (LS) 1-4, whole body, and ultradistal forearm. All were assessed for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone concentrations (Liaison; Diasorin), ionized calcium (ABL80 FLEX; Radiometer Medical A/S), and dietary vitamin D and calcium intakes by survey. Age (p&lt;0.001) and weight-for-age Z-score (p&lt;0.001) were positively associated with BMC and aBMD in all regression models, whereas male sex contributed positively to forearm BMC and aBMD. Having a 25(OH)D concentration of &gt;75 nmol/L positively associated with forearm and whole body BMC and aBMD (p&lt;0.036). Sun index related to (p&lt;0.029) cDXA forearm and LS 1-4 BMC and whole-body aBMD. Nutrient intakes did not relate to BMC or aBMD. In conclusion, higher vitamin D status is linked to higher BMC and aBMD of forearm and whole body in preschool-aged childre.
ter pylori encoded CagA is presently the only known virulence factor that is injected into gastric epithelial cells where it destroys apical junctional complexes and induces dedifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells, leading to H. pylori-related gastric carcinogensis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which CagA mediates these changes. Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor highly expressed in multistage tissues of dysplasia and cancer. One specific target of Cdx2, Claudin-2, is involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In this study, our findings showed that the activity of Cdx2 binding to Cdx binding sites of CdxA (GTTTATG) and CdxB (TTTTAGG) of probes corresponding to claudin-2 flanking region increased in AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain. Moreover, Cdx2 upregulated claudin-2 expression at transcriptional level and translational level. In the meantime, we found that TJs of AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain, were more severely destroyed, leading to wider cell gap, interference of contact, scattering and highly elevated migration of cells. Herein, this study is firstly demonstrated that H. pylori-encoded CagA disrupts TJs and induces invasiveness of AGS gastric carcinoma cells via Cdx2-dependent targeting of Claudin-2. This provides a new mechanism whereby CagA induced dedifferentiation of AGS cells, leading to malignant behavior of biolog.
 few large-scale studies on the utility of peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) in children. As central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) equipment is not commonly available in the developing world, we assessed the correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) with cDXA and pDXA in children to determine the optimal Z-score thresholds of pDXA for predicting two predefined Z-score cutoffs (≤-1, ≤-2) of cDXA in 844 subjects (441 boys, 403 girls) aged 10-18 years. The BMD of antero-posterior lumbar spine (L1-L4), proximal femur and forearm was measured by cDXA, while the peripheral BMD of forearm and calcaneus was estimated using pDXA. The correlation was statistically significant at all sites (p&lt;0.01). The coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.79 in boys and 0.17 to 0.32 in girls. A significant positive correlation was observed between BMD by pDXA and cDXA in Indian children, with a strong gender difference in both the extent of correlation and the ability of peripheral BMD to predict central BM.
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine-like molecule that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reactions and Western blot assays indicated that HMGB1 transcriptional activity and protein level are increased in Tax+-T cells (TaxP). To clarify the mechanisms, a series of HMGB1 deletion reporter plasmids (pHLuc1 to pHLuc6) were transfected into Tax--T cells (TaxN, Jurkat) and Tax+-T cells (TaxP). We found that promoter activity in Tax+-T cells to be higher than that in Tax--T cells, indicating a significant increase in pHLuc6. Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) treatment did not block the enhancing effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Tax was retained on a HMGB1 promoter fragment encompassing -1163 to -975. Bioinformatics analysis showed six characteristic cis-elements for CdxA, AP-1, AML-1a, USF, v-Myb, and C/EBP in the fragment in question. Mutation of cis- elements for C/EBP reduced significant HMGB1 promoter activity induced by Tax. These findings indicate that Tax enhances the expression of HMGB1 gene at the transcriptional level, possibly by interacting with C/EB.
n regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a multi-functional transcription factor in the IRF family exhibiting both transcriptional activating and repressing activities. In this study, an IRF-2 gene (HcIRF-2) from Hyriopsis cumingii was identified and characterized. The cDNA sequence consisted of 2688&nbsp;bp, encoding a 329 amino acid-protein. The amino acid sequence had a highly conserved N-terminal DBD structure, containing characteristic repeats of six tryptophan residues. The 5'-flanking region contained several transcription regulation elements such as AP1, CdxA, HSF, NIT2 and HNF-3b. Nine SNPs were obtained through direct sequencing of HcIRF-2 from resistant and susceptible stock. Only&nbsp;+2365T/C SNP was significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility of H.&nbsp;cumingii to Aeromonas hydrophila both in genotype (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.021) and allele (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.006) analysis. The SNPs&nbsp;+2248T/C and&nbsp;+2365T/C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TT frequency in the resistant group was significantly higher than in the susceptible group. The mortality in&nbsp;+2248CC genotype individuals was significantly higher than in CT and TT genotype individuals. These results indicated that haplotype TT and genotype&nbsp;+2248CT and&nbsp;+2248GT individuals were resistant to A.&nbsp;hydrophila, which could make them potential markers in selective breeding of H.&nbsp;cumingi.
the cDNA sequence of GPX in Hyriopsis cumingii, the complete genomic DNA of GPX gene and it's 5'-flanking region were identified from H. cumingii using PCR and genome walking technique. The length of the complete genomic sequence was 6 708 bp including the 5'-flanking region, two exons, and one intron. Sequence analysis of the 992 bp 5'-flanking region revealed that it contained a core promoter element (TATA-box) and other transcription regulation elements such as AP1, C/EBP, and CdxA. The sequence lengths of the two exons were 273 bp and 991 bp, respectively, and the intron was 4 491 bp in length. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the GPX gene from resistant stock (RS) and susceptible stock (SS) of H. cumingii. These polymorphisms were analyzed with regard to resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila. Among them, three SNPs including A-99G, A-86C, and A-49C in GPX promoter and five SNPs including A2841T, C2847T, G3146C, A3150G, and G4645T in GPX introns were associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to A. hydrophila, both in genotype and allele frequency. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that A-86C, A-49C, C2847T, A3150G, G4645T, A2841T, and G3146C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (ACTGT and TG) in the resistant group was significantly higher than that in the susceptible group. The results suggest that the polymorphic loci in the GPX gene could be potential genetic markers for future molecular selection of strains resistant to disease.
ting intestinal physiology in vitro remains challenging due to the lack of an effective primary enterocyte culture system. Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroid.
ction of therapeutic proteins from transgenic animals is one of the most important successes of animal biotechnology. Milk is presently the most mature system for production of therapeutic proteins from a transgenic animal. Specifically, β-casein is a major component of cow, goat and sheep milk, and its promoter has been used to regulate the expression of transgenic genes in the mammary gland of transgenic animals. Here, we cloned the porcine β-casein gene and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the promoter and intron 1 region of the porcine β-casein gene. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including SRY, CdxA, AML-a, GATA-3, GATA-1 and C/EBP β. In addition, the first intron of the porcine β-casein gene contained the transcriptional enhancers Oct-1, SRY, YY1, C/EBP β, and AP-1, as well as the retroviral TATA box. We estimated the transcriptional activity for the 5'-proximal region with or without intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene in HC11 cells stimulated with lactogenic hormones. High transcriptional activity was obtained for the 5'-proximal region with intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene. The β-casein gene containing the mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) was also cloned from another individual pig. Promoter activity of the luciferase vector containing the mutant TATA box was weaker than the same vector containing the normal TATA box. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transcription of porcine β-casein gene is regulated by lactogenic hormone via intron 1 and promoter containing a mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) has poor porcine β-casein gene activit.

 center affiliated with a university. Subjects&nbsp; Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located between RAB7L1 and SLC41A1 were analyzed in 720 patients with PD and 642 controls, all of Ashkenazi Jewish origi.
s were defined and risk estimates were determined for each SNP and haplotype. Bioinformatic analysis defined the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and the transcription factor binding sites that are potentially affected by 2 of the tested SNP.
d SNPs were significantly associated with PD (odds ratios&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.64-0.76; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.0002-.014). Two of them, rs1572931 and rs823144, were localized to the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and their sequence variations altered the predicted transcription factor binding sites of CdxA, p300, GATA-1, Sp1, and c-Ets-1. Only 0.4% of patients were homozygous for the protective rs1572931 genotype (T/T), compared with 3.0% among controls (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10(-5)). This SNP was included in a haplotype that reduced the risk for PD by 10- to 12-fold (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.002-.01) in all patients with PD and in a subgroup of patients who do not carry the Ashkenazi founder mutations in the GBA or LRRK2 gene.
demonstrate that specific SNP variations and haplotypes in the PARK16 locus are associated with reduced risk for PD in Ashkenazim. Although it is possible that alterations in the putative promoter of RAB7L1 are associated with this effect, the role of other genes in this locus cannot be ruled ou.
pendent kinase 6 (CDK6) is a key element of D-type cyclin holoenzymes. It is involved in the regulation of the G1-phase of the cell cycle and is considered to be an important candidate gene for selection of body measurement traits through marker-assisted selection. We cloned the promoter sequence of this gene in bovines and found it to share high similarity with that of the human CDK6 promoter. A 2271-bp sequence upstream of the start codon in the bovine CDK6 5'-flanking sequence is rich in GC; it lacks consensus TATA or CAAT box, but it contains several MZF1 binding sites. Other potential cis-regulatory elements were found in the 5'-flanking region, including CdxA, SRY, p300, GATA-1, and deltaE. Allele frequencies were also analyzed in various cattle breeds (Qinchuan, Qinchuan improvement steers, Nanyang, Jiaxian red, Xia'nan, Luxi, Simmental and Luxi crossbred steers, and Xuelong) and association with a selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was calculated. The T-1075C SNP in the promoter was found to be significantly associated with body length and heart girth. This SNP marker was found to be significantly associated with body length and the heart girth in 737 individuals. We conclude that this SNP of the CDK6 gene has potential as a genetic marker for important body traits in bovine reproduction and breedin.
gy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method to assess bone mineral density (BMD). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends the measurement of BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, but in certain circumstances the 33% radius may be the recommended area to measure BMD. The aim of this study has been to analyze whether 33% radius should be considered the recommended area to assess BMD in prostate cancer patient.
 retrospective study where BMD was assessed by DXA at 33% radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck (cDXA) in 141 prostate cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients were hormone naïve while 113 were subjected to androgen suppression (AS) during the mean period of 29 months. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when T-score was lower than -2.5 and osteopenia when it ranged between -1 and -2..
porosis rate was 29.8% at 33% radius, 23.4% at femoral neck, 19.9% at lumbar spine, and 12.8% at total hip. The overall osteoporosis rate at cDXA was 29.1%. Osteoporosis was detected in 52.2% at 33% radius and 36.2% at cDXA. Normal BMD was found in 17.7% at 33% radius and 34.8% at cDXA. The 33% radius was the only site where a significant increase in the osteoporosis rate was detected in patients subjected to AS compared to those hormone naïve (33 and 13.8%.

phosphatases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in many important biological processes. Mammalian tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase has long been thought to feature in embryonic development and bone formation. In this study, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene from Paralichthys olivaceus was identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and genome-walking PCR. The ALP gene extends 10,141&nbsp;bp and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The open reading frame of the ALP transcript consists of 1,431&nbsp;bp, which encodes 476 amino acids products named as POALP. An analysis of its secondary and tertiary structure revealed that the POALP was conserved in different species, but one disulfide linkage made it possible to adapt to low-temperature environment. The ALP activity was found to be first detectable in the embryo before hatching. The POALP was distributed ubiquitously in the body of P. olivaceus and was particularly high in the digestive tract. These findings suggest the potential role of POALP in nutrient absorption and transportation. During the pre-metamorphosis (F stage), ALP gene expression is 2.5-folds of that in the pro-metamorphosis (E stage); but in the post-metamorphosis (I stage), it was 1.8-folds of that of pro-metamorphosis. Exogenetic thyroxine (T4) and thiourea (TU) influenced the ALP gene expression significantly during the metamorphosis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that Japanese flounder ALP promoter region contained promoter sequence and putative recognition site for several transcriptional factors, including SREBP-1, SYR, and CdxA. In vitro promoter assays employing EGFP reporter system demonstrated that the promoter of ALP was activ.
a bryantii B(1)4 is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and contributes to the degradation of hemicellulose in the rumen. The genome of P. bryantii harbors four genes predicted to encode glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 (GH3) enzymes. To evaluate whether these genes encode enzymes with redundant biological functions, each gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that the enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities. One gene encoded a cellodextrinase (CdxA), and three genes encoded beta-xylosidase enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B, and Xyl3C) with different specificities for either para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates or substituted xylooligosaccharides. To identify the amino acid residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity within this family of enzymes, the roles of conserved residues (R177, K214, H215, M251, and D286) in Xyl3B were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation led to a severely decreased catalytic efficiency without a change in the overall structure of the mutant enzymes. Through amino acid sequence alignments, an amino acid residue (E115) that, when mutated to aspartic acid, resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX) with a concurrent 1.1-fold increase in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was identified. Amino acid residue E115 may therefore contribute to the discrimination between beta-xylosides and beta-glucosides. Our results demonstrate that each of the four GH3 enzymes has evolved to perform a specific role in lignopolysaccharide hydrolysis and provide insight into the role of active-site residues in catalysis and substrate specificity for GH3 enzyme.
 ten bradykinin-related peptides and their cDNAs have been identified from amphibians, but their genes are unknown. In present study, four cDNAs encoding one, two, four and six copies of bradykinin-related peptides were cloned from the frog (Odorrana grahami) skin cDNA library, respectively. Three bradykinin-related peptides (bradykinin, Thr6-bradykinin, Leu5Thr6-bradykinin) were deduced from these four cDNA sequences. Based on the cDNA sequence, the gene sequence encoding an amphibian bradykinin-related peptide from O. grahami was determined. It is composed of 7481 base pairs including two exons and two introns. The first exon codes signal peptide and the second exon codes acidic spacer peptide and Thr6-bradykinin. The promoter region of the bradykinin gene contains several putative recognition sites for nuclear factors, such as SRY, GATA-1, LYF-1, DeltaE, CDXA, NKX-2.5, MIF1 and S8. The current work may facilitate to understand the regulation and possible functions of amphibian skin bradykinin-related peptide.
n regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes, has been implicated in virus and double-stranded RNA mediated induction of IFN-α, IFN-β and RANTES, in virus-induced apoptosis and in tumor suppression. Promoter plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, but the characterization of the human IRF-3 promoter has not been systematically analyzed in HEK 293 cells. To characterize the human IRF-3 promoter, we have isolated a genomic clone of the human IRF-3 gene promoter region containing 1,000 nucleotides of the 5'- flanking region. Transient transfection of 5'-deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region -149/-93 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for full promoter activity. This region contains HSF, E2F, CdxA and c-Myb transcription factor binding sites. The E2F sites are highly conserved among IRF-3 promoter regions of mouse, rat and human. Therefore, it was suggested that this E2F site may be essential for basal promoter activity. Surprisingly, mutation of this E2F site increased the promoter activity by 2-fold. Furthermore, overexpression of E2F1 reduced the transcription activity by 80%. These results indicated that human IRF-3 gene core promoter was located within the region -149/-93 relative to the TSS. E2F1 transcription factor negatively regulates human IRF-3 gene promote.
organ primordia become specified between gastrulation and gut tube folding in Amniotes. Although the requirement for RA signaling for the development of a few individual endoderm organs has been established a systematic assessment of its activity along the entire antero-posterior axis has not been performed in this germ laye.
thesized from gastrulation to somitogenesis in the mesoderm that is close to the developing gut tube. In the branchial arch region specific levels of RA signaling control organ boundaries. The most anterior endoderm forming the thyroid gland is specified in the absence of RA signaling. Increasing RA in anterior branchial arches results in thyroid primordium repression and the induction of more posterior markers such as branchial arch Hox genes. Conversely reducing RA signaling shifts Hox genes posteriorly in endoderm. These results imply that RA acts as a caudalizing factor in a graded manner in pharyngeal endoderm. Posterior foregut and midgut organ primordia also require RA, but exposing endoderm to additional RA is not sufficient to expand these primordia anteriorly. We show that in chick, in contrast to non-Amniotes, RA signaling is not only necessary during gastrulation, but also throughout gut tube folding during somitogenesis. Our results show that the induction of CdxA, a midgut marker, and pancreas induction require direct RA signaling in endoderm. Moreover, communication between CdxA(+) cells is necessary to maintain CdxA expression, therefore synchronizing the cells of the midgut primordium. We further show that the RA pathway acts synergistically with FGF4 in endoderm patterning rather than mediating FGF4 activit.
establishes that retinoic acid (RA) signaling coordinates the position of different endoderm organs along the antero-posterior axis in chick embryos and could serve as a basis for the differentiation of specific endodermal organs from ES cell.
lation during development is an important biological activity that leads to synthesis of biomolecules at specific locations and specific times. The single tropomyosin gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, tmy-1/lev-11, produces four isoforms of protein: two from the external promoter and two from the internal promoter. We investigated the internal promoter of tropomyosin to identify sequences that regulate expression of tmy-1 in the pharynx and intestine. By promoter deletion of tmy-1 reporters as well as by database analyses, a 100-bp fragment that contained binding sequences for a GATA factor, for a chicken CdxA homolog, and for a forkhead factor was identified. Both the forkhead and CdxA binding sequences contributed to pharyngeal and intestinal expression. In addition, the GATA site also influenced intestinal expression of tmy-1 reporter. We showed that ELT-2 and PHA-4 proteins interact directly with the GATA and forkhead binding sequences, respectively, in gel mobility shift assays. RNA interference knockdown of elt-2 diminished tmy-1::gfp expression in the intestine. In contrast to RNA interference knockdown of pha-4, expression of tmy-1::gfp in pha-4;smg-1 mutants was slightly weaker than that of the wild type. Ectopic expression of PHA-4 and ELT-2 by heat shock was sufficient to elicit widespread expression of tmy-1::lacZ reporter in embryos. We found no indication of a synergistic relation between ELT-2 and PHA-4. Based on our data, PHA-4 and CdxA function as general transcription factors for pharyngeal and intestinal regulation of tmy-1. We present models by which ELT-2, PHA-4, and CdxA orchestrate expression from the internal promoter of tmy-.
e marker protein-30 (SMP30), whose expression declines during aging in rat liver, has been proposed as an important aging marker. Besides apoptosis, SMP30 also protects cells against various other injuries by enhancement of membrane calcium-pump activity. The mechanism of this differential gene expression mechanism is not known. DNA-protein interactions, mutation analysis and luciferase reporter assay studies have been performed to elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of SMP30 gen.
haracterized up to -2750 bp of the promoter by DNA-protein interactions studies. Twenty eight transcription factor binding sites have been identified by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Transient transfection of 5' and 3' -deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region between -128/+157 bp is sufficient to drive promoter activity. We have mapped an essential regulatory region between -513 to -352 bp which causes a drastic decline of reporter activity. This region contains CdxA, GATA2 and SRY transcription factor binding sites. Individual mutation of these three sites showed increase in reporter activity. Mutation in SRY site (-403/-368) showed maximum increase in reporter activity among these three sites. Therefore, we suggest that SRY like protein may be acting as a strong repressor of SMP30 gene along with CdxA and GATA-2. We also report that mutation of both Sp1 (172/-148 bp) and a C/EBPbeta (-190/-177 bp) transcription binding site located adjacent to each other on SMP30 gene promoter, causes a significant enhancement in reporter activity than individual mutation, thus may be causing the repression of SMP30 promoter activit.
dies provide novel insights into the mechanism that regulate SMP30 gene expressio.
DNA-binding with one finger) proteins are plant transcription factors that have a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, called the Dof domain. The Dof domain, which is composed of 52 amino acid residues, is similar to the Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain of GATA1 and steroid hormone receptors, but has a longer putative loop than that in the case of these zinc finger domains. The DNA-binding function of ascorbate oxidase gene binding protein (AOBP), a Dof protein, was investigated by gel retardation analysis. When Cys was replaced by His, the Dof domain could not function as a Cys3/His- or a Cys2/His2-type zinc finger. The characteristic longer loop was essential for DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, heavy metals such as Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), Fe(II), and Fe(III) inhibited the DNA-binding activity of the Dof domain. Manganese ion as well as zinc ion was coordinated by the Dof domain in vitro. On the other hand, the analysis using inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed that the Dof domain contained zinc ion but not manganese ion. Thus, the Dof domain was proved to function as a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger domai.
peroxide (H2O2) has previously been shown to inhibit the DNA binding activity of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), the accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein and erythropoietin (Epo) gene expression. Epo gene expression has been previously shown to be down-regulated through a GATA binding site at its promoter region. In this study, the effect of H2O2 on Epo gene expression under hypoxic conditions through a GATA transcription factor was investigated. Hypoxic induction was found to be inhibited upon the addition of H2O2, and this effect could be reversed through the addition of catalase. Hypoxic induction was found to be suppressed by co-transfection with a human GATA-2 cDNA expression plasmid. Transfection of Hep3B cells with a reporter gene bearing a mutation at the promoter GATA binding site was found to be only mildly affected by the addition of H2O2. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays (EMSAs), using the Epo promoter GATA site as a probe and the GATA-2 protein extracted from Hep3B cells, showed that addition of H2O2 enhanced the binding of GATA-2 while addition of catalase inhibited this binding. From these results, we conclude that H2O2 increases the binding activity of GATA-2 in a specific manner, thereby suppressing the activity of the Epo promoter and thus inhibiting Epo gene expressio.
nd biochemical studies have established that the sole function of the Escherichia coli DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE heat shock proteins in plasmid P1 DNA replication is to convert RepA dimers to monomers. Monomers bind avidly to oriP1 DNA and initiate DNA replication. However, with purified heat shock proteins, only DnaJ, DnaK, and ATP were required for the monomerization of RepA; GrpE was not required. We have found reaction conditions that mimic the physiological situation. GrpE function is absolutely necessary for RepA activation in vitro with DnaJ and DnaK when the free Mg2+ concentration is maintained at a level of approximately 1 microM by a metal ion buffer system. EDTA or physiological metabolites, including citrate, phosphate, pyrophosphate, and ATP, all elicit the GrpE requirement. With these metal ion-buffering systems, GrpE specifically lowers the concentration of Mg2+ required for the RepA activation reaction. The absence of Mg2+ blocks activation and high levels of Mg2+ in solution bypass the requirement for GrpE but not for the other two heat shock proteins. Our results imply that GrpE facilitates the utilization of Mg2+ for an essential step in RepA activatio.
naptic action of Bothriopsis bilineata smaragdina (forest viper) venom and Bbil-TX, an Asp49 PLA2 from this venom, was examined in detail in mouse phrenic nerve-muscle (PND) preparations in&nbsp;vitro and in a neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH) in order to gain a better insight into the mechanism of action of the venom and associated Asp49 PLA2. In low Ca(2+) solution, venom (3μg/ml) caused a quadriphasic response in PND twitch height whilst at 10μg/ml the venom additionally induced an abrupt and marked initial contracture followed by neuromuscular facilitation, rhythmic oscillations of nerve-evoked twitches, alterations in baseline and progressive blockade. The venom slowed the relaxation phase of muscle twitches. In low Ca(2+), Bbil-TX [210nM (3μg/ml)] caused a progressive increase in PND twitch amplitude but no change in the decay time constant. Venom (10μg/ml) and Bbil-TX (210nM) caused minor changes in the compound action potential (CAP) amplitude recorded from sciatic nerve preparations, with no significant effect on rise time and latency; tetrodotoxin (3.1nM) blocked the CAP at the end of the experiments. In mouse triangularis sterni nerve-muscle (TSn-m) preparations, venom (10μg/ml) and Bbil-TX (210nM) significantly reduced the perineural waveform associated with the outward K(+) current while the amplitude of the inward Na(+) current was not significantly affected. Bbil-TX (210nM) caused a progressive increase in the quantal content of TSn-m preparations maintained in low Ca(2+) solution. Venom (3μg/ml) and toxin (210nM) increased the calcium fluorescence in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells loaded with Fluo3 AM and maintained in low or normal Ca(2+) solution. In normal Ca(2+), the increase in fluorescence amplitude was accompanied by irregular and frequent calcium transients. In TSn-m preparations loaded with Fluo4 AM, venom (10μg/ml) caused an immediate increase in intracellular Ca(2+) followed by oscillations in fluorescence and muscle contracture; Bbil-TX did not change the calcium fluorescence in TSn-m preparations. Immunohistochemical analysis of toxin-treated PND preparations revealed labeling of junctional ACh receptors but a loss of the presynaptic proteins synaptophysin and SNAP25. Together, these data confirm the presynaptic action of Bbil-TX and show that it involves modulation of K(+) channel activity and presynaptic protein expressio.
ons have important roles in cellular processes including intracellular signaling, protein folding, enzyme activation and initiation of programmed cell death. Cells maintain low levels of calcium in their cytosol in order to regulate these processes. When activation of calcium-dependent processes is needed, cells can release calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol to initiate the processes. This can also initiate activation of plasma membrane channels that allow entry of additional calcium from the extracellular milieu. The change in calcium levels is referred to as calcium flux. A key protein involved in initiation of calcium flux is Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1), which has recently been identified as a sensor of ER calcium levels. STIM1 is an ER transmembrane protein that is activated by a drop in ER calcium levels. Upon activation, STIM1 interacts with a plasma membrane protein, ORAI1, to activate ORAI-containing calcium-selective plasma membrane channels. Dysregulation of calcium flux has been reported in cancers, autoimmune diseases and other diseases. STIM1 is a promising target in drug discovery due to its key role early in calcium flux. Here we review the involvement and importance of STIM1 in diseases and why STIM1 is a viable target for drug discovery. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Calcium signaling in health and disease. Guest Editors: Geert Bultynck, Jacques Haiech, Claus W. Heizmann, Joachim Krebs, and Marc Morea.
 and subsequent acidosis, induces neuronal death following brain injury. Oxidative stress is believed to be a key component of this neuronal degeneration. Acute chemical ischemia (azide in the absence of external glucose) and acidosis (external media buffered to pH 6.0) produce increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inward membrane currents in cultured rat cortical neurons. Two α-tocopherol analogues, trolox and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and the spin trapping molecule α-Phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) were used to determine the role of free radicals in these responses. PBN and BHT inhibited the initial transient increases in [Ca2+]i, produced by ischemia, acidosis and acidic ischemia and increased steady state levels in response to acidosis and the acidic ischemia. BHT and PBN also potentiated the rate at which [Ca2+]i increased after the initial transients during acidic ischemia. Trolox inhibited peak and sustained increases in [Ca2+]i during ischemia. BHT inhibited ischemia induced initial inward currents and trolox inhibited initial inward currents activated by acidosis and acidic ischemia. Given the inconsistent results obtained using these antioxidants, it is unlikely their effects were due to elimination of free radicals. Instead, it appears these compounds have non-specific effects on the ion channels and exchangers responsible for these response.
very technology (FDT) uses surfactant based foam to immobilize subsurface contaminants in situ. Where traditional approaches are impractical, FDT has the potential to overcome many of the technical challenges facing the remediation of contaminated deep vadose zone environments. However, little is known about the effects these reactive chemicals may have on microorganisms inhabiting the contaminated subsurface. In addition, there are currently no standard assays to assess microbial responses to subsurface remedial treatments while these agents are under development. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid laboratory assay to assess the potential growth inhibition and/or stimulation of microorganisms following exposure to candidate FDT components. Calcium polysulfide (CPS) and several surfactants (i.e. sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) and NINOL40-CO) have diverse chemistries and are candidate components of FDT. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cultures were exposed to a range of concentrations of these chemicals to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the growth and viability potential of these components. Concentrations of SDS higher than 700 μM were toxic to S. oneidensis MR-1 growth over the course of four days of exposure. The relative acute toxicity order for these compounds was SDS &gt; CPS &gt; NINOL 40-CO&gt;SLES≥CAPB. Dose dependent growth decreases (20-100mM) were observed in the CAPB and SLES treated cultures and both CPS and NINOL 40-CO were toxic at all concentrations tested (1.45-7.25 mM CPS). Both SLES (20-100mM) and SDS at lower concentrations (20-500 μM) were stimulatory to S. oneidensis MR-1 indicating a capacity to be used as a carbon source. These studies also identified potentially key component characteristics, such as precipitate formation and oxygen availability, which may prove valuable in assessing the response of subsurface microorganisms. This benchtop system provides a capability to assess adverse microbial-remediation responses and contributes to the development of in situ remedial chemistries before they are deployed in the fiel.
n of ozone is a major health risk in industrialized nations. Ozone can impair lung function and induce respiratory symptoms through sensory neural-mediated pathways, yet the specific interaction of ozone with airway sensory nerves has yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate, using a vagally innervated ex vivo tracheal-lung mouse preparation, that ozone selectively and directly evokes action potential discharge in a subset of nociceptive bronchopulmonary nerves, namely slow conducting C-fibres. Sensitivity to ozone correlated with the transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 agonist, cinnamaldehyde, with ozone having no effect on cinnamaldehyde-insensitive fibres. C-fibre responses to ozone were abolished by ruthenium red (TRP inhibitor). Ozone also stimulated a subset of nociceptive sensory neurones isolated from vagal ganglia of wild-type mice, but failed to activate neurones isolated from transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) knockout mice. Ozone activated HEK293 cells transfected with TRPA1, but failed to activate non-transfected HEK293 or HEK293 transfected with the capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. Thus, ozone is not an indiscriminate neuronal activator, but rather it potently and selectively activates a subset of airway C-fibres by directly stimulating TRPA.
iologically mediated sedimentary carbonate deposits, including stromatolites and other microbialites, provide insight into environmental conditions on early Earth. The primary limitation to interpreting these records is our lack of understanding regarding microbial processes and the preservation of geochemical signatures in contemporary microbialite systems. Using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and isotopic analyses, this study describes the identity, metabolic potential and chemical processes of microbial communities from living microbialites from Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico. Metagenomic sequencing revealed a diverse, redox-dependent microbial community associated with the microbialites. The microbialite community is distinct from other marine and freshwater microbial communities, and demonstrates extensive environmental adaptation. The microbialite metagenomes contain a large number of genes involved in the production of exopolymeric substances and the formation of biofilms, creating a complex, spatially structured environment. In addition to the spatial complexity of the biofilm, microbial activity is tightly controlled by sensory and regulatory systems, which allow for coordination of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. Isotopic measurements of the intracrystalline organic matter demonstrate the importance of heterotrophic respiration of photoautotrophic biomass in the precipitation of calcium carbonate. The genomic and stable isotopic data presented here significantly enhance our evolving knowledge of contemporary biomineralization processes, and are directly applicable to studies of ancient microbialite.
cle expands the author's presentation at the First American Cough Conference in New York City, June 8-9, 2007. The results of a scientific literature search and application of personal research findings are included. A new hypothesis to explain irritant-induced cough as a being a dysfunction of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) cation channels located in pulmonary excitable cells is presented. The TRPV1 cation channels regulate cellular transmembrane voltage by raising intracellular Ca(2+) and Na(+) concentrations and depolarizing sensory nerve cells containing C-fibers. The discussion centers on the &quot;capsaicin receptor&quot; (TRPV1) and another important ion channel, TRPA1. The author reviews results of published scientific investigations to support his contention that neural events, initiated by TRPV1 ion channels, lead to a cascade of alterations that progress to a cough endpoint. A potential mechanism to explain chronic cough in conditions where there is repeated or severe irritant-induced airway epithelial injury (e.g., RADS) is through persistent TRPV1 channel activation (e.g., TRPV1pathy) with accumulation of inflammatory mediators, tachykinins, and the release of neurotrophins leading to persistent cough and airway inflammation. The significance of the hypothesis is that, if proven, it may provide new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of chronic coug.
sition of ion channels is critical to the formation of neuronal pathways in the peripheral and central nervous systems. This study describes the different types of inward currents (Ii) recorded from the soma of isolated cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) cells of the embryonic chicken, Gallus gallus. Cells were isolated for whole-cell tight-seal recording from embryonic day (ED) 3, an age when the CVG is a cell cluster, to ED 9, an age when the cochlear and vestibular ganglia (CG, VG) are distinct structures. Results show Na+ and Ca2+ currents (INa and ICa) are acquired by ED 3, although INa dominates with greater density levels that peak by ED 6-7 in VG neurons. In the CG, INa acquisition is slower, reaching peak values by ED 8-9. Isolation of ICa, using Ba2+ as the charge carrier, showed both transient (IBaT)- and sustained (IBaL)-type currents on ED 3. Unlike INa, IBa density varied with age and ganglion. Total IBa increased steadily, showing a decline only in CG cells on ED 8-9 as a result of a decrease in IBaT. IBaL density increased over time, reaching a maximum on ED 6-7 in VG cells, followed by a decline on ED 8-9. In comparison, IBaL in CG neurons, did not increase significantly beyond mean values measured on ED 5. The early onset of these currents and the variations in Ca2+ channel expression between the ganglia suggests that intracellular signals relevant to phenotypic differentiation begin within these early time frame.
 discovery of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) more than 20 years ago, numerous studies have focused on the mechanisms regulating ANP secretion. From a physiological standpoint, the most important factor governing ANP secretion is mechanical stretching of the atria, which normally occurs when extracellular fluid volume or blood volume is elevated. In addition, the ability of several vasoconstrictors to increase ANP secretion can be traced to their indirect effects on atrial stretch via increases in cardiac preload or afterload. Whether vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and vasopressin have a direct positive or negative effect on ANP secretion has not been determined with certainty. Two paracrine factors derived from endothelial cells play important roles in modulating ANP secretion. Endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor, stimulates ANP secretion and augments stretch induced ANP secretion. The dramatic increase in ANP release produced by cardiac ischemia appears to be mediated in part by endothelin. Nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator, is also produced by endothelial cells and inhibits ANP secretion acting through cyclic GMP as an intracellular messenger. Several recent studies have helped to define the cellular mechanism contributing to regulation of ANP secretion including stretch-activated ion channels, prostaglandins, cytochrome P450, G proteins and cell calcium. A number of steps in the cellular transduction of the ANP signal remain to be resolved. The release of ANP in disease states such as myocardial infarction and heart failure appears to be related to both mechanical and cellular event.
 (S100A6) is a cell-specific, calcium binding protein of the S100 family whose expression is augmented in many types of cancer. By means of luciferase activity assays, RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization, we established that transcription of S100A6 gene is increased by agents known to evoke oxidative stress. Mutation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) located at position -290/-281 of the calcyclin gene promoter, and overlapping the E-box sequence recognized by the upstream stimulatory factor (USF), led to inhibition of calcyclin gene promoter activity stimulated by cadmium ions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with the -302/-260 calcyclin gene promoter fragment revealed, apart from USF binding, the presence of another protein complex (N) shown by competitive EMSA to be bound to ARE. DNA affinity chromatography followed by Western blot showed the binding of Nrf2 transcription factor to the immobilized calcyclin gene promoter fragment and concomitant appearance of complex N in EMSA of the eluted fractions. The results indicate that agents evoking oxidative stress activate calcyclin gene via the ARE sequence in its promote.
cy and mechanism of action of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) for producing coronary vasodilation was investigated in the isolated perfused heart of the rat. VIP reduced coronary vascular resistance in a dose-dependent manner, starting at 1 x 10(-10) M, and maximally reduced coronary vascular resistance by 49% at 1 x 10(-8) M. The potency of VIP for reducing coronary vascular resistance (EC50=3.02 x 10(-10) M) was considerably greater than that of adenosine (EC50=6.17 x 10(-8) M) and sodium nitroprusside (EC50=2.45 x 10(-6) M). The vasodilatory action of VIP was more easily observed after increasing vascular tone by perfusion of the hearts with a modified physiological solution containing reduced concentrations of potassium (3.2 mM) and calcium (1.2 mM). Under these conditions, VIP maximally reduced coronary resistance by 54% at 7 x 10(-9) M. The potency of VIP for reducing coronary resistance in these hearts, however, decreased 16-fold (EC50=4.90 x 10(-9) M) while that of SNP remained unaltered (EC50=3.39 x 10(-6) M), compared with hearts perfused with higher levels of potassium (5.9 mM) and calcium (2.5 mM). The vasodilatory effect of VIP occurred without a significant change in heart rate, myocardial contractility or oxygen consumption. In additional studies, the dose-dependent effect of VIP on cyclic nucleotide release from the heart was determined by infusing VIP into the coronary circulation in a cumulative fashion to produce final concentrations between 1 x 10(-11) and 1 x 10(-9) M. VIP increased cyclic AMP at 1 x 10(-9) M but did not increase cyclic GMP. Studies using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated the presence of two VIP receptor subtypes, VPAC1 and VPAC2, in the arteries and arterioles of the heart. In conclusion, VIP is a potent vasodilator in the coronary circulation of the rat and the role of VIP in the control of coronary vascular resistance depends on the circulating levels of potassium and calcium. This vasodilatory effect involves binding to specific coronary cell surface receptors, VPAC1 and/or VPAC2, and is dependent on cyclic AMP only during maximal vasodilatio.
ide (NO) production by endothelial cells in response to bradykinin (Bk) treatment was markedly and synergistically enhanced by cotreatment with sodium orthovanadate (vanadate), a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. This enhancement was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Calcium ionophore- (A23187) activated production of NO was also enhanced by cotreatment with vanadate. No significant changes were found in total endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein or in eNOS distribution between membrane (caveolae) and cytosolic fractions in response to the various treatments. Vanadate had no direct effect on eNOS activity, and lysates prepared from cells treated with vanadate showed little change in specific activity of eNOS. Western blots of immunoprecipitated eNOS showed the presence of a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band at a mass corresponding to approximately 125 kDa and 2 minor bands corresponding to approximately 105 and 75 kDa after treatment with vanadate/Bk. No tyrosine phosphorylation of eNOS after treatment with vanadate/Bk was observed. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90, also inhibited the enhancement of NO production by vanadate/Bk or vanadate/A23187, and there was an increase in the amount of heat shock protein 90 that coimmunoprecipitated with eNOS after treatment with vanadate/Bk. These results show that there is a clear link between tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of eNO production, which does not appear to involve direct modification of eNOS, changes in eNOS levels, or compartmentation, but rather appears to be due to changes in proteins associating with eNOS, thereby enhancing the state of activation of eNO.
ional importance of Ca++ activated K+ (K(Ca)) channels in cGMP mediated relaxation of pressurized septal arteries (internal basal diameter 213 +/- 4 microm) was investigated. Vascular tone was increased by the thromboxane A2 analogue, U-46619 and internal pressure was maintained at 60 mmHg. Vessels were tested with an endothelium independent agonist (nitroprusside) and endothelium dependent agonist (acetylcholine) of nitric oxide which activates soluble guanylate cyclase. Receptor activation of particulate guanylate cyclase was tested by atrial natriuretic peptide. Direct changes in intracellular cGMP concentration were done with the cell permeable analog, 8-Bromo-cGMP. Tetraethylammonium ion (TEA+), 1 mM, significantly inhibited relaxation to nitroprusside from 10(-7) to 10(-3) M with a maximal inhibition of 53 +/- 8% at 10(-3) M. Relaxation to acetylcholine from 10(-9) M to 10(-5) M was significantly inhibited by TEA+ with a maximal inhibition of 52 +/- 13% at 10(-7) M. TEA+ significantly inhibited relaxation to 8-Bromo-cGMP from 10(-6) M to 10(-3) M with a maximal inhibition of 59 +/- 14% at 10(-4) M. The relaxation response to atrial natriuretic peptide from 10(-12) M to 10(-7) M was significantly inhibited by TEA+ with a maximal inhibition of 84 +/- 5% at 10(-11) M. The large conductance K(Ca) channel blocker, iberiotoxin, eliminated the relaxation response to 8-Bromo-cGMP (10(-3) M). The results suggest that a large portion of the dilator action of cGMP is mediated by effects on K+ membrane channel.
hesis for this study is that block of calcium activated potassium (KCa) channels inhibits cAMP induced relaxation in pressurized rat coronary resistance arteries. Pressure-diameter experiments with septal arteries (200-270 microns internal diameter at 60 mmHg and maximum dilation) showed significant basal tone over a range of pressure from 40-120 mmHg. The level of tone was increased with the thromboxane A2 analogue 9,11-dideoxy-11 alpha, 9 alpha-epoxy-methanoprostaglandin F2 alpha (U46619) in all experiments. Receptor activation of the cAMP pathway was done with adenosine (ADO) and isoproterenol (ISO). Tetraethylammonium ion (TEA+), 1mM, significantly inhibited relaxation to ADO (10(-6)-10(-3)M) with a maximal inhibition of 75 +/- 7% (as a % of maximum diameter change with the vasodilator alone) at 10(-3)M ADO. TEA+ inhibited ISO (10(-6)M) relaxation by 63 +/- 9%. Direct activation of the cAMP pathway was done with forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP. TEA+ significantly inhibited forskolin (10(-6)-10(-4)M) induced relaxation with a maximal inhibition of 81.3 +/- 1.2% at 10(-4)M forskolin. TEA+ and iberiotoxin (10(-7)M) significantly inhibited 8- bromo-cAMP (10(-3)M) induced relaxation by 72 +/- 5% and 56 +/- 3% respectively. The effect of TEA+ on relaxation induced by nitroprusside (a cGMP dependent vasodilator) was not significant. The results show that rat coronary resistance arteries possess significant myogenic tone and modulation of Kca channels plays a major role in cAMP mediated relaxatio.
a novel coregulator of nuclear hormone receptors and is implicated in playing a role in driving breast cancer and enhancing metastatic potential. The PELP1 protein expression and potential role of PELP1 in triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) have not been well characterized. We investigated PELP1 expression by immunohistochemistry in primary and metastatic triple-negative tumors in human tissues and compared its expression with GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), a novel diagnostic marker for TNBC. We examined the expression of PELP1 and GATA3 in 70 primary TNBC cases and found that PELP1 had a significantly higher frequency of expression compared to GATA3 (96% versus 46%; P &lt; .0001). The mean extent score of expression of PELP1 was also significantly higher than GATA3's expression (3.87 ± 0.07 versus 0.91 ± 0.15; P &lt; .0001). PELP1 had stronger staining intensity than GATA3. Furthermore, PELP1 immunoreactivity was consistently maintained in paired primary and metastatic TNBC cases (100%). The frequency of PELP1 expression (100%) in metastatic triple-negative tumors was higher than that of GATA3 (40%) in the same tumors (P &lt; .0001). These findings indicate that PELP1 is a much more sensitive marker than GATA3 for TNBCs. PELP1 may have diagnostic utility for metastatic TNBC in appropriate settings, such as history of primary TNBC in cases where the primary is negative for GATA3, mammaglobin, and GCDFP-15. The diffuse and strong nuclear immunoreactivity of PELP1 in most cases suggests that PELP1 may be a molecular target for the treatment of TNBC. We hope that this study will provide insights into the role of PELP1 in TNB.
tor of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation was isolated from Streptomyces sp. TK08330 and identified by spectroscopy as the 18-membered macrolide borrelidin. Treatment with 1.0 μM borrelidin suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation by 80% and inhibited the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. Borrelidin suppressed the mRNA expression of two master regulators of adipocyte differentiation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα). Studies on well-known upstream regulators of PPARγ revealed that borrelidin down-regulated C/EBPδ mRNA expression but did not affect expression of C/EBPβ. Borrelidin increased mRNA expression of negative regulators of differentiation such as GATA-binding protein (GATA) 3, Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 3 and KLF7, as well as positive regulators, KLF4, KLF6 and KLF15, at early stages of differentiation. To elucidate a primary mediator of borrelidin differentiation inhibitory activity, small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection experiments were performed. The mRNA expression of PPARγ, which was down-regulated by borrelidin, was not changed by KLF3 and KLF7 siRNA treatment. In contrast, expression of PPARγ in GATA-3 siRNA-treated cells was not significantly different from that of control siRNA-treated cells. Borrelidin significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in control siRNA-treated cells, and treatment with GATA-3 siRNA slightly reduced the inhibitory effect of borrelidin. These results indicate that borrelidin inhibited adipocyte differentiation partially via GATA-.
 (MC) degranulation is the foundation of the acute phase of allergic rhinitis (AR). Previously, downregulation of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was shown to suppress MC activation in an AR mouse model. Binding of microRNA-135a (miR-135a) to GATA-3 was also observed, and overexpression of this miRNA decreased GATA-3 mRNA and protein expression. However, the effects of miR-135a on MCs during AR are currently unknown. In the present study, we utilized a lentiviral (LV) vector to intranasally administer miR-135a to ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized AR mice. Following miR-135a treatment, the total serum IgE concentration observed during AR was significantly reduced. In the nasal mucosa, the expression of T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) was higher, whereas that of GATA-3 was lower in the AR mice following miRNA treatment. Notably, during AR, the ratio of type 1 T-helper cells (Th1) to type 2 (Th2) cells in the spleen is unbalanced, favoring Th2. However, administering miR-135a to the AR mice appeared to balance this ratio by increasing and decreasing the percentage of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. MiR-135a also appeared to strongly suppress the infiltration of eosinophils and MCs into the nasal mucosa, and it was specifically localized in the MCs, suggesting that its influence is modulated through regulation of GATA-3 in these cells. Additional work identifying the full therapeutic potential of miR-135a in the treatment of AR and diseases involving allergen-induced inflammation is warrante.
h2) immune responses play important roles in intestinal immunity by contributing to the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis, not only conferring protection against helminthic infection but also participating in pro-inflammatory pathways in chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease. The current review focuses on recent developments regarding the role of Th2 responses in intestinal inflammatio.
ucosal responses are promoted by mediators that are released following injury to the epithelium, and act as alarmin-type danger signals. Interleukin (IL)-33 is prominent among such factors and demonstrates a dichotomous function, exerting either protective or pro-inflammatory effects, depending on its cellular compartmentalization. The pool of type 2 effector cells has been enriched recently to include not only classical CD4+ Th2 lymphocytes but also a subset of innate lymphocytes (ILC2s) that express the transcriptional factor GATA binding protein 3 and secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. ILC2s play important roles during infection with helminths and bi-directionally interact with Th2 CD4+ lymphocytes, thus establishing a transition from innate to adaptive immunological pathways. Th2 responses are also involved in pro-inflammatory pathways at the intestinal mucosa, and neutralization of the pivotal cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 has been shown to regulate experimental intestinal inflammation. In striking contrast, however, neutralization of human IL-13 had no therapeutic effect in patients with ulcerative coliti.
tudies will be required to delineate the specific mechanisms of type 2 mucosal immunity in inflammatory bowel disease and examine the applicability of Th2-targeted therapies for intestinal inflammatio.
nexal tumors of probable wolffian origin (FATWOs) are rare. They can closely mimic endometrioid adenocarcinomas with a prominent spindle cell component and Sertoli cell tumors (SCTs). To further define their immunohistochemical profile and origin, we investigated the expression of PAX-8, PAX-2, and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) (wolffian markers) and of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (sex-cord stromal marker) in FATWOs. We also studied the expression of PAX-8 and PAX-2 in endometrioid adenocarcinomas; of SF-1 in Sertoli-Leydig cell and SCTs; and of PAX-8, PAX-2, GATA-3, and SF-1 in rete ovarii-a proposed site of origin for FATWOs. A database search yielded 8 FATWOs, 18 ovarian/tubal/paraovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas, and 8 ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell and SCTs. Eleven cases with rete ovarii sections were included. Of the FATWOs studied, all were negative for PAX-8, PAX-2, GATA-3, and SF-1. Of the endometrioid adenocarcinomas studied, PAX-8 was positive in all and PAX-2 was positive in 57%. Of the Sertoli-Leydig cell and SCTs, all were positive for SF-1 except one. The rete ovarii were positive for PAX-8, weakly positive for SF-1, and negative for PAX-2 and GATA-3. Our study suggests that PAX-8 and SF-1 can be helpful in the distinction between FATWOs and endometrioid adenocarcinomas and SCTs, respectively. Our results do not support a Mullerian or sex-cord stromal or rete ovarii origin for FATWOs. It is curious, however, that FATWOs do not express wolffian markers-it is possibly related to their origin from a distinctive portion of the wolffian duc.
e the immunological characteristics of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model and examine the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) treatmen.
o male specififi c pathogen free Spragne-Dawley rats were randomly equally assigned to four groups: control, TNBS, APS and prednisone groups. Experimental colitis was induced by enema administration of TNBS. Then rats were treated with APS (0.5 g•kg(-1)•day(-1), once daily) or prednisone (1.0 mg•kg(-1)•day(-1), once daily) by gavage for 14 days. Macroscopic lesion and histological damage were determined, and activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured in the colonic tissues. Expressions of T-box expressed in T-cells (T-bet) and GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) were determined by immunohistochemistry analysis and western blo.
oscopic lesion and histological colonic damage induced by TNBS were reduced by APS and prednisone treatment. These were accompanied by significant attenuation of MPO activity (P=0.03). TNBS intervention enhanced the expression of both GATA-3 and T-bet, but the expression of T-bet was signififi cantly enhanced than that of GATA-3, resulting in signififi cant reduction of GATA-3/T-bet ratio (P=0.025). APS administration enhanced the expression of T-bet (P=0.04) and GATA-3 (P=0.019) in comparison to TNBS group, and resulting in an up-regulated GATA-3/T-bet ratio. Prednisone treatment inhibited both expressions; however it also resulted in up-regulation of the GATA-3/T-bet rati.
ults demonstrated that APS exerted a benefifi cial immune regulatory effect on experimental colitis. It promoted the expression of T helper cell 1 (Th1) and T helper cell 2 (Th2) specififi c transcription factors but ultimately favor a shift toward Th2 phenotype, suggesting that APS possessed therapeutic potential in experimental coliti.
nction between metastatic breast carcinomas (BCs) and primary lung carcinomas (PLCs) can be difficult. This study tested the utility of trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) for this purpose and compared it with mammaglobin and GATA protein binding 3 (GATA-3.
croarrays containing 365 BCs and 338 PLCs were stained with TFF1, mammaglobin, and GATA-3, and an H-score was calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated, and logistical regression analysis was performe.
of correctly classifying the tumor type was 81.9%, 71.3%, and 64.0% for GATA-3, mammaglobin, and TFF1, respectively. Odds ratios for selecting BCs were 25.69, 93.15, and 4.17, respectively, with P values less than .001. With a single exception, the best immunopanel included GATA-3 and mammaglobin in all comparison.
nstrated breast specificity but was inferior to mammaglobin and GATA-3. Therefore, its routine clinical use may not be justified. TFF1 showed little benefit when added to an immunopane.
, impacts of exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cardiovascular system are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TiO2 NPs induce myocarditis and its underlying molecular mechanism in the cardiac inflammation in mice. Mice were exposed to TiO2 NPs for 6&nbsp;months; biochemical parameters of serum and expression of Th1-related and Th2-related cytokines in the heart were investigated. The results showed that TiO2 NP exposure resulted in cardiac lesions coupling with pulmonary inflammation; increases of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), C-reaction protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels; and a reduction of nitric oxide (NOx) level in the serum. These were associated with increases of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), creatine kinase, CRP, adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3, or STAT6, GATA-binding domain-3, GATA-binding domain-4, endothelin-1 expression levels, and T-box expressed in T cells expression level that is the master regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors in the heart. These findings imply that TiO2 NP exposure may increase the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease.
ic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a rare type of breast cancer. Metastases to the lung, which can be a major site of second primary tumor development among breast cancer patients, are difficult to distinguish from primary SCC of the lung and present a unique challenge for pathologists. There are few available discriminating immunohistochemical markers as squamous differentiation typically leads to loss of expression of characteristic primary epithelial cell markers of both breast and lung origin. GATA protein binding 3 (GATA-3) is a useful marker of breast origin in metastatic ductal and lobular carcinomas including poorly differentiated triple-negative carcinomas and some metaplastic carcinomas. Here, we present a case of metastatic SCC presenting as a solitary lung mass with regional lymph node metastases and a single satellite lesion in a patient with a history of metaplastic SCC of the breast. In addition to the routine markers of squamous differentiation, the metastases were also positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and GATA-3 on cytologic material obtained by transbronchial FNA. This suggests that immunoreactivity for ER and GATA-3 may support a diagnosis of metastatic SCC in the context of a prior metaplastic SCC of the breast. Diagn.

and ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) complex locus (MECOM) gene encodes several transcription factor variants including MDS1-EVI1, EVI1 and EVI1Δ324. Although MDS1-EVI1 has been associated with tumor-suppressing activity, EVI1 is a known oncogene in various cancers, whose expression is associated with poor patient survival. Although EVI1Δ324 is co-transcribed with EVI1, its activity in cancer cells is not fully understood. Previous reports described that unlike EVI1, EVI1Δ324 protein cannot transform fibroblasts because of its disrupted N-terminal zinc finger (ZNF) domain. To better understand EVI1Δ324 biology and function, we obtained genome-wide binding occupancies and expression data in ovarian cancer cells. We characterized its DNA-binding sites, binding motif and target genes. Comparative analyses with previous study show that EVI1 and EVI1Δ324 share similar transcriptional activities linked to their common C-terminus ZNF domain. They bind to an E-twenty-six family (ETS)-like motif, target to a large extent the same genes and cooperate with AP1 transcription factor. EVI1Δ324-occupied genes were 70.7% similar to EVI1-bound genes. More strikingly, EVI1 and EVI1Δ324 differentially expressed genes were 99.87% identical, indicating comparable transcriptional regulatory functions. Consistently with gene ontologies linked to these target genes, EVI1Δ324 expression in HeLa cells could enhance anchorage-independent growth, such as EVI1, showing that EVI1Δ324 expression also lead to pro-oncogenic effects. The main specific feature of EVI1 variant is its N-terminus ZNF domain that binds DNA through GATA-like motif. We found that most GATA-like EVI1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing peaks are far from genes and are not involved in transcriptional regulation. These genomic regions were enriched in simple sequence repeats and displayed high meiotic recombination rates. Overall, our genomics analyses uncovered common and specific features of two major MECOM isoforms. Their influence on transcription and downstream cell proliferation was comparable. However, EVI1-specific GATA-like binding sites, from its N-terminus ZNF domain, associated with high recombination rates, suggesting possible additional oncogenic potential for EVI1 in modulating genomic stability.Oncogene advance online publication, 3 August 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.28.
Down syndrome (DS) patients have a higher risk of developing transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute leukemia, very little data is available on long-term outcome in Taiwanese patients. The current study was designed to determine the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of DS patients with TMD or acute leukemia (AL.
secutive DS patients with TMD or AL enrolled from 1990 to 2012, clinical manifestations and treatment protocols were investigated and GATA1 (GATA binding protein 1) mutations were identified. Among 16 DS-acute myeloid leukemia (DS-AML) patients, clinical outcomes were compared between survivors and nonsurvivor.
ur DS patients had TMD (32%), acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (24%), or acute erythromegakaryoblastic leukemia (16%). The median follow-up time was 22.5 months (1-230 months). The age was younger and the hemoglobin (Hb) level and platelet count were higher in TMD patients than in leukemia patients. Among DS-AML patients, the Hb level was higher in survivors than nonsurvivors (8.8&nbsp;±&nbsp;2.7&nbsp;g/dL vs. 5.8&nbsp;±&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;g/dL; p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.044) and the age was older in relapsed patients than in nonrelapsed patients (43.8&nbsp;±&nbsp;18 months old vs. 21.6&nbsp;±&nbsp;8.6 months old; p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.025). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 44%, higher in patients receiving appropriate chemotherapy than in those receiving inadequate treatment (63.6% vs. 0%, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001), and higher in those diagnosed with TMD or AL after 2008 than before 2008 (33.3% vs. 75%; p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.119.
n DS-AML patients is optimal if appropriate treatment is provided. With modification of the treatment strategy in 2008, OS increased in Taiwa.
ing growth factor (TGF)-β and interleukin (IL)-13 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), partly through activation of collagen production that leads to fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether TFG-β alters IL-13 production in T lymphocytes from patients with SSc from that seen in those of healthy donor.
A and protein synthesis under TFG-β exposure was measured in circulating T lymphocytes from healthy donors and patients with SSc and also in the Jurkat Th2 T-cell line, using quantitative real-time PCR and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, respectively. The involvement of Smad and GATA-3 transcription factors was assessed by using specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA, and the binding capacity of GATA-3 to the IL-13 gene promoter was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assa.
uced a significant decrease in IL-13 mRNA and protein levels in lymphocytes from healthy donors (mean [±SD] inhibition of 30% ± 10% and 20% ± 7%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, TGF-β promoted a significant increase in IL-13 mRNA levels and IL-13 synthesis by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subtypes from patients with SSc, with respective increases of 2.4 ± 0.3-fold, 1.6 ± 0.05-fold and 2.7 ± 0.02-fold. The involvement of the Smad signaling pathway and upregulation of GATA-3 binding capacity on the IL-13 promoter in lymphocytes from patients with SSc contributed to the effect of TGF-β on IL-13 productio.
ults demonstrate that TGF-β upregulates IL-13 synthesis through GATA-3 expression in the T lymphocytes of patients with SSc, confirming that the GATA-3 transcription factor can be regarded as a novel therapeutic target in patients with SS.
egerin (OPG) is a key regulator of bone remodeling. Mutations in OPG are involved in a variety of human diseases. We have shown that cochlear spiral ganglion cells secrete OPG at high levels and lack of OPG causes sensorineural hearing loss in addition to the previously described conductive hearing loss. In order to study the regulation of OPG expression, we conducted a database search on regulatory elements in the promoter region of the OPG gene, and identified two potential GATA-3 binding sites. Using luciferase assays and site directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that these two elements are GATA-3 responsive and support GATA-3 transactivation in human HEK and HeLa cells. The expression of wild type GATA-3 activated OPG mRNA and protein expression, while the expression of a dominant negative mutant of GATA-3 or a GATA-3 shRNA construct reduced OPG mRNA and protein levels. GATA-3 deficient cells generated by expressing a GATA-3 shRNA construct were sensitive to apoptosis induced by etoposide and TNF-α. This apoptotic effect could be partly prevented by the co-treatment with exogenous OPG. Our results suggest new approaches to rescue diseases due to GATA-3 deficiency - such as in hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal (HDR) syndrome - by OPG therap.
leomorphic giant cell carcinoma (PGCC) is a variant of urothelial carcinoma (UC) characterized by highly pleomorphic tumour with giant cells. Fewer than 10 cases have been reported, and our aim was to determine the clinical and pathological features of a series of tumours from a specialized uropathology laborator.
cases of PGCC of the bladder were identified. There were nine males and four females, ranging in age from 53 to 92&nbsp;years (mean 72&nbsp;years). Associated conventional high-grade UC was seen in eight cases, while three cases also had micropapillary UC and one plasmacytoid UC. UC in&nbsp;situ (CIS) was present in five cases and occasional bizarre cells were seen in both UC and CIS. The proportion of PGCC present varied from 40% to 100% of tumour. Immunostaining performed on 10&nbsp;cases showed uniform positivity for CK 8/18 and AE1/AE3, while most tumours were positive for CK7, CK20, uroplakin III and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3). β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) was negative. Of 10 patients with follow-up, five died within 1&nbsp;year and four are alive with tumou.
iation of PGCC with UC and an overlap in immunoexpression suggests that PGCC represents an extreme form of UC de-differentiatio.
atory established a role for poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) in asthma. To increase the clinical significance of our studies, it is imperative to demonstrate that PARP is actually activated in human asthma, to examine whether a PARP inhibitor approved for human testing such as olaparib blocks already-established chronic asthma traits in response to house dust mite (HDM), a true human allergen, in mice and to examine whether the drug modulates human cluster of differentiation type 4 (CD4(+)) T-cell function. To conduct the study, human lung specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a HDM-based mouse asthma model were used. Our results show that PARP is activated in PBMCs and lung tissues of asthmatics. PARP inhibition by olaparib or gene knockout blocked established asthma-like traits in mice chronically exposed to HDM including airway eosinophilia and hyper-responsiveness. These effects were linked to a marked reduction in T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production without a prominent effect on interferon (IFN)-γ or interleukin (IL)-10. PARP inhibition prevented HDM-induced increase in overall cellularity, weight and CD4(+) T-cell population in spleens of treated mice whereas it increased the T-regulatory cell population. In CD3/CD28-stimulated human CD4 (+)T-cells, olaparib treatment reduced Th2 cytokine production potentially by modulating GATA binding protein-3 (gata-3)/IL-4 expression while moderately affecting T-cell proliferation. PARP inhibition inconsistently increased IL-17&nbsp;in HDM-exposed mice and CD3/CD28-stimulated CD4(+) T cells without a concomitant increase in factors that can be influenced by IL-17. In the present study, we provide evidence for the first time that PARP-1 is activated in human asthma and that its inhibition is effective in blocking established asthma in mic.
understanding of the mechanism and manipulation of the tightly regulated cellular differentiation process of adipogenesis may contribute to a reduction in obesity and diabetes. Multiple transcription factors and signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of adipogenesis. Here, we report that the AMP-activated protein kinase activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) can activate AMPK in preadipocytes and thus increase the expression of GATA3, an anti-adipogenic factor. However, AICAR-increased GATA3 is mediated by the stimulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in preadipocytes. Mechanistically, AICAR-activated AMPK inhibits GSK3β through a phosphorylation process that stabilizes β-catenin. This stabilized β-catenin then translocates into nucleus where it interacts with T-cell factors (TCF), leading to the increased β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity that induces GATA3 expression. In addition, AICAR also relieves the repressing effect of the C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) co-repressor by diverting CtBP away from the β-catenin·TCF complex at the GATA3 promoter. The anti-adipogenic effect of GATA3 and AICAR is consistently attenuated by the disruption of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, GATA3 suppresses key adipogenic regulators by binding to the promoters of these regulators, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) gene, and the disruption of Wnt/β-catenin signaling reduces the GATA3 binding at the PPARγ promoter. In differentiated adipocytes, GATA3 expression inhibition is facilitated by the down-regulation of β-catenin levels, the reduction in β-catenin binding, and the increase in CtBP binding at the GATA3 promoter. Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of adipogenesis by suggesting that different regulation pathways and adipogenic regulators collectively modulate adipocyte differentiation through cross-tal.
stion in cancer systems biology is how to use molecular data to predict the biological behavior of tumors from individual patients. While genomics data have been heavily used, protein signaling data are more directly connected to biological phenotype and might predict cancer phenotypes such as invasion, metastasis, and patient survival. In this study, we mined publicly available data for colorectal adenocarcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas and identified protein expression and signaling changes that are statistically associated with patient outcome. Our analysis identified a number of known and potentially new regulators of colorectal cancer. High levels of insulin growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) were associated with both recurrence and death, and this was validated by immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray for a secondary patient dataset. Interestingly, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) was the protein most frequently associated with death in our analysis, and GATA3 expression was significantly decreased in tumor samples from stage I-II deceased patients. Experimental studies using engineered colon cancer cell lines show that exogenous expression of GATA3 decreases three-dimensional colony growth and invasiveness of colon cancer cells but does not affect two-dimensional proliferation. These findings suggest that protein data are useful for biomarker discovery and identify GATA3 as a regulator of colorectal cancer&nbsp; aggressivenes.
lls are preadipocytes and often used as a model for cellular differentiation to adipocytes; however, the mechanism of this differentiation is not completely understood even in these model cells. In this study, we sought to identify a unique anti-adipogenesis agent from microorganisms and to examine its mechanism of action to gain knowledge and create a tool and/or seed compound for anti-obesity drug discovery researc.
 for anti-adipogenesis agents from microorganisms was performed using a 3T3-L1 cell differentiation system, and an active compound was isolated. The inhibitory mechanism of the compound was investigated by measuring the expression of key regulators using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysi.
und with anti-adipogenic activity in 3T3-L1 cells was identified as cineromycin B. Cineromycin B at 50μg/mL suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation and the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), which are master regulators of adipocyte differentiation. Further investigations showed that cineromycin B increased significantly the mRNA expression of two negative regulators of adipocyte differentiation, Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 2 and KLF3, at an early stage of the differentiation. The results of siRNA transfection experiments indicated that cineromycin B is a unique adipocyte differentiation inhibitor, acting mainly via upregulation of KLF2 and KLF3, and these KLFs may play a role in the early stage of differentiatio.
in B inhibited adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells mainly via upregulation of KLF2 and KLF3 mRNA expression at an early stage of the differentiatio.
 To explore the mechanism of beta2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI)-caused T helper cell subset differentiation and anti-β2GPI antibody (aβ2GPI Ab) production in mice. Methods The healthy BALB/c mice were randomly divided into two groups: normal saline (NS) group and β2GPI group. The mice were immunized i.v. with either human β2GPI or equal amount of NS for a total of two or four times at 2-week intervals. The titer of aβ2GPI Ab in mice serum was evaluated by indirect ELISA. The expressions of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), interleukin 4 (IL-4), T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Foxp3 mRNAs in mouse splenic cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and the percentage of GATA3(+) or Foxp3(+) cells in lymphocytes of mouse spleen was detected by flow cytometry. Results The high titer (1:100 000) of aβ2GPI Ab was detected in mouse serum following the two times of immunization with β2GPI. The expressions of Th2 specific markers GATA3 and IL-4 mRNAs and the percentage of GATA3(+) cells in lymphocytes were higher than those of NS treated group. After four times of immunization with β2GPI, the titer of aβ2GPI Ab in mouse serum was elevated to a higher level (&gt;1:100 000). The expressions of GATA3, Th1 specific markers T-bet and IFN-γ, and regulatory T cell (Treg) specific marker Foxp3 mRNAs in mouse spleen cells, but no significant change was found in IL-4 mRNA expression. Furthermore, the percentage of GATA3(+) cells in mouse spleen increased, while the percentage of Foxp3(+) cells decreased. Conclusion β2GPI immunization could induce Th2 cell bias polarization and Th1 cell and Treg suppression in mice, which might contribute to the production of aβ2GPI A.
 trophoblastic derivation other than choriocarcinoma are very rare in the testis but have been reported on occasion in association with other germ cell tumors. Their morphologic spectrum is analogous to the trophoblastic tumors of the female genital tract including epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). Herein we report our experience with 8 cases of trophoblastic tumors of testicular origin that lacked the features of choriocarcinoma; these included 4 ETTs, 1 PSTT, 1 unclassified trophoblastic tumor (UTT), 1 partially regressed choriocarcinoma with a monophasic morphology, and 1 hybrid tumor showing a mixture of adenocarcinoma and a UTT. All tumors occurred in young men 19 to 43 years old. Five arose de novo within the testis (2 ETTs, 1 UTT, 1 regressing choriocarcinoma, and the hybrid tumor) as a component of mixed germ cell tumors, and 3 (2 ETTs and 1 PSTT) were found in metastatic sites after chemotherapy. The trophoblastic component was minor (5% to 10%) in 6 tumors but was 95% of 1 metastatic tumor (ETT) and 50% of the hybrid tumor. Other germ cell tumor elements were identified in all cases, most commonly teratoma. The ETTs consisted of nodules and nests of squamoid trophoblast cells showing abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, frequent apoptotic cells, extracellular fibrinoid material, and positivity for p63 and negativity for human placental lactogen (HPL). The PSTT showed sheets of discohesive, pleomorphic, mononucleated trophoblast cells that invaded blood vessels with fibrinoid change and were p63 negative and HPL positive. The UTT showed a spectrum of small and large trophoblast cells, some multinucleated but lacking distinct syncytiotrophoblasts, and was patchily positive for both p63 and HPL. The hybrid tumor had ETT-like and adenocarcinomatous areas that coexpressed inhibin and GATA3 but were negative for p63 and HPL, leading to classification of the trophoblastic component as UTT. Seven of the patients were alive and well on follow-up (8 to 96 mo; median, 39 mo), whereas the patient with the hybrid tumor died of liver metastases at 2 years. Our study verifies that trophoblastic neoplasms often having the features of nonchoriocarcinomatous gestational trophoblastic tumors may arise from the testis, occur either in the untreated primary tumor or in metastases after chemotherapy, and should be distinguished from choriocarcinoma given what appears to be a less aggressive clinical cours.
tastic cascade is a complex process that is regulated at multiple levels in prostate cancer (PCa). Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in PCa metastasis and hold great promise as therapeutic targets. In this study, we found that miR-573 expression is significantly lower in metastatic tissues than matched primary PCa. Its downregulation is correlated with high Gleason score and cancer-related mortality of PCa patients (P = 0.041, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Through gain- and loss-of function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-573 inhibits PCa cell migration, invasion and TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, miR573 directly targets the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene. Knockdown of FGFR1 phenocopies the effects of miR-573 expression on PCa cell invasion, whereas overexpression of FGFR1 partially attenuates the functions of miR-573. Consequently, miR-573 modulates the activation of FGFR1-downstream signaling in response to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Importantly, we showed that GATA3 directly increases miR-573 expression, and thus down-regulates FGFR1 expression, EMT and invasion of PCa cells in a miR-573-dependent manner, supporting the involvement of GATA3, miR-573 and FGFR1 in controlling the EMT process during PCa metastasis. Altogether, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which miR-573 modulates EMT and metastasis of PCa cells, and suggest miR-573 as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for PCa managemen.
lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent histologic subtype of invasive breast cancer. Here, we comprehensively profiled 817 breast tumors, including 127 ILC, 490 ductal (IDC), and 88 mixed IDC/ILC. Besides E-cadherin loss, the best known ILC genetic hallmark, we identified mutations targeting PTEN, TBX3, and FOXA1 as ILC enriched features. PTEN loss associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, which was highest in ILC among all breast cancer subtypes. Spatially clustered FOXA1 mutations correlated with increased FOXA1 expression and activity. Conversely, GATA3 mutations and high expression characterized luminal A IDC, suggesting differential modulation of ER activity in ILC and IDC. Proliferation and immune-related signatures determined three ILC transcriptional subtypes associated with survival differences. Mixed IDC/ILC cases were molecularly classified as ILC-like and IDC-like revealing no true hybrid features. This multidimensional molecular atlas sheds new light on the genetic bases of ILC and provides potential clinical option.
scription factors are zinc finger DNA binding proteins that regulate transcription during development and cell differentiation. The three important GATA transcription factors GATA1, GATA2 and GATA3 play essential roles in the development and maintenance of hematopoietic systems. GATA1 is required for the erythroid and megakaryocytic commitment during hematopoiesis. GATA2 is crucial for the proliferation and survival of early hematopoietic cells, and is also involved in lineage specific transcriptional regulation as the dynamic partner of GATA1. GATA3 plays an essential role in T lymphoid cell development and immune regulation. As a result, mutations in genes encoding the GATA transcription factors or alteration in the protein expression level or their function have been linked to a variety of human hematologic disorders. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge regarding the disrupted biologic function of GATA in various hematologic disorder.
ell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a peripheral T cell neoplasm of largely unknown genetic basis, associated with human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection. Here we describe an integrated molecular study in which we performed whole-genome, exome, transcriptome and targeted resequencing, as well as array-based copy number and methylation analyses, in a total of 426 ATL cases. The identified alterations overlap significantly with the HTLV-1 Tax interactome and are highly enriched for T cell receptor-NF-κB signaling, T cell trafficking and other T cell-related pathways as well as immunosurveillance. Other notable features include a predominance of activating mutations (in PLCG1, PRKCB, CARD11, VAV1, IRF4, FYN, CCR4 and CCR7) and gene fusions (CTLA4-CD28 and ICOS-CD28). We also discovered frequent intragenic deletions involving IKZF2, CARD11 and TP73 and mutations in GATA3, HNRNPA2B1, GPR183, CSNK2A1, CSNK2B and CSNK1A1. Our findings not only provide unique insights into key molecules in T cell signaling but will also guide the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics in this intractable tumo.
cyathostomin larvae are ubiquitous in grazing horses. Arrested development occurs in this population and can lead to an accumulation of encysted larvae. Large numbers of tissue larvae place the horse at risk for developing larval cyathostominosis. This disease complex is caused by mass emergence of these larvae and is characterized by a generalized acute typhlocolitis and manifests itself as a profuse protein-losing watery diarrhea with a reported case-fatality rate of about 50%. Two anthelmintic formulations have a label claim for larvicidal therapy of these encysted stages; moxidectin and a five-day regimen of fenbendazole. There is limited knowledge about inflammatory and immunologic reactions to larvicidal therapy. This study was designed to evaluate blood acute phase reactants as well as gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, both locally in the large intestinal walls and systemically. Further, mucosal tissue samples were evaluated histopathologically as well as analyzed for gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, cluster of differentiation (CD) cell surface proteins, and select transcription factors. Eighteen juvenile horses with naturally acquired cyathostomin infections were randomly assigned to three treatment groups; one group served as untreated controls (Group 1), one received a five-day regimen of fenbendazole (10mg/kg) (Group 2), and one group received moxidectin (0.4mg/kg) (Group 3). Horses were treated on day 0 and euthanatized on days 18-20. Serum and whole blood samples were collected on days 0, 5, and 18. All horses underwent necropsy with collection of tissue samples from the ventral colon and cecum. Acute phase reactants measured included serum amyloid A, iron and fibrinogen, and the cytokines evaluated included interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and interleukins 1β, 4, 5, 6, and 10. Transcription factors evaluated were FoxP3, GATA3 and tBet, and CD markers included CD163, CD3z, CD4, CD40, and CD8b. Histopathology revealed an inflammatory reaction with higher levels of lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, eosinophils and fibrous tissue in the moxidectin-treated group compared to controls or horses treated with fenbendazole. No apparent systemic reactions were observed. Expression of IL-5 and TGF-β in intestinal tissues was significantly lower in Group 3 compared to Group 1. This study revealed a subtle inflammatory reaction to moxidectin, which is unlikely to cause clinical issue.
 gene codes for a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor protein and is reported to be frequently over-expressed in human cancers. Given that c-Myc plays an essential role in neoplastic transformation we wished to define its activity in lung cancer and therefore studied its targeted expression to respiratory epithelium in a transgenic mouse disease model. Using histological well-defined tumors, transcriptome analysis identified novel c-Myc responsive cell cycle and apoptosis genes that were validated as direct c-Myc targets using EMSA, Western blotting, gene reporter and ChIP assays. Through computational analyses c-Myc cooperating transcription factors emerged for repressed and up-regulated genes in cancer samples, namely Klf7, Gata3, Sox18, p53 and Elf5 and Cebpα, respectively. Conversely, at promoters of genes regulated in transgenic but non-carcinomatous lung tissue enriched binding sites for c-Myc, Hbp1, Hif1 were observed. Bioinformatic analysis of tumor transcriptomic data revealed regulatory gene networks and highlighted mortalin and moesin as master regulators while gene reporter and ChIP assays in the H1299 lung cancer cell line as well as cross-examination of published ChIP-sequence data of 7 human and 2 mouse cell lines provided strong evidence for the identified genes to be c-Myc targets. The clinical significance of findings was established by evaluating expression of orthologous proteins in human lung cancer. Taken collectively, a molecular circuit for c-Myc-dependent cellular transformation was identified and the network analysis broadened the perspective for molecularly targeted therapie.
ervical carcinoma secondarily involving the genitourinary tract is rarely documented histologically. These tumors present a unique diagnostic challenge as they can appear morphologically similar to urothelial carcinoma as well as primary squamous cell carcinoma and primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder. Genitourinary consult cases at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1984 to the present were searched for cases in which the differential diagnosis was primary bladder carcinoma versus secondary involvement by cervical carcinoma. We identified 10 cases that met these criteria and evaluated them by immunohistochemistry for p16 and GATA3 and in situ hybridization for human papillomavirus (HPV). Six cases were received with a gynecologic history. Four cases had been misdiagnosed as urothelial carcinoma, and 1 case was favored to be cystitis cystica et glandularis by the submitting institutions. Morphologically, the majority of cases showed basaloid nests of tumor cells infiltrating muscle bundles, with several having foci that mimicked urothelial carcinoma in situ. Six tumors were found to be diffusely positive with p16, 1 tumor was patchy, 1 was weak, and 2 were negative. GATA3 staining was negative in 6 cases, and 4 showed weak to strong positivity. Eight cases were positive for high-risk HPV (6 were positive for HPV 16, and 1 was positive for HPV 18). In the 2 cases that were negative for HPV by in situ hybridization, characteristic morphologic features of HPV-unrelated type of endocervical adenocarcinoma were present. On the basis of our findings we advocate a multifaceted approach, combining morphologic evaluation with ancillary studies including immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in the evaluation of genitourinary specimens for secondary involvement by cervical carcinoma. Furthermore, gynecologic clinical history is absolutely critical and most important to the evaluation and diagnosis of these specimens, as these ancillary studies are not completely sensitive or specifi.
cription factor FOXP3 is essential for the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells (Treg). It is established that the transcription factor GATA-3 is induced in Treg cells under inflammatory conditions. GATA-3 stabilizes FOXP3 levels to avoid the differentiation of Treg cells into inflammatory-like T cells. The IL-6 signal pathway influences the sensitivity of Treg cells towards instability. The mechanism of GATA-3 in regulating FOXP3 and its relation to the IL-6 pathway remains unclear. Here we report how miR-125a-5p plays an important role in regulating the conversion of Treg cells by IL-6. miR-125a-5p expression is low in Treg cells under steady state conditions and can be induced by GATA-3 to inhibit the expression of IL-6R and STAT3. This finding reveals a GATA3/miR-125a-5p/IL-6R and STAT3/FOXP3 regulatory pathway, which determines how Treg cells respond to inflammatory IL-6-rich condition.
luripotent stem cells (iPSCs) undergo extensive nuclear reprogramming and are generally indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in their functional capacity and transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles. However, direct conversion of cells from one lineage to another often yields incompletely reprogrammed, functionally compromised cells, raising the question of whether pluripotency is required to achieve a high degree of nuclear reprogramming. Here, we show that transient expression of Gata3, Eomes, and Tfap2c in mouse fibroblasts induces stable, transgene-independent trophoblast stem-like cells (iTSCs). iTSCs possess transcriptional profiles highly similar to blastocyst-derived TSCs, with comparable methylation and H3K27ac patterns and genome-wide H2A.X deposition. iTSCs generate trophoectodermal lineages upon differentiation, form hemorrhagic lesions, and contribute to developing placentas in chimera assays, indicating a high degree of nuclear reprogramming, with no evidence of passage through a transient pluripotent state. Together, these data demonstrate that extensive nuclear reprogramming can be achieved independently of pluripotenc.
st stem cells (TSCs) arise from the first cell fate decision in the developing embryo and generate extra-embryonic lineages, giving rise to the fetal portion of the placenta. Mouse embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages are strictly separated by a distinct epigenetic barrier, which is not fully overcome following expression of TSC-determining factors in embryonic stem cells. Here, we show that transient expression of Tfap2c, Gata3, Eomes, and Ets2 is sufficient to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts and post-natal tail-tip-derived fibroblasts into induced TSCs (iTSCs) and surmount the epigenetic barrier separating somatic from extra-embryonic lineages. iTSCs share nearly identical morphological characteristics, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation patterns with blastocyst-derived TSCs. Furthermore, iTSCs display transgene-independent self-renewal, differentiate along extra-embryonic lineages, and chimerize host placentas following blastocyst injection. These findings provide insights into the transcription factor networks governing TSC identity and opportunities for studying the epigenetic barriers underlying embryonic and extra-embryonic lineage segregatio.
de association studies and other genetic analyses have identified a large number of genes and variants implicating a variety of disease etiological mechanisms. It is imperative for the study of human diseases to put these genetic findings into a coherent functional context. Here we use system biology tools to examine disease connections of five master genes for CD4+ T cell subtypes (TBX21, GATA3, RORC, BCL6, and FOXP3). We compiled a list of genes functionally interacting (protein-protein interaction, or by acting in the same pathway) with the master genes, then we surveyed the disease connections, either by experimental evidence or by genetic association. Embryonic lethal genes (also known as essential genes) are over-represented in master genes and their interacting genes (55% versus 40% in other genes). Transcription factors are significantly enriched among genes interacting with the master genes (63% versus 10% in other genes). Predicted haploinsufficiency is a feature of most these genes. Disease-connected genes are enriched in this list of genes: 42% of these genes have a disease connection according to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (versus 23% in other genes), and 74% are associated with some diseases or phenotype in a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) (versus 43% in other genes). Seemingly, not all of the diseases connected to genes surveyed were immune related, which may indicate pleiotropic functions of the master regulator genes and associated gene.
isease(GD) is a common autoimmune disorder that is primarily driven by malfunction of T lymphocytes, which influences the production of antibodies reacting with cellular and tissue components of the thyroid gland. The aim of this study was to determine the level of mRNA expression for the genes encoding T-bet and GATA3, as the master regulators of the T helper(Th)1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively together with Th1(IFN-γ) and Th2(IL-4) cytokine mRNA expression. Relative quantification of T-bet, GATA3, IFN-γ and IL-4 transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cell(PBMCs) was conducted by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR(RT-PCR). Serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 were also determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). In comparison with the normal group, T-bet and IFN-γ mRNA expression levels were significantly up-regulated in the GD patients, while GATA3 and IL-4 mRNA expression levels were down-regulated. In addition, a marked decrease in plasma IL-4 levels was observed in the GD group. IFN-γ levels were also higher in patients in comparison to the controls. Furthermore, a clear correlation between increased IFN-γ mRNA expression and IFN-γ (P&lt;0.05) was revealed. These results indicate that a Th1/Th2 imbalance exists in GD, and it may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diseas.
bundance must be precisely regulated throughout life, and nowhere is the stringency of this requirement more evident than during T-cell development: A twofold increase in the abundance of transcription factor GATA3 results in thymic lymphoma, while reduced GATA3 leads to diminished T-cell production. GATA3 haploinsufficiency also causes human HDR (hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal dysplasia) syndrome, often accompanied by immunodeficiency. Here we show that loss of one Gata3 allele leads to diminished expansion (and compromised development) of immature T cells as well as aberrant induction of myeloid transcription factor PU.1. This effect is at least in part mediated transcriptionally: We discovered that Gata3 is monoallelically expressed in a parent of origin-independent manner in hematopoietic stem cells and early T-cell progenitors. Curiously, half of the developing cells switch to biallelic Gata3 transcription abruptly at midthymopoiesis. We show that the monoallelic-to-biallelic transcriptional switch is stably maintained and therefore is not a stochastic phenomenon. This unique mechanism, if adopted by other regulatory genes, may provide new biological insights into the rather prevalent phenomenon of monoallelic expression of autosomal genes as well as into the variably penetrant pathophysiological spectrum of phenotypes observed in many human syndromes that are due to haploinsufficiency of the affected gen.
fy differentially expressed T cells-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and compare their differences in T cell activation and subset functions in different stages of coronary atherosclerosis disease (CAD.
ts with acute myocardial infarction patients (AMI), 20 patients with stable angina pectoris (SA) and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited into the study. Whole human genome microarray analysis was used to detect the expression of T cell related genes among three group.
ession of 68 genes involved in T cell was detected. 1) Antigen recognition: in the AMI patients 12 genes were down-regulated and 9 were significantly down-regulated among all 13 genes, compared with those of the SA and the control group, respectively. 2) Co-stimulators and regulators of T cell activation: among 16 genes in the AMI patients, 15 genes were lower and 8 were significantly lower than the other two groups. 3) T cell subsets, CTL: all 11 genes in the AMI patients were down-regulated, particularly GZMM and CASP8 were significantly down-regulated compared with the SA patients and controls. Th1/Th2: in the AMI patients, gene expressions including IL1 and IL18 were significantly higher, whereas GATA3 mRNA was significantly lower than those in other two groups. Th17/Treg: in the AMI group, RORC and CCR6 mRNAs were significantly down-regulated compared with the control group, while CD25 and CD127 expressions were significantly lower than SA group. There was no difference in T cell related genes between the SA patients and the control.
I patients, the mRNA expression of T cell antigen recognition, activation and subset functions was imbalanced or decreased, indicating the dysfunction of cellular immunity in patients with AMI. Then improving T cell mediated cellular immunity may be considered as a potential target for medical interventions in the patients with AM.
cription factor PU.1 is predominantly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) and is essential for DC differentiation. Although there are several reports that PU.1 positively regulates the expression of DC-specific genes, whether PU.1 also has a suppressive effect on DCs is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that PU.1 suppresses the expression of Th2 cytokines including IL-13 and IL-5 in bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), through repression of the expression of GATA3, which is a master regulator of Th2 differentiations. When PU.1 siRNA was introduced into BMDCs, LPS-induced expression of IL-13 and IL-5 was increased along with upregulation of the constitutive expression of GATA2 and GATA3. The additional introduction of GATA3 siRNA but not of GATA2 siRNA abrogated PU.1 siRNA-mediated upregulation of IL-13 and IL-5. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that PU.1 bound to Gata3 proximal promoter region, which is more dominant than the distal promoter in driving GATA3 transcription in DCs. The degree of histone acetylation at the Gata3 promoter was decreased in PU.1 siRNA-introduced DCs, suggesting the involvement of PU.1 in chromatin modification of the Gata3 promoter. Treatment with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A, increased the degree of histone H3 acetylation at the Gata3 promoter and induced the subsequent expression of GATA3. Experiments using HDAC inhibitors and siRNAs showed that HDAC3 suppressed GATA3 expression. The recruitment of HDAC3 to the Gata3 promoter was decreased by PU.1 knockdown. LPS-induced IL-13 expression was dramatically reduced in BMDCs generated from mice lacking the conserved GATA3 response element, termed CGRE, which is an essential site for the binding of GATA3 on the Il-13 promoter. The degree of H3K4me3 at CGRE was significantly increased in PU.1 siRNA-transfected stimulated DCs. Our results indicate that PU.1 plays pivotal roles in DC development and function, serving not only as a transcriptional activator but also as a represso.
 apical meristem (SAM) is essential for continuous organogenesis in higher plants, while the leaf is the primary source organ and the leaf shape directly affects the efficiency of photosynthesis. HANABA TARANU (HAN) encodes a GATA3-type transcription factor that functions in floral organ development, SAM organization, and embryo development in Arabidopsis, but is involved in suppressing bract outgrowth and promoting branching in grass species. Here the function of the HAN homologue CsHAN1 was characterized in cucumber, an important vegetable with great agricultural and economic value. CsHAN1 is predominantly expressed at the junction of the SAM and the stem, and can partially rescue the han-2 floral organ phenotype in Arabidopsis. Overexpression and RNAi of CsHAN1 transgenic cucumber resulted in retarded growth early after embryogenesis and produced highly lobed leaves. Further, it was found that CsHAN1 may regulate SAM development through regulating the WUSCHEL (WUS) and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) pathways, and mediate leaf development through a complicated gene regulatory network in cucumbe.
 recruitment of cellular mRNAs depends on binding of eIF4F to the mRNA's 5'-terminal 'cap'. The minimal 'cap0' consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5'-5' triphosphate (ppp) bridge. Cap0 is further modified by 2'-O-methylation of the next two riboses, yielding 'cap1' (m7GpppNmN) and 'cap2' (m7GpppNmNm). However, some viral RNAs lack 2'-O-methylation, whereas others contain only ppp- at their 5'-end. Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed effectors of innate immunity that inhibit viral replication by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we investigated the ability of IFIT family members to interact with cap1-, cap0- and 5'ppp- mRNAs and inhibit their translation. IFIT1 and IFIT1B showed very high affinity to cap-proximal regions of cap0-mRNAs (K1/2,app ∼9 to 23 nM). The 2'-O-methylation abrogated IFIT1/mRNA interaction, whereas IFIT1B retained the ability to bind cap1-mRNA, albeit with reduced affinity (K1/2,app ∼450 nM). The 5'-terminal regions of 5'ppp-mRNAs were recognized by IFIT5 (K1/2,app ∼400 nM). The activity of individual IFITs in inhibiting initiation on a specific mRNA was determined by their ability to interact with its 5'-terminal region: IFIT1 and IFIT1B efficiently outcompeted eIF4F and abrogated initiation on cap0-mRNAs, whereas inhibition on cap1- and 5'ppp- mRNAs by IFIT1B and IFIT5 was weaker and required higher protein concentration.
evidence has shown that microRNAs have key roles in regulating various normal physiological processes, whereas their deregulated expression is correlated with various diseases. The miR-146 family includes miR-146a and miR-146b, with a distinct expression spectrum in different hematopoietic cells. Recent work indicated that miR-146a has a close relationship with inflammation and autoimmune diseases. miR-146-deficient mice have developed some abnormal hematopoietic phenotypes, suggesting the potential functions of miR-146 in hematopoietic development. In this study, we found that miR-146b was consistently up-regulated in both K562 and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergoing either erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation. Remarkably, erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation of K562 cells was induced by excess miR-146b but inhibited by decreased miR-146b levels. More importantly, an mRNA encoding receptor tyrosine kinase, namely platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA), was identified and validated as a direct target of miR-146b in hematopoietic cells. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that PDGFRA functioned as a negative regulator in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. miR-146b could ultimately affect the expression of the GATA-1 gene, which is regulated by HEY1 (Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1), a transcriptional repressor, via inhibition of the PDGFRA/JNK/JUN/HEY1 pathway. Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer also demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-146b promoted erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis of HSPCs via its regulation on the PDGFRA gene and effects on GATA-1 expression. Moreover, we confirmed that the binding of GATA-1 to the miR-146b promoter and induction of miR-146b during hematopoietic maturation were dependent on GATA-1. Therefore, miR-146b, PDGFRA, and GATA-1 formed a regulatory circuit to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiatio.
scription factor family members GATA1 and GATA2 play crucial roles in the regulation of lineage-restricted genes during erythroid differentiation. GATA1 is indispensable for survival and terminal differentiation of erythroid, megakaryocytic and eosinophilic progenitors, whereas GATA2 regulates proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Expression levels of GATA1 and GATA2 are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level through auto- and reciprocal regulatory networks formed by these GATA factors. The dynamic and strictly controlled change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has been referred to as GATA factor switching, which plays a crucial role in erythropoiesis. The regulatory network comprising GATA1 and GATA2 gives rise to the stage-specific changes in Gata1 and Gata2 gene expression during erythroid differentiation, which ensures specific expression of early and late erythroid genes at each stage. Recent studies have also shed light on the genome-wide binding profiles of GATA1 and GATA2, and the significance of epigenetic modification of Gata1 gene during erythroid differentiation. This review summarizes the current understanding of network regulation underlying stage-dependent Gata1 and Gata2 gene expressions and the functional contribution of these GATA factors in erythroid differentiatio.
 (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play important roles in normal hematopoiesis, including erythropoiesis. Although studies have identified several miRNAs that regulate erythroid commitment and differentiation, we do not understand the mechanism by which the crucial erythroid transcription factors, GATA-1and NF-E2 directly regulate and control differentiation via miRNA pathways. In this study, we identified miR-199b-5p as a key regulator of human erythropoiesis, and its expression was up-regulated during the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Furthermore, the increase of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells occurred in a GATA-1- and NF-E2-dependent manner during erythrocyte maturation. Both GATA-1 and NF-E2 bound upstream of the miR-199b gene locus and activated its transcription. Forced expression of miRNA-199b-5p in K562 cells affected erythroid cell proliferation and maturation. Moreover, we identified c-Kit as a direct target of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells. Taken together, our results establish a functional link among the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1/NF-E2, miR-199b-5p and c-Kit, and provide new insights into the coupling of transcription and post-transcription regulation in erythroid differentiatio.
criptional regulators of terminal erythropoiesis, such as GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1), have been well characterized, but transcription factors and cofactors and their expression modulations have not yet been explored on a global scale. Here, we use global gene expression analysis to identify 28 transcription factors and 19 transcriptional cofactors induced during terminal erythroid differentiation whose promoters are enriched for binding by GATA1 and TAL1. Utilizing protein-protein interaction databases to identify cofactors for each transcription factor, we pinpoint several co-induced pairs, of which E2f2 and its cofactor transcription factor Dp-2 (Tfdp2) were the most highly induced. TFDP2 is a critical cofactor required for proper cell cycle control and gene expression. GATA1 and TAL1 are bound to the regulatory regions of Tfdp2 and upregulate its expression and knockdown of Tfdp2 results in significantly reduced rates of proliferation as well as reduced upregulation of many erythroid-important genes. Loss of Tfdp2 also globally inhibits the normal downregulation of many E2F2 target genes, including those that regulate the cell cycle, causing cells to accumulate in S phase and resulting in increased erythrocyte size. Our findings highlight the importance of TFDP2 in coupling the erythroid cell cycle with terminal differentiation and validate this study as a resource for future work on elucidating the role of diverse transcription factors and coregulators in erythropoiesi.
n (IFN)-γ is a proinflammatory cytokine that is linked to erythropoiesis inhibition and may contribute to anemia. However, the mechanism of IFN-γ-inhibited erythropoiesis is unknown. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily, induces the erythropoiesis of hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this study, a luciferase reporter assay showed that IFN-γ suppressed activin A-induced ζ-globin promoter activation in K562 erythroblast cells in a dose-dependent manner. Activin A reversed the suppressive effect of IFN-γ on the luciferase activity of ζ-globin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-γ also suppressed the activation of activin A-induced α-globin promoter. IFN-γ reduced the mRNA expression of α-globin, ζ-globin, NF-E2p45, and GATA-1 induced by activin A. The results also showed that IFN-γ induced c-Jun expression when NF-κBp65 and c-Jun bound to two AP-1-binding sites on the c-Jun promoter. The luciferase activity of α-globin and ζ-globin promoters were enhanced by wild-type c-Jun and eliminated by dominant-negative (DN) c-Jun. The suppressive effects of IFN-γ on the mRNA expression of α-globin and ζ-globin were absent in cells expressing DN c-Jun. The ability of NF-E2 to enhance activin A-induced ζ-globin promoter activation decreased when c-Jun was present, and IFN-γ treatment further enhanced the decreasing effect of c-Jun. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that NF-E2p45 bound to the upstream regulatory element (HS-40) of the α-globin gene cluster in response to activin A, whereas c-Jun eliminated this binding. These results suggest that IFN-γ modulates NF-κB/c-Jun to antagonize activin A-mediated NF-E2 transcriptional activity on globin gene expressio.
on of the genetic pathways that control red blood cell development has been a central goal of erythropoiesis research over the past decade. Notably, data from several recent studies have provided new insights into the regulation of erythroid gene transcription. Transcription profiling demonstrates that erythropoiesis is mainly controlled by a small group of lineage-restricted transcription factors [Gata binding protein 1 (Gata1), T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 protein (Tal1), and Erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF; henceforth referred to as Klf1)]. Binding-site mapping using ChIP-Seq indicates that most DNA-bound Gata1 and Tal1 proteins are contained within higher order complexes (Ldb1 complexes) that include the nuclear adapters Ldb1 and Lmo2. Ldb1 complexes regulate Klf1, and Ldb1 complex-binding sites frequently colocalize with Klf1 at erythroid genes and cis-regulatory elements, indicating strong functional synergy between Gata1, Tal1, and Klf1. Together with new data demonstrating that Ldb1 can mediate long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, these findings provide a foundation for the first comprehensive models of the global regulation of erythroid gene transcriptio.
he paradigmatic GATA-PU.1 axis to explore, at the systems level, dynamic relationships between transcription factor (TF) binding and global gene expression programs as multipotent cells differentiate. We combined global ChIP-seq of GATA1, GATA2, and PU.1 with expression profiling during differentiation to erythroid and neutrophil lineages. Our analysis reveals (1) differential complexity of sequence motifs bound by GATA1, GATA2, and PU.1; (2) the scope and interplay of GATA1 and GATA2 programs within, and during transitions between, different cell compartments, and the extent of their hard-wiring by DNA motifs; (3) the potential to predict gene expression trajectories based on global associations between TF-binding data and target gene expression; and (4) how dynamic modeling of DNA-binding and gene expression data can be used to infer regulatory logic of TF circuitry. This rubric exemplifies the utility of this cross-platform resource for deconvoluting the complexity of transcriptional programs controlling stem/progenitor cell fate in hematopoiesi.
cription factor GATA1 is essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic cell differentiation. Gata1 hematopoietic regulatory domain (G1HRD) has been shown to recapitulate endogenous Gata1 gene expression in transgenic mouse assays in vivo. G1HRD contains a promoter-proximal enhancer composed of a GATA-palindrome motif, four CP2-binding sites and two CACCC boxes. We prepared transgenic reporter mouse lines in which green fluorescent protein and β-galactosidase expression are driven by wild-type G1HRD (as a positive control) and the G1HRD harboring mutations within these cis-acting elements (as the experimental conditions), respectively. Exploiting this transgenic dual reporter (TDR) assay, we show here that in definitive erythropoiesis, G1HRD activity was markedly affected by individual mutations in the GATA-palindrome motif and the CACCC boxes. Mutation of CP2-binding sites also moderately decreased G1HRD activity. The combined mutation of the CP2-binding sites and the GATA-palindrome motif resulted in complete loss of G1HRD activity. In contrast, in primitive erythroid cells, individual mutations of each element did not affect G1HRD activity; G1HRD activity was abolished only when these three mutations were combined. These results thus show that all three elements independently and cooperatively contribute to G1HRD activity in vivo in definitive erythropoiesis, although these are contributing redundantly to primitive erythropoiesi.
a master regulator of hematopoietic differentiation, but Gata1 expression is inactivated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Using a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the Gata1 gene modified with green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter, we explored the function of the 3.7-kb Gata1 upstream region (GdC region) that harbors 3 core cis-elements: Gata1 hematopoietic enhancer, double GATA-motif, and CACCC-motif. Transgenic GFP expression directed by the Gata1-BAC faithfully recapitulated the endogenous Gata1 expression pattern. However, deletion of the GdC-region eliminated reporter expression in all hematopoietic cells. To test whether the combination of the core cis-elements represents the regulatory function of the GdC-region, we replaced the region with a 659-bp minigene that linked the three cis-elements (MG-GFP). The GFP reporter expression directed by the MG-GFP BAC fully recapitulated the erythroid-megakaryocytic Gata1 expression. However, the GFP expression was aberrantly increased in the HSCs and was associated with decreases in DNA methylation and abundant GATA2 binding to the transgenic MG-GFP allele. The 3.2-kb sequences interspaced between the Gata1 hematopoietic enhancer and the double GATA-motif were able to recruit DNA methyltransferase 1, thereby exerting a cis-repressive function in the HSC-like cell line. These results indicate that the 3.2-kb interspacing sequences inactivate Gata1 by maintaining DNA-methylation in the HSC.
se physiologic demand to generate vast numbers of red blood cells requires the establishment of a complex genetic network by the master regulatory transcription factor GATA-1 and its coregulators. This network dictates the genesis of enucleated erythrocytes by orchestrating the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells. In addition to the crucial GATA-1 coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), a component of the Mediator complex, Med1, facilitates GATA-1-dependent transcription at select target genes and controls erythropoiesis. It is not known to what extent Med1 contributes to GATA-1 function or whether Med1 controls a large or restricted cohort of genes that are not regulated by GATA-1. Using a genetic complementation assay in GATA-1-null erythroid cells, we demonstrate that Med1 and another Mediator component, Med25, regulate a restricted cohort of genes that are predominantly not controlled by GATA-1. Most of these genes were not regulated by Med1 in fibroblasts. Loss-of-function analyses with GATA-1-independent Med1 target genes indicate that Rrad, which encodes a small GTPase induced during human erythropoiesis, conferred erythroid cell survival. Thus, while Med1 is a context-dependent GATA-1 coregulator, it also exerts specialized functions in erythroid cells to control GATA-1-independent, cell-type-specific genes, which include candidate regulators of erythroid cell development and functio.
lastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by dyserythropoiesis resulting in anemia. This pathological hallmark is incompletely understood. Notch signaling has been linked to impaired erythropoietic and megakaryopoietic development of CD34+ progenitor cells, but its role in MDS is unclear. We have analyzed the transcriptional activity of Notch pathway elements and its association with the key erythroid factor globin transcription factor 1 (GATA1) and the apoptosis regulatory gene B-cell lymphoma-xl (BCLxl) in MDS. The methylation of GATA1 erythroid promoter CpG dinucleotides flanking cis-regulatory elements, including an N-box suppressor binding site for HES1 and a GATA-box binding site, was examined in normal and MDS erythropoiesis. We have generated a kinetic in vitro model of MDS erythropoiesis using CD34+ bone marrow cells from healthy donors (n = 7) and patients with MDS (low risk: RA/n = 6, RARS/n = 3; high risk: RAEB/n = 4, RAEB-T/n = 2). RNA expression of GATA1, BCLxl, DLK1, Notch1, HES1, and HERP2 was measured by real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). DNA methylation at seven CpG dinucleotides of the GATA1 gene promoter was quantitatively analyzed by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA at any specific time point. For the Notch pathway elements, no conclusive expression differences were found between MDS and normal erythropoiesis. But we found steadily up-regulated RNA expression of GATA1 and of BCLxl during late normal erythropoietic differentiation. In contrast, during MDS, erythropoiesis a loss of typical up-regulation of GATA1 and BCLxl was observed. Hypermethylation of CpG dinucleotides flanking the repressor HES1 binding site within the 5' region of GATA1 was detected particularly during late MDS erythropoiesis. Interestingly, decremental GATA1 promotor methylation values were seen during normal erythropoiesis matching GATA1 RNA up-regulation. Our data show that the critical erythropoietic transcription factor GATA1 as well as the antiapoptotic molecule BCLxl fails to be normally up-regulated during MDS erythropoiesis. The higher residual 5'-GATA1 methylation values in MDS erythropoiesis but decremental loss thereof in normal erythropoiesis suggest a gene dose effect for GATA1 during erythropoiesis being finely tuned by CpG methylation. Its dysregulation may contribute to the ineffective erythropoiesis observed in MD.
n 1 (Mfrn1; Slc25a37) and mitoferrin 2 (Mfrn2; Slc25a28) function as essential mitochondrial iron importers for heme and Fe/S cluster biogenesis. A genetic deficiency of Mfrn1 results in a profound hypochromic anemia in vertebrate species. To map the cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that control expression of the Mfrn genes, we utilized genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) datasets for the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. We identified the CRMs that faithfully drive the expression of Mfrn1 during blood and heart development and Mfrn2 ubiquitously. Through in vivo analyses of the Mfrn-CRMs in zebrafish and mouse, we demonstrate their functional and evolutionary conservation. Using knockdowns with morpholinos and cell sorting analysis in transgenic zebrafish embryos, we show that GATA-1 directly regulates the expression of Mfrn1. Mutagenesis of individual GATA-1 binding cis elements (GBE) demonstrated that at least two of the three GBE within this CRM are functionally required for GATA-mediated transcription of Mfrn1. Furthermore, ChIP assays demonstrate switching from GATA-2 to GATA-1 at these elements during erythroid maturation. Our results provide new insights into the genetic regulation of mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis and, more generally, illustrate the utility of genome-wide ChIP analysis combined with zebrafish transgenesis for identifying long-range transcriptional enhancers that regulate tissue developmen.
ntal control mechanisms often use multimeric complexes containing transcription factors, coregulators, and additional non-DNA binding components. It is challenging to ascertain how such components contribute to complex function at endogenous loci. We analyzed the function of components of a complex containing master regulators of hematopoiesis (GATA-1 and Scl/TAL1) and the non-DNA binding components ETO2, the LIM domain protein LMO2, and the chromatin looping factor LDB1. Surprisingly, we discovered that ETO2 and LMO2 regulate distinct target-gene ensembles in erythroid cells. ETO2 commonly repressed GATA-1 function via suppressing histone H3 acetylation, although it also regulated methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 at select loci. Prior studies defined multiple modes by which GATA-1 regulates target genes with or without the coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1). LMO2 selectively repressed genes that GATA-1 represses in a FOG-1-independent manner. As LMO2 controls hematopoiesis, its dysregulation is leukemogenic, and its influence on GATA factor function is unknown, this mechanistic link has important biological and pathophysiological implications. The demonstration that ETO2 and LMO2 exert qualitatively distinct functions at endogenous loci illustrates how components of complexes containing master developmental regulators can impart the capacity to regulate unique cohorts of target genes, thereby diversifying complex functio.
pendent transcription is essential for erythroid differentiation and maturation. Suppression of programmed cell death is also thought to be critical for this process; however, the link between these two features of erythropoiesis has remained elusive. Here, we show that the POZ-Krüppel family transcription factor, LRF (also known as Zbtb7a/Pokemon), is a direct target of GATA1 and plays an essential antiapoptotic role during terminal erythroid differentiation. We find that loss of Lrf leads to lethal anemia in embryos, due to increased apoptosis of late-stage erythroblasts. This programmed cell death is Arf and p53 independent and is instead mediated by upregulation of the proapoptotic factor Bim. We identify Lrf as a direct repressor of Bim transcription. In strong support of this mechanism, genetic Bim loss delays the lethality of Lrf-deficient embryos and rescues their anemia phenotype. Thus, our data define a key transcriptional cascade for effective erythropoiesis, whereby GATA-1 suppresses BIM-mediated apoptosis via LR.
etic transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 bind each other on DNA to block transcriptional programs of undesired lineage during hematopoietic commitment. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells that coexpress GATA-1 and PU.1 are blocked at the blast stage but respond to molecular removal (downregulation) of PU.1 or addition (upregulation) of GATA-1 by inducing terminal erythroid differentiation. To test whether GATA-1 blocks PU.1 in MEL cells, we have conditionally activated a transgenic PU.1 protein fused with the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (PUER), resulting in activation of a myeloid transcriptional program. Gene expression arrays identified components of the PU.1-dependent transcriptome negatively regulated by GATA-1 in MEL cells, including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (Cebpa) and core-binding factor, beta subunit (Cbfb), which encode two key hematopoietic transcription factors. Inhibition of GATA-1 by small interfering RNA resulted in derepression of PU.1 target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays identified PU.1 motif sequences near Cebpa and Cbfb that are co-occupied by PU.1 and GATA-1 in the leukemic blasts. Significant derepression of Cebpa and Cbfb is achieved in MEL cells by either activation of PU.1 or knockdown of GATA-1. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of these loci by manipulating the levels of PU.1 and GATA-1 involves quantitative increases in a transcriptionally active chromatin mark: acetylation of histone H3K9. Collectively, we show that either activation of PU.1 or inhibition of GATA-1 efficiently reverses the transcriptional block imposed by GATA-1 and leads to the activation of a myeloid transcriptional program directed by PU..
ar protein FOG-1 binds transcription factor GATA-1 to facilitate erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation. However, little is known about the function of FOG-1 during myeloid and lymphoid development or how FOG-1 expression is regulated in any tissue. We used in situ hybridization, gain- and loss-of-function studies in zebrafish to address these problems. Zebrafish FOG-1 is expressed in early hematopoietic cells, as well as heart, viscera, and paraspinal neurons, suggesting that it has multifaceted functions in organogenesis. We found that FOG-1 is dispensable for endoderm specification but is required for endoderm patterning affecting the expression of late-stage T-cell markers, independent of GATA-1. The suppression of FOG-1, in the presence of normal GATA-1 levels, induces severe anemia and thrombocytopenia and expands myeloid-progenitor cells, indicating that FOG-1 is required during erythroid/myeloid commitment. To functionally interrogate whether GATA-1 regulates FOG-1 in vivo, we used bioinformatics combined with transgenic assays. Thus, we identified 2 cis-regulatory elements that control the tissue-specific gene expression of FOG-1. One of these enhancers contains functional GATA-binding sites, indicating the potential for a regulatory loop in which GATA factors control the expression of their partner protein FOG-.
 a lineage-restricted transcription factor that plays essential roles in hematopoietic development. The Gata1 gene hematopoietic enhancer allowed Gata1 reporter expression in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes of transgenic mice. The Gata1 hematopoietic enhancer activity is strictly dependent on a GATA site located in the 5' region of the enhancer. However, the importance of the GC-rich region adjacent to the 3'-end of this GATA site has been also suggested. In this study, we show that this GC-rich region contains five contiguous deoxyguanosine residues (G(5) string) that are bound by multiple nuclear proteins. Interestingly, deletion of one deoxyguanosine residue from the G(5) string (G(4) mutant) specifically eliminates binding to ZBP-89, a Krüppel-like transcription factor, but not to Sp3 and other binding factors. We demonstrate that GATA-1 and ZBP-89 occupy chromatin regions of the Gata1 enhancer and physically associate in vitro through zinc finger domains. Gel mobility shift assays and DNA affinity precipitation assays suggest that binding of ZBP-89 to this region is reduced in the absence of GATA-1 binding to the G1HE. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that ZBP-89 activates the Gata1 enhancer depending on the G(5) string sequence. Finally, transgenic mouse studies reveal that the G(4) mutation significantly reduced the reporter activity of the Gata1 hematopoietic regulatory domain encompassing an 8.5-kbp region of the Gata1 gene. These data provide compelling evidence that the G(5) string is necessary for Gata1 gene expression in vivo and ZBP-89 is the functional trans-acting factor for this cis-acting regio.
tion factors originally identified as drivers of erythroid differentiation subsequently became linked to megakaryopoiesis, reflecting the shared parentage of red cells and platelets. The divergent development of megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors relies on signaling pathways that impose lineage-specific transcriptional programs on non-lineage-restricted protein complexes. One such signaling pathway involves RUNX1, a transcription factor upregulated in megakaryocytes and downregulated in erythroid cells. In this pathway, RUNX1 engages the erythro-megakaryocytic master regulator GATA-1 in a megakaryocytic transcriptional complex whose activity is highly dependent on the P-TEFb kinase complex. The implications of this pathway for normal and pathological megakaryopoiesis are discusse.
etic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining gene.
 from different regions of the genome frequently forms steady associations that play important roles in regulating gene expression. The widely used chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay allows determination of the in vivo structural organization of an active endogenous locus. However, unpredicted chromatin associations within a given genomic locus can not be identified by 3C. Here, we describe a new strategy, quantitative associated chromatin trap (QACT), which incorporates a modified 3C method and a quantitative assay tool, to capture and quantitatively analyzes all possible associated chromatin partners (ACPs) of a given chromatin fragment. Using QACT, we have analyzed the chromatin conformation of the mouse alpha-globin gene cluster and proved the extensive interaction between HS26 and alpha-globin genes. In addition, we have identified a candidate alpha1-globin gene specific silencer 475A8 which shows the differentiation-stage specific DNase I hypersensitivity. Functional analysis suggests that 475A8 may regulate the alpha1-globin gene during terminal differentiation of committed erythroid progenitor cells. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and cotransfection assays demonstrate that GATA-1, a hemopoietic specific transcriptional factor, may increase alpha1-globin gene expression by suppressing the function of 475A8 in terminally differentiated erythroid cell.
 is a process that leads to the degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components and long-lived protein aggregates. Erythropoiesis is a branch of hematopoietic differentiation by which mature red blood cells (RBCs) are generated from multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Autophagy plays a critical role in the elimination of mitochondria, ribosomes and other organelles during erythroid terminal differentiation. Here, the modulators of autophagy that regulate erythroid differentiation were summarized, including autophagy-related (Atg) genes, the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3-like (Nix/Binp3L), transcription factors globin transcription factor 1 (GATA1) and forkhead box O3 (FoxO3), intermediary factor KRAB-associated protein1 (KAP1), and other modulators, such as focal adhesion kinase family-interacting protein of 200-kDa (FIP200), Ca2+ and 15-lipoxygenase. Understanding the modulators of autophagy in erythropoiesis will benefit the autophagy research field and facilitate the prevention and treatment of autophagy-related red blood cell disorder.
ctor independence 1 (Gfi-1) is a part of the transcriptional network that regulates the development of adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Gfi-1-null (Gfi-1(-/-)) mice have reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), impaired radioprotective function of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), and myeloid and erythroid hyperplasia. We found that the development of HPCs and erythropoiesis, but not HSC function, was rescued by reducing the expression of inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 2 (Id2) in Gfi-1(-/-) mice. Analysis of Gfi-1(-/-);Id2(+/-) mice revealed that short-term HSCs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), erythroid burst-forming units, colony-forming units in spleen, and more differentiated red cells were partially restored by reducing Id2 levels in Gfi-1(-/-) mice. Moreover, short-term reconstituting cells, and, to a greater extent, CMP and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor development, and red blood cell production (anemia) were rescued in mice transplanted with Gfi-1(-/-);Id2(+/-) bone marrow cells (BMCs) in comparison with Gfi-1(-/-) BMCs. Reduction of Id2 expression in Gfi-1(-/-) mice increased the expression of Gata1, Eklf, and EpoR, which are required for proper erythropoiesis. Reducing the levels of other Id family members (Id1 and Id3) in Gfi-1(-/-) mice did not rescue impaired HPC function or erythropoiesis. These data provide new evidence that Gfi-1 is linked to the erythroid gene regulatory network by repressing Id2 expressio.
ted differentiation toward erythroid (E) or megakaryocytic (MK) lineages by the MK-E progenitor (MEP) could enhance the ex vivo generation of red blood cells and platelets for therapeutic transfusions. The lineage choice at the MEP bifurcation is controlled in large part by activity within the intracellular signal transduction network, the output of which determines the activity of transcription factors (TFs) and ultimately gene expression. Although many TFs have been implicated, E or MK differentiation is a complex process requiring multiple days, and the dynamics of TF activities during commitment and terminal maturation are relatively unexplored. Herein, we applied a living cell array for the large-scale, dynamic quantification of TF activities during MEP bifurcation. A panel of hematopoietic TFs (GATA-1, GATA-2, SCL/TAL1, FLI-1, NF-E2, PU.1, c-Myb) was characterized during E and MK differentiation of bipotent K562 cells. Dynamic TF activity profiles associated with differentiation towards each lineage were identified, and validated with previous reports. From these activity profiles, we show that GATA-1 is an important hub during early hemin- and PMA-induced differentiation, and reveal several characteristic TF interactions for E and MK differentiation that confirm regulatory mechanisms documented in the literature. Additionally, we highlight several novel TF interactions at various stages of E and MK differentiation. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism by which nicotinamide (NIC) promoted terminal MK maturation using an MK-committed cell line, CHRF-288-11 (CHRF). Concomitant with its enhancement of ploidy, NIC strongly enhanced the activity of three TFs with known involvement in terminal MK maturation: FLI-1, NF-E2, and p53. Dynamic profiling of TF activity represents a novel tool to complement traditional assays focused on mRNA and protein expression levels to understand progenitor cell differentiatio.
subunit of the Mediator transcriptional coregulator complex coactivates GATA1 and induces erythropoiesis. Here, we show the dual mechanism of GATA1- and MED1-mediated transcription. MED1 expression levels in K562 erythroleukemia cells paralleled the levels of GATA1-targeted gene transcription and erythroid differentiation. An N-terminal fragment of MED1, MED1(1-602), which is incapable of interacting with GATA1, enhanced GATA1-targeted gene transcription and erythroid differentiation, and introduction of MED1(1-602) into Med1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) partially rescued GATA1-mediated transcription. The C-terminal zinc-finger domain of GATA1 interacts with the MED1(1-602)-interacting coactivator CCAR1, CoCoA and MED1(681-715). CCAR1 and CoCoA synergistically enhanced GATA1-mediated transcription from the γ-globin promoter in MEFs. Recombinant GATA1, CCAR1, CoCoA and MED1(1-602) formed a complex in vitro, and GATA1, CCAR1, CoCoA and MED1 were recruited to the γ-globin promoter in K562 cells during erythroid differentiation. Therefore, in addition to the direct interaction between GATA1 and MED1, CoCoA and CCAR1 appear to relay the GATA1 signal to MED1, and multiple modes of the GATA1-MED1 axis may help to fine-tune GATA1 function during GATA1-mediated homeostasis event.
iesis is regulated at multiple levels to ensure the proper generation of mature red cells under multiple physiological conditions. To probe the contribution of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to this process, we examined &gt;1 billion RNA-seq reads of polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNA from differentiating mouse fetal liver red blood cells and identified 655 lncRNA genes including not only intergenic, antisense, and intronic but also pseudogene and enhancer loci. More than 100 of these genes are previously unrecognized and highly erythroid specific. By integrating genome-wide surveys of chromatin states, transcription factor occupancy, and tissue expression patterns, we identify multiple lncRNAs that are dynamically expressed during erythropoiesis, show epigenetic regulation, and are targeted by key erythroid transcription factors GATA1, TAL1, or KLF1. We focus on 12 such candidates and find that they are nuclear-localized and exhibit complex developmental expression patterns. Depleting them severely impaired erythrocyte maturation, inhibiting cell size reduction and subsequent enucleation. One of them, alncRNA-EC7, is transcribed from an enhancer and is specifically needed for activation of the neighboring gene encoding BAND 3. Our study provides an annotated catalog of erythroid lncRNAs, readily available through an online resource, and shows that diverse types of lncRNAs participate in the regulatory circuitry underlying erythropoiesi.
tional networks orchestrate complex developmental processes, and such networks are commonly instigated by master regulators for development. By now, considerable progress has been made in elucidating GATA factor-dependent genetic networks that control red blood cell development. Here we reported that GATA-1 and GATA-2 co-regulated the expression of two microRNA genes, microRNA-27a and microRNA-24, with critical roles in regulating erythroid differentiation. In general, GATA-2 occupied the miR-27a≈24 promoter and repressed their transcription in immature erythroid progenitor cells. As erythropoiesis proceeded, GATA-1 directly activated miR-27a≈24 transcription, and this involved a GATA-1-mediated displacement of GATA-2 from chromatin, a process termed 'GATA switch'. Furthermore, the mature miR-27a and miR-24 cooperatively inhibited GATA-2 translation and favoured the occupancy switch from GATA-2 to GATA-1, thus completing a positive feedback loop to promote erythroid maturation. In line with the essential role of GATA factors, ectopic expression of miR-27a or miR-24 promoted erythropoiesis in human primary CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells and mice, whereas attenuated miR-27 or miR-24 level led to impaired erythroid phenotypes in haematopoietic progenitor cells and zebrafish. Taken together, these data integrated micro RNA expression and function into GATA factor coordinated networks and provided mechanistic insight into a regulatory circuit that comprised GATA1/2 switch and miR-27a/24 in erythropoiesi.
lishment and maintenance of cell type-specific transcriptional programs require an ensemble of broadly expressed chromatin remodeling and modifying enzymes. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the contributions of these enzymes to specialized genetic networks that control critical processes, such as lineage commitment and cellular differentiation. We have been addressing this problem in the context of erythrocyte development driven by the transcription factor GATA-1 and its coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1). As certain GATA-1 target genes have little to no FOG-1 requirement for expression, presumably additional coregulators can mediate GATA-1 function. Using a genetic complementation assay and RNA interference in GATA-1-null cells, we demonstrate a vital link between GATA-1 and the histone H4 lysine 20 methyltransferase PR-Set7/SetD8 (SetD8). GATA-1 selectively induced H4 monomethylated lysine 20 at repressed, but not activated, loci, and endogenous SetD8 mediated GATA-1-dependent repression of a cohort of its target genes. GATA-1 used different combinations of SetD8, FOG-1, and the FOG-1-interacting nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex component Mi2β to repress distinct target genes. Implicating SetD8 as a context-dependent GATA-1 corepressor expands the repertoire of coregulators mediating establishment/maintenance of the erythroid cell genetic network, and provides a biological framework for dissecting the cell type-specific functions of this important coregulator. We propose a coregulator matrix model in which distinct combinations of chromatin regulators are required at different GATA-1 target genes, and the unique attributes of the target loci mandate these combination.
iation of hematopoietic stem cells to red cells requires coordinated expression of numerous erythroid genes and is characterized by nuclear condensation and extrusion during terminal development. To understand the regulatory mechanisms governing these widespread phenotypic changes, we conducted a high resolution methylomic and transcriptomic analysis of six major stages of human erythroid differentiation. We observed widespread epigenetic differences between early and late stages of erythropoiesis with progressive loss of methylation being the dominant change during differentiation. Gene bodies, intergenic regions, and CpG shores were preferentially demethylated during erythropoiesis. Epigenetic changes at transcription factor binding sites correlated significantly with changes in gene expression and were enriched for binding motifs for SCL, MYB, GATA, and other factors not previously implicated in erythropoiesis. Demethylation at gene promoters was associated with increased expression of genes, whereas epigenetic changes at gene bodies correlated inversely with gene expression. Important gene networks encoding erythrocyte membrane proteins, surface receptors, and heme synthesis proteins were found to be regulated by DNA methylation. Furthermore, integrative analysis enabled us to identify novel, potential regulatory areas of the genome as evident by epigenetic changes in a predicted PU.1 binding site in intron 1 of the GATA1 gene. This intronic site was found to be conserved across species and was validated to be a novel PU.1 binding site by quantitative ChIP in erythroid cells. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of methylomic and transcriptomic changes during erythroid differentiation and demonstrates that human terminal erythropoiesis is surprisingly associated with hypomethylation of the genom.
ignal peptide-CUB (complement protein C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1)-EGF domain-containing protein 1), the founding member of a novel secreted and cell surface SCUBE protein family, is expressed predominantly in various developing tissues in mice. However, its function in primitive hematopoiesis remains unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized zebrafish scube1 and analyzed its function by injecting antisense morpholino-oligonucleotide into embryos. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that zebrafish scube1 mRNA is maternally expressed and widely distributed during early embryonic development. Knockdown of scube1 by morpholino-oligonucleotide down-regulated the expression of marker genes associated with early primitive hematopoietic precursors (scl) and erythroid (gata1 and hbbe1), as well as early (pu.1) and late (mpo and l-plastin) myelomonocytic lineages. However, the expression of an early endothelial marker fli1a and vascular morphogenesis appeared normal in scube1 morphants. Overexpression of bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) rescued the expression of scl in the posterior lateral mesoderm during early primitive hematopoiesis in scube1 morphants. Biochemical and molecular analysis revealed that Scube1 could be a BMP co-receptor to augment BMP signaling. Our results suggest that scube1 is critical for and functions at the top of the regulatory hierarchy of primitive hematopoiesis by modulating BMP activity during zebrafish embryogenesi.
anhydrase 1 (Car1), an early specific marker of the erythroid differentiation, has been used to distinguish fetal and adult erythroid cells since its production closely follows the γ- to β-globin transition, but the molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of Car1 is unclear. Here, we show that Car1 mRNA decreases significantly when erythroid differentiation is induced in MEL cells. The Ldb1 protein complex including GATA1/SCL/LMO2 binds to the Car1 promoter in uninduced cells and reduced enrichment of the complex during differentiation correlates with loss of Car1 expression. Knockdown of Ldb1 results in a reduction of Ser2 phosphorylated RNA Pol II and Cdk9 at the Car1 promoter region, suggesting that Ldb1 is required for recruitment of Pol II as well as the transcription regulator P-TEFb to enhance elongation of Car1 transcripts. Taken together, these data show that Ldb1 forms a regulatory complex to maintain Car1 expression in erythroid cell.
e the differentiation-inducing properties of the novel erythroid differentiation related gene EDRF1, and demonstrate its functioning pathway involved in regulation of alpha- and gamma-globin gene expressio.
se and antisense constructs were transfected into HEL cells, then the expression of globin and erythropoietin receptor gene was identified by Northern blot analysis. RT-PCR and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) were carried out to monitor the expression and DNA-binding activity of erythroid specific transcription factor GATA-1 and NF-E.
lls with transfection of sense expression carrier, the experssion of EDRF1 mRNA was upregulated. In HEL cells with transfection of antisense expression carrier, the experession of EDRF1 mRNA was downregulated. In HEL cells with overexpression of EDRF1, production of alpha-globin was increased. In antisense EDRF1 overexpressed HEL cells, significant loss of alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA synthesis was observed. The expression of erythropoietin receptor was unchanged in HEL cells transfected with EDRF1 sense and antisense expression carriers. No significant change was found in expression of transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 in HEL cells transfected with empty carrier, sense expression carrier, and antisense expression carrier. However, the transcription activity of GATA-1 was severely impaired. Expression of erythropoietin receptor gene was not influenced by EDRF1 gene overexpressio.
ulates alpha- and gamma-globin gene synthesis by modulating DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 transcription factor. Overexpression and underexpression of EDRF1 do not significantly regulate the expression of GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA. Monitoring the EPOR signal pathway is not the mechanism by which EDRF1 influences the differentiation of erythrocyt.
r characterize the differentiation inducing properties of EDRF1 and demonstrate its functional pathway involved in regulation of globin gene expressio.
ecting EDRF1 sense and antisense constructs into HEL cells, we identified the expression of globin and erythropoietin receptor genes by Northern blot analysis. RT-PCR and EMSA (electrophoresis mobility shift assay) were performed to monitor the expression and DNA-binding activity of erythroid specific transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E.
own that when EDRF1 was overexpressed, production of alpha-globin increased. In antisense EDRF1, overexpression of HEL cells, significant loss of alpha-, gamma-globin mRNA synthesis was observed. The transcription of endogenous GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA expression were maintained at the same levels compared with control experiments. However, the transcription activity of GATA-1 was severely impaired. Expression of erythropoietin receptor gene was not influenced by EDRF1 gene overexpressio.
ts suggested that EDRF1 regulated alpha- and gamma-globin gene synthesis by modulating DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 transcription facto.
f an extra copy of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, Down syndrome (DS) individuals develop high levels of Aβ peptides and Alzheimer's disease-like brain amyloidosis early in life. Here we show that the γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP), a key enzyme in amyloidogenesis, is increased in DS brains and specifically regulated at the transcriptional level by GATA1 transcription factor. The discovery of this novel pathway has translational implications for DS since pharmacological inhibition of GSAP is an attractive and viable Aβ lowering therapeutic strategy for this disorder.

 connection between ribosome biogenesis dysfunction and specific hematopoiesis-related disorders prompted us to examine the role of critical lineage-specific transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of ribosomal protein (RP) genes during terminal erythroid differentiation. By applying EMSA and ChIP methodologies in mouse erythroleukemia cells we show that GATA1 and PU.1 bind in vitro and in vivo the proximal promoter region of the RPS19 gene which is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia. Moreover, ChIPseq data analysis also demonstrates that several RP genes are enriched as potential GATA1 and PU.1 gene targets in mouse and human erythroid cells, with GATA1 binding showing an association with higher ribosomal protein gene expression levels during terminal erythroid differentiation in human and mouse. Our results suggest that RP gene expression and hence balanced ribosome biosynthesis may be specifically and selectively regulated by lineage specific transcription factors during hematopoiesis, a finding which may be clinically relevant to ribosomopathie.
aly is a major manifestation of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) contributing to clinical symptoms and hematologic abnormalities. The spleen from PMF patients contains increased numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and megakaryocytes. These megakaryocytes express high levels of P-selectin (P-sel) that, by triggering neutrophil emperipolesis, may cause TGF-β release and disease progression. This hypothesis was tested by deleting the P-sel gene in the myelofibrosis mouse model carrying the hypomorphic Gata1(low) mutation that induces megakaryocyte abnormalities that recapitulate those observed in PMF. P-sel(null) Gata1(low) mice survived splenectomy and lived three months longer than P-sel(WT) Gata1(low) littermates and expressed limited fibrosis and osteosclerosis in the marrow or splenomegaly. Furthermore, deletion of P-sel disrupted megakaryocyte/neutrophil interactions in spleen, reduced TGF-β content and corrected the HSC distribution that in Gata1(low) mice, as in PMF patients, is abnormally expanded in spleen. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β reduced P-sel expression in megakaryocytes and corrected HSC distribution. Spleens, but not marrow, of Gata1(low) mice contained numerous cKIT(pos) activated fibrocytes, probably of dendritic cell origin, whose membrane protrusions interacted with megakaryocytes establishing niches hosting immature cKIT(pos) hematopoietic cells. These activated fibrocytes were not detected in spleens from P-sel(null) Gata1(low) or TGF-β-inhibited Gata1(low) littermates and were observed in spleen, but not in marrow, from PMF patients. Therefore in Gata1(low) mice, and possibly in PMF, abnormal P-sel expression in megakaryocytes may mediate the pathological cell interactions that increase TGF-β content in MK and favor establishment of a microenvironment that supports myelofibrosis-related HSC in spleen.

fish (Danio rerio) is a very popular vertebrate model system, especially embryos represent a valuable tool for in vivo pharmacological assays. This is mainly due to the zebrafish advantages when compared to other animal models. Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone that acts principally on erythroid progenitors, stimulating their survival, proliferation and differentiation. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been widely used in medicine to treat anemia and it is one of the best-selling biotherapeutics worldwide. The recombinant molecule, industrially produced in CHO cells, has the same amino acid sequence of endogenous human erythropoietin, but differs in the glycosylation pattern. This may influence efficacy and safety, particularly immunogenicity, of the final product. We employed the zebrafish embryo as a vertebrate animal model to perform in vivo pharmacological assays. We conducted a functional analysis of rhEPO alpha Eprex(®) and two biosimilars, the erythropoietin alpha Binocrit(®) and zeta Retacrit(®). By in silico analysis and 3D modeling we proved the interaction between recombinant human erythropoietin and zebrafish endogenous erythropoietin receptor. Then we treated zebrafish embryos with the 3 rhEPOs and we investigated their effect on erythrocytes production with different assays. By real time-PCR we observed the relative upregulation of gata1 (2.4±0.3 fold), embryonic α-Hb (1.9±0.2 fold) and β-Hb (1.6±0.1 fold) transcripts. A significant increase in Stat5 phosphorylation was also assessed in embryos treated with rhEPOs when compared with the negative controls. Live imaging in tg (kdrl:EGFP; gata1:ds-red) embryos, o-dianisidine positive area quantification and cyanomethemoglobin content quantification revealed a 1.8±0.3 fold increase of erythrocytes amount in embryos treated with rhEPOs when compared with the negative controls. Finally, we verified that recombinant human erythropoietins did not cause any inflammatory response in the treated embryos. Our data showed that zebrafish embryo can be a valuable tool to study in vivo effects of complex pharmacological compounds, such as recombinant human glycoproteins, allowing to perform fast and reproducible pharmacological assays with excellent result.
ation of blood cellular components from hematopoietic stem cells is important for the therapy of a broad spectrum of hematological disorders. In recent years, several lines of evidence suggested that certain nutrients, vitamins and flavonoids may have important roles in controlling the stem cell fate decision by maintaining their self-renewal or stimulating the lineage-specific differentiation. In this study, main olive leaf phytochemicals oleuropein (Olp), apigenin 7-glucoside (Api7G) and luteolin 7-glucoside (Lut7G) were investigated for their potential effects on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation using both phenotypic and molecular analysis. Oleuropein and the combination of the three compounds enhanced the differentiation of CD34+ cells into myelomonocytic cells and lymphocytes progenitors and inhibited the commitment to megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages. Treatment with Lut7G stimulated both the erythroid and the myeloid differentiation, while treatment with Api7G specifically induced the differentiation of CD34+ cells towards the erythroid lineage and inhibited the myeloid differentiation. Erythroid differentiation induced by Api7G and Lut7G treatments was confirmed by the increase in hemoglobin genes expressions (α-hemoglobin, β-hemoglobin and γ-hemoglobin) and erythroid transcription factor GATA1 expression. As revealed by microarray analysis, the mechanisms underlying the erythroid differentiation-inducing effect of Api7G on hematopoietic stem cells involves the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These findings prove the differentiation-inducing effects of olive leaf compounds on hematopoietic stem cells and highlight their potential use in the ex vivo generation of blood cell.
ich is composed of α, β, and γ subunits, plays an important role in IgE-mediated allergic responses. TGF-β1 has been reported to suppress FcεRI and stem cell factor receptor c-Kit expression on mast cell surfaces and to suppress mast cell activation induced by cross-linking of FcεRI. However, the molecular mechanism by which these expressions and activation are suppressed by TGF-β1 remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of Ets homologous factor (Ehf), a member of the Ets family transcriptional factors, is upregulated by TGF-β/Smad signaling in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Forced expression of Ehf in BMMCs repressed the transcription of genes encoding FcεRIα, FcεRIβ, and c-Kit, resulting in a reduction in cell surface FcεRI and c-Kit expression. Additionally, forced expression of Ehf suppressed FcεRI-mediated degranulation and cytokine production. Ehf inhibited the promoter activity of genes encoding FcεRIα, FcεRIβ, and c-Kit by binding to these gene promoters. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Gata1, Gata2, and Stat5b were lower in BMMCs stably expressing Ehf compared with control cells. Because GATA-1 and GATA-2 are positive regulators of FcεRI and c-Kit expression, decreased expression of GATAs may be also involved in the reduction of FcεRI and c-Kit expression. Decreased expression of Stat5 may contribute to the suppression of cytokine production by BMMCs. In part, mast cell response to TGF-β1 was mimicked by forced expression of Ehf, suggesting that TGF-β1 suppresses FcεRI and c-Kit expression and suppresses FcεRI-mediated activation through upregulation of Eh.
numerous efforts have been made, the pathogenesis underlying lung squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the CNV-driven genes by an integrated analysis of both the gene differential expression and copy number variation (CNV.
burden of the CNVs was found in 10-50 kb length. The 16 CNV-driven genes mainly located in chr 1 and chr 3 were enriched in immune response [e.g. complement factor H (CFH) and Fc fragment of IgG, low affinity IIIa, receptor (FCGR3A)], starch and sucrose metabolism [e.g. amylase alpha 2A (AMY2A)]. Furthermore, 38 TFs were screened for the 9 CNV-driven genes and then the regulatory network was constructed, in which the GATA-binding factor 1, 2, and 3 (GATA1, GATA2, GATA3) jointly regulated the expression of TP6.
 CNV-driven genes might be potential contributors to the development of lung SC.
ctic icefish, a family (Channichthyidae) of teleosts within the perciform suborder Notothenioidei, are the only known vertebrates without oxygen-transporting haemoglobins and that are largely devoid of circulating erythrocytes. To elucidate the evo-devo mechanisms underpinning the suppressed erythropoiesis in the icefish, we conducted comparative studies on the transcriptomes and microRNAomes of the primary haematopoietic tissues between an icefish (Chionodraco hamatus) and two red-blooded notothenioids (Trematomus bernacchii and Gymnodraco acuticeps). We identified substantial remodelling of the haematopoietic programs in the icefish through which erythropoiesis is selectively suppressed. Experimental verification showed that erythropoietic suppression in the icefish may be attributable to the upregulation of TGF-β signalling, which coincides with reductions in multiple transcription factors essential for erythropoiesis and the upregulation of hundreds of microRNAs, the majority (&gt; 80%) of which potentially target erythropoiesis regulating factors. Of the six microRNAs selected for verification, three miRNAs (miR-152, miR-1388 and miR-16b) demonstrated suppressive functions on GATA1 and ALAS2, which are two factors important for erythroid differentiation, resulting in reduced numbers of erythroids in microinjected zebra fish embryos. Codon substitution analyses of the genes of the TGF-β superfamily revealed signs of positive selection in TGF-β1 and endoglin in the lineages leading to Antarctic notothenioids. Both genes are previously known to function in erythropoietic suppression. These findings implied a general trend of erythropoietic suppression in the cold-adapted notothenioid lineages through evolutionary modulation of the multi-functional TGF-β signalling pathway. This trend is more pronounced in the haemoglobin-less icefish, which may pre-emptively hinder the otherwise defective erythroids from productio.
lackfan Anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome with clinical features of red cell aplasia and variable developmental abnormalities. Most affected patients have heterozygous loss of function mutations in ribosomal protein genes but the pathogenic mechanism is still unknown. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells from DBA patients carrying RPS19 or RPL5 mutations. Transcriptome analysis revealed the striking dysregulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway in DBA lines. Expression of TGFβ target genes, such as TGFBI, BAMBI, COL3A1 and SERPINE1 was significantly increased in the DBA iPSCs. We quantified intermediates in canonical and non-canonical TGFβ pathways and observed a significant increase in the levels of the non-canonical pathway mediator p-JNK in the DBA iPSCs. Moreover, when the mutant cells were corrected by ectopic expression of WT RPS19 or RPL5, levels of p-JNK returned to normal. Surprisingly, nuclear levels of SMAD4, a mediator of canonical TGFβ signaling, were decreased in DBA cells due to increased proteolytic turnover. We also observed the up-regulation of TGFβ1R, TGFβ2, CDKN1A and SERPINE1 mRNA, and the significant decrease of GATA1 mRNA in the primitive multilineage progenitors. In summary our observations identify for the first time a dysregulation of the TGFβ pathway in the pathobiology of DB.
cription factor GATA1 helps regulate the expression of thousands of genes involved in blood development, by binding to single or double GATA sites on DNA. An important part of gene activation is chromatin looping, the bringing together of DNA elements that lie up to many thousands of basepairs apart in the genome. It was recently suggested, based on studies of the closely related protein GATA3, that GATA-mediated looping may involve interactions of each of two zinc fingers (ZF) with distantly spaced DNA elements. Here we present a structure of the GATA1 ZF region bound to pseudopalindromic double GATA site DNA, which is structurally equivalent to a recently-solved GATA3-DNA complex. However, extensive analysis of GATA1-DNA binding indicates that although the N-terminal ZF (NF) can modulate GATA1-DNA binding, under physiological conditions the NF binds DNA so poorly that it cannot play a direct role in DNA-looping. Rather, the ability of the NF to stabilize transcriptional complexes through protein-protein interactions, and thereby recruit looping factors such as Ldb1, provides a more compelling model for GATA-mediated loopin.
akaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) comprises between 4% and 15% of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients. AMKL in children with Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by a founding GATA1 mutation that cooperates with trisomy 21, followed by the acquisition of additional somatic mutations. In contrast, non-DS-AMKL is characterized by chimeric oncogenes consisting of genes known to play a role in normal hematopoiesis. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is the most frequent chimeric oncogene identified to date in this subset of patients and confers a poor prognosi.
cant proportion of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is caused by human papillomavirus type 6 (HPV-6). The long control region (LCR) contains cis-elements for regulation of transcription. Our aim was to characterize LCR HPV-6 variants in RRP cases, compare promoter activity of these isolates and search for cellular transcription factors (TFs) that could explain the differences observed. The complete LCR from 13 RRP was analyzed. Transcriptional activity of 5 variants was compared using luciferase assays. Differences in putative TFs binding sites among variants were revealed using the TRANSFAC database. Chromatin immunoprecipation (CHIP) and luciferase assays were used to evaluate TF binding and impact upon transcription, respectively. Juvenile-onset RRP cases harbored exclusively HPV-6vc related variants, whereas among adult-onset cases HPV-6a variants were more prevalent. The HPV-6vc reference was more transcriptionally active than the HPV-6a reference. Active FOXA1, ELF1 and GATA1 binding sites overlap variable nucleotide positions among isolates and influenced LCR activity. Furthermore, our results support a crucial role for ELF1 on transcriptional downregulation. We identified TFs implicated in the regulation of HPV-6 early gene expression. Many of these factors are mutated in cancer or are putative cancer biomarkers, and must be further studie.
sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS that has been linked with defects in regulatory T cell function. Therefore, strategies to selectively target pathogenic cells via enhanced regulatory T cell activity may provide therapeutic benefit. Kv1.3 is a voltage-gated potassium channel expressed on myelin-reactive T cells from MS patients. Kv1.3-knockout (KO) mice are protected from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, and Kv1.3-KO Th cells display suppressive capacity associated with increased IL-10. In this article, we demonstrate that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific Kv1.3-KO Th cells exhibit a unique regulatory phenotype characterized by high CD25, CTLA4, pSTAT5, FoxO1, and GATA1 expression without a corresponding increase in Foxp3. These phenotypic changes result from increased signaling through IL-2R. Moreover, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific Kv1.3-KO Th cells can ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis following transfer to wild-type recipients in a manner that is partially dependent on IL-2R and STAT5 signaling. The present study identifies a population of Foxp3(-) T cells with suppressive properties that arises in the absence of Kv1.3 and enhances the understanding of the molecular mechanism by which these cells are generated. This increased understanding could contribute to the development of novel therapies for MS patients that promote heightened immune regulatio.
alignancy with Down syndrome (ML-DS) is estimated to have a step-wise leukemogenesis including GATA1 mutation. Trisomy 21 is essential for ML-DS; however, we do not know exactly which gene or genes located on chromosome 21 are necessary for the ML-DS. We report a female infant with transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and partial trisomy 21. SNP array analysis showed 10 Mb amplification of 21q22.12-21q22.3, which included DYRK1A, ERG, and ETS but not the RUNX1 gene. With two other reported TMD cases having partial trisomy 21, DYRK1A, ERG, and ETS were the most likely genes involved in collaboration with the GATA1 mutation.

f in&nbsp;vitro colony assays in mammals has contributed to identification of erythroid progenitor cells such as burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitors, and serves to examine functions of erythropoietic growth factors like Erythropoietin (Epo) and Kit ligand. Here, we established an in&nbsp;vitro colony-forming assay capable of investigating erythropoiesis in carp (Cyprinus carpio), cloned and functionally characterized recombinant homologous molecules Epo and Kit ligand A (Kitla), and identified three distinct erythroid progenitor cells in carp. Recombinant carp Epo induced the formation of CFU-E-like and BFU-E-like erythroid colonies, expressing erythroid marker genes, β-globin, epor and gata1. Recombinant carp Kitla alone induced limited colony formation, whereas a combination of Kitla and Epo dramatically enhanced erythroid colony formation and colony cell growth, as well as stimulated the formation of thrombocytic/erythroid colonies expressing not only erythroid markers but also thrombocytic markers, cd41 and c-mpl. Utilizing this colony assay to examine the distribution of distinct erythroid progenitor cells in carp, we demonstrated that carp head and trunk kidney play a primary role in erythropoiesis, while the spleen plays a secondary. Furthermore, we showed that presumably bi-potent thrombocytic/erythroid progenitor cells localize principally in the trunk kidney. Our results indicate that teleost fish possess mechanisms of Epo- and Kitla-dependent erythropoiesis similar to those in other vertebrates, and also help to demonstrate the diversity of erythropoietic sites among vertebrate.
an important regulator of both differentiation and function of lineage-committed hematopoietic cells. Targeted deletion of IκB kinase (IKK) β results in altered cytokine signaling and marked neutrophilia. To investigate the role of IKKβ in regulation of hematopoiesis, we employed Mx1-Cre mediated IKKβ conditional knockout mice. As previously reported, deletion of IKKβ in hematopoietic cells results in neutrophilia, and we now also noted decreased monocytes and modest anemia. Granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) accumulated markedly in bone marrow of IKKβ deleted mice whereas the proportion and number of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP) decreased. Accordingly, we found a significantly reduced frequency of proerythroblasts and basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts, and IKKβ-deficient bone marrow cells yielded a significantly decreased number of BFU-E compared to wild type. These changes are associated with elevated expression of C/EBPα, Gfi1, and PU.1 and diminished Gata1, Klf1, and SCL/Tal1 in IKKβ deficient Lineage-Sca1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells. In contrast, no effect on erythropoiesis or expression of lineage-related transcription factors was found in marrow lacking NF-κB p65. Bone marrow from IKKβ knockout mice has elevated numbers of phenotypic long and short term hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). A similar increase was observed when IKKβ was deleted after marrow transplantation into a wild type host, indicating cell autonomous expansion. Myeloid progenitors from IKKβ- but not p65-deleted mice demonstrate increased serial replating in colony-forming assays, indicating increased cell autonomous self-renewal capacity. In addition, in a competitive repopulation assay deletion of IKKβ resulted in a stable advantage of bone marrow derived from IKKβ knockout mice. In summary, loss of IKKβ resulted in significant effects on hematopoiesis not seen upon NF-κB p65 deletion. These include increased myeloid and reduced erythroid transcription factors, skewing differentiation towards myeloid over erythroid differentiation, increased progenitor self-renewal, and increased number of functional long term HSCs. These data inform ongoing efforts to develop IKK inhibitors for clinical us.
 is essential for female gamete production in mammals. The total number of ovarian follicles is determined early in life and production of ovarian oocytes is thought to stop during the lifetime. However, the molecular mechanisms underling oogenesis, particularly autophagy regulation in the ovary, remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal an important MYBL2-VDAC2-BECN1-BCL2L1 pathway linking autophagy suppression in the developing ovary. The transcription factors GATA1 and MYBL2 can bind to and activate the Vdac2 promoter. MYBL2 regulates the spatiotemporal expression of VDAC2 in the developing ovary. Strikingly, in the VDAC2 transgenic pigs (Sus scrofa/Ss), VDAC2 exerts its function by inhibiting autophagy in the ovary. In contrast, Vdac2 knockout promotes autophagy. Moreover, VDAC2-mediated autophagy suppression is dependent on its interactions with both BECN1 and BCL2L1 to stabilize the BECN1 and BCL2L1 complex, suggesting VDAC2 as an autophagy suppressor in the pathway. Our findings provide a functional connection among the VDAC2, MYBL2, the BECN1-BCL2L1 pathway and autophagy suppression in the developing ovary, which is implicated in improving female fecundit.
GF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is known to control growth, development and reproduction. Insulin-like peptide mediated body size plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster has been reported. Here, our studies showed that IIS pathway and nutrition regulate growth and maturation of the male accessory gland (MAG) in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. The size of MAG increased from day 1 to day 5 post-adult emergence (PAE). This increase in the size of MAG is contributed by an increase in cell size, but not cell number. The growth of MAG was impaired after double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated knockdown in the expression of genes coding for ILP3, InR, Chico, PI3k, AKT, and GATA1 involved in IIS pathway. Interestingly, starvation showed similar effects on the growth and maturation of MAG. The phenotypes observed in animals where IIS signaling pathway genes were knocked down are similar to the phenotypes observed after starving beetles for 5 days PAE. These data suggest that nutrition signals working through IIS pathway regulate maturation of MAG by promoting the growth of MAG cell.
iesis, in which committed progenitor cells generate millions of erythrocytes daily, involves dramatic changes in the chromatin structure and transcriptome of erythroblasts, prior to their enucleation. While the involvement of the master-regulatory transcription factors GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) and GATA-2 in this process is established, the mechanistic contributions of many chromatin-modifying/remodeling enzymes in red cell biology remain enigmatic. We demonstrated that SetD8, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), is a context-dependent GATA-1 corepressor in erythroid cells. To determine whether SetD8 controls erythroid maturation and/or function, we used a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based loss-of-function strategy in a primary murine erythroblast culture system. In this system, SetD8 promoted erythroblast maturation and survival, and this did not involve upregulation of the established regulator of erythroblast survival Bcl-x(L). SetD8 catalyzed H4K20me1 at a critical Gata2 cis element and restricted occupancy by an enhancer of Gata2 transcription, Scl/TAL1, thereby repressing Gata2 transcription. Elevating GATA-2 levels in erythroid precursors yielded a maturation block comparable to that induced by SetD8 downregulation. As lowering GATA-2 expression in the context of SetD8 knockdown did not rescue erythroid maturation, we propose that SetD8 regulation of erythroid maturation involves multiple target genes. These results establish SetD8 as a determinant of erythroid cell maturation and provide a framework for understanding how a broadly expressed histone-modifying enzyme mediates cell-type-specific GATA factor functio.
itting demand to replenish differentiated cells in tissues requires efficient mechanisms to generate and regulate stem and progenitor cells. Although master regulatory transcription factors, including GATA binding protein-2 (GATA-2), have crucial roles in these mechanisms, how such factors are controlled in developmentally dynamic systems is poorly understood. Previously, we described five dispersed Gata2 locus sequences, termed the -77, -3.9, -2.8, -1.8, and +9.5 GATA switch sites, which contain evolutionarily conserved GATA motifs occupied by GATA-2 and GATA-1 in hematopoietic precursors and erythroid cells, respectively. Despite common attributes of transcriptional enhancers, targeted deletions of the -2.8, -1.8, and +9.5 sites revealed distinct and unpredictable contributions to Gata2 expression and hematopoiesis. Herein, we describe the targeted deletion of the -3.9 site and mechanistically compare the -3.9 site with other GATA switch sites. The -3.9(-/-) mice were viable and exhibited normal Gata2 expression and steady-state hematopoiesis in the embryo and adult. We established a Gata2 repression/reactivation assay, which revealed unique +9.5 site activity to mediate GATA factor-dependent chromatin structural transitions. Loss-of-function analyses provided evidence for a mechanism in which a mediator of long-range transcriptional control [LIM domain binding 1 (LDB1)] and a chromatin remodeler [Brahma related gene 1 (BRG1)] synergize through the +9.5 site, conferring expression of GATA-2, which is known to promote the genesis and survival of hematopoietic stem cell.
 many examples of transcription factor families whose members control gene expression profiles of diverse cell types. However, the mechanism by which closely related factors occupy distinct regulatory elements and impart lineage specificity is largely undefined. Here we demonstrate on a genome wide scale that the hematopoietic GATA factors GATA-1 and GATA-2 bind overlapping sets of genes, often at distinct sites, as a means to differentially regulate target gene expression and to regulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation. We also reveal that the GATA switch, which entails a chromatin occupancy exchange between GATA2 and GATA1 in the course of differentiation, operates on more than one-third of GATA1 bound genes. The switch is equally likely to lead to transcriptional activation or repression; and in general, GATA1 and GATA2 act oppositely on switch target genes. In addition, we show that genomic regions co-occupied by GATA2 and the ETS factor ETS1 are strongly enriched for regions marked by H3K4me3 and occupied by Pol II. Finally, by comparing GATA1 occupancy in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes, we find that the presence of ETS factor motifs is a major discriminator of megakaryocyte versus red cell specificatio.
cription factor GATA1 regulates multiple genes in erythroid lineage cells. However, the means by which GATA1 regulates the expression of target genes during erythropoiesis remains to be elucidated. Three mechanisms have been postulated for the regulation of genes by GATA1. First, individual target genes may have multiple discrete thresholds for cellular GATA1. GATA1 has a dynamic expression profile during erythropoiesis, thus the expression of a set of GATA1 target genes may be triggered at a given stage of differentiation by cellular GATA1. Second, the expression of GATA1 target genes may be modified, at least in part, by GATA2 occupying the GATA-binding motifs. GATA2 is expressed earlier in erythropoiesis than GATA1, and prior GATA2 binding may afford GATA1 access to GATA motifs through epigenetic remodeling and thus facilitate target gene expression. Third, other regulatory molecules specific to each target gene may function cooperatively with GATA1. If GATA1 is required for the expression of such cofactors, a regulatory network will be formed and relevant gene expression will be delayed. We propose that the stage-specific regulation of erythroid genes by GATA1 is tightly controlled through a combination of these mechanisms in viv.
ave been made to understand how erythroid differentiation is regulated, and recent discoveries have clarified that lineage-specific transcription factor networks are essential for proper differentiation of erythroid cells. The transcription factors GATA1 and GATA2 are involved in such networks that regulate erythroid gene expression. Importantly, expression of Gata1 and Gata2 genes is also under the control of such regulatory networks. The present review is focused on the mechanism of Gata1 and Gata2 gene regulation during erythropoiesis and the physiological significance of their dynamic regulatio.
 Gata2 genes are regulated by multiple transcription factors, including their own products GATA1 and GATA2. GATA1 and GATA2 recognize specific regulatory GATA motifs, and their expression levels change dynamically during erythroid differentiation, leading to diversified gene expression during erythropoiesi.
gulations of the Gata1 and Gata2 genes are critical for proper lineage commitment and development of erythroid cells. It has been shown in transgenic mouse analyses that cis-acting GATA binding motifs are critical for the expression of Gata1 and Gata2 genes. Furthermore, expression of Gata1 and Gata2 genes along with a set of erythroid genes appeared to be regulated by GATA factor switchin.
rchical gene regulatory network in hematopoiesis is highly complex, making elucidation of the processes of specification and differentiation of hematopoietic cells a challenging task. Recent discoveries have divulged the GATA factors as central to the genetic control of hematopoiesis. In particular, hematopoietic development is subject to extensive and precise regulation of GATA-1 and GATA-2 at the molecular level. We wish to emphasize the regulatory relationships between GATA-1 and GATA-2 implicated in cell development. An advanced experimental genetic approach has provided evidence that abnormalities in this network may result in a variety of blood disorders. The most striking new finding is the novel pathogenesis arising from GATA-1 dysfunction that leads to leukemi.
, a human erythroleukemia cell line, expressing mainly the gamma-globin genes, small amount of epsilon-globin gene, but not beta-globin gene. Our previous studies demonstrated that beta-globin gene could be expressed in HEL cells induced by hydroxyurea. However, the molecular mechenism is still unknown. Here the binding patterns of GATA factors (GATA-1 and GATA-2) to the regulatory elements of human beta-globin gene were examined with the nuclear extracts from hydroxyurea-induced and uninduced HEL cells. Our results showed in EMSA assay that GATA factors could bind to the core sequence of HS2(-10681 to -10971 bp), the 3' flanking sequence of HS2 core(-10323 to -10680 bp) and the promoter of human beta-globin gene(+20 to -112 bp). However, the binding patterns between hydroxyurea-induced and uninduced HEL cells were different. Furthermore, by using Western-blot analysis, our data showed that the amount of GATA-2 was decreased in hydroxyurea-induced HEL cells. In contrast to GATA-2, the amount of GATA-1 was increased in hydroxyurea-induced HEL cells. These results showed that the different members of GATA family might play different roles during the differentiation of erythrocytes. GATA-1 may stimulate the differentiation of HEL cells, while GATA-2 can probably inhibit the differentiation of HEL cell.
cription factors GATA-1 and GATA-2 play key roles in gene regulation during erythropoiesis. Gene ablation studies in mouse revealed that GATA-2 is crucial for the maintenance and proliferation of immature hematopoietic progenitors, whereas GATA-1 is essential for the survival of erythroid progenitors as well as the terminal differentiation of erythroid cells. Both GATA-1 and GATA-2 are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner, their expression being strictly controlled during the development and differentiation of erythroid cells. Closer examination revealed a cross-regulatory mechanism by which GATA-1 can control the expression of GATA-2 and vice versa, possibly via essential GATA binding sites in their cis-acting elements. In addition, recent studies identified several human inherited hematopoietic disorders that are caused by mutations in cis-acting GATA binding motifs or mutations in GATA-1 itsel.
, a human erythroleukemia cell line, mainly express the fetal (gamma) globin gene and trace amount of the embryonic (epsilon) globin gene, but not adult (beta) globin gene. Here we show that hydroxyurea (HU) can induce HEL cells to express adult (beta) globin gene and lead these cells to terminal differentiation. Results showed in Gel mobility shift assays that GATA factors could specifically bind to the regulatory elements of human beta-globin gene, including the proximal regulatory element (the beta-promoter) and the distal regulatory elements (the DNase I hypersensitive sites in the LCR, HS2-HS4 core sequences). However, the DNA binding patterns of GATA factors were quite different between HU-induced and uninduced HEL cells. Western-blot analysis of nuclear extracts from both the uninduced and HU-induced HEL cells revealed that the level of GATA-2 transcription factor decreased, whereas the level of GATA-1 transcription factor increased following the time of hydroxyurea induction. Furthermore, using RT-PCR analysis the expression of human beta-globin gene in HU-induced HEL cells could be blocked again when HEL cells were incubated in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides for hGATA-1, suggesting that the upregulation of hGATA-1 transcription factor might be critical for the expression of human beta-globin gene in HU-induced HEL cell.
d GATA-2 transcription factors are required for effective hematopoiesis. These regulatory proteins present overlapping yet distinct patterns of expression in hematopoietic cells. Absence of GATA-2 leads to defective hematopoiesis and an embryonic lethal phenotype. Disruption of GATA-1 results in a compensatory increase in GATA-2 in early erythroid cells and incomplete erythropoiesis with embryos dying at 11.5 days. We examine the specific role of GATA-2 later in hematopoiesis, during erythroid differentiation. Stable K562 cell lines expressing various levels of GATA-2 were generated using a GATA-2 expression plasmid. Overexpression of GATA-2 transcripts was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cytospin smears, growth curve analysis, PCR, and flow cytometry were used to examine the effects of increased levels of GATA-2 in altering cell phenotype and activation of megakaryocytic markers. Human progenitor erythroid cells also were transfected with a GATA-2 expression vector. Growth curve analysis, benzidine staining, and high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis were used to study the effects of GATA-2 on erythroid maturation and proliferation.K562/GATA-2 cell lines expressing high levels of GATA-2 mRNA showed a marked decrease in proliferation and a shift in phenotype toward the megakaryocyte lineage. Ploidy analyses showed that these cell lines developed a multinuclear phenotype, including tetraploids and octaploids. PCR analysis showed activation of megakaryocyte-specific genes including thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl). Surface expression of platelet glycoprotein receptors Ib/IX (CD42b/CD42a) and IIb/IIIa (CD41/CD61) also was demonstrated by flow cytometry. In primary human adult erythroid cultures transfected with a GATA-2 expression vector, production of total hemoglobin and cell proliferation decreased in a dose-dependent manner.GATA-2 plays an important role in deciding cell lineage throughout hematopoiesis, and increased expression of GATA-2 determines megakaryocytic differentiation. Downregulation of GATA-2 is required for erythroid differentiatio.
ction of red blood cells follows the sequential formation of proerythroblasts and basophilic, polychromatophilic and orthochromatic erythroblasts, and is promoted by the hormone erythropoietin (Epo) in response to tissue hypoxia. However, little is known about the negative regulation of this process. Death receptors are a family of surface molecules that trigger caspase activation and apoptosis in a variety of cell types. Here we show that immature erythroid cells express several death receptors whose ligands are produced by mature erythroblasts. Exposure of erythroid progenitors to mature erythroblasts or death-receptor ligands resulted in caspase-mediated degradation of the transcription factor GATA-1, which is associated with impaired erythroblast development. Expression of a caspase-resistant GATA-1 mutant, but not of the wild-type gene, completely restored erythroid expansion and differentiation following the triggering of death receptors, indicating that there is regulatory feedback between mature and immature erythroblasts through caspase-mediated cleavage of GATA-1. Similarly, erythropoiesis blockade following Epo deprivation was largely prevented by the expression of caspase-inhibitory proteins or caspase-resistant GATA-1 in erythroid progenitors. Caspase-mediated cleavage of GATA-1 may therefore represent an important negative control mechanism in erythropoiesi.
studies on hematopoietic control mechanisms have been hampered by the heterogeneity of the analyzed cell populations, ie, lack of lineage specificity and developmental stage homogeneity of progenitor/precursor cells growing in culture. We developed unicellular culture systems for unilineage differentiation of purified hematopoietic progenitor cells followed by daughter cell analysis at cellular and molecular level. In the culture system reported here, (1) the growth factor (GF) stimulus induces cord blood (CB) progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate/mature exclusively along the erythroid lineage; (2) this erythropoietic wave is characterized by less than 4% apoptotic cells; (3) asymmetric divisions are virtually absent, ie, nonresponsive hematopoietic progenitors with no erythropoietic potential are forced into apoptosis; (4) the system is cell division controlled (cdc), ie, the number of divisions performed by each cell is monitored. Single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was applied to this culture system to investigate gene expression of diverse receptors, markers of differentiation, and transcription factors (EKLF, GATA-1, GATA-2, p45 NF-E2, PU.1, and SCL/Tal1) at discrete stages of erythropoietic development. Freshly isolated CD34(+) cells expressed CD34, c-kit, PU.1, and GATA-2 but did not express CD36, erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), SCL/Tal1, EKLF, NF-E2, GATA-1, or glyocophorin A (GPA). In early to intermediate stages of erythroid differentiation we monitored the induction of CD36, Tal1, EKLF, NF-E2, and GATA-1 that preceeded expression of EpoR. In late stages of erythroid maturation, GPA was upregulated, whereas CD34, c-kit, PU.1, and GATA-2 were barely or not detected. In addition, competitive single-cell RT-PCR was used to assay CD34 mRNA transcripts in sibling CD34(+)CD38(-) cells differentiating in unilineage erythroid cultures: this analysis allowed us to semiquantitate the gradual downmodulation of CD34 mRNA from progenitor cells through their differentiating erythroid progeny. It is concluded that this novel culture system, coupled with single-cell RT-PCR analysis, may eliminate the ambiguities intrinsic to molecular studies on heterogeneous populations of hematopoietic progenitors/precursors growing in culture, particularly in the initial stages of developmen.
ajor basic protein (MBP) is expressed exclusively in eosinophils, basophils, and placental trophoblasts. To identify the cis-elements and transcription factors involved in regulating MBP expression, we subcloned 3.2 kb of sequence upstream of the exon 9 transcriptional start site (P2 promoter) and serial 5' deletions into the pXP2 luciferase reporter vector. An 80% decrement in promoter activity was obtained when MBP sequences between bp -117 to -67 were deleted. To identify transcription factors that bind to and transactivate through the bp -117 to -67 region, we first compared the upstream genomic sequences of human and murine MBP; a potential GATA binding consensus site was conserved in the 50-bp region between the two genes. To determine which GATA proteins bind this consensus site, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), which showed that both GATA-1 and GATA-2 can bind to this consensus site. To determine the functionality of this site, we tested whether GATA-1 and GATA-2, either individually or in combination, can transactivate the MBP promoter in the Jurkat T cell line. Cotransfection with a GATA-1 expression vector produced 20-fold augmentation of MBP promoter activity, whereas GATA-2 had no activity. In contrast, combined cotransfection of GATA-1 and GATA-2 decreased the ability of GATA-1 to transactivate the MBP promoter by approximately 50%. Our results provide the first evidence for a GATA-1 target gene in eosinophils, a negative regulatory role for GATA-2 in MBP expression, and possibly eosinophil gene transcription in general during myelopoiesi.
t and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells are associated with the progressive restriction of cellular proliferation and the progressive expression of a subset of genes encoding the markers of mature cells. These two processes are genetically regulated and, in this paper, I review the expression and function of the GATA family of transcription factors as an example of this genetic regulation. GATA cis-acting elements are found in most of the regulatory regions of T-lymphoid, erythrocytic and megakaryocytic restricted genes. These GATA motifs are recognized by the members of a family of transcriptional regulators: the GATA family. Three members of this family, GATA-1, 2 and 3 are expressed in hematopoietic cells. They are necessary for the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages (GATA-1), for the T-lymphoid lineage (GATA-3), and for the proliferation of uncommitted hematopoietic precursors (GATA-2). GATA-1 displays at least four functions: activation of the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic specific genes, regulation of the epsilon--&gt;gamma globin switch and control of the cell cycle. These two last functions will be discussed to show the multiple facets of GATA-1 in the genetic regulation of hematopoiesi.
e-specific transcription factor GATA-1 is a key regulator of red blood cell differentiation. One seemingly contradictory aspect of GATA-1 function is that, while it is abundant in erythroid progenitor cells prior to the onset of overt differentiation, it does not significantly activate known GATA-1 target genes in those cells. To investigate the mechanisms underlying GATA-1 function during the transition from early to late erythropoiesis, we have examined its expression and activity in normal avian erythroid progenitor cells before and after induction of differentiation. In these primary progenitor cells, GATA-1 protein was predominantly located in the cytoplasm, while induction of differentiation caused its rapid relocalization to the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear translocation constitutes an important regulatory step in GATA-1 activation. As an alternative way of addressing the same question, we also ectopically expressed a GATA-1/estrogen receptor fusion protein (GATA-1/ER) in red blood cell progenitors, where nuclear translocation of, and transcriptional activation by, this hybrid factor are conditionally controlled by estrogen. We found that hormone-activated GATA-1/ER protein accelerated red blood cell differentiation, and concomitantly suppressed cell proliferation. These phenotypic effects were accompanied by a simultaneous suppression of c-myb and GATA-2 transcription, two genes thought to be involved in the proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Thus, GATA-1 appears to promote differentiation in committed erythroid progenitor cells both by inducing differentiation-specific genes and by simultaneously suppressing genes involved in cell proliferatio.
igated megakaryocytic differentiation in a newly-established Ph1-positive leukemic cell line, MC3, which showed tri-lineage immunophenotypes (myeloid antigens2+, CD19(1+) and CD41a1+) and was positive for CD34 and CD38. TPA induced MC3 cells to differentiate to an early stage of megakaryocyte lineage exhibiting an increase in the expression of platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb/IIIa (CD41a), and an increase in cell size and nuclear ploidy. TPA treatment also enhanced the expression of GPIIb mRNA, and induced the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its receptor mRNAs, while it did not induce transcripts of the genes IL-11 and mpl ligand, and further decreased the transcript of the mpl gene. Consistent with these findings, MC3 cells treated with TPA showed an increased expression of GATA-1, but not GATA-3 transcripts, whereas those without TPA treatment expressed only the GATA-2 transcript. These results provide an insight into the study for the regulatory mechanism of megakaryocytopoiesis and leukemic cell differentiatio.
se of this study was to examine the gene expression profile of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood (mPB)-derived progenitors, used in transplantatio.
ated gene expression patterns of highly enriched steady-state peripheral blood (PB)- and mPB-derived CD71+ cells by microarray and ingenuity pathway analyses, to identify the transcriptional program during in vitro erythroid differentiatio.
expression was more than doubled in mPB-derived (4180 genes) compared to PB-derived erythroid progenitors (1667 genes) while PB-and mPB-derived erythroid progenitors shared 1534 common genes. Comparative analysis of transcript levels showed differential expression of 54 genes between cultured erythroid progenitors of PB and mPB origin, where we identified common 13 downregulated and 30 upregulated genes. The most significant genes in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors were P4HB, DDIA3, ARPC2 and ATP5G3. Regarding G-CSF stimulation the G-CSF receptor CSF2RB (1.1-fold) was linked via STAT3 to erythroid-specific ALAS2 (2.9-fold) and GATA2 (1.3-fold) factors, all upregulated in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors, coupled to common upregulated NUDC gene involved in the proliferation of erythroid cell.
rt provides an extensive transcriptional profile of cultured erythroid progenitors and leads to a better understanding of diversity among the progenitor source.
 erythropoiesis is regulated in a non cell-autonomous fashion across evolution from frogs to mammals. In Xenopus laevis, signals from the overlying ectoderm are required to induce the mesoderm to adopt an erythroid fate. Previous studies in our lab identified the transcription factor GATA2 as a key regulator of this ectodermal signal. To identify GATA2 target genes in the ectoderm required for red blood cell formation in the mesoderm, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression in ectoderm from GATA2 depleted and wild type embryos. Our analysis identified components of the non-canonical and canonical Wnt pathways as being reciprocally up- and down-regulated downstream of GATA2 in both mesoderm and ectoderm. We show that up-regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during gastrulation blocks commitment to a hematopoietic fate while down-regulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling impairs erythroid differentiation. Our results are consistent with a model in which GATA2 contributes to inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, thereby permitting progenitors to exit the cell cycle and commit to a hematopoietic fate. Subsequently, activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling plays a later role in enabling these progenitors to differentiate as mature red blood cell.
ing protein 2 (GATA2) is a transcription factor that has essential roles in hematologic malignancies and progression of various solid tumors. Our previous studies suggested that high GATA2 expression is associated with recurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the influence of GATA2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the survival of CRC remains unknow.
ped GATA2 SNP rs2335052 using Sanger sequencing after PCR amplification, and determined GATA2 expression by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 180 CRC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to analyze the association between the GATA2 rs2335052 genotypes and the clinical outcome of CR.
that there was no significant correlation between the rs2335052 genotypes and the expression of GATA2. However, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that the carriers of the A-allele of SNP rs2335052 were significantly associated with increased risk of recurrence and reduced disease-free survival (DFS), compared with those carrying the variant genotype of GG in rs2335052 (P = 0.021). Moreover, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that GATA2 SNP rs2335052 was an independent risk factor for the DFS of CRC patient.
ts demonstrated that GATA2 SNP rs2335052 is an independent predictor for prognosis of CRC patients. This raised the possibility that SNP rs2335052 may serve as a potential indicator for predicting recurrence of CRC after curative colectom.
ity of cases with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) are caused by auto-antibodies against GM-CSF. A multitude of genetic and exogenous causes are responsible for few other cases. Goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with PAP and hematologic disorder.
ients with GM-CSF-autoantibody negative PAP, 13 had no other organ involvement and 8 had some form of hematologic disorder. The latter were sequenced for GATA.
art of PAP ranged from 0.3 to 64 years, 4 patients were children. In half of the subjects GATA2-sequence variations were found, two of which were considered disease causing. Those two patients had the typical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, one of whom additionally showed a previously undescribed feature - a cholesterol pneumonia. Hematologic disorders included chronic myeloic leukemia, juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, sideroblastic anemia and two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A 4 year old child with MDS and DiGeorge Syndrome Type 2 was rescued with repetitive whole lung lavages and her PAP was cured with heterologous stem cell transplan.
en and adults with severe GM-CSF negative PAP a close cooperation between pneumologists and hemato-oncologists is needed to diagnose the underlying diseases, some of which are caused by mutations of transcription factor GATA2. Treatment with whole lung lavages as well as stem cell transplant may be successfu.
ous germline mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor GATA2 have recently been shown to underlie a range of clinical phenotypes, including Emberger syndrome, a disorder characterized by lymphedema and predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML). Despite well-defined roles in hematopoiesis, the functions of GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature and the mechanisms by which GATA2 mutations result in lymphedema have not been characterized. Here, we have provided a molecular explanation for lymphedema predisposition in a subset of patients with germline GATA2 mutations. Specifically, we demonstrated that Emberger-associated GATA2 missense mutations result in complete loss of GATA2 function, with respect to the capacity to regulate the transcription of genes that are important for lymphatic vessel valve development. We identified a putative enhancer element upstream of the key lymphatic transcriptional regulator PROX1 that is bound by GATA2, and the transcription factors FOXC2 and NFATC1. Emberger GATA2 missense mutants had a profoundly reduced capacity to bind this element. Conditional Gata2 deletion in mice revealed that GATA2 is required for both development and maintenance of lymphovenous and lymphatic vessel valves. Together, our data unveil essential roles for GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature and explain why a select catalogue of human GATA2 mutations results in lymphedem.
ar forces have established roles in blood vascular development and function, but whether such forces similarly influence the low-flow lymphatic system is unknown. It has been difficult to test the contribution of fluid forces in vivo because mechanical or genetic perturbations that alter flow often have direct effects on vessel growth. Here, we investigated the functional role of flow in lymphatic vessel development using mice deficient for the platelet-specific receptor C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC2) as blood backfills the lymphatic network and blocks lymph flow in these animals. CLEC2-deficient animals exhibited normal growth of the primary mesenteric lymphatic plexus but failed to form valves in these vessels or remodel them into a structured, hierarchical network. Smooth muscle cell coverage (SMC coverage) of CLEC2-deficient lymphatic vessels was both premature and excessive, a phenotype identical to that observed with loss of the lymphatic endothelial transcription factor FOXC2. In vitro evaluation of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) revealed that low, reversing shear stress is sufficient to induce expression of genes required for lymphatic valve development and identified GATA2 as an upstream transcriptional regulator of FOXC2 and the lymphatic valve genetic program. These studies reveal that lymph flow initiates and regulates many of the key steps in collecting lymphatic vessel maturation and developmen.
ranscription factor ERG has been implicated as a major regulator of both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemias harboring t(16;21), ERG function is deregulated due to a fusion with FUS/TLS resulting in the expression of a FUS-ERG oncofusion protein. How this oncofusion protein deregulates the normal ERG transcription program is unclear. Here, we show that FUS-ERG acts in the context of a heptad of proteins (ERG, FLI1, GATA2, LYL1, LMO2, RUNX1 and TAL1) central to proper expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype. Moreover, in t(16;21) FUS-ERG co-occupies genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR:RARA inhibiting target gene expression and interfering with hematopoietic differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS-ERG knockdown alleviate the myeloid-differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS-ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.Oncogene advance online publication, 6 July 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.26.
 of cis-elements in genomes are predicted to have vital functions. Although conservation, activity in surrogate assays, polymorphisms, and disease mutations provide functional clues, deletion from endogenous loci constitutes the gold-standard test. A GATA-2-binding, Gata2 intronic cis-element (+9.5) required for hematopoietic stem cell genesis in mice is mutated in a human immunodeficiency syndrome. Because +9.5 is the only cis-element known to mediate stem cell genesis, we devised a strategy to identify functionally comparable enhancers (&quot;+9.5-like&quot;) genome-wide. Gene editing revealed +9.5-like activity to mediate GATA-2 occupancy, chromatin opening, and transcriptional activation. A +9.5-like element resided in Samd14, which encodes a protein of unknown function. Samd14 increased hematopoietic progenitor levels/activity and promoted signaling by a pathway vital for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell regulation (stem cell factor/c-Kit), and c-Kit rescued Samd14 loss-of-function phenotypes. Thus, the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell cistrome revealed a mediator of a signaling pathway that has broad importance for stem/progenitor cell biolog.
e cell heterogeneity during spontaneous and transcription-factor-driven commitment for network inference in hematopoiesis. Since individual genes display discrete OFF states or a distribution of ON levels, we compute and combine pairwise gene associations from binary and continuous components of gene expression in single cells. Ddit3 emerges as a regulatory node with positive linkage to erythroid regulators and negative association with myeloid determinants. Ddit3 loss impairs erythroid colony output from multipotent cells, while forcing Ddit3 in granulo-monocytic progenitors (GMPs) enhances self-renewal and impedes differentiation. Network analysis of Ddit3-transduced GMPs reveals uncoupling of myeloid networks and strengthening of erythroid linkages. RNA sequencing suggests that Ddit3 acts through development or stabilization of a precursor upstream of GMPs with inherent Meg-E potential. The enrichment of Gata2 target genes in Ddit3-dependent transcriptional responses suggests that Ddit3 functions in an erythroid transcriptional network nucleated by Gata.
cription factor GATA2 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and is downregulated during lineage maturation. Gain of function mutations, loss of function mutations, and overexpression of GATA2 have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia. In previous studies, we and others showed that GATA2 overexpression at high levels, similar to that seen in hematopoietic stem cells, blocked differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. To better understand the effects of GATA2, we designed a Tamoxifen-inducible GATA2-estrogen receptor (ERT) vector. In the absence of Tamoxifen, small amounts of GATA2-ERT were still able to enter the nucleus in mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, providing us with a tool to test the effects of low-level GATA2 overexpression. We observed that this low-level GATA2 overexpression enhanced self-renewal of myeloid progenitors in&nbsp;vitro and resulted in immortalization of BM cells to myeloid cell lines. Continuous GATA2-ERT expression was required for the proliferation of these immortalized lines. Myeloid expansion and a block in T and B lineage differentiation were observed in mice transplanted with GATA2-ERT-expressing BM cells. Myeloid expansion occurred after the granulocyte monocyte progenitor stage, and lymphoid block was distal to the common lymphoid progenitor in transgenic mice. GATA2 appeared to induce growth via downstream activation of Nmyc and Hoxa9. Our results demonstrate that GATA2 overexpression at low level confers self-renewal capacity to myeloid progenitors and is relevant to myeloid leukemia developmen.
anscription factor deficiency has recently been described in patients with a propensity towards myeloid malignancy associated with other highly variable phenotypic features: chronic leukocytopenias (dendritic cell-, monocyto-, granulocyto-, lymphocytopenia), increased susceptibility to infections, lymphatic vasculature abnormalities, and sensorineural deafness. Patients often suffer from opportunistic respiratory infections; chronic pulmonary changes have been found in advanced diseas.
t a case of a 17-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who was admitted to the hospital with fever, malaise, headache, cough and dyspnea. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates and pneumonia was diagnosed. Despite prompt clinical improvement under antibiotic therapy, interstitial changes remained stable. A high resolution computer tomography showed severe diffuse parenchymal lung disease, while the patient's pulmonary function tests were normal and he was asymptomatic. Lung tissue biopsy revealed chronic reparative and resorptive reaction with organizing vasculitis. At the time of the initial presentation to the hospital, serological signs of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were present; EBV viremia with atypical serological response persisted during two-year follow up. No other infectious agents were found. Marked monocytopenia combined with B-cell lymphopenia led to a suspicion of GATA-2 deficiency. Diagnosis was confirmed by detection of the previously published heterozygous mutation in GATA2 (c.1081 C &gt; T, p.R361C). The patient's brother and father were both carriers of the same genetic defect. The brother had no clinically relevant ailments despite leukocyte changes similar to the index patient. The father suffered from spondylarthritis, and apart from B-cell lymphopenia, no other changes within the leukocyte pool were see.
de that a diagnosis of GATA-2 deficiency should be considered in all patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease presenting together with leukocytopenia, namely monocyto-, dendritic cell- and B-lymphopenia, irrespective of severity of the clinical phenotype. Genetic counseling and screening for GATA2 mutations within the patient's family should be provided as the phenotype is highly variable and carriers without apparent immunodeficiency are still in danger of developing myeloid malignancy. A prompt recognition of this rare condition helps to direct clinical treatment strategies and follow-up procedure.
combinations of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) disease alleles, including FLT3 and TET2 mutations, confer distinct biologic features and adverse outcome. We generated mice with mutations in Tet2 and Flt3, which resulted in fully penetrant, lethal AML. Multipotent Tet2(-/-);Flt3(ITD) progenitors (LSK CD48(+)CD150(-)) propagate disease in secondary recipients and were refractory to standard AML chemotherapy and FLT3-targeted therapy. Flt3(ITD) mutations and Tet2 loss cooperatively remodeled DNA methylation and gene expression to an extent not seen with either mutant allele alone, including at the Gata2 locus. Re-expression of Gata2 induced differentiation in AML stem cells and attenuated leukemogenesis. TET2 and FLT3 mutations cooperatively induce AML, with a defined leukemia stem cell population characterized by site-specific changes in DNA methylation and gene expressio.
morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling pathway is a critical regulator of angiogenic sprouting and is involved in vascular development in the embryo. SMAD1 and SMAD5, the core mediators of BMP signaling, are vital for this activity, yet little is known about their transcriptional regulation in endothelial cells. Here, we have integrated multispecies sequence conservation, tissue-specific chromatin, in vitro reporter assay, and in vivo transgenic data to identify and validate Smad1+63 and the Smad5 promoter as tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements that are active in the developing endothelium. The activity of these elements in the endothelium was dependent on highly conserved ETS, GATA, and E-box motifs, and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed high levels of enrichment of FLI1, GATA2, and SCL at these sites in endothelial cell lines and E11 dorsal aortas in vivo. Knockdown of FLI1 and GATA2 but not SCL reduced the expression of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in endothelial cells in vitro. In contrast, CD31(+) cKit(-) endothelial cells harvested from embryonic day 9 (E9) aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) regions of GATA2 null embryos showed reduced Smad1 but not Smad5 transcript levels. This is suggestive of a degree of in vivo selection where, in the case of reduced SMAD1 levels, endothelial cells with more robust SMAD5 expression have a selective advantag.
ys a crucial role for the mast cell fate decision. We herein demonstrate that GATA2 is also required for the maintenance of the cellular identity in committed mast cells derived from mouse bone marrow (BMMCs). The deletion of the GATA2 DNA binding domain (GATA2ΔCF) in BMMCs resulted in a loss of the mast cell phenotype and an increase in the number of CD11b- and/or Ly6G/C-positive cells. These cells showed the ability to differentiate into macrophage- and neutrophil-like cells but not into eosinophils. Although the mRNA levels of basophil-specific genes were elevated, CD49b, a representative basophil marker, never appeared on these cells. GATA2 ablation led to a significant upregulation of C/EBPα, and forced expression of C/EBPα in wild-type BMMCs phenocopied the GATA2ΔCF cells. Interestingly, simultaneous deletion of the Gata2 and Cebpa genes in BMMCs restored the aberrant increases of CD11b and Ly6G/C while retaining the reduced c-Kit expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that GATA2 directly binds to the +37-kb region of the Cebpa gene and thereby inhibits the RUNX1 and PU.1 binding to the neighboring region. Upregulation of C/EBPα following the loss of GATA2 was not observed in cultured mast cells derived from peritoneal fluid, whereas the repression of c-Kit and other mast cell-specific genes were observed in these cells. Collectively, these results indicate that GATA2 maintains cellular identity by preventing Cebpa gene activation in a subpopulation of mast cells, whereas it plays a fundamental role as a positive regulator of mast cell-specific genes throughout development of this cell lineag.
the sole histone methyltransferase in mammals capable of monomethylating histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1). Setd8 is expressed at significantly higher levels in erythroid cells than any other cell or tissue type, suggesting that Setd8 has an erythroid-cell-specific function. To test this hypothesis, stable Setd8 knockdown was established in extensively self-renewing erythroblasts (ESREs), a well-characterized, nontransformed model of erythroid maturation. Knockdown of Setd8 resulted in impaired erythroid maturation characterized by a delay in hemoglobin accumulation, larger mean cell area, persistent ckit expression, incomplete nuclear condensation, and lower rates of enucleation. Setd8 knockdown did not alter ESRE proliferation or viability or result in accumulation of DNA damage. Global gene expression analyses following Setd8 knockdown demonstrated that in erythroid cells, Setd8 functions primarily as a repressor. Most notably, Gata2 expression was significantly higher in knockdown cells than in control cells and Gata2 knockdown rescued some of the maturation impairments associated with Setd8 disruption. Setd8 occupies critical regulatory elements in the Gata2 locus, and knockdown of Setd8 resulted in loss of H4K20me1 and gain of H4 acetylation at the Gata2 1S promoter. These results suggest that Setd8 is an important regulator of erythroid maturation that works in part through repression of Gata2 expressio.
arr virus (EBV) infects nearly all humans and usually is asymptomatic, or in the case of adolescents and young adults, it can result in infectious mononucleosis. EBV-infected B cells are controlled primarily by NK cells, iNKT cells,&nbsp;CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells. While mutations in proteins important for B cell function can affect EBV infection of these cells, these mutations do not result in severe EBV infection. Some genetic disorders affecting T and NK cell function result in failure to control EBV infection, but do not result in increased susceptibility to other virus infections. These include mutations in SH2D1A, BIRC4, ITK, CD27, MAGT1, CORO1A, and LRBA. Since EBV is the only virus that induces proliferation of B cells, the study of these diseases has helped to identify proteins critical for interactions of T and/or NK cells with B cells. Mutations in three genes associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis, PRF1, STXBP2, and UNC13D, can also predispose to severe chronic active EBV disease. Severe EBV infection can be associated with immunodeficiencies that also predispose to other viral infections and in some cases other bacterial and fungal infections. These include diseases due to mutations in PIK3CD,&nbsp;PIK3R1, CTPS1, STK4, GATA2, MCM4, FCGR3A, CARD11, ATM, and WAS. In addition, patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, which can be due to mutations in a number of different genes, are at high risk for various infections as well as EBV B cell lymphomas. Identification of proteins important for control of EBV may help to identify new targets for immunosuppressive therapie.
hematopoietic cells home to bone marrow from fetal liver prenatally. To elucidate mechanisms underlying homing, we performed immunohistochemistry with the hematopoietic cell marker c-Kit, and observed c-Kit(+) cells localized inside muscle surrounding bone after 14.5 days post coitum. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD45(+) c-Kit(+) hematopoietic cells were more abundant in muscle than in bone marrow between 14.5 and 17.5 days post coitum, peaking at 16.5 days post coitum. CD45(+) c-Kit(+) cells in muscle at 16.5 days post coitum exhibited higher expression of Gata2, among several hematopoietic genes, than did fetal liver or bone marrow cells. Colony formation assays revealed that muscle hematopoietic cells possess hematopoietic progenitor activity. Furthermore, exo utero transplantation revealed that fetal liver hematopoietic progenitor cells home to muscle and then to BM. Our findings demonstrate that hematopoietic progenitor cell homing occurs earlier than previously reported and that hematopoietic progenitor cells reside in muscle tissue before bone marrow hematopoiesis occurs during mouse embryogenesi.
cleotide Polymorphisms in FTO intron 1 have been associated with obesity risk, leading to the hypothesis that FTO is the obesity-related gene. However, other studies have shown that the FTO gene is part of the regulatory domain of the neighboring IRX3 gene and that enhancers in FTO intron 1 regulate IRX3. While Irx3 activity was shown to be necessary in the hypothalamus for the metabolic function of Irx3 in mouse, no enhancers with hypothalamic activity have been demonstrated in the risk-associated region within FTO. In order to identify potential enhancers at the human FTO locus in vivo, we tested regulatory activity in FTO intron 1 using BAC transgenesis in zebrafish. A minimal gata2 promoter-GFP cassette was inserted 1.3 kb upstream of the obesity associated SNP rs9939609 in a human FTO BAC plasmid. In addition to the previously identified expression domains in notochord and kidney, human FTO BAC:GFP transgenic zebrafish larvae expressed GFP in the ventral posterior tuberculum, the posterior hypothalamus and the anterior brainstem, which are also expression domains of zebrafish irx3a. In contrast, an in-frame insertion of a GFP cassette at the FTO start codon resulted in weak ubiquitous GFP expression indicating that the promoter of FTO does likely not react to enhancers located in the obesity risk-associated region. genesis, 2015. © 2015 The Authors. genesis Published by Wiley Periodicals, In.
ryonic stem cells (ESCs) can form neuroectoderm (NE), providing a platform for in vitro dissection of NE formation. However, human ESCs can differentiate into all three germ layers. It thus is crucial to develop efficient methods for differentiation of human ESCs into NE cells. Both plating cell density and localized cell density (LCD) affect NE differentiation. Here, we developed a cell cluster-based NE differentiation method, in which both plating cell density and LCD are under control. Using our new method, high plating cell densities promote expression of PAX6, a NE marker protein. Two SMAD signaling blockers, SB431542 and NOGGIN, downregulate OCT4 and upregulate PAX6, while does not affect mRNA expression of GATA2 after 5 d of differentiation. Moreover, IB analysis showed a time-dependent upregulation of PAX6 and beta-III-tubulin together with a downregulation of OCT4 during the neural differentiation. Coexpression of both TH and beta-III-tubulin in the H9-derived cells was also detected, proving the NE cells have an ability to differentiate into one of the specific neurons. Together, we established a simple method for generating NE cells from H9 cells, which might contribute to develop high efficient method for neural differentiatio.
ll carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with MCC present with variably sized lesions that can range from red/pink to blue/violaceous and are often misdiagnosed. Lesions typically grow rapidly over a period of 3 months and are located on sun-exposed areas(1) . MCC has been associated with Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection with clonal integration of MCPyV sequences originally detected in 80% of MCC tumors(2) . Other risk factors for MCC include UV exposure, white race, old age, and acquired immunodeficiency such as HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, and lymphoproliferative disorders(3) . These associations suggest that impaired immune surveillance of MCPyV infected tissues may play a role in carcinogenesis and disease progression. This article is protected by copyright.

esis is a progressive process collectively controlled by an elaborate network of transcription factors (TFs). Among these TFs, GATA2 has been implicated to be critical for regulating multiple steps of hematopoiesis in mouse models. However, whether similar function of GATA2 is conserved in human hematopoiesis, especially during early embryonic development stage, is largely unknow.
e the role of GATA2 in human background, we generated homozygous GATA2 knockout human embryonic stem cells (GATA2 (-/-) hESCs) and analyzed their blood differentiation potential. Our results demonstrated that GATA2 (-/-) hESCs displayed attenuated generation of CD34(+)CD43(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), due to the impairment of endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). Interestingly, GATA2 (-/-) hESCs retained the potential to generate erythroblasts and macrophages, but never granulocytes. We further identified that SPI1 downregulation was partially responsible for the defects of GATA2 (-/-) hESCs in generation of CD34(+)CD43(+) HPCs and granulocytes. Furthermore, we found that GATA2 (-/-) hESCs restored the granulocyte potential in the presence of Notch signalin.
ngs revealed the essential roles of GATA2 in EHT and granulocyte development through regulating SPI1, and uncovered a role of Notch signaling in granulocyte generation during hematopoiesis modeled by human ESC.
ostic relevance of epigenetic modifying genes (DNMT3A, TET2, and IDH1/2) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been investigated extensively. However, the prognostic implications of these mutations after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have not been evaluated comprehensively in patients with normal-karyotype (NK)-AML. A total of 115 patients who received allogeneic HCT for NK-AML were retrospectively evaluated for the FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, WT1, NRAS, ASXL2, FAT1, DNAH11, and GATA2 mutations in diagnostic samples and analyzed for long-term outcomes after allogeneic HCT. The prevalence rates for the mutations were as follows: FLT3-ITD positivity (FLT3-ITD(pos)) (32.2%), NPM1 mutation (43.5%), CEBPA mutation (double) (24.6%), DNMT3A mutation (DNMT3A(mut)) (31.3%), DNMT3A R882(mut) (18.3%), TET2 mutation (8.7%), and IDH1/2 mutation (16.5%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 57.3% and 58.1%, respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that FLT3-ITD(pos) (hazard ratio, [HR], 2.23; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.006) and DNMT3A R882(mut) (HR, 2.74; P&nbsp;=&nbsp;.002) were unfavorable prognostic factors for OS. In addition, both mutations were significant risk factors for EFS and relapse. People with DNMT3A R882(mut) accompanied by FLT3-ITD(pos) had worse OS and EFS, and higher relapse rates than those with the other mutations, which were confirmed in a propensity score 1:2 matching analysis. These results suggest that DNMT3A R882(mut), particularly when accompanied by FLT3-ITD(pos), is a significant prognostic factor for inferior transplantation survival outcome by increasing relapse risk, even after allogeneic HC.
ic forces regulate many aspects of blood vessel disease and development, including susceptibility to atherosclerosis and remodeling of primary blood vessels into a mature vascular network. Vessels of the lymphatic circulatory system are also subjected to fluid flow-associated forces, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which these forces regulate the formation and maintenance of lymphatic vessels remain largely uncharacterized. This issue of the JCI includes two articles that begin to address how fluid flow influences lymphatic vessel development and function. Sweet et al. demonstrate that lymph flow is essential for the remodeling of primary lymphatic vessels, for ensuring the proper distribution of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and for the development and maturation of lymphatic valves. Kazenwadel et al. show that flow-induced lymphatic valve development is initiated by the upregulation of GATA2, which has been linked to lymphedema in patients with Emberger syndrome. Together, these observations and future studies inspired by these results have potential to lead to the development of strategies for the treatment of lymphatic disorder.
n cell fate and identity are essential for endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT), an embryonic process that generates the first adult populations of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from hemogenic endothelial cells. Dissecting EHT regulation is a critical step towards the production of in vitro derived HSCs. Yet, we do not know how distinct endothelial and haematopoietic fates are parsed during the transition. Here we show that genes required for arterial identity function later to repress haematopoietic fate. Tissue-specific, temporally controlled, genetic loss of arterial genes (Sox17 and Notch1) during EHT results in increased production of haematopoietic cells due to loss of Sox17-mediated repression of haematopoietic transcription factors (Runx1 and Gata2). However, the increase in EHT can be abrogated by increased Notch signalling. These findings demonstrate that the endothelial haematopoietic fate switch is actively repressed in a population of endothelial cells, and that derepression of these programs augments haematopoietic outpu.
e 7 deletions are highly prevalent in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and likely contribute to aberrant growth through haploinsufficiency. We generated mice with a heterozygous germ line deletion of a 2-Mb interval of chromosome band 5A3 syntenic to a commonly deleted segment of human 7q22 and show that mutant hematopoietic cells exhibit cardinal features of MDS. Specifically, the long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment is expanded in 5A3(+/del) mice, and the distribution of myeloid progenitors is altered. 5A3(+/del) HSCs are defective for lymphoid repopulating potential and show a myeloid lineage output bias. These cell autonomous abnormalities are exacerbated by physiologic aging and upon serial transplantation. The 5A3 deletion partially rescues defective repopulation in Gata2 mutant mice. 5A3(+/del) hematopoietic cells exhibit decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and perturbed oxygen consumption. These studies provide the first functional data linking 7q22 deletions to MDS pathogenesi.
ichia coli, chromosome replication is initiated from oriC by the DnaA initiator protein associated with ATP. Three non-coding regions contribute to the activity of DnaA. The datA locus is instrumental in conversion of DnaA(ATP) to DnaA(ADP) (datA dependent DnaA(ATP) hydrolysis) whereas DnaA rejuvenation sequences 1 and 2 (DARS1 and DARS2) reactivate DnaA(ADP) to DnaA(ATP). The structural organization of oriC, datA, DARS1, and DARS2 were found conserved among 59 fully sequenced E. coli genomes, with differences primarily in the non-functional spacer regions between key protein binding sites. The relative distances from oriC to datA, DARS1, and DARS2, respectively, was also conserved despite of large variations in genome size, suggesting that the gene dosage of either region is important for bacterial growth. Yet all three regions could be deleted alone or in combination without loss of viability. Competition experiments during balanced growth in rich medium and during mouse colonization indicated roles of datA, DARS1, and DARS2 for bacterial fitness although the relative contribution of each region differed between growth conditions. We suggest that this fitness advantage has contributed to conservation of both sequence and chromosomal location for datA, DARS1, and DARS.
and regulatory pathways that effectively link human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate-early (MIE) latent-lytic switch activation with progeny production are incompletely understood. In the quiescently infected human NTera2 cell model of primitive neural stem cells, we found that co-stimulation with vasoactive intestinal peptide (V) and phorbol ester (P) synergistically activated viral infection, but this effect waned over time. Coupling retinoic acid (R), an inducer of neuronal differentiation, to VP pulse-stimulation attenuated the decline in viral activity and promoted spread of the active infection through concentric layers of neighboring cells as cellular differentiation progressed. R stimulation alone was unable to activate the infection. The MIE enhancer cis-regulatory mechanisms responsible for this result were characterized by a strategy of combinatorial mutagenesis of five cis-acting element types (retinoic acid receptor binding elements (RARE), cAMP response elements (CRE), NF-κB binding sites (kB), serum response element, and ETS/ELK-1 binding site) and multiple methods of assessment. We found that the CRE and kB combination sets pre-induction enhancer tone, is the major initiator and amplifier of RVP-induced MIE gene expression, and cooperates with RARE during cellular differentiation to enhance viral spread. In pre-differentiated NTera2, we also found that the CRE-kB combination functions as initiator and amplifier of unstimulated HCMV MIE gene expression and cooperatively interacts with RARE to enhance viral spread. We conclude that RVP-stimulated signaling cascades and cellular differentiation operate through the enhancer CRE-kB-RARE core in strengthening induction of HCMV MIE gene expression in linkage with viral propagatio.
ovirus-seropositive persons commonly lack detectable levels of cytomegalovirus replication, even when profoundly immunocompromised. In a human NTera2 cell model of primitive neural stem cells carrying resting cytomegalovirus genomes, we show that co-stimulation of protein kinase A and C-delta signaling cascades in conjunction with retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation brings about progeny virus propagation. Iterated DNA binding sites for retinoic acid receptor, CREB, and NF-κB family members in the cytomegalovirus major enhancer are at the crux in the pathway to HCMV activation. The stimulated CREB and NF-κB binding site combination vigorously initiates and amplifies the active cytomegalovirus infection and cooperates with activated retinoic acid receptor binding sites to further promote viral proliferation and spread between differentiated cells. These results support a paradigm in which a specific combination of stimuli coupled with cellular differentiation satisfies a core cis-activating code that unlocks enhancer silence to re-power the cycle of cytomegalovirus propagatio.
a mutant of the initiator DnaA, causes overinitiation of chromosome replication in Escherichia coli, resulting in inhibition of cell division. CedA was found to be a multi-copy suppressor which represses the dnaAcos inhibition of cell division. However, functional mechanism of CedA remains elusive except for previously indicated possibilities in binding to DNA and RNA polymerase. In this study, we searched for the specific sites of CedA in binding of DNA and RNA polymerase and in repression of cell division inhibition. First, DNA sequence to which CedA preferentially binds was determined. Next, the several residues and β4 region in CedA C-terminal domain was suggested to specifically interact with the DNA. Moreover, we found that the flexible N-terminal region was required for tight binding to longer DNA as well as interaction with RNA polymerase. Based on these results, several cedA mutants were examined in ability for repressing dnaAcos cell division inhibition. We found that the N-terminal region was dispensable and that Glu32 in the C-terminal domain was required for the repression. These results suggest that CedA has multiple roles and residues with different functions are positioned in the two region.
rial chaperone&nbsp;high-temperature protein G (HtpG), a member of the Hsp90 protein family, is involved in the protection of cells against a variety of environmental stresses. The ability of HtpG to form complexes with other bacterial proteins, especially those involved in fundamental functions, is indicative of its cellular role. An interaction between HtpG and DnaA, the main initiator of DNA replication, was studied both in vivo, using a bacterial two-hybrid system, and in vitro with a modified pull-down assay and by chemical cross-linking. In vivo, this interaction was demonstrated only when htpG was expressed from a high copy number plasmid. Both in vitro assays confirmed HtpG-DnaA interaction.
agenomics has recently revealed the ubiquitous and diverse nature of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that encode a conserved replication initiator protein (Rep) in the marine environment. Although eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses were originally thought to only infect plants and vertebrates, recent studies have identified these viruses in a number of invertebrates. To further explore CRESS-DNA viruses in the marine environment, this study surveyed CRESS-DNA viruses in various marine invertebrate species. A total of 27 novel CRESS-DNA genomes, with Reps that share less than 60.1% identity with previously reported viruses, were recovered from 21 invertebrate species, mainly crustaceans. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Rep revealed a novel clade of CRESS-DNA viruses that included approximately one third of the marine invertebrate associated viruses identified here and whose members may represent a novel family. Investigation of putative capsid proteins (Cap) encoded within the eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viral genomes from this study and those in GenBank demonstrated conserved patterns of predicted intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which can be used to complement similarity-based searches to identify divergent structural proteins within novel genomes. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of CRESS-DNA viruses associated with invertebrates and explores a new tool to evaluate divergent structural proteins encoded by these viruse.
ircle replication of streptococcal plasmid pMV158 is controlled by the concerted action of two trans-acting elements, namely transcriptional repressor CopG and antisense RNAII, which inhibit expression of the repB gene encoding the replication initiator protein. The pMV158-encoded antisense RNAII exerts its activity of replication control by inhibiting translation of the essential repB gene. RNAII is the smallest and simplest among the characterized antisense RNAs involved in control of plasmid replication. Structure analysis of RNAII revealed that it folds into an 8-bp-long stem containing a 1-nt bulge and closed by a 6-nt apical loop. This hairpin is flanked by a 17-nt-long single-stranded 5'-tail and an 8-nt-long 3'-terminal U-rich stretch. Here, the 3' and 5' regions of the 5'-tail of RNAII are shown to play a critical role in the binding to the target mRNA and in the inhibition of repB translation, respectively. In contrast, the apical loop of the single hairpin of RNAII plays a rather secondary role and the upper stem region hardly contributes to the binding or inhibition processes. The entire 5'-tail is required for efficient inhibition of repB translation, though only the 8-nt-long region adjacent to the hairpin seems to be essential for rapid binding to the mRNA. These results show that a &quot;kissing&quot; interaction involving base-pairing between complementary hairpin loops in RNAII and mRNA is not critical for efficient RNA/RNA binding or repB translation inhibition. A singular binding mechanism is envisaged whereby initial pairing between complementary single-stranded regions in the antisense and sense RNAs progresses upwards into the corresponding hairpin stems to form the intermolecular duple.
are DNA entities that undergo controlled replication independent of the chromosomal DNA, a crucial step that guarantees the prevalence of the plasmid in its host. DNA replication has to cope with the incapacity of the DNA polymerases to start de novo DNA synthesis, and different replication mechanisms offer diverse solutions to this problem. Rolling-circle replication (RCR) is a mechanism adopted by certain plasmids, among other genetic elements, that represents one of the simplest initiation strategies, that is, the nicking by a replication initiator protein on one parental strand to generate the primer for leading-strand initiation and a single priming site for lagging-strand synthesis. All RCR plasmid genomes consist of a number of basic elements: leading strand initiation and control, lagging strand origin, phenotypic determinants, and mobilization, generally in that order of frequency. RCR has been mainly characterized in Gram-positive bacterial plasmids, although it has also been described in Gram-negative bacterial or archaeal plasmids. Here we aim to provide an overview of the RCR plasmids' lifestyle, with emphasis on their characteristic traits, promiscuity, stability, utility as vectors, etc. While RCR is one of the best-characterized plasmid replication mechanisms, there are still many questions left unanswered, which will be pointed out along the way in this revie.
-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) play diverse roles in various cellular processes that involve DNA repair and programmed cell death. Amongst these polymerases is PARP-1 which is the key DNA damage-sensing enzyme that acts as an initiator for the DNA repair mechanism. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway which is an important target for anti-hyperproliferative and anti-inflammatory drug design. Since these enzymes share a common role in the DNA replication and repair mechanisms, it may be beneficial to target both PARP-1 and DHODH in attempts to design new anti-cancer agents. Benzimidazole derivatives have shown a wide variety of pharmacological activities including PARP and DHODH inhibition. We hereby report the design, synthesis and bioactivities of a series of benzimidazole derivatives as inhibitors of both the PARP-1 and DHODH enzyme.
rium Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (Cp) causes caseous lymphadenitis (CLA), mastitis, ulcerative lymphangitis, and oedema in a number of hosts, comprising ruminants, thereby intimidating economic and dairy industries worldwide. So far there is no effective drug or vaccine available against Cp. Previously, a pan-genomic analysis was performed for both biovar equi and biovar ovis and a Pathogenicity Islands (PAIS) analysis within the strains highlighted a large set of proteins that could be relevant therapeutic targets for controlling the onset of CLA. In the present work, a structural druggability analysis pipeline was accomplished along 15 previously sequenced Cp strains from both biovar equi and biovar ovi.
ed the whole modelome of a reference strain Cp1002 (NCBI Accession: NC_017300.1) and then the homology models of proteins, of 14 different Cp strains, with high identity (≥ 85%) to the reference strain were also done. Druggability score of all proteins pockets was calculated and only those targets that have a highly druggable (HD) pocket in all strains were kept, a set of 58 proteins. Finally, this information was merged with the previous PAIS analysis giving two possible highly relevant targets to conduct drug discovery projects. Also, off-targeting information against host organisms, including Homo sapiens and a further analysis for protein essentiality provided a final set of 31 druggable, essential and non-host homologous targets, tabulated in table S4, additional file 1. Out of 31 globally druggable targets, 9 targets have already been reported in other pathogenic microorganisms, 3 of them (3-isopropylmalate dehydratase small subunit, 50S ribosomal protein L30, Chromosomal replication initiator protein DnaA) in C. pseudotuberculosi.
e provide valuable information of possible targets against C. pseudotuberculosis where some of these targets have already been reported in other microorganisms for drug discovery projects, also discarding targets that might be physiologically relevant but are not amenable for drug binding. We propose that the constructed in silico dataset might serve as a guidance for the scientific community to have a better understanding while selecting putative therapeutic protein candidates as druggable ones as effective measures against C. pseudotuberculosi.
ith small circular ssDNA genomes encoding a replication initiator protein can infect a wide range of eukaryotic organisms ranging from mammals to fungi. The genomes of two such viruses, a cyclovirus (CyCV-SL) and gemycircularvirus (GemyCV-SL) were detected by deep sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluids of Sri Lankan patients with unexplained encephalitis. One and three out of 201 CSF samples (1.5%) from unexplained encephalitis patients tested by PCR were CyCV-SL and GemyCV-SL DNA positive respectively. Nucleotide similarity searches of pre-existing metagenomics datasets revealed closely related genomes in feces from unexplained cases of diarrhea from Nicaragua and Brazil and in untreated sewage from Nepal. Whether the tropism of the cyclovirus and gemycircularvirus reported here include humans or other cellular sources in or on the human body remains to be determine.
lable structures of amyloids correspond to peptide fragments that self-assemble in extended cross β sheets. However, structures in which a whole protein domain acts as building block of an amyloid fiber are scarce, in spite of their relevance to understand amyloidogenesis. Here, we use electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyze the structure of amyloid filaments assembled by RepA-WH1, a winged-helix domain from a DNA replication initiator in bacterial plasmids. RepA-WH1 functions as a cytotoxic bacterial prionoid that recapitulates features of mammalian amyloid proteinopathies. RepA are dimers that monomerize at the origin to initiate replication, and we find that RepA-WH1 reproduces this transition to form amyloids. RepA-WH1 assembles double helical filaments by lateral association of a single-stranded precursor built by monomers. Double filaments then associate in mature fibers. The intracellular and cytotoxic RepA-WH1 aggregates might reproduce the hierarchical assembly of human amyloidogenic protein.
A is generally unwound by protein oligomers prior to replication. The Rep protein of plasmid ColE2-P9 (34 kDa) is an essential initiator for plasmid DNA replication. This protein binds the replication origin (Ori) in a sequence-specific manner as a monomer and unwinds DNA. Here we present the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of Rep (E2Rep-DBD) in complex with Ori DNA. The structure unveils the basis for Ori-specific recognition by the E2Rep-DBD and also reveals that it unwinds DNA by the concerted actions of its three contiguous structural modules. The structure also shows that the functionally unknown PriCT domain, which forms a compact module, plays a central role in DNA unwinding. The conservation of the PriCT domain in the C termini of some archaeo-eukaryotic primases indicates that it probably plays a similar role in these proteins. Thus, this is the first report providing the structural basis for the functional importance of the conserved PriCT domain and also reveals a novel mechanism for DNA unwinding by a single protei.
f the Parvoviridae family all encode a non-structural protein 1 (NS1) that directs replication of single-stranded viral DNA, packages viral DNA into capsid, and serves as a potent transcriptional activator. Here we report the X-ray structure of the minute virus of mice (MVM) NS1 N-terminal domain at 1.45Å resolution, showing that sites for dsDNA binding, ssDNA binding and cleavage, nuclear localization, and other functions are integrated on a canonical fold of the histidine-hydrophobic-histidine superfamily of nucleases, including elements specific for this Protoparvovirus but distinct from its Bocaparvovirus or Dependoparvovirus orthologs. High resolution structural analysis reveals a nickase active site with an architecture that allows highly versatile metal ligand binding. The structures support a unified mechanism of replication origin recognition for homotelomeric and heterotelomeric parvoviruses, mediated by a basic-residue-rich hairpin and an adjacent helix in the initiator proteins and by tandem tetranucleotide motifs in the replication origin.
cation initiation is mediated across all domains of life by initiator proteins oligomerizing at replication origins. Recently, it was shown that initiators can directly bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thus might enhance origin melting. In this study, we used single-molecule fluorescence assays to probe the ssDNA binding mechanism of the replication initiator DnaA. Our experiments revealed that DnaA forms a dynamic filament on ssDNA in 3' to 5' directionality in the presence of ATP and analogs. After nucleation with a three-monomer seed, monomers dynamically assemble and disassemble one monomer at a time at the 5' end, each monomer binding three nucleotides of ssDNA. The addition of adjacent double-stranded DnaA binding sites stabilized the DnaA filament on ssDNA. Our results extend the current models of origin melting via DnaA ssDNA interactio.
ic analysis of fecal samples collected from diarrheal swine detected sequences encoding a replication initiator protein (Rep). The genomes of ten novel single-stranded DNA viruses were determined, and they exhibited a similar genome organization. The two putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding Rep and the capsid protein are bidirectionally transcribed and separated by two intergenic regions. Stem-loop structure(s) typical of genomes that undergo the rolling-circle DNA replication mechanism were observed. Phylogenetically, these ten genomes are in a monophyletic clade with the previously described porcine stool-associated virus (PoSCV) but are divergent enough to be further classified into to six distinct virus clade.
horylation catalyzed by polynucleotide kinase (PNK) is an indispensable process in the repair, replication, and recombination of nucleic acids. Here, an enzyme-assisted amplification strategy was developed for the ultrasensitive monitoring activity and inhibition of T4 PNK. A hairpin oligonucleotide (hpDNA) was designed as a probe whose stem can be degraded from the 5' to 3' direction by lambda exonuclease (λ exo) when its 5' end is phosphorylated by PNK. So, the 3' stem and loop part of hpDNA was released as an initiator strand to open a molecular beacon (MB) that was designed as a fluorescence reporter, leading to a fluorescence restoration. Then, the initiator strand was released again by the nicking endonuclease (Nt.BbvCI) to hybridize with another MB, resulting in a cyclic reaction and accumulation of fluorescence signal. Based on enzyme-assisted amplification, PNK activity can be sensitively and rapidly detected with a detection limit of 1.0×10(-4)U/ml, which is superior to those of most existing approaches. Furthermore, the application of the proposed strategy for screening PNK inhibitors also demonstrated satisfactory results. Therefore, it provided a promising platform for monitoring activity and inhibition of PNK as well as for studying the activity of other nuclease.
 (CASP8) is an essential initiator of apoptosis and is associated with many diseases in humans including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. CASP8 produces a variety of transcripts, which might perform distinct functions. However, the cis and trans transcriptional determinants that control CASP8 expression remain poorly defined. Using a series of luciferase reporter assays, we identified a novel secondary promoter of CASP8 within chr2: 202,122,236 to 202,123,227 and 25 kb downstream of the previously described CASP8 promoter. ENCODE ChIP-seq data for this novel promoter region revealed several epigenetic features, including high levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and lysine 4 methylation, as well as low levels of CpG island methylation. We developed a mass spectrometry based strategy to identify transcription factors that contribute to the function of the secondary promoter. We found that the transcription activator protein PURα is specifically involved in the transcriptional activation of the secondary promoter and may exert its function by forming a complex with E2F-1 and RNA polymerase II. PURα can bind to both DNA and RNA, and functions in the initiation of DNA replication, regulation of transcription. We observed that knockdown of PURα expression decreased the transcriptional activity of the secondary promoter and mRNA expression of CASP8 isoform G. Although the physiologic roles of this secondary promoter remain unclear, our data may help explain the complexity of CASP8 transcription and suggest that the various caspase 8 isoforms may have distinct regulations and function.
on initiator 1 (Repin1) is a zinc finger protein highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue and maps within a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for body weight and triglyceride (TG) levels in the rat. The QTL has further been supported as a susceptibility locus for dyslipidemia and related metabolic disorders in congenic and subcongenic rat strains. Here, we elucidated the role of Repin1 in lipid metabolism in vivo. We generated a liver-specific Repin1 knockout mouse (LRep1(-/-)) and systematically characterized the consequences of Repin1 deficiency in the liver on body weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, liver lipid patterns, and protein/mRNA expression. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies revealed significantly improved whole-body insulin sensitivity in LRep1(-/-) mice, which may be due to significantly lower TG content in the liver. Repin1 deficiency causes significant changes in potential downstream target molecules including Cd36, Pparγ, Glut2 protein, Akt phosphorylation, and lipocalin2, Vamp4, and Snap23 mRNA expression. Mice with hepatic deletion of Repin1 display secondary changes in adipose tissue function, which may be mediated by altered hepatic expression of lipocalin2 or chemerin. Our findings indicate that Repin1 plays a role in insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism by regulating key genes of glucose and lipid metabolis.
ost is the measure of the metabolic burden of unneeded gene expression. It is defined as the lag in bacterial cells growth harboring unneeded genes relative to unburdened cells. Separate cells can concurrently adapt to the burden, demonstrating a decrease in or even a disappearance of the lag. The precise mechanisms of this adaptation are not clearly understood. One possibility is that an increased amount of free ribosomes &quot;absorb&quot; the unnecessary burden. In this work, the mechanism by which an increased concentration of ribosomes could result in faster growth and mask the unneeded gene expression burden is discussed. The initiation time of chromosome replication by the initiator protein DnaA, for which the accumulation speed depends on the ribosomes amount, is taken into accoun.

percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries, 2006-200.
p incident user design to assess impact of statin initiation on subsequent Medicare spending: (1) unadjusted pre/post initiation test; (2) unadjusted difference-in-difference (DID) with comparison series; (3) adjusted DID; (4) propensity score (PS)-matched DID with static and dynamic baseline covariates; (5) PS-matched DID by drug adherence strata; (6) PS-matched DID for high adherers controlling for healthy adherer bias; and (7) replication for ACE-inhibitor/ARB initiator.

ally significant savings in Medicare spending were observed beginning 7&nbsp;months post-initiation for statins and 13&nbsp;months post-initiation for ACEIs/ARBs. However, these savings were only observed for adherent patients in steps 5 and .
iator designs are more robust to confounding than prevalent user designs in assessing cost-offsets from drug use but still require other adjustments and sensitivity analysis to ensure proper inferenc.
stent effects of animal fat consumption during pregnancy and nursing on the programming of breast cancer risk among female offspring were studied here. We have previously found that female offspring of rat dams that consumed a lard-based high-fat (HF) diet (60% fat-derived energy) during pregnancy, or during pregnancy and lactation, were at a reduced risk of developing mammary cancer. To better understand the unexpected protective effects of early life lard exposure, we have applied lipidomics and nutrigenomics approaches to investigate the fatty acid profile and global gene expression patterns in the mammary tissue of the female offspring. Consumption of this HF diet during gestation had few effects on the mammary tissue fatty acids profile of young adult offspring, while exposure from gestation throughout nursing promoted significant alterations in the fatty acids profile. Major differences were related to decreases in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and increases in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) concentrations. In addition several differences in gene expression patterns by microarray analysis between the control and in utero or in utero and during lactation HF exposed offspring were identified. Differential dependency network (DDN) analysis indicated that many of the genes exhibited unique connections to other genes only in the HF offspring. These unique connections included Hrh1-Ythdf1 and Repin1-Elavl2 in the in utero HF offspring, and Rnf213-Htr3b and Klf5-Chrna4 in the in utero and lactation HF offspring, compared with the control offspring. We conclude that an exposure to a lard-based HF diet during early life changes the fatty acid profile and transcriptional network in mammary gland in young adult rats, and these changes appear to be consistent with reduced mammary cancer risk observed in our previous stud.
palsy (CP) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability in one-third of cases. Recent findings support Mendelian inheritance in subgroups of patients with the disease. The purpose of this study was to identify a novel genetic cause of paraplegic CP with intellectual disability in a consanguineous Pakistani famil.
med whole-exome sequencing (WES) in two brothers with CP and intellectual disability. Analysis of AP4M1 mRNA was performed using quantitative real-time PCR on total RNA from cultured fibroblasts. The brothers were investigated clinically and by MR.
fied a novel homozygous AP4M1 mutation c.194_195delAT, p.Y65Ffs*50 in the affected brothers. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed markedly reduced AP4M1 mRNA levels suggesting partial non-sense mediated mRNA decay. Several clinical and MRI features were consistent with AP-4 complex deficiency. However, in contrast to previously reported cases with AP4M1 mutations our patients show an aggressive behavior and a relatively late onset of diseas.
y shows an AP4M1 mutation associated with aggressive behavior in addition to mild dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, spastic paraparesis and reduced head circumference. Our findings expand the clinical spectrum associated with AP-4 complex deficiency and the study illustrates the importance of MRI and WES in the diagnosis of patients with CP and intellectual disabilit.
ular regulation of growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been fully clarified. In NSCLC, we detected significantly higher levels of activating protein-4 (AP4), significantly lower levels of p21, and significantly lower levels of phosphorylated SMAD2 as an indicator of activated transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor signaling, compared to the adjacent normal lung tissue. Moreover, a strong negative correlation was detected between AP4 and p21 levels. Since p21 is a potent cell-cycle inhibitor, we were thus promoted to examine the relationships among AP4, TGFβ receptor signaling, and cell growth in NSCLC. Using a human NSCLC cell line HepG2 cells, we found that activation of TGFβ receptor signaling increased p21 levels through phosphorylation of SMAD2. Moreover, AP4 inhibited phosphorylation of SMAD2 to contradict the effect of activated TGFβ receptor signaling on cell growth inhibition in NSCLC. Furthermore, binding of TGFβ1 to its receptor also directly increased AP4 transcription, which appeared to negatively control the levels of activated TGFβ receptor signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that AP4 may inhibit the phosphorylation of SMAD2, which is induced by receptor binding with TGFβ1, to abolish the inhibitory effect of activated TGFβ receptor signaling on cell growth in NSCLC. Our study thus highlights AP4 as a novel therapeutic target for NSCL.
sents a c-MYC-inducible bHLH-LZ transcription factor, which displays elevated expression in many types of tumors. We found that serum-starved AP4-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were unable to resume proliferation and showed a delayed S-phase entry after restimulation. Furthermore, they accumulated as tetraploid cells due to a cytokinesis defect. In addition, AP4 was required for c-MYC-induced cell cycle re-entry. AP4-deficient MEFs displayed decreased expression of CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2), which we characterized as a conserved and direct AP4 target. Activation of an AP4 estrogen receptor fusion protein (AP4-ER) enhanced proliferation of human diploid fibroblasts in a CDK2-dependent manner. However, in contrast to c-MYC-ER, AP4-ER activation was not sufficient to induce cell cycle re-entry or apoptosis in serum-starved MEFs. AP4-deficiency was accompanied by increased spontaneous and c-MYC-induced DNA damage in MEFs. Furthermore, c-MYC-induced apoptosis was decreased in AP4-deficient MEFs, suggesting that induction of apoptosis by c-MYC is linked to its ability to activate AP4 and thereby cell cycle progression. Taken together, these results indicate that AP4 is a central mediator and coordinator of cell cycle progression in response to mitogenic signals and c-MYC activation. Therefore, inhibition of AP4 function may represent a therapeutic approach to block tumor cell proliferatio.
ular regulation of growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is yet to be fully clarified. Here we found a significantly higher ratio of phosphorylated β-catenin (phos-β-cat) to β-catenin (β-cat) as an indicator of an activated Wnt signaling, with significantly higher levels of c-myc and transcription factor activating protein-4 (AP-4) and a significantly lower level of p21 in the resected HCC, compared to the paired adjacent healthy hepatic tissue from the patients. Moreover, strong correlations were detected between phos-β-cat/β-cat ratio and c-myc level, between c-myc and AP-4 levels, and between AP-4 and p21 levels. These data support the presence of a Wnt/c-myc/AP-4/p21 regulation cascade in HCC as has been reported in colorectal cancer. To prove it, we overexpressed c-myc in two HCC lines, which significantly increased AP-4 level, inhibited p21 level, and then increased cell growth. Meanwhile, c-myc inhibition in these two HCC lines significantly decreased AP-4 level, increased p21 level, and then decreased cell growth. Moreover, AP-4 inhibition in c-myc-overexpressing HCC lines abolished the inhibitory effect on p21 and abolished the increase in cell growth. In line with these findings, overexpression of AP-4 in these two HCC lines significantly decreased p21 level, and then increased cell growth, while AP-4 inhibition significantly increased p21 level, and then decreased cell growth. Our results on HCC are thus consistent with the model detected in colorectal carcinoma, suggesting that Wnt signaling activated c-myc may increase HCC growth through direct inhibitory effect of AP-4 on p21. Our study thus highlights AP-4 as a novel therapeutic target for HC.
ose (HG) has been reported to be associated with renal dysfunction. And one potential mechanism underlining the dysfunction is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial cells. Present study showed that EMT was induced in the HG-treated renal tubular epithelial cells by promoting the expression of mesenchymal phenotype molecules, such as α-SMA and collagen I, and down-regulating the expression of epithelial phenotype molecule E-cadherin. Moreover, we have identified the down-regulation of miR-15a which was accompanied with the HG-induced EMT. And the miR-15a overexpression inhibited the α-SMA, collagen I expression, and the promotion of E-cadherin expression by targeting and down-regulating AP4 which was also significantly promoted by the HG in the renal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, this study revealed that the weakening regulation on the AP4 expression by miR-15a might contribute to the HG-induced EMT in the renal tubular epithelial cell.
 helix-loop-helix transcription factor activating enhancer&#8209;binding protein (AP)-4 has been found to be involved in tumor biology. However, the role of AP-4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has yet to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the role of AP-4 expression in NSCLC. AP-4 expression as analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses of 42 fresh NSCLC samples and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the clinical significance of AP-4 expression in tumor tissues of NSCLC patients (n=240) and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. The correlation between AP-4 expression, clinicopathological features and clinical outcome were investigated. AP-4 expression was found to be increased in the NSCLC samples at the gene and protein levels compared with the matched adjacent noncancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the positive expression rates of AP-4 in the 240 NSCLC samples and the matched adjacent noncancerous tissues were 48.3 and 5.8%, respectively. Positive AP-4 expression was found to be significantly associated with the tumor, nodes and metastasis stage and nodal status. Furthermore, patients with NSCLC tumors expressing AP-4 were observed to have a poorer prognosis than those without AP-4 expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that AP-4 expression was an independent prognostic marker (hazard ratio, 2.543; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-5.016; P=0.016) in NSCLC. Thus, positive AP-4 expression may be a potential prognostic marker for NSCL.
ts of flavonoids from Korean Scutellaria baicalensis on fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells and their underlying molecular mechanism were investigated in this study. Flavonoids affected HT1080 cell proliferation by interrupting cell cycle progress, obviously augmenting the proportion of sub-G1 and diminishing that of G1 phase, and undergoing apoptosis at the tested dosage (100-400 μg/mL). In addition, the mediated apoptosis was mainly caused by total reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and by up-regulating the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL, triggering caspase cascades (caspase-3, -9 and -8), and inactivating PARP, dose-dependently. The proteomics results showed that AP-4, ARID 5B, HNRNP K, PLOG, Prdx6, and myosin-1, associated with cell growth, differentiation and development, and overexpressed in gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., were statistically down-regulated after the flavonoids treatment. Taken together, our data demonstrated that flavonoids from Korean S. baicalensis induced apoptosis in HT1080 cells, which involved a hierarchy of cellular pathways and multiple signal proteins, and might be a potential anticancer therapeutic agen.
rotein complex-4 (AP4) is a component of intracellular transportation of proteins, which is thought to have a unique role in neurons. Recently, mutations affecting all four subunits of AP4 (AP4M1, AP4E1, AP4S1, and AP4B1) have been found to cause similar autosomal recessive phenotype consisting of tetraplegic cerebral palsy and intellectual disability. The aim of this study was analyzing AP4 genes in three new families with this phenotype, and discussing their clinical findings with an emphasis on neuroimaging and facial features. Using homozygosity mapping followed by whole-exome sequencing, we identified two novel homozygous mutations in AP4M1 and a homozygous deletion in AP4B1 in three pairs of siblings. Spastic tetraplegia, microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, limited speech, and stereotypic laughter were common findings in our patients. All patients also had similar facial features consisting of coarse and hypotonic face, bitemporal narrowing, bulbous nose with broad nasal ridge, and short philtrum which were not described in patients with AP4M1 and AP4B1 mutations previously. The patients presented here and previously with AP4M1, AP4B1, and AP4E1 mutations shared brain abnormalities including asymmetrical ventriculomegaly, thin splenium of the corpus callosum, and reduced white matter volume. The patients also had hippocampal globoid formation and thin hippocampus. In conclusion, disorders due to mutations in AP4 complex have similar neurological, facial, and cranial imaging findings. Thus, these four genes encoding AP4 subunits should be screened in patients with autosomal recessive spastic tetraplegic cerebral palsy, severe intellectual disability, and stereotypic laughter, especially with the described facial and cranial MRI feature.
cription factor AP4 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer but its control in this setting is not fully understood. Here, we report the definition of a double-negative feedback loop involving AP4 and miR-15a/16-1 that regulates EMT and metastatic progression. In colorectal cancer cells, AP4 was downregulated by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. AP4 downregulation by p53 was mediated indirectly by the tumor-suppressive microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1, which targeted the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of AP4 mRNA, induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and inhibited colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion. The downregulation of AP4 was necessary for induction of MET and cell cycle arrest by miR-15a/16-1. In tumor xenoplants, ectopic miR-15a/16-1 suppressed formation of lung metastases. Furthermore, AP4 directly suppressed expression of miR-15a/16-1. In clinical specimens of colorectal cancer, miR-15a levels inversely correlated with AP4 protein levels shown previously to correlate with distant metastasis and poor survival. In summary, our results define a double-negative feedback loop involving miR-15a/16-1 and AP4 that stabilizes epithelial and mesenchymal states, respectively, which may determine metastatic prowes.
nalyzed the function of the c-MYC-inducible basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper transcription factor AP4 in AP4-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Loss of AP4 resulted in premature senescence and resistance towards immortalization. Senescence was accompanied by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-encoding genes p16, a known tumor suppressor, and p21, a previously described target for repression by AP4. Notably, AP4 directly repressed p16 expression via conserved E-box motifs in MEFs and human diploid fibroblasts. Senescence caused by AP4-deficiency was prevented by depletion of p16 and/or p21, demonstrating that these factors mediate senescence caused by AP4 loss. As senescence induced by the loss of AP4 was rescued by ectopic AP4, secondary lesions were not involved in causing premature senescence. Activation of c-MYC resulted in repression of p21 and p16 in AP4(+/+), but not in AP4(-/-) MEFs. Furthermore, after combined expression of c-MYC and mutant RAS in MEFs, AP4 was required for colony formation, anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in mice. In addition, combined ectopic expression of AP4 and mutant RAS in MEFs resulted in colony formation. However, additional loss of the p53 tumor suppressor was necessary for anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation of MEFs by combined AP4 and mutant RAS expression. In conclusion, this study identified AP4 as an oncogenic antagonist of cellular senescence. AP4 achieves this effect by direct repression of p16 and p21, and may thereby critically contribute to c-MYC function and tumor progressio.
on initiator 1 (Repin1) was discovered as the replication initiation-region protein 60kDa (RIP60) and characterized as a zinc finger protein involved in DNA binding and bending during initiation of DNA replication. As with many members of the zinc finger family, physiological functions and regulations of Repin1 as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive since its discovery in 1990. However, recent results have revealed interesting new insights into Repin1 function. Repin1 is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue and it has been suggested as a candidate gene for obesity and related metabolic disorders in congenic and subcongenic rat strains. Repin1 seems to participate in the regulation of genes involved in adipogenesis, lipid droplet formation and fusion, as well as glucose and fatty acid transport in adipocytes. Given the observation that Repin1 expression in human adipose tissue significantly correlates with total body fat mass and adipocyte size, therapeutic strategies to reduce Repin1 action in adipose tissue may be a potential approach to tackle adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity. Thus, human and in vitro data suggest a role of Repin1 in adipocyte function and could therefore emerge as an interesting therapeutic target in human obesit.
BB rat strains carrying a SHR segment (D4Got41-Tacr1; 60.5-122.8 Mb; BB.4S) or a WOKW segment (D4Got41-Fabp1; 60.5-104.6 Mb; BB.4W) of chromosome 4 within the BB/OK background develop facets of the metabolic syndrome when compared with their parental BB/OK rats. To narrow down potential genes involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, gene expression studies in adipose tissues of BB/OK, BB.4S, and BB.4W rats were initiated. Total RNA of subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissue of BB/OK (n=10), congenic BB.4S (n=8), and BB.4W (n=9) males at an age of 4 weeks was isolated. The mRNA expression of 92 genes involved in obesity, insulin resistance and other metabolic traits was measured by RT-PCR. Significant differences in gene expression were only found in Repin1 in both adipose tissues. Congenic BB.4W showed significantly lower gene expression than did BB.4S and BB/OK. Our findings and newly published findings of Repin1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes support the hypothesis that Repin1 may affect the development of facets of the metabolic syndrom.
l known that lipid metabolism plays an important role in the early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D). For that reason, we examined factors that influence lipid metabolism of BioBreeding/Ottawa Kalsburg (BB/OK) rats that spontaneously develop an insulin-dependent T1.
ale rats were fed a high-fat diet during pregnancy (Ssniff R-Z + 10% tallow) and their progeny were also given this diet up to an age of 30 weeks (n = 55) or 4 weeks (n = 14) to study gene expression of Pparg, Fasn, Lep, Adipoq, Repin1, Rarres 2, and Glut4 in adipose tissue. Forty-two BB/OK rats fed the normal diet (Ssniff R-Z) during pregnancy and the observation period served as control.
fat diet significantly decreased diabetes frequency in BB/OK rats when compared with control rats (71 versus 95%, p = 0.002). Although this difference was also reflected in the male rats (68 versus 100%, p = 0.003), no significant variation was observed in female rats (73 versus 90%, p = 0.23). The high-fat diet resulted in significantly reduced mRNA expression of examined genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but not in visceral adipose tissue, except for Fasn and Repin1 expressio.
t diet seems to protect BB/OK rats from T1D in a sex-specific manner. The data suggest that a high-fat diet might influence fat accumulation and/or fat metabolism and prevent T1D development in male rats, which is supported by changes in adipose tissue gene expressio.
on initiator 1 (Repin1) is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue and has been suggested as candidate gene for obesity and its related metabolic disorders in congenic and subcongenic rat strains. The cellular localization and function of Repin1 has remained elusive since its discovery in 1990. To characterize the role of Repin1 in adipocyte biology, we used siRNA knockdown technology to reduce the expression of Repin1 by electroporation of semiconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Glucose transport, palmitate uptake as well as triglyceride content were measured. In paired samples of human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, we investigated whether Repin1 mRNA expression is related to measures of fat accumulation and adipocyte size. We demonstrate that Repin1 increases during adipogenesis. RNA interference based Repin1 downregulation in mature adipocytes significantly reduces adipocyte size and causes reduced basal, but enhanced insulin stimulated glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 cells. Additionally, knockdown of Repin1 resulted in reduced palmitate uptake and significantly changed the mRNA expression of genes involved lipid droplet formation, adipogenesis, glucose and fatty acid transport. Furthermore, we found significant correlations between Repin1 mRNA expression in human paired visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and total body fat mass as well as adipocyte size. We have identified a potential role for Repin1 in the regulation of adipocyte size and expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 in adipocyte.
and subcongenic rat strains confirmed the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for facets of the metabolic syndrome between 60.53 and 77.11 Mb on chromosome 4. The analysis of candidate genes in this region favoured the replication initiator 1 (Repin1) characterized by a SNP in the coding region and a triplet repeat (TTT) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR.
ed nine rat strains (BB/OK, SHR, F344, BN, DA, LEW, hHTg, WOKW, and their founders WOK-F) and four wild rats on DNA (sequencing) and RNA level (gene expression in blood, liver, subcutaneous, and epididymal adipocytes). In addition, the rats were phenotypically characterized in order to link the rat phenotype to genotype differences in the QTL on chromosome .
 were heterozygous for the SNP (C/T), whereas all the inbred strains were homozygous. The shortest triplet repeat was found in SHR (5) and the highest was found in hHTg and WOKW (11), which developed metabolic disorders. The repeat number correlated with most phenotypic traits studied. Using linear multiple regression analysis with repeat size as the dependent variable and considering all the data of this study, it was clearly demonstrated that not only VLDL cholesterol and serum insulin but also the expression of Repin1 in the liver is significantly associated with the repeat size of the 3'UT.
cluded that the triplet repeat expansion in 3'UTR is involved in metabolic alterations as found in hHTg and WOKW rats and that the functional unknown gene, Repin1, could be a novel candidate gene for the development of facets of the metabolic syndrom.
cription of neuron-specific genes must be repressed in nonneuronal cells. REST/NRSF is a transcription factor that restricts the expression of many neuronal genes through interaction with the neuron-restrictive silencer element at the promoter level. PAHX-AP1 is a neuronal gene that is developmentally up-regulated in the adult mouse brain but that has no functional NRSE motif in its 5' upstream sequence. Here, we report that the transcription factor AP4 and the corepressor geminin form a functional complex in which SMRT and histone deacetylase 3 are recruited. The functional complex represses PAHX-AP1 expression in nonneuronal cells and participates in regulating the developmental expression of PAHX-AP1 in the brain. This complex also serves as a transcriptional repressor of DYRK1A, a candidate gene for Down's syndrome. Furthermore, compared with that in normal fetal brain, the expression of AP4 and geminin is reduced in Down's syndrome fetal brain at 20 weeks of gestation age, at which time premature overexpression of dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is observed. Our findings indicate that AP4 and geminin act as a previously undescribed repressor complex distinct from REST/NRSF to negatively regulate the expression of target genes in nonneuronal cells and suggest that the AP4-geminin complex may contribute to suppressing the precocious expression of target genes in fetal brai.
tal studies of complete mammalian genes and other genetic domains are impeded by the difficulty of introducing large DNA molecules into cells in culture. Previously we have shown that GST-Z2, a protein that contains three zinc fingers and a proline-rich multimerization domain from the polydactyl zinc finger protein RIP60 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), mediates DNA binding and looping in vitro. Atomic force microscopy showed that GST-Z2 is able to condense 130-150 kb bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) into protein-DNA complexes containing multiple DNA loops. Condensation of the DNA loops onto the Z2 protein-BAC DNA core complexes with cationic lipid resulted in particles that were readily transferred into multiple cell types in culture. Transfer of total genomic linear DNA containing amplified DHFR genes into DHFR(-) cells by GST-Z2 resulted in a 10-fold higher transformation rate than calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Chinese hamster ovarian cells transfected with a BAC containing the human TP53 gene locus expressed p53, showing native promoter elements are active after GST-Z2-mediated gene transfer. Because DNA condensation by GST-Z2 does not require the introduction of specific recognition sequences into the DNA substrate, condensation by the Z2 domain of RIP60 may be used in conjunction with a variety of other agents to provide a flexible and efficient non-viral platform for the delivery of large genes into mammalian cell.
n of DNA replication occurs with high frequency within oribeta, a short region 3' to the Chinese hamster dhfr gene. Homodimers of RIP60 (replication initiation-region protein 60 kDA) purified from nuclear extract bind two ATT-rich sites in oribeta and foster the formation of a twisted 720 bp DNA loop in vitro. Using a one hybrid screen in yeast, we have cloned the cDNA for human RIP60. RIP60 contains 15 C(2)H(2)zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding motifs organized in three clusters, termed hand Z1 (ZFs 1-5), hand Z2 (ZFs 6-8) and hand Z3 (ZFs 9-15). A proline-rich region is located between hands Z2 and Z3. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting experiments show hands Z1 and Z2 independently bind the oribeta RIP60 sites specifically, but with different affinities. Hand Z3 binds DNA, but displays no specificity for RIP60 sites. Ligation enhancement, DNase I footprinting, and atomic force microscopy assays show that hand Z2 and a portion of the associated proline-rich region is sufficient for protein multimerization on DNA and DNA looping in vitro. Polyomavirus origin-dependent plasmid replication assays show RIP60 has weak replication enhancer activity, suggesting that RIP60 does not harbor a transcriptional transactivation domain. Because vertebrate origins of replication have no known consensus sequence, we suggest that sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as RIP60 may act as accessory factors in origin identification prior to the assembly of pre-initiation complexe.
activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) induces osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic precursors via regulation of various transcription factors. Here, we show that upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), which are basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors, are involved in RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and regulation of osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) gene expression, which is an important costimulatory receptor for osteoclast differentiation. USF-1 and USF-2 are expressed in hematopoietic osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts. Interestingly, down-regulation of USF-1 by RNA interference or overexpression of a dominant-negative form of USF-1 attenuates osteoclast formation and expression of OSCAR during osteoclastogenesis. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that USFs bind directly to an E-box site in the OSCAR promoter region and activate OSCAR. In addition, USFs interact and cooperate with nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 in regulating OSCAR gene expression. Taken together, our results indicate that USFs serve as modulators in the induction of OSCAR and RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesi.
activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL), a critical activator of osteoclast differentiation, plays a pivotal role in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) gene expression. Previously, we showed that upstream stimulatory factors (USF) 1 and 2 are implicated in the RANKL-induced TRAP transcriptional activation via a 12-bp USF binding site in the TRAP promoter. In that study, we also demonstrated that a RANKL-induced nuclear protein binds to a 50-bp oligonucleotide (Oligo IV) corresponding to a distinct TRAP promoter region. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of the nuclear protein binding to Oligo IV. We identified a 21-bp sequence CTGTTTATGATGGCGAGGGGG in Oligo IV that specifically binds the RANKL-induced nuclear protein from RAW264.7 cells by performing a series of competition assays. Computer analysis of the 21-bp sequence revealed that the sequence contains a putative Yin Yang 1 (YY1) binding site overlapped with a putative activator protein-2 (AP-2) binding site. Competition and supershift assays indicated that the nuclear protein binding to the 21-bp sequence is YY1, not AP-2. Functionally, mutation of the YY1-binding site resulted in a reduction in the RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells, demonstrating that YY1 positively regulates RANKL-induced TRAP transcriptional activation. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that YY1 plays a functional role in RANKL-mediated TRAP gene expression during osteoclast differentiatio.
resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) plays an important role in bone resorption. TRAP expression in osteoclasts is regulated by receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANKL), a potent activator of osteoclast differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the RANKL-induced TRAP expression remains unknown. Here we show that two regions in the mouse TRAP promoter (one at -1858 to -1239 and the other at -1239 to -1039, relative to the translation start site) are implicated in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells. A detailed characterization of the region at -1239 to -1039 identifies a 12-bp sequence, AGCCACGTGGTG, that specifically binds nuclear proteins from RAW264.7 cells and primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Moreover, the binding is significantly enhanced in EMSA with nuclear extracts from RANKL-treated RAW264.7 cells and BMMs, suggesting that the 12-bp sequence may be involved in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. Various assays reveal that nuclear proteins binding to the 12-bp sequence are upstream stimulatory factors (USF) 1 and 2. Importantly, mutation of the USF-binding site partially blocks RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells, confirming that USF1 and USF2 are functionally involved in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. In summary, our data show that USF1 and USF2 play a functional role in RANKL-dependent TRAP expression during osteoclast differentiatio.
bulin replacement therapy has been standard treatment in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases for the past 3 decades. The goal of therapy is to reduce serious bacterial infections in individuals with antibody function defects. Approximately one-third of patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin treatment experience adverse reactions. Recent advances in manufacturing processes have resulted in products that are safer and better tolerated. Self-infusion by the subcutaneous route has become popular and resulted in better quality of life. This review summarizes the use of immunoglobulin therapy in primary immunodeficiency diseases including its properties, dosing, adverse effects, and different routes of administratio.
demonstrates ethnic differences in rates of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Appearance comparison frequency is related to these outcomes, however, research has not examined possible ethnic differences in levels of appearance comparisons nor their relation to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. The current study examined the frequency of appearance comparisons and the strength of the relationships between appearance comparisons, appearance evaluation, and disordered eating among White, Black, and Hispanic women. Measures of appearance comparison, appearance evaluation, and disordered eating were administered to 895 college women. Compared with White and Hispanic women, Black women reported fewer appearance comparisons, more positive appearance evaluation, and lower levels of disordered eating. Associations between examined variables were generally weaker among Black women. Results suggest that the reduced frequency and impact of appearance comparisons may contribute to more positive appearance evaluation and reduced levels of disordered eating among Black wome.
osis, pro-inflammatory and invasive benign disease estrogen dependent, abnormally express in endometria the enzyme P450Arom, positively regulated by steroid factor-1 (SF-1). Our objective was to study the nuclear protein contents of upstream stimulating factor 2 (USF2a and USF2b), a positive regulator of SF-1, throughout the menstrual cycle in eutopic endometria from women with and without (control) endometriosis and the involvement of nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) and G-coupled protein estrogen receptor (GPER)-.
stimulating factor 2 protein contents were higher in mid (USF2b) and late (USF2a and USF2b) secretory phase in eutopic endometria from endometriosis than control (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). In isolated control epithelial cells incubated with E2 and PGE2, to resemble the endometriosis condition, the data showed: (a) significant increase of USF2a and USF2b nuclear protein contents when treated with E2, PPT (specific agonist for ERα) or G1 (specific agonist for GPER1); (b) no increase in USF2 binding to SF-1 E-Box/DNA consensus sequence in E2-treated cells; (c) USF2 variants protein contents were not modified by PGE2; (d) SF-1 nuclear protein content was significantly higher than basal when treated with PGE2, E2 or G1, stimulation unaffected by ICI (nuclear ER antagonist); and (e) increased (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) cytosolic protein contents of P450Arom when treated with PGE2, E2, PPT or G1 compared to basal, effect that was additive with E2&nbsp;+&nbsp;PGE2 together. Nevertheless, in endometriosis cells, the high USF2, SF-1 and P450Arom protein contents in basal condition were unmodifie.
a strongly suggest that USF2 variants and P450Arom are regulated by E2 through ERα and GPER1, whereas SF-1 through GPER1, visualized by the response of the cells obtained from control endometria, being unaffected the endogenously stimulated cells from endometriosis origin. The lack of E2 stimulation on USF2/SF-1 E-Box/DNA-sequence binding and the absence of PGE2 effect on USF2 variants opposite to the strong induction that they exert on SF1 and P450 proteins suggest different mechanisms and indirect regulations. The sustained USF2 variants protein expression during the secretory phase in eutopic endometria from women with endometriosis may participate in the pathophysiology of this disease strongly associated with infertility and its characteristic endometrial invasion to ectopic sites in the pelvic cavit.
y examined the feasibility and potential efficacy of the family-centered Prevent-Teach-Reinforce (PTR) model with three families of young children with an autism spectrum disorder or language delay with sensory processing problems. Particularly, the study assessed the family adherence to the PTR intervention, changes in child behavior, family use of the Individualized Behavior Rating Scale Tool (IBRST), procedural integrity, and social validity. A multiple-baseline design across families was used to examine the functional relation between parent-implemented PTR intervention and changes in child behavior. Results indicated that the family-centered PTR process was successful in promoting parents to design and implement the PTR intervention plans with fidelity, and the parents' implemented intervention plans were effective in increasing replacement behavior and decreasing problem behavior across children. The results also indicated that the parents successfully used the IBRST to monitor their child's progress and were highly satisfied with the PTR intervention process and outcomes for their childre.
 and contrast adaptation are neuronal mechanisms employed by the visual system to continually adjust our sensitivity to light. They are mediated by an assortment of cellular and network processes distributed across the retina and visual cortex. Both have been demonstrated in the eyes of many vertebrates, but only luminance adaptation has been shown in invertebrate eyes to date. Since the computational benefits of contrast adaptation should apply to all visual systems, we investigated whether this mechanism operates in horseshoe crab eyes, one of the best understood neural networks in the animal kingdom. The spike trains of optic nerve fibers were recorded in response to light stimuli modulated randomly in time and delivered to single ommatidia or the whole eye. We found that the retina adapts to both the mean luminance and contrast of a white noise stimulus, that luminance- and contrast-adaptive processes are largely independent, and that they originate within an ommatidium. Network interactions are not involved. A published computer model that simulates existing knowledge of the horseshoe crab eye did not show contrast adaptation, suggesting that a heretofore unknown mechanism may underlie the phenomenon. This mechanism does not appear to reside in photoreceptors because white noise analysis of electroretinogram recordings did not show contrast adaptation. The likely site of origin is therefore the spike discharge mechanism of optic nerve fibers. The finding of contrast adaption in a retinal network as simple as the horseshoe crab eye underscores the broader importance of this image processing strategy to visio.
e amplification is frequent in cancer, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that disruption of the Kruppel-like factor 14 (KLF14) gene in mice causes centrosome amplification, aneuploidy and spontaneous tumorigenesis. Molecularly, KLF14 functions as a transcriptional repressor of Plk4, a polo-like kinase whose overexpression induces centrosome overduplication. Transient knockdown of KLF14 is sufficient to induce Plk4-directed centrosome amplification. Clinically, KLF14 transcription is significantly downregulated, whereas Plk4 transcription is upregulated in multiple types of cancers, and there exists an inverse correlation between KLF14 and Plk4 protein expression in human breast and colon cancers. Moreover, KLF14 depletion promotes AOM/DSS-induced colon tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal that KLF14 reduction serves as a mechanism leading to centrosome amplification and tumorigenesis. On the other hand, forced expression of KLF14 leads to mitotic catastrophe. Collectively, our findings identify KLF14 as a tumour suppressor and highlight its potential as biomarker and therapeutic target for cance.
there are efficacious, evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, youth often experience delays in seeking therapy. Myriad reasons may contribute to this lag in treatment initiation, with some youth possessing concerns about therapy. Treatment concerns are broadly characterized by worries/ambivalence about seeking treatment, including concerns about the negative reactions, consequences, and inconvenience of treatment. As no studies exist for youth with anxiety disorders, this study examined the phenomenology of treatment concerns in 119 treatment-seeking, anxious youth and utilized a structural equation model to examine the relationship between child anxiety, depressive symptoms, treatment concerns, and anxiety-related functional impairment. Over 90&nbsp;% of the children positively endorsed some type of treatment-related fear, with the most frequently expressed concern being that therapy would take too much time (50.4&nbsp;%). Based on the model, both child anxiety and depressive symptoms predicted functional impairment, and treatment concerns mediated the relationship between child anxiety and functional impairmen.
 in heavily-doped polymer composites, characterized by localized charge regions, is examined in light of the recent interest in polymers for thermoelectric applications. The developed fundamental transport theory describes carrier tunneling between charged localizations by taking into account thermally induced fluctuations of the applied potential. A range of characteristic behaviors corresponding to experimental data are described. Deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law are also identified. This novel theory enables the determination of factors dominating the transport in polymers and a comparison to tunneling without thermal fluctuations is also provided. The obtained asymptotic expressions for the conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and carrier thermal conductivity are particularly useful for elucidating possible routes for thermoelectric transport control and optimizatio.
ive analysis of MUC1, a cell membrane associated mucin, expressed by intact cells of epithelial origin previously has been limited to flow cytometry, which requires using large quantities of cells and antibodies. Here, for the first time, we report the development of a novel Cellular-based Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (Cell ELISA) to quantify the expression of MUC1 by cell lines of epithelial and neuroectodermal origin using an antibody recognizing a specific tandem repeat found in the extracellular domain of MUC1. In contrast to flow cytometry, this method requires a much lower number of cells. We report here the results obtained from two variants of this Cell ELISA in live and fixed cells. We found that the Cell ELISA in live cells was not sensitive enough to detect a difference in MUC1 levels between the normal cells and tumor cells. However, we found that Cell ELISA in fixed cells followed by whole cell staining was a dependable method of MUC1 level detection in the normal and tumor cells showing significantly higher levels of MUC1 receptor in the tumor cells when compared to the normal controls. Therefore, we conclude that the Cell ELISA in fixed cells is an efficient method for quantifying the expression of MUC1 by epithelial and neuroectodermal cancer cell line.
f this study was to report an acute onset of symptoms erroneously attributed to serotonin syndrome in a child who had been given both anticholinergic and serotonergic agent.
old girl with chronic anxiety and gastrointestinal problems was prescribed oral sertraline 6.25 mg daily, as well as hyoscyamine, ondansetron, montelukast, and a course of nitazoxanide. She was also routinely given diphenhydramine and omeprazole. Three days after increasing sertraline to 12.5 mg, she presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, hallucinations, mydriasis, tachycardia, and pyrexia. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and subsequently treated unsuccessfully for serotonin syndrome, with blurred vision and clonus persisting at discharge 4 days after admittance. Upon follow-up with her outpatient clinic, all anticholinergic agents were discontinued, and symptoms slowly resolve.
 illustrates the importance of differential diagnosis between toxidromes and how clinical presentation can be altered by preexisting conditions as well as the use of medications that affect multiple neurotransmitter system.
, the resident immune cells of the brain, have been shown to display a complex spectrum of roles that span from neurotrophic to neurotoxic depending on their activation status. Microglia can be classified into four stages of activation, M1, which most closely matches the classical (pro-inflammatory) activation stage, and the alternative activation stages M2a, M2b, and M2c. The alternative activation stages have not yet been comprehensively analyzed through unbiased, global-scale protein expression profiling. In this study, BV2 mouse immortalized microglial cells were stimulated with agonists specific for each of the four stages and total protein expression for 4,644 protein groups was quantified using SILAC-based proteomic analysis. After validating induction of the various stages through a targeted cytokine assay and western blotting of activation states, the data revealed novel insights into the similarities and differences between the various states. The data identify several protein groups whose expression in the anti-inflammatory, pro-healing activation states are altered presumably to curtail inflammatory activation through differential protein expression, in the M2a state including CD74, LYN, SQST1, TLR2, and CD14. The differential expression of these proteins promotes healing, limits phagocytosis, and limits activation of reactive nitrogen species through toll-like receptor cascades. The M2c state appears to center around the down-regulation of a key member in the formation of actin-rich phagosomes, SLP-76. In addition, the proteomic data identified a novel activation marker, DAB2, which is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is significantly different between M2a and either M1 or M2b states. Western blot analysis of mouse primary microglia stimulated with the various agonists of the classical and alternative activation states revealed a similar trend of DAB2 expression compared with BV2 cell.
 liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection are increasingly common causes of death among HIV-infected individuals. However, there are few clinical investigations of HIV/HCV co-infected individuals from low and middle-income nations. Here, we compare the epidemiology of HCV-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals in Southern China and examine hepatic fibrosis scores in co-infected individual.
ted a retrospective cross-sectional study of treatment-naïve HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected subjects. Bivariate and multivariate models were used to examine the association between demographics and HCV genotype. Among co-infected individuals, we also studied the relationship between fibrosis scores derived from non-invasive studies and HCV genotyp.
 collected from 175 HCV-infected individuals, including 89 (51&nbsp;%) HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. HIV/HCV co-infection was correlated with intravenous drug use (AOR 46.25, p &lt; 0.001) and not completing high school (AOR 17.39, p &lt; 0.001) in a multivariate model. HIV/HCV co-infected individuals were more likely to be infected with HCV genotype 6a (p &lt; 0.0001) or 3a (p &lt; 0.023), whereas increased fibrosis (FIB-4 score) was associated with HCV genotype 3a infection (β 2.18, p &lt; 0.001.
ts suggest that intravenous drug use is driving HIV/HCV co-infection in Southern China. While additional studies are needed, HCV genotype 6a is more common and genotype 3a appears to be associated with more severe hepatic fibrosis in co-infected individual.
V/HCV co-infection research in China should focus on at risk populations, HCV testing uptake, and genotype-specific treatmen.
s of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are key components of GPCR complexes, interacting directly with G protein α-subunits to enhance their intrinsic GTPase activity. The functional consequence is an accelerated termination of G protein effectors including certain ion channels. RGS proteins have a profound impact on the membrane-delimited gating behavior of G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels as demonstrated in reconstitution assays and recent RGS knockout mice studies. Akin to GPCRs and G protein αβγ subunits, multiple RGS isoforms are expressed within single GIRK-expressing neurons, suggesting functional redundancy and/or specificity in GPCR-GIRK channel signaling. The extent and impact of RGS redundancy in neuronal GPCR-GIRK channel signaling is currently not fully appreciated; however, recent studies from RGS knockout mice are providing important new clues on the impact of individual endogenous RGS proteins and the extent of RGS functional redundancy. Incorporating &quot;tools&quot; such as engineered RGS-resistant Gαi/o subunits provide an important assessment method for determining the impact of all endogenous RGS proteins on a given GPCR response and an accounting benchmark to assess the impact of individual RGS knockouts on overall RGS redundancy within a given neuron. Elucidating the degree of regulation attributable to specific RGS proteins in GIRK channel function will aid in the assessment of individual RGS proteins as viable therapeutic targets in epilepsy, ataxia's, memory disorders, and a growing list of neurological disorder.
chusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale (MGH-HPS) and the NIMH Trichotillomania Severity Scale (NIMH-TSS) are two widely used measures of trichotillomania severity. Despite their popular use, currently no empirically-supported guidelines exist to determine the degrees of change on these scales that best indicate treatment response. Determination of such criteria could aid in clinical decision-making by defining clinically significant treatment response/recovery and producing accurate power analyses for use in clinical trials research. Adults with trichotillomania (N=69) participated in a randomized controlled trial of psychotherapy and were assessed before and after treatment. Response status was measured via the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale, and remission status was measured via the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale. For treatment response, a 45% reduction or 7-point raw score change on the MGH-HPS was the best indicator of clinically significant treatment response, and on the NIMH-TSS, a 30-40% reduction or 6-point raw score difference was most effective cutoff. For disorder remission, a 55-60% reduction or 7-point raw score change on the MGH-HPS was the best predictor, and on the NIMH-TSS, a 65% reduction or 6-point raw score change was the best indicator of disorder remission. Implications of these findings are discusse.
ses selectively package two copies of their unspliced genomes by what appears to be a dimerization-dependent RNA packaging mechanism. Dimerization of human immunodeficiency virus Type-1 (HIV-1) genomes is initiated by &quot;kissing&quot; interactions between GC-rich palindromic loop residues of a conserved hairpin (DIS), and is indirectly promoted by long-range base pairing between residues overlapping the gag start codon (AUG) and an upstream Unique 5' element (U5). The DIS and U5:AUG structures are phylogenetically conserved among divergent retroviruses, suggesting conserved functions. However, some studies suggest that the DIS of HIV-2 does not participate in dimerization, and that U5:AUG pairing inhibits, rather than promotes, genome dimerization. We prepared RNAs corresponding to native and mutant forms of the 5' leaders of HIV-1 (NL4-3 strain), HIV-2 (ROD strain), and two divergent strains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV; cpz-TAN1 and -US strains), and probed for potential roles of the DIS and U5:AUG base pairing on intrinsic and NC-dependent dimerization by mutagenesis, gel electrophoresis, and NMR spectroscop.
orms of the native HIV-2 and SIV leaders were only detectable using running buffers that contained Mg(2+), indicating that these dimers are more labile than that of the HIV-1 leader. Mutations designed to promote U5:AUG base pairing promoted dimerization of the HIV-2 and SIV RNAs, whereas mutations that prevented U5:AUG pairing inhibited dimerization. Chimeric HIV-2 and SIV leader RNAs containing the dimer-promoting loop of HIV-1 (DIS) exhibited HIV-1 leader-like dimerization properties, whereas an HIV-1NL4-3 mutant containing the SIVcpzTAN1 DIS loop behaved like the SIVcpzTAN1 leader. The cognate NC proteins exhibited varying abilities to promote dimerization of the retroviral leader RNAs, but none were able to convert labile dimers to non-labile dimer.
ng that U5:AUG formation promotes dimerization of the full-length HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVcpzUS, and SIVcpzTAN1 5' leaders suggests that these retroviruses utilize a common RNA structural switch mechanism to modulate function. Differences in native and NC-dependent dimerization propensity and lability are due to variations in the compositions of the DIS loop residues rather than other sequences within the leader RNAs. Although NC is a well-known RNA chaperone, its role in dimerization has the hallmarks of a classical riboswitc.
cavernous malformations (CCM) of the temporal lobe often present with seizures. Surgical resection of these lesions can offer durable seizure control. There is, however, no universally accepted methodology for assessing and surgically treating these patients. We propose an algorithm to maximize positive surgical outcomes (seizure control) while minimizing post-surgical neurological defici.
ective review of 34 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for radiographically proven temporal lobe CCM was conducted. Patients underwent a relatively standard work-up for seizure localization. In patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), a complete resection of the epileptogenic zone was performed including amygdalo-hippocampectomy in addition to a lesionectomy if not contraindicated by pre-operative work-up. Patients with neocortical epilepsy underwent intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG)-guided lesionectom.
ree rate for mesial and neocortical (anterior, lateral, and basal) location was 90 vs. 83&nbsp;%, respectively. Complete resection of the lesion, irrespective of location, was statistically significant for seizure control (p = 0.018). There was no difference in seizure control based on disease duration or location (p &gt; 0.05). Patients with mesial temporal CCM who presented with MTLE were presumed to also have mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), or dual pathology. These patients underwent routine resection of the mesial structures. Interestingly, patients who had MTLE and basal (neocortical) lesions who underwent a mesial resection for suspected MTS were found not to have dual patholog.
with temporal lobe CCM should be offered resection for durable seizure control, prevention of secondary epileptogenic foci, and elimination of hemorrhage risk. The preoperative work-up should follow a team approach. Surgical intervention should include complete lesionectomy in all cases. Intra or extra-operative ECoG for neocortical lesions may be beneficial. Management of mesial temporal CCMs (archicortex) should consider resection of a well-defined epileptogenic zone (including mesial structures) due to high probability of pathologically proven MTS. The use of this treatment algorithm is useful for the education and treatment of these patient.
associated with a decline in function in many of the stem cell niches of the body. An emerging body of literature suggests that one of the reasons for this decline in function is due to cell non-autonomous influences on the niche from the body. For example, studies using the technique of parabiosis have demonstrated a negative influence of blood from aged mice on muscle satellite cells and neurogenesis in young mice. We examined if we could reverse this effect of aged serum on stem cell proliferation by treating aged rats with NT-020, a dietary supplement containing blueberry, green tea, vitamin D3, and carnosine that has been shown to increase neurogenesis in aged rats. Young and aged rats were administered either control NIH-31 diet or one supplemented with NT-020 for 28&nbsp;days, and serum was collected upon euthanasia. The serum was used in cultures of both rat hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Serum from aged rats significantly reduced cell proliferation as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays in both NPCs and MSCs. Serum from aged rats treated with NT-020 was not different from serum from young rats. Therefore, NT-020 rescued the effect of serum from aged rats to reduce stem cell proliferatio.
tia is defined as excess glandular growth of breast tissue in males. It is a noticeable physical difference that commonly affects males in adolescence and old age. While often transient in nature, gynecomastia persists indefinitely in 10% of cases. Much of the literature on gynecomastia has focused on etiology and management. Little research has been done regarding the impact of gynecomastia on one's mental health and quality of life; however, some studies have suggested various psychosocial and psychological consequences related to gynecomastia. These consequences include but are not limited to depression, anxiety, disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, and reduced self-esteem. The aims of this paper are to review the current gynecomastia literature, bring awareness to an understudied but troubled population, and discuss directions for future work, including offering extant models of body image to guide researcher.

n and 714 men agreed to participate. The mean age was 56.3 years (59.0 years for men; 54.8 years for women). The most frequent marital status was married/cohabiting (69.5%). The most predominant living arrangement was living as a couple (57.2%). A considerable proportion consisted of pensioners/retirees (41.5%) and adults with a low educational level (48.7%). Sufficient monthly income was reported in 54.4% of the case.
patient, multimorbidity was measured either by the presence of ≥2 or ≥3 chronic health problems, from a list of 147 chronic health problems. Clinical data were collected using the general practitioner's knowledge of the patient's history, patient's self-report and medical records. Cluster analyses were performed to reveal distinct patterns of multimorbidit.
ocial and demographic data (sex, age, residence area, current marital status, number of years of formal education, living arrangements, professional status and self-perceived economic status). Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between sociodemographic factors and multimorbidit.
idity (2 or more chronic health problems) was present in 72.7%. When a cut-off of three or more was used, an expressive percentage of multimorbidity (57.2%) remained present. The likelihood of having multimorbidity increased significantly with age. Pensioners/retirees and adults with low levels of education were significantly more likely to suffer from multimorbidity. Cardiometabolic and mental disorders were the most common chronic health problems. Six multimorbidity clusters have been identifie.
idity was found to be a common occurrence in the Portuguese primary care users. Future primary healthcare policies should take multimorbidity into consideratio.
e are a promising source of biofuels and bioproducts, as they consume CO2 to grow, multiply quickly, and can be cultivated in wastewater and on marginal land. Development of low-cost and high-efficiency microalgal cultivation systems is important to the cost-competitiveness of algae. A floating horizontal photobioreactor (HBR) was developed that is inexpensive and scalable, as it is manufactured from inexpensive plastic film and is modular. Its performance was successfully tested using the marine microalgae Nannochloris atomus Butcher CCAP 251/4A in a 65-L prototype unit. High biomass concentration of 4.0gL(-1) and productivity of 12.9gm(-2)d(-1) was achieved indoors under artificial illumination of 31.3klux (435μmolm(-2)s(-1)). Outdoors, during semi-continuous operation in Florida, the HBR achieved over the course of 165days a maximum biomass concentration of 4.3gL(-1) and an average biomass productivity of 18.2gm(-2)d(-1) without any contamination issue.
eport we described the isolation of transcription factor E4BP4 by lambda gt11 expression cloning using a probe containing the CRE/ATF-like sequence located between -2764 bp and -2753 bp in the upstream regulatory region for the human IL-1 beta gene. DNaseI protection, gel mobility shift analysis, and cotransfection studies were performed to investigate the binding and functional properties of E4BP4 using IL-1 beta promoter sequences. By DNaseI footprinting, a protection pattern was generated over the CRE/ATF-like site and the flanking sequences by bacterially produced E4BP4. Competition experiment by gel shift assay indicated that E4BP4 bound specifically to CRE/ATF-like site, not NF kappa B-like site. In cotransfection studies, E4BP4 repressed promoter activity and this repression was mediated through the CRE/ATF-like site. Mutational analysis of E4BP4 suggested that the DNA binding as well as repression activities required leucine heptad repeat domain. Analysis of E4BP4 produced in Escherichia coli and Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus indicated that baculovirus produced protein showed enhanced binding to the CRE/ATF-like site compared to the E. coli-produced protein. Analysis of posttranslational modifications indicated that E4BP4 produced in Sf9 cells was phosphorylated and this phosphorylation was important for the DNA binding activity of E4BP.
arr virus nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) repression of CDKN2A p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) is essential for immortal human B-lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) growth. EBNA3C ChIP-sequencing identified &gt;13,000 EBNA3C sites in LCL DNA. Most EBNA3C sites were associated with active transcription; 64% were strong H3K4me1- and H3K27ac-marked enhancers and 16% were active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. Using ENCODE LCL transcription factor ChIP-sequencing data, EBNA3C sites coincided (±250 bp) with RUNX3 (64%), BATF (55%), ATF2 (51%), IRF4 (41%), MEF2A (35%), PAX5 (34%), SPI1 (29%), BCL11a (28%), SP1 (26%), TCF12 (23%), NF-κB (23%), POU2F2 (23%), and RBPJ (16%). EBNA3C sites separated into five distinct clusters: (i) Sin3A, (ii) EBNA2/RBPJ, (iii) SPI1, and (iv) strong or (v) weak BATF/IRF4. EBNA3C signals were positively affected by RUNX3, BATF/IRF4 (AICE) and SPI1/IRF4 (EICE) cooccupancy. Gene set enrichment analyses correlated EBNA3C/Sin3A promoter sites with transcription down-regulation (P &lt; 1.6 × 10(-4)). EBNA3C signals were strongest at BATF/IRF4 and SPI1/IRF4 composite sites. EBNA3C bound strongly to the p14(ARF) promoter through SPI1/IRF4/BATF/RUNX3, establishing RBPJ-, Sin3A-, and REST-mediated repression. EBNA3C immune precipitated with Sin3A and conditional EBNA3C inactivation significantly decreased Sin3A binding at the p14(ARF) promoter (P &lt; 0.05). These data support a model in which EBNA3C binds strongly to BATF/IRF4/SPI1/RUNX3 sites to enhance transcription and recruits RBPJ/Sin3A- and REST/NRSF-repressive complexes to repress p14(ARF) and p16(INK4A) expressio.
n controls of the carbon acquisition system in marine diatoms in response to environmental factors are an essential issue to understand the changes in marine primary productivity. A pyrenoidal β-carbonic anhydrase, PtCA1, is one of the most important candidates to investigate the control mechanisms of the CO(2) acquisition system in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. A detailed functional assay was carried out on the putative core regulatory region of the ptca1 promoter using a β-glucuronidase reporter in P. tricornutum cells under changing CO(2) conditions. A set of loss-of-function assays led to the identification of three CO(2)-responsive elements, TGACGT, ACGTCA, and TGACGC, at a region -86 to -42 relative to the transcription start site. Treatment with a cyclic (c)AMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP, revealed these three elements to be under the control of cAMP; thus, we designated them, from 5' to 3', as CO(2)-cAMP-Responsive Element1 (CCRE1), CCRE2, and CCRE3. Because the sequence TGACGT is known to be a typical target of human Activating Transcription Factor6 (ATF6), we searched for genes containing a basic zipper (bZIP) region homologous to that of ATF6 in the genome of P. tricornutum. Gel-shift assays using CCRE pentamers as labeled probes showed that at least one candidate of bZIP proteins, PtbZIP11, bound specifically to CCREs. A series of gain-of-function assays with CCREs fused to a minimal promoter strongly suggested that the alternative combination of CCRE1/2 or CCRE2/3 at proper distances from the minimal promoter is required as a potential target of PtbZIP11 for an effective CO(2) response of the ptca1 gen.
e leukemia virus transactivator, BLV Tax, augments transcription from three imperfect 21-bp repeats in the viral transcriptional regulatory region. Each BLV 21-bp repeat contains a cAMP response element (CRE) in the center and unique 5' and 3' neighboring sequences which are crucial for the transcriptional activation by BLV Tax. Here we describe the interactions of recombinant BLV Tax with cellular bZip proteins. The recombinant BLV Tax, tagged at the carboxy terminus with a hexahistidine extension, was prepared by solubilization in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation on the Ni(2+)-chelating Sepharose gel matrix. The renatured BLV TaxH6 activates the BLV LTR when introduced into HeLa cells by scrape loading. Furthermore, the purified BLV TaxH6 enhances binding of members of the CREB/ATF family of bZip proteins to CRE motifs by interacting with their bZip domains in vitro. Chemical cross-linking indicates that dimerization of bZip proteins such as CREB becomes greatly facilitated in the presence of BLV Tax. These results suggest that BLV Tax interacts directly with CREB/ATF-like factors to activate viral mRNA transcriptio.
m T helper (Th)-2 cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a major class of IL-4-producing T cells, required for regulation of type 2 humoral immunity; however, transcriptional control of IL-4 production in Tfh cells remains mainly unknown. Here, we show that the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like, Batf is important for IL-4 expression in Tfh cells rather than in canonical Th2 cells. Functionally, Batf in cooperation with interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 4 along with Stat3 and Stat6 trigger IL-4 production in Tfh cells by directly binding to and activation of the CNS2 region in the IL-4 locus. In addition, Batf-to-c-Maf signalling is an important determinant of IL-4 expression in Tfh cells. Batf deficiency impairs the generation of IL-4-producing Tfh cells that results in protection against allergic asthma. Our results thus indicate a positive role of Batf in promoting the generation of pro-allergic IL-4-producing Tfh cell.
 an increased risk for development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we aimed at the characterisation of the functional role of Th17-associated transcription factors in sporadic and colitis-associated colon cancer in viv.
ice deficient or transgenic for the activating protein 1 family member basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (Batf) to evaluate the role of Th17 cells during sporadic and inflammation-induced colon carcinogenesis. We also studied the expression of Batf and RORγt in patients with IBD and CR.
not retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt(RORγt) expression was significantly increased together with interleukin (IL) 23 expression in UC but not in Crohn's disease (CD) tissue samples. In CRC also Batf but not RORγt expression was increased and its expression correlated with the IL-23 and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) expression. Finally, Batf but not RORγt was coexpressed with IL-17a, IL-23R and IL-6 within CRC-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells. Functional studies in mice revealed that Batf-dependent T cells are crucial regulators of sporadic and inflammation-induced CRC. Colitis-associated Batf(-/-) tumours lacked IL-17a(+)IL-23R(+)IL-6(+)CD4(+) T cells, hence displaying characteristics reminiscent of human CRC-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells. Strikingly, Batf(-/-) tumours contained low IL-23 but high IL-17a expression levels. Tumour formation and intratumoral IL-23 expression could be restored by administration of Hyper-IL-6 consisting of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 recepto.
ndent IL-23R(+)IL-6(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells critically control IL-23 driven colitis-associated tumour formation and the progression of sporadic colon tumours. Batf-dependent IL-23R(+) T cells represent a potential future therapeutic target limiting CRC progressio.
of different DC subsets in priming and maintenance of immunity against Leishmania major (L. major) infection is debated. The transcription factor basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like 3 (Batf3) is essential for the development of mouse CD103(+) DCs and some functions of CD8α(+) DCs. We found that CD103(+) DCs were significantly reduced in the dermis of Batf3-deficient C57BL/6 mice. Batf3(-/-) mice developed exacerbated and unresolved cutaneous pathology following a low dose of intradermal L. major infection in the ear pinnae. Parasite load was increased 1000-fold locally and expanded systemically. Batf3 deficiency did not affect L. major antigen presentation to T cells, which was directly exerted by CD8α(-) conventional DCs (cDCs) in the skin draining LN. However, CD4(+) T-cell differentiation in the LN and skin was skewed to nonprotective Treg- and Th2-cell subtypes. CD103(+) DCs are major IL-12 producers during L. major infection. Local Th1 immunity was severely hindered, correlating with impaired IL-12 production and reduction in CD103(+) DC numbers. Adoptive transfer of WT but not IL-12p40(-/-) Batf3-dependent DCs significantly improved anti-L. major response in infected Batf3(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that IL-12 production by Batf3-dependent CD103(+) DCs is crucial for maintenance of local Th1 immunity against L. major infectio.
lence of allergic asthma and other atopic diseases has reached epidemic proportions in large parts of the developed world. The gradual loss of the human indigenous microbiota has been held responsible for this trend. The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a constituent of the normal gastric microbiota whose presence has been inversely linked to allergy and asthma in humans and experimental models. Here we show that oral or i.p. tolerization with H. pylori extract prevents the airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchoalveolar eosinophilia, pulmonary inflammation, and Th2 cytokine production that are hallmarks of allergen-induced asthma in mice. Asthma protection is not conferred by extracts from other enteropathogens and requires a heat-sensitive H. pylori component and the DC-intrinsic production of IL-10. The basic leucine zipper ATF-like 3 (BATF3)-dependent CD103(+)CD11b(-) dendritic cell lineage is enriched in the lungs of protected mice and strictly required for protection. Two H. pylori persistence determinants, the γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase GGT and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, are required and sufficient for asthma protection and can be administered in purified form to prevent asthma. In conclusion, we provide preclinical evidence for the concept that the immunomodulatory properties of H. pylori can be exploited for tolerization strategies aiming to prevent allergen-induced asthm.
ew highlights the control of transcriptional networks, including induction of inhibitory receptors, by T cell-specific transcription factors in exhausted T cells that accumulate in chronic viral infections including HI.
tional profiling has established distinct molecular phenotypes for exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells in chronic viral infection models. There exists a subset of transcription factors associated with exhaustion, notably Blimp-1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like and Helios. Epigenetic phenomena are likely important in regulating gene expression networks during exhaustion as illustrated by programmed death 1 promoter methylation pattern.
 chronic viral infections, CD4 and CD8 T cells defined functionally and phenotypically as exhausted have distinct transcriptional profiles. These studies have identified a core set of transcription factors that have been implicated in promoting exhaustion. However, no single factor appears to be an exhaustion determining factor, suggesting that T cell exhaustion reflects a combinatorial mechanism with multiple transcription factors interacting to influence the development of functionally exhausted T cells as well as different T effector population.
 of Bcl6 (B cell lymphoma 6) is essential for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation of antigen-stimulated CD4(+) T cells. Intriguingly, we found that Bcl6 was also highly and transiently expressed during the CD4(+)CD8(+) (double positive [DP]) stage of T cell development, in association with the E3 ligase cullin 3 (Cul3), a novel binding partner of Bcl6 which ubiquitinates histone proteins. DP stage-specific deletion of the E3 ligase Cul3, or of Bcl6, induced the derepression of the Bcl6 target genes Batf (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like) and Bcl6, in part through epigenetic modifications of CD4(+) single-positive thymocytes. Although they maintained an apparently normal phenotype after emigration, they expressed increased amounts of Batf and Bcl6 at basal state and produced explosive and prolonged Tfh responses upon subsequent antigen encounter. Ablation of Cul3 in mature CD4(+) splenocytes also resulted in dramatically exaggerated Tfh responses. Thus, although previous studies have emphasized the essential role of Bcl6 in inducing Tfh responses, our findings reveal that Bcl6-Cul3 complexes also provide essential negative feedback regulation during both thymocyte development and T cell activation to restrain excessive Tfh response.
out the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) gene (Batf(-/-)) lack TH17 and follicular helper T cells, which demonstrates that Batf is a transcription factor important for T- and B-cell differentiatio.
tudy we examined whether BATF expression would influence allergic asthm.
rt of preschool control children and children with asthma, we analyzed BATF mRNA expression using real-time PCR in PBMCs. In a murine model of allergic asthma, we analyzed differences in this allergic disease between wild-type, Batf transgenic, and Batf(-/-) mic.
sence of corticosteroid treatment, children with recurrent asthma have a significant increase in BATF mRNA expression in their PBMCs. Batf(-/-) mice display a significant reduction in the pathophysiologic responses seen in asthmatic wild-type littermates. Moreover, we discovered a decrease in IL-3 production and IL-3-dependent mast cell development in Batf(-/-) mice. By contrast, IFN-γ was induced in lung CD4(+) and CD8(+) T&nbsp;cells. Intranasal delivery of anti-IFN-γ antibodies induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in wild-type but not in Batf(-/-) mice. Transgenic overexpression of Batf under the control of the CD2 promoter/enhancer augmented lung inflammation and IgE levels in the setting of experimental asthm.
ncreased in non-steroid-treated asthmatic children. Targeting BATF expression resulted in amelioration of the pathophysiologic responses seen in children with allergic asthma, and BATF has emerged as a novel target for antiasthma intervention.
cine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF), BATF2 and BATF3 belong to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors, which regulate numerous cellular processes. Initially, BATF family members were thought to function only as inhibitors of AP-1-driven transcription, but recent studies have uncovered that these factors have unique, non-redundant and positive transcriptional activities in dendritic cells, B cells and T cells. The question of how BATF and BATF3 - which lack a transcriptional activation domain, unlike the AP-1 factors FOS and JUN - can exert unique positive transcriptional specificity has now been answered by the discovery that BATF molecules interact with members of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family. The capacity of the BATF leucine zipper regions to mediate dimerization with AP-1 factors and also to define cooperative interactions with heterologous factors explains both the positive transcriptional activity of BATF proteins and how they activate distinct sets of target genes compared with FO.
type and function of liver dendritic cells (LDCs) are poorly understood. This Snapshot summarizes our current knowledge on LDCs in the healthy and injured liver, and their role in fibrosis progression and reversal. It also draws attention to various pitfalls in the current experimental design and conclusions based on available dat.
α4β7 are the major trafficking receptors for lymphocyte migration to the gut, and their expression is induced during lymphocyte activation under the influence of retinoic acid (RA). We report here that BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like), an AP-1 protein family factor, is required for optimal expression of CCR9 and α4β7 by T helper cells. BATF-deficient (knockout [KO]) mice had reduced numbers of effector T and regulatory T cells in the intestine. The intestinal T cells in BATF KO mice expressed CCR9 and α4β7 at abnormally low levels compared with their wild-type (WT) counterparts, and BATF KO CD4(+) T cells failed to up-regulate the expression of CCR9 and α4β7 to WT levels in response to RA. Defective binding of RARα and histone acetylation at the regulatory regions of the CCR9 and Itg-α4 genes were observed in BATF KO T cells. As a result, BATF KO effector and FoxP3(+) T cells failed to populate the intestine, and neither population functioned normally in the induction and regulation of colitis. Our results establish BATF as a cellular factor required for normal expression of CCR9 and α4β7 and for the homeostasis and effector functions of T cell populations in the intestin.
ts that limit stem cell self-renewal in response to DNA damage can contribute to cancer protection but may also promote tissue aging. Molecular components that control stem cell responses to DNA damage remain to be delineated. Using in vivo RNAi screens, we identified basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) as a major component limiting self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in response to telomere dysfunction and γ-irradiation. DNA damage induces BATF in a G-CSF/STAT3-dependent manner resulting in lymphoid differentiation of HSCs. BATF deletion improves HSC self-renewal and function in response to γ-irradiation or telomere shortening but results in accumulation of DNA damage in HSCs. Analysis of bone marrow from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome supports the conclusion that DNA damage-dependent induction of BATF is conserved in human HSCs. Together, these results provide experimental evidence that a BATF-dependent differentiation checkpoint limits self-renewal of HSCs in response to DNA damag.
rk has identified a new subset of CD4(+) T cells named as Tfh cells that are localized in germinal centers and critical in germinal center formation. Tfh cell differentiation is regulated by IL-6 and IL-21, possibly via STAT3 factor, and B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) is specifically expressed in Tfh cells and required for their lineage specification. In the current study, we characterized the role of STAT5 in Tfh cell development. We found that a constitutively active form of STAT5 effectively inhibited Tfh differentiation by suppressing the expression of Tfh-associated factors (CXC motif) receptor 5 (CXCR5), musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-Maf), Bcl6, basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (Batf), and IL-21, and STAT5 deficiency greatly enhanced Tfh gene expression. Importantly, STAT5 regulated the expression of Tfh cell suppressor factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1); STAT5 deficiency impaired Blimp-1 expression and resulted in elevated expression of Tfh-specific genes. Similarly, inhibition of IL-2 potentiated Tfh generation, associated with dampened Blimp-1 expression; Blimp-1 overexpression inhibited Tfh gene expression in Stat5-deficient T cells, suggesting that the IL-2/STAT5 axis functions to regulate Blimp-1 expression. In vivo, deletion of STAT5 in CD4(+) T cells resulted in enhanced development of Tfh cells and germinal center B cells and led to an impairment of B cell tolerance in a well defined mouse tolerance model. Taken together, this study demonstrates that STAT5 controls Tfh differentiatio.
ls play a critical role in protection against viral infections. During effector differentiation, CD8 T cells dramatically change chromatin structure and cellular metabolism, but how energy production increases in response to these epigenetic changes is unknown. We found that loss of basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) inhibited effector CD8 T-cell differentiation. At the late effector stage, BATF was induced by IL-12 and required for IL-12-mediated histone acetylation and survival of effector T cells. BATF, together with c-Jun, transcriptionally inhibited expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase Sirt1, resulting in increased histone acetylation of the T-bet locus and increased cellular NAD(+), which increased ATP production. In turn, high levels of T-bet expression and ATP production promoted effector differentiation and cell survival. These results suggest that BATF promotes effector CD8 T-cell differentiation by regulating both epigenetic remodeling and energy metabolism through Sirt1 expressio.
cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8(+) T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes--such as BATF--that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HI.
y members Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 belong to a class of transcription factors containing basic leucine zipper domains that regulate various immunological functions and control the development and differentiation of immune cells. Functional studies by others demonstrated a predominant role for Batf in controlling Th2 cell functions and lineage development of T lymphocytes as well as a critical role of Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 in CD8α+dendritic cell development. Moreover, Batf family member expression was measured in a vast collection of mouse and human cell types by cap analysis gene expression (CAGE), a recent developed sequencing technology, showing reasonable expression spectrum in immune cells consistent with previously published expression profiles. Batf and Batf3 were highly expressed in lymphocytes and the earlier moderately expressed in myeloid lineages. Batf2 was predominantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages. Functional studies in mice demonstrated that Batf2 has a central role in macrophage activation by regulating inflammatory responses during lipopolysaccharides stimulation and mycobacterial infection. Hence, Batf2 could be used as a biomarker and a potential host directed drug target in tuberculosis. Moreover, Batf2 act as a tumor suppressor gene and augmenting Batf2 in malignant cells might be an encouraging therapeutic treatment against cance.
 NKT (iNKT) cell thymic development can lead to distinct committed effector lineages, namely NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17. However, following identification of IL-9-producing iNKT cells involved in mucosal inflammation, their development remains unaddressed. In this study, we report that although thymic iNKT cells from naive mice do not express IL-9, iNKT cell activation in the presence of TGF-β and IL-4 induces IL-9 secretion in murine and human iNKT cells. Acquisition of IL-9 production was observed in different iNKT subsets defined by CD4, NK1.1, and neuropilin-1, indicating that distinct functional subpopulations are receptive to IL-9 polarization. Transcription factor expression kinetics suggest that regulatory mechanisms of IL-9 expression are shared by iNKT and CD4 T cells, with Irf4 and Batf deficiency deeply affecting IL-9 production. Importantly, adoptive transfer of an enriched IL-9(+) iNKT cell population leads to exacerbated allergic inflammation in the airways upon intranasal immunization with house dust mite, confirming the ability of IL-9-producing iNKT cells to mediate proinflammatory effects in vivo, as previously reported. Taken together, our data show that peripheral iNKT cells retain the capacity of shaping their function in response to environmental cues, namely TGF-β and IL-4, adopting an IL-9-producing NKT cell phenotype able to mediate proinflammatory effects in vivo, namely granulocyte and mast cell recruitment to the lung.
oregulatory functions of vitamin D have been well documented in various immunological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and asthma. IL-10 is considered a chief effector molecule that promotes the vitamin D-induced immunosuppressive states of T cells and accessory cells. In this article, we demonstrate that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), has a profound inhibitory effect on the development of human Th9, a CD4 T cell subset that is highly associated with asthma, in an IL-10-independent manner. Our data show that calcitriol represses the expression of BATF, a transcription factor essential for Th9, via suppressing the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor, without an increase in IL-10. The data show a novel link between vitamin D and two key transcription factors involved in T cell differentiatio.
and different origin of brain myeloid cells in the brain is central to understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) responds to injury. C-type lectin receptor family 9, member A (DNGR-1/CLEC9A) is a marker of specific DC subsets that share functional similarities, such as CD8α(+) DCs in lymphoid tissues and CD103(+) CD11b(low) DCs in peripheral tissues. Here, we analyzed the presence of DNGR-1 in DCs present in the mouse brain (bDCs). Dngr-1/Clec9a mRNA is expressed mainly in the meningeal membranes and choroid plexus (m/Ch), and its expression is enhanced by fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), a cytokine involved in DC homeostasis. Using Clec9a(egfp/egfp) mice, we show that Flt3L induces accumulation of DNGR-1-EGFP(+) cells in the brain m/Ch. Most of these cells also express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules. We also observed an increase in specific markers of cDC CD8α+ cells such as Batf-3 and Irf-8, but not of costimulatory molecules such as Cd80 and Cd86, indicating an immature phenotype for these bDCs in the noninjured brain. The presence of DNGR-1 in the brain provides a potential marker for the study of this specific brain cell subset. Knowledge and targeting of brain antigen presenting cells (APCs) has implications for the fight against brain diseases such as neuroinflammation-based neurodegenerative diseases, microbe-induced encephalitis, and brain tumors such as gliomas.

igate the expression of BATF, a member of the activator protein-1 family, in the renal tissues of mice with lupus nephriti.
 tissues from 24-week-old female MRL/lpr mice and age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 mice were examined for BATF protein expressions using Western blotting and for expressions of BATF, RORγt and IL-17A mRNA using quantitative real-time PCR. The results of laboratory examinations were analyzed in relation with the histopathology of the mic.
ry protein and ds-DNA levels were significantly higher in MRL/lpr mice than in the control mice (P&lt;0.05). Compared to normal control mice, MRL/lpr mice showed obvious glomerular fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrating with significantly increased BATF protein and mRNA expressions (P&lt;0.05) and RORγt and IL-17 mRNA expressions in the renal tissues (P&lt;0.05). In MRL/lpr mice, the expression of BATF mRNA was positively correlated with the RORγt and IL-17A mRNA expressions in the renal tissue.
 expressions of BATF protein and mRNA is increased in MRL/lpr mice. BATF may participate in the immunopathogenesis of lupus nephritis by enhancing Thl7 cell respons.
arr virus (EBV)-associated malignancies, as well as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), obtained in vitro by EBV infection of B cells, express latent viral proteins and maintain their ability to grow indefinitely through inappropriate activation of telomere-specific reverse transcriptase (TERT), the catalytic component of telomerase. Our previous studies demonstrated that high levels of TERT expression in LCLs prevent the activation of EBV lytic cycle, which is instead triggered by TERT silencing. As lytic infection promotes the death of EBV-positive tumor cells, understanding the mechanism(s) by which TERT affects the latent/lytic status of EBV may be important for setting new therapeutic strategies. BATF, a transcription factor activated by NOTCH2, the major NOTCH family member in B cells, negatively affects the expression of BZLF1, the master regulator of viral lytic cycle. We therefore analyzed the interplay between TERT, NOTCH and BATF in LCLs and found that high levels of endogenous TERT are associated with high NOTCH2 and BATF expression levels. In addition, ectopic expression of TERT in LCLs with low levels of endogenous telomerase was associated with upregulation of NOTCH2 and BATF at both mRNA and protein levels. By contrast, infection of LCLs with retroviral vectors expressing functional NOTCH2 did not alter TERT transcript levels. Luciferase reporter assays, demonstrated that TERT significantly activated NOTCH2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that NF-κB pathway is involved in TERT-induced NOTCH2 activation. Lastly, pharmacologic inhibition of NOTCH signaling triggers the EBV lytic cycle, leading to the death of EBV-infected cells. Overall, these results indicate that TERT contributes to preserve EBV latency in B cells mainly through the NOTCH2/BAFT pathway, and suggest that NOTCH2 inhibition may represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against EBV-associated malignancie.
cine zipper transcription factor Batf2 is poorly described, whereas Batf and Batf3 have been shown to play essential roles in dendritic cell, T cell, and B cell development and regulation. Batf2 was drastically induced in IFN-γ-activated classical macrophages (M1) compared with unstimulated or IL-4-activated alternative macrophages (M2). Batf2 knockdown experiments from IFN-γ-activated macrophages and subsequent expression profiling demonstrated important roles for regulation of immune responses, inducing inflammatory and host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, and Nos2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Beijing strain HN878)-infected macrophages further induced Batf2 and augmented host-protective Batf2-dependent genes, particularly in M1, whose mechanism was suggested to be mediated through both TLR2 and TLR4 by LPS and heat-killed HN878 (HKTB) stimulation experiments. Irf1 binding motif was enriched in the promoters of Batf2-regulated genes. Coimmunoprecipitation study demonstrated Batf2 association with Irf1. Furthermore, Irf1 knockdown showed downregulation of IFN-γ- or LPS/HKTB-activated host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, Il12b, and Nos2. Conclusively, Batf2 is an activation marker gene for M1 involved in gene regulation of IFN-γ-activated classical macrophages, as well as LPS/HKTB-induced macrophage stimulation, possibly by Batf2/Irf1 gene induction. Taken together, these results underline the role of Batf2/Irf1 in inducing inflammatory responses in M. tuberculosis infectio.
igate the expression and clinical significance of BATF2 in the oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC.
n of BATF2 mRNA and protein in 16 paired OTSCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor mucosa were examined using quantitative PCR, western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry assays, and the relation between BATF2 expression and clinical pathologic factor and prognosis was analyze.
red tissues, expression of BATF2 mRNA in 13 OTSCC tissues and expression of BATF2 protein in 14 OTSCC tissues were significantly lower than that in adjacent non-tumor mucosa. In 202 paraffin-embedded OTSCC samples, BATF2 was not expressed in 20 cases (9.9%), low expressed in 104 cases (51.5%) and highly expressed in 78 (38.6%). BATF2 expression level was significantly correlated with histological differentiation (P = 0.002). Patients with low BATF2 expression had significantly poorer overall survival and disease-free survival than those with high BATF2 expression (P &lt; 0.001.
 low expressed in OTSCC and related to tumor differentiation and prognosis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for this diseas.
 of protective immunity against pathogenic SIV challenge in SIVΔnef-vaccinated macaques is delayed for 15-20 weeks, a process that is related to qualitative changes in CD8+ T cell responses induced by SIVΔnef. As a novel approach to characterize cell differentiation following vaccination, we used multi-target qPCR to measure transcription factor expression in naïve and memory subsets of CD8++ T cells, and in SIV-specific CD8+ T cells obtained from SIVΔnef-vaccinated or wild type SIVmac239-infected macaques. Unsupervised clustering of expression profiles organized naïve and memory CD8+ T cells into groups concordant with cell surface phenotype. Transcription factor expression patterns in SIV-specific CD8+ T cells in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals were distinct from those observed in purified CD8+ T cell subsets obtained from naïve animals, and were intermediate to expression profiles of purified central memory and effector memory T cells. Expression of transcription factors elicited by SIVΔnef vaccination also varied over time: cells obtained at later time points, temporally associated with greater protection, appeared more central-memory like than cells obtained at earlier time points, which appeared more effector memory-like. Expression of transcription factors associated with effector differentiation, such as ID2 and RUNX3, were decreased over time, while expression of transcription factors associated with quiescence or memory differentiation, such as TCF7, BCOR and EOMES, increased. CD8+ T cells specific for a more conserved epitope expressed higher levels of TBX21 and BATF, and appeared more effector-like than cells specific for an escaped epitope, consistent with continued activation by replicating vaccine virus. These data suggest transcription factor expression profiling is a novel method that can provide additional data complementary to the analysis of memory cell differentiation based on classical phenotypic markers. Additionally, these data support the hypothesis that ongoing stimulation by SIVΔnef promotes a distinct protective balance of CD8+ T cell differentiation and activation state.
oforms are highly regulated in peripheral T cells where they contribute to the effector function and cell homeostasi.
investigated the role of NFATc1 in asthma and in T cell.
ne model of allergic asthma, we analysed differences in T-cell development in this allergic disease model, between wild-type and NFATc1 conditional knockout mice. Thus, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the mRNA expression of Th2-associated genes as well as genes that are involved in IgE immunoglobulin class-switch. Additionally, we used ELISA, Western blot and flow cytometry (FACS) to analyse protein concentrations of Th1-, Th2- and Th17-specific transcription factors and cytokines and the Th2 chemokine, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine/chemokine ligand 17 (TARC/CCL17) by ELIS.
ing NFATc1 in CD4(+) T cells display a significant reduction in lung Th2 and Th17 as well as an increase of Th1 cells in an experimental asthma model. Additionally, Batf gene, a recently described transcription factor of the Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation as well as a key T and B transcription factor involved in the IgE immunoglobulin class-switch, was found decreased in the lungs of these mice. As a consequence, serum OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 levels were found significantly decreased after allergen exposure and in the absence of NFATc1 in T cells in experimental allergic asthm.
 NFATc1 in T lymphocytes ameliorated the allergic trait in the airways of NFATc1(fl/fl) xCD4Cre mice. NFATc1 emerges as a novel target for anti-allergy interventio.
de association studies (GWAS) underscore the genetic basis of multiple sclerosis (MS); however, only few of the newly reported genetic variations relevant in MS have been replicated or correlated for clinical/paraclinical phenotypes such as spinal cord atrophy in independent patient cohorts. We genotyped 141 MS patients for 58 variations reported to reach significance in GWAS. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and disease duration (DD) are available from regular clinical examinations. MRI included sagittal high-resolution 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo of the cervical cord region used for volumetry. Due dependency of mean upper cervical cord area (MUCCA) with EDSS and/or DD, correction operations were performed compensating for EDSS/DD. We assessed each MS risk locus for possible MUCCA association. We identified twelve risk loci that significantly correlated with MUCCA. For nine loci-BATF, CYP27B1, IL12B, NFKB1, IL7, PLEK, EVI5, TAGAP and nrs669607-patients revealed significantly higher degree of atrophy; TYK2, RGS1 and CLEC16A revealed inverse effects. The weighted genetic risk score over the twelve loci showed significant correlation with MUCCA. Our data reveal a risk gene depending paraclinical/clinical phenotype. Since MUCCA clearly correlates with disability, the candidates identified here may serve as prognostic markers for disability progressio.
regulatory T (Treg) cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT-Treg cells) are functionally specialized tissue-resident cells that prevent obesity-associated inflammation and preserve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Their development depends on the transcription factor PPAR-γ; however, the environmental cues required for their differentiation are unknown. Here we show that interleukin 33 (IL-33) signaling through the IL-33 receptor ST2 and myeloid differentiation factor MyD88 is essential for development and maintenance of VAT-Treg cells and sustains their transcriptional signature. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulators BATF and IRF4 were necessary for VAT-Treg differentiation through direct regulation of ST2 and PPAR-γ expression. IL-33 administration induced vigorous population expansion of VAT-Treg cells, which tightly correlated with improvements in metabolic parameters in obese mice. Human omental adipose tissue Treg cells also showed high ST2 expression, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved requirement for IL-33 in VAT-Treg cell homeostasi.
rentiation of effector CD8(+) T cells is critical for the development of protective responses to pathogens and for effective vaccines. In the first few hours after activation, naive CD8(+) T cells initiate a transcriptional program that leads to the formation of effector and memory T cells, but the regulation of this process is poorly understood. Investigating the role of specific transcription factors (TFs) in determining CD8(+) effector T-cell fate by gene knockdown with RNAi is challenging because naive T cells are refractory to transduction with viral vectors without extensive ex vivo stimulation, which obscures the earliest events in effector differentiation. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a novel strategy to test the function of genes in naive CD8(+) T cells in vivo by creating bone marrow chimera from hematopoietic progenitors transduced with an inducible shRNA construct. Following hematopoietic reconstitution, this approach allowed inducible in vivo gene knockdown in any cell type that developed from this transduced progenitor pool. We demonstrated that lentivirus-transduced progenitor cells could reconstitute normal hematopoiesis and develop into naive CD8(+) T cells that were indistinguishable from wild-type naive T cells. This experimental system enabled induction of efficient gene knockdown in vivo without subsequent manipulation. We applied this strategy to show that the TF BATF is essential for initial commitment of naive CD8(+) T cells to effector development but becomes dispensable by 72h. This approach makes possible the study of gene function in vivo in unperturbed cells of hematopoietic origin that are refractory to viral transductio.
arr Virus (EBV) conversion of B-lymphocytes to Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) requires four EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) oncoproteins: EBNA2, EBNALP, EBNA3A, and EBNA3C. EBNA2 and EBNALP associate with EBV and cell enhancers, up-regulate the EBNA promoter, MYC, and EBV Latent infection Membrane Proteins (LMPs), which up-regulate BCL2 to protect EBV-infected B-cells from MYC proliferation-induced cell death. LCL proliferation induces p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF)-mediated cell senescence. EBNA3A and EBNA3C jointly suppress p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), enabling continuous cell proliferation. Analyses of the EBNA3A human genome-wide ChIP-seq landscape revealed 37% of 10,000 EBNA3A sites to be at strong enhancers; 28% to be at weak enhancers; 4.4% to be at active promoters; and 6.9% to be at weak and poised promoters. EBNA3A colocalized with BATF-IRF4, ETS-IRF4, RUNX3, and other B-cell Transcription Factors (TFs). EBNA3A sites clustered into seven unique groups, with differing B-cell TFs and epigenetic marks. EBNA3A coincidence with BATF-IRF4 or RUNX3 was associated with stronger EBNA3A ChIP-Seq signals. EBNA3A was at MYC, CDKN2A/B, CCND2, CXCL9/10, and BCL2, together with RUNX3, BATF, IRF4, and SPI1. ChIP-re-ChIP revealed complexes of EBNA3A on DNA with BATF. These data strongly support a model in which EBNA3A is tethered to DNA through a BATF-containing protein complexes to enable continuous cell proliferatio.
escribe increased expression of IL6R in the tumoural region of lung tissue from patients affected by lung adenocarcinoma as compared to squamous cell lung carcinoma. Moreover, here we found increased IL6R in the tumour free part of the lung. By using a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma, we discovered that few lung tumour cells expressed IL-6R and CD4+CD25+Foxp-3+ T regulatory cells down-regulated IL-6R in the tumour bearing lungs. Downstream of IL-6R, the Th17 lineage-specification factors: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Basic leucine zipper transcription factor, BATF and a protein encoded by the RORC in human (RAR-related orphan receptor C) (RORγT), were also found induced in the tumoural region of lung tissue from patients affected by lung adenocarcinoma as compared to those carrying squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, pSTAT3 protein was found phosphorylated and auto-phosphorylated in the tumoural region of patients with adeno cell carcinoma of the lung as compared to the tumoural region of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Intranasal application of anti-IL-6R antibodies in a murine model of lung adenocarcinoma, induced T regulatory cell markers such as Foxp3, Ctla4, Icos, Il10, Il21, Folr4 and Lag3 and inhibited Rorc in lung adenocarcinom.
ocyte-specific transcription factor Interferon (IFN) Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) is implicated in certain types of lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its interactions with these malignancies are largely unknown. In this study, we have first profiled molecular signatures associated with IRF4 expression in associated cancers, by analyzing existing gene expression profiling datasets. Our results show that IRF4 is overexpressed in melanoma, in addition to previously reported contexts including leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma, and that IRF4 is associated with a unique gene expression pattern in each context. A pool of important genes involved in B-cell development, oncogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and cell death including BATF, LIMD1, CFLAR, PIM2, and CCND2 are common signatures associated with IRF4 in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. We confirmed the correlation of IRF4 with LIMD1 and CFLAR in a panel of cell lines derived from lymphomas. Moreover, we profiled the IRF4 transcriptome in the context of EBV latent infection, and confirmed several genes including IFI27, IFI44, GBP1, and ARHGAP18, as well as CFLAR as novel targets for IRF4. These results provide valuable information for understanding the IRF4 regulatory network, and improve our knowledge of the unique roles of IRF4 in different hematological malignancie.
ranscription factor Batf3 is required for homeostatic development of CD8α(+) classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell responses against intracellular pathogens. Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for CD8α(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-γ. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally, physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably, manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of value in augmenting immune responses to vaccine.
F2, a basic leucine zipper protein, was recently detected in several normal immortalized cell lines but not in transformed cell lines. In addition, the expression of BATF2 also slowed the growth rate of malignant tumor cells injected into athymic nude mice. In this study, to study the role of BATF2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we examined BATF2 expression in 50 paired HCC tumorous and nontumorous tissues, as well as in five HCC cell lines. Moreover, BATF2 expression in 114 HCC patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis was investigated. We found that BATF2 expression was significantly reduced in most HCC tumorous tissues, when compared with nontumorous tissues, as well as in the five HCC cell lines. Consistent with these results, the immunohistochemistry revealed that decreased BATF2 expression was present in 63 of the 114 cases and was significantly correlated with age (p = 0.006), tumor size (p = 0.046) and tumor differentiation (p = 0.030). Patients with negative BATF2 expression showed a shorter survival than those with positive expression (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis revealed that BATF2 expression was an independent predictor of overall survival (p = 0.015). All the data support the hypothesis that BATF2 plays an important role in the progression of HCC and that it may work as a candidate tumor suppressor and a prognostic marker as well as a potential target for treatmen.
bryonic development requires a fine-tuned control of gene expression, which is achieved in part through the activity of transcription coactivators or corepressors. The nuclear coactivator cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CREBBP or CBP) interacts with numerous transcription factors and thereby plays a key role in various signaling pathways. Interestingly, in cell-based studies CREBBP activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as methylation on arginine residues which is catalyzed by coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). However, whether and where CREBBP, and in particular its methylated forms, are expressed during development in vertebrates has not been addressed so far. Here, we analyzed the expression of the two crebbp genes (crebbpa &amp; crebbpb) during zebrafish development using both RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization. We found that while crebbpa expression is higher in posterior, caudal nascent somites during somitogenesis, crebbpb accumulates in anterior, rostral, and more mature somites. In addition, crebbpa mRNA is enriched in the central myotome at 24 hpf indicating that its expression is spatially and temporally controlled. We next characterized the expression of CREBBP protein from blastula to gastrula stages by immunohistochemistry. We found that while CREBBP is clearly cytoplasmic in the early blastula, it becomes both cytoplasmic and nuclear at 30% epiboly before turning mainly nuclear during gastrulation. Of interest, CREBBP methylated species appear to be mainly nuclear from 30% epiboly to 6-somite stage. This suggests that methylation may regulate CREBBP import to the nucleus during zebrafish development and could therefore participate in the control of early developmental processe.
ughput sequencing technologies are widely used to analyse genomic variants or rare mutational events in different fields of genomic research, with a fast development of new or adapted platforms and technologies, enabling amplicon-based analysis of single target genes or even whole genome sequencing within a short period of time. Each sequencing platform is characterized by well-defined types of errors, resulting from different steps in the sequencing workflow. Here we describe a universal method to prepare amplicon libraries that can be used for sequencing on different high-throughput sequencing platforms. We have sequenced distinct exons of the CREB binding protein (CREBBP) gene and analysed the output resulting from three major deep-sequencing platforms. platform-specific errors were adjusted according to the result of sequence analysis from the remaining platforms. Additionally, bioinformatic methods are described to determine platform dependent errors. Summarizing the results we present a platform-independent cost-efficient and timesaving method that can be used as an alternative to commercially available sample-preparation kit.
ed that brain (pro)renin receptor (PRR) expression levels are elevated in DOCA-salt-induced hypertension; however, the underlying mechanism remained unknown. To address whether ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling is involved in this regulation, we implanted a DOCA pellet and supplied 0.9% saline as the drinking solution to C57BL/6J mice. Sham pellet-implanted mice that were provided regular drinking water served as controls. Concurrently, mice were intracerebroventricularly infused with the AT1R blocker losartan, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor captopril, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 3 wk. Intracerebroventricular infusion of losartan or captopril attenuated DOCA-salt-induced PRR mRNA elevation in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, suggesting a role for ANG II/AT1R signaling in regulating PRR expression during DOCA-salt hypertension. To test which ANG II/AT1R downstream transcription factors were involved in PRR regulation, we treated Neuro-2A cells with ANG II with or without CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) or AP-1 (activator protein-1) inhibitors, or CREB siRNA. CREB and AP-1 inhibitors, as well as CREB knockdown abolished ANG II-induced increases in PRR levels. ANG II also induced PRR upregulation in primary cultured neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that ANG II treatment increased CREB binding to the endogenous PRR promoter in both cultured neurons and hypothalamic tissues of DOCA-salt hypertensive mice. This increase in CREB activity was reversed by AT1R blockade. Collectively, these findings indicate that ANG II acts via AT1R to upregulate PRR expression both in cultured cells and in DOCA-salt hypertensive mice by increasing CREB binding to the PRR promote.
l squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. However, although genomic studies have identified some mutations associated with ESCC, we know little of the mutational processes responsible. To identify genome-wide mutational signatures, we performed either whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 104 ESCC individuals and combined our data with those of 88 previously reported samples. An APOBEC-mediated mutational signature in 47% of 192 tumors suggests that APOBEC-catalyzed deamination provides a source of DNA damage in ESCC. Moreover, PIK3CA hotspot mutations (c.1624G&gt;A [p.Glu542Lys] and c.1633G&gt;A [p.Glu545Lys]) were enriched in APOBEC-signature tumors, and no smoking-associated signature was observed in ESCC. In the samples analyzed by WGS, we identified focal (&lt;100 kb) amplifications of CBX4 and CBX8. In our combined cohort, we identified frequent inactivating mutations in AJUBA, ZNF750, and PTCH1 and the chromatin-remodeling genes CREBBP and BAP1, in addition to known mutations. Functional analyses suggest roles for several genes (CBX4, CBX8, AJUBA, and ZNF750) in ESCC. Notably, high activity of hedgehog signaling and the PI3K pathway in approximately 60% of 104 ESCC tumors indicates&nbsp;that therapies targeting these pathways might be particularly promising strategies for ESCC. Collectively, our data provide comprehensive insights into the mutational signatures of ESCC and identify markers for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic target.
impairment of adaptive immune response has been observed in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with reduced expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg) and enhanced effector T-cell responsiveness, both associated with poorer outcome.
y investigated the mechanisms underlying T-cell dysregulation in AC.
ted both early and downstream T-cell receptor activation pathways after ex&nbsp;vivo stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 crosslink in CD4(+) T cells from 20 patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), 20 with stable angina (SA), and 20 controls. We reassessed 10 NSTEMI and 10 SA patients after 1 yea.
low analysis revealed reduced phosphorylation of the zeta-chain-associated protein kinase of 70&nbsp;kDa at the inhibitory residue tyrosine 292, enhancing T-cell activation, in NSTEMI helper T cells versus SA and controls (each, p&nbsp;&lt; 0.001), resulting from increased expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type, 22 (PTPN22) (p&nbsp;&lt; 0.001 for both comparisons), persisting at follow-up. We also observed reduced phosphorylation (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001 versus controls) and lower levels of binding to interleukins 2 and 10 core promoter regions of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) in NSTEMI (p&nbsp;&lt; 0.05 vs. controls), which recovered at 1 year. Finally, in NSTEMI patients, helper T cells had a reduced ability in T-cell receptor-induced Treg generation (p&nbsp;= 0.002 vs. SA; p&nbsp;= 0.001 vs. controls), partially recovered at 1 year. Restoring CREB activity and silencing PTPN22 enhanced NSTEMI patients' ability to generate Tre.
stent overexpression of PTPN22 and the transient reduction of CREB activity, associated with impaired Treg differentiation, might play a role in AC.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare, clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and several multiple congenital anomalies. The syndrome is caused by almost private point mutations in the CREBBP (~55% of cases) and EP300 (~8%) genes. The CREBBP mutational spectrum is variegated and characterized by point mutations (30-50 %) and deletions (~10%). The latter are diverse in size and genomic position and remove either the whole CREBBP gene and its flanking regions or only an intragenic portion. Here, we report 14 novel CREBBP deletions ranging from single exons to the whole gene and flanking regions which were identified by applying complementary cytomolecular techniques: fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and array comparative genome hybridization, to a large cohort of RSTS patients. Deletions involving CREBBP account for 23% of our detected CREBBP mutations, making an important contribution to the mutational spectrum. Genotype-phenotype correlations revealed that patients with CREBBP deletions extending beyond this gene did not always have a more severe phenotype than patients harboring CREBBP point mutations, suggesting that neighboring genes play only a limited role in the etiopathogenesis of CREBBP-centerd contiguous gene syndrome. Accordingly, the extent of the deletion is not predictive of the severity of the clinical phenotyp.
r lymphoma (FL) is incurable with conventional therapies and has a clinical course typified by multiple relapses after therapy. These tumors are genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96% of FL tumors and two or more in 76% of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased antigen presentatio.
tand the anti-inflammaging effect of lactic acid bacteria, we selected NF-κB activation-inhibitory Lactobacillus pentosus var. plantarum C29 and investigated its memory-enhancing and anti-inflammatory effects in aged Fischer 344 rats. C29 (2 × 10(9) CFU rat(-1) ), which was orally administered once a day (6 days per week) for 8 weeks, significantly restored age-reduced spontaneous alternation to 95.2% of that seen in young rats (P &lt; 0.05). C29 treatment also shortened the escape latency on the 4th day to 53.8% of that seen in young rats (P &lt; 0.05). Twenty hours after the last training session, C29 significantly increased the swimming time within the platform quadrant, which was shortened in the aged control rats. Oral administration of C29 restored age-reduced doublecortin (DCX) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activation in aged rats. Treatment of aged rats with C29 suppressed the expression of p16, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, as well as the activation of Akt, mTOR, and NF-κB in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that C29 ameliorates ageing-dependent memory impairment by inhibiting NF-κB signalling pathway, inducing DCX and BDNF expression and activating CRE.
inflammatory Lactobacillus pentosus var. plantarum C29 had the memory-enhancing effect in aged Fischer 344 rats by restoring doublecortin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and suppressing p16 expression and NF-κB activation in the brain. Therefore, C29 may be useful in ameliorating age-related degenerative dementi.
ding the mechanism of action of the yessotoxin (YTX) is crucial since this drug has potential pharmacological effects in allergic processes, tumor proliferation and neurodegenerative diseases. It has been described that YTX activates apoptosis after 24h of treatment, while after 48 h of incubation with the toxin a decrease in cell viability corresponding to cellular differentiation or non-apoptotic cell death was observed. In this paper, these processes were extensively studied by using the erythroleukemia K-562 cell line. On one hand, events of K-562 cell differentiation into erythrocytes after YTX treatment were studied using hemin as positive control of cell differentiation. Cell differentiation was studied through the cyclic nucleotide response element binding (phospho-CREB) and the transferrin receptor (TfR) expression. On the other hand, using rapamycin as positive control, autophagic hallmarks, as non-apoptotic cell death, were studied after toxin exposure. In this case, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and light chain 3B (LC3B) levels were measured to check autophagy activation. The results showed that cell differentiation was not occurring after 48 h of toxin incubation while at this time the autophagy was triggered. Furthermore after 24h of toxin treatment none of these processes were activated. In addition, the role of the type 4A phosphodiesterase (PDE4A), the intracellular target of YTX, was checked. PDE4A-silencing experiments showed different regulation steps of PDE4A in the autophagic processes triggered either by traditional compounds or YTX. In summary, after 48 h YTX treatment PDE4A-dependent autophagy, as non-apoptotic programmed cell death, is activate.
ated kinase 4 (PAK4) regulates a wide range of cellular events, including cytoskeletal remodeling, cell growth, and survival. Our previous study identified PAK4 as a key regulator of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) that acts upstream of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a master transcription factor in melanogenesis. We therefore investigated the role of PAK4 in melanogenesis. Melanocytes express both PAK2 and PAK4 isoforms, but only RNA interference knockdown of PAK4 significantly influenced α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells. Consistent with this result, PAK4 inhibition by PF3758309, a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of PAKs, suppressed not only α-MSH-induced melanogenesis in B16 melanoma and human epithelial melanocyte cells but also UVB-induced melanogenesis in the skin of melanin-possessing hairless mice (HRM-2) in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of PAK4 over several days markedly decreased the levels of CREB, MITF, and tyrosinase in both HRM-2 mice and B16 melanoma cells. Moreover, PAK4 knockdown and inhibition suppressed α-MSH-stimulated β-catenin phosphorylation at serine 675 (S675) but enhanced phosphorylation at S33/37, an indicator for ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis. Together, our results provide evidence that PAK4 promotes α-MSH/UVB-induced melanogenesis via the CREB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and suggest that PAK4 may be a potential therapeutic target in pigmentation disorder.
corticoid receptor (GR) N-terminal domain (NTD) contains a transactivation domain (activation function 1; AF-1). GR AF-1 is phosphorylated, but effects of this modification upon AF-1 activity and cofactor recruitment are not completely clear. GR AF-1 activity is mostly confined to a short unstructured domain called tau1c (amino acids 187-244) that contains three phosphorylation sites and binds a short cysteine rich fragment (CH3) of the coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP). Since the CH3 domain overlaps the CBP transcriptional adaptor zinc binding (TAZ) 2 domain, implicated in phosphorylation dependent binding to other unstructured transcription factor domains, we set out to investigate whether GR interacts with TAZ2 and whether this binding event is modulated by phosphorylation. We find that GR tau1c is absolutely required for enhancement of GR function and GR/CBP association in cultured cells. Tau1c interacts with TAZ2 in vitro and peptide mapping reveals CBP binding determinants throughout tau1c. Phosphorylation at GR Ser203, not involved in transactivation, does not affect tau1c/TAZ2 interactions. However, phosphorylation at Ser211 and Ser226, markers of GR transcriptional activity, greatly enhances TAZ2 binding in a synergistic fashion. We propose that GR tau1c phosphorylation could promote CBP recruitment and enhance AF-1 activit.
a remains a devastating complication of complex aortic surgery. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to prevent paraplegia after ischemia reperfusion, but the protective mechanism remains poorly described in the spinal cord. We hypothesized that EPO induces the CREB (cAMP [adenosine 3'5' cyclic monophosphate] response element-binding protein) pathway and neurotrophin production in the murine spinal cord, attenuating functional and cellular injur.
e mice were subjected to 4 minutes of spinal cord ischemia via an aortic and left subclavian cross-clamp. Experimental groups included EPO treatment 4 hours before incision (n = 7), ischemic control (n = 7), and shams (n = 4). Hind-limb function was assessed using the Basso motor score for 48 hours after reperfusion. Spinal cords were harvested and analyzed for neuronal viability using histology and staining with a fluorescein derivative. Expression of phosphorylated (p)AKT (a serine/threonine-specific kinase), pCREB, B-cell lymphoma 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were determined using immunoblottin.
rs of reperfusion, EPO significantly preserved hind-limb function after ischemia-reperfusion injury (P &lt; .01). Histology demonstrated preserved cytoarchitecture in the EPO treatment group. Cords treated with EPO expressed significant increases in pAKT (P = .021) and pCREB (P = .038). Treatment with EPO induced expression of both of the neurotrophins, B-cell lymphoma 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, beginning at 12 hour.
ietin-mediated induction of the CREB pathway and production of neurotrophins is associated with improved neurologic function and increased neuronal viability following spinal cord ischemia reperfusion. Further elucidation of EPO-derived neuroprotection will allow for expansion of adjunct mechanisms for spinal cord protection in high-risk thoracoabdominal aortic interventio.
igate the clinical and genetic features of 2 patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrom.
t generation sequencing (NGS) the CREBBP and EP300 genes of 2 children who were diagnosed as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The mutations identified by NGS were verified by PCR were analyze.
ients at the age of 5 months and 4.5 years manifested short stature (the height were 60 cm and 99 cm respectively), low hairline, thick and dense hair and eyebrows, long lash, epicanthus of both eyes, protruded supercilliary arch, broad and flat thumbs and halluces, and particular facial abnormalities. Patient 2 had language retardation besides. One missense mutation of c.3535A&gt;G, p.Ser1179Gly was found in CREBBP gene in patient 1 and one microdeletion mutation of c.4995_4999delCGCCT, p. Ala1666Pro fs66x was found inpatient 2. Both mutations were reported for the first tim.
n-Taybi syndrome is characterized by mental and growth retardation, wide and flat thumbs and first toes, and dysmorphic facial features. CREBBP is one of the causative genes. Mutation detection on CREBBP gene can confirm the diagnosis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrom.
ns in cytoarchitecture and molecular signaling have been observed in adaptive and maladaptive responses to stress and presumably underlie the physiological and behavioral changes observed. The relationship between behavioral responses to stress exposure and changes in cytoarchitecture of subregions of the hippocampus and amygdala was investigated in an animal model of PTSD. Behaviors in elevated plus-maze and acoustic startle response tests were assessed in rats 7 days after exposure to predator scent stress. Brains were harvested 24h later. Neurons from CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus subregions and basolateral amygdala were reconstructed and subjected to Sholl analysis and spine density estimation. Glucocorticoid receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phospho-NR1-Ser-889, phospho-GluR1-Ser-845, phospho-calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II-Thy-286, post-synaptic density protein 95 and phospho-CREB-Ser-133 were evaluated in the hippocampus. Data were analyzed by retrospective classification of individual rats into three behavioral response groups. The extent and distribution of changes in the morphology of hippocampal and amygdalar dendrites was significantly associated with stress-induced behavioral response classification. Extreme (PTSD-like) behavioral disruption was associated with extensive neuronal retraction in the hippocampus and proliferation in the amygdala. Neither structure displayed such changes in minimal behavioral responders. Partial behavioral response was associated with identical changes in the hippocampus only. Patterns of change in requisite molecular signaling genes and endophenotypic markers corresponded to the structural and behavioral responses. The extent and distribution of changes in the cytoarchitecture of hippocampal and amygdalar subregions is directly related to the pattern of behavioral response of the individual to stress exposur.
ic basis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a rare, sporadic, clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by cognitive impairment and a wide spectrum of multiple congenital anomalies, is primarily due to private mutations in CREBBP (approximately 55% of cases) or EP300 (approximately 8% of cases). Herein, we report the clinical and the genetic data taken from a cohort of 46 RSTS patients, all carriers of CREBBP point mutations. Molecular analysis revealed 45 different gene alterations including 31 inactivating (21 frameshift and 10 nonsense), 10 missense and 4 splicing mutations. Bioinformatic tools and transcript analyses were used to predict the functional effects of missense and splicing alterations. Of the 45 mutations, 42 are unreported and 3 were described previously. Recurrent mutations maybe a key tool in addressing genotype-phenotype correlations in patients sharing the same defects (at the genomic or transcript level) and specific clinical signs, demonstrated here in two cases. The clinical data of our cohort evidenced frequent signs such as arched eyebrows, epicanthus, synophrys and/or frontal hypertrichosis and broad phalanges that, previously overlooked in RSTS diagnosis, now could be considered. Some suggested correlations between organ-specific anomalies and affected CREB-binding protein domains broaden the RSTS clinical spectrum and perhaps will enhance patient follow-up and clinical car.
cently been proposed that extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are one of the factors mediating seizure development. We hypothesized that inhibition of ERK1/2 activity could prevent audiogenic seizures by altering GABA and glutamate release mechanisms. Krushinsky-Molodkina rats, genetically prone to audiogenic seizure, were recruited in the experiments. Animals were i.p. injected with an inhibitor of ERK1/2 SL 327 at different doses 60 min before audio stimulation. We demonstrated for the first time that inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by SL 327 injections prevented seizure behavior and this effect was dose-dependent and correlated with ERK1/2 activity. The obtained data also demonstrated unchanged levels of GABA production, and an increase in the level of vesicular glutamate transporter 2. The study of exocytosis protein expression showed that SL 327 treatment leads to downregulation of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 and synapsin I, and accumulation of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25). The obtained data indicate that the inhibition of ERK1/2 blocks seizure behavior presumably by altering the exocytosis machinery, and identifies ERK1/2 as a potential target for the development of new strategies for seizure treatment. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are one of the factors mediating seizure development. Here we report that inhibition of ERK1/2 by SL 327 prevented seizure behavior and this effect was dose-dependent and correlated with ERK1/2 activity. Accumulation of VGLUT2 was associated with differential changing of synaptic proteins VAMP2, SNAP-25 and synapsin I. The obtained data indicate that the inhibition of ERK1/2 alters neurotransmitter release by changing the exocytosis machinery, thus preventing seizure.
ng how histone acetylation is regulated is vital for treating the many diseases associated with its misregulation, including heart disease, neurological disorders, and cancer. We have previously reported that acetyl-CoA levels alter p300 histone acetylation in a site-specific manner in vitro. Here, we further investigate how changing acetyl-CoA concentrations alter the histone acetylation pattern by altering p300 specificity. Interestingly, these changes are not a simple global change in acetylation, but rather site specific changes, whereby acetylation at some sites increase while others decrease. We also demonstrate how the p300 inhibitor C646 can pharmacologically alter p300 histone acetylation patterns in vitro and in cells. This study provides insight into the mechanisms regulating p300 residue specificity, a potential means for altering p300 dependent histone acetylation, and an investigation into altering histone acetylation patterns in cell.
xchange molecular dynamics simulations are performed on the protein complex pKID-KIX to understand the effects of macromolecular crowding on coupled folding and binding events. A structure-based protein model at the residue level is adopted for the two proteins to include intramolecular conformational flexibility, while crowding macromolecules are represented as spherical particles. The interactions between crowders and protein residues can be either purely repulsive or a combination of short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction. Consistent with previous studies on rigid-body protein binding in the presence of spherical crowders, we find that the complex formation is stabilized by repulsive protein-crowder interactions and destabilized by sufficiently strong attractive protein-crowder interactions. Competition between stabilizing repulsive and destabilizing attractive interactions is quantitatively captured by a previous theoretical model developed for describing the change in the binding free energy of rigid proteins in a crowded environment. We find that protein flexibility has little effect on the thermodynamics of the pKID-KIX binding (with respect to bulk) for repulsive and weakly attractive protein-crowder interactions. For strong protein-crowder attractive interactions, the destabilizing effect due to crowding is attenuated by protein flexibility. Interestingly, the mechanism of coupled folding and binding observed in bulk remains unchanged under highly crowded conditions over a broad range of protein-crowder interaction strengths. Also, strong protein-crowder attractive interactions can significantly stabilize intermediate states involving partial contact between pKID and KIX domain.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is one of the neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations of epigenetic genes. The CREBBP gene is the most common causative gene, encoding the CREB-binding protein with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, an epigenetic modulator. To date, there have been few reports on the structural abnormalities of the brain in RSTS patients. In addition, there are no reports on the analysis of CREBBP mutations in Korean RSTS patient.
med mutational analyses on 16 unrelated patients with RSTS, with diagnosis based on the typical clinical features. Their medical records and brain MRI images were reviewed retrospectivel.
 patients (62.5%) had mutations in the CREBBP gene. The mutations included five frameshift mutations (31.2%), two nonsense mutations (12.5%), and three multiexon deletions (18.8%). There were no remarkable significant differences in the clinical features between those with and without a CREBBP mutation, although brain MRI abnormalities were more frequently observed in those with a CREBBP mutation. Seven of 10 patients in whom brain imaging was performed had structural abnormalities, including Chiari malformation type 1, thinning of the corpus callosum, and delayed myelination. There were no differences in delayed development or cognitive impairment between those with and without abnormal brain images, while epilepsy was involved in two patients who had abnormalities on brain MRI image.
igated the spectrum of CREBBP mutations in Korean patients with RSTS for the first time. Eight novel mutations extended the genetic spectrum of CREBBP mutations in RSTS patients. This is also the first study showing the prevalence and spectrum of abnormalities on brain MRI in RSTS patient.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare congenital neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by postnatal growth deficiency, skeletal abnormalities, dysmorphic features and cognitive deficit. Mutations in two genes, CREBBP and EP300, encoding two homologous transcriptional co-activators, have been identified in ˜55% and ˜3-5% of affected individuals, respectively. To date, only eight EP300-mutated RSTS patients have been described and 12 additional mutations are reported in the database LOVD. In this study, EP300 analysis was performed on 33 CREBBP-negative RSTS patients leading to the identification of six unreported germline EP300 alterations comprising one deletion and five point mutations. All six patients showed a convincing, albeit mild, RSTS phenotype with minor skeletal anomalies, slight cognitive impairment and few major malformations. Beyond the expansion of the RSTS-EP300-mutated cohort, this study indicates that EP300-related RSTS cases occur more frequently than previously thought (˜8% vs 3-5%); furthermore, the characterization of novel EP300 mutations in RSTS patients will enhance the clinical practice and genotype-phenotype correlation.
n-Taybi syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with multiple congenital anomalies and genetic heterogeneity. Clinical manifestations include mental retardation, postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, broad thumbs and halluces, and characteristic facial features. Mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CREBBP; OMIM 600140) on chromosome 16p13, account for about 50% to 70% of patients. Most of CREBBP mutations are de novo and the rate of recurrence in a family is low. Families with several affected children are extremely rare. We report here a Moroccan family with two children with RSTS and apparently unaffected parents. The molecular studies showed a heterozygous mutation c.4361T&gt;A (p.Leu1454His) in exon 26 of the CREBBP gene in the two affected siblings. Neither the parents, nor the healthy brother, carry this mutation in hematologic cells. The mutation was also absent in buccal epithelial cells of both parents. We discuss the hypothesis of germinal mosaicism. This concept is very important because it complicates genetic counseling of this family who has a risk of recurrence of the mutation in subsequent pregnancie.
 a girl with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) who was found to have copy number loss on 16p13.3 by array-CGH. She has developmental delay and other features of RSTS including downslanting palpebral fissures, a prominent nose with the nasal septum extending below the alae nasi, broad thumbs and big toes, postaxial polydactyly of the right foot and constipation from birth. We report the junction sequence across the breakpoint region for a microdeletion in RSTS. The sequencing results also showed that the deletion was 81.4kb involving three genes DNASE 1, TRAP 1, and CREBB.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder defined by postnatal growth deficiency, characteristic skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation and caused by mutations in the genes encoding for the transcriptional co-activators with intrinsic lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity CBP and p300. Previous studies have shown that neuronal histone acetylation is reduced in mouse models of RST.
rs identified different mutations at the CREBBP locus and generated lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from nine patients with RSTS carrying distinct CREBBP mutations that illustrate different grades of the clinical severity in the spectrum of the syndrome. They next assessed whether histone acetylation levels were altered in these cell line.
rison of CREBBP-mutated RSTS cell lines with cell lines derived from patients with an unrelated mental retardation syndrome or healthy controls revealed significant deficits in histone acetylation, affecting primarily histone H2B and histone H2A. The most severe defects were observed in the lines carrying the whole deletion of the CREBBP gene and the truncating mutation, both leading to a haploinsufficiency state. Interestingly, this deficit was rescued by treatment with an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACi.
rs' results extend to humans the seminal observations in RSTS mouse models and point to histone acetylation defects, mainly involving H2B and H2A, as relevant molecular markers of the diseas.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is an inheritable disease associated with mutations in the gene encoding the CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) and characterized by growth impairment, learning disabilities, and distinctive facial and skeletal features. Studies in mouse models for RSTS first suggested a direct role for CBP and histone acetylation in cognition and memory. Here, we took advantage of the genetic tools for generating mice in which the CBP gene is specifically deleted in postmitotic principal neurons of the forebrain to investigate the consequences of the loss of CBP in the adult brain. In contrast to the conventional CBP knock-out mice, which exhibit very early embryonic lethality, postnatal forebrain-restricted CBP mutants were viable and displayed no overt abnormalities. We identified the dimer of histones H2A and H2B as the preferred substrate of the histone acetyltransferase domain of CBP. Surprisingly, the loss of CBP and subsequent histone hypoacetylation had a very modest impact in the expression of a number of immediate early genes and did not affect neuronal viability. In addition, the behavioral characterization of these mice dissociated embryonic and postnatal deficits caused by impaired CBP function, narrowed down the anatomical substrate of specific behavioral defects, and confirmed the special sensitivity of object recognition memory to CBP deficiency. Overall, our study provides novel insights into RSTS etiology and clarifies some of the standing questions concerning the role of CBP and histone acetylation in activity-driven gene expression, memory formation, and neurodegeneratio.
trate the utility of an exon coverage microarray platform in detecting intragenic deletions: one in exons 24-27 of the EP300 gene and another in exons 27 and 28 of the CREBBP gene in two patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS). RSTS is a heterogeneous disorder in which approximately 45-55% of cases result from deletion or mutations in the CREBBP gene and an unknown portion of cases result from gene changes in EP300. The first case is a 3-year-old female with an exonic deletion of the EP300 gene who has classic facial features of RSTS without the thumb and great toe anomalies, consistent with the milder skeletal phenotype that has been described in other RSTS cases with EP300 mutations. In addition, the mother of this patient also had preeclampsia during pregnancy, which has been infrequently reported. The second case is a newborn male who has the classical features of RSTS. Our results illustrate that exon-targeted array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a powerful tool for detecting clinically significant intragenic rearrangements that would be otherwise missed by aCGH platforms lacking sufficient exonic coverage or sequencing of the gene of interes.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a developmental disorder comprising abnormalities that include mental retardation, an unusual facial appearance, broad thumbs and big toes is frequently associated with molecular lesions in the CREB-binding protein gene, CREBBP. The objective of the present study was to identify and analyse CREBBP mutations in Indian RSTS patients on which there are no data. Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots in which ten novel pathogenic mutations were localized. Functional analysis revealed that three of these mutations affecting amino acids Glu1459, Leu1668 and Glu1724 were critical for histone acetyltransferase activity. Twenty-eight novel CREBBP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also identified in the Indian population. Linkage disequilibrium studies revealed associations between (i) SNP (rs129974/c.3836-206G greater than C) and mutation (p.Asp1340Ala); (ii) (rs130002) with mutation (p.Asn435Lys) and (iii) SNPs rs129974, rs130002 and SNP (c.3836-206G greater than C) signifying a disease affection status. In conclusion, the present study reports the highest detection rate of CREBBP mutations (76.9%) in RSTS patients to date, of which ten are predicted to be pathogenic and three critical for histone acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, identification of the association of CREBBP polymorphisms with disease susceptibility could be an important risk factor for the pathogenesis of RST.
 inactivation of the CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) a transcriptional co-activator produces an embryonic lethal phenotype in mice. In humans, re-arrangements in CREBBP are associated with the Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS) that is characterised by craniofacial, skeletal and neuronal symptoms. Neuronal defects in RSTS can be attributed to genetic re-arrangements in CREBBP, which has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. The present study was designed to investigate the role of CREBBP re-arrangements during neuronal differentiation. Towards this, deletion constructs of pCREBBP, viz. pDeltaCB-HAT and pDeltaHAT-CT were generated and transfected into NT2 cells. Expression profiling of the components of Notch, Wnt, SHH and Retinoid signaling along with screening of the neuronal markers was carried out in the NT2 cells and their mutant derivatives. ChIP-PCRs along with co-immunoprecipitations were also performed in these cells to investigate defects due to inappropriate interaction of mutated CREEBP with the corresponding transcription factor and other transcription regulatory proteins both at steady state as well as during differentiation. Mutant NT2 cells lacking the CREB, BROMO and HAT domains (CB-HAT) were highly proliferative and showed limited differentiation; while mutant NT2 cells expressing CREBBP lacking the HAT and CTAD domains (HAT-CT) are proliferation deficient and differentiate rapidly albeit generating an insufficient number of neurons. Altered CREBBP structure resulted in changes in HAT activity, cell cycle profiles and expression of basal levels of components of Notch, SHH, Wnt and retinoid pathways known to be critical in the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors. At the chromatin level, aberrant signaling correlated with altered binding affinities of the (CREBBP-transcription factor) complexes to promoter regions of components of these pathways. Thus, differentiation defects are manifested early at the genomic level leading to aberrant transcription of the genes involved in differentiation along the neuronal lineag.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterised by facial dysmorphisms, growth and psychomotor development delay, and skeletal defects. The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300 regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven imbalances (27%): four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported among the copy number variants. A de novo 7p21.1 deletion of 500 kb included the TWIST1 gene, a suggested candidate for RSTS that is responsible for the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an entity that enters in differential diagnosis with RSTS. A similar issue of differential diagnosis was raised by a large 4.3 Mb 2q22.3q23.1 deletion encompassing ZEB2, the gene responsible for the Mowat-Wilson syndrome, whose signs may overlap with RSTS. Positional candidate genes could not be sought in the remaining pathogenetic imbalances, because of the size of the involved region (a 9 Mb 2q24.3q31.1 deletion) and/or the relative paucity of suitable genes (a 5 Mb 3p13p12.3 duplication). One of the inherited rearrangements, the 17q11.2 379Kb duplication, represents the reciprocal event of the deletion underlying an overgrowth syndrome, both being mediated by the NF1-REP-P1 and REP-P2 sub-duplicons. The contribution of this and the other detected CNVs to the clinical RSTS phenotype is difficult to asses.
n-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS, OMIM 180849) is a rare condition, which in 65% of cases is caused by haploinsufficiency of CREBBP (cAMP response element binding protein binding protein) localized to 16p13.3. A small subset of RSTS cases caused by 16p13.3 microdeletions involving neighboring genes have been recently suggested to be a true contiguous gene syndrome called severe RSTS or 16p13.3 deletion syndrome (OMIM 610543). In the present report, we describe a case of a 2-year-old female with RSTS who, besides most of the typical features of RSTS has corpus callosum dysgenesis and a Chiari type I malformation which required neurosurgical decompression. CGH microarray showed a approximately 520.7 kb microdeletion on 16p13.3 involving CREBBP, ADCY9, and SRL genes. We hypothesize that the manifestations in this patient might be influenced by the haploinsufficiency for ADCY9 and SR.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a complex autosomal-dominant disease characterized by mental and growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities. A majority of the individuals diagnosed with RSTS carry heterozygous mutation in the gene CREBBP, but a small percentage of cases are caused by mutations in EP300. To investigate the contribution of p300 to RSTS pathoetiology, we carried out a comprehensive and multidisciplinary characterization of p300(+/-) mice. These mice exhibited facial abnormalities and impaired growth, two traits associated to RSTS in humans. We also observed abnormal gait, reduced swimming speed, enhanced anxiety in the elevated plus maze, and mild cognitive impairment during the transfer task in the water maze. These analyses demonstrate that p300(+/-) mice exhibit phenotypes that are reminiscent of neurological traits observed in RSTS patients, but their comparison with previous studies on CBP deficient strains also indicates that, in agreement with the most recent findings in human patients, the activity of p300 in cognition is likely less relevant or more susceptible to compensation than the activity of CB.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease and is characterized by mental retardation, distinctive facial features, broad and often angulated thumbs and great toes, short stature, and growth retardation. CREBBP and EP300 are the only genes currently known to be associated with RSTS. Mutations in CREBBP and EP300 were identified in approximately 50% and 3% of RSTS patients, respectively. To date, most of CREBBP mutations were de novo mutations and the recurrence rate in a family was low. Families with more than one affected child are extremely rare. In this study, we have shown a family with two affected siblings; the same mutation was found in both siblings. However, the mutation was not found in the blood or saliva DNA samples from the parents, suggesting the mechanism of germ-line mosaicism. In addition, we identified low-level mosaicism of a CREBBP mutation in the father from a second family with one affected child. Among the three analyzed tissue samples from the father, low-level mosaicism is present only significantly in the blood sample. We hypothesize mutations in CREBBP in these two families occur in the postzygotic stage in one of the parents (one generation ahead) of the affected individual. Additional family studies are required to determine how common somatic and/or gonadal mosaicism is present in RSTS patient.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a heterogeneous disorder with approximately 45-55% of patients showing mutations in the CREB binding protein and a further 3% of patients having mutations in EP300. We report a male child with a deletion of exons 3-8 of the EP300 gene who has RSTS. He has a milder skeletal phenotype, a finding that has been described in other cases with EP300 mutations. The mother suffered from pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome in the pregnancy. She subsequently developed a mullerian tumor of her cervix 6 years after the birth of her so.
 on a six-year-old boy with typical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) phenotype. Clinical findings included mental and motor retardation, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), undescended testes, hirsutism, broad thumbs with radial angulation and broad toes, and inguinal hernia. His karyotype was normal (46, XY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed no deletion of the CREBBP [cAMP response element-binding (CREB) binding protein] gene on chromosome 16p13.3. CREBBP gene sequencing also revealed normal results. We wish to present this case because this patient had typical RSTS phenotype, but normal FISH and CREBBP gene sequencing results. It could be possible that genetic heterogeneity is related with novel mutations in other genes. With the publication of such cases, their significance will be brought to the attention of researchers in this fiel.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare malformation disorder caused by mutations in the closely related CREBBP and EP300 genes, accounting respectively for up to 60 and 3% of cases. About 10% of CREBBP mutations are whole gene deletions often extending into flanking regions. Using FISH and microsatellite analyses as a first step in the CREBBP mutation screening of 42 Italian RSTS patients, we identified six deletions, three of which were in a mosaic condition that has not been previously reported in RSTS. The use of region-specific BAC clones and small CREBBP probes allowed us to assess the extent of all of the deletions by mapping their endpoints to genomic intervals of 5-10 kb. Four of our five intragenic breakpoints cluster at the 5' end of CREBBP, where there is a peak of breakpoints underlying rearrangements in RSTS patients and tumors. The search for genomic motifs did not reveal any low-copy repeats (LCRs) or any greater density of repetitive sequences. In contrast, the percentage of interspersed repetitive elements (mainly Alu and LINEs in the CREBBP exon 2 region) is significantly higher than that in the entire gene or the average in the genome, thus suggesting that this characteristic may be involved in the region's vulnerability to breaking and nonhomologous pairing. The FISH analysis extended to the EP300 genomic region did not reveal any deletions. The clinical presentation was typical in all cases, but more severe in the three patients carrying constitutional deletions, raising a question about the possible underdiagnosis of a few cases of mild RST.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a congenital disorder characterised by growth retardation, facial dysmorphisms, skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. Broad thumbs and halluces are the hallmarks of the syndrome. RSTS is associated with chromosomal rearrangements and mutations in the CREB-binding protein gene (CREBBP), also termed CBP, encoding the CREB-binding protein. Recently, it was shown that mutations in EP300, coding for the p300 protein, also cause RSTS. CBP and EP300 are highly homologous genes, which play important roles as global transcriptional coactivator.
 the phenotype of the presently known patients with RSTS (n = 4) carrying germline mutations of EP30.
nts with EP300 mutations displayed the typical facial gestalt and malformation pattern compatible with the diagnosis of RSTS. However, three patients exhibited much milder skeletal findings on the hands and feet than typically observed in patients with RST.
he clinical variability in RSTS is explained by genetic heterogeneity. The diagnosis of RSTS must be expanded to include patients without broad thumbs or halluce.
n-Taybi Syndrome (RSTS, MIM 180849) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by mental and growth retardation, broad and duplicated distal phalanges of thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphisms and increased risk of tumors. RSTS is caused by chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations in one copy of the CREB-binding protein gene (CREBBP or CBP) in 16p13.3. To date mutations in CREBBP have been reported in 56.6% of RSTS patients and an average figure of 10% has ascribed to deletion.
 is based on the mutation analysis of CREBBP in 31 Italian RSTS patients using segregation analysis of intragenic microsatellites, BAC FISH and direct sequencing of PCR and RT-PCR fragment.
fied a total of five deletions, two of the entire gene and three, all in a mosaic condition, involving either the 5' or the 3' region. By direct sequencing a total of 14 de novo mutations were identified: 10 truncating (5 frameshift and 5 nonsense), one splice site, and three novel missense mutations. Two of the latter affect the HAT domain, while one maps within the conserved nuclear receptor binding of (aa 1-170) and will probably destroy a Nuclear Localization Signal. Identification of the p.Asn1978Ser in the healthy mother of a patient also carrying a de novo frameshift mutation, questions the pathogenetic significance of the missense change reported as recurrent mutation. Thirteen additional polymorphisms, three as of yet unreported, were also detecte.
tection rate (61.3%) of mutations is confirmed by this Italian study which also attests one of the highest microdeletion rate (16%) documented so fa.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare condition with a prevalence of 1 in 125,000-720,000 births and characterized by clinical features that include facial, dental, and limb dysmorphology and growth retardation. Most cases of RSTS occur sporadically and are caused by de novo mutations. Cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities are detected in only 55% of RSTS cases. Previous genetic studies have yielded inconsistent results due to the variety of methods used for genetic analysis. The purpose of this study was to use whole exome sequencing (WES) to evaluate the genetic causes of RSTS in a young girl presenting with an Autism phenotype. We used the Autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) and Autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI-R) to confirm her diagnosis of Autism. In addition, various questionnaires were used to evaluate other psychiatric features. We used WES to analyze the DNA sequences of the patient and her parents and to search for de novo variants. The patient showed all the typical features of Autism, WES revealed a de novo frameshift mutation in CREBBP and de novo sequence variants in TNC and IGFALS genes. Mutations in the CREBBP gene have been extensively reported in RSTS patients, while potential missense mutations in TNC and IGFALS genes have not previously been associated with RSTS. The TNC and IGFALS genes are involved in central nervous system development and growth. It is possible for patients with RSTS to have additional de novo variants that could account for previously unexplained phenotype.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) can be caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions involving CREBBP or, less commonly, EP300. To date, only 15 patients with EP300 mutations have been clinically described. Frequently reported manifestations in these patients include characteristic facial and limb features, varying degrees of neurocognitive dysfunction, and maternal preeclampsia. Other congenital anomalies are less frequently reported. We describe a child found to have a de novo EP300 mutation (c.4933C&gt;T, predicted to result in p.Arg1645X) through research-based whole-genome sequencing of the family trio. The child's presentation involved dysmorphic features as well as unilateral renal agenesis, a myelomeningocele, and minor genitourinary anomalies. The involvement of congenital anomalies in all 16 clinically described patients with EP300 mutations (25% of which have been identified by &quot;hypothesis free&quot; methods, including microarray, exome, and whole-genome sequencing) is reviewed. In summary, genitourinary anomalies have been identified in 38%, cardiovascular anomalies in 25%, spinal/vertebral anomalies in 19%, other skeletal anomalies in 19%, brain anomalies in 13%, and renal anomalies in 6%. Our patient expands the phenotypic spectrum in EP300-related RSTS; this case demonstrates the evolving practice of clinical genomics related to increasing availability of genomic sequencing method.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant genetic disease, with an estimated prevalence of one case per 125,000 live births. RSTS is characterized by typical facial features, microcephaly, broad thumbs and first toes, intellectual disability, and postnatal growth retardation. However, no standard diagnostic criteria are available for RSTS. In this review, we summarized the clinical features and genetic basis of RSTS and highlighted areas for future studies on an appropriate diagnostic protocol and follow-up care for RST.
rimarily characterized by delayed growth in height and weight, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, and broad thumbs and big toe. Over 90% RSTS individuals with disabilities survive to adulthood, but healthcare for these patients is particularly complex, time-consuming, and costly. In addition, no standard diagnostic criteria and follow-up care guidelines are available for RSTS. It has been shown that mutations in the genes encoding the cyclic-AMP-regulated enhancer binding protein (CREBBP) and the E1A-binding protein p300 (EP300) contributed to the development of RSTS. Therefore, genetic tests are useful for the diagnosis of RSTS, although most RSTS cases are currently diagnosed based on clinical features. The clinical features of RSTS have been extensively studied, which significantly contributes to the diagnosis of this extremely rare syndrome. However, the pathogenesis and genotype-phenotype associations of RSTS are largely unknown. Therefore, multicenter studies and international cooperation are highlighted for better understanding of this disease, establishing standard diagnostic criteria, and providing professional management and follow-up care of RST.
n-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is characterized by distinctive facial features, broad and often angulated thumbs and great toes, short stature, and moderate to severe intellectual disability. The characteristic craniofacial features are downslanted palpebral fissures, low hanging columella, high palate, grimacing smile, and talon cusps. Prenatal growth is often normal; however, height, weight, and head circumference percentiles rapidly drop in the first few months of life. Obesity may occur in childhood or adolescence. IQ scores range from 25 to 79; average IQ is between 36 and 51. Other variable findings are coloboma, cataract, congenital heart defects, renal abnormalities, and cryptorchidis.
osis of RSTS is primarily based on clinical features. Chromosome abnormalities are occasionally observed on routine cytogenetic testing. CREBBP and EP300 are the only genes currently known to be associated with RSTS. FISH analysis of CREBBP detects microdeletions in approximately 10% of individuals with RSTS. Sequence analysis detects CREBBP pathogenic variants in another 40%-50% of affected individuals. Pathogenic variants in EP300 are identified in approximately 3%-8% of individuals with RST.
 of manifestations: Early intervention programs, special education, vocational training to address developmental disabilities, and referral to behavioral specialists/psychologists and support groups/resources for family members; standard treatment for eye abnormalities, hearing loss, cardiac defects, cryptorchidism, and sleep apnea; surgical repair of significantly angulated thumbs or duplicated halluces; aggressive management of gastroesophageal reflux and constipation. Surveillance: Monitoring of growth and feeding, especially in the first year of life; annual eye and hearing evaluations; and routine monitoring for cardiac, dental, and renal anomalie.
nherited in an autosomal dominant manner. RSTS typically occurs as the result of a de novo mutation in the family; most individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., the only affected member in a family). In most instances, the parents of an individual with RSTS are not affected. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the empiric recurrence risk for sibs is less than 1%. Individuals with RSTS rarely reproduce. The risk to offspring is 50%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant or deletion in the family is know.
l cognitive dysfunctions are frequently due to deficits in molecular pathways that underlie the induction or maintenance of synaptic plasticity. For example, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is due to a mutation in cbp, encoding the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP). CBP is a transcriptional co-activator for CREB, and induction of CREB-dependent transcription plays a key role in long-term memory (LTM). In animal models of RTS, mutations of cbp impair LTM and late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP). As a step toward exploring plausible intervention strategies to rescue the deficits in LTP, we extended our previous model of LTP induction to describe histone acetylation and simulated LTP impairment due to cbp mutation. Plausible drug effects were simulated by model parameter changes, and many increased LTP. However no parameter variation consistent with a effect of a known drug class fully restored LTP. Thus we examined paired parameter variations consistent with effects of known drugs. A pair that simulated the effects of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (slowing cAMP degradation) concurrent with a deacetylase inhibitor (prolonging histone acetylation) restored normal LTP. Importantly these paired parameter changes did not alter basal synaptic weight. A pair that simulated the effects of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an acetyltransferase activator was similarly effective. For both pairs strong additive synergism was present. The effect of the combination was greater than the summed effect of the separate parameter changes. These results suggest that promoting histone acetylation while simultaneously slowing the degradation of cAMP may constitute a promising strategy for restoring deficits in LTP that may be associated with learning deficits in RTS. More generally these results illustrate how the strategy of combining modeling and empirical studies may provide insights into the design of effective therapies for improving long-term synaptic plasticity and learning associated with cognitive disorder.
functional Creb-binding protein (CBP) protein plays a pivotal role in many critical cellular processes. Here we demonstrate that the bromodomain of CBP binds to histone H3 acetylated on lysine 56 (K56Ac) with higher affinity than to its other monoacetylated binding partners. We show that autoacetylation of CBP is critical for the bromodomain-H3 K56Ac interaction, and we propose that this interaction occurs via autoacetylation-induced conformation changes in CBP. Unexpectedly, the bromodomain promotes acetylation of H3 K56 on free histones. The CBP bromodomain also interacts with the histone chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1) via a nearby but distinct interface. This interaction is necessary for ASF1 to promote acetylation of H3 K56 by CBP, indicating that the ASF1-bromodomain interaction physically delivers the histones to the histone acetyl transferase domain of CBP. A CBP bromodomain mutation manifested in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome has compromised binding to both H3 K56Ac and ASF1, suggesting that these interactions are important for the normal function of CB.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is an incurable genetic disorder with combination of mental retardation and physical features including broad thumbs and toes, craniofacial abnormalities, and growth deficiency. While the autosomal dominant mode of transmission is limitedly known, the majority of cases are attributable to de novo mutations in RTS. The first identified gene associated with RTS is CREB-binding protein (CREBBP/CBP). Alterations of the epigenetic 'histone code' due to dysfunction of the CBP histone acetyltransferase activity deregulate gene transcriptions that are prominently linked to RTS pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss how CBP mutation contributes to modifications of histone and how histone deacetylase inhibitors are therapeutically applicable to epigenetic conditioning in RTS. Since most genetic mutations are irreversible and therapeutic approaches are limited, therapeutic targeting of reversible epigenetic components altered in RTS may be an ideal strategy. Expeditious further study on the role of the epigenetic mechanisms in RTS is encouraged to identify novel epigenetic markers and therapeutic targets to treat RT.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by facial abnormalities, broad thumbs and toes, and mental retardation. RTS is known to be caused by the disruption, either by point mutations or microdeletions, of the human CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) gene on 16p13.3. Gross rearrangements involving 16p13.3, such as translocations or inversions, have rarely been reported in RTS. A 3-month-old boy with a phenotype typical of RTS was referred for genetic diagnosis. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a novel reciprocal translocation: t(1;16)(p36.2;p13.3). Gene dosage analysis for the CREBBP gene was performed using multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and revealed heterozygous deletion of the whole CREBBP gene. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array confirmed the deletion and also indicated large genomic deletions in both 1p36.2 and 16p13.3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of characterization of the genomic dosage imbalances in RTS by SNP-arra.
astomas (MB) are classified in four subgroups: the well defined WNT and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroups, and the less defined groups 3 and 4. They occasionally occur in the context of a cancer predisposition syndrome. While germline APC mutations predispose to WNT MB, germline mutations in SUFU, PTCH1, and TP53 predispose to SHH tumors. We report on a child with a Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) due to a germline deletion in CREBBP, who developed a MB. Biological profilings demonstrate that this tumor belongs to the group 3. RTS may therefore be the first predisposition syndrome identified for non-WNT/non-SHH M.
exposure to moderate doses of valproic acid (VPA) produces brainstem abnormalities, while higher doses of this teratogen elicit social deficits in the rat. In this pilot study, we examined effects of prenatal exposure to a moderate dose of VPA on behavior and on transcriptomic expression in three brain regions that mediate social behavior. Pregnant Long Evans rats were injected with 350 mg/kg VPA or saline on gestational day 13. A modified social interaction test was used to assess social behavior and social preference/avoidance during early and late adolescence and in adulthood. VPA-exposed animals demonstrated more social investigation and play fighting than control animals. Social investigation, play fighting, and contact behavior also differed as a function of age; the frequency of these behaviors increased in late adolescence. Social preference and locomotor activity under social circumstances were unaffected by treatment or age. Thus, a moderate prenatal dose of VPA produces behavioral alterations that are substantially different from the outcomes that occur following exposure to a higher dose. At adulthood, VPA-exposed subjects exhibited transcriptomic abnormalities in three brain regions: anterior amygdala, cerebellar vermis, and orbitofrontal cortex. A common feature among the proteins encoded by the dysregulated genes was their ability to be modulated by acetylation. Analysis of the expression of individual exons also revealed that genes involved in post-translational modification and epigenetic regulation had particular isoforms that were ubiquitously dysregulated across brain regions. The vulnerability of these genes to the epigenetic effects of VPA may highlight potential mechanisms by which prenatal VPA exposure alters the development of social behavio.
has increasingly focused on the role of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding (CREB) protein in learning and memory, particularly its role in cognitive disorders and neurodegeneration, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and Coffin-Lowry syndrome. The cognitive dysfunction of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which is widely recognized, is not completely in accordance with depressive severity, and the dysfunction persists upon clinical remission in some patients. However, few studies have focused on the role of CREB on cognitive function in patients with MDD. This study aimed to investigate the influence of CREB1 polymorphism on cognitive function in patients with MDD. The current study comprised 113 patients with MDD. The severity of depression was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and cognitive function was assessed using the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test, verbal fluency test, and tests of immediate logical memory and visual reproduction. All subjects were genotyped with regard to CREB1 polymorphisms (rs10932201, rs2551645, rs2254137, rs6740584, and rs2551640). For the verbal fluency test, the results showed significant differences for all single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypic groups. For the Stroop color-word task, a significant difference was found only for rs6740584. No significant differences were found for the Stroop color task, the immediate logical memory test or the visual reproduction test. In conclusion, there was an effect of CREB1 polymorphism on selective attention and retrieval of long-term memory, but not on immediate memor.
berrations in the CREBBP (CREB-binding protein - CREBBP or CBP) gene such as point mutations, small insertions or exonic copy number changes are usually associated with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTs). In this study, the disruption of the CREBBP gene on chromosome 16p13.3, as revealed by CGH-array and FISH, suggests immune dysregulation in a patient with the Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RTs) phenotype. Further investigation with Western blot techniques demonstrated decreased expression of CREB, NFκB, c-Jun, c-Fos, BCL2 and cMyc in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, thus indicating that the CREBBP gene is essential for the normal expression of these proteins and the regulation of immune response.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (prevalence 1:125,000) characterised by broad thumbs and halluces, facial dysmorphism, psychomotor development delay, skeletal defects, abnormalities in the posterior fossa and short stature. The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions of the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) (50-60% of the cases) and of the homologous gene E1A-binding protein (EP300) (5%.
be, for the first time in literature, a RTS Caucasian girl, 14-year-old, with growth hormone (GH) deficiency, pituitary hypoplasia, Arnold Chiari malformation type 1, double syringomyelic cavity and a novel CREBBP mutation (c.3546insCC.
esize that CREBBP mutation we have identified in this patient could be responsible also for RTS atypical features as GH deficiency and pituitary hypoplasi.
n-Taybi syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, psychomotor developmental delay, skeletal anomalies, peculiar facial morphology, and tumorigenesis. Mutations in the gene encoding the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB, also known as CREBBP or CBP) on chromosome 16p13.3 have been identified. In addition, some patients with low intelligence quotients and autistic features bear large deletions. Based on these observations, we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to search for large deletions affecting the CREBBP gene in a Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome patient. We identified a novel heterozygote deletion removing five exons (exons 17-21), encoding the histone acetyltransferase domain. We propose the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification as a fast, accurate and cheap test for detecting large deletions in the CREBBP gene in the sub-group of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome patients with low intelligence quotients and autistic feature.
Harbor syndrome (FHS) is a rare genetic disorder recently shown to be caused by mutations in the Snf2-related CREB-binding protein activator protein gene (SRCAP). It comprises three key clinical features of characteristic facies, expressive and receptive speech impairment and short stature. We report on a patient with this syndrome associated with early adult-onset hypertension and bilateral polycystic kidneys. Family screening for polycystic kidney disease was negative and mutations in polycystic kidney disease 1 and 2 genes (PKD1 and PKD2) were absent. Sequencing of the SRCAP gene demonstrated a de novo mutation matching one of the known FHS-associated mutations. The patient required treatment with anti-hypertensives and will require lifelong renal monitoring. We suggest this patient's presentation may be due to the pleiotropic effects of SRCAP mutations. Further, the protein encoded by SRCAP is known to interact with CREB-binding protein, the product of the gene mutated in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is associated with renal abnormalities. A literature review of the renal findings in patients with Floating-Harbor syndrome identified another patient with possible polycystic kidneys, two patients with early onset hypertension, and a young patient with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, which can be a feature of classic adult polycystic kidney disease. Collectively, these findings suggest that all patients with Floating-Harbor syndrome should undergo regular blood pressure monitoring and screening for polycystic kidneys by ultrasound at the time of the FHS diagnosis with imaging to be repeated during adulthood if a childhood ultrasound was negativ.
duction of molecular karyotyping technologies into the diagnostic work-up of patients with congenital disorders permitted the identification and delineation of novel microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Interstitial 16p13.3 duplication, encompassing the CREBBP gene, which is mutated or deleted in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, have been proposed to cause a recognisable syndrome with variable intellectual disability, normal growth, mild facial dysmorphism, mild anomalies of the extremities, and occasional findings such as developmental defects of the heart, genitalia, palate or the eyes. We here report the phenotypic and genotypic delineation of 9 patients carrying a submicroscopic 16p13.3 duplication, including the smallest 16p13.3 duplication reported so far. Careful clinical assessment confirms the distinctive clinical phenotype and also defines frequent associated features : marked speech problems, frequent ocular region involvement with upslanting of the eyes, narrow palpebral fissures, ptosis and strabismus, frequent proximal implantation of thumbs, cleft palate/bifid uvula and inguinal hernia. It also confirms that CREBBP is the critical gene involved in the duplication 16p13.3 syndrom.
 on a patient with a recognizable phenotype of intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, musculoskeletal anomalies and craniofacial dysmorphisms, carrying a de novo 0.4 Mb duplication of chromosome region 16p13.3 detected by SNP-array analysis. In addition, myopia, microcephaly and growth retardation were observed. The causal 16p13.3 duplication is one of the smallest reported so far, and includes the CREB binding protein gene (CREBBP, MIM 600140), whose haploinsufficiency is responsible for the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and the adenylate cyclase 9 gene (ADCY9, MIM 603302). By comparing the clinical manifestations of our patient with those of patients carrying similar rearrangements, we confirmed that 16p13.3 microduplications of the Rubinstein-Taybi region result in a recognizable clinical condition that likely represents a single gene disorder. In addition, our case allowed us to define with more precision the smallest region of overlap (SRO) in all patients reported so far, encompassing only the CREBBP gene, and is useful to confirm and further define the phenotypic characteristics due to duplication of the CREBBP gene, being the first case of interstitial duplication with microcephaly and growth defects reported to dat.
se of this report is to describe the fluorescein angiography findings in a case of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography were performed on a 6-year-old male with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome due to CREB binding protein gene mutation. Fundus photography showed glaucomatous cupping and diffusely attenuated retinal vasculature. Choroidal vasculature was prominent due to diffuse retinal atrophy with scattered focal retinal pigment epithelial changes. Fluorescein angiography showed retinal vascular attenuation, prolonged arteriovenous transit time with delayed venous filling, late small vessel leakage, and 360 degrees of peripheral avascularity. Peripheral retinal avascularity and retinal vascular inflammation evidenced by late small vessel leakage can be demonstrated by fluorescein angiography in the retinal dystrophy of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrom.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by broad thumbs and halluces, dysmorphic facial features, mental retardation, and short stature. Mutations in the cAMP-response element binding protein-BP (CREBBP) gene (50-60% of cases) and E1A-binding protein (EP300, 3%) are known genetic causes in affected individuals. Here, we describe a genetically confirmed Korean RTS patient with atypical features, including Hirschsprung disease and growth hormone deficiency. Mutational analysis revealed a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation, c.2064_2077del14 (p.Gly689Cysfs*32) in the CREBBP gen.
sing the placental transcriptome to identify key molecules relevant for preeclampsia are hampered by a relatively small sample size. In addition, they use a variety of bioinformatics and statistical methods, making comparison of findings challenging. To generate a more robust preeclampsia gene expression signature, we performed a meta-analysis on the original data of 11 placenta RNA microarray experiments, representing 139 normotensive and 116 preeclamptic pregnancies. Microarray data were pre-processed and analyzed using standardized bioinformatics and statistical procedures and the effect sizes were combined using an inverse-variance random-effects model. Interactions between genes in the resulting gene expression signature were identified by pathway analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Graphite) and protein-protein associations (STRING). This approach has resulted in a comprehensive list of differentially expressed genes that led to a 388-gene meta-signature of preeclamptic placenta. Pathway analysis highlights the involvement of the previously identified hypoxia/HIF1A pathway in the establishment of the preeclamptic gene expression profile, while analysis of protein interaction networks indicates CREBBP/EP300 as a novel element central to the preeclamptic placental transcriptome. In addition, there is an apparent high incidence of preeclampsia in women carrying a child with a mutation in CREBBP/EP300 (Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome). The 388-gene preeclampsia meta-signature offers a vital starting point for further studies into the relevance of these genes (in particular CREBBP/EP300) and their concomitant pathways as biomarkers or functional molecules in preeclampsia. This will result in a better understanding of the molecular basis of this disease and opens up the opportunity to develop rational therapies targeting the placental dysfunction causal to preeclampsi.
n-Taybi syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial and limb features and is associated with several types of tumors. A 29-yr-old woman with this syndrome presented with a large, complex ovarian mass. She was subsequently diagnosed with a low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary and an endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is an autosomal dominant, multiple congenital anomalies-mental retardation syndrome. Two genes, CREBBP and EP300, have been found to be associated with this disorder, although some cases do not have an identifiable cause. These genes code for proteins that acetylate histone tails, an epigenetic modification that serves to control transcription. They also serve as cofactors to several transcription factors and modulate p53. Although these patients have a predisposition to benign and malignant neoplasms, no malignant gynecologic neoplasm has been described thus far. Although no significant evidence linking CREBBP and EP300 to gynecologic malignancies has yet been found, some studies have suggested that hypoacetylation of histones may be involved in endometrial and ovarian carcinoma.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare multiple congenital anomalies-intellectual disability syndrome. The diagnosis is made after birth and based on the detection of signs such as growth and developmental delay, minor facial anomalies, and broad thumbs and halluces. It is rare to suspect RTS during the prenatal period. We report here the approach to a patient with RTS whose pregnancy was complicated by multiple congenital anomalies. However, in the presence of the broad thumb and facial anomalies, we were able to suggest the correct diagnosis. The RTS was confirmed at birth and the molecular analysis of the major causative gene revealed a previously unreported heterozygous truncating mutation of CREBBP. This report provides new knowledge of the fetal phenotype of RT.
enetic disorders are characterized by normal head size at birth, followed by deceleration in head growth resulting in postnatal microcephaly. Among these are classic disorders such as Angelman syndrome and MECP2-related disorder (formerly Rett syndrome), as well as more recently described clinical entities associated with mutations in CASK, CDKL5, CREBBP, and EP300 (Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome), FOXG1, SLC9A6 (Christianson syndrome), and TCF4 (Pitt-Hopkins syndrome). These disorders can be identified clinically by phenotyping across multiple neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral realms, and enough data are available to recognize these postnatal microcephaly disorders as separate diagnostic entities in their own right. A second diagnostic grouping, comprised of Warburg MICRO syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, and Cerebral-oculo-facial skeletal syndrome, share similar features of somatic growth failure, ophthalmologic, and dysmorphologic features. Many postnatal microcephaly syndromes are caused by mutations in genes important in the regulation of gene expression in the developing forebrain and hindbrain, although important synaptic structural genes also play a role. This is an emerging group of disorders with a fascinating combination of brain malformations, specific epilepsies, movement disorders, and other complex neurobehavioral abnormalitie.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) and Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) are genetically heterogeneous multiple anomalies syndromes, each having a distinctive facial gestalt. Two genes (CREBBP and EP300) are known to cause RTS, and five (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8) have been associated with CdLS. A diagnosis of RTS or CdLS is molecularly confirmed in only 65% of clinically identified cases, suggesting that additional causative genes exist for both conditions. In addition, although EP300 and CREBBP encode homologous proteins and perform similar functions, only eight EP300 positive RTS patients have been reported, suggesting that patients with EP300 mutations might be escaping clinical recognition. We report on a child with multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disability whose facial features and complex phenotype resemble CdLS. However, no mutations in CdLS-related genes were identified. Rather, a novel EP300 mutation was found on whole exome sequencing. Possible links between EP300 and genes causing CdLS are evident in the literature. Both EP300 and HDAC8 are involved in the regulation of TP53 transcriptional activity. In addition, p300 and other chromatin associated proteins, including NIPBL, SMCA1, and SMC3, have been found at enhancer regions in different cell types. It is therefore possible that EP300 and CdLS-related genes are involved in additional shared pathways, producing overlapping phenotypes. As whole exome sequencing becomes more widely utilized, the diverse phenotypes associated with EP300 mutations should be better understood. In the meantime, testing for EP300 mutations in those with features of CdLS may be warrante.
phenotype analysis of at least 25 individuals with interstitial 16p13.3 duplications defines a recognizable syndrome associated with duplication of a critical Rubinstein-Taybi region encompassing only the CREBBP gene. Nevertheless, variable or incompletely penetrant phenotype has been reported previously. We here report a case of a 5-year old boy with a recognizable phenotype of this syndrome, including intellectual disability, mild arthrogryposis, small and proximally implanted thumbs and characteristic facial features. In addition, growth delay, microcephaly and distinguishable structural brain MRI abnormalities were observed. A de novo 1.5 Mb interstitial duplication of 16p13.3 was detected by SNP-array and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) analysis with marker D16S475 indicated that the duplication was formed before maternal meiosis II. Our findings highlight the variable clinical features and further expand the phenotypic spectrum correlated with this lately proposed syndrom.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder and is characterized by mental retardation, distinctive facial features, broad and often angulated thumbs and great toes. We report on a 7 year old boy with classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. His facial and clinical features were very typical, including broad thumbs with radial angulation and broad great toes. Rigorous genetic analysis of the CREBBP and EP300 genes using DNA sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) revealed no causative mutation in this boy, only a hitherto unreported but paternally inherited heterozygous sequence alteration, c.506 1+9C&gt;T in IVS 30-31, which most likely represents a normal variant (NetGene 2 splice prediction software). We question if this boy could have a hitherto undetectable mutation typ.
Harbor syndrome (FHS) is a rare condition characterized by short stature, delayed osseous maturation, expressive-language deficits, and a distinctive facial appearance. Occurrence is generally sporadic, although parent-to-child transmission has been reported on occasion. Employing whole-exome sequencing, we identified heterozygous truncating mutations in SRCAP in five unrelated individuals with sporadic FHS. Sanger sequencing identified mutations in SRCAP in eight more affected persons. Mutations were de novo in all six instances in which parental DNA was available. SRCAP is an SNF2-related chromatin-remodeling factor that serves as a coactivator for CREB-binding protein (CREBBP, better known as CBP, the major cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome [RTS]). Five SRCAP mutations, two of which are recurrent, were identified; all are tightly clustered within a small (111 codon) region of the final exon. These mutations are predicted to abolish three C-terminal AT-hook DNA-binding motifs while leaving the CBP-binding and ATPase domains intact. Our findings show that SRCAP mutations are the major cause of FHS and offer an explanation for the clinical overlap between FHS and RT.
 in the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) are a major cause of the human skeletal dysplasia Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS); however, the mechanism by which these mutations affect skeletal mineralization and patterning is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) as a key regulator of CBP activity and demonstrate that its functions map to both osteoprogenitor cells and mature osteoblasts. In osteoblasts, PDK1 activated the CREB/CBP complex, which in turn controlled runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) activation and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). These pathways also operated in vivo, as evidenced by recapitulation of RTS spectrum phenotypes with osteoblast-specific Pdk1 deletion in mice (Pdk1osx mice) and by the genetic interactions observed in mice heterozygous for both osteoblast-specific Pdk1 deletion and either Runx2 or Creb deletion. Finally, treatment of Pdk1osx and Cbp+/- embryos with BMPs in utero partially reversed their skeletal anomalies at birth. These findings illustrate the in vivo function of the PDK1-AKT-CREB/CBP pathway in bone formation and provide proof of principle for in utero growth factor supplementation as a potential therapy for skeletal dysplasia.
lformations are multifactorial and heterogeneous entities, characterized by abnormalities in the posterior fossa. They have been identified in association with various genetic syndromes in recent years. Two previous studies have noted an association of Chiari malformations with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS). In this clinical report, we highlight identical twins with RTS caused by a mutation in CREBBP that presented with slightly different Chiari malformations in association with an extensive multiloculated syrinx and scoliosis. RTS has been found to be associated with craniocervical abnormalities in literature review, and this clinical report demonstrates the prudent consideration of the physician who cares for patients impacted by RTS to effectively screen via symptomatology and physical examination for Chiari pathology or other craniocervical abnormalitie.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a congenital disorder characterized by typical facial features, broad thumbs and toes, with mental retardation. Additionally, tumors, keloids and various congenital anomalies including congenital heart defects have been reported in RTS patients. In about 50% of the patients, mutations in the CREB binding protein (CREBBP) have been found, which are understood to be associated with cell growth and proliferation. Here, we describe a typical RTS patient with Arnold-Chiari malformation. A mutation in the CREBBP gene, c.4944_4945insC, was identified by mutational analysi.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare developmental disorder characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms, broad thumbs and toes, mental and growth deficiency, and recurrent respiratory infections. RTS has been associated with CREBBP gene mutations, but EP300 gene mutations have recently been reported in 6 individuals. In the present study, the humoral immune response in 16 RTS patients with recurrent respiratory infections of possible bacterial etiology was evaluated. No significant differences between patients and 16 healthy controls were detected to explain the high susceptibility to respiratory infections: normal or elevated serum immunoglobulin levels, normal salivary IgA levels, and a good antibody response to both polysaccharide and protein antigens were observed. However, most patients presented high serum IgM levels, a high number of total B cell and B subsets, and also high percentiles of apoptosis, suggesting that they could present B dysregulation. The CREBBP/p300 family gene is extremely important for B-cell regulation, and RTS may represent an interesting human model for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in B-cell developmen.
stein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is defined congenital anomalies and is characterized by postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, specific facial characteristics, broad thumbs and big toes, and mental retardation. RTS displays an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and is typically caused by cAMP response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein deficiency. Various complications such as eye anomalies and a variety of congenital heart defects are reported in such cases. We treated an RTS patient who had a dissecting aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery. The patient was a 44-year-old man who was brought to our hospital because of sudden left hemiplegia. Magnetic resonance images showed a cerebral infarction caused by anterior cerebral artery dissection. Coil embolization was performed on enlargement of the dissecting aneurysm, and the procedure was successfu.
e accompanied by cerebrovascular diseas.
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is very rare. Here we report on the 6th and 7th case of inherited RTS. Family 1 presents with incomplete or mild RTS over three generations; a 13-year-old girl (proband 1) with mild but typical facial features and learning disabilities, her very mildly affected mother (proband 2), and the maternal grandmother (proband 3). Family 2 includes three females with classical RTS (probands 4-6) and their father (proband 7) with broad thumbs and halluces. Proband 5 also had a brain tumor (ganglioglioma) at the age of 3 years. In probands 1-3, direct sequencing identified a novel CREBBP missense mutation, c.2728A &gt; G (predicting p.Thr910Ala), that was absent in non-affected family members. The p.Thr910Ala variant is outside the crucial histone acetyltransferase domain, and this may explain the mild and variable phenotype. In probands 4-7 we identified another novel CREBBP mutation, c.4134G &gt; T, which alters the consensus splice sequence at position 1 of exon 25. The c.4134G &gt; T mutation was transmitted from the very mildly affected father who displayed somatic mosaicism (with 38% mutated alleles in blood and 31% in buccal smear DNA) to his three daughters. Our findings emphasize that variable expression (family 1) and somatic mosaicism (family 2) contribute to the phenotypic variability of RTS. Somatic mosaicism may be more frequent in RTS than previously assumed. Accumulating data suggest a recurrence risk of approximately 0.5-1% for parents of a child with RTS, exceeding the so far estimated risk of approximately 0.1% for sibling.
g evidence indicates that epigenetic changes regulate cell genesis. Here, we ask about neural precursors, focusing on CREB binding protein (CBP), a histone acetyltransferase that, when haploinsufficient, causes Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS), a genetic disorder with cognitive dysfunction. We show that neonatal cbp(+/-) mice are behaviorally impaired, displaying perturbed vocalization behavior. cbp haploinsufficiency or genetic knockdown with siRNAs inhibited differentiation of embryonic cortical precursors into all three neural lineages, coincident with decreased CBP binding and histone acetylation at promoters of neuronal and glial genes. Inhibition of histone deacetylation rescued these deficits. Moreover, CBP phosphorylation by atypical protein kinase C zeta was necessary for histone acetylation at neural gene promoters and appropriate differentiation. These data support a model in which environmental cues regulate CBP activity and histone acetylation to control neural precursor competency to differentiate, and indicate that cbp haploinsufficiency disrupts this mechanism, thereby likely causing cognitive dysfunction in RT.
osis of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is primarily clinical and based on the characteristic phenotype that is often combined with a variety of somatic anomalies and psychiatric disorder.
aper, a review is presented of the psychiatric and behavioural aspects of RTS. This is illustrated with a case repor.
al aspects of about 150 patients are described, and include a variable degree of mental retardation, impulsivity, distractibility, instability of mood and stereotypies. In general, patients with RTS are described as sociable and friendly. Information about brain pathology is virtually absent. In about half of the cases, the syndrome is caused by a mutation or deletion of the CREB-binding protein (CBP) gene (16p13.3). The case report deals with an adult male who was referred for impulsivity and temper outbursts. A provisional diagnosis of atypical depression was made, and treatment with citalopram resulted in a remarkable amelioration of his mood and behaviour that persisted for more than 2 years (last observation.
with undetected genetic syndromes do occur in clinical psychiatry, and the clinician has to consider such disorders in cases with disturbed development, dysmorphias and somatic comorbidit.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare syndrome with a frequency of approximately 1 in 125,000 affected newborns, which is characterized by mental retardation, growth retardation, a particular dysmorphology and, in a subset of cases, immunodeficiency. RTS is typically caused by CREBBP deficiency, and heterozygous mutation or deletion of the CREBBP gene has been identified in 60-70% of patients. The inheritance is autosomal dominant but reports of vertical transmission are exceedingly rare; near-all cases are caused by de novo mutations. Here we present an 8-month-old boy with varicella meningoencephalitis, RTS, and a de novo deletion of the CREBBP gene of two base pairs at position 201-202 in exon 2, c. 201 202delT. The mutation has not been described previously but it predicts a protein truncation, and truncating CREBBP mutations are typical causes of RT.
regarding the behavioral aspects of children with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) has suggested some possible behavioral patterns including autistic features. Caregivers of 39 children (mean age = 8.4 years) with RTS (49% showing abnormality in CREBBP gene) and 39 children (mean age = 8.6 years) matched on developmental level, age and gender were administered the Child Behavior Checklist and the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire. Children with RTS did not exhibit higher internalizing (affective and anxiety symptoms) or externalizing (disruptive symptoms) behavioral problems than expected for their age/developmental range. However, they displayed some specific behaviors: short attention span, motor stereotypies, poor coordination, and overweight. The presence of an identified CREBBP gene abnormality was possibly related to the motor difficulties through impaired motor skills learnin.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual impairment syndrome. Loss of function in CREBBP or EP300 genes has been found in about 50% of patients with RTS. Genotype-phenotype correlations were investigated in 93 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for RTS during 2 international RTS family conferences. Mutation analysis of CREBBP was performed on all 31 coding exons and exon-intron junctions; a subset of patients had FISH analysis for large deletions. A total of 64 different variations were observed in the DNA sequence, and determined to be definitive mutations in 52 patients (56%). Mutations detected included: 10 missense mutations; 36 truncating or splice-site mutations; and 6 large deletions detectable by FISH. Fourteen patients had synonymous changes of unknown significance. The majority of mutations affected the HAT domain of CREBBP or predicted termination of the protein before the HAT region. Extensive phenotypic data were collected on each patient and analyzed to determine correlations with mutation types, that is, truncating, large deletions, single amino acid substitutions, or no CREBBP mutation. All four groups displayed the characteristic facial and thumb dysmorphology. Growth retardation in height and weight was seen more frequently in patients with no CREBBP mutation; seizure disorder was more frequent in those with CREBBP mutations. Degree of mental retardation was similar in all groups, although there was a trend toward lower IQ and autistic features in patients with large deletions. Similarity in phenotype between the groups implies that the several genes involved in causing RTS likely have effects through the same pathwa.
n-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is characterized by mental retardation, broad thumbs and great toes and a recognizable craniofacial phenotype. Causative mutations have been described in the CREBBP and EP300 genes. Here we present a 19-year-old woman and an unrelated 3-year-old boy, both with broad thumbs and halluces, but with facial aspects distinct from those of typical RTS. The woman had a marked learning disability, but no mental retardation. We identified a de novo c.7100delC mutation in EP300 (which predicts p.P2366RfsX35) in the woman and an apparently de novo c.638delG mutation in the boy, which predicts p.G213EfsX6. Mutations in EP300 are a known but rare cause of RTS. Only five other patients have been reported. We propose that individuals with EP300 mutations may exhibit a slightly different phenotype compared to individuals with CREBBP mutations, with milder cognitive impairment, more pronounced microcephaly, absent or mild downslanting of palpebral fissures, distinct arched eyebrows, and greater degree of retrognathi.
stein-Taybi syndrome (RTS; OMIM 180849) is a well-defined mental retardation/multiple congenital anomalies (MR/MCA) syndrome characterized by postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, specific facial features, broad thumbs and halluces, and MR of variable degree. Ten percent of patients with RTS have a microdeletion 16p13.3, 40-50% carry a mutation of the CREBBP gene and another 3% have a mutation in the EP300 gene. In the remaining patients with clinically suspected RTS no mutation can be detected. Here we describe two patients with an RTS phenotype, one with a mutation in the CREBBP gene and the other without a detectable CREBBP or EP300 mutation and without a chromosomal imbalance on high-resolution arrays. Both patients present with the characteristic facial RTS phenotype, broad thumbs and big toes, mild MR, formation of keloids and glaucoma, but without postnatal growth retardation or microcephaly. In addition, they have both congenital camptodactyly of third (and fourth) fingers, which has not reported in RTS previously. We suggest that they represent a clinical subtype of RT.
lucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) is responsible for glucose uptake in intestinal epithelial cells. It has been shown that the intestinal SGLT1 level is significantly increased in diabetic individuals and positively correlated with the pathogenesis of diabetes. The development of targeted therapeutics that can reduce the intestinal SGLT1 expression level is therefore important. In this study, we showed that ginsenoside Rg1 effectively decreased intestinal glucose uptake through inhibition of SGLT1 gene expression in vivo and in vitro. Transient transfection analysis of the SGLT1 promoter revealed an essential cAMP response element (CRE) which confers the Rg1-mediated inhibition of SGLT1 gene expression. ChIP assay and targeted CREB silencing demonstrated that Rg1 reduced the promoter binding of CRE-binding protein (CREB) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) that is associated with an inactivated chromatin status. In addition, further studies showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway also plays an essential role in the inhibitory effect of Rg1. Taken together, our study demonstrates the involvement of EGFR-CREB signaling pathway in the Rg1-mediated downregulation of SGLT1 expression, which offers a potential strategy in the development of anti-hyperglycemic and anti-diabetic treatment.
and coordinated regulation of innate immune receptor-driven signaling networks often determines the net outcome of the immune responses. Here, we investigated the cross-regulation of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)2 pathways mediated by Ac2PIM, a tetra-acylated form of mycobacterial cell wall component and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a peptidoglycan derivative respectively. While Ac2PIM treatment of macrophages compromised their ability to induce NOD2-dependent immunomodulators like cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, no change in the NOD2-responsive NO, TNF-α, VEGF-A and IL-12 levels was observed. Further, genome-wide microRNA expression profiling identified Ac2PIM-responsive miR-150 and miR-143 to target NOD2 signaling adaptors, RIP2 and TAK1 respectively. Interestingly, Ac2PIM was found to activate the SRC-FAK-PYK2-CREB cascade via TLR2 to recruit CBP/P300 at the promoters of miR-150 and miR-143 and epigenetically induce their expression. Loss-of-function studies utilizing specific miRNA inhibitors establish that Ac2PIM, via the miRNAs, abrogate NOD2-induced PI3K-PKCδ-MAPK pathway to suppress β-CATENIN-mediated expression of COX-2, SOCS-3 and MMP-9. Our investigation has thus underscored the negative regulatory role of Ac2PIM-TLR2 signaling on NOD2 pathway which could broaden our understanding on vaccine potential or adjuvant utilities of Ac2PIM and/or MD.
essive neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as loss of cognitive functions, and finally leads to death of the affected individual. AD may result from accumulation of amyloid plaques. These amyloid plaques comprising of amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) polypeptides results from the improper cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain. The Aβ42 plaques have been shown to disrupt the normal cellular processes and thereby trigger abnormal signaling which results in the death of neurons. However, the molecular-genetic mechanism(s) responsible for Aβ42 mediated neurodegeneration is yet to be fully understoo.
tilized Gal4/UAS system to develop a transgenic fruit fly model for Aβ42 mediated neurodegeneration. Targeted misexpression of human Aβ42 in the differentiating photoreceptor neurons of the developing eye of transgenic fly triggers neurodegeneration. This progressive neurodegenerative phenotype resembles Alzheimer's like neuropathology. We identified a histone acetylase, CREB Binding Protein (CBP), as a genetic modifier of Aβ42 mediated neurodegeneration. Targeted misexpression of CBP along with Aβ42 in the differentiating retina can significantly rescue neurodegeneration. We found that gain-of-function of CBP rescues Aβ42 mediated neurodegeneration by blocking cell death. Misexpression of Aβ42 affects the targeting of axons from retina to the brain but misexpression of full length CBP along with Aβ42 can restore this defect. The CBP protein has multiple domains and is known to interact with many different proteins. Our structure function analysis using truncated constructs lacking one or more domains of CBP protein, in transgenic flies revealed that Bromo, HAT and polyglutamine (BHQ) domains together are required for the neuroprotective function of CBP. This BHQ domain of CBP has not been attributed to promote survival in any other neurodegenerative disorder.
dentified CBP as a genetic modifier of Aβ42 mediated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we have identified BHQ domain of CBP is responsible for its neuroprotective function. These studies may have significant bearing on our understanding of genetic basis of A.
les are seasonally breeding lizards in which male sexual behavior is primarily regulated by an annual increase in testosterone. This hormone activates stereotyped behaviors, as well as morphological and biochemical changes in the brain, with greater effect in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season. This study is the first description of CREB binding protein (CBP) in the reptilian brain, and investigates the possibility that changes in CBP, an androgen receptor coactivator, may facilitate differences in responsiveness to testosterone across seasons. A portion of this gene was cloned for the green anole, and in situ hybridization was performed to examine the expression of CBP in the brains of gonadally intact male and female green anoles across breeding states. Additionally, hormonal regulation of CBP was evaluated across sex and season in animals that were gonadectomized and treated with testosterone or a control. Similar to other vertebrates, CBP was expressed at relatively high levels in steroid-sensitive brain regions. In the anole ventromedial amygdala, CBP mRNA levels were nearly twice as high in gonadally intact females compared to males. In contrast, CBP expression did not differ across seasons or hormone manipulation in this brain region. No significant effects were detected in the preoptic area or ventromedial hypothalamus. This pattern suggests that CBP might influence female-biased functions controlled by the ventromedial amygdala, but is not consistent with a role in mediating seasonal differences in responsiveness to testosterone in these areas associated with reproductive functio.
c AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a signal-dependent transcription factor that exerts its positive effects on gene transcription of a broad range of genes by recruiting coactivators, including CREB-binding protein (CBP), its paralog, p300, and the family of CRTC (CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators) proteins. Whereas recruitment of CBP/p300 is dependent on CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, recruitment of CRTCs is not. Here we describe how both mechanisms could concurrently drive transcription of CREB targets in a subset of head and neck cancers featuring chromosomal translocations that fuse portions of CRTC1 and CRTC3 genes with that of the Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator MAML2. We show that a peptide derived from transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) of MAML2 binds to the CBP KIX domain with micromolar affinity. An ∼20-residue segment within this peptide, conserved in MAML2 orthologs and paralogs, binds directly to a KIX surface previously shown to bind to MLL1. The 20-residue MAML2 segment shares sequence similarity with MLL1, especially at those positions in direct contact with KIX, and like MLL1, the segment is characterized by the presence of an ∼10-residue helix. Because CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion proteins are constitutively nuclear, like CREB, our results suggest constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300 to CREB targets that could be further enhanced by signals that cause CREB Ser133 phosphorylatio.
onses are critical to a variety of human autoimmune diseases, and therapeutic targeting with monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 and IL-23 has shown considerable promise. Here, we report data to support selective bromodomain blockade of the transcriptional coactivators CBP (CREB binding protein) and p300 as an alternative approach to inhibit human Th17 responses. We show that CBP30 has marked molecular specificity for the bromodomains of CBP and p300, compared with 43 other bromodomains. In unbiased cellular testing on a diverse panel of cultured primary human cells, CBP30 reduced immune cell production of IL-17A and other proinflammatory cytokines. CBP30 also inhibited IL-17A secretion by Th17 cells from healthy donors and patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Transcriptional profiling of human T cells after CBP30 treatment showed a much more restricted effect on gene expression than that observed with the pan-BET (bromo and extraterminal domain protein family) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. This selective targeting of the CBP/p300 bromodomain by CBP30 will potentially lead to fewer side effects than with the broadly acting epigenetic inhibitors currently in clinical trial.
ystem development relies on the generation of precise numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The homeodomain transcription factor, T-cell leukemia 3 (Tlx3), functions as the master neuronal fate regulator by instructively promoting the specification of glutamatergic excitatory neurons and suppressing the specification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) neurons. However, how Tlx3 promotes glutamatergic neuronal subtype specification is poorly understood. In this study, we found that Tlx3 directly interacts with the epigenetic co-activator cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and that the Tlx3 homeodomain is essential for this interaction. The interaction between Tlx3 and CBP was enhanced by the three amino acid loop extension (TALE)-class homeodomain transcription factor, pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 3 (Pbx3). Using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells stably expressing Tlx3, we found that the interaction between Tlx3 and CBP became detectable only after these Tlx3-expressing ES cells were committed to a neural lineage, which coincided with increased Pbx3 expression during neural differentiation from ES cells. Forced expression of mutated Tlx3 lacking the homeodomain in ES cells undergoing neural differentiation resulted in significantly reduced expression of glutamatergic neuronal subtype markers, but had little effect on the expression on pan neural markers. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that functional interplay between Tlx3 and CBP plays a critical role in neuronal subtype specification, providing novel insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanism that modulates the transcriptional efficacy of a selective set of neuronal subtype-specific genes during differentiatio.
actor-κB (NF-κB) is an inducible transcription factor that mediates immune and inflammatory responses. NF-κB pathways are also involved in cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, autophagy, senescence, and protection against apoptosis. The deregulation of NF-κB activity is found in a number of disease states, including cancer, arthritis, chronic inflammation, asthma, neurodegenerative diseases, and heart disease. The 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) family, which is serine/threonine kinases, is phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and is related to NF-κB pathways. Our previous studies revealed that Sec6, a component of the exocyst complex, plays specific roles in cell-cell adhesion and cell cycle arrest. However, the mechanism by which Sec6 regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway is unknown. We demonstrated that Sec6 knockdown inhibited the degradation of IκBα and delayed the nucleus-cytoplasm translocation of p65 in HeLa cells transfected with Sec6 siRNAs after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Furthermore, the binding of p65 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) or p300 decreased and NF-κB related genes which were inhibitors of NF-κB alpha (IκBα), A20, B cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were low in cells transfected with Sec6 siRNAs in response to TNF-α stimulation. Sec6 knockdown decreased the expression of p90RSKs and the phosphorylation of ERK or p90RSK1 at Ser380 or IκBα at Ser32. The present study suggests that Sec6 regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity via the control of the phosphorylation of IκBα, p90RSK1, and ERK. This article is protected by copyright.

ing protein (CBP) and p300 are transcriptional coactivators involved in numerous biological processes that affect cell growth, transformation, differentiation, and development. In this study, we provide evidence of the involvement of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) in the regulation of CBP activity. We show that HIPK2 interacts with and phosphorylates several regions of CBP. We demonstrate that serines 2361, 2363, 2371, 2376, and 2381 are responsible for the HIPK2-induced mobility shift of CBP C-terminal activation domain. Moreover, we show that HIPK2 strongly potentiates the transcriptional activity of CBP. However, our data suggest that HIPK2 activates CBP mainly by counteracting the repressive action of cell cycle regulatory domain 1 (CRD1), located between amino acids 977 and 1076, independently of CBP phosphorylation. Our findings thus highlight a complex regulation of CBP activity by HIPK2, which might be relevant for the control of specific sets of target genes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosi.
r reviews the distinctive roles played by the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cell physiology in colorectal cancer (CRC). Specifically, we focus on the effects of CBP- and p300-mediated Wnt activity on (1) neoplastic progression; (2) the activities of butyrate, a breakdown product of dietary fiber, on cell signaling and colonic cell physiology; (3) the development of resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), including butyrate and synthetic HDACis, in colonic cells; and (4) the physiology and number of cancer stem cells. Mutations of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway initiate the majority of CRC cases, and we have shown that hyperactivation of this pathway by butyrate and other HDACis promotes CRC cell apoptosis. This activity by butyrate may in part explain the preventive action of fiber against CRC. However, individuals with a high-fiber diet may still develop neoplasia; therefore, resistance to the chemopreventive action of butyrate likely contributes to CRC. CBP or p300 may modify the ability of butyrate to influence colonic cell physiology since the two transcriptional coactivators affect Wnt signaling, and likely, its hyperactivation by butyrate. Also, CBP and p300 likely affect colonic tumorigenesis, as well as stem cell pluripotency. Improvement of CRC prevention and therapy requires a better understanding of the alterations in Wnt signaling and gene expression that underlie neoplastic progression, stem cell fate, and the development of resistance to butyrate and clinically relevant HDACis. Detailed knowledge of how CBP- and p300 modulate colonic cell physiology may lead to new approaches for anti-CRC prevention and therapeutics, particularly with respect to combinatorial therapy of CBP/p300 inhibitors with HDACi.
ally disordered proteins (IDPs) frequently function in protein interaction networks that regulate crucial cellular signaling pathways. Many IDPs undergo transitions from disordered conformational ensembles to folded structures upon binding to their cellular targets. Several possible binding mechanisms for coupled folding and binding have been identified: folding of the IDP after association with the target (&quot;induced fit&quot;), or binding of a prefolded state in the conformational ensemble of the IDP to the target protein (&quot;conformational selection&quot;), or some combination of these two extremes. The interaction of the intrinsically disordered phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain (pKID) of the cAMP-response element binding (CREB) protein with the KIX domain of a general transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) provides an example of the induced-fit mechanism. Here we show by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments that a different intrinsically disordered ligand, the transactivation domain of the transcription factor c-Myb, interacts with KIX at the same site as pKID but via a different binding mechanism that involves elements of conformational selection and induced fit. In contrast to pKID, the c-Myb activation domain has a strong propensity for spontaneous helix formation in its N-terminal region, which binds to KIX in a predominantly folded conformation. The C-terminal region of c-Myb exhibits a much smaller helical propensity and likely folds via an induced-fit process after binding to KIX. We propose that the intrinsic secondary structure propensities of pKID and c-Myb determine their binding mechanisms, consistent with their functions as inducible and constitutive transcriptional activator.
(Bucentaur) superfamily is classified by an uncharacteristic conserved sequence of ∼80 amino acids (aa) at the C-terminus, BCNT-C (the conserved C-terminal region of Bcnt/Cfdp1). Whereas the yeast Swc5 and Drosophila Yeti homologues play crucial roles in chromatin remodelling organization, mammalian Bcnt/Cfdp1 (craniofacial developmental protein 1) remains poorly understood. The protein, which lacks cysteine, is largely disordered and comprises an acidic N-terminal region, a lysine/glutamic acid/proline-rich 40 aa sequence and BCNT-C. It shows complex mobility on SDS/PAGE at ∼50&nbsp;kDa, whereas its calculated molecular mass is ∼33&nbsp;kDa. To characterize this mobility discrepancy and the effects of post-translational modifications (PTMs), we expressed various deleted His-Bcnt in E. coli and HEK cells and found that an acidic stretch in the N-terminal region is a main cause of the gel shift. Exogenous BCNT/CFDP1 constitutively expressed in HEK clones appears as a doublet at 49 and 47&nbsp;kDa, slower than the protein expressed in Escherichia coli but faster than the endogenous protein on SDS/PAGE. Among seven in&nbsp;vivo phosphorylation sites, Ser(250), which resides in a region between disordered and ordered regions in BCNT-C, is heavily phosphorylated and detected predominantly in the 49&nbsp;kDa band. Together with experiments involving treatment with phosphatases and Ser(250) substitutions, the results indicate that the complex behaviour of Bcnt/Cfdp1 on SDS/PAGE is caused mainly by an acidic stretch in the N-terminal region and Ser(250) phosphorylation in BCNT-C. Furthermore, Bcnt/Cfdp1 is acetylated in&nbsp;vitro by CREB-binding protein (CBP) and four lysine residues including Lys(268) in BCNT-C are also acetylated in&nbsp;vivo, revealing a protein regulated at multiple level.
L1 is a key transcription factor complex of the molecular clock system that generates circadian gene expression and physiology in mammals. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation of BMAL1 mediates the rapid activation of CLOCK-BMAL1 by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in nuclear foci and also the resetting of the circadian clock. Under physiological conditions, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BiFC-FRET) assay revealed that CLOCK-BMAL1 rapidly dimerized and formed a ternary complex with CBP in discrete nuclear foci in response to serum stimuli. We found that the formation of this ternary complex requires sumoylation of BMAL1 by SUMO3. These processes were abolished by both the ectopic expression of the SUMP2/3-specific protease, SUSP1, and mutation of the major sumoylation site (Lys(259)) of BMAL1. Moreover, molecular inhibition of BMAL1 sumoylation abrogated acute Per1 transcription and severely dampened the circadian gene oscillation triggered by clock synchronization stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest that sumoylation plays a critical role in the spatiotemporal co-activation of CLOCK-BMAL1 by CBP for immediate-early Per induction and the resetting of the circadian cloc.
mTOR signaling plays an important role in breast cancer. Its interaction with estrogen receptor (ER) signaling becomes more complex and interdependent with acquired endocrine resistance. Targeting mTOR combined with endocrine therapy has shown clinical utility; however, a negative feedback loop exists downstream of PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Direct blockade of AKT together with endocrine therapy may improve breast cancer treatment. AZD5363, a novel pan-AKT kinase catalytic inhibitor, was examined in a panel of ER(+) breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, HCC1428, T47D, ZR75.1) adapted to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) or tamoxifen (TamR). AZD5363 caused a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation in all cell lines tested (GI50 &lt; 500 nmol/L) except HCC1428 and HCC1428-LTED. T47D-LTED and ZR75-LTED were the most sensitive of the lines (GI50 ∼100 nmol/L). AZD5363 resensitized TamR cells to tamoxifen and acted synergistically with fulvestrant. AZD5363 decreased p-AKT/mTOR targets leading to a reduction in ERα-mediated transcription in a context-specific manner and concomitant decrease in recruitment of ER and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to estrogen response elements located on the TFF1, PGR, and GREB1 promoters. Furthermore, AZD5363 reduced expression of cell-cycle-regulatory proteins. Global gene expression highlighted ERBB2-ERBB3, ERK5, and IGFI signaling pathways driven by MYC as potential feedback-loops. Combined treatment with AZD5363 and fulvestrant showed synergy in an ER(+) patient-derived xenograft and delayed tumor progression after cessation of therapy. These data support the combination of AZD5363 with fulvestrant as a potential therapy for breast cancer that is sensitive or resistant to E-deprivation or tamoxifen and that activated AKT is a determinant of response, supporting the need for clinical evaluation.

ing protein (CBP) is a lysine acetyltransferase that regulates transcription by acetylating histone and non-histone substrates. Defects in CBP activity are associated with hematologic malignancies, neurodisorders, and congenital malformations. Sensitive and quantitative enzymatic assays are essential to better characterize the pathophysiological features of CBP. We describe a sensitive nonradioactive method to measure purified and immunopurified cellular CBP enzymatic activity through rapid reverse phase-ultra-fast liquid chromatography (RP-UFLC) analysis of fluorescent histone H3 peptide substrates. The applicability and biological relevance of the assay are supported by kinetic, inhibition, and immunoprecipitation studies. More broadly, this approach could be easily adapted to assay other lysine acetyltransferases or methyltransferase.
e the effects of moxibustion on factors related with apoptosis of myocardial cells after sports fatigue in mice as well as the relationship among histone acetyltransferases p300 (p300), CREB binding protein (CBP) and cell apoptosis to discuss the role of p300 and CBP in moxibustion against apoptosis of myocardial cell.
an-grade male Kunming mice were randomly divided into a control group, a sport group and a moxibustion group, 20 cases in each one. Mice in all group received identical feeding environment. Mice in the control group did not received sport nor moxibustion; mice in the sport group and moxibustion group received non-weight swimming training which lasted from 30 min per day to 90 min per day gradually for 21 days; 1 h after swimming training, mice in the moxibustion group received moxibustion with seed-sized moxa cone at &quot;Zusanli&quot; (ST 36) and &quot;Guanyuan&quot; (CV 4), 5 cones at each acupoint, once a day for 21 days. 24 h after the final swimming training, cardiac muscle tissue was collected to test factor associated suicide (Fas), B cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bcl-2) by immunohistochemical method and expression of p300 and CB.
with the control group, the apoptosis rate of myocardial cells in the sport group was significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), and apoptosis body with dense distribution and deep coloring can be seen in the field of microscope; the expression of Fas protein was significantly increased (P&lt;0.01), and expression of Bcl-2, p300 and CBP was reduced (all P&lt;0.01). The equally distributed apoptosis body with slight coloring was seen in the moxibustion group. Compared with the sport group, the apoptosis rate of myocardial cells in the moxibustion group was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05); the expression of Fas protein was significantly reduced (P&lt;0.05), and expression of Bcl-2, p300 and CBP was increased (all P&lt;0.05.
on could promote the expression of p300 and CBP in myocardial cells after sports fatigue in mice to inhibit the starting of apoptotic process, therefore reducing the apoptosis of myocardial cells after heavy exercise and protecting heart functio.
 (5-HT) has been reported to be involved in cancer progression by stimulating angiogenesis and cell growth. In this study, we examined the expression of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating the 5-HTT gene in tumor cells. The 5-HTT gene expression was almost silenced in chicken lymphoma DT40, myelomonocytic tumor HD11 and hepatoma DU249 cells, compared to their physiological counterpart. In contrast, HDAC1 mRNA expression was increased in these cell lines. Indeed, the pan-HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) enhanced the 5-HTT mRNA expression in several tumor cell lines including the human cell lines HepG2 and THP-1 and increased the 5-HT uptake in HD11 cells. In addition, treatment with parthenolide, which is capable of depleting HDAC1, and knockdown of HDAC1 using siRNA resulted in increased 5-HTT mRNA expression, confirming the role of HDAC1 in the down-regulation of 5-HTT in the tumor cells. Deletion analysis of the 5-HTT promoter and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPß), in interacting with the 5-HTT promoter, mediated both the inhibition of the 5-HTT expression by HDAC1 and the activation by CREB-binding protein (CBP). Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found increased acetylation of histone H4 associated with the 5-HTT promoter in cells treated with TSA. Our results suggest that the 5-HTT gene is epigenetically downregulated by HDAC1 in several types of cance.
n of RNA polymerase II transcription is critical for the proper development, differentiation, and growth of an organism. The RNA polymerase II core promoter is the ultimate target of a multitude of transcription factors that control transcription initiation. Core promoters encompass the RNA start site and consist of functional elements such as the TATA box, initiator, and downstream core promoter element (DPE), which confer specific properties to the core promoter. We have previously discovered that Drosophila Caudal, which is a master regulator of genes involved in development and differentiation, is a DPE-specific transcriptional activator. Here, we show that the mouse Caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) proteins (mCdx1, mCdx2, and mCdx4) are also preferential core promoter transcriptional activators. To elucidate the mechanism that enables Caudal to preferentially activate DPE transcription, we performed structure-function analysis. Using a systematic series of deletion mutants (all containing the intact DNA-binding homeodomain) we discovered that the C-terminal region of Caudal contributes to the preferential activation of the fushi tarazu (ftz) Caudal target gene. Furthermore, the region containing both the homeodomain and the C terminus of Caudal was sufficient to confer core promoter-preferential activation to the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Importantly, we discovered that Drosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) is a co-activator for Caudal-regulated activation of ftz. Strikingly, dCBP conferred the ability to preferentially activate the DPE-dependent ftz reporter to mini-Caudal proteins that were unable to preferentially activate ftz transcription themselves. Taken together, it is the unique combination of dCBP and Caudal that enables the co-activation of ftz in a core promoter-preferential manne.
 arsenic exposure has been shown to cause several detrimental effects in adults. However its effects following prenatal exposure are not well defined at the epigenetic level, particularly in terms of changes which may predispose an individual to adult malignancies. In this work, we have studied the effect of arsenic exposure on renal system using human embryonic kidney cells and prenatally exposed animals and identified Interleukin-8(IL-8) and its homologue (CINC-1) as mediators of arsenic induced renal toxicity. We further show that embryonic kidney cells are more responsive to arsenic leading to higher induction of IL-8 as compared to adult cells due to DNA methylation and histone acetylation (H3 acetylation) changes in the IL-8 promoter. Through bisulfite analysis of the IL-8 promoter, we have also identified an arsenic modulated CpG site at -168 bases upstream of transcription start site. This CpG is associated with C/EBP and CREB binding sites in the IL-8 promoter and its demethylation by arsenic coupled with increased H3 histone acetylation and CBP/P300 recruitment could lead to induction of IL-8. Our study shows how epigenetic modulation of IL-8 by arsenic could contribute to increased cell migratory and proliferative capabilities, cell cycle dysregulation and renal toxicit.
e hyper-activation of WNT signaling in a variety of cancer types, there has been a strong drive to develop pathway-specific inhibitors with the eventual goal of providing a chemotherapeutic antagonist of WNT signaling to cancer patients. A new category of drugs, called epigenetic inhibitors, are being developed that hold high promise for inhibition of the WNT pathway. The canonical WNT signaling pathway initiates when WNT ligands bind to receptors, causing the nuclear localization of the co-activator β-catenin (CTNNB1), which leads to an association of β-catenin with a member of the TCF transcription factor family at regulatory regions of WNT-responsive genes. The TCF/β-catenin complex then recruits CBP (CREBBP) or p300 (EP300), leading to histone acetylation and gene activation. A current model in the field is that CBP-driven expression of WNT target genes supports proliferation whereas p300-driven expression of WNT target genes supports differentiation. The small molecule inhibitor ICG-001 binds to CBP, but not to p300, and competitively inhibits the interaction of CBP with β-catenin. Upon treatment of cancer cells, this should reduce expression of CBP-regulated transcription, leading to reduced tumorigenicity and enhanced differentiatio.
ompared the genome-wide effects on the transcriptome after treatment with ICG-001 (the specific CBP inhibitor) versus C646, a compound that competes with acetyl-coA for the Lys-coA binding pocket of both CBP and p300. We found that both drugs cause large-scale changes in the transcriptome of HCT116 colon cancer cells and PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells and reverse some tumor-specific changes in gene expression. Interestingly, although the epigenetic inhibitors affect cell cycle pathways in both the colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines, the WNT signaling pathway was affected only in the colon cancer cells. Notably, WNT target genes were similarly downregulated after treatment of HCT116 with C646 as with ICG-00.
ts suggest that treatment with a general HAT inhibitor causes similar effects on the transcriptome as does treatment with a CBP-specific inhibitor and that epigenetic inhibition affects the WNT pathway in HCT116 cells and the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in PANC1 cell.
very of functional crosstalk between WNT and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling has established a more complex role for these two pathways in inflammation and cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of the crosstalk and its biological consequences are largely unknown. Here, we show that WNT/β-catenin signaling selectively inhibits the expression of a proinflammatory subset of IL-1β-induced NF-κB target genes. WNT/β-catenin signaling does not affect nuclear translocation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB or its association with CBP (also known as CREBBP), but reduces CBP-mediated acetylation and chromatin recruitment of RelA. Thus, β-catenin selectively regulates NF-κB gene expression through its negative effects on RelA acetylation. This anti-inflammatory effect may be relevant for cancer treatmen.
de distribution of histone H3K18 and H3K27 acetyltransferases, CBP (CREBBP) and p300 (EP300), is used to map enhancers and promoters, but whether these elements functionally require CBP/p300 remains largely uncertain. Here we compared global CBP recruitment with gene expression in wild-type and CBP/p300 double-knockout (dKO) fibroblasts. ChIP-seq using CBP-null cells as a control revealed nearby CBP recruitment for 20% of constitutively-expressed genes, but surprisingly, three-quarters of these genes were unaffected or slightly activated in dKO cells. Computationally defined enhancer-promoter-units (EPUs) having a CBP peak near the enhancer-like element were more predictive, with CBP/p300 deletion attenuating expression of 40% of such constitutively-expressed genes. Examining signal-responsive (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) genes showed that 97% were within 50 kilobases of an inducible CBP peak, and 70% of these required CBP/p300 for full induction. Unexpectedly, most inducible CBP peaks occurred near signal-nonresponsive genes. Finally, single-cell expression analysis revealed additional context dependence where some signal-responsive genes were not uniformly dependent on CBP/p300 in individual cells. While CBP/p300 was needed for full induction of some genes in single-cells, for other genes CBP/p300 increased the probability of maximal expression. Thus, target gene context influences the transcriptional requirement for CBP/p300, possibly by multiple mechanism.
esses in endothelial cells including angiogenic responses are regulated by microRNAs. However, there is limited information available about their complex cross-talk in regulating certain endothelial function.
tive of this study is to identify endothelial functions of the pro-hypertrophic miR-212/132 cluster and its cross-talk with other microRNAs during development and diseas.
how that anti-angiogenic stimulation by transforming growth factor-beta activates the microRNA-212/132 cluster by derepression of their transcriptional co-activator cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) which is a novel target of a previously identified pro-angiogenic miRNA miR-30a-3p in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, despite having the same seed-sequence, miR-212 and miR-132 exerted differential effects on endothelial transcriptome regulation and cellular functions with stronger endothelial inhibitory effects caused by miR-212. These differences could be attributed to additional auxiliary binding of miR-212 to its targets. In vivo, deletion of the miR-212/132 cluster increased endothelial vasodilatory function, improved angiogenic responses during postnatal development and in adult mic.
ts identify (i) a novel miRNA-cross-talk involving miR-30a-3p and miR-212, which led to suppression of important endothelial genes such as GAB1 and SIRT1 finally culminating in impaired endothelial function; and (ii) microRNAs may have different biological roles despite having the same seed sequenc.
e-dependent gene transcription is required for nervous system development and function. However, the DNA regulatory elements that control this program of gene expression are not well defined. Here we characterize the enhancers that function across the genome to mediate activity-dependent transcription in mouse cortical neurons. We find that the subset of enhancers enriched for monomethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me1) and binding of the transcriptional coactivator CREBBP (also called CBP) that shows increased acetylation of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27ac) after membrane depolarization of cortical neurons functions to regulate activity-dependent transcription. A subset of these enhancers appears to require binding of FOS, which was previously thought to bind primarily to promoters. These findings suggest that FOS functions at enhancers to control activity-dependent gene programs that are critical for nervous system function and provide a resource of functional cis-regulatory elements that may give insight into the genetic variants that contribute to brain development and diseas.
c ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer due in part to a lack of highly robust cytotoxic or molecular-based therapies. Recent studies investigating ligand-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling have highlighted its importance in pancreatic cancer initiation and progression, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC. The small-molecule ICG-001 binds cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) to disrupt its interaction with β-catenin and inhibit CBP function as a coactivator of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. Given its ability to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription in vitro and in vivo, as well as its efficacy in preclinical models of colorectal cancer and other Wnt-driven diseases, we examined ICG-001 and its potential role as a therapeutic in PDAC. ICG-001 alone significantly inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of multiple PDAC lines, and augmented in vitro growth inhibition when used in combination with gemcitabine. ICG-001 had only variable modest effects on PDAC apoptosis and instead mediated PDAC growth inhibition primarily through robust induction of G₁ cell-cycle arrest. These effects, however, seemed decoupled from its inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. DNA microarrays performed on PDAC cells in the context of ICG-001 treatment revealed ICG-001 altered the expression of several genes with well-established roles in DNA replication and cell-cycle progression, including direct actions on SKP2 and CDKN1A. ICG-001 also significantly prolonged survival in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft model of PDAC, indicating ICG-001 or derived compounds that disrupt CBP activity are potentially useful small-molecule therapeutics for pancreatic cance.
l mechanisms underlying the attainment of fear memory accuracy for appropriate discriminative responses to aversive and nonaversive stimuli are unclear. Considerable evidence indicates that coactivator of transcription and histone acetyltransferase cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is critically required for normal neural function. CBP hypofunction leads to severe psychopathological symptoms in human and cognitive abnormalities in genetic mutant mice with severity dependent on the neural locus and developmental time of the gene inactivation. Here, we showed that an acute hypofunction of CBP in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) results in a disruption of fear memory accuracy in mice. In addition, interruption of CREB function in the mPFC also leads to a deficit in auditory discrimination of fearful stimuli. While mice with deficient CBP/CREB signaling in the mPFC maintain normal responses to aversive stimuli, they exhibit abnormal responses to similar but nonrelevant stimuli when compared to control animals. These data indicate that improvement of fear memory accuracy involves mPFC-dependent suppression of fear responses to nonrelevant stimuli. Evidence from a context discriminatory task and a newly developed task that depends on the ability to distinguish discrete auditory cues indicated that CBP-dependent neural signaling within the mPFC circuitry is an important component of the mechanism for disambiguating the meaning of fear signals with two opposing values: aversive and nonaversiv.
ecule inhibitors that target bromodomains outside of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) sub-family are lacking. Here, we describe highly potent and selective ligands for the bromodomain module of the human lysine acetyl transferase CBP/p300, developed from a series of 5-isoxazolyl-benzimidazoles. Our starting point was a fragment hit, which was optimized into a more potent and selective lead using parallel synthesis employing Suzuki couplings, benzimidazole-forming reactions, and reductive aminations. The selectivity of the lead compound against other bromodomain family members was investigated using a thermal stability assay, which revealed some inhibition of the structurally related BET family members. To address the BET selectivity issue, X-ray crystal structures of the lead compound bound to the CREB binding protein (CBP) and the first bromodomain of BRD4 (BRD4(1)) were used to guide the design of more selective compounds. The crystal structures obtained revealed two distinct binding modes. By varying the aryl substitution pattern and developing conformationally constrained analogues, selectivity for CBP over BRD4(1) was increased. The optimized compound is highly potent (Kd = 21 nM) and selective, displaying 40-fold selectivity over BRD4(1). Cellular activity was demonstrated using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) and a p53 reporter assay. The optimized compounds are cell-active and have nanomolar affinity for CBP/p300; therefore, they should be useful in studies investigating the biological roles of CBP and p300 and to validate the CBP and p300 bromodomains as therapeutic target.
-secreted luteinizing hormone (LH) induces ovulation by activating an extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade. However, little is known regarding the ERK1/2 downstream effectors that are involved in regulating rapid, transient expression of LH-target gene in ovulatory follicles. By comparing the gene expression profiles of LH-stimulated wild type with ERK1/2-deleted ovarian granulosa cells (GCs), we identified Cited4 as a previously unknown LH target gene during ovulation. LH induced Cited4 expression in pre-ovulatory follicles in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. CITED4 formed an endogenous protein complex and docked on the promoters of LH and ERK1/2 target genes. Both CITED4 expression and CBP acetyltransferase activity leading to histone acetylation were indispensable for LH-induced ovulation-related events. LH induced dynamic histone acetylation changes in pre-ovulatory GCs, including the acetylation of histone H2B (Lys5) and H3 (Lys9). This was essential for the rapid responses and dramatic increases of LH target gene expressions by the ordered activation of ERK1/2 and CITED4-CBP. In addition, histone deacetylases (HDACs) antagonized CITED4-CBP to turn off expression of these genes after exposure to LH. Thus, we determined that CITED4 was a novel LH and ERK1/2 target for triggering ovulation. These results support the proposition that LH induces rapid, significant gene expression in pre-ovulatory follicles by modulating histone acetylation statu.
sformation is clearly linked to epigenetic changes. However, the role of the histone-modifying enzymes in this process is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes to Ras-mediated transformation. Our results demonstrated that lysine acetyltransferase 5, also known as Tip60, facilitates histone acetylation of bulk chromatin in Ras-transformed cells. As a consequence, global H4 acetylation (H4K8ac and H4K12ac) increases in Ras-transformed cells, rendering a more decompacted chromatin than in parental cells. Furthermore, low levels of CREB-binding protein (CBP) lead to hypoacetylation of retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (Cdkn1b or p27Kip1) tumour suppressor gene promoters to facilitate Ras-mediated transformation. In agreement with these data, overexpression of Cbp counteracts Ras transforming capability in a HAT-dependent manner. Altogether our results indicate that CBP and Tip60 coordinate histone acetylation at both local and global levels to facilitate Ras-induced transformatio.
, an isoflavone present in soy products, has chemopreventive effects on mammary carcinogenesis. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of genistein on phorbol ester-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that plays an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. Pretreatment of cultured human breast epithelial (MCF10A) cells with genistein reduced COX-2 expression induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). There are multiple lines of evidence supporting that the induction of COX-2 is regulated by the eukaryotic transcription factor NF-κB. Genistein failed to inhibit TPA-induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB as well as degradation of IκB. However, genistein abrogated the TPA-induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB as determined by the luciferase reporter gene assay. Genistein inhibited phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and its interaction with cAMP regulatory element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and TATA-binding protein (TBP). TPA-induced NF-κB phosphorylation was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Likewise, pharmacologic inhibition or dominant negative mutation of ERK suppressed phosphorylation of p65. The above findings, taken together, suggest that genistein inhibits TPA-induced COX-2 expression in MCF10A cells by blocking ERK-mediated phosphorylation of p65 and its subsequent interaction with CBP and TB.
as been reported to regulate both stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Wnt signaling is also a key regulator in stem cells. The recent discovery of functional cross-regulation between the Wnt pathway and HIF-1α/HIF-2α signaling further highlights the complexity of the role of hypoxia in the regulation of stem cells. In this report we reveal that human CML cell lines treated under hypoxic conditions increase the percentage of leukemia stem/initiating-like cells, as judged by surface marker expression, colony forming ability and quiescence. We demonstrate that differential usage of the Kat3 coactivators, CREBBP/Creb Binding Protein (CBP) and EP300 (p300) by catenin, with increased CBP/catenin signaling at the expense of p300/catenin signaling, is mechanistically correlated with the increase in the leukemia stem/initiating-like population. A specific small molecule inhibitor of CBP/catenin dependent transcription, ICG-001, can reverse these effects further demonstrating the critical involvement of CBP/catenin signaling in enhancing and maintaining the leukemia stem/initiating-like cell population under hypoxic condition.
 regain of interest recently in ERK3 kinase signaling, the molecular regulations of both ERK3 gene expression and protein kinase activity are still largely unknown. While it is shown that disruption of ERK3 gene causes neonatal lethality, cell type-specific functions of ERK3 signaling remain to be explored. In this study, we report that ERK3 gene expression is upregulated by cytokines through c-Jun in endothelial cells; c-Jun binds to the ERK3 gene and regulates its transcription. We further reveal a new role for ERK3 in regulating endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation by upregulating SRC-3/SP-1-mediated VEGFR2 expression. The underlying molecular mechanism involves ERK3-stimulated formation of a transcriptional complex involving coactivator SRC-3, transcription factor SP-1 and the secondary coactivator CBP. Taken together, our study identified a molecular regulatory mechanism of ERK3 gene expression and revealed a previously unknown role of ERK3 in regulating endothelial cell function.
igate the correlation among p300, CBP and MLL expression and the clinicopathological characteristics in resected SCLC patient.
ed and twenty-two resected SCLC patients were included in this study. We evaluated p300, CBP and MLL expression by immunohistochemistr.
with high p300 expression had shorter OS and DFS than those with low p300 expression (p = 0.01; p = 0.009, respectively). The patients with CBP-positive tumors had significantly lower OS and DFS than those with CBP-negative tumors (p = 0.005 and p = 0.007, respectively). Moreover, the p300- and CBP-positive (+) group had a significantly poor OS and DFS. The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high p300 and CBP expression are independent markers of poor overall survival (p = 0.006; p = 0.017, respectively) in operable SCLC patient.
 and CBP expression are independent prognostic markers of poor overall survival for resected SCLC patients. The combination of p300 and CBP expression may be useful in identifying patients with increased risks of cancer recurrence of SCL.
ne DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a multifunctional enzyme, which is essential for embryonic development. It mediates the base excision repair (BER) of G:T and G:U DNA mismatches arising from the deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (5-MeC) and cytosine, respectively. Recent studies have pointed at a role of TDG during the active demethylation of 5-MeC within CpG islands. TDG interacts with the histone acetylase CREB-binding protein (CBP) to activate CBP-dependent transcription. In addition, TDG also interacts with the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), resulting in the activation of RARα target genes. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a functional ternary complex containing TDG, CBP and activated RARα. Using global transcriptome profiling, we uncover a coupling of de novo methylation-sensitive and RA-dependent transcription, which coincides with a significant subset of CBP target genes. The introduction of a point mutation in TDG, which neither affects overall protein structure nor BER activity, leads to a significant loss in ternary complex stability, resulting in the deregulation of RA targets involved in cellular networks associated with DNA replication, recombination and repair. We thus demonstrate for the first time a direct coupling of TDG's epigenomic and transcription regulatory function through ternary complexes with CBP and RAR.
od cell production or definitive hematopoiesis requires the transcription factor c-Myb. The closely related KAT3 histone acetyltransferases CBP (CREBBP) and p300 (EP300) bind c-Myb through their KIX domains and mice homozygous for a p300 KIX domain mutation exhibit multiple blood defects. Perplexingly, mice homozygous for the same KIX domain mutation in CBP have normal blood. Here we test the hypothesis that the CBP KIX domain contributes subordinately to hematopoiesis via a genetic interaction with c-Myb. We assessed hematopoiesis in mice bearing compound mutations of c-Myb and/or the KIX domains of CBP and p300, and measured the effect of KIX domain mutations on c-Myb-dependent gene expression. We found that in the context of a p300 KIX mutation, the CBP KIX domain mutation affects platelets, B cells, T cells, and red cells. Gene interaction (epistasis) analysis provides mechanistic evidence that blood defects in KIX mutant mice are consistent with reduced c-Myb and KIX interaction. Lastly, we demonstrated that the CBP and p300 KIX domains contribute to both c-Myb-dependent gene activation and repression. Together these results suggest that the KIX domains of CBP, and especially p300, are principal mediators of c-Myb-dependent gene activation and repression that is required for definitive hematopoiesi.
 are extensively involved in the pathogenesis of major cardiovascular diseases by suppressing target gene expression. Recent studies have reported that microRNA-22 (miR-22) may be implicated in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced myocardial injury. However, the specific function of miR-22 in myocardial I/R injury is far from clear nowadays. The present study was designed to determine the role of miR-22 in myocardial I/R injury and investigate the underlying cardio-protective mechanism. The rat myocardial I/R injury model was induced by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by 12 h reperfusion. As predicted, adenovirus-mediated miR-22 overexpression markedly reduced the release of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, infarct size and cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Moreover, CREB binding protein (CBP) as a potential miR-22 target by bioinformatics was significantly inhibited after miR-22 transfection. We also found that p53 acetylation activity, pro-apoptotic related genes Bax and p21 levels were all decreased associated with the down-regulation of CBP. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that miR-22 could inhibit apoptosis of cardiomyocytes through one of its targets, CBP. Thus, miR-22 may constitute a new therapeutic target for the prevention of myocardial I/R injur.
etyltransferases (KATs), p300 (KAT3B), and its close homologue CREB-binding protein (KAT3A) are probably the most widely studied KATs with well documented roles in various cellular processes. Hence, the dysfunction of p300 may result in the dysregulation of gene expression leading to the manifestation of many disorders. The acetyltransferase activity of p300/CREB-binding protein is therefore considered as a target for new generation therapeutics. We describe here a natural compound, plumbagin (RTK1), isolated from Plumbago rosea root extract, that inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity potently in vivo. Interestingly, RTK1 specifically inhibits the p300-mediated acetylation of p53 but not the acetylation by another acetyltransferase, p300/CREB-binding protein -associated factor, PCAF, in vivo. RTK1 inhibits p300 histone acetyltransferase activity in a noncompetitive manner. Docking studies and site-directed mutagenesis of the p300 histone acetyltransferase domain suggest that a single hydroxyl group of RTK1 makes a hydrogen bond with the lysine 1358 residue of this domain. In agreement with this, we found that indeed the hydroxyl group-substituted plumbagin derivatives lost the acetyltransferase inhibitory activity. This study describes for the first time the chemical entity (hydroxyl group) required for the inhibition of acetyltransferase activit.
tro perfused rectal gland of the dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) and filter-grown monolayers of primary cultures of shark rectal gland (SRG) epithelial cells were used to analyze the signal transduction pathway by which C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulates chloride secretion. CNP binds to natriuretic receptors in the basolateral membrane, elevates cellular cGMP, and opens cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channels in the apical membrane. CNP-provoked chloride secretion was completely inhibitable by the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the PKA inhibitor H89 but insensitive to H8, an inhibitor of type I and II isoforms of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI and cGKII). CNP-induced secretion could not be mimicked by nonhydrolyzable cGMP analogs added alone or in combination with the protein kinase C activator phorbolester, arguing against a role for cGK or for cGMP-induced PKC signaling. We failed to detect a dogfish ortholog of cGKII by molecular cloning and affinity chromatography. However, inhibitors of the cGMP-inhibitable isoform of phosphodiesterase (PDE3) including milrinone, amrinone, and cilostamide but not inhibitors of other PDE isoenzymes mimicked the effect of CNP on chloride secretion in perfused glands and monolayers. CNP raised cGMP and cAMP levels in the SRG epithelial cells. This rise in cAMP as well as the CNP and amrinone-provoked chloride secretion, but not the rise in cGMP, was almost completely blocked by the Gαi-coupled adenylyl cyclase inhibitor somatostatin, arguing against a role for cGMP cross-activation of PKA in CNP action. These data provide molecular, functional, and pharmacological evidence for a CNP/cGMP/PDE3/cAMP/PKA signaling cascade coupled to CFTR in the SR.
melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ2MSH) is a peptide hormone released by the pituitary gland which is thought to act directly on the renal inner medulla to promote increased sodium excretion into urine (natriuresis). The aim of this study was to determine if a stable analog, [Nle(3), D-Phe(6)]-γ2MSH (NDP-γ2MSH), of the native peptide regulated the activity, expression and cellular localization of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in a murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) cell line. Our results indicate that expression of the γ2MSH receptor, melanocortin receptor 3 receptor (MC3R), is up-regulated by culturing the cells in media with an increased osmolality (∼400mOsm/kg). Furthermore, stimulation of cAMP signaling and sodium transport by 1nM NDP-γ2MSH occurs only in cells cultured in the high osmolality media. Finally, treatment of mIMCD-3 cells cultured in high osmolality medium for 1h with 1nM NDP-γ2MSH causes a reduction in expression of serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (sgk1) and a reduction in expression and cell surface abundance of the alpha subunit of ENaC. Collectively, this data suggest that γ2MSH directly regulates both ENaC expression and cellular localization in the inner medulla to exert its natriuretic effec.
 (2 min) nongenomic effects of aldosterone (ALDO) and/or spironolactone (MR antagonist), RU 486 (GR antagonist), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and dimethyl-BAPTA (BAPTA) on the intracellular pH recovery rate (pHirr) via NHE1 (basolateral Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger isoform), after the acid load induced by NH₄Cl, and on the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺](i)) were investigated in the proximal S3 segment isolated from rats, by the probes BCECF-AM and FLUO-4-AM, respectively. The basal pHi was 7.15±0.008 and the basal pHirr was 0.195±0.012 pH units/min (number of tubules/number of tubular areas=16/96). Our results confirmed the rapid biphasic effect of ALDO on NHE1: ALDO (10⁻¹² M) increases the pHirr to approximately 59% of control value, and ALDO (10⁻⁶ M) decreases it to approximately 49%. Spironolactone did not change these effects, but RU 486 inhibited the stimulatory effect and maintained the inhibitory effect. ANP (10⁻⁶ M) or BAPTA (5×10⁻⁵ M) alone had no significant effect on NHE1 but prevented both effects of ALDO on this exchanger. The basal [Ca²⁺](i) was 104±3 nM (15), and ALDO (10⁻¹² or 10⁻⁶ M) increased the basal [Ca²⁺](i) to approximately 50% or 124%, respectively. RU 486, ANP and BAPTA decreased the [Ca²⁺](i) and inhibited the stimulatory effect of both doses of ALDO. The results suggest the involvement of GR on the nongenomic effects of ALDO and indicate a pHirr-regulating role for [Ca²⁺](i) that is mediated by NHE1, stimulated/impaired by ALDO, and affected by ANP or BAPTA with ALDO. The observed nongenomic hormonal interaction in the S3 segment may represent a rapid and physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism in the intact animal under conditions of volume alteration.
receptor guanylate cyclase (GC-C) peaks in neonatal intestine and is involved in either enterocyte proliferation or chloride secretion. The latter is more potent when GC-C activator guanylin, or its analog Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), is added to the mucosal rather than serosal side of intestinal monolayers. By using Ussing chambers, we investigated transepithelial ion transport and enterocyte proliferation and their mechanisms in response to the addition of guanylin or ST to the mucosal or serosal side of Caco-2 monolayers and in ileal specimens from neonates. GC-C activation showed a polar pattern of the effects. GC-C mucosal activation resulted in a potent cGMP-chloride secretion activation and in a marginal enterocyte proliferation. Conversely, serosal GC-C activation induced a potent enterocyte proliferation, through MAP kinase ERK 1/2. Finally, the inhibition of ERK1/2 enhanced the Isc increase in response to serosal but not to mucosal ST stimulation, indicating that ERK1/2 also acts as a brake of chloride secretion. These data suggest that the guanylin/GC-C system plays a key role in early postnatal intestinal adaptation exploiting the polar structure of enterocyt.
ng of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to its receptor requires chloride, and it is chloride concentration dependent. The extracellular domain (ECD) of the ANP receptor (ANPR) contains a chloride near the ANP-binding site, suggesting a possible regulatory role. The bound chloride, however, is completely buried in the polypeptide fold, and its functional role has remained unclear. Here, we have confirmed that chloride is necessary for ANP binding to the recombinant ECD or the full-length ANPR expressed in CHO cells. ECD without chloride (ECD(-)) did not bind ANP. Its binding activity was fully restored by bromide or chloride addition. A new X-ray structure of the bromide-bound ECD is essentially identical to that of the chloride-bound ECD. Furthermore, bromide atoms are localized at the same positions as chloride atoms both in the apo and in the ANP-bound structures, indicating exchangeable and reversible halide binding. Far-UV CD and thermal unfolding data show that ECD(-) largely retains the native structure. Sedimentation equilibrium in the absence of chloride shows that ECD(-) forms a strongly associated dimer, possibly preventing the structural rearrangement of the two monomers that is necessary for ANP binding. The primary and tertiary structures of the chloride-binding site in ANPR are highly conserved among receptor-guanylate cyclases and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The chloride-dependent ANP binding, reversible chloride binding, and the highly conserved chloride-binding site motif suggest a regulatory role for the receptor bound chloride. Chloride-dependent regulation of ANPR may operate in the kidney, modulating ANP-induced natriuresi.
ic peptides bind with natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-C, which can alter cellular function through its interaction with the G(i) protein complex. NPR-C has been found to mediate the activation of K(+) channels and non-selective cation channels in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac fibroblast cells, respectively. However, the electrophysiological effect of NPR-C activation on endothelial cells (EC) has not been previously examined. In this study we sought to elucidate the effect of cANF(4-23), a selective NPR-C ligand, on EC membrane potential (E(m).
n EC E(m) was measured through non-invasive fluorescence imaging. EC were preincubated in the potentiometric dye, DiBAC(4)(3) and subsequently exposed to cANF(4-23), in the presence of selective inhibitors of ion-channels or second messengers. NPR-C expression in rat lung microvascular endothelial cells was assessed by RT-PCR. cANF(4-23) induced a sustained decrease in EC cellular fluorescence, indicating endothelial cell hyperpolarization. The cANF-induced hyperpolarization could not be attenuated by TEA, barium, ouabain or by the reduction of extracellular Ca(2+). Further, the cANF-induced hyperpolarization was insensitive to inhibition of G(i) and protein kinase G (PKG), downstream messengers of NPRs. However, the Cl(-) channel inhibitors, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, niflumic acid, and hypertonic saline attenuated the cANF-induced hyperpolarization. Perforated patch clamp recordings confirmed the cANF-induced current was carried by Cl(-) and could be inhibited by niflumic acid. RT-PCR confirmed expression of NPR-C in vascular smooth muscle cells but not in E.
es hyperpolarization that is most likely mediated via activation of Cl(-) channels by a PKG and G(i) independent mechanis.
eart failure poses an enormous health care burden to the United States and other developed countries. Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) accounts for nearly half of the morbidity and expense of treating this disease. Most patients presenting with ADHF have symptomatic vascular congestion. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, are the primary pharmacologic intervention used in this population. Despite their widespread use, scant data from randomized clinical trials are available to guide therapeutic choices. In addition, data from several large registries examining weight loss during hospitalization for ADHF suggest that efficacy with diuretic treatment is far from universal. Aggressive diuresis carries a significant risk of electrolyte and volume depletion, with subsequent arrhythmias, hypotension, and worsening renal function. These complications often translate into worse prognosis. Diuretic regimens used to treat ADHF must be individualized based on general knowledge of potency and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. This article summarizes older and more recent literature to provide a framework for making rational treatment choices in this difficult patient populatio.
se of this animal study was to confirm the presence of all three atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor subtypes in the rat inner ear and compare the expression of each receptor after inner ear injection of ANP, phosphate-buffered saline, or a solution containing ANP incubated with anti-ANP antibody (to block upregulation.
 for ANP and related compounds have been localized in the inner ear of animals and humans. A previous study at this institution demonstrated the ability to up-regulate the expression of the three ANP receptors (ANP-A, ANP-B, ANP-C) in response to round window injection of ANP in the rat inner ea.
gical exposure, the round window of female Lewis rats was injected with various concentrations of ANP, ANP plus anti-ANP antibody, or control. Animals were killed 24 hours after injection, inner ear tissues were harvested and homogenized, and RNA was isolated for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactio.
oresis showed the presence of all three receptor subtypes with exposure to phosphate-buffered saline. Expression was significantly higher 24 hours after injection with the two concentrations of ANP. This increase was partially blocked with increasing relative concentrations of anti-ANP antibod.
dings confirm the presence and responsiveness of ANP receptors in the rat inner ear. The ability to block up-regulation with the antibody provides a potential new research tool for manipulating the function of this hormone system in experimental models and, ultimately, in understanding the mechanisms of fluid homeostasis in the inner ea.
 transient receptor potential (TRP) channels consist of six related protein sub-families that are involved in a variety of pathophysiological function, and disease development. The TRPV1 channel, a member of the TRPV sub-family, is identified by expression cloning using the &quot;hot&quot; pepper-derived vanilloid compound capsaicin as a ligand. Therefore, TRPV1 is also referred as the vanilloid receptor (VR1) or the capsaicin receptor. VR1 is mainly expressed in a subpopulation of primary afferent neurons that project to cardiovascular and renal tissues. These capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurons are not only involved in the perception of somatic and visceral pain, but also have a &quot;sensory-effector&quot; function. Regarding the latter, these neurons release stored neuropeptides through a calcium-dependent mechanism via the binding of capsaicin to VR1. The most studied sensory neuropeptides are calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP), which are potent vasodilators and natriuretic/diuretic factors. Recent evidence using the model of neonatal degeneration of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves revealed novel mechanisms that underlie increased salt sensitivity and several experimental models of hypertension. These mechanisms include insufficient suppression of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels subsequent to salt loading, enhancement of sympathoexcitatory response in the face of a salt challenge, activation of the endothelin-1 receptor, and impaired natriuretic response to salt loading in capsaicin-pretreated rats. These data indicate that sensory nerves counterbalance the prohypertensive effects of several neurohormonal systems to maintain normal blood pressure when challenged with salt loading. The therapeutic utilities of vanilloid compounds, endogenous agonists, and sensory neuropeptides are also discusse.
ry epithelium of bile ducts and gallbladder modifies the composition of primary hepatic bile by absorption and secretion of an electrolyte-rich fluid. The underlying transport mechanisms, however, are still incompletely understood. We investigated the expression, the cellular localization, and the functional role of guanylin, a bioactive intestinal peptide involved in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-regulated electrolyte/water secretion, in the human gallbladde.
pecific antibodies were raised to localize guanylin and its affiliated signaling proteins, i.e., the guanylin receptor, guanylate cyclase C (GC-C), cGMP-dependent protein kinase type II (cGKII), and CFTR in the human gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma cells (Mz-Cha-1) by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. A sensitive ELISA was used to assess the range of guanylin concentration in human bile fluid. The functional role of guanylin was investigated in subconfluent Mz-Cha-1 cell monolayers by isotope efflux experiment.
and its affiliated signaling proteins are highly expressed in the human gallbladder. Guanylin is localized to secretory epithelial cells of the gallbladder and is present in the bile, whereas GC-C, cGKII, and CFTR are confined exclusively to the apical membrane of the same epithelial cells. Functional studies in Mz-Cha-1 cells identify guanylin as a specific regulator of biliary Cl(-) secretion that very likely is mediated by an intracellular increase of cGMP-concentratio.
the present findings and on the functional role of guanylin in other epithelia, it is likely that gallbladder epithelial cells synthesize and release guanylin into the bile to regulate electrolyte secretion by a paracrine/luminocrine signaling pathwa.
ensive rats, we have previously demonstrated a role of brain mineralocorticoid receptors in blood pressure and renal function control. In the present study, the coordinate cardiovascular and renal effects of brain mineralocorticoid receptor blockade were examined by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (RU28318; 3,3-oxo-7 propyl-17-hydroxy-androstan-4-en-17yl-propionic acid lactone) in rats with hypertension induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and salt. DOCA pellets were implanted s.c. in male Wistar rats given 0.9% NaCl as drinking solution 3 or 5 weeks before assessment of the effects of i.c.v. injection of RU28318 on cardiovascular and renal functions. Changes in expression of brain angiotensinogen, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA in specific brain areas in 3-week DOCA-salt rats were evaluated by in situ hybridization. The rise in systolic blood pressure induced by DOCA-salt treatment was most marked during the first 3 weeks. At 3 and 5 weeks after implantation of the DOCA-pellets a single i.c.v. injection of 10 ng of RU28318 significantly decreased systolic blood pressure during 24 h as assessed at 2, 8 and 24 h, while heart rate was not altered. Increased urinary excretion of water and electrolytes was observed in 3- and 5-week DOCA-salt rats during the period 0-8 h after i.c.v. injection of RU28318 while the suppressed plasma renin activity was not affected. The expression of brain angiotensinogen, ANP and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA was not altered by 3-week DOCA-salt treatment, but 3 h after i.c.v. injection of RU28318, mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in hippocampal cell fields responded with an increase of about 40%. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that in rats with hypertension induced by DOCA-salt, brain mineralocorticoid receptor blockade affects renal function and blood pressure regulatio.
considerable evidence indicates a role for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in renal salt regulation, other studies have found a lack of natriuretic response to high-plasma ANF under certain physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The mechanism for this apparent insensitivity to ANF is unknown. In the present study, it was found that ANF binding to its receptor requires the presence of chloride and occurs in a chloride concentration-dependent manner. ANF binding was measured using the purified recombinant hormone-binding domain of the ANF receptor in the presence of 0.1 mol/L NaCl or other selected salt. High specific binding was detected in the presence of NaCl, KCl, or NH(4)Cl. However, binding was undetectable when the salt was replaced with NaHCO(3), CH(3)COONa, or CH(3)COONH(4), indicating that binding requires the presence of chloride. Chloride dependence was also found with the native receptor in bovine adrenocortical membrane preparations. ANF binding to the recombinant protein was chloride concentration-dependent over a range from 0.05 to 10 mmol/L, and a half-maximum binding was attained at approximately 0.6 mmol/L equivalent chloride concentration. Competitive-binding assays at several fixed concentrations of NaCl showed that lowering chloride concentration caused a decrease in maximum binding but did not alter K(d) values, suggesting that a loss of chloride turns off ANF binding rather than reducing affinity for ANF. Saturation-binding studies showed that excess ANF cannot overcome loss of binding caused by low chloride. Chloride-dependent ANF-receptor binding may function as a feedback-control mechanism regulating the ANF-receptor action and, hence, renal sodium excretio.
died the effects of selective chronic sodium depletion of chloride depletion on atrial natriuretic peptide receptor number in the subfornical organ and paraventricular nucleus of young rats. 2. Sodium or chloride depletion decreased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, increased plasma renin activity, and induced extracellular fluid volume contraction. Chloride depletion induced more significant changes in extracellular fluid volume contraction than sodium depletion. 3. In the subfornical organ, atrial natriuretic peptide receptor number significantly decreased (30%) after sodium depletion, while chloride depletion induced a smaller, not statistically significant decrease. Conversely, atrial natriuretic peptide receptors located in the paraventricular nucleus of young rats were not significantly affected by sodium or chloride depletion. 4. Water deprivation reversed the decrease in atrial natriuretic peptide receptors produced by sodium depletion. Water-deprived sodium-depleted rats actually had higher numbers of atrial natriuretic peptide receptors in the subfornical organ than control rats. These changes were associated with severe extracellular fluid volume contraction and up regulation of brain vasopressin mRNA steady-state levels. Thus, the direction of change in the number of subfornical organ atrial natriuretic peptide receptors was dependent on the degree of extracellular fluid volume contraction. 5. Our results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide receptors located in the subfornical organ, and not in the paraventricular nucleus, are selectively regulated by sodium depletion and extracellular fluid volume contractio.
 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) exhibited a modulatory role in the catalytic activation of guanylate cyclase-A/atrial natriuretic factor receptor (GC-A/ANF-R) in the plasma membrane preparations of murine Leydig tumor (MA-10) cells. Both atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and GTP gamma S synergistically stimulated the guanylate cyclase (GC) activity of GC-A/ANF-R in a dose- and time-related manner. Other nucleotides and their analogs such as ATP, adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate, adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate, GDP, and guanosine 5'-(2-O-thiodiphosphate) (100 microM each) did not show any discernible effect on GC catalytic activity of GC-A/ANF-R. A significant stimulation of GC activity was observed in the presence of mastoparan, AlF4-, and benzalkonium chloride. The saturation binding assay of [35S]GTP gamma S showed the dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.3 x 10(-9) M and the binding capacity (Bmax) of 76 pmol/mg protein in the plasma membrane preparations of MA-10 cells. ANF increased the [35S]GTP gamma S-binding capacity, however, without affecting its affinity constant. Pretreatment of plasma membranes with antibodies against Gs alpha subunit attenuates the GTP gamma S-stimulated GC activity, whereas antibodies against Gi alpha subunit enhanced the stimulatory effect of GTP gamma S on GC catalytic activity of GC-A/ANF-R. However, the antibodies against Go alpha subunit did not show any effect on GC activity. These results provide the evidence that both Gs and Gi subunits of G-proteins seem to be involved in the regulation of GC catalytic activity of GC-A/ANF-R in the plasma membranes of MA-10 cell.
ve antagonist for the cGMP-linked ANF receptor was used to assess inhibition of cardiovascular and renal actions of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). Two groups of anesthetized rats were injected with antagonist or vehicle, respectively, prior to an infusion of ANF. A third group received neither antagonist injection nor ANF infusion and served as a time control. Compared to ANF infusion alone, prior antagonist administration was associated with significant reduction of both the hypotension and hemoconcentration following peptide infusion, although significant residual effects were still present. Glomerular filtration rates during ANF infusion were significantly lower in the antagonist group. The increases in urinary salt and water excretion were also partially blocked by the antagonist. Microcatheterization studies showed significant partial reversal of ANF-induced inhibition of sodium chloride and water reabsorption in the medullary collecting duct. We conclude that the antagonist is an effective specific blocker of the cardiovascular, renal hemodynamic, and tubular effects of ANF, providing a useful new tool to elucidate the regulatory roles of this peptide hormone syste.
l guanylate cyclase mediates the action of the heat-stable enterotoxin to cause a decrease in intestinal fluid absorption and to increase chloride secretion, ultimately causing diarrhea. An endogenous ligand that acts on this guanylate cyclase has not previously been found. To search for a potential endogenous ligand, we utilized T84 cells, a human colon carcinoma-derived cell line, in culture as a bioassay. This cell line selectively responds to the toxin in a very sensitive manner with an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP. In the present study, we describe the purification and structure of a peptide from rat jejunum that activates this enzyme. This peptide, which we have termed guanylin, is composed of 15 amino acids and has the following amino acid sequence, PNTCEICAYAACTGC, as determined by automated Edman degradation sequence analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of this peptide reveals a high degree of homology with heat-stable enterotoxins. Solid-phase synthesis of this peptide confirmed that it stimulates increases in T84 cyclic GMP levels. Guanylin required oxidation for expression of bioactivity and subsequent reduction of the oxidized peptide eliminated the effect on cyclic GMP, indicating a requirement for cysteine disulfide bond formation. Synthetic guanylin also displaces heat-stable enterotoxin binding to cultured T84 cells. Based on these data, we propose that guanylin is an activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase and that it stimulates this enzyme through the same receptor binding region as the heat-stable enterotoxin.
crine activation of transepithelial chloride secretion by shark rectal gland cells is associated with increases in cellular cAMP, cGMP, and free calcium concentrations. We report here on the effects of several chloride secretagogues on inositol phosphate formation in cultured rectal gland tubules. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), atriopeptin (AP), and ionomycin increase the total inositol phosphate levels of cultured tubules, as measured by ion exchange chromatography. Forskolin, a potent chloride secretagogue, has no effect on inositol phosphate formation. The uptake of 3H-myo-inositol into phospholipids is very slow, preventing the detection of increased levels of inositol trisphosphate. However, significant increases in inositol monophosphate (IP1) and inositol biphosphate (IP2) were measured. The time course of VIP- and AP-stimulated IP1 and IP2 formation is similar to the effects of these agents on the short-circuit current responses of rectal gland monolayer cultures. In addition, aluminum fluoride, an artificial activator of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, stimulates IP1 and IP2 formation. We conclude that rectal gland cells contain VIP and AP receptors coupled to the activation of phospholipase C. Coupling may be mediated by G-proteins. Receptor-stimulated increases in inositol phospholipid metabolism is one mechanism leading to increased intracellular free calcium concentrations, an important regulatory event in the activation of transepithelial chloride secretion by shark rectal gland epithelial cell.
studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that Na-K-Cl cotransport of vascular smooth muscle cells is inhibited by hormones that increase intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels (e.g., catecholamines) and is stimulated by hormones that increase intracellular guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels (e.g., atrial natriuretic peptides). Others have suggested that calcium may also modulate Na-K-Cl cotransport of vascular smooth muscle cells. The goal of the present study was to characterize the mechanism of angiotensin II stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport of early passage cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. We found that when vascular smooth muscle cells were treated with angiotensin II or a calcium ionophore, Na-K-Cl cotransport was markedly enhanced above basal levels. We found that when calcium influx was blocked with the calcium chelator EDTA or with three different chemical types of calcium-channel blockers, the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II on Na-K-Cl cotransport were markedly inhibited. Furthermore, when intracellular calcium mobilization was blocked with high concentrations of the calcium chelator quin2 or with the intracellular calcium antagonist 8-(diethyl-amino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II on Na-K-Cl cotransport were also substantially inhibited. These results suggest that both calcium influx via receptor-operated calcium channels and intracellular calcium mobilization may play a role in stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport of vascular smooth muscle cells in response to angiotensin I.
ture of avian parathyroid hormone (PTH) is only partially known, therefore studies of the avian renal responses to PTH have been conducted using bovine parathyroid extract (bPTE), synthetic human PTH (h(1-34)PTH), and synthetic bovine PTH (b(1-34)PTH). In vitro studies indicate that these peptides may have quite different chick kidney receptor binding affinities and adenylate cyclase activation potencies. In the present study, the in vivo renal responses to bPTE, b(1-34)PTH, and h(1-34)PTH have been compared in immature domestic fowl. The following parameters were evaluated: glomerular filtration rates; renal plasma flow rates; urine pH; and fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphate. Overall, the different hormonal peptides elicited qualitatively similar responses: they all were phosphaturic, natriuretic, diuretic, hypomagnesiuric, hypocalciuric, and kaliuretic. This is the first study to show an effect of PTH on renal magnesium transport in avian species. Quantitative comparisons make it clear that bPTE is more natriuretic and diuretic, but less phosphaturic than either b(1-34)PTH or h(1-34)PTH. A temporal dissociation of the phosphaturic response from the other mineral and electrolyte responses suggests that the phosphaturic response is mediated by a separate mechanis.
 mice made deficient in growth arrest-specific gene 6 product (Gas6) or in which Gas6 gene expression was inhibited were shown to have platelet dysfunction and to be less susceptible to thrombosis. The aim of this study was to define and characterize the relevant Gas6 receptor or receptors involved in platelet functio.
PCR and Western blot analysis we found that mer was the predominantly expressed subtype in mouse and human platelets, whereas axl and rse were not detected. We generated mer-deficient mice by targeted disruption of the mer receptor gene. Platelets derived from mer-deficient mice had decreased platelet aggregation in responses to low concentrations of collagen, U46619, and PAR4 thrombin receptor agonist peptide in vitro. However, the response to ADP was not different from wild-type platelets. Knockout of the mer gene protected mice from collagen/epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromoembolism and inhibited ferric chloride-induced thrombosis in vivo. Tail bleeding times, coagulation parameters, and peripheral blood cell counts in mer-deficient mice were similar to wild-type mic.
provide the first evidence that mer, presumably through activation by its ligand Gas6, participates in regulation of platelet function in vitro and platelet-dependent thrombosis in viv.
(purine.pyrimidine) [poly(R.Y)] sequences in eukaryotic genomes are interrupted by one or more base pair inversions. When the inversions are centrally located, the poly(R.Y) sequences can be regarded as the sum of two abutting sites, each potentially capable of forming a triple helix. Employing band-shift, footprinting and modeling methods we examined the formation of triple helices at a critical 27 bp poly(R.Y) sequence interrupted by two adjacent CG inversions, and located in the promoter of the human bcr gene at transcription initiation. We designed several 13-mer and 14-mer triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) capable of binding the bcr abutting sites, thereby generating different base juxtapositions at the triple helical junction, to examine whether triplex formation occurs in a cooperative manner. It is found that in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermine, 37 degrees C, the 13-and the 14-mer TFOs bind to one half of the bcr site with Delta G between -30 and -35 kJ x mol-1. However, when different 13-mer/14-mer combinations of TFOs were directed against the abutting poly(R x Y) sites, triplex formation has been found to be enhanced only for the triple helical junction formed by the 5'-A-T-3' base juxtaposition, in keeping with a partial stacking suggested from modeling analysis. On the other hand, a longer 24-mer TFO, binding noncooperatively to the same abutting sites, forms a much more stable triplex (Delta G = -51 kJ x mol-1), notwithstanding the two T x CG triads in the middle. Modeling investigations reveal that there is no continuity or propagation of base stacking involving adjacent bases of the third strand at the site of base inversion as well as on the 5' side. The data indicate that the entropy penalty of forming a triplex with two oligonucleotides is much higher than the energy gained from base stacking interactions at the triplex junction formed between the two TFO.
ects invading viral RNA and activates the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF3 through the mitochondrial protein MAVS. Here we show that RNA bearing 5'-triphosphate strongly activates the RIG-I-IRF3 signaling cascade in a reconstituted system composed of RIG-I, mitochondria, and cytosol. Activation of RIG-I requires not only RNA but also polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63) of ubiquitin. RIG-I binds specifically to K63-polyubiquitin chains through its tandem CARD domains in a manner that depends on RNA and ATP. Mutations in the CARD domains that abrogate ubiquitin binding also impair RIG-I activation. Remarkably, unanchored K63-ubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, potently activate RIG-I. These ubiquitin chains function as an endogenous ligand of RIG-I in human cells. Our results delineate the mechanism of RIG-I activation, identify CARD domains as a ubiquitin sensor, and demonstrate that unanchored K63-polyubiquitin chains are signaling molecules in antiviral innate immunit.
tions of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) genes and gene-nutrient interactions with respect to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk are limited to candidate polymorphisms and dietary folate. This study comprehensively investigated associations between genetic variants in FOCM and CRC risk and whether the FOCM nutrient status modified these association.
ed eighty-eight candidate and tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 30 FOCM genes were genotyped for 821 incident CRC case-control matched pairs in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. FOCM biomarkers (red blood cell [RBC] folate, plasma folate, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate [PLP], vitamin B12, and homocysteine) and self-reported alcohol consumption were measured at the baseline. Conditional logistic regression was implemented; effect modification was examined on the basis of known enzyme-nutrient relation.
ally significant associations were observed between CRC risk and functionally defined candidate SNPs of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1; K134R), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR; P450R), and PR domain containing 2 with ZNF domain (PRDM2; S450N) and a literature candidate SNP of thymidylate synthase (TYMS; g.676789A&gt;T; nominal P &lt; .05). In addition, suggestive associations were noted for tagging SNPs in cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3β (DNMT3B), methionine adenosyltransferase I α (MAT1A), MTHFD1, and MTRR (nominal P &lt; .05; adjusted P, not significant). Significant interactions between nutrient biomarkers and candidate polymorphisms were observed for 1) plasma/RBC folate and folate hydrolase 1 (FOLH1), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), transcobalamin II (TCN2), DNMT1, and DNMT3B; 2) plasma PLP and TYMS TS3; 3) plasma B12 and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 2 (BHMT2); and 4) homocysteine and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and alanyl-transfer RNA synthetase (AARS.

nduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) differentiate into germ cells for potential disease modeling in vitr.
lines derived from POI patients with 46, X, del(X)(q26) or 46, X, del(X)(q26)9qh+ could differentiate into germ cells and expressed lower levels of genes in the deletion region of the X chromosom.
nology has been envisioned as an approach for generating patient-specific stem cells for disease modeling and for developing novel therapies. It has also been confirmed that iPSCs differentiate into germ cell.
ed the differentiation ability of germ cells and the gene expression level of germ cell-related genes in the X chromosome deletion region of iPSC lines derived from POI patients (n = 2) with an iPSC line derived from normal fibroblasts (n = 1.
ished three iPSC lines from two patients with partial Xq deletion-induced POI and normal fibroblasts by overexpressing four factors: octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), Nanog homeobox (NANOG), and lin-28 homolog (LIN28), using lentiviral vectors. We then generated stable-transfected fluorescent reporter cell lines under the control of the Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp box polypeptide 4 (DDX4, also called VASA) promoter, and selected clonal derived sublines. We induced subline differentiation into germ cells by adding Wnt3a (30 ng/ml) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (100 ng/ml). After 12 days of differentiation, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive and GFP-negative cells were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analyzed for endogenous VASA protein (immunostaining) and for germ cell markers and genes expressed in the deleted region of the X chromosome (quantitative RT-PCR.
and normal fibroblast-derived iPSCs had typical self-renewal and pluripotency characteristics. After stable transfection with the VASA-GFP construct, the sublines POI1-iPS-V.1, POI2-iPS-V.1 and hEF-iPS-V.1 produced green fluorescent cells in the differentiated cultures, and the percentage of GFP-positive cells increased over the 12 days of differentiation to a maximum of 6.9 ± 0.33%, 5.3 ± 0.57% and 8.5 ± 0.29%, respectively, of the total cell population. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that endogenous VASA was enriched in the GFP-positive cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed significantly higher expression of germ cell markers [PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain (PRDM1, BLIMP1), developmental pluripotency-associated 3 (DPPA3, STELLA), deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL), and VASA (DDX4)] in GFP-positive cells than in GFP-negative cells. Moreover, the GFP-positive cells from POI-iPSCs had reduced expression of the family with sequence similarity 122C (FAM122C), inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG), and RNA binding motif protein, X-linked (RBMX), genes located in the deleted region of the X chromosome and that are highly expressed in differentiated germ cells, compared with cells from normal iPSC.
ession profiling indicated that the germ cells differentiated from POI-iPSCs were pre-meiotic. Therefore, how the differentiated primordial germ cells could progress further to meiosis and form follicles remains to be determined in the study of PO.
ts might provide an in vitro model for studying germ cell development in patients with PO.

ing growth factor-β activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is a key regulatory molecule in toll-like receptor (TLR), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways. The activation of TAK1 is specifically regulated by two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2. However, the roles of TAB1 and TAB2 in fish have not been reported to date. In the present study, TAB1 (CiTAB1) and TAB2 (CiTAB2) in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) were identified and characterized, and their expression profiles were analyzed after fish were infected with the pathogenic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. The full-length CiTAB1 cDNA is 1949&nbsp;bp long with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1497&nbsp;bp that encodes a putative protein of 498 amino acids containing a typical PP2Cc domain. The full-length CiTAB2 cDNA is 2967&nbsp;bp long and contains an ORF of 2178&nbsp;bp encoding a putative protein of 725 amino acids. Protein structure analysis revealed that CiTAB2 consists of three main structural domains: an N-terminal CUE domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal ZnF domain. Multiple sequence alignment showed that CiTAB1 and CiTAB2 share high sequence identity with other known TAB1 and TAB2 proteins, and several conserved phosphorylation sites and an O-GlcNAc site were deduced in CiTAB1. Phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that CiTAB1 and CiTAB2 have the closest evolutionary relationship with TAB1 and TAB2 of Danio rerio, respectively. CiTAB1 and CiTAB2 were both widely expressed in all examined tissues with the highest levels in the heart and liver, respectively. After infection with I.&nbsp;multifiliis, the expressions of CiTAB1 and CiTAB2 were both significantly up-regulated in all tested tissues at most time points, which indicates that these proteins may be involved in the host immune response against I.&nbsp;multifiliis infectio.
orespiratory fitness is a powerful predictor of morbidity and cardiovascular mortality. In 473 sedentary adults, all whites, from 99 families of the Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training, and Genetics (HERITAGE) Family Study, the heritability of gains in maximal O(2) uptake (VO(2max)) after exposure to a standardized 20-wk exercise program was estimated at 47%. A genome-wide association study based on 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was undertaken to identify SNPs associated with improvements in VO(2max) Based on single-SNP analysis, 39 SNPs were associated with the gains with P &lt; 1.5 × 10(-4). Stepwise multiple regression analysis of the 39 SNPs identified a panel of 21 SNPs that accounted for 49% of the variance in VO(2max) trainability. Subjects who carried ≤9 favorable alleles at these 21 SNPs improved their VO(2max) by 221 ml/min, whereas those who carried ≥19 of these alleles gained, on average, 604 ml/min. The strongest association was with rs6552828, located in the acyl-CoA synthase long-chain member 1 (ACSL1) gene, which accounted by itself for ~6% of the training response of VO(2max). The genes nearest to the SNPs that were the strongest predictors were PR domain-containing 1 with ZNF domain (PRDM1); glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl-D-aspartate 3A (GRIN3A); K(+) channel, voltage gated, subfamily H, member 8 (KCNH8); and zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 4 (ZIC4). The association with the SNP nearest to ZIC4 was replicated in 40- to 65-yr-old, sedentary, overweight, and dyslipidemic subjects trained in Studies of a Targeted Risk Reduction Intervention Through Defined Exercise (STRRIDE; n = 183). Two SNPs were replicated in sedentary obese white women exercise trained in the Dose Response to Exercise (DREW) study (n = 112): rs1956197 near dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1) and rs17117533 in the vicinity of necdin (NDN). The association of SNPs rs884736 in the calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) locus and rs17581162 ~68 kb upstream from regulator of G protein signaling 18 (RGS18) with the gains in VO(2max) in HERITAGE whites were replicated in HERITAGE blacks (n = 247). These genomic predictors of the response of Vo(2max) to regular exercise provide new targets for the study of the biology of fitness and its adaptation to regular exercise. Large-scale replication studies are warrante.
rtebrate development the dorsal gastrula or Spemann-Mangold organizer orchestrates axis formation largely by limiting the ventralizing and posteriorizing activity of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In mouse and Xenopus laevis, genes encoding the zinc finger transcriptional repressor Prdm1/Blimp1 (PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain; previously named B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1) were recently shown to be expressed in the visceral endoderm and anterior endomesoderm, respectively, and the prechordal plate of gastrula stage embryos. Later in development Prdm1/Blimp1 is expressed in many other tissues, including pharyngeal arches, limb buds, otic vesicles, photoreceptor cell layer, slow muscle and cloaca. Based on misexpression and dominant-negative studies, Prdm1/Blimp1 was proposed to promote anterior endomesoderm and head development in Xenopus laevis. Here we report the isolation and functional characterization of zebrafish prdm1 exhibiting a dynamic and evolutionarily conserved expression pattern. Misexpression of prdm1 inhibits the formation of dorsoanterior structures and reduces expression of chordin, which encodes a BMP antagonist. Conversely, interference with Prdm1 translation using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, increases chordin expression, while reducing expression of Bmp genes, and consequently dorsalizing the embryo. At the end of the gastrula period, prdm1 morphant embryos have enlarged animal-vegetal and anteroposterior embryonic axes. This altered embryo morphology is associated with augmented extension movements of dorsal tissues and normal posterior migration of ventral tissues. Additionally, Prdm1 activity is essential for proper development of slow muscle, the photoreceptor cell layer, branchial arches and pectoral fins. Our studies reveal essential roles for prdm1 in limiting the function of the gastrula organizer and regulating cell fate specification and morphogenetic processes in precise correspondence with its intricate expression patter.
de association studies (GWAS) on sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) are mainly conducted in European and American populations at present, and the Han populations of Chinese mainland (HPCM) almost have not been studied yet. Here, we conducted a pooling GWAS combining a pathway analysis with 862,198 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms of IlluminaHumanOmniZhongHua-8 in 250 sPD and 250 controls from HPCM precluded toxicant exposure, age, and heavy coffee drinking habit interference. We revealed that among the 22 potential loci implicated, PRDM2/KIAA1026 (kgp8090149), TSG1/MANEA (kgp154172), PDE10A (kgp8130520), MDGA2 (rs9323124), ATPBD4/LOC100288892 (kgp11333367), ZFP64/TSHZ2 (kgp4156164), PAQR3/ARD1B (kgp9482779), FLJ23172/FNDC3B (kgp760898), C18orf1 (kgp348599), FLJ43860/NCRNA00051 (kgp4105983), CYP1B1/C2orf58 (kgp11353523), WNT9A/LOC728728 (rs849898), ANXA1/LOC100130911 (rs10746953), FLJ35379/LOC100132423 (kgp9550589), PLEKHN1 (kgp7172368), DMRT2/SMARCA2 (kgp10769919), ZNF396/INO80C (rs1362858), C3orf67/LOC339902 (rs6783485), LOC285194/IGSF11 (rs1879553), FGF10/MRPS30 (rs13153459), BARX1/PTPDC1 (kgp6542803), and COL5 A2 (rs11186), the peak significance was at the kgp4105983 of FLJ43860 gene in chromosome 8, the first top strongest associated locus with sPD was PRDM2 (kgp8090149) in chromosome 1, and the 24 pathways including 100 significantly associated genes were strongly associated with sPD from HPCM. The 40 genes were shared by at least two pathways. The most possible associated pathways with sPD were axon guidance, ECM-receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, tight junction, focal adhesion, gap junction, long-term depression, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, adherens junction, endocytosis, and protein digestion and absorption. Our results indicated that these loci, pathways, and their related genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of sPD from HPCM and provided some novel evidences for further searching the genetic pathogenesis of sP.
m cell quiescence is critical to ensure regeneration while minimizing tumorigenesis. Epigenetic regulation contributes to cell cycle control and differentiation, but few regulators of the chromatin state in quiescent cells are known. Here we report that the tumor suppressor PRDM2/RIZ, an H3K9 methyltransferase, is enriched in quiescent muscle stem cells in vivo and controls reversible quiescence in cultured myoblasts. We find that PRDM2 associates with &gt;4400 promoters in G0 myoblasts, 55% of which are also marked with H3K9me2 and enriched for myogenic, cell cycle and developmental regulators. Knockdown of PRDM2 alters histone methylation at key promoters such as Myogenin and CyclinA2 (CCNA2), and subverts the quiescence program via global de-repression of myogenesis, and hyper-repression of the cell cycle. Further, PRDM2 acts upstream of the repressive PRC2 complex in G0. We identify a novel G0-specific bivalent chromatin domain in the CCNA2 locus. PRDM2 protein interacts with the PRC2 protein EZH2 and regulates its association with the bivalent domain in the CCNA2 gene. Our results suggest that induction of PRDM2 in G0 ensures that two antagonistic programs-myogenesis and the cell cycle-while stalled, are poised for reactivation. Together, these results indicate that epigenetic regulation by PRDM2 preserves key functions of the quiescent state, with implications for stem cell self-renewa.
agonists (DAs) are the first-line treatment for prolactinomas, which account for 25-30% of functioning pituitary adenomas, and bromocriptine (BRC) is the only commercially available DAs in China. However, tumors are resistant to therapy in 5-18% of patient.
s of six responsive prolactinomas and six resistant prolactinomas were analyzed by whole-exome sequencin.
ingent variant calling and filtering parameters, ten somatic variants that were mainly associated with DNA repair or protein metabolic processes were identified. New resistant variants were identified in multiple genes including PRDM2, PRG4, MUC4, DSPP, DPCR1, RP1L1, MX2, POTEF, C1orf170, and KRTAP10-3. The expression of these genes was then quantified by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) in 12 prolactinomas and 3 normal pituitary glands. The mRNA levels of PRDM2 were approximately five-fold lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors (p &lt; 0.05). PRDM2 protein levels were lower in resistant prolactinomas than in responsive tumors, as determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis (p &lt; 0.05). Overexpression of PRDM2 upregulated dopamine receptor D2 (D2DR) and inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MMQ cells. PRDM2 showed a synergistic effect with BRC on the inhibition of prolactin (PRL) secretion and MMQ cell viability, and low PRDM2 expression was associated with tumor recurrenc.
nregulation may play a role in dopamine-agonist resistance and tumor recurrence in prolactinoma.
erentiation is controlled by specific transcription factors. The functions and expression levels of these transcription factors are regulated by epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications and cytosine methylation of the genome. In tendon tissue, tendon-specific transcription factors have been shown to play functional roles in the regulation of tenocyte differentiation. However, the effects of epigenetic modifications on gene expression and differentiation in tenocytes are unclear. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic regulation of tenocyte differentiation, focusing on the enzymes mediating histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation. In primary mouse tenocytes, six H3K9 methyltransferase (H3K9MTase) genes, i.e., G9a, G9a-like protein (GLP), PR domain zinc finger protein 2 (PRDM2), SUV39H1, SUV39H2, and SETDB1/ESET were all expressed, with increased mRNA levels observed during tenocyte differentiation. In mouse embryos, G9a and Prdm2 mRNAs were expressed in tenocyte precursor cells, which were overlapped with or were adjacent to cells expressing a tenocyte-specific marker, tenomodulin. Using tenocytes isolated from G9a-flox/flox mice, we deleted G9a by infecting the cells with Cre-expressing adenoviruses. Proliferation of G9a-null tenocytes was significantly decreased compared with that of control cells infected with GFP-expressing adenoviruses. Moreover, the expression levels of tendon transcription factors gene, i.e., Scleraxis (Scx), Mohawk (Mkx), Egr1, Six1, and Six2 were all suppressed in G9a-null tenocytes. The tendon-related genes Col1a1, tenomodulin, and periostin were also downregulated. Consistent with this, Western blot analysis showed that tenomodulin protein expression was significantly suppressed by G9a deletion. These results suggested that expression of the H3K9MTase G9a was essential for the differentiation and growth of tenocytes and that H3K9MTases may play important roles in tendinogenesi.
noblastoma protein-interacting zinc finger protein), also denoted PRDM2, is a transcriptional regulator and tumor suppressor. It was initially identified because of its ability to interact with another well-established tumor suppressor, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). A short motif, IRCDE, in the acidic region (AR) of RIZ was reported to play an important role in the interaction with the pocket domain of Rb. The IRCDE motif is similar to a consensus Rb-binding sequence LXCXE (where X denotes any amino acid) that is found in several viral Rb-inactivating oncoproteins. To improve our understanding of the molecular basis of binding of Rb to RIZ, we investigated the interaction between purified recombinant AR and the pocket domain of Rb using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and fluorescence anisotropy experiments. We show that AR is intrinsically disordered and that it binds the pocket domain with submicromolar affinity. We also demonstrate that the interaction between AR and the pocket domain is mediated primarily by the short stretch of residues containing the IRCDE motif and that the contribution of other parts of AR to the interaction with the pocket domain is minimal. Overall, our data provide clear evidence that RIZ is one of the few cellular proteins that can interact directly with the LXCXE-binding cleft on R.
ltransferase 1 (DNMT1), a key enzyme mediating DNA methylation, is known to be elevated in various cancers, including the mouse lung tumors induced by the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). However, it is not known whether DNMT1 expression is induced right after NNK treatment and how DNMT1 expression varies throughout lung tumorigenesis. In the present study, we found that administration of NNK to A/J mice caused elevation of DNMT1 in bronchial epithelial cells at Days 1, 3, and 14 after NNK treatment. DNMT1 elevation at Day 1 was accompanied by an increase in phospho-histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) and phospho-AKT (p-AKT). At Weeks 5 to 20, NNK-induced DNMT1 in lung tissues was in lower levels than the early stages, but was highly elevated in lung tumors at Week 20. In addition, the early induction of p-AKT and γ-H2AX as well as cleaved caspase-3 in NNK-treated lung tissues was not detected at Weeks 5 to 20 but was elevated in lung tumors. In concordance with DNMT1 elevation, promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes Cdh13, Prdm2, and Runx3 was observed in lung tissues at Day 3 and in lung tumors. Treatment by EGCG attenuated DNMT1, p-AKT, and γ-H2AX inductions at Days 1 and 3 and inhibited lung tumorigenesi.
ecific gene expression is subjected to epigenetic and genetic regulation. Posttranslational modifications of histone tails alter the accessibility of nuclear proteins to DNA, thus affecting the activity of the regulatory complex of nuclear proteins. Methylation at histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is a crucial modification that affects gene expression and cell differentiation. H3K9 is known to have 0-3 methylation states, and these four methylated states are determined by the expression of sets of histone methyltransferases. During development, teeth are formed through mutual interactions between the mesenchyme and epithelium via a process that is subjected to the epigenetic regulation. In this study, we examined the expression of all H3K9 methyltransferases (H3K9MTases) during mouse tooth development. We found that four H3K9MTases-G9a, Glp, Prdm2, and Suv39h1-were highly expressed in the tooth germ, with expression peaks at around embryonic days 16.5 and 17.5 in mice. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that all four H3K9MTases were enriched in the mesenchyme more than in the epithelium. Substrates of H3K9MTases, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 were also enriched in the mesenchyme. Taken together, these data suggested that coordinated expression of four H3K9MTases in the dental mesenchyme might play important roles in tooth developmen.
 is an oncogenic miRNA cluster implicated in the development of several cancers; however, it remains unknown whether the miR-17-92 cluster is able to regulate cholangiocarcinogenesis. This study was designed to investigate the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of the miR-17-92 cluster in cholangiocarcinoma. In situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the miR-17-92 cluster is highly expressed in human cholangiocarcinoma cells compared with the nonneoplastic biliary epithelial cells. Forced overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster or its members, miR-92a and miR-19a, in cultured human cholangiocarcinoma cells enhanced tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasiveness, in&nbsp;vitro. Overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster or miR-92a also enhanced cholangiocarcinoma growth in&nbsp;vivo in hairless outbred mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SHO-Prkdc(scid)Hr(hr)). The tumor-suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), was identified as a bona fide target of both miR-92a and miR-19a in cholangiocarcinoma cells via sequence prediction, 3' untranslated region luciferase activity assay, and Western blot analysis. Accordingly, overexpression of the PTEN open reading frame protein (devoid of 3' untranslated region) prevented miR-92a- or miR-19a-induced cholangiocarcinoma cell growth. Microarray analysis revealed additional targets of the miR-17-92 cluster in human cholangiocarcinoma cells, including APAF-1 and PRDM2. Moreover, we observed that the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster is regulated by IL-6/Stat3, a key oncogenic signaling pathway pivotal in cholangiocarcinogenesis. Taken together, our findings disclose a novel IL-6/Stat3-miR-17-92 cluster-PTEN signaling axis that is crucial for cholangiocarcinogenesis and tumor progressio.
l-l-methionine (SAM) is recognized as an important cofactor in a variety of biochemical reactions. As more proteins and pathways that require SAM are discovered, it is important to establish a method to quickly identify and characterize SAM binding proteins. The affinity of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) for SAM binding proteins was used to design two SAH-derived capture compounds (CCs). We demonstrate interactions of the proteins COMT and SAHH with SAH-CC with biotin used in conjunction with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. After demonstrating SAH-dependent photo-crosslinking of the CC to these proteins, we used a CC labeled with a fluorescein tag to measure binding affinity via fluorescence anisotropy. We then used this approach to show and characterize binding of SAM to the PR domain of PRDM2, a lysine methyltransferase with putative tumor suppressor activity. We calculated the Kd values for COMT, SAHH, and PRDM2 (24.1 ± 2.2 μM, 6.0 ± 2.9 μM, and 10.06 ± 2.87 μM, respectively) and found them to be close to previously established Kd values of other SAM binding proteins. Here, we present new methods to discover and characterize SAM and SAH binding proteins using fluorescent CC.
te DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair factor choice is essential for ensuring accurate repair outcome and genomic integrity. The factors that regulate this process remain poorly understood. Here, we identify two repressive chromatin components, the macrohistone variant macroH2A1 and the H3K9 methyltransferase and tumor suppressor PRDM2, which together direct the choice between the antagonistic DSB repair mediators BRCA1 and 53BP1. The macroH2A1/PRDM2 module mediates an unexpected shift from accessible to condensed chromatin that requires the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent accumulation of both proteins at DSBs in order to promote DSB-flanking H3K9 dimethylation. Remarkably, loss of macroH2A1 or PRDM2, as well as experimentally induced chromatin decondensation, impairs the retention of BRCA1, but not 53BP1, at DSBs. As a result, macroH2A1 and/or PRDM2 depletion causes epistatic defects in DSB end resection, homology-directed repair, and the resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition-all hallmarks of BRCA1-deficient tumors. Together, these findings identify dynamic, DSB-associated chromatin reorganization as a critical modulator of BRCA1-dependent genome maintenanc.
igate the changes of expression and methylation status of PRDM2, PRDM5, PRDM16 in lung cancer cells after treatment with demethylation agen.
g adenocarcinoma cell line), HTB-182 (lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line) and HBE (normal bronchial cell line) were treated with 5-aza-2dC. The methylation state of PRDM2, PRDM5, PRDM16 was detected by MSP. The expression of PRDM2, PRDM5, PRDM16 was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell growth was detected by MTT assa.
C reduced the methylation of PRDM2, PRDM5, PRDM16 gene in A549 and HTB-182 cells but not in HBE cells. Consistently, 5-aza-2dC increased mRNA and protein expression of PRDM2, PRDM5, PRDM16 in A549 and HTB-182 cells but not in HBE cells. Furthermore, 5-aza-2dC inhibited the growth of A549 and HTB-182 cells but not HBE cell.
DM5, PRDM16 promoters are methylated and their expression is suppressed in lung cancer cells. Demethylation drug 5-aza-2dC could upregulate the expression of PRDM2, PRDM5, PRDM16 and suppress lung cancer cell growth. 5-aza-2dC has potential to be used for lung cancer therapy by epigenetic mechanis.
orectal cancer cell lines are used widely to investigate tumor biology, experimental therapy, and biomarkers. However, to what extent these established cell lines represent and maintain the genetic diversity of primary cancers is uncertain. In this study, we profiled 70 colorectal cancer cell lines for mutations and DNA copy number by whole-exome sequencing and SNP microarray analyses, respectively. Gene expression was defined using RNA-Seq. Cell line data were compared with those published for primary colorectal cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Notably, we found that exome mutation and DNA copy-number spectra in colorectal cancer cell lines closely resembled those seen in primary colorectal tumors. Similarities included the presence of two hypermutation phenotypes, as defined by signatures for defective DNA mismatch repair and DNA polymerase ε proofreading deficiency, along with concordant mutation profiles in the broadly altered WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGFβ, and p53 pathways. Furthermore, we documented mutations enriched in genes involved in chromatin remodeling (ARID1A, CHD6, and SRCAP) and histone methylation or acetylation (ASH1L, EP300, EP400, MLL2, MLL3, PRDM2, and TRRAP). Chromosomal instability was prevalent in nonhypermutated cases, with similar patterns of chromosomal gains and losses. Although paired cell lines derived from the same tumor exhibited considerable mutation and DNA copy-number differences, in silico simulations suggest that these differences mainly reflected a preexisting heterogeneity in the tumor cells. In conclusion, our results establish that human colorectal cancer lines are representative of the main subtypes of primary tumors at the genomic level, further validating their utility as tools to investigate colorectal cancer biology and drug response.
 small calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100 protein family, is commonly overexpressed in a variety of tumor types and is widely accepted to associate with metastasis by regulating the motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. However, its biological role in lung carcinogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we found that S100A4 was frequently overexpressed in lung cancer cells, irrespective of histological subtype. Then we performed knockdown and forced expression of S100A4 in lung cancer cell lines and found that specific knockdown of S100A4 effectively suppressed cell proliferation only in lung cancer cells with S100A4-overexpression; forced expression of S100A4 accelerated cell motility only in S100A4 low-expressing lung cancer cells. PRDM2 and VASH1, identified as novel upregulated genes by microarray after specific knockdown of S100A4 in pancreatic cancer, were also analyzed, and we found that PRDM2 was significantly upregulated after S100A4-knockdown in one of two analyzed S100A4-overexpressing lung cancer cells. Our present results suggest that S100A4 plays an important role in lung carcinogenesis by means of cell proliferation and motility by a pathway similar to that in pancreatic cance.
nce of furan in common cooked foods along with evidence from experimental studies that lifetime exposure to furan causes liver tumors in rats and mice has caused concern to regulatory public health agencies worldwide; however, the mechanisms of the furan-induced hepatocarcinogenicity remain unclear. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether or not long-term exposure to furan causes epigenetic alterations in rat liver. Treating of male Fisher 344 rats by gavage 5 days per week with 0, 0.92, 2.0, or 4.4 mg furan/kg body weight (bw)/day resulted in dose- and time-dependent epigenetic changes consisting of alterations in DNA methylation and histone lysine methylation and acetylation, altered expression of chromatin modifying genes, and gene-specific methylation. Specifically, exposure to furan at doses 0.92, 2.0, or 4.4 mg furan/kg bw/day caused global DNA demethylation after 360 days of treatment. There was also a sustained decrease in the levels of histone H3 lysine 9 and H4 lysine 20 trimethylation after 180 and 360 days of furan exposure, and a marked reduction of histone H3 lysine 9 and H3 lysine 56 acetylation after 360 days at 4.4 mg/kg bw/day. These histone modification changes were accompanied by a reduced expression of Suv39h1, Prdm2, and Suv4-20h2 histone methyltransferases and Ep300 and Kat2a histone acetyltransferases. Additionally, furan at 2.0 and 4.4 mg/kg bw/day induced hypermethylation-dependent down-regulation of the Rassf1a gene in the livers after 180 and 360 days. These findings indicate possible involvement of dose- and time-dependent epigenetic modifications in the furan hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicit.
lation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) represents a frequent and early epigenetic event with potential applications for cancer detection and disease evolution. Our aim was to examine the stratification and prognostic biomarker role of the methylation of a novel panel of TSGs in bladder cancer. The methylation status of 18 TSGs was evaluated in bladder cancer cells (n=14) and paraffin-embedded primary bladder tumors (n=61), using a methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay (MS-MLPA). Recurrence, progression, and disease-specific survival were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox models. PRDM2, HLTF, ID4, DLC1, BNIP3, H2AFX, CACNA1G, TGIF, and CACNA1A were discovered methylated in bladder cancer. The methylation of RUNX3 (p=0.026), TWIST1 (p=0.009), SFRP4 (p=0.002), and CCND2 (p=0.027) correlated to tumor stage. Univariate analyses indicated prognostic associations for recurrence (DLC1, SFRP5, H2AFX, CACNA1G), progression (DLC1, SFRP5, CACNA1G), disease-specific (PRDM2, DLC1, SFRP5, CACNA1G, and TIMP3), and overall survival (SFRP5 and TIMP3). In multivariate analyses, several TSGs remained as independent prognosticators for recurrence (SFRP5, H2AFX), progression (CACNA1G), and disease-specific survival (SFRP5). Thus, a novel set of TSGs was identified, frequently methylated in bladder cancer cells and tumors. TSG methylation allowed histopathologic and outcome stratification using paraffin-embedded tumors. This is clinically relevant by offering a strategy for the management of patients affected with uroepithelial neoplasias in pathology routine laboratorie.
loid leukemia with t(6;9)(p22;q34) is listed as a distinct entity in the 2008 World Health Organization classification, but little is known about the clinical implications of t(6;9)-positive myeloid leukemia in children. This international multicenter study presents the clinical and genetic characteristics of 62 pediatric patients with t(6;9)/DEK-NUP214-rearranged myeloid leukemia; 54 diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukemia, representing &lt;1% of all childhood acute myeloid leukemia, and eight as having myelodysplastic syndrome. The t(6;9)/DEK-NUP214 was associated with relatively late onset (median age 10.4 years), male predominance (sex ratio 1.7), French-American-British M2 classification (54%), myelodysplasia (100%), and FLT3-ITD (42%). Outcome was substantially better than previously reported with a 5-year event-free survival of 32%, 5-year overall survival of 53%, and a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 57%. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission improved the 5-year event-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone (68% versus 18%; P&lt;0.01) but not the overall survival (68% versus 54%; P=0.48). The presence of FLT3-ITD had a non-significant negative effect on 5-year overall survival compared with non-mutated cases (22% versus 62%; P=0.13). Gene expression profiling showed a unique signature characterized by significantly higher expression of EYA3, SESN1, PRDM2/RIZ, and HIST2H4 genes. In conclusion, t(6;9)/DEK-NUP214 represents a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with a high risk of relapse, high frequency of FLT3-ITD, and a specific gene expression signatur.
et8/KMT5a is the sole histone H4 lysine 20 monomethyltransferase (H4K20me1) in metazoans and is essential for proper cell division and genomic stability. We unexpectedly discovered that normal cellular levels of monomethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1) were also dependent on PR-Set7, but independent of its catalytic activity. This observation suggested that PR-Set7 interacts with an H3K9 monomethyltransferase to establish the previously reported H4K20me1-H3K9me1 trans-tail 'histone code'. Here we show that PR-Set7 specifically and directly binds the C-terminus of the Riz1/PRDM2/KMT8 tumor suppressor and demonstrate that the N-terminal PR/SET domain of Riz1 preferentially monomethylates H3K9. The PR-Set7 binding domain was required for Riz1 nuclear localization and maintenance of the H4K20me1-H3K9me1 trans-tail 'histone code'. Although Riz1 can function as a repressor, Riz1/H3K9me1 was dispensable for the repression of genes regulated by PR-Set7/H4K20me1. Frameshift mutations resulting in a truncated Riz1 incapable of binding PR-Set7 occur frequently in various aggressive cancers. In these cancer cells, expression of wild-type Riz1 restored tumor suppression by decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis. These phenotypes were not observed in cells expressing either the Riz1 PR/SET domain or PR-Set7 binding domain indicating that Riz1 methyltransferase activity and PR-Set7 binding domain are both essential for Riz1 tumor suppressor functio.
ic basis for Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) remains to be clarified. Although 6q losses are commonly present, recurring gene losses in this region remain to be defined. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 30 WM patients, which included germline/tumor sequencing for 10 patients. Validated somatic mutations occurring in &gt;10% of patients included MYD88, CXCR4, and ARID1A that were present in 90%, 27%, and 17% of patients, respectively, and included the activating mutation L265P in MYD88 and warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infection, and myelokathexis-syndrome-like mutations in CXCR4 that previously have only been described in the germline. WGS also delineated copy number alterations (CNAs) and structural variants in the 10 paired patients. The CXCR4 and CNA findings were validated in independent expansion cohorts of 147 and 30 WM patients, respectively. Validated gene losses due to CNAs involved PRDM2 (93%), BTG1 (87%), HIVEP2 (77%), MKLN1 (77%), PLEKHG1 (70%), LYN (60%), ARID1B (50%), and FOXP1 (37%). Losses in PLEKHG1, HIVEP2, ARID1B, and BCLAF1 constituted the most common deletions within chromosome 6. Although no recurrent translocations were observed, in 2 patients deletions in 6q corresponded with translocation events. These studies evidence highly recurring somatic events, and provide a genomic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of W.
en recently proposed by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis that the CCDC62 variant rs12817488 is a new risk locus associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between rs12817488 and PD in a Chinese cohort. A total of 341 PD patients and 423 matched controls were recruited in Eastern China. Our results showed that the A allele of rs12817488 was significantly associated with an aggravated risk of PD (p = 0.006) and represented a major allele in contrast to a minor one in Caucasians. Genotype distributions also differed between PD patients and controls (p = 0.011 for AA/AG/GG). Further analysis showed that the association of rs12817488 with PD only existed in females. We also investigated the protein level of CCDC62 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 41 AA or GG carriers and found an apparently higher expression in PD patients carrying the AA genotype. A potential interaction was found between two estrogen-related loci, i.e. rs12817488/CCDC62 and rs2697962/PRDM2, particularly in the female stratum. In conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time a significant association between the rs12817488 polymorphism and PD predisposition in a Chinese population with gender variations and provides new insight regarding the variant's protein expression and estrogen-related genetic interactio.
lation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP1) results in release of eIF4E, which sequentially relieves translational repression and enhances oncogenic protein synthesis. We assessed the expression of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1) in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and its correlation with clinicopathological factors and patient survival. This study included 117 SCLCs, which comprised 108 primary and 9 metastatic tumor tissues. We performed immunohistochemical staining for p-4E-BP1 in 117 tumors and found that 77 (66&nbsp;%) were positive for p-4E-BP1 with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear immunostaining. The positive rate of p-4E-BP1 staining was significantly higher in never smokers (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.034) and metastatic tumor tissues (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.027). Patients with p-4E-BP1-positive SCLC tended to have poor performance status, although the difference was not statistically significant (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.087). High p-4E-BP1 expression was significantly correlated with worse overall survival (OS) in all cohorts (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.016). After stratification by clinical stage, p-4E-BP1 expression showed a stronger relationship with OS in patients with limited disease (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.008). In addition, when stratified by treatment status, p-4E-BP1 expression was still significantly associated with worse OS in a subgroup of patients who completed treatment (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.021). Our results indicate that p-4E-BP1 expression could represent oncogenic potential and contribute to the progression and aggressiveness of SCLC, suggesting it could be a candidate prognostic biomarker of SCLC, especially in limited diseas.
lls can use strategies that make them resistant to nutrient deprivation to outcompete their neighbours. A key integrator of the cell's responses to starvation and other stresses is amino-acid-dependent mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Activation of mTORC1 on late endosomes and lysosomes is facilitated by amino-acid transporters within the solute-linked carrier 36 (SLC36) and SLC38 families. Here, we analyse the functions of SLC36 family member, SLC36A4, otherwise known as proton-assisted amino-acid transporter 4 (PAT4), in colorectal cancer. We show that independent of other major pathological factors, high PAT4 expression is associated with reduced relapse-free survival after colorectal cancer surgery. Consistent with this, PAT4 promotes HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell proliferation in culture and tumour growth in xenograft models. Inducible knockdown in HCT116 cells reveals that PAT4 regulates a form of mTORC1 with two distinct properties: first, it preferentially targets eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and second, it is resistant to rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, in HCT116 cells two non-essential amino acids, glutamine and serine, which are often rapidly metabolised by tumour cells, regulate rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 in a PAT4-dependent manner. Overexpressed PAT4 is also able to promote rapamycin resistance in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. PAT4 is predominantly associated with the Golgi apparatus in a range of cell types, and in situ proximity ligation analysis shows that PAT4 interacts with both mTORC1 and its regulator Rab1A on the Golgi. These findings, together with other studies, suggest that differentially localised intracellular amino-acid transporters contribute to the activation of alternate forms of mTORC1. Furthermore, our data predict that colorectal cancer cells with high PAT4 expression will be more resistant to depletion of serine and glutamine, allowing them to survive and outgrow neighbouring normal and tumorigenic cells, and potentially providing a new route for pharmacological intervention.Oncogene advance online publication, 5 October 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.36.
 target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase that acts downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway and regulates a wide range of cellular functions including transcription, translation, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Whereas genetic alterations that result in mTOR activation are frequently present in human cancers, whether the mTOR gene itself becomes an oncogene through somatic mutation has remained unclear. We have now identified a somatic nonsynonymous mutation of mTOR that results in a leucine-to-valine substitution at amino acid position 2209 in a specimen of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The mTOR(L2209V) mutant manifested marked transforming potential in a focus formation assay with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, and it induced the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, S6 ribosomal protein, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 in these cells. Examination of additional tumor specimens as well as of public and in-house databases of cancer genome mutations identified another 28 independent nonsynonymous mutations of mTOR in various cancer types, with 12 of these mutations also exhibiting transforming ability. Most of these oncogenic mutations cluster at the interface between the kinase domain and the FAT (FRAP, ATM, TRRAP) domain in the three-dimensional structure of mTOR. Transforming mTOR mutants were also found to promote 3T3 cell survival, and their oncogenic activity was sensitive to rapamycin. Our data thus show that mTOR acquires transforming activity through genetic changes in cancer, and they suggest that such tumors may be candidates for molecularly targeted therapy with mTOR inhibitors.

 protein-protein interacting sites for potential therapeutic applications is a challenge in the development of inhibitors, and this becomes more difficult when these interfaces are relatively planar, as in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein. eIF4E is an oncogene that is overexpressed in numerous forms of cancer, making it a prime target as a therapeutic molecule. We report here the presence of a cryptic pocket at the protein-binding interface of eIF4E, which opens transiently during molecular dynamics simulations of the protein in solvent water and is observed to be stable when solvent water is mixed with benzene molecules. This pocket can also be seen in the ensemble of structures available from the solution-state conformations of eIF4E. The accessibility of the pocket is gated by the side-chain transitions of an evolutionarily conserved tryptophan residue. It is found to be feasible for accommodating clusters of benzene molecules, which signify the plasticity and ligandability of the pocket. We also observe that the newly formed cavity provides a favorable binding environment for interaction of a well-recognized small molecule inhibitor of eIF4E. The occurrence of this transiently accessible cavity highlights the existence of a more pronounced binding groove in a region that has traditionally been considered to be planar. Together, the data suggest that an alternate binding cavity exists on eIF4E and could be exploited for the rational design and development of a new class of lead compounds against the protei.
ural killer T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) is a highly malignant tumor that is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Latent membrane protein&nbsp;1 (LMP1) is encoded by EBV and plays an important role in EBV-induced cell transformation. Therefore, we assessed the function of LMP1 as a stimulant of NKTL progression and the underlying mechanism. A human EBV-positive NKTL cell line (SNK-6) was transfected with pcDNA3.1-LMP1, LV-LMP1 shRNA or LV-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-shRNA. Then, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to assess the proliferation of SNK-6 cells, and cell migration and invasion were analyzed by transwell chamber assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis. The results showed LMP1 was highly expressed in SNK-6 cells compared with control groups. Following pretreatment with LMP1 shRNA, the proliferation of SNK-6 cells was inhibited and resulted in a G0/G1 phase arrest. A reduction in invasion and migration was also observed. LMP1 silencing promoted cell apoptosis. Further mechanistic analysis suggested that LMP1 overexpression induced the expression of eIF4E, while eIF4E-shRNA dramatically attenuated the increase in cell proliferation, invasion, migration and the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by LMP-1 upregulation. Moreover, the effect of LMP1 on eIF4E expression was mediated by the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, this finding may provide a potential target against NKT.
c translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is overexpressed in cervical cancer (CC). However, the molecular mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of eIF4E gene overexpression in C.
 papillomavirus (HPV) type 18 E7 and eIF4E mRNAs were measured following knock down or overexpression of E7 gene by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Cell counting kit-8 assay was used to determine the cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis. Transwell system was employed to determine the cell migratio.
ssion of E7 gene increased eIF4E mRNA level by 24.3% (P&lt;0.01) in HPV negative C33A cells. Knock down of E7 decreased markedly eIF4E mRNA by 73% (P&lt;0.01) in HPV18 positive HeLa cells. Under the state of high expression of E7, 1) up-regulation of eIF4E drastically promoted the cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell migration, and inhibited the cell apoptosis. 2) down-regulation of eIF4E significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, cell cycle and the ability of cell migration, and also promoted the apoptosis of cervical cancer cell.
duced eIF4E gene over transcription which might be a new marker for CC. The finding broadens the understanding of the CC carcinogenesi.
yotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) recognizes the mRNA cap structure and, together with eIF4G and eIF4A, form the eIF4F complex that regulates translation initiation in eukaryotes. In trypanosomatids, two eIF4E homologues (EIF4E3 and EIF4E4) have been shown to be part of eIF4F-like complexes with presumed roles in translation initiation. Both proteins possess unique N-terminal extensions, which can be targeted for phosphorylation. Here, we provide novel insights on the Leishmania infantum EIF4E4 function and regulation. We show that EIF4E4 is constitutively expressed throughout the parasite development but is preferentially phosphorylated in exponentially grown promastigote and amastigote life stages, hence correlating with high levels of translation. Phosphorylation targets multiple serine-proline or threonine-proline residues within the N-terminal extension of EIF4E4 but does not require binding to the EIF4E4's partner, EIF4G3, or to the cap structure. We also report that EIF4E4 interacts with PABP1 through three conserved boxes at the EIF4E4&nbsp;N-terminus and that this interaction is a prerequisite for efficient EIF4E4 phosphorylation. EIF4E4 is essential for Leishmania growth and an EIF4E4 null mutant was only obtained in the presence of an ectopically provided wild type gene. Complementation for the loss of EIF4E4 with several EIF4E4 mutant proteins affecting either phosphorylation or binding to mRNA or to EIF4E4 protein partners revealed that, in contrast to other eukaryotes, only the EIF4E4-PABP1 interaction but neither the binding to EIF4G3 nor phosphorylation is essential for translation. These studies also demonstrated that the lack of both EIF4E4 phosphorylation and EIF4G3 binding leads to a non-functional protein. Altogether, these findings further highlight the unique features of the translation initiation process in trypanosomatid protozo.
nal purification of the heterotrimeric eIF4F was published over 30 years ago (Grifo, J. A., Tahara, S. M., Morgan, M. A., Shatkin, A. J., and Merrick, W. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5804-5810). Since that time, numerous studies have been performed with the three proteins specifically required for the translation initiation of natural mRNAs, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F. These have involved enzymatic and structural studies of the proteins and a number of site-directed mutagenesis studies. The regulation of translation exhibited through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is predominately seen as the phosphorylation of 4E-BP, an inhibitor of protein synthesis that functions by binding to the cap binding subunit of eIF4F (eIF4E). A hypothesis that requires the disassembly of eIF4F during translation initiation to yield free subunits (eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G) is presente.
ator of G protein signaling 10 (RGS10) protein is a GTPase activating protein that accelerates the hydrolysis of GTP and therefore canonically inactivates G proteins, ultimately terminating signaling. Rheb is a small GTPase protein that shuttles between its GDP- and GTP-bound forms to activate mTOR. Since RGS10 suppression augments ovarian cancer cell viability, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism. Following RGS10 suppression in serum-free conditions, phosphorylation of mTOR, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), p70S6K and S6 Ribosomal Protein appear. Furthermore, suppressing RGS10 increases activated Rheb, suggesting RGS10 antagonizes mTOR signaling via the small G-protein. The effects of RGS10 suppression are enhanced after stimulating cells with the growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and reduced with mTOR inhibitors, temsirolimus and INK-128. Suppression of RGS10 leads to an increase in cell proliferation, even in the presence of etoposide. In summary, the RGS10 suppression increases Rheb-GTP and mTOR signaling in ovarian cancer cells. Our results suggest that RGS10 could serve in a novel, and previously unknown, role by accelerating the hydrolysis of GTP from Rheb in ovarian cancer cell.
yotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which is the main composition factor of eIF4F translation initiation complex, influences the growth of tumor through modulating cap-dependent protein translation. Previous studies reported that ribavirin could suppress eIF4E-controlled translation and reduce the synthesis of onco-proteins. Here, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects of ribavirin alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukemia cell lines SUP-B15 (Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Ph+ ALL) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, CML). Our results showed that ribavirin had anti-proliferation effect; it down-regulated the phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTOR, 4EBP1, and eIF4E proteins in the mTOR/eIF4E signaling pathway, and MEK, ERK, Mnk1 and eIF4E proteins in ERK/Mnk1/eIF4E signaling pathway; reduced the expression of Mcl-1 (a translation substrates of eIF4F translation initiation complex) at protein synthesis level not mRNA transcriptional level; and induced cell apoptosis in both SUP-B15 and K562. 7-Methyl-guanosine cap affinity assay further demonstrated that ribavirin remarkably increased the eIF4E binding to 4EBP1 and decreased the combination of eIF4E with eIF4G, consequently resulting in a major inhibition of eIF4F complex assembly. The combination of ribavirin with imatinib enhanced antileukemic effects mentioned above, indicating that two drugs have synergistic anti-leukemic effect. Consistent with the cell lines, similar results were observed in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic primary leukemic blasts; however, the anti-proliferative role of ribavirin in other types of acute primary leukemic blasts was not obvious, which indicated that the anti-leukemic effect of ribavirin was different in cell lineage.
ine A (CsA) is widely used as an immunosuppressor in transplantation. Previous studies reported that CsA induces autophagy and that chronic treatment with CsA results in accumulation of autophagosomes and reduced autophagic clearance. Autophagy is a prosurvival process that promotes recovery from acute kidney injury by degrading misfolded proteins produced in the kidney. In the present study, we used TMBIM6-expressing HK-2, human kidney tubular cells (TMBIM6 cells) and Tmbim6 knockout (tmbim6(-/-)) mice. When exposed to CsA, the TMBIM6 cells maintained autophagy activity by preventing autophagosome accumulation. With regard to signaling, PRKKA/AMPK phosphorylation and mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) complex 1 (MTORC1) expression and its downstream target TFEB (transcription factor EB), a lysosome biogenesis factor, were regulated in the TMBIM6 cells. Lysosomal activity was highly increased or stably maintained in the presence of TMBIM6. In addition, treatment of tmbim6(-/-) mice with CsA resulted in increased autophagosome formation and decreased lysosome formation and activity. We also found that tmbim6(-/-) mice were susceptible to CsA-induced kidney injury. Taken together, these results indicate that TMBIM6 protects against CsA-induced nephrotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo by inducing autophagy and activating lysosome.
ular mechanisms underlying renal growth and renal growth-induced nephron damage remain poorly understood. Here, we report that in murine models, deletion of the tuberous sclerosis complex protein 1 (Tsc1) in renal proximal tubules induced strikingly enlarged kidneys, with minimal cystogenesis and occasional microscopic tumorigenesis. Signaling studies revealed hyperphosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and increased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) in activated renal tubules. Notably, knockin of a nonphosphorylatable rpS6 in these Tsc1-mutant mice exacerbated cystogenesis and caused drastic nephron damage and renal fibrosis, leading to kidney failure and a premature death rate of 67% by 9 weeks of age. In contrast, Tsc1 single-mutant mice were all alive and had far fewer renal cysts at this age. Mechanistic studies revealed persistent activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling causing hyperphosphorylation and consequent accumulation of 4E-BP1, along with greater cell proliferation, in the renal tubules of Tsc1 and rpS6 double-mutant mice. Furthermore, pharmacologic treatment of Tsc1 single-mutant mice with rapamycin reduced hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of 4E-BP1 but also inhibited phosphorylation of rpS6. Rapamycin also exacerbated cystic and fibrotic lesions and impaired kidney function in these mice, consequently leading to a premature death rate of 40% within 2 weeks of treatment, despite destroying tumors and decreasing kidney size. These findings indicate that Tsc1 prevents aberrant renal growth and tumorigenesis by inhibiting mTORC1 signaling, whereas phosphorylated rpS6 suppresses cystogenesis and fibrosis in Tsc1-deleted kidney.
ellular organisms, growth and proliferation is adjusted to nutritional conditions by a complex signaling network. The Insulin receptor/target of rapamycin (InR/TOR) signaling cascade plays a pivotal role in nutrient dependent growth regulation in Drosophila and mammals alike. Here we identify Cyclin G (CycG) as a regulator of growth and metabolism in Drosophila. CycG mutants have a reduced body size and weight and show signs of starvation accompanied by a disturbed fat metabolism. InR/TOR signaling activity is impaired in cycG mutants, combined with a reduced phosphorylation status of the kinase Akt1 and the downstream factors S6-kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP). Moreover, the expression and accumulation of Drosophila insulin like peptides (dILPs) is disturbed in cycG mutant brains. Using a reporter assay, we show that the activity of one of the first effectors of InR signaling, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K92E), is unaffected in cycG mutants. However, the metabolic defects and weight loss in cycG mutants were rescued by overexpression of Akt1 specifically in the fat body and by mutants in widerborst (wdb), the B'-subunit of the phosphatase PP2A, known to downregulate Akt1 by dephosphorylation. Together, our data suggest that CycG acts at the level of Akt1 to regulate growth and metabolism via PP2A in Drosophil.
c translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is an important factor regulating protein translation. It also impacts proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and the cell cycle of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between 4E-BP1 and human immune status, recognizing immunomodulatory molecules involved in the overexpression of 4E-BP.
rus expression system was used to overexpress 4E-BP1 in the H1299 cell line. Western blot was performed to investigate the expression level of 4E-BP1 and P-4E-BP1, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify gene expression of immunomodulatory molecule.
ssion level of 4E-BP1 increased significantly after lentivirus infection (P &lt; 0.05). Overexpression of 4E-BP1 upregulated the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β (P &lt; 0.05), IL-5 (P &lt; 0.001), IL-23 (P &lt; 0.001), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (P &lt; 0.001), Eota-3 (P &lt; 0.05), and MCP-4 (P &lt; 0.05). Most of the increases were observed at the seventh day. The variation trend of IL-10, cell division cycle protein 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and phosphatase and tensin homolog was not clea.
ssion of 4E-BP1 altered immune status by upregulating the expression of a series of immunomodulatory molecules, indicating that 4E-BP1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target against cance.
 of the insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway extend Drosophila lifespan. Based on genetic epistasis analyses, this longevity assurance is attributed to downstream effects of the FOXO transcription factor. However, as reported FOXO accounts for only a portion of the observed longevity benefit, suggesting there are additional outputs of IIS to mediate aging. One candidate is target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Reduced TORC1 activity is reported to slow aging, whereas reduced IIS is reported to repress TORC1 activity. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP) is repressed by TORC1, and activated 4E-BP is reported to increase Drosophila lifespan. Here we use genetic epistasis analyses to test whether longevity assurance mutants of chico, the Drosophila insulin receptor substrate homolog, require Drosophila d4eBP to slow aging. In chico heterozygotes, which are robustly long-lived, d4eBP is required but not sufficient to slow aging. Remarkably, d4eBP is not required or sufficient for chico homozygotes to extend longevity. Likewise, chico heterozygote females partially require d4eBP to preserve age-dependent locomotion, and both chico genotypes require d4eBP to improve stress-resistance. Reproduction and most measures of growth affected by either chico genotype are always independent of d4eBP. In females, chico heterozygotes paradoxically produce more rather than less phosphorylated 4E-BP (p4E-BP). Altered IRS function within the IIS pathway of Drosophila appears to have partial, conditional capacity to regulate aging through an unconventional interaction with 4E-B.
ed mRNA translation during brain development has been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 2 gene (Eif4ebp2), encoding the suppressor of mRNA translation initiation 4E-BP2, leads to an imbalance in excitatory-to-inhibitory neurotransmission and ASD-like behaviors. Inhibition of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) mGluR1 and mGluR5 reverses the autistic phenotypes in several ASD mouse models. Importantly, these receptors control synaptic physiology via activation of mRNA translation. We investigated the potential reversal of autistic-like phenotypes in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice by using antagonists of mGluR1 (JNJ16259685) or mGluR5 (fenobam). Augmented hippocampal mGluR-induced long-term depression (LTD; or chemically induced mGluR-LTD) in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice was rescued by mGluR1 or mGluR5 antagonists. While rescue by mGluR5 inhibition occurs through the blockade of a protein synthesis-dependent component of LTD, normalization by mGluR1 antagonists requires the activation of protein synthesis. Synaptically induced LTD was deficient in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice, and this deficit was not rescued by group I mGluR antagonists. Furthermore, a single dose of mGluR1 (0.3 mg/kg) or mGluR5 (3 mg/kg) antagonists in vivo reversed the deficits in social interaction and repetitive behaviors (marble burying) in Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrate that Eif4ebp2(-/-) mice serve as a relevant model to test potential therapies for ASD symptoms. In addition, we provide substantive evidence that the inhibition of mGluR1/mGluR5 is an effective treatment for physiological and behavioral alterations caused by exacerbated mRNA translation initiatio.
ed mRNA translation during brain development is associated with several autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We recently demonstrated that the deletion of a negative regulator of mRNA translation initiation, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2, leads to ASD-like behaviors and increased excitatory synaptic activity. Here we demonstrated that autistic behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes can be treated in adult mice with antagonists of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which have been previously used in other ASD models (i.e., fragile X syndrome). These findings support the use of group I mGluR antagonists as a potential therapy that extends to autism models involving exacerbated mRNA translation initiatio.
e mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) promotes translation as well as cell survival and proliferation under nutrient-rich conditions. Whereas mTOR activates translation through ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), how it facilitates cell proliferation has remained unclear. We have now identified p19(Arf), an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, as a novel substrate of S6K that is targeted to promote cell proliferation. Serum stimulation induced activation of the mTOR-S6K axis and consequent phosphorylation of p19(Arf) at Ser(75). Phosphorylated p19(Arf) was then recognized by the F-box protein β-TrCP2 and degraded by the proteasome. Ablation of β-TrCP2 thus led to the arrest of cell proliferation as a result of the stabilization and accumulation of p19(Arf). The β-TrCP2 paralog β-TrCP1 had no effect on p19(Arf) stability, suggesting that phosphorylated p19(Arf) is a specific substrate of β-TrCP2. Mice deficient in β-TrCP2 manifested accumulation of p19(Arf) in the yolk sac and died in utero. Our results suggest that the mTOR pathway promotes cell proliferation via β-TrCP2-dependent p19(Arf) degradation under nutrient-rich condition.
levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) enhance translation of many malignancy-related proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), c-Myc and osteopontin. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), levels of eIF4E are significantly increased compared with normal lung tissue. Here, we used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to inhibit the expression of eIF4E in NSCLC cell lines. eIF4E levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in NSCLC cells treated with eIF4E-specific ASO (4EASO) compared with control ASO. Treatment of NSCLC cells with the 4EASO resulted in decreased cap-dependent complex formation, decreased cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to gemcitabine. At the molecular level, repression of eIF4E with ASO resulted in decreased expression of the oncogenic proteins VEGF, c-Myc and osteopontin, whereas expression of β-actin was unaffected. Based on these findings, we conclude that eIF4E-silencing therapy alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy represents a promising approach deserving of further investigation in future NSCLC clinical trial.
axonal connectivity and hyperactive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) are shared features of several neurological disorders. Hyperactive mTORC1 alters axon length and polarity of hippocampal neurons in vitro, but the impact of hyperactive mTORC1 on axon growth in vivo and the mechanisms underlying those effects remain unclear. Using in utero electroporation during corticogenesis, we show that increasing mTORC1 activity accelerates axon growth without multiple axon formation. This was prevented by counteracting mTORC1 signaling through p70S6Ks (S6K1/2) or eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1/2), which both regulate translation. In addition to regulating translational targets, S6K1 indirectly signals through GSK3β, a regulator of axogenesis. Although blocking GSK3β activity did not alter axon growth under physiological conditions in vivo, blocking it using a dominant-negative mutant or lithium chloride prevented mTORC1-induced accelerated axon growth. These data reveal the contribution of translational and non-translational downstream effectors such as GSK3β to abnormal axon growth in neurodevelopmental mTORopathies and open new therapeutic options for restoring long-range connectivit.
nt study conducted a 9-week feeding trial to investigate the effects of threonine (Thr) on the digestion capacity and hepatopancreas gene expression of juvenile blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala). For this purpose, three tanks (300&nbsp;litres/tank) were randomly arranged and assigned to each experimental diet. Juvenile fish were fed with diets containing graded Thr levels (0·58, 1·08, 1·58, 2·08 or 2·58&nbsp;% of the diet) to apparent satiation four times daily. At the end of the feeding trial, the results indicated that hepatopancreas weight, hepatosomatic index, hepatopancreatic protein content, intestinal weight, intestosomatic index and intestinal protein content increased with increasing dietary Thr levels up to 1·58&nbsp;% and thereafter decreased (P&lt;&nbsp;0·05). The activities of chymotrypsin, trypsin, amylase and lipase elevated as dietary Thr levels increased up to 1·58&nbsp;% (P&lt;&nbsp;0·05), while these activities decreased in most cases after 1·58&nbsp;% dietary Thr except for chymotrypsin and trypsin in the hepatopancreas (plateau 1·58-2·08&nbsp;% Thr). The relative gene expression levels of chymotrypsin, trypsin, amylase, lipase, target of rapamycin and insulin-like growth factor-I were up-regulated, and the highest values were observed with 1·58&nbsp;% dietary Thr or 1·58 and 2·08&nbsp;% dietary Thr, whereas the relative gene expression levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 gradually decreased (P&lt;&nbsp;0·10) as dietary Thr levels increased up to 1·58&nbsp;% and thereafter significantly increased (P&lt;&nbsp;0·05), which could explain that about 1·58&nbsp;% dietary Thr could improve the growth and development of digestive organs and activities of digestive enzymes of juvenile blunt snout brea.
yotic translation initiation factor (eIF-4E) has recently been cloned from human, mouse, and yeast. This polypeptide is the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation apparatus and is involved in the mRNA-ribosome binding step of eukaryotic protein synthesis. We have designed oligonucleotide primers to the 3' untranslated region of the gene encoding eIF-4E and specifically amplified the human gene in human/rodent somatic cell hybrids using the polymerase chain reaction. By this method, one of the human eIF-4E genes (EIF4EL1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-like 1) has been mapped to human chromosome 4qter-4p15. In addition, we have localized a second eIF-4E gene (EIF4EL2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-like 2) to human chromosome 20 by Southern blot analysis of mapping panels established from human/rodent somatic cell hybrid.
y demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of an antibody-based experimental approach to identify microRNA functional targets from hundreds of predicted genes using miR-206 as an example. Using a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) antibody array, we identified 7 phosphorylated RTKs that were significantly differentially regulated after miR-206-mimic transfection. We then focused on MET, the most varied RTK, and bioinformatically constructed a MET-centred network using computationally predicted miR-206 targets. Within this network, we analyzed two validated targets, PAX3 and SNX2, and one candidate target, EIF4E, may account for the inhibitory effect of miR-206 on MET phosphorylation. Luciferase and Western-blot assays indicated that EIF4E was a direct target of miR-206. This concept may also be applicable for other microRNAs and other antibody array platform.
e major cap-binding protein, has long been considered limiting for translating the mammalian genome. However, the eIF4E dose requirement at an organismal level remains unexplored. By generating an Eif4e haploinsufficient mouse, we found that a 50% reduction in eIF4E expression, while compatible with normal development and global protein synthesis, significantly impeded cellular transformation. Genome-wide translational profiling uncovered a translational program induced by oncogenic transformation and revealed a critical role for the dose of eIF4E, specifically in translating a network of mRNAs enriched for a unique 5' UTR signature. In particular, we demonstrate that the dose of eIF4E is essential for translating mRNAs that regulate reactive oxygen species, fueling transformation and cancer cell survival in vivo. Our findings indicate eIF4E is maintained at levels in excess for normal development that are hijacked by cancer cells to drive a translational program supporting tumorigenesi.
c translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is overexpressed early in breast cancers in association with disease progression and reduced survival. Much remains to be understood regarding the role of eIF4E in human cancer. We determined, using immortalized human breast epithelial cells, that elevated expression of eIF4E translationally activates the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway, promoting cell invasion, a loss of cell polarity, increased cell survival, and other hallmarks of early neoplasia. Overexpression of eIF4E is shown to facilitate the selective translation of integrin β1 mRNA, which drives the translationally controlled assembly of a TGF-β receptor signaling complex containing α3β1 integrins, β-catenin, TGF-β receptor I, E-cadherin, and phosphorylated Smad2/3. This receptor complex acutely sensitizes nonmalignant breast epithelial cells to activation by typically substimulatory levels of activated TGF-β. TGF-β can promote cellular differentiation or invasion and transformation. As a translational coactivator of TGF-β, eIF4E confers selective mRNA translation, reprogramming nonmalignant cells to an invasive phenotype by reducing the set point for stimulation by activated TGF-β. Overexpression of eIF4E may be a proinvasive facilitator of TGF-β activit.
lian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a critical regulator of protein synthesis. The best studied targets of mTORC1 in translation are the eukaryotic initiation factor-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). In this study, we identify the La-related protein 1 (LARP1) as a key novel target of mTORC1 with a fundamental role in terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation. Recent genome-wide studies indicate that TOP and TOP-like mRNAs compose a large portion of the mTORC1 translatome, but the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation is incompletely understood. Here, we report that LARP1 functions as a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1. Our data show the following: (i) LARP1 associates with mTORC1 via RAPTOR; (ii) LARP1 interacts with TOP mRNAs in an mTORC1-dependent manner; (iii) LARP1 binds the 5'TOP motif to repress TOP mRNA translation; and (iv) LARP1 competes with the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G for TOP mRNA binding. Importantly, from a drug resistance standpoint, our data also show that reducing LARP1 protein levels by RNA interference attenuates the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, Torin1, and amino acid deprivation on TOP mRNA translation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that LARP1 functions as an important repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC.
dian (∼24 h) clock is continuously entrained (reset) by ambient light so that endogenous rhythms are synchronized with daily changes in the environment. Light-induced gene expression is thought to be the molecular mechanism underlying clock entrainment. mRNA translation is a key step of gene expression, but the manner in which clock entrainment is controlled at the level of mRNA translation is not well understood. We found that a light- and circadian clock-regulated MAPK/MNK pathway led to phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eIF4E in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the locus of the master circadian clock in mammals. Phosphorylation of eIF4E specifically promoted translation of Period 1 (Per1) and Period 2 (Per2) mRNAs and increased the abundance of basal and inducible PER proteins, which facilitated circadian clock resetting and precise timekeeping. Together, these results highlight a critical role for light-regulated translational control in the physiology of the circadian cloc.
llates are eukaryotes with unusual cell biology and appear to rely on translational rather than transcriptional control of gene expression. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) plays an important role in regulating gene expression because eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap is a control point for translation. eIF4E is part of an extended, eukaryote-specific family with different members having specific functions, based on studies of model organisms. Dinoflagellate eIF4E diversity could provide a mechanism for dinoflagellates to regulate gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner. Accordingly, eIF4E family members from eleven core dinoflagellate transcriptomes were surveyed to determine the diversity and phylogeny of the eIF4E family in dinoflagellates and related lineages including apicomplexans, ciliates and heterokont.
y uncovered eight to fifteen (on average eleven) different eIF4E family members in each core dinoflagellate species. The eIF4E family members from heterokonts and dinoflagellates segregated into three clades, suggesting at least three eIF4E cognates were present in their common ancestor. However, these three clades are distinct from the three previously described eIF4E classes, reflecting diverse approaches to a central eukaryotic function. Heterokonts contain four clades, ciliates two and apicomplexans only a single recognizable eIF4E clade. In the core dinoflagellates, the three clades were further divided into nine sub-clades based on the phylogenetic analysis and species representation. Six of the sub-clades included at least one member from all eleven core dinoflagellate species, suggesting duplication in their shared ancestor. Conservation within sub-clades varied, suggesting different selection pressure.
tic analysis of eIF4E in core dinoflagellates revealed complex layering of duplication and conservation when compared to other eukaryotes. Our results suggest that the diverse eIF4E family in core dinoflagellates may provide a toolkit to enable selective translation as a strategy for controlling gene expression in these enigmatic eukaryote.
l transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) functions as a tumor suppressor via immune regulatory and cell-autonomous pathways. Herein, we report a previously unidentified cell-autonomous Stat1 function, which is its ability to exhibit both antiproliferative and prosurvival properties by facilitating translation of mRNAs encoding for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) and antiapoptotic proteins X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and B-cell lymphoma xl. Translation of the select mRNAs requires the transcriptional function of Stat1, resulting in the up-regulation of the p110γ subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) class IB and increased expression of the translational repressor translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Increased PI3Kγ signaling promotes the degradation of the eIF4A inhibitor programmed cell death protein 4, which favors the cap-independent translation of the select mRNAs under conditions of general inhibition of protein synthesis by up-regulated eIF4E-binding protein 1. As such, Stat1 inhibits cell proliferation but also renders cells increasingly resistant to antiproliferative effects of pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and/or mammalian target of rapamycin. Stat1 also protects Ras-transformed cells from the genotoxic effects of doxorubicin in culture and immune-deficient mice. Our findings demonstrate an important role of mRNA translation in the cell-autonomous Stat1 functions, with implications in tumor growth and treatment with chemotherapeutic drug.
g proteins (4E-BPs) play an important role in the regulation of translation by binding to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and inhibiting assembly of the eIF4F complex. While phosphorylation of 4E-BPs is known to disrupt their binding to eIF4E, the mechanism by which this occurs has been unclear. In a recent study, Forman-Kay and coworkers demonstrate that this mechanism is primarily structure-based: phosphorylation of 4E-BPs results in a disorder-to-order transition, bringing them from their binding-competent disordered state to a folded state incompatible with eIF4E bindin.
ses cause immunodeficiency and cancer but also are used as vectors for the expression of heterologous genes. Nevertheless, optimal translation of introduced genes often is not achieved. Here we show that transfection into mammalian cells of lentiviral or gammaretroviral vectors, including those with specific shRNAs, increased expression of a cotransfected gene relative to standard plasmid vectors. Levels of most endogenous cellular proteins were unchanged. Transfer of lentiviral vector sequences into a standard plasmid conferred the ability to give increased expression of cotransfected genes (superinduction). Superinduction by the retroviral vector was not dependent on the cell type or species, the type of reporter gene, or the method of transfection. No differences were detected in the IFN, unfolded protein, or stress responses in the presence of retroviral vectors. RT-PCRs revealed that RNA levels of cotransfected genes were unchanged during superinduction, yet Western blotting, pulse labeling, and the use of bicistronic vectors showed increased cap-dependent translation of cointroduced genes. Expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase target 4E-BP1, but not the mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, preferentially inhibited superinduction relative to basal protein expression. Furthermore, transcription of lentiviral vector sequences from a doxycycline-inducible promoter eliminated superinduction, consistent with a DNA-triggered event. Thus, retroviral DNA increased translation of cointroduced genes in trans by an mTOR-independent signaling mechanism. Our experiments have broad applications for the design of retroviral vectors for transfections, DNA vaccines, and gene therap.
on is a complex process involving diverse cellular proteins, including the translation initiation factor eIF4E, which has been shown to be a protein that is a point for translational regulation. Viruses require components from the host cell to complete their replication cycles. Various studies show how eIF4E and its regulatory cellular proteins are manipulated during viral infections. Interestingly, viral action mechanisms in eIF4E are diverse and have an impact not only on viral protein synthesis, but also on other aspects that are important for the replication cycle, such as the proliferation of infected cells and stimulation of viral reactivation. This review shows how some viruses use eIF4E and its regulatory proteins for their own benefit in order to spread themselve.
dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is a most frequent autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-associated gene and the only protein significantly decreasing in the serum of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Is ADNP associated with ASD being more prevalent in boys and AD more prevalent in women? Our results revealed sex-related learning/memory differences in mice, reflecting hippocampal expression changes in ADNP and ADNP-controlled AD/ASD risk genes. Hippocampal ADNP transcript content was doubled in male vs female mice, with females showing equal expression to ADNP haploinsufficient (ADNP(+/)(-)) males and no significant genotype-associated reduction. Increased male ADNP expression was replicated in human postmortem hippocampal samples. The hippocampal transcript for apolipoprotein E (the major risk gene for AD) was doubled in female mice compared with males, and further doubled in the ADNP(+/-) females, contrasting a decrease in ADNP(+/-) males. Previously, overexpression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) led to ASD-like phenotype in mice. Here, we identified binding sites on ADNP for eIF4E and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, hippocampal eIF4E expression was specifically increased in young ADNP(+/-) male mice. Behaviorally, ADNP(+/-) male mice exhibited deficiencies in object recognition and social memory compared with ADNP(+/+) mice, while ADNP(+/-) females were partially spared. Contrasting males, which preferred novel over familiar mice, ADNP(+/+) females showed no preference to novel mice and ADNP(+/-) females did not prefer mice over object. ADNP expression, positioned as a master regulator of key ASD and AD risk genes, introduces a novel concept of hippocampal gene-regulated sexual dimorphism and an ADNP(+/-) animal model for translational psychiatr.
esis and in vitro and in vivo antibreast and antiprostate cancers activities of novel C-4 heteroaryl 13-cis-retinamides that modulate Mnk-eIF4E and AR signaling are discussed. Modifications of the C-4 heteroaryl substituents reveal that the 1H-imidazole is essential for high anticancer activity. The most potent compounds against a variety of human breast and prostate cancer (BC/PC) cell lines were compounds 16 (VNHM-1-66), 20 (VNHM-1-81), and 22 (VNHM-1-73). In these cell lines, the compounds induce Mnk1/2 degradation to substantially suppress eIF4E phosphorylation. In PC cells, the compounds induce degradation of both full-length androgen receptor (fAR) and splice variant AR (AR-V7) to inhibit AR transcriptional activity. More importantly, VNHM-1-81 has strong in vivo antibreast and antiprostate cancer activities, while VNHM-1-73 exhibited strong in vivo antibreast cancer activity, with no apparent host toxicity. Clearly, these lead compounds are strong candidates for development for the treatments of human breast and prostate cancer.
e response signaling is crucial for genome maintenance in all organisms and is corrupted in cancer. In an RNA interference (RNAi) screen for (de)ubiquitinases and sumoylases modulating the apoptotic response of embryonic stem (ES) cells to DNA damage, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase/ISGylase, ariadne homologue 1 (ARIH1). Silencing ARIH1 sensitized ES and cancer cells to genotoxic compounds and ionizing radiation, irrespective of their p53 or caspase-3 status. Expression of wild-type but not ubiquitinase-defective ARIH1 constructs prevented sensitization caused by ARIH1 knockdown. ARIH1 protein abundance increased after DNA damage through attenuation of proteasomal degradation that required ATM signaling. Accumulated ARIH1 associated with 4EHP, and in turn, this competitive inhibitor of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) underwent increased nondegradative ubiquitination upon DNA damage. Genotoxic stress led to an enrichment of ARIH1 in perinuclear, ribosome-containing regions and triggered 4EHP association with the mRNA 5' cap as well as mRNA translation arrest in an ARIH1-dependent manner. Finally, restoration of DNA damage-induced translation arrest in ARIH1-depleted cells by means of an eIF2 inhibitor was sufficient to reinstate resistance to genotoxic stress. These findings identify ARIH1 as a potent mediator of DNA damage-induced translation arrest that protects stem and cancer cells against genotoxic stres.
otic cells, the rate-limiting component for cap-dependent mRNA translation is the translation initiation factor eIF4E. eIF4E is overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies, but whether it has a role in melanoma remains obscure. We hypothesized that eIF4E promotes melanoma cell proliferation and facilitates the development of acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. We show that eIF4E is overexpressed in a panel of melanoma cell lines, compared with immortalized melanocytes. Knockdown of eIF4E significantly repressed the proliferation of a subset of melanoma cell lines. Moreover, in BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines, vemurafenib inhibits 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, thus promoting its binding to eIF4E. Cap-binding and polysome profiling analysis confirmed that vemurafenib stabilizes the eIF4E-4E-BP1 association and blocks mRNA translation, respectively. Conversely, in cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib, there is an increased dependence on eIF4E for survival; 4E-BP1 is highly phosphorylated and thus eIF4E-4E-BP1 associations are impeded. Moreover, increasing eIF4E activity by silencing 4E-BP1/2 renders vemurafenib-responsive cells more resistant to BRAF inhibition. In conclusion, these data suggest that therapeutically targeting eIF4E may be a viable means of inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation and overcoming vemurafenib resistanc.
the MAP kinase-interacting kinases (MNKs) have been known for &gt;15 years, their roles in the regulation of protein synthesis have remained obscure. Here, we explore the involvement of the MNKs in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-stimulated protein synthesis in cortical neurons from mice. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that BDNF-induced upregulation of protein synthesis requires MEK/ERK signaling and the downstream kinase, MNK1, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. Translation initiation is mediated by the interaction of eIF4E with the m(7)GTP cap of mRNA and with eIF4G. The latter interaction is inhibited by the interactions of eIF4E with partner proteins, such as CYFIP1, which acts as a translational repressor. We find that BDNF induces the release of CYFIP1 from eIF4E, and that this depends on MNK1. Finally, using a novel combination of BONCAT and SILAC, we identify a subset of proteins whose synthesis is upregulated by BDNF signaling via MNK1 in neurons. Interestingly, this subset of MNK1-sensitive proteins is enriched for functions involved in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we find significant overlap between our subset of proteins whose synthesis is regulated by MNK1 and those encoded by known FMRP-binding mRNAs. Together, our data implicate MNK1 as a key component of BDNF-mediated translational regulation in neuron.
lation initiation factor eIF4E is an oncogene that is commonly overexpressed in primary breast cancers and metastases. In this article, we report that a pharmacologic inhibitor of eIF4E function, ribavirin, safely and potently suppresses breast tumor formation. Ribavirin administration blocked the growth of primary breast tumors in several murine models and reduced the development of lung metastases in an invasive model. Mechanistically, eIF4E silencing or blockade reduced the invasiveness and metastatic capability of breast cancer cells in a manner associated with decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-9. Furthermore, eIF4E silencing or ribavirin treatment suppressed features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process crucial for metastasis. Our findings offer a preclinical rationale to explore broadening the clinical evaluation of ribavirin, currently being tested in patients with eIF4E-overexpressing leukemia, as a strategy to treat solid tumors such as metastatic breast cance.
dent translation is a potential cancer-related target (oncotarget) due to its critical role in cancer initiation and progression. 4EGI-1, an inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, was discovered by screening chemical libraries of small molecules. 4EGI-1 inhibits cap-dependent translation initiation by impairing the assembly of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex, and therefore is a potential anti-cancer agent. Here, we report that 4EGI-1 also inhibits mTORC1 signaling independent of its inhibitory role on cap-dependent translation initiation. The inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by 4EGI-1 activates Akt due to both abrogation of the negative feedback loops from mTORC1 to PI3K and activation of mTORC2. We further validated that mTORC2 activity is required for 4EGI-1-mediated Akt activation. The activated Akt counteracted the anticancer effects of 4EGI-1. In support of this model, inhibition of Akt potentiates the antitumor activity of 4EGI-1 both in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model in vivo. Our results suggest that a combination of 4EGI-1and Akt inhibitor is a rational approach for the treatment of cance.
-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are a diverse class of translation regulators that share a canonical eIF4E-binding motif (4E-BM) with eIF4G. Consequently, they compete with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, thereby inhibiting translation initiation. Mextli (Mxt) is an unusual 4E-BP that promotes translation by also interacting with eIF3. Here we present the crystal structures of the eIF4E-binding regions of the Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce) Mxt proteins in complex with eIF4E in the cap-bound and cap-free states. The structures reveal unexpected evolutionary plasticity in the eIF4E-binding mode, with a classical bipartite interface for Ce Mxt and a novel tripartite interface for Dm Mxt. Both interfaces comprise a canonical helix and a noncanonical helix that engage the dorsal and lateral surfaces of eIF4E, respectively. Remarkably, Dm Mxt contains a C-terminal auxiliary helix that lies anti-parallel to the canonical helix on the eIF4E dorsal surface. In contrast to the eIF4G and Ce Mxt complexes, the Dm eIF4E-Mxt complexes are resistant to competition by bipartite 4E-BPs, suggesting that Dm Mxt can bind eIF4E when eIF4G binding is inhibited. Our results uncovered unexpected diversity in the binding modes of 4E-BPs, resulting in eIF4E complexes that display differential sensitivity to 4E-BP regulatio.
on initiation factors (eIFs) are over-activated in many human cancers and may contribute to their progression. The small molecule 4EGI-1, a potent inhibitor of translation initiation through disrupting eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, has been shown to exert anti-cancer effects in human cancer cells. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of 4EGI-1 in human glioma U251 cells. We found that 4EGI-1 impaired the assembly of the eIF4F complex, and inhibited proliferation of U251 cells via inducing apoptosis. 4EGI-1 treatment induced collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were prevented by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). In addition, 4EGI-1 inhibited mitochondrial ATP synthesis via suppressing complex I activity, but had no effects on mitochondrial biogenesis. The results of fluorescence staining showed that 4EGI-1 indeed fragmented the mitochondrial network of U251 cells. We found a significant decrease in optic atrophy type 1 (Opa-1) and mitofusin 1 (Mfn-1) related to fusion proteins as well as an increase in fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1). Furthermore, the anti-cancer effects of 4GI-1 were partially nullified by knock down of Drp-1 using siRNA. These data indicate that the use of inhibitors that directly target the translation initiation complex eIF4F could represent a potential novel approach for human glioma therap.
n of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the central event of liver fibrosis. The translational machinery is an optimized molecular network that affects cellular homoeostasis and diseases, whereas the role of protein translation in HSCs activation and liver fibrosis is little defined. Our previous report suggests that up-regulation of receptor for activated C-kinase 1(RACK1) in HSCs is critical for liver fibrogenesis. In this study, we found that RACK1 promoted macrophage conditioned medium (MCM)-induced assembly of eIF4F and phosphorylation of eIF4E in primary HSCs. RACK1 enhanced the translation and expression of pro-fibrogenic factors collagen 1α1, snail and cyclin E1 induced by MCM. Administration of PP242 or knock-down of eIF4E suppressed RACK1-stimulated collagen 1α1 production, proliferation and migration in primary HSCs. In addition, depletion of eIF4E attenuated thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis in vivo. Our data suggest that RACK1-mediated stimulation of cap-dependent translation plays crucial roles in HSCs activation and liver fibrogenesis, and targeting translation initiation could be a promising strategy for the treatment of liver fibrosi.
ed mRNA translation has been implicated in disease development and in part is controlled by a eukaryotic initiation complex eIF4F (composed of eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A). We demonstrate here that the cap bound fraction from lymphoma cells was enriched with eIF4G and eIF4E indicating that lymphoma cells exist in an activated translational state. Moreover, 77% (110/142) of diffuse large B cell lymphoma tumors expressed eIF4E and this was associated with an inferior event free survival. Over-expression of wild-type eIF4E (eIF4E(WT)) but not cap-mutant eIF4E (eIF4E(cap mutant)) increased the activation of the eIF4F complex. Treatment with the active-site dual mTOR inhibitor CC214-1 reduced the level of the eIF4F complex by decreasing the cap bound fraction of eIF4G and increasing the levels of 4E-BP1. CC214-1 inhibited both the cap dependent and global protein translation. CC214-1 inhibited c-Myc, and cyclin D3 translation by decreasing polysomal fractions from lymphoma cells. Inhibition of eIF4E with shRNA further decreased the CC214-1 induced inhibition of the eIF4F complex, c-Myc, cyclin D3 translation, and colony formation. These studies demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is deregulated in aggressive lymphoma and that dual mTOR therapy has therapeutic potential in these patient.
n is a highly regulated rate-limiting step of mRNA translation. During cap-dependent translation, the cap-binding protein eIF4E recruits the mRNA to the ribosome. Specific elements in the 5'UTR of some mRNAs referred to as Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESes) allow direct association of the mRNA with the ribosome without the requirement for eIF4E. Cap-independent initiation permits translation of a subset of cellular and viral mRNAs under conditions wherein cap-dependent translation is inhibited, such as stress, mitosis and viral infection. DAP5 is an eIF4G homolog that has been proposed to regulate both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation. Herein, we demonstrate that DAP5 associates with eIF2β and eIF4AI to stimulate IRES-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs. In contrast, DAP5 is dispensable for cap-dependent translation. These findings provide the first mechanistic insights into the function of DAP5 as a selective regulator of cap-independent translatio.
ing data indicate translation plays a role in cancer biology, particularly its rate limiting stage of initiation. Despite this evolving recognition, the function and importance of specific translation initiation factors is unresolved. The eukaryotic translation initiation complex eIF4F consists of eIF4E and eIF4G at a 1:1 ratio. Although it is expected that they display interdependent functions, several publications suggest independent mechanisms. This study is the first to directly assess the relative contribution of eIF4F components to the expressed cellular proteome, transcription factors, microRNAs, and phenotype in a malignancy known for extensive protein synthesis-multiple myeloma (MM). Previously, we have shown that eIF4E/eIF4GI attenuation (siRNA/Avastin) deleteriously affected MM cells' fate and reduced levels of eIF4E/eIF4GI established targets. Here, we demonstrated that eIF4E/eIF4GI indeed have individual influences on cell proteome. We used an objective, high throughput assay of mRNA microarrays to examine the significance of eIF4E/eIF4GI silencing to several cellular facets such as transcription factors, microRNAs and phenotype. We showed different imprints for eIF4E and eIF4GI in all assayed aspects. These results promote our understanding of the relative contribution and importance of eIF4E and eIF4GI to the malignant phenotype and shed light on their function in eIF4F translation initiation comple.
have addressed the mechanisms that determine genesis of the correct numbers of neurons during development, focusing on the embryonic cortex. We identify in neural precursors a repressive complex involving eIF4E1 and its binding partner 4E-T that coordinately represses translation of proteins that determine neurogenesis. This eIF4E1/4E-T complex is present in granules with the processing body proteins Lsm1 and Rck, and disruption of this complex causes premature and enhanced neurogenesis and neural precursor depletion. Analysis of the 4E-T complex shows that it is highly enriched in mRNAs encoding transcription factors and differentiation-related proteins. These include the proneurogenic bHLH mRNAs, which colocalize with 4E-T in granules and whose protein products are aberrantly upregulated following knockdown of eIF4E, 4E-T, or processing body proteins. Thus, neural precursors are transcriptionally primed to generate neurons, but an eIF4E/4E-T complex sequesters and represses translation of proneurogenic proteins to determine appropriate neurogenesi.
romotes tumor evolution and metastasis, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key regulator of hypoxia-related cellular processes in cancer. The eIF4E translation initiation factors, eIF4E1, eIF4E2, and eIF4E3, are essential for translation initiation. However, whether and how HIF-1α affects cap-dependent translation through eIF4Es in hypoxic cancer cells has been unknown. Here, we report that HIF-1α promoted cap-dependent translation of selective mRNAs through up-regulation of eIF4E1 in hypoxic breast cancer cells. Hypoxia-promoted breast cancer tumorsphere growth was HIF-1α-dependent. We found that eIF4E1, not eIF4E2 or eIF4E3, is the dominant eIF4E family member in breast cancer cells under both normoxia and hypoxia conditions. eIF4E3 expression was largely sequestered in breast cancer cells at normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia up-regulated the expression of eIF4E1 and eIF4E2, but only eIF4E1 expression was HIF-1α-dependent. In hypoxic cancer cells, HIF-1α-up-regulated eIF4E1 enhanced cap-dependent translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins important for breast cancer cell mammosphere growth. In searching for correlations, we discovered that human eIF4E1 promoter harbors multiple potential hypoxia response elements. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase and point mutation assays, we found that HIF-1α utilized hypoxia response elements in the human eIF4E1 proximal promoter region to activate eIF4E1 expression. Our study suggests that HIF-1α promotes cap-dependent translation of selective mRNAs through up-regulating eIF4E1, which contributes to tumorsphere growth of breast cancer cells at hypoxia. The data shown provide new insights into protein synthesis mechanisms in cancer cells at low oxygen level.
r of paralogs of proteins involved in translation initiation is larger in trypanosomes than in yeasts or many metazoan and includes two poly(A) binding proteins, PABP1 and PABP2, and four eIF4E variants. In many cases, the paralogs are individually essential and are thus unlikely to have redundant functions although, as yet, distinct functions of different isoforms have not been determined. Here, trypanosome PABP1 and PABP2 have been further characterised. PABP1 and PABP2 diverged subsequent to the differentiation of the Kinetoplastae lineage, supporting the existence of specific aspects of translation initiation regulation. PABP1 and PABP2 exhibit major differences in intracellular localization and distribution on polysome fractionation under various conditions that interfere with mRNA metabolism. Most striking are differences in localization to the four known types of inducible RNP granules. Moreover, only PABP2 but not PABP1 can accumulate in the nucleus. Taken together, these observations indicate that PABP1 and PABP2 likely associate with distinct populations of mRNAs. The differences in localization to inducible RNP granules also apply to paralogs of components of the eIF4F complex: eIF4E1 showed similar localization pattern to PABP2, whereas the localisation of eIF4E4 and eIF4G3 resembled that of PABP1. The grouping of translation initiation as either colocalizing with PABP1 or with PABP2 can be used to complement interaction studies to further define the translation initiation complexes in kinetoplastid.
on to being essential for translation of eukaryotic mRNA, translation initiation factors are also key components of plant-virus interactions. In order to address the involvement of these factors in the infectious cycle of poleroviruses (aphid-transmitted, phloem-limited viruses), the accumulation of three poleroviruses was followed in Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines impaired in the synthesis of translation initiation factors in the eIF4E and eIF4G families. We found that efficient accumulation of Turnip yellows virus (TuYV) in A. thaliana relies on the presence of eIF (iso)4G1, whereas Beet mild yellowing virus (BMYV) and Beet western yellows virus-USA (BWYV-USA) rely, instead, on eIF4E1. A role for these factors in the infectious processes of TuYV and BMYV was confirmed by direct interaction in yeast between these specific factors and the 5' viral genome-linked protein of the related virus. Although the underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown, this study reveals a totally unforeseen situation in which closely related viruses belonging to the same genus use different translation initiation factors for efficient infection of A. thalian.
yotic translation initiation factor eIF4E plays a key role in plant-potyvirus interactions. eIF4E belongs to a small multigenic family and three genes, eIF4E1, eIF4E2 and eIF(iso)4E, have been identified in tomato. It has been demonstrated that eIF4E-mediated natural recessive resistances against potyviruses result from non-synonymous mutations in an eIF4E protein, which impair its direct interaction with the potyviral protein VPg. In tomato, the role of eIF4E proteins in potyvirus resistance is still unclear because natural or induced mutations in eIF4E1 confer only a narrow resistance spectrum against potyviruses. This contrasts with the broad spectrum resistance identified in the natural diversity of tomato. These results suggest that more than one eIF4E protein form is involved in the observed broad spectrum resistanc.
nsight into the respective contribution of each eIF4E protein in tomato-potyvirus interactions, two tomato lines silenced for both eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 (RNAi-4E) and two lines silenced for eIF(iso)4E (RNAi-iso4E) were obtained and characterized. RNAi-4E lines are slightly impaired in their growth and fertility, whereas no obvious growth defects were observed in RNAi-iso4E lines. The F1 hybrid between RNAi-4E and RNAi-iso4E lines presented a pronounced semi-dwarf phenotype. Interestingly, the RNAi-4E lines silenced for both eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 showed broad spectrum resistance to potyviruses while the RNAi-iso4E lines were fully susceptible to potyviruses. Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays between the three eIF4E proteins and a set of viral VPgs identified two types of VPgs: those that interacted only with eIF4E1 and those that interacted with either eIF4E1 or with eIF4E.
eriments provide evidence for the involvement of both eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 in broad spectrum resistance of tomato against potyviruses and suggest a role for eIF4E2 in tomato-potyvirus interaction.
on initiation in eukaryotes requires eIF4E, the cap binding protein, which mediates its function through an interaction with the scaffolding protein eIF4G, as part of the eIF4F complex. In trypanosomatids, four eIF4E homologues have been described but the specific function of each is not well characterized. Here, we report a study of these proteins in Trypanosoma brucei (TbEIF4E1 through 4). At the sequence level, they can be assigned to two groups: TbEIF4E1 and 2, similar in size to metazoan eIF4E1; and TbEIF4E3 and 4, with long N-terminal extensions. All are constitutively expressed, but whilst TbEIF4E1 and 2 localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, TbEIF4E3 and 4 are strictly cytoplasmic and are also more abundant. After knockdown through RNAi, TbEIF4E3 was the only homologue confirmed to be essential for viability of the insect procyclic form. In contrast, TbEIF4E1, 3 and 4 were all essential for the mammalian bloodstream form. Simultaneous RNAi knockdown of TbEIF4E1 and 2 caused cessation of growth and death in procyclics, but with a delayed impact on translation, whilst knockdown of TbEIF4E3 alone or a combined TbEIF4E1 and 4 knockdown led to substantial translation inhibition which preceded cellular death by several days, at least. Only TbEIF4E3 and 4 were found to interact with T. brucei eIF4G homologues; TbEIF4E3 bound both TbEIF4G3 and 4 whilst TbEIF4E4 bound only to TbEIF4G3. These results are consistent with TbEIF4E3 and 4 having distinct but relevant roles in initiation of protein synthesi.
nt study is the first report providing evidence for a physiological role of a truncated form of the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E1). Our initial observation was that eIF4E, which mediates the mRNA cap function by recruiting the eIF4F complex (composed of eIF4E, 4G and 4A), occurs in two forms in porcine endometrial tissue in a strictly temporally restricted fashion. The ubiquitous prototypical 25&nbsp;kDa form of eIF4E was found in ovariectomized and cyclic animals. A new stable&nbsp;23&nbsp;kDa variant, however, is predominant during early pregnancy at the time of implantation. Northern blotting, cDNA sequence analysis, in vitro protease assays and MS showed that the 23&nbsp;kDa form does not belong to a new class of eIF4E proteins. It represents a proteolytically processed variant of eIF4E1, lacking not more than 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. Steroid replacements indicated that progesterone in combination with 17β-oestradiol induced the formation of the 23&nbsp;kDa eIF4E. Modified cell-free translation systems mimicking the situation in the endometrium revealed that, besides eIF4E, eIF4G was also truncated, but not eIF4A or PABP [poly(A)-binding protein]. The 23&nbsp;kDa form of eIF4E reduced the repressive function of 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1) and the truncated eIF4G lacked the PABP-binding site. Thus we suggest that the truncated eIF4E provides an alternative regulation mechanism by an altered dynamic of eIF4E/4E-BP1 binding under conditions where 4E-BP1 is hypophosphorylated. Together with the impaired eIF4G-PABP interaction, the modified translational initiation might particularly regulate protein synthesis during conceptus attachment at the time of implantatio.
cterization of natural recessive resistance genes and Arabidopsis virus-resistant mutants have implicated translation initiation factors of the eIF4E and eIF4G families as susceptibility factors required for virus infection and resistance functio.
igate further the role of translation initiation factors in virus resistance we set up a TILLING platform in tomato, cloned genes encoding for translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G and screened for induced mutations that lead to virus resistance. A splicing mutant of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, S.l_eIF4E1 G1485A, was identified and characterized with respect to cap binding activity and resistance spectrum. Molecular analysis of the transcript of the mutant form showed that both the second and the third exons were miss-spliced, leading to a truncated mRNA. The resulting truncated eIF4E1 protein is also impaired in cap-binding activity. The mutant line had no growth defect, likely because of functional redundancy with others eIF4E isoforms. When infected with different potyviruses, the mutant line was immune to two strains of Potato virus Y and Pepper mottle virus and susceptible to Tobacco each viru.
analysis of translation initiation factors shows that translation initiation factors of the eIF4E family are determinants of plant susceptibility to RNA viruses and viruses have adopted strategies to use different isoforms. This work also demonstrates the effectiveness of TILLING as a reverse genetics tool to improve crop species. We have also developed a complete tool that can be used for both forward and reverse genetics in tomato, for both basic science and crop improvement. By opening it to the community, we hope to fulfill the expectations of both crop breeders and scientists who are using tomato as their model of stud.
criptionally active, growing oocyte accumulates mRNAs essential for early stages of development, the oocyte-to-embryo transition, in a stable, dormant form. Translational repression of mRNAs in eggs of various species is conferred by interactions, either direct or via intermediate proteins, of repressive factors bound to the 3'-untranslated regions with the proteins of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) family bound to the 5'-cap of the transcripts. Recently, a novel oocyte-specific eIF4E encoded by the Eif41b gene in mammals has been identified by our group. To further investigate this gene, the available cDNA libraries, as well as genome assemblies of nonmammalian vertebrates, were surveyed. This analysis revealed that the Eif4e1b gene arose in Tetrapoda as a result of the ancestral Eif4e locus duplication. Unlike other known proteins of three subfamilies comprising eIF4E family (eIF4E1, eIF4E2, and eIF4E3), cDNA library evidence suggests that Eif41b locus has an oocyte-restricted expression across all classes of Tetrapoda. To further understand the role of eIF4E1B during oocyte maturation, injections of antisense morpholino nucleotides in the X. tropicalis fully-grown stage VI oocytes were performed. The resulted ablation of eIF4E1B protein led to significant acceleration of oocyte maturation after progesterone induction; morpholino-injected oocytes formed the metaphase plate 30 min faster than the control groups. These results suggest that eIF4E1B protein acts as a repressor in translational regulation of maternal mRNAs activated during, and required for, oocyte maturatio.
c translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds to the m(7)GTP of capped mRNAs and is an essential component of the translational machinery that recruits the 40S small ribosomal subunit. We describe here the identification and characterization of two eIF4E homologues in an ancient protist, Giardia lamblia. Using m(7)GTP-Sepharose affinity column chromatography, a specific binding protein was isolated and identified as Giardia eIF4E2. The other homologue, Giardia eIF4E1, bound only to the m(2,2,7)GpppN structure. Although neither homologue can rescue the function of yeast eIF4E, a knockdown of eIF4E2 mRNA in Giardia by a virus-based antisense ribozyme decreased translation, which was shown to use m(7)GpppN-capped mRNA as a template. Thus, eIF4E2 is likely the cap-binding protein in a translation initiation complex. The same knockdown approach indicated that eIF4E1 is not required for translation in Giardia. Immunofluorescence assays showed wide distribution of both homologues in the cytoplasm. But eIF4E1 was also found concentrated and colocalized with the m(2,2,7)GpppN cap, 16S-like rRNA, and fibrillarin in the nucleolus-like structure in the nucleus. eIF4E1 depletion from Giardia did not affect mRNA splicing, but the protein was bound to Giardia small nuclear RNAs D and H known to have an m(2,2,7)GpppN cap, thus suggesting a novel function not yet observed among other eIF4Es in eukaryote.
yotic cap-binding proteins belonging to the eIF4E family are generally involved in mediating the recruitment of ribosomes to capped mRNA. We described previously a cap-binding protein (now called eIF4E1) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe that appears to have all of the usual structural and functional attributes of an eIF4E. We have now characterised a new type of cap-binding protein (eIF4E2) from this organism, which at the amino acid sequence level, is 52% identical and 59% similar to eIF4E1. eIF4E2 is not essential in S.pombe but has some novel properties that may be related to a special function in the cell. The ratio of eIF4E2:eIF4E1 in the cell shifts in favour of eIF4E2 at higher temperatures. Despite having all of the dorsal face amino acids that have so far been associated with eIF4G binding to eIF4E1, eIF4E2 binds the eIF4E-binding domain of S.pombe eIF4G &gt;10(2)-times weaker than eIF4E1 in vitro. The eIF4E2 cap-binding affinity is in the typical micromolar range. The results suggest that eIF4E2 is not active on the main pathway of translation initiation in fission yeast but might play a role in the adaptation strategy of this organism under specific growth conditions. Moreover, they provide insight into the molecular characteristics required for tight binding to eIF4.
 (At.EIF4E1 and At.EIF4E2) encoding, respectively, the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E of Arabidopsis thaliana were isolated by complementation of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae conditional mutant. The deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins are homologous to those from monocotyledonous plants, yeast and mammals. The corresponding genes were identified in YAC clones mapping to chromosome IV (At.EIF4E1) and to chromosome V (At.EIF4E2). The yeast strain complemented by At.EIF4E2 grew poorly compared with an isogenic strain expressing At.EIF4E1. Northern and in situ hybridization analysis show that both Arabidopsis At.EIF4E1 and At.EIF4E2 mRNAs are differentially accumulated in plant tissues. The At.EIF4E1 mRNA is expressed in all tissues except in the cells of the specialization zone of the roots; the At.EIF4E2 mRNA is particularly abundant in floral organs and in young developing tissues. This work further demonstrates an association between a high level of EIF4E mRNAs and cell proliferation and suggests that the plant eIF4E isoforms may have distinct functions in cell development and metabolis.
 eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) genes were isolated and characterized from placental and chromosome 4-specific genomic libraries. One of the genes (EIF4E1) contained six introns, but the other gene (EIF4E2) was intronless, flanked by Alu sequences and 14-base pair (bp) direct repeats, and terminated by a short poly(A) stretch, all characteristics of retrotransposons. Numerous additional intronless eIF4E pseudogenes were found, but unlike EIF4E2, all contained premature in-frame stop codons. The entire EIF4E1 gene spanned &gt;50 kilobase pairs. The coding regions of these two genes differed in four nucleotide residues, resulting in two amino acid differences in the predicted proteins. The promoter of EIF4E1 has been characterized previously. The putative promoter of EIF4E2 contained no TATA box but did contain a transcription initiator region (Inr) and numerous other sequence motifs characteristic of regulated promoters. EIF4E2 contained only two of the three polyadenylation signals present in EIF4E1. Evidence for transcription of both genes was obtained from primer extension, S1 mapping, ribonuclease protection, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments. Transcription was found to initiate 19 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon in the case of EIF4E1 and 80 bp in the case of EIF4E2. The two genes were differentially expressed in four human cell lines, Wish, Chang, K562, and HeL.
horylation of eIF4E1 at serine 209 by MNK1 or MNK2 has been shown to initiate oncogenic mRNA translation, a process that favours cancer development and maintenance. Here, we interrogate the MNK-eIF4E axis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and show a distinct distribution of MNK1 and MNK2 in germinal centre B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL. Despite displaying a differential distribution in GCB and ABC, both MNKs functionally complement each other to sustain cell survival. MNK inhibition ablates eIF4E1 phosphorylation and concurrently enhances eIF4E3 expression. Loss of MNK protein itself downregulates total eIF4E1 protein level by reducing eIF4E1 mRNA polysomal loading without affecting total mRNA level or stability. Enhanced eIF4E3 expression marginally suppresses eIF4E1-driven translation but exhibits a unique translatome that unveils a novel role for eIF4E3 in translation initiation. We propose that MNKs can modulate oncogenic translation by regulating eIF4E1-eIF4E3 levels and activity in DLBC.
, eIF4E translation initiation factors and their eIFiso4E isoforms are essential susceptibility factors for many RNA viruses, including potyviruses. Mutations altering these factors are a major source of resistance to the viruses. The eIF4E allelic series is associated with specific resistance spectra in crops such as Capsicum annum. Genetic evidence shows that potyviruses have a specific requirement for a given 4E isoform that depends on the host plant. For example, Tobacco etch virus (TEV) uses eIF4E1 to infect Capsicum annuum but uses eIFiso4E to infect Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we investigated how TEV exploits different translation initiation factor isoforms to infect these two plant specie.
entation system was set up in Arabidopsis to test the restoration of systemic infection by TEV. Using this system, Arabidopsis susceptibility to TEV was complemented with a susceptible pepper eIF4E1 allele but not with a resistant allele. Therefore, in Arabidopsis, TEV can use the pepper eIF4E1 instead of the endogenous eIFiso4E isoform so is able to switch between translation initiation factor 4E isoform to infect the same host. Moreover, we show that overexpressing the pepper eIF4E1 alleles is sufficient to make Arabidopsis susceptible to an otherwise incompatible TEV strain. Lastly, we show that the resistant eIF4E1 allele is similarly overcome by a resistance-breaking TEV strain as in pepper, confirming that this Arabidopsis TEV-susceptibility complementation system is allele-specifi.
 here a complementation system in Arabidopsis that makes it possible to assess the role of pepper pvr2-eIF4E alleles in susceptibility to TEV. Heterologous complementation experiments showed that the idiosyncratic properties of the 4E and iso4E proteins create a major checkpoint for viral infection of different hosts. This system could be used to screen natural or induced eIF4E alleles to find and study alleles of interest for plant breedin.
otes, eIF4E translation initiation factors are essential proteins encoded by a small multigene family. In plants, they are a major source of host plant resistance to potyviruses that require specific 4E factors to infect cells. Combining mutations in different eIF4E genes could be a way of broadening the spectrum of plant resistance to viruses. We attempted to combine null mutations affecting the two main Arabidopsis thaliana 4E factors eIF4E1 and eIFiso4E but discovered that this combination is lethal. Transmission through the male gametophyte is completely abolished in the eif4e1 eifiso4e double mutant. This shows that eIF4E1 and eIFiso4E are essential for male gametophyte development and act redundantly. These results may have implications for eIF4E-based pyramiding strategies to improve crop resistanc.
on to the canonical eIF4E cap-binding protein, eukaryotes have evolved sequence-related variants with distinct features, some of which have been shown to negatively regulate translation of particular mRNAs, but which remain poorly characterised. Mammalian eIF4E proteins have been divided into three classes, with class I representing the canonical cap-binding protein eIF4E1. eIF4E1 binds eIF4G to initiate translation, and other eIF4E-binding proteins such as 4E-BPs and 4E-T prevent this interaction by binding eIF4E1 with the same consensus sequence YX 4Lϕ. We investigate here the interaction of human eIF4E2 (4EHP), a class II eIF4E protein, which binds the cap weakly, with eIF4E-transporter protein, 4E-T. We first show that ratios of eIF4E1:4E-T range from 50:1 to 15:1 in HeLa and HEK293 cells respectively, while those of eIF4E2:4E-T vary from 6:1 to 3:1. We next provide evidence that eIF4E2 binds 4E-T in the yeast two hybrid assay, as well as in pull-down assays and by recruitment to P-bodies in mammalian cells. We also show that while both eIF4E1 and eIF4E2 bind 4E-T via the canonical YX 4Lϕ sequence, nearby downstream sequences also influence eIF4E:4E-T interactions. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to demonstrate that eIF4E2, normally homogeneously localised in the cytoplasm, does not redistribute to stress granules in arsenite-treated cells, nor to P-bodies in Actinomycin D-treated cells, in contrast to eIF4E1. Moreover, eIF4E2 shuttles through nuclei in a Crm1-dependent manner, but in an 4E-T-independent manner, also unlike eIF4E1. Altogether we conclude that while both cap-binding proteins interact with 4E-T, and can be recruited by 4E-T to P-bodies, eIF4E2 functions are likely to be distinct from those of eIF4E1, both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, further extending our understanding of mammalian class I and II cap-binding protein.
ed eukaryotic initiation factor-4E binding proteins (4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2) were recently characterized for their capacity to bind specifically to eIF4E and inhibit its function. Here, we determined the cDNA sequence, tissue distribution, genomic structure, and chromosome localization of murine and human 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2. Mouse 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 consist of 117 and 120 amino acids and exhibit 91. 5 and 95.0% identity, respectively, to their human homologues. 4E-BP1 mRNA is expressed in most tissues, but is most abundant in adipose tissue, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, while 4E-BP2 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed. The structures of the mouse 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 were determined. The 4E-BP1 gene consists of three exons and spans approximately 16 kb. In addition, two 4E-BP1 pseudogenes exist in the mouse genome. The 4E-BP2 gene spans approximately 20 kb and exhibits an identical genomic organization to that of 4E-BP1, with the protein coding portion of the gene divided into three exons. There are no pseudogenes for 4E-BP2. The chromosomal locations of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 were determined in both mice and humans by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Mouse 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 map to chromosomes 8 (A4-B1) and 10 (B4-B5), respectively, and human 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 localize to chromosomes 8p12 and 10q21-q22, respectivel.
y explored the effects of pantothenic acid (PA) on the immune and physical barrier function, and relative mRNA levels of signaling molecules in the gill of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). The results indicated that compared with optimal PA supplementation, PA deficiency (1.31&nbsp;mg/kg diet) decreased gill interleukin 10, transforming growth factor β1, inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), eIF4E-binding protein 2, Claudin b and ZO-1 mRNA levels; anti-superoxide anion activity, and activities and mRNA levels of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and NF-E2-related factor (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Additionally, PA deficiency and excess (75.08&nbsp;mg/kg diet) decreased gill complement 3 and glutathione contents, lysozyme and acid phosphatase, anti-hydroxy radical, catalase and glutathione S-transferases activities, and liver-expression antimicrobial peptide 2, hepcidin, Claudin 3, Claudin c and Occludin mRNA levels (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Conversely, PA deficiency increased gill reactive oxygen species and protein carbonyl contents, and interferon γ2, interleukin 8, nuclear factor kappa B P65, Claudin 15a, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1a and Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1b mRNA levels (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, PA deficiency and excess increased gill malondialdehyde content, and tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, IκB kinase α, IκB kinase β, IκB kinase γ, target of rapamycin and ribosomal S6 protein kinase1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and myosin light-chain kinase mRNA levels (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, PA deﬁciency decreased immune and physical barrier function, and regulated relative mRNA levels of signaling molecules in fish gill. Based on the quadratic regression analysis of gill lysozyme activity, the optimal PA levels in grass carp (253.44-745.25&nbsp;g) were estimated to be 36.97&nbsp;mg/kg die.
lant viruses encode elements at the 5' end of their RNAs that, unlike most cellular mRNAs, can initiate translation in the absence of a 5' m7GpppG cap. Here, we describe an exceptionally long (739 nt) leader sequence in Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV), a recently-emerged wheat pathogen that belongs to the Potyviridae family of positive-strand RNA viruses. We demonstrate that the TriMV 5' leader drives strong cap-independent translation in both wheat germ extract and oat protoplasts through a novel, non-canonical translation mechanism. Translation preferentially initiates at the 13(th) start codon within the leader sequence independently of eIF4E, but involves eIF4G. We truncated the 5' leader to a 300-nucleotide sequence that drives cap-independent translation from the 5' end. Within this sequence, we show that the translation activity relies on a stem loop structure identified at nucleotide position 469-490. The disruption of the stem significantly impairs the function of the 5' UTR in driving translation and competing against a capped RNA. Additionally, the TriMV 5' UTR can direct translation from an internal position of a bicistronic mRNA. And unlike cap-driven translation, it is unimpaired when the 5' end is blocked by a strong hairpin in a monocistronic reporter. However, the disruption of the identified stem structure eliminates such translational advantage. Our results reveal a potent and uniquely-controlled translation enhancer that may provide new insights into mechanisms of plant virus translational regulatio.
ers of the Potyviridae family rely on their 5' end for translation. Here, we show that the 739 nucleotide-long Triticum mosaic virus 5' leader bears a powerful translation element with features distinct from those described for other plant viruses. Despite the presence of twelve AUG start codons within the TriMV 5' UTR, translation primarily initiates at the 13(th) AUG codon. The TriMV 5' UTR is capable of driving cap-independent translation in vitro and in vivo, is independent of eIF4E, and can drive internal translation initiation. A hairpin structure at nucleotide position 469-490 is required for cap-independent translation and internal translation initiation abilities of the element, and plays a role in the ability of the TriMV UTR to compete against a capped RNA in vitro. Our results reveal a novel translation enhancer that may provide new insights into the large diversity among plant virus translation mechanism.
tissues, stem and progenitor cells must balance proliferation and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. How this is done is unclear. Here, we show that the DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX6 is necessary for maintaining adult progenitor cell function. DDX6 loss results in premature differentiation and decreased proliferation of epidermal progenitor cells. To maintain self-renewal, DDX6 associates with YBX1 to bind the stem loops found in the 3' UTRs of regulators of proliferation/self-renewal (CDK1, EZH2) and recruit them to EIF4E to facilitate their translation. To prevent premature differentiation&nbsp;of progenitor cells, DDX6 regulates the 5' UTR of differentiation inducing transcription factor, KLF4&nbsp;and degrades its transcripts through association with mRNA degradation proteins. Our results demonstrate that progenitor function is maintained by DDX6 complexes through two distinct pathways&nbsp;that include the degradation of differentiation-inducing transcripts and by promoting the translation of self-renewal and proliferation mRNA.
ion of protein synthesis is a common event in cancer. As MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks) play critical roles in regulation of protein synthesis, they have emerged as novel anti-cancer targets. Mnks phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and promote eIF4E-mediated oncogenic activity. Given that the kinase activity of Mnks is essential for oncogenesis but is dispensable for normal development, the discovery of potent and selective pharmacological Mnk inhibitors provides pharmacological target validation and offers a new strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, comprehensive in silico screening approaches were deployed, and three thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine and pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives were identified as hit compounds. Further chemical modification of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative 3 has given rise to a series of highly potent Mnk2 inhibitors that could be potential leads for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemi.
e the clinical significance of eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF4E) and mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR) expressions in esophageal squamous carcinoma tissue.
thological data and paraffin samples of resected tumor tissue from 148 patients with esophageal squamous carcinoma undergoing resection in our department between January 2010 and December 2012 were collected retrospectively. Expressions of eIF4E and mTOR were detected in above carcinoma tissues, counterpart para-carcinoma tissues (1 cm distance to carcinoma) and normal tissues (5 cm distance to carcinoma) with Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Their relevance with clinicopathological features was analyze.
n of mTOR located mainly in cytoplasm and elF4E mainly in cellular membrane, presenting as yellow grains. These two markers showed strong expression in carcinoma tissues and weak or none in para-carcinoma tissues. In esophageal squamous carcinoma tissues, counterpart para-carcinoma tissues and normal tissues, mTOR protein expression was 85.8%(127/148), 35.1%(52/148) and 3.4%(5/148), eIF4E protein expression was 93.9%(139/148), 35.1%(52/148) and 12.8%(19/148), with a downtrend respectively (all P&lt;0.05). Expressions of mTOR and eIF4E were associated with tumor invasion depth and lymphatic metastasis (all P&lt;0.05), while mTOR expression was associated with differentiation degree (P=0.003), but eIF4E expression was not. Both expressions were not associated with gender, age, and tumor size(all P&gt;0.05.
ns of eIF4E and mTOR are up-regulated in esophageal squamous carcinoma tissues, which may be associated with tumor malignance and lymphatic metastasis of esophageal squamous carcinoma. Combined detection of two markers may be helpful to predict the tumor malignance and the prognosis of patient.
ic activation of the mechanistic (mammalian) target of rapamycin in complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to excess nutrients contributes to obesity-associated pathologie.
tand the initial events that ultimately lead to obesity-associated pathologies, the present study assessed mTORC1 responses in the liver after a relatively short exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD.
sity-prone rats were meal-trained to consume either a control (CON; 10% of energy from fat) diet or an HFD (60% of energy from fat) for 2 wk. Livers were collected and analyzed for mTORC1 signaling [assessed by changes in phosphorylation of 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1)] and potential regulatory mechanisms, including changes in the association of Ras-related GTP binding (Rag) A and RagC with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and expression of Sestrin1, Sestrin2, and Sestrin.
nduced activation of mTORC1 was blunted in the livers of rats fed the HFD compared with those fed the CON diet (p70S6K1 phosphorylation, 19% of CON; 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, 61% of CON). The attenuated response was not due to a change in a kinase also referred to as protein kinase B (Akt) signaling but rather to resistance to amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1, as evidenced by a reduction in the interaction of RagA (69% of CON) and RagC (66% of CON) with mTOR and enhanced expression of the mTORC1 repressors Sestrin2 (132% of CON) and Sestrin3 (143% of CON). The consumption of an HFD led to impaired amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1 as assessed in livers perfused in situ with medium containing various concentrations of amino acid.
ults in rats support a model in which the initial response of the liver to an HFD is an attenuation of rather than the expected activation of mTORC1. The initial response likely represents a counterregulatory mechanism to the onset of excess nutrients and is caused by enhanced expression of Sestrin2 and Sestrin3, which, in turn, leads to impaired Rag signaling, resulting in resistance to amino acid-induced activation of mTORC.
 RNA is recruited to the eukaryotic ribosome by a complex including the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E (the cap-binding protein), the scaffold protein eIF4G and the RNA helicase eIF4A. To shut-off host-cell protein synthesis, eIF4G is cleaved during picornaviral infection by a virally encoded proteinase; the structural basis of this reaction and its stimulation by eIF4E is unclear. We have structurally and biochemically investigated the interaction of purified foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader proteinase (Lb(pro) ), human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) 2A proteinase (2A(pro) ) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) 2A(pro) with purified eIF4GII, eIF4E and the eIF4GII/eIF4E complex. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we completed (13) C/(15) N sequential backbone assignment of human eIF4GII residues 551-745 and examined their binding to murine eIF4E. eIF4GII551-745 is intrinsically unstructured and remains so when bound to eIF4E. NMR and biophysical techniques for determining stoichiometry and binding constants revealed that the papain-like Lb(pro) only forms a stable complex with eIF4GII551-745 in the presence of eIF4E, with KD values in the low nanomolar range; Lb(pro) contacts both eIF4GII and eIF4E. Furthermore, the unrelated chymotrypsin-like 2A(pro) from HRV2 and CVB4 also build a stable complex with eIF4GII/eIF4E, but with KD values in the low micromolar range. The HRV2 enzyme also forms a stable complex with eIF4E; however, none of the proteinases tested complex stably with eIF4GII alone. Thus, these three picornaviral proteinases have independently evolved to establish distinct triangular heterotrimeric protein complexes that may actively target ribosomes involved in mRNA recruitment to ensure efficient host cell shut-of.
g breast cancer will require the development of targeted strategies that can effectively block disease progression. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are effective in addressing estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer development, but estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer remains an unmet challenge due to gaps in pathobiological understanding. In this study, we used reverse phase protein array (RPPA) to identify activation of Src kinase as an early signaling alteration in premalignant breast lesions of women who did not respond to tamoxifen, a widely used ER antagonist for hormonal therapy of breast cancer. Src kinase blockade with the small molecule inhibitor saracatinib prevented the disorganized 3D growth of ER- mammary epithelial cells in vitro and delayed the development of pre-malignant lesions and tumors in vivo in mouse models developing HER2+ and ER- mammary tumors, extending tumor-free and overall survival. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Src blockade reduced glucose metabolism as a result of an inhibition in ERK1/2-MNK1-eIF4E-mediated cap-dependent translation of c-Myc and transcription of the glucose transporter GLUT1, thereby limiting energy available for cell growth. Taken together, our results provide a sound rationale to target Src pathways in premalignant breast lesions to limit the development of breast cancer.
prolin (TTP) regulates the expression of AU-rich element-containing mRNAs through promoting the degradation and repressing the translation of target mRNA. While the mechanism for promoting target mRNA degradation has been extensively studied, the mechanism underlying translational repression is not well established. Here we show that TTP recruits eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E2 to repress target mRNA translation. TTP interacted with eIF4E2 but not with eIF4E. Overexpression of eIF4E2 enhanced TTP-mediated translational repression, and downregulation of endogenous eIF4E2 or overexpression of a truncation mutant of eIF4E2 impaired TTP-mediated translational repression. Overexpression of an eIF4E2 mutant that lost the cap-binding activity also impaired TTP's activity, suggesting that the cap-binding activity of eIF4E2 is important in TTP-mediated translational repression. We further show that TTP promoted eIF4E2 binding to target mRNA. These results implicate that TTP recruits eIF4E2 to compete with eIF4E to repress the translation of target mRNA. This notion is supported by that downregulation of endogenous eIF4E2 increased the production of TNF-alpha protein without affecting the mRNA levels in THP-1 cells. Collectively, these results uncover a novel mechanism by which TTP represses target mRNA translatio.
 (Saccharum sp. hybrid) provides the main source of sugar for humans. Sugarcane mosaic disease (SMD) is a major threat to sugarcane production. Currently, control of SMD is mainly dependent on breeding resistant cultivars through hybridization, which is time-consuming. Understanding the mechanism of viral infection may facilitate novel strategies to breed cultivars resistant to SMD and to control the disease. In this study, a wide interaction was detected between the viral VPg protein and host proteins. Several genes were screened from sugarcane cDNA library that could interact with Sugarcane streak mosaic virus VPg, including SceIF4E1 and ScELC. ScELC was predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein, but subcellular localization analysis showed it was distributed both in cytoplasmic and nuclear, and interactions were also detected between ScELC and VPg of SCMV or SrMV that reveal ScELC was widely used in the SMD pathogen infection process. ScELC and VPgs interacted in the nucleus, and may function to enhance the viral transcription rate. ScELC also interacted with SceIF4E2 both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, but not with SceIF4E1 and SceIF4E3. These results suggest that ScELC may be essential for the function of SceIF4E2, an isomer of eIF4.
y, the production of new proteins in undetermined cells pushes them to new fates. Other proteins hold a stem cell in a mode of self-renewal. In germ cells, these decision-making proteins are produced largely from translational control of preexisting mRNAs. To date, all of the regulation has been attributed to RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that repress mRNAs in many models of germ cell development (Drosophila, mouse, C. elegans, and Xenopus). In this review, we focus on the selective, positive function of translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G, which recruit mRNAs to ribosomes upon derepression. Evidence now shows that the two events are not separate but rather are coordinated through composite complexes of repressors and germ cell isoforms of eIF4 factors. Strikingly, the initiation factor isoforms are themselves mRNA selective. The mRNP complexes of translation factors and RBPs are built on specific populations of mRNAs to prime them for subsequent translation initiation. Simple rearrangement of the partners causes a dormant mRNP to become synthetically active in germ cells when and where they are required to support gametogenesi.
 target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling serves as a central regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival by interacting with various proteins. To date, few studies implicated mTOR in placenta. Human placenta in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) shows several alterations including villous immaturity, impaired placental function, and overgrowth. Hence, we aimed to investigate the expression of mTOR, phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR), and the 2 phosphorylated downstream targets of mTOR, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p-p70S6K), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (p-4EBP1) in normal term and gestational diabetic human placentas. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed with antibodies against mTOR, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, and p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in normal and diabetic placentas (n = 6 each) and quantified by ImageJ. All mTOR pathway components that we studied were immunolocalized in both normal and diabetic placenta groups. Syncytiotrophoblast and the vascular wall in villi displayed cytoplasmic mTOR and p-mTOR (S2448) immunoreactivities in all placenta samples. However, increased expression of p70S6K in syncytiotrophoblast and p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in villous stromal cells was observed in gestational diabetic placentas. Western blot analysis also confirmed the statistically significant increase in p-p70S6K (T389) expression in diabetic placentas. The altered expression of downstream components of mTOR signaling in gestational diabetic placentas suggests an involvement of mTOR activity in the placental pathology of GDM. However, whether increased nutrient transport via this pathway will stimulate fetal and placental overgrowth is still unknown. Although this is a descriptive study, further studies with a functional analysis to highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying this placental pathology are propose.
l nutrient intake represents a limiting factor for growth and long-term survival of low-birth weight infants. The objective of this study was to determine if in neonates who can consume only 70&nbsp;% of their protein and energy requirements for 8 days, enteral leucine supplementation will upregulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in skeletal muscle, leading to an increase in protein synthesis and muscle anabolism. Nineteen 4-day-old piglets were fed by gastric tube 1 of 3 diets, containing (kg body weight(-1)·day(-1)) 16&nbsp;g protein and 190&nbsp;kcal (CON), 10.9&nbsp;g protein and 132&nbsp;kcal (R), or 10.8&nbsp;g protein&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.2&nbsp;% leucine and 136&nbsp;kcal (RL) at 4-h intervals for 8 days. On day 8, plasma AA and insulin levels were measured during 6 post-feeding intervals, and muscle protein synthesis rate and mTOR signaling proteins were determined at 120&nbsp;min post-feeding. At 120&nbsp;min, leucine was highest in RL (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001), whereas insulin, isoleucine and valine were lower in RL and R compared to CON (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001). Compared to RL and R, the CON diet increased (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01) body weight, protein synthesis, phosphorylation of S6 kinase (p-S6K1) and 4E-binding protein (p-4EBP1), and activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4 complex (eIF4E·eIF4G). RL increased (P&nbsp;≤&nbsp;0.01) p-S6K1, p-4EBP1 and eIF4E·eIF4G compared to R. In conclusion, when protein and energy intakes are restricted for 8 days, leucine supplementation increases muscle mTOR activation, but does not improve body weight gain or enhance skeletal muscle protein synthesis in neonatal pig.
ing the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base, we identified partial cDNA sequences potentially encoding a novel human CC chemokine. We determined the entire cDNA sequence which encodes a highly basic polypeptide of 134 amino acids total with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids. The predicted mature protein of 111 amino acids has the four canonical cysteine residues and shows 21-33% identity to other human CC chemokines, but has a unique carboxyl-terminal extension of about 30 amino acids which contains two extra cysteine residues. The mRNA was expressed strongly in tissues such as the lymph nodes, Appendix, and spleen. The recombinant protein, which was produced by the baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity, was a highly efficient chemoattractant for certain human T cell lines and a highly potent one for freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured normal T cells expanded by phytohemagglutinin and interleukin 2. Unlike most other CC chemokines, however, this novel chemokine was not chemotactic for monocytes or neutrophils, suggesting that it is specific for lymphocytes. From these results, we designated this novel CC chemokine as SLC from secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine. SLC fused with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SLC-SEAP) was used to characterize the SLC receptor. Binding of SLC-SEAP to freshly isolated lymphocytes was blocked by SLC (IC50, 0.12 nM) but not by any other CC chemokine so far tested, suggesting that resting lymphocytes express a class of receptors highly specific for SLC. By using somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, and selected yeast and bacterial artificial chromosome clones, we mapped the SLC gene (SCYA21) at chromosome 9p13 and between chromosomal markers, D9S1978(WI-8765) and AFM326vd1, where the gene for another novel CC chemokine termed ELC from EBI1-ligand chemokine (SCYA19) also exists. Collectively, SLC is a novel CC chemokine specific for lymphocytes and, together with ELC, constitutes a new group of chemokines localized at chromosome 9p1.
al product that alters the mucosal environment and impairs the immune barrier increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections, especially HIV infection, which thrives on mucosal damage and inflammation. The FDA-recommended rabbit vaginal irritation (RVI) model serves as a first line selection tool for vaginal products; however, for decades it has been limited to histopathology scoring, insufficient to select safe anti-HIV microbicides. In this study we incorporate to the RVI model a novel quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA) to quantify mRNA levels of 25 genes representing leukocyte differentiation markers, toll-like receptors (TLR), cytokines, chemokines, epithelial repair, microbicidal and vascular markers, by designing two multiplex arrays. Tissue sections were obtained from 36 rabbits (6 per treatment arm) after 14 daily applications of a placebo gel, saline, 4% nonoxynol-9 (N-9), and three combinations of the anti-HIV microbicides tenofovir (TFV) and UC781 in escalating concentrations (highest: 10% TFV+2.5%UC781). Results showed that increased expression levels of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, interleukin (IL)-1β, CXCL8, epithelial membrane protein (EMP)-1 (P&lt;0.05), and decreased levels of TLR2 (P&lt;0.05), TLR3 and bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) (P&lt;0.001) were associated with cervicovaginal mucosal alteration (histopathology). Seven markers showed a significant linear trend predicting epithelial damage (up with CD4, IL-1β, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL21, EMP1 and down with BPI). Despite the low tissue damage RVI scores, the high-dose microbicide combination gel caused activation of HIV host cells (SLC and CD4) while N-9 caused proinflammatory gene upregulation (IL-8 and TLR4) suggesting a potential for increasing risk of HIV via different mechanisms depending on the chemical nature of the test produc.
 lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC/CCL21), one of the CC chemokines, exerts potent antitumor immunity by co-localizing T cells and dendritic cells at the tumor site and is currently tested against human solid tumors. Here, we investigated whether the combination of recombinant adenovirus encoding murine CCL21 (Ad-mCCL21) with low-dose paclitaxel would improve therapeutic efficacy against murine cancer. Immunocompetent mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma or 4T1 breast carcinoma were treated with either Ad-mCCL21, paclitaxel, or both agents together. Our results showed that Ad-mCCL21 + low-dose paclitaxel more effectively reduced the growth of tumors as compared with either treatment alone and significantly prolonged survival time of the tumor-bearing animals. These antitumor effects of the combined therapy were linked to altered cytokine network at the tumor site, enhanced apoptosis of tumor cells, and decreased formation of new vessels in tumors. Importantly, the combined therapy elicited a strong therapeutic antitumor immunity, which could be partly abrogated by the depletion of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Collectively, these preclinical evaluations may provide a combined strategy for antitumor immunity and should be considered for testing in clinical trial.
 lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC/CCL21) and its receptor CCR7 have been implicated in lymph node metastasis, whereas the mechanism of which remains unclear. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in invasion and migration of cancer cells. We presumed that CCL21/CCR7 axis activates EMT process to induce cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Firstly, the expressions of CCR7 and EMT markers were examined by immunohistochemical staining in the primary breast carcinoma tissues from 60 patients who underwent radical mastectomy. Then, we investigated whether CCL21/CCR7 induces EMT process during mediating cancer cell invasion or migration in vitro. By immunohistolochemistry, high expressions of CCR7, Slug and N-cadherin were seen in 60, 65, and 76.67 % of tumors, respectively, and significantly associated with lymph node metastases as well as clinical pathological stage. Furthermore, the CCR7 expression was significantly correlated to Slug and N-cadherin. In vitro, stimulating breast cancer cell lines 1428, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 with CCL21, the invasion and migration of tumor cells were promoted, and simultaneously, EMT phenotype of tumor cells was enhanced, including down-regulation of E-cadherin, up-regulation of Slug, Vimentin and N-cadherin at both protein and mRNA levels. Inversely, knockdown of CCR7 by shRNA suppressed tumor cell invasion, migration and EMT phenotype induced by CCL21. These results indicated that CCL21/CCR7 axis could activate EMT process during chemotaxis of breast carcinoma cell.
ine receptor 7 (CCR7), a known lymph node homing receptor for immune cells, has been reported as a key molecule in lymph node metastasis. We hypothesized a clinicopathological correlation and functional causality between CCR7 expression and lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC.
med immunohistochemical analysis of 105 consecutive and 61 exclusive pathological T1 ESCC patients, followed by adhesion assay and in vivo experiment using a newly developed lymph node metastasis mouse model. The adhesive ability in response to CC-chemokine ligand 21/secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (CCL21/SLC) was assessed in the presence or absence of lymphatic endothelial cells and anti-CCR7 antibody. We established a heterotopic transplantation mouse model and analyzed lymph node metastasis by quantitative real-time RT-PC.
CCR7 expression in immunohistochemistory was detected in 28 (27%) of 105 consecutive patients and 17 (28%) of 61 T1 patients, which significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.037 and p = 0.040, respectively) and poor five-year survival (p = 0.013 and p = 0.012, respectively). Adhesion assay revealed an enhanced adhesive ability of CCR7-expressing cells in response to CCL21/SLC, in particular, in the presence of lymphatic endothelial cells (p = 0.005). In the mouse model, lymph nodes from mice transplanted with CCR7-expressing cells showed significantly higher DNA levels at 5 weeks (p = 0.019), indicating a high metastatic potential of CCR7-expressing cell.
ults demonstrated the significant clinicopathological relationship and functional causality between CCR7 expression and lymph node metastasis in ESCC patient.
abetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing β cells in the pancreatic islets. The migration of T cells from blood vessels into pancreas is critical for the development of islet inflammation and β cell destruction in T1D. To define the roles of C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) in recruitment of T cells into islets, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate tissue from inflamed islets of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and uninflamed islets of BALB/c and young NOD mice. RT-PCR analyses detected mRNAs for CCR7 and its chemokine ligands CCL19 (ELC; MIP-3β) and CCL21 (SLC) in captures from inflamed, but not from uninflamed, islets. Immunohistology studies revealed that high endothelial venules in inflamed islets co-express CCL21 protein and MAdCAM-1 (an adhesion molecule that recruits lymphocytes into islets). Desensitization of lymphocyte CCR7 blocked about 75 % of T cell migration from the bloodstream into inflamed islets, but had no effect on B cell migration into islets. These results indicate that CCR7 and its ligands are important in the recruitment of T cells into inflamed islets and thus in the pathogenesis of T1.
tial use of lymphoid chemokines to generate a dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccine is not yet clear. We investigated the effect of lymphoid chemokines on DC function and on the production of effective cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for application of cancer vaccine using monocyte-derived mature DCs (mDCs) prestimulated with lymphoid chemokines. mDCs exposed to a secondary lymphoid organ chemokine (SLC/CCL21) dramatically induced CTL response by increasing cytolytic activity without any significant alterations on expression of cell surface markers (e.g. CD80, CD83, CD86 and CCR7) or on the production of cytokines (e.g. IL-12p70, IL-10 and IL-23). Interestingly, mDCs prestimulated with CCL21 showed higher levels of CXCL10 (IP-10) production, but not the production of CCL22, compared with untreated mDCs. IP-10 treatment during CTL generation with DCs dramatically enhanced tumour-specific CTL response compared with untreated CTLs, and these enhanced CTL-inducing functions of CCL21-treated DCs were inhibited by anti-IP-10 treatment. Taken together, our data suggested an important role of the lymphoid-endothelium-associated chemokine, CCL21, on DCs in the induction of CTL response.
 lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) is a key CC chemokine for chemotaxis of immune cells and has been an attractive candidate for anti-tumor treatments. However, among the immune cells recruited by SLC to tumors, the CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) compromise the anti-tumor effects. In this study, we proposed the combination therapy of intratumoral co-administration of SLC and anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We hypothesized that the intratumoral injections of SLC and depletion of Tregs would have stronger inhibition effects on the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mic.
ice were inoculated subcutaneously with the murine HCC cell line, and mice with visible tumors were treated intratumorally with SLC, SLC plus anti-CD25 mAbs or the control antibodies. The percentages of Tregs, effector CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were checked in the tumors, lymph nodes, spleen and liver at regular intervals. The levels of intratumoral IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β1 were evaluated. The final anti-tumor effects were measured by the tumor volume and weight as well as the intratumoral activity of MMP2 and MMP9. Bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells were used to explore the mechanisms of maturation induced by SLC in vitr.
iments showed the combination therapy significantly decreased the frequency of Tregs, and increased CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells at tumor sites. These alterations were accompanied by an increased level of IL-12 and IFN-γ, and decreased level of IL-10 and TGF-β1. Unexpectedly, we observed a significantly decreased percentage of Tregs, and increased CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in the lymph nodes, spleen and liver after the combination therapy. The growth and invasiveness of HCC was also maximally inhibited in the combination therapy compared with the SLC alone. Furthermore, we confirmed SLC induced the maturation of DCs via NF-κB p65 and this maturation would benefit the combination therap.
demonstrated that intratumoral co-administration of SLC and anti-CD25 mAbs was an effective treatment for HCC, which was correlated with the altered tumor microenvironment and systemically optimized percentages of Tregs, CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in peripheral immune organ.
e the anti-tumor effect and immune mechanism mediated by a new recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) encoding secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) mature peptide gene. AAV Helper-Free system was used for rAAV-SLC package. The anti-tumor effect of SLC was detected by bearing tumor established from Hepal-6 cells both in C57BL/6J and nude mice. Flow cytometry analysis and IHC for Tumor-infiltrating T cells and CD11c+DCs were also investigated to explore the immunological mechanism. rAAV-SLC was successfully packaged in AAV293 cells and transfected Hepal-6 tumor cells at high efficiency. The anti-tumor effect was demonstrated by less tumor weight and longer survival outcome. Coincident with the anti-tumor response, local elaboration of SLC within the tumor bed elicited a heavy infiltration of CD4+, CD8+T cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells into the tumor sites. More importantly, there was higher infiltration of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Local elaboration of SLC mediated by rAAV-SLC has strong T cell mediated anti-tumor effect. The study also suggested that Tregs in the tumor microenvironment tampered the anti-tumor effec.
er remains a challenging health problem with more than 1.1 million deaths worldwide annually. With current therapy, the long term survival for the majority of lung cancer patients remains low, thus new therapeutic strategies are needed. One such strategy would be to develop immune therapy for lung cancer. Immune approaches remain attractive because although surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy alone or in combination produce response rates in all histological types of lung cancer, relapse is frequent. Strategies that harness the immune system to react against tumors can be integrated with existing forms of therapy for optimal responses toward this devastating disease. Both antigen presenting cell (APC) and T cell activities are reduced in the lung tumor microenvironment. In this review we discuss our experience with efforts to restore host APC and T cell activities in the lung cancer microenvironment by intratumoral administration of dendritic cells (DC) expressing the CCR7 receptor ligand CCL21 (secondary lymphoid chemokine, SLC). Based on the results demonstrating that CCL21 is an effective anti cancer agent in the pre-clinical lung tumor model systems, a phase I clinical trial was initiated using intratumoral injection of CCL21 gene modified autologous DC in lung cancer. Results from the trial thus far indicate tolerability, immune enhancement and tumor shrinkage via this approac.
 cells (DCs) are potent professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with the ability to prime naïve T cells, and play an important role in the initiation and regulation of immune responses. In this study, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus carrying the SLC gene (Ad-SLC), and detected the biological effects of Ad-SLC-modified DCs as an adjuvant for the initiation of gastric cancer immune responses. Human DCs were transfected with Ad-SLC and the recombinant adenovirus carrying the β-galactosidase gene, Ad-LacZ, respectively. Modified DCs were pulsed with the cell lysate antigen of SGC-7901 cells (a type of gastric cancer cell line) and co-cultured with autologous T cells. The T cells were harvested and incubated with SGC-7901 cells and the cytotoxic function of the T cells was detected. Based on the data, the expression of mature DC phenotypes CD83 and CCR7 was upregulated after transfection with Ad-SLC and the chemotaxis function of DCs was augmented after transfection with Ad-SLC. Moreover, the expression of RANTES in DCs was upregulated by Ad-SLC transfection, while expression levels of IL-12p70 and IL-10 were not significantly altered. When co-cultured with autologous T cells, DCs modified with the SLC gene and pulsed with SGC-7901 cell lysates significantly promoted the proliferation of autologous T cells and induced Th1 differentiation, and displayed a strong cytotoxicity to SGC-7901 cells. In conclusion, Ad-SLC promoted DC maturation, enhancing the ability of DCs for T-cell chemotaxis and T-cell stimulation, and induced specific anti-gastric cancer cellular immunity. Recombinant Ad-SLC-modified DCs may be used as an adjuvant to induce an effective anti-gastric cancer immune respons.
s are a family of small, secreted proteins that function in leukocyte and tumor cell trafficking and recruiting. CC chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21)/secondary lymphoid chemokine (SLC) belongs to the inflammatory subgroup of chemokines and is expressed by stromal cells in the T-cell-rich zones of peripheral lymph nodes, afferent lymphatic endothelial cells and high endothelial venules. CCR7 (both in human and mouse) and CXCR3 (in mouse) are expressed by the most potent antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells), naïve/central memory, and effector T cells, respectively. Inflammation in the skin can induce expression of CCL21 which is subsequently drained into loco-regional lymph nodes responsible for co-localization of antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes, a prerequisite for induction of adaptive immune responses. Here, skin functions as a remote control for induction of targeted cell migration in vivo. This chapter describes Gene Gun administration of plasmid DNA expressing functionally active CCL21 (as an example of a chemokine) into the skin in mice and subsequent functional evaluation of the transgene expression in viv.
n functions as an important adhesion molecule that mediates tethering and rolling of lymphocytes by binding to high endothelial venule (HEV)-expressed ligands during recirculation. Subsequent lymphocyte arrest and transmigration require activation through binding of HEV-decorated homeostatic chemokines such as secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC; CCL21) to its counterreceptor, CCR7. Importantly, L-selectin also functions as a signaling molecule. In this study, signaling induced by ligation of L-selectin using mAb or endothelial cell-expressed ligand significantly enhanced the chemotaxis of murine T cells and B cells to SLC but not to other homeostatic chemokines. Consistent with the expression levels of L-selectin in different lymphocyte subsets, L-selectin-mediated enhancement of chemotaxis to SLC was observed for all naive lymphocytes and effector/memory CD8(+) T cells, whereas only a subpopulation of effector/memory CD4(+) T cells responded. During in vivo mesenteric lymph node migration assays, the absence of L-selectin on lymphocytes significantly attenuated both their ability to migrate out of the HEV and their chemotaxis away from the vessel wall. Notably, ligation of L-selectin and/or CCR7 did not result in increased CCR7 expression levels, internalization, or re-expression. Pharmacologic inhibitor studies showed that L-selectin-mediated enhanced chemotaxis to SLC required intact intracellular kinase function. Furthermore, treatment of lymphocytes with the spleen tyrosine kinase family inhibitor piceatannol reduced their ability to migrate across the HEV in peripheral lymph nodes. Therefore, these results suggest that &quot;cross-talk&quot; in the signaling pathways initiated by L-selectin and CCR7 provides a novel mechanism for functional synergy between these two molecules during lymphocyte migratio.
 lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC), which is expressed in T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes, strongly recruits both T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells. As appropriate interaction of tumor-specific T cells and mature dendritic cells, equipped with tumor antigens, is a prerequisite for effective T cell immunity against established tumors, we mobilized lymphocytes and dendritic cells to tumor sites by intratumoral injection of secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine-Fc (SLC-Fc) fusion protein using the B16F10 murine melanoma model. Activation of dendritic cells, another prerequisite for the effective activation of naïve tumor-specific T cells, was achieved by the addition of immunostimulatory cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) into the tumor site. Intratumoral administration of SLC-Fc or CpG-ODN revealed antitumor effects against B16F10 murine melanoma grown in the subcutaneous space. Co-treatment of SLC-Fc and CpG-ODN displayed synergistic effects in reducing the tumor size. The synergistic antitumor effect in co-treatment group was correlated with the synergistic/additive increase in the infiltration of CD4(+) T cells and CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the tumor mass compared to the single treatment groups. These results suggest that the combined use of chemokines and adjuvant molecules may be a possible strategy in clinical tumor immunotherap.
 lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC/CCL21) is a CC chemokine that is constitutively expressed in various lymphoid tissues and binds to chemokine receptor CCR7 on mature dendritic cells (DCs) and distinct T-and B-cell sub-populations. In vivo, CCL21 regulates the encounters between DC and T cells and thus is a key regulator of adaptive immune responses. We asked whether CCL21 is able to augment immunogenicity of a DNA-based vaccine against Her2/neu in a Balb/c mouse model with syngeneic Her2/neu+ tumor cells (D2F2/E2). Mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with plasmid DNA (pDNA) on day 1 and boosted on day 15; tumor challenge was performed subcutaneously on day 25. Coexpression of CCL21 and Her-2/neu resulted in induction of a TH1-polarized immune response and substantial improvement of the protective effect of the DNA vaccine. Coexpression of tumor antigen pDNA(Her2/neu) with both pDNA(GM-CSF) and pDNA(CCL21) as adjuvants led to further improvement of protection by the vaccine (70% tumor-free mice on day 35 vs 40% with either adjuvant alone vs 5-10% with tumor antigen alone). Our results show that CCL21 is a potent adjuvant for DNA vaccination, particularly in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Clinical use of a pDNA(Her2/neu/CCL21/GM-CSF) vaccine might be particularly promising in minimal residual Her2/neu+ breast cance.
 cell (DC)-based cancer immunotherapy requires an immunogenic tumor associated antigen (TAA) and an effective strategy for its presentation to lymphocytes. Here, we explored whether transduction of DCs with lentiviruses (LVs) expressing a fusion protein of secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) and mucin 1 (MUC1) could stimulate antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to human cancer cells in vitr.
eripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs were transduced with recombinant lentiviruses LV at different multiplicities of infection (MOI), and MUC1, SLC or SLC-MUC1 mRNA and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Transduction efficiencies and phenotypes of DCs were evaluated by flow cytometry. Induction of T lymphocyte proliferation by DCs was examined with a Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8). CTL activities against tumor cells were analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay.
pression of MUC1, SLC and SLC-MUC1 was obtained in DCs transduced with recombinant LVs, and the transduction efficiencies were dose-dependent. Transduction with LVs did not appreciably change the DC phenotype. CTL induced by LV MUC1 DCs potently and specifically lysed the HLA-A2+, MUC1+colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Moreover, this cytolytic activity against HCT-116 was enhanced with CTL stimulated by LV SLC-MUC1 DC.
duced with MUC1 could induce effective cytolytic activity against tumor cells in an antigen-specific and HLA-restricted fashion in vitro, and SLC promoted MUC1-specific anti-tumor activity. The transduction of DCs with LV SLC- MUC1 may be a promising strategy in DC-based cancer immunotherap.
iller (NK) cells represent a major subpopulation of lymphocytes. These cells have effector functions as they recognize and kill transformed cells as well as microbially infected cells. In addition, alloreactive NK cells have been successfully used to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemia and other hematological malignancies. NK cells are also endowed with immunoregulatory functions since they secrete cytokines such as IFN-γ, which favor the development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and chemokines such as CCL3/MIP-1α and CCL4/MIP-1β, which recruit various inflammatory cells into sites of inflammation. In human blood, NK cells are divided into CD56(bright) CD16(dim) and CD56(dim) CD16(bright) subsets. These subsets have different phenotypic expression and may have different functions; the former subset is more immunoregulatory and the latter is more cytolytic. The CD56(bright)CD16(dim) NK cells home into tissues such as the peripheral lymph nodes (LNs) under physiological conditions because they express the LN homing receptor CCR7 and they respond to CCL19/MIP-3β and CCL21/SLC chemokines. They also distribute into adenoid tissues or decidual uterus following the CXCR3/CXCL10 or CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. On the other hand, both NK cell subsets migrate into inflammatory sites, with more CD56(dim)CD16(bright) NK cells distributing into inflamed liver and lungs. CCR5/CCL5 axis plays an important role in the accumulation of NK cells in virally infected sites as well as during parasitic infections. CD56(bright)CD16(dim) cells also migrate into autoimmune sites such as inflamed synovial fluids in patients having rheumatoid arthritis facilitated by the CCR5/CCL3/CCL4/CCL5 axis, whereas they distribute into inflamed brains aided by the CX₃CR1/CX₃CL1 axis. On the other hand, CD56(dim)CD16(bright) NK cells accumulate in the liver of patients with primary biliary disease aided by the CXCR1/CXCL8 axis. However, the types of chemokines that contribute to their accumulation in target organs during graft vs. host (GvH) disease are not known. Further, chemokines activate NK cells to become highly cytolytic cells known as CC chemokine-activated killer (CHAK) cells that kill tumor cells. In summary, chemokines whether secreted in an autocrine or paracrine fashion regulate various biological functions of NK cells. Depending on the tissue and the chemokine secreted, NK cells may ameliorate the disease such as their roles in combating tumors or virally infected cells, and their therapeutic potentials in treating leukemias and other hematological malignancies, as well as reducing the incidence of GvH disease. In contrast, they may exacerbate the disease by damaging the affected tissues through direct cytotoxicity or by the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Examples are their deleterious roles in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosi.
f this study was to investigate whether dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with human secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (hSLC) and human interleukin-2 (hIL-2) genes are capable of improving DC's proliferation and to produce a marked antitumor effect in vitro combined with T-lymphocyte (TC.
primer was designed based on the corresponding gene sequence in GenBank. The Kpn I site was introduced into the upstream of the primer and Xho I site into the downstream. The SLC gene was amplified with the template of pET32a(+)-SLC by polymerase chain reaction. SLC was cloned into pBudCE4.1/IL-2 (TRAIL was cut from pBudCE4.1/TRAIL- IL-2 before) to construct recombinant plasmid pBudCE4.1/SLC-IL-2(PSI). DCs were transfected with pBudCE4.1/SLC-IL-2 by gene electric transfection. Protein expression was determined with Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cytotoxicity of TC and DC against the human bladder tumor cell were examined by chromium release assay. Flow cytometric analyses were performed to determine the apoptosis of tumor cells and the percentage of Tre.
vel of expression of SLC and IL-2 was observed in DCs transfected with SLC and IL-2 genes. The mean production of IL-2 was 19.8 +/- 2.5, 511.10 +/- 52.36, and 541.3 +/- 62.04 ng/10(6) cells/24 hours in the DC/vector, DC/IL-2, and DC/SLC-IL-2, respectively. The mean SLC production was 29.8 +/- 4.43, 506.10 +/- 42.36, and 567.34 +/- 52.05 ngs/10(6)cells/24 hours in the DC/ vector, DC/SLC, and DC/SLC-IL-2, respectively. Cytotoxicity to bladder cancer cells was increased. The mean cytotoxicity (the effector/target ratio, 40:1) of TC-DC/parental, TC-DC/IL-2, TC-DC/SLC, and TC-DC/SLC-IL-2(TDSI) to the human bladder cancer cells was 32.1 +/- 5.5%, 63.5 +/- 6.6%, 78.1 +/- 9.63%, respectively. The apoptotsis rate of bladder cancer cells treated with TDSI was 18.6% by flow cytometry. Treg cells' percentage was very small in the DC mediu.
L-2 were produced by autocrine in DCs transfected with SLC and IL-2 genes. DC/SLC-IL-2 can promote DC proliferation, while TC-DC/SLC-IL-2 and TC-DC/SLC could strongly enhance significant cytotoxicity against bladder cancer cell that was induced by the coculture of DCs (transfected with SLC and IL-2) and T.
leads from our recent animal studies, we are embarking on a series of new clinical trials to evaluate potential improvements in dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines for melanoma and pancreatic cancer. The first new strategy involves the use of a powerful chemokine (denoted secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine; SLC/CCL-21), which can both create functioning lymph node-like structures at sites of vaccination with tumor-loaded DCs and dramatically enhance vaccine efficacy in animal tumor models. Using this strategy, we are embarking on a clinical trial in melanoma patients with the intent to create functioning, ectopic, lymph node-like structures to enhance host antitumor immunity. The second strategy, in the setting of pancreatic cancer, involves a gene therapy and immunotherapy combination of a locally administered tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene vector followed by radiation (to induce tumor apoptosis/necrosis) and intratumorally administered monocyte-derived DCs (to uptake and present antigens from dying tumor cells to elicit potent, systemic, antitumor immunity.

rats were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: model group undergoing dripping of 40% acetone solution of dinitro-chlorobenzene (DNCB) on the back for 2 weeks and then enema of 6% DNCB acetone solution so as to establish models of UC, and then intravenous injection of normal saline (NS) for 5 days; SLC antibody intervention group undergoing intravenous injection of SLC antibody 15 microg x ml(-1) x kg(-1) immediately after the establishing of model; and control group undergoing enema of NS nly and then intravenous injection of NS for 5 days. Six days after the establishing of model venous blood samples were collected from the portal veins of the 3 groups. Lymphocytes were isolated and cultured. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of the SLC receptor CCR7. Boyden chamber system was used to examine the migration ability of the lymphocytes exposed to SLC of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ng/ml respectively. ELISA was used to detect the expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma in the supernatants of the lymphocytes of different group.
owed that the CCR7 mRNA expression level of the model group was (0.792 +/- 0.108), significantly higher than that of the intervention group (0.386 +/- 0.115, P = 0.0429), and the CCR7 mRNA expression levels of these 2 groups were both significantly higher than that of the control group (0.106 +/- 0.029, both P &lt; 0.01). SLC dose-dependently promoted the migration ability of the lymphocytes, but there existed a saturation phenomenon. Exposed to 80 ng/ml SLC the migration level of the lymphocytes of the model group peaked to (85.9 +/- 16.0), 3.7 times as high as that of the control group (20.5 +/- 1.8, P &lt; 0.01), and the migration level of the lymphocytes of the intervention group was 38.2 +/- 6.3, significantly higher than that of the control group too (P &lt; 0.05). SLC enhanced the expression of IFN-gamma of the lymphocytes of the model group, while reduced the IL-10 level, and both effects peaked at the concentration of 80 ng/ml (P = 0.042, P = 0.036.

cell marker CD93 (AA4.1/C1qRp) has been described as a potential complement C1q-receptor. Its exact molecular function, however, remains unknown. By using global expression profiling we showed that CD93-mRNA is highly induced after transient focal cerebral ischemia. CD93 protein is upregulated in endothelial cells, but also in selected macrophages and microglia. To elucidate the potential functional role of CD93 in postischemic brain damage, we used mice with a targeted deletion of the CD93 gene. After 30 min of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and 3 d of reperfusion these mice displayed increased leukocyte infiltration into the brain, increased edema, and significantly larger infarct volumes (60.8 +/- 52.2 versus 23.9 +/- 16.6 mm(3)) when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. When the MCA was occluded for 60 min, after 2 d of reperfusion the CD93 knockout mice still showed more leukocytes in the brain, but the infarct volumes were not different from those seen in WT animals. To further explore CD93-dependent signaling pathways, we determined global transcription profiles and compared CD93-deficient and WT mice at various time points after induction of focal cerebral ischemia. We found a highly significant upregulation of the chemokine CCL21/Exodus-2 in untreated and treated CD93-deficient mice at all time points. Induction of CCL21 mRNA and protein was confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. CCL21, which was formerly shown to be released by damaged neurons and to activate microglia, contributes to neurodegeneration. Thus, we speculate that CD93-neuroprotection is mediated via suppression of the neuroinflammatory response through downregulation of CCL2.
ximately 50 known chemokines are classified in distinct subfamilies: CXC, CC, CX3C, and C. Although the signaling of chemokines often is promiscuous, signaling events between members of these distinct chemokine classes are hardly observed. The only known exception so far is the murine CC chemokine ligand (CCL)21 (secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, Exodus-2, 6Ckine), which binds and activates the murine CXC chemokine receptor CXCR3. However, this exception has not been found in humans. In this study, we provide evidence that human CCL21 is a functional ligand for endogenously expressed CXCR3 in human adult microglia. In absence of CCR7 expression, CCL21 induced chemotaxis of human microglia with efficiency similar to the CXCR3 ligands CXC chemokine ligand 9 (monokine induced by IFN-gamma) and CXC chemokine ligand 10 (IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10). Because human CCL21 did not show any effects in CXCR3-transfected HEK293 cells, it is indicated that CXCR3 signaling depends on the cellular background in which the CXCR3 is expresse.
 lymphoid organ chemokines have been implicated in chronic inflammation. Their expression in the central nervous system (CNS) has not been studied. Here, levels of secondary lymphoid organ chemokines CCL19 (Exodus-3, MIP-3beta), CCL21 (Exodus-2, 6Ckine, SLC) and CXCL12 (SDF-1alpha) were analysed by ELISA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); acute optic neuritis (ON) with oligoclonal IgG in the CSF (i.e., first bout of MS); acute ON without oligoclonal IgG (non-MS-type ON); other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND); and non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND). NIND CSF contained CCL19 and CXCL12, while CCL21 was not detected. Intrathecal production of CCL19 and CCL21 was elevated in MS, MS-type ON, and OIND, but not in non-MS-type ON. In MS, CSF levels of CCL19 weakly correlated with CSF cell counts. Intrathecal production of CXCL12 was elevated only in OIND. The role of elevated CCL19 and CCL21 in MS could be retention of mature dendritic cells (DC) in the CNS, recruitment of nai;ve T cells and activated B cells, as well as de novo formation of secondary lymphoid structures in MS plaque.
ls that mediate T-cell infiltration during T-cell autoimmune diseases are poorly understood. The chemokine CCL21 (originally isolated by us and others as Exodus-2/6Ckine/SLC/TCA4) is highly potent and highly specific for stimulating T-cell migration. However, it is thought to be expressed only in secondary lymphoid organs, directing naive T cells to areas of antigen presentation. It is not thought to play a role in T-cell effector function during a normal immune response. In this study we tested the expression of T-cell chemokines and their receptors during T-cell autoimmune infiltrative skin diseases. By using immunohistology it was found that the expression of CCL21 but not CCL19 or 20 was highly induced in endothelial cells of T-cell autoimmune diseases. The receptor for CCL21, CCR7, was also found to be highly expressed on the infiltrating T cells, most of which expressed the memory CD45Ro phenotype. These data imply that the usual loss of CCL21 responsiveness in the normal development of memory T-cell effector function does not hold for autoimmune skin disease.
s are a family of small proteins that regulate leukocyte infiltration into inflamed tissue and play key roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Some chemokines can also reversibly inhibit the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. We have previously found that the chemokine CCL21 (Exodus-2/SLC/6Ckine/TCA4) is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors. In this study we sought to determine whether this inhibition of proliferation could be therapeutically exploited by protecting normal marrow progenitors from the cytotoxicity of the S phase-active chemotherapeutic agent Ara-.
 and CCL21-pretreated mice were given doses of Ara-C that are toxic to marrow myeloid progenitors. The recovery of these myeloid progenitors was analyzed by colony formation assay.

kine CCL21 may be able to prevent Ara-C myelosuppression during acute leukemia induction chemotherapy, and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality of such therapy, and shorten hospital stay.
kine CCL21, also known as Exodus-2/6-Ckine/secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine/T cell activator protein-4, is the most potent stimulator of T cell migration and adhesion yet described. Endothelial heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are thought to present chemokines at sites of inflammation, maintaining a local concentration gradient to which leukocytes can respond. In contrast, this study found that GAGs markedly inhibit the ability of CCL21 to stimulate T cell adhesion and chemotaxis. Enzymes, such as heparinase, that split GAGs into component-sulfated saccharides abrogate this inhibition, suggesting a mechanism for local tissue regulation of CCL21 function. Low-molecular-weight heparins also strongly inhibit CCL21 adhesion and chemotaxis. Therefore, low-molecular-weight heparins may be effective therapeutic agents in decreasing the pathology of T cell-infiltrative autoimmune diseases by targeting the CCL21 regulation of T cell infiltratio.
 and balanced immunomodulatory response is crucial for the protection of mucosal surfaces being in contact with pathogenic microorganisms. This study examined the local host response mechanisms of epithelial cells in experimental Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata infections by measuring the expression of cytokines at the mRNA and protein level. During the course of infection with active but not with heat-killed C. albicans stimulation of the gene expression levels for interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor, Exodus-2, P-selectin ligand, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-8 was observed by standard and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This cytokine pattern may favor a chemotactic and a T helper 1 response. Initial moderate or weak upregulation of these cytokine genes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was also observed in epithelial infection with the less virulent species C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Heat-killed C. albicans failed to induce an epithelial immune response. At the protein level, expression of interleukin-8 protein was strongly enhanced during the course of C. albicans infection, whereas lower levels were seen with C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. The different expression patterns of cytokines were associated with differences in virulence of the Candida strains. This study's data, therefore, show a correlation between the virulence potential of pathogenic fungi, possibly mediated by specific virulence factors (such as proteinases), and the secretion of epithelial cytokines and chemokines, which may initiate in vivo a protective T helper 1 immunologic response and contribute to the recruitment of activated leukocytes and lymphocytes to the site of mucosal infectio.
s are a large family of cytokines that direct normal leukocyte migration. They also have been implicated in leukocyte development and in the pathogenesis of many diseases. The CC chemokine CCL21, also known as Exodus-2, SLC, 6Ckine, and TCA4 induces both the adhesion and migration of human T cells. CCL21 is hypothesized to regulate the trafficking of T cells through secondary lymphoid tissues. To test this hypothesis, a transgenic mouse model was generated that placed the expression of mouse CCL21 (mCCL21) under the control of the T cell-specific lck promoter to abrogate the concentration gradient to which T cells normally respond. Overexpression of mCCL21 in T cells resulted in defects in CCL21- and CCL19-induced T-cell chemotaxis, node T-cell subpopulations, and lymph node architecture. The regulation of T-cell trafficking in secondary lymphoid tissues by CCL21 is therefore a tightly regulated system that can be altered by changes in the level of environmental CCL21 protei.
 lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC, also referred to as Exodus 2 or 6Ckine) is a recently identified high endothelial-derived CC chemokine. The ability of SLC to chemoattract both Th1 lymphocytes and dendritic cells formed the rationale to evaluate this chemokine in cancer immunotherapy. Intratumoral injection of recombinant SLC evidenced potent antitumor responses and led to complete tumor eradication in 40% of treated mice. SLC-mediated antitumor responses were lymphocyte dependent as evidenced by the fact that this therapy did not alter tumor growth in SCID mice. Studies performed in CD4 and CD8 knockout mice also revealed a requirement for both CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets for SLC-mediated tumor regression. In immunocompetent mice, intratumoral SLC injection led to a significant increase in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, infiltrating both the tumor and the draining lymph nodes. These cell infiltrates were accompanied by the enhanced elaboration of Th1 cytokines and chemokines monokine induced by IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 but a concomitant decrease in immunosuppressive cytokines at the tumor site. In response to irradiated autologous tumor, splenic and lymph node-derived cells from SLC-treated tumor-bearing mice secreted significantly more IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, and IL-12 and reduced levels of IL-10 than did diluent-treated tumor-bearing mice. After stimulation with irradiated autologous tumor, lymph node-derived lymphocytes from SLC-treated tumor-bearing mice demonstrated enhanced cytolytic capacity, suggesting the generation of systemic immune responses. These findings provide a strong rationale for further evaluation of SLC in tumor immunity and its use in cancer immunotherap.
iller (NK) cells play an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses to obligate intracellular pathogens. Nevertheless, the regulation of NK cell trafficking and migration to inflammatory sites is poorly understood. Exodus-1/MIP-3alpha/LARC, Exodus-2/6Ckine/SLC, and Exodus-3/MIP-3beta/ELC/CKbeta-11 are CC chemokines that share a unique aspartate-cysteine-cysteine-leucine motif near their amino terminus and preferentially stimulate the migration of T lymphocytes. The effects of Exodus chemokines on human NK cells were examined. Exodus-1, -2, and -3 did not induce detectable chemotaxis of resting peripheral blood NK cells. In contrast, Exodus-2 and -3 stimulated migration of polyclonal activated peripheral blood NK cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Exodus-2 and -3 also induced dose-dependent chemotaxis of NKL, an IL-2-dependent human NK cell line. Results of modified checkerboard assays indicate that migration of NKL cells in response to Exodus-2 and -3 represents true chemotaxis and not simply chemokinesis. Exodus-1, -2, and -3 did not induce NK cell proliferation in the absence of other stimuli. Nevertheless, Exodus-2 and -3 significantly augmented IL-2-induced proliferation of normal human CD56(dim) NK cells. In contrast, Exodus-1, -2, and -3 did not affect the cytolytic activity of resting or activated peripheral blood NK cells. Expression of message for CCR7, a shared receptor for Exodus-2 and -3, was detected in activated polyclonal NK cells and NKL cells but not resting NK cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Exodus-2 and -3 can participate in the recruitment and proliferation of activated NK cells. Exodus-2 and -3 may regulate interactions between T cells and NK cells that are crucial for the generation of optimal immune response.
s are a family of related proteins that regulate leukocyte infiltration into inflamed tissue and play important roles in disease processes. Among the biologic activities of chemokines is inhibition of proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors. However, chemokines that inhibit normal progenitors rarely inhibit proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We and others recently cloned a subfamily of CC chemokines that share similar amino-terminal peptide sequences and a remarkable ability to chemoattract T cells. These chemokines, Exodus-1/LARC/MIP-3alpha, Exodus-2/SLC/6Ckine/TCA4, and Exodus-3/CKbeta11/MIP-3beta, were found to inhibit proliferation of normal human marrow progenitors. The study described here found that these chemokines also inhibited the proliferation of progenitors in every sample of marrow from patients with CML that was tested. This demonstration of consistent inhibition of CML progenitor proliferation makes the 3 Exodus chemokines unique among chemokines. (Blood. 2000;95:1506-150.
s have been hypothesized to contribute to the selectivity of lymphocyte trafficking not only as chemoattractants, but also by triggering integrin-dependent sticking (arrest) of circulating lymphocytes at venular sites of extravasation. We show that T cells roll on most Peyer's patch high endothelial venules (PP-HEVs), but preferentially arrest in segments displaying high levels of luminal secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) (6Ckine, Exodus-2, thymus-derived chemotactic agent 4 [TCA-4]). This arrest is selectively inhibited by functional deletion (desensitization) of CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), the receptor for SLC and for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3beta (EBV-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine [ELC]), and does not occur in mutant DDD/1 mice that are deficient in these CCR7 ligands. In contrast, pertussis toxin-sensitive B cell sticking does not require SLC or MIP-3beta signaling, and occurs efficiently in SLC(low/-) HEV segments in wild-type mice, and in the SLC-negative HEVs of DDD/1 mice. Remarkably, sites of T and B cell firm adhesion are segregated in PPs, with HEVs supporting B cell accumulation concentrated in or near follicles, the target domain of most B cells entering PPs, whereas T cells preferentially accumulate in interfollicular HEVs. Our findings reveal a fundamental difference in signaling requirements for PP-HEV recognition by T and B cells, and describe an unexpected level of specialization of HEVs that may allow differential, segmental control of lymphocyte subset recruitment into functionally distinct lymphoid microenvironments in viv.
ming to peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) is defined by a multistep sequence of interactions between lymphocytes and endothelial cells in high endothelial venules (HEVs). After initial tethering and rolling via L-selectin, firm adhesion of T cells requires rapid upregulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) adhesiveness by a previously unknown pathway that activates a Galpha(i)-linked receptor. Here, we used intravital microscopy of murine PLNs to study the role of thymus-derived chemotactic agent (TCA)-4 (secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, 6Ckine, Exodus-2) in homing of adoptively transferred T cells from T-GFP mice, a transgenic strain that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) selectively in naive T lymphocytes (T(GFP) cells). TCA-4 was constitutively presented on the luminal surface of HEVs, where it was required for LFA-1 activation on rolling T(GFP) cells. Desensitization of the TCA-4 receptor, CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), blocked T(GFP) cell adherence in wild-type HEVs, whereas desensitization to stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha (the ligand for CXC chemokine receptor 4 [CXCR4]) did not affect T(GFP) cell behavior. TCA-4 protein was not detected on the luminal surface of PLN HEVs in plt/plt mice, which have a congenital defect in T cell homing to PLNs. Accordingly, T(GFP) cells rolled but did not arrest in plt/plt HEVs. When TCA-4 was injected intracutaneously into plt/plt mice, the chemokine entered afferent lymph vessels and accumulated in draining PLNs. 2 h after intracutaneous injection, luminal presentation of TCA-4 was detectable in a subset of HEVs, and LFA-1-mediated T(GFP) cell adhesion was restored in these vessels. We conclude that TCA-4 is both required and sufficient for LFA-1 activation on rolling T cells in PLN HEVs. This study also highlights a hitherto undocumented role for chemokines contained in afferent lymph, which may modulate leukocyte recruitment in draining PLN.
kine receptor CCR-7 is expressed in T, NK, and dendritic cells in a time-ordered and stimulus-dependent manner. Thorough analyses of the pharmacological profiles of the recombinant ligands for CCR-7, MIP-3beta/ELC/CK-beta 11, and SLC/Exodus-2/TCA4/6C-kine, using CCR-7-expressing HEK-293E transfectants determine that ligands both bind with a K(d) in the 100 pM range-10- to 100-fold greater affinities than published K(d) values. High-affinity binding of each ligand is associated with rapid mobilization of intracellular calcium and cell migration as predicted for chemokine GPCRs, and in keeping with more recent evidence, robust activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK.
her workers have recently isolated three novel CC chemokines termed Exodus-1/LARC/Mip-3alpha, Exodus-2/6Ckine/SLC/TCA4, and Exodus-3/Mip-3beta/CKbeta11/ELC. These chemokines share an amino terminal Asp-Cys-Cys-Leu sequence, unique among all chemokines. They also selectively regulate migration of adult T cells. Indeed, there is evidence that Exodus-2 and -3 are critical for adult T-cell adhesion to high endothelial venules in lymph nodes, a rate-limiting step for T-cell trafficking through nodal tissue. Less is known of the factors controlling migration of naïve human fetal T cells. We tested whether these chemokines could regulate chemotaxis in cord blood T-cell populations, and compared that efficacy with normal peripheral blood adult T cells. The findings indicated that naive CD45RA+ cord blood T-cell migration is stimulated by Exodus-2 and -3, and CD4+ cord blood T cells are attracted preferentially by Exodus-2 or -3 as compared with CD8+. Exodus-2 and -3 are likely to be critical in regulating the flux of naive CD4 + fetal T-cell population of secondary lymphoid tissu.
emokine known as 6Ckine (SLC, Exodus-2, or TCA4) has been identified as a ligand for CCR7. Mouse 6Ckine has also been shown to signal through mouse CXCR3 and share some of the activities of IFN-gamma inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by IFN-gamma. Nonetheless, human 6Ckine has not been shown to bind CXCR3 receptor or have angiostatic activity. In this study, we report that human 6Ckine does not induce a calcium flux in either human CXCR3 or mouse CXCR3 transfected cells, although it is an equally potent agonist as mouse 6Ckine and human macrophage inflammatory protein-3beta in human CCR7 transfected cells. Mouse 6Ckine (but not human 6Ckine) is capable of competing with radiolabeled IFN-gamma inducible protein 10 for human CXCR3. In addition, radiolabeled human 6Ckine does not bind to either human CXCR3 or mouse CXCR3. Together these data suggest that human CC chemokine 6Ckine is not a ligand for the human or mouse CXC chemokine receptor CXCR.
hment of leukocytes to the endothelium is a multistep process that depends upon a very rapid increase in the adhesive activity of leukocyte integrins. A pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway stimulates integrin-dependent lymphocyte adhesion to Peyer's patch high endothelial venules in vivo, but the factors responsible for activating this pathway have not been identified previously. We now report that secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC) (also known as 6Ckine, Exodus-2, and thymus-derived chemotactic agent 4), a recently described CC chemokine that is expressed in Peyer's patches and lymph nodes, rapidly activates integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion. Immobilized SLC increased the adhesion of HUT-78 T cells and human PBLs to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, a protein that is expressed on Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node high endothelial venules. This effect of SLC was seen in both static and flow chamber adhesion assays, was mediated by integrin alpha 4 beta 7, and was inhibited by pertussis toxin. The other CC chemokines tested did not increase adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1. SLC had a greater effect on naive CD4+ T cells than on memory CD4+ T cells; CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells were also responsive to SLC. SLC is likely to play an important role in regulating the recruitment of lymphocytes to Peyer's patches and lymph node.
 lymphoid-tissue chemokine, SLC, also known as exodus-2 and 6Ckine, is a novel CC chemokine with selectivity for T lymphocytes and preferential expression in lymphoid tissues. We have studied its production, receptor usage and biological activities. High levels of SLC mRNA were detected in lymph nodes, the gastrointestinal tract and several gland tissues, but no expression was found by Northern blot analysis in freshly isolated or stimulated blood monocytes and lymphocytes, or neutrophils and eosinophils. In situ hybridization revealed constitutive expression of SLC in the T cell areas and the marginal zone of follicles in lymph nodes and the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, but not in B cell areas or sinuses. Comparison with immunocytochemical staining showed similarity between the in situ expression of SLC and the distribution of interdigitating dendritic cells but not with sinus-lining dendritic cells, macrophages or T lymphocytes. SLC induced chemotaxis of T lymphocytes and its activity increased considerably when the cells were conditioned with IL-2 or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Under optimal conditions SLC had unusually high efficacy and induced the migration of up to 50 % of input T lymphocytes. SLC also induced Ca2+ mobilization in these cells. Similar responses were obtained with EBI1 ligand chemokine (ELC), and sequential stimulation with both chemokines led to cross-desensitization, suggesting that SLC acts via the ELC receptor, CCR7. This was confirmed using murine pre-B cells stably transfected with CCR7 which bound SLC with high affinity and showed chemotaxis and Ca2+ mobilization in response to both SLC and ELC. In T lymphocytes PHA and IL-2, which enhanced chemotactic responsiveness, also markedly enhanced CCR7 expression. In contrast to all known chemokine receptors, up-regulation of CCR7 by IL-2 was transient. A maximum was reached in 2-3 days and expression returned to initial levels within 8-10 days. The present study shows that SLC is constitutively produced within the T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs and attracts T lymphocytes via CCR.
chemokine known as 6-C-kine, secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC), TCA4, or Exodus-2 (herein referred to as 6CK/SLC) can trigger rapid integrin-dependent arrest of lymphocytes rolling under physiological shear and is highly expressed by high endothelial venules, specialized vessels involved in lymphocyte homing from the blood into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. We show that 6CK/SLC is an agonist for the lymphocyte chemoattractant receptor, CCR7 (EBI-1, BLR-2), previously described as a receptor for the related beta chemokine MIP-3beta (ELC or Exodus-3). Moreover, 6CK/SLC and MIP-3beta attract the same major populations of circulating lymphocytes, including naive and memory T cells &gt; B cells (but not natural killer cells); desensitization to MIP-3beta inhibits lymphocyte chemotaxis to 6CK/SLC but not to the alpha chemokine SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor); and 6CK/SLC competes for MIP-3beta binding to resting mouse lymphocytes. The findings suggest that the majority of circulating lymphocytes respond to 6CK/SLC and MIP-3beta in large part through their common receptor CCR7 and that these molecules may be important mediators of physiological lymphocyte recirculation in viv.
ng lymphocytes are recruited from the blood to the tissue by rolling along the endothelium until being stopped by a signaling event linked to the Gialpha subunit of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; that event then triggers rapid integrin-dependent adhesion. Four chemokines are now shown to induce such adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and to induce arrest of rolling cells within 1 second under flow conditions similar to those of blood. SDF-1 (also called PBSF), 6-C-kine (also called Exodus-2), and MIP-3beta (also called ELC or Exodus-3) induced adhesion of most circulating lymphocytes, including most CD4+ T cells; and MIP-3alpha (also called LARC or Exodus-1) triggered adhesion of memory, but not naïve, CD4+ T cells. Thus, chemokines can regulate the arrest of lymphocyte subsets under flowing conditions, which may allow them to control lymphocyte-endothelial cell recognition and lymphocyte recruitment in viv.
is of T cell numbers in the periphery implies an ability of lymphocytes to sense cell numbers. Although the mechanisms are unknown, we find that the chemokine CCL21 (also known as TCA4, SLC, 6Ckine), a ligand for the chemokine receptor CCR7, can regulate homeostasis of CD4 (but not CD8) T cells. In the absence of CCR7 ligands, transferred CD4 T cells failed to expand in lymphopenic hosts, whereas in the presence of CCL21 overexpression, homeostatic CD4 T cell proliferation occurred even in nonlymphopenic recipients. Ag-specific CD4 T cells transferred into Ag-expressing mice proliferated and induced autoimmunity only in lymphopenic recipients. Pancreatic expression of CCL21 was sufficient to replace the requirement for lymphopenia in the progression of autoimmune disease. These results suggest that CD4 T cells use local concentrations of CCR7 ligands as an index of T cell steady state numbers and that homeostatic expansion of the T cell population may be a contributing factor in the development of autoimmune diseas.
hether accumulation of naive lymphocytes is sufficient to trigger lymphoid development, we generated mice with islet expression of the chemokine TCA4/SLC. This chemokine is specific for naive lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells (DC) which express the CCR7 receptor. Islets initially developed accumulations of T cells with DC, with scattered B cells at the perimeter. These infiltrates consolidated into organized lymphoid tissue, with high endothelial venules and stromal reticulum. Infiltrate lymphocytes showed a naive CD44low CD25- CD69- phenotype, though half were CD62L negative. When backcrossed to RAG-1 knockout, DC were not recruited. Interestingly, islet lymphoid tissue developed in backcrosses to Ikaros knockout mice despite the absence of normal peripheral nodes. Our results indicate that TCA4/SLC can induce the development and organization of lymphoid tissue through diffential recruitment of T and B lymphocytes and secondary effects on stromal cell developmen.
s induce chemotaxis of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), and suppress their proliferation. In this study we report that SLC/ Exodus2/6Ckine/TCA4 (hereafter termed SLC) is a chemoattractant for human CD34+ HPC. SLC mainly induces preferential chemotaxis of macrophage progenitors. We examined the chemotactic activity of CXCR3 ligands on CD34+ HPC because it has been reported that SLC is a potential ligand of CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR3, in addition to a CC chemokine receptor, CCR7. It was found that the CXCR3 ligands, MIG and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10), unlike SLC, did not induce chemotaxis of CD34+ HPC. In this regard, CCR7 ligands (SLC and CKbeta-11), but not IP-10 and MIG, induce actin polymerization in CD34+ cells. On the other hand, CCR7 ligands and CXCR3 ligands, but not the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1, showed inhibitory activity for proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. Our results suggest that SLC is a potential trafficking factor for HPC, and that chemokines that bind CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR3 have differential biological activities on HPC in terms of suppression and chemotaxi.
 CC chemokines, SLC/6Ckine/Exodus2/TCA4 and CKbeta-11/MIP-3beta/ELC, are previously reported as efficacious chemoattractants for T- and B-cells and dendritic cells. SLC and CKbeta-11 share only 32% amino acid identity, but are ligands for the same chemokine receptor, CCR7. In this study, we examined chemotactic activity of SLC and CKbeta-11 for NK cells and lymphoid progenitors in bone marrow and thymus. It was found that these two CCR7 ligands are chemoattractants for neonatal cord blood and adult peripheral blood NK cells and cell lines. SLC and CKbeta-11 preferentially attract the CD56(+)CD16(-) NK cell subset over CD56(+)CD16(+) NK cells. SLC and CKbeta-11 also demonstrate selective chemotactic activity on late stage CD34(-)CD19(+)IgM- B-cell progenitors and CD4(+) and CD8(+) single-positive thymocytes, but not early stage progenitors. It was noted that SLC is an efficient desensitizer of CKbeta-11-dependent NK cell chemotaxis, while CKbeta-11 is a weak desensitizer of SLC-dependent chemotaxis. Taken together, these results suggest that SLC and CKbeta-11 have the potential to control trafficking of NK cell subsets and late stage lymphoid progenitors in bone marrow and thymu.
resenting cells play a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). It was hypothesised that lymphangiogenesis is involved in the pathophysiology of HP via cell transpor.
ine the clinical significance of lymphangiogenic factors in H.
 vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and CCL21 in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured in 29 healthy volunteers, 14 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 26 patients with HP by ELISA. Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses were performed using lung specimens of patients with HP (n=8) and IPF (n=10.
-D levels were significantly elevated in patients with HP compared to the other groups. BALF VEGF-D levels in patients with HP correlated significantly with the BALF total cell and lymphocyte counts (r=0.485, p=0.014 and r=0.717, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). BALF VEGF-C and CCL21 levels were increased in patients with HP compared to healthy volunteers, but not patients with IPF. BALF CCL21 levels were negatively correlated with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s percentage and diffuse capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (r=-0.662, p=0.007 and r=-0.671, p=0.024, respectively). According to the immunohistochemical analyses, CCL21 was expressed in the lymphatic endothelium in both conditions and CCR7(+) cells were aggregated around lymphatics in patients with HP, but not in patients with IP.
ogenic factors might be associated with the inflammatory and functional severity of HP. The increased BALF VEGF-D levels were associated with lymphatic alveolitis intensity, and CCL21 with lung function impairmen.
s are a large family of chemotactic cytokines. Based on the arrangement of the first two cysteine residues, chemokines are divided into four groups, one of which is the CC chemokine group. In this study, we characterized a CC chemokine, CsCCL21, from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), and analyzed its activity. CsCCL21 contains two conserved N-terminal cysteine residues in a NCCL motif and is phylogenetically related to the CCL19/21/25 subgroup of CC chemokines. CsCCL21 was constitutively expressed in nine tissues and significantly upregulated by bacterial and viral infection. The recombinant CsCCL21 (rCsCCL21) induced migration of peripheral blood leukocytes. When the two conserved cysteine residues in the NCCL motif were mutated, the chemotactic activity of rCsCCL21 was abolished. rCsCCL21 enhanced the resistance of tongue sole against bacterial infection, but the mutant protein with NCCL mutation lacked this antibacterial effect. Taken together, these results suggest that CsCCL21 is a functional CC chemokine with the ability to recruit leukocytes and is involved in antibacterial immunity in a manner that requires the conserved NCCL moti.
vation of cellular inflammatory effectors adversely affects myocardial function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The CC-chemokine CCL21 is, via its receptor CCR7, one of the key regulators of inflammation and immune cell recruitment, participates in various inflammatory disorders, including cardiovascular ones. This study explored the therapeutic effect of an anti-CCL21 antibody in cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarctio.
 model of AMI generated by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in C57BL/6 mice resulted in higher levels of circulating CCL21 and cardiac CCR7. Neutralization of CCL21 by intravenous injection of anti-CCL21 monoclonal antibody reduced infarct size after AMI, decreased serum levels of neutrophil and monocyte chemo attractants post AMI, diminished neutrophil and macrophage recruitment in infarcted myocardium, and suppressed MMP-9 and total collagen content in myocardium. Anti-CCL21 treatment also limited cardiac enlargement and improved left ventricular functio.
 indicated that CCL21 was involved in cardiac remodeling post infarction and anti-CCL21 strategies might be useful in the treatment of AM.
abetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by the selective destruction of pancreatic β cells, followed by hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and the subsequent extensive impairment of immune cell functions, a phenomenon responsible for the development of chronic diabetic complications. Propolis, a natural bee product that is extensively used in foods and beverages, significantly benefits human health. Specifically, propolis exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects that may improve diabetic complications. To further elucidate the potential benefits of propolis, the present study investigated the effect of dietary supplementation with propolis on the plasma cytokine profiles, free radical levels, lipid profile and lymphocyte proliferation and chemotaxis in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I diabetic mouse mode.
le mice were equally distributed into 3 experimental groups: group 1, non-diabetic control mice; group 2, diabetic mice; and group 3, diabetic mice supplemented daily with an ethanol-soluble derivative of propolis (100&nbsp;mg/kg body weight) for 1&nbsp;mont.
e induction of diabetes in mice was associated with hyperglycemia and significant decreases in the insulin level and the lymphocyte count. In this context, diabetic mice exhibited severe diabetic complications, as demonstrated by a significant decrease in the levels of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-7, prolonged elevation of the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered lipid profiles compared with control non-diabetic mice. Moreover, antigen stimulation of B and T lymphocytes markedly reduced the proliferative capacity and chemotaxis of these cells towards CCL21 and CXCL12 in diabetic mice compared with control mice. Interestingly, compared with diabetes induction alone, treatment of diabetic mice with propolis significantly restored the plasma cytokine and ROS levels and the lipid profile to nearly normal levels. Most importantly, compared with untreated diabetic mice, diabetic mice treated with propolis exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and chemotaxis towards CCL21 and CXCL1.
ngs reveal the potential immuno-modulatory effects of propolis, which acts as a natural antioxidant to enhance the function of immune cells during diabete.
fector T cells recirculate through extralymphoid tissues by entering from blood and egressing via afferent lymph. Although T cell entry into effector sites is key to inflammation, the relevance of T cell egress to this process is unknown. In this study, we found that Ag recognition at the effector site reduced the tissue egress of proinflammatory Th1 cells in a mouse model of delayed hypersensitivity. Transgenic expression of &quot;tissue exit receptor&quot; CCR7 enhanced lymphatic egress of Ag-sequestered Th1 cells from the inflamed site and alleviated inflammation. In contrast, lack of CCR7 on Th1 cells diminished their tissue egress while enhancing inflammation. Lymph-borne Th1 and Th17 cells draining the inflamed skin of sheep migrated toward the CCR7 ligand CCL21, suggesting the CCR7-CCL21 axis as a physiological target in regulating inflammation. In conclusion, exit receptors can be targeted to modulate T cell dwell time and inflammation at effector sites, revealing T cell tissue egress as a novel control point of inflammatio.
tive was to better understand the roles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CCL21, ERBB3, and TERT genes region in the development of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), we explored the associations between SNPs in the mentioned three genes and IIMs susceptibility in a Chinese Han populatio.
olymyositis (PM) patients (n =291), dermatomyositis (DM) patients (n=526) and ethnically-matched healthy controls (n =968) were genotyped for the CCL21 region SNPs (rs951005 and rs2492358), ERBB3 (rs2292239 and rs11171739), and TERT (rs2853676 and rs10069690), by using the Sequenom MassArray syste.
 indicated strong allele and genotype associations between rs951005 (OR: 1.65, 95%CI: 1.18-2.30, Pc=0.015; Pc=0.041, respectively) in CCL21 gene and PM patients. Additionally, rs951005 was associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in PM patients (Pc =0.01), and was associated with PM patients in additive model. However, the Chinese Han PM/DM patients and controls had statistically similar frequencies of alleles, genotypes and different genetic models (additive, dominant, and recessive) of ERBB3 and TERT polymorphism.
the first study to demonstrate that the CCL21 gene SNP (rs951005) might confer genetic predisposition to PM patients or such patients with ILD in a Chinese Han populatio.
lar prion protein is expressed in almost all tissues, including the central nervous system and lymphoid tissues. To investigate the effects of the prion protein in lymphoid cells and spleen structure formation, we used prion protein-deficient (Prnp(0/0)) Zürich I mice generated by inactivation of the Prnp gene. Prnp(0/0) mice had decreased lymphocytes, in particular, CD4 T cells and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells. Decreased CD4 T cells resulted from impaired expression of CCL19 and CCL21 in the spleen rather than altered chemokine receptor CCR7 expression. Importantly, some of the white pulp regions in spleens from Prnp(0/0) mice displayed impaired T zone structure as a result of decreased LTi cell numbers and altered expression of the lymphoid tissue-organizing genes lymphotoxin-α and CXCR5, although expression of the lymphatic marker podoplanin and CXCL13 by stromal cells was not affected. In addition, CD3(-)CD4(+)IL-7Rα(+) LTi cells were rarely detected in impaired white pulp in spleens of these mice. These data suggest that the prion protein is required to form the splenic white pulp structure and for development of normal levels of CD4 T and LTi cell.
ural killer (NK) cell subsets differentially distribute throughout the organism. While CD56(dim) and CD56(bright) NK cell subsets similarly reside in the bone marrow (BM), the CD56(dim) population predominantly accumulates in non-lymphoid tissues and the CD56(bright) counterpart in lymphoid tissue (LT). The dynamics with which these NK cell subsets redistribute to tissues remains unexplored. Here, we studied individuals newly exposed to fingolimod, a drug that efficiently blocks sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-directed lymphocyte - including NK cell - egress from tissue to blood. During an observation period of 6h peripheral blood depletion of CD56(bright) NK cells was observed 3&nbsp;h after first dose of fingolimod, with 40-50% depletion after 6&nbsp;h, while a decrease of the numbers of CD56(dim) NK cells did not reach the level of statistical significance. In vitro, CD56(bright) and CD56(dim) NK cells responded comparably to the BM-homing chemokine CXCL12, while CD56(bright) NK cells migrated more efficiently in gradients of the LT-homing chemokines CCL19 and CCL21. In conjuncture with these in&nbsp;vitro studies, the indirectly observed subset-specific depletion kinetics from blood are compatible with preferential and more rapid redistribution of CD56(bright) NK cells from blood to peripheral tissue such as LT and possibly also the inflamed central nervous system. These data shed light on an unexplored level at which access of NK cells to LT, and thus, for example antigen-presenting cells, is regulate.
 MUTZ-3 acute myeloid leukemia cell line has been used as a dendritic cell (DC) differentiation model. This cell line can be cultured into Langerhans cell (LC) or interstitial DC-like cells using the same cytokine cocktails used for the differentiation of their primary counterparts. Currently, there is an increasing interest in the study and clinical application of DC generated in the presence of IFNα, as these IFNα-DC produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines and have been suggested to be more potent in their ability to cross-present protein antigens, as compared to the more commonly used IL-4-DC. Here, we report on the generation of IFNα-induced MUTZ-DC. We show that IFNα MUTZ-DC morphologically and phenotypically display characteristic DC features and are functionally equivalent to &quot;classic&quot; IL-4 MUTZ-DC. IFNα MUTZ-DC ingest exogenous antigens and can subsequently cross-present HLA class-I restricted epitopes to specific CD8+ T cells. Importantly, mature IFNα MUTZ-DC express CCR7, migrate in response to CCL21, and are capable of priming naïve antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, we show that the MUTZ-3 cell line offers a viable and sustainable model system to study IFNα driven DC development and functionalit.
 an IgG1 human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to human CCL21, a chemokine hypothesized to play a role in inflammatory disease conditions through activation of resident CCR7-expressing fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of QBP359 in non-human primates were characterized through an integrated approach, combining PK, PD, immunogenicity, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue profiling data from single- and multiple-dose experiments in cynomolgus monkeys. When compared with regular immunoglobulin typical kinetics, faster drug clearance was observed in serum following intravenous administration of 10&nbsp;mg/kg and 50&nbsp;mg/kg of QBP359. We have shown by means of PK/PD modeling that clearance of mAb-ligand complex is the most likely explanation for the rapid clearance of QBP359 in cynomolgus monkey. IHC and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry data suggested a high turnover and synthesis rate of CCL21 in tissues. Although lymphoid tissue was expected to accumulate drug due to the high levels of CCL21 present, bioavailability following subcutaneous administration in monkeys was 52%. In human disease states, where CCL21 expression is believed to be expressed at 10-fold higher concentrations compared with cynomolgus monkeys, the PK/PD model of QBP359 and its binding to CCL21 suggested that very large doses requiring frequent administration of mAb would be required to maintain suppression of CCL21 in the clinical setting. This highlights the difficulty in targeting soluble proteins with high synthesis rate.
f lymphatics in the anterior human uvea are contradictory. This might be caused due to a certain topography, which has not been considered yet. Therefore, here we systematically analyze iris and adjacent ciliary body with immunohistochemistry by combining various lymphatic marker.
s and ciliary body were obtained from cornea donors and prepared for cryosectioning. Cross sections of tissue blocks at 12/3/6/9 o'clock position and at corresponding intersections (1:30/4:30/7:30/10:30) were processed for immunohistochemistry of LYVE-1, PDPN, PROX1, FOXC2, VEGFR3, and CCL21, and when necessary, these lymphatic markers were combined with CD31, α-smooth muscle-actin, CD68, and 4',6-diamidino-2 phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). Double, triple, and quadruple marker combinations were documented using confocal microscop.
podoplanin+ cells were mainly located at the anterior border of the iris while LYVE-1+ cells were distributed throughout the nonpigmented part. Both cell populations were PROX1/FOXC2/CCL21/VEGFR3-. Blood vessels, iris smooth muscles, and individual cells were VEGFR3+. While PDPN+ cells were rarely detected posteriorly of the iris root, many LYVE-1+ cells were present within the ciliary body muscle and villi. Within the muscle, occasionally PDPN+ vessel-like structures were detectable, but these were never colocalized with LYVE-1. Similar vessel-like structures were VEGFR3+/PROX1-/CCL21-, but CD31+. Further, ciliary muscle fibers and ciliary epithelium were immunoreactive for VEGFR3/CCL21, but were LYVE-1/PDPN-. A certain topography of structures at the various uvea-positions investigated was not obvious. The majority of LYVE-1+ cells displayed immunoreactivity for CD6.
 vessels colocalizing for at least two lymphatic markers were not detectable. Therefore, if present, putative lymphatic channels of the anterior uvea might display a different marker panel than generally presume.
abetes mellitus (T1D) is associated with increased type 1 interferon (IFN) levels and subsequent severe defects in lymphocyte function, which increase susceptibility to infections. The blockade of type 1 IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) in non-obese diabetic mice has been shown to delay T1D onset and decrease T1D incidence by enhancing spleen CD4+ T cells and restoring B cell function. However, the effect of type 1 IFN blockade during T1D on splenic CD8+ T cells has not previously been studied. Therefore, we investigated, for the first time, the effect of IFNAR1 blockade on the survival and architecture of spleen-homing CD8+ T cells in a streptozotocin-induced T1D mouse model. Three groups of mice were examined: a non-diabetic control group; a diabetic group; and a diabetic group treated with an anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody. We observed that T1D induction was accompanied by a marked destruction of β cells followed by a marked reduction in insulin levels and increased IFN-α and IFN-β levels in the diabetic group. The diabetic mice also exhibited many abnormal changes including an elevation in blood and spleen free radical (reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) levels, a significant decrease in IL-7 levels, and subsequently, a significant decrease in the numbers of spleen-homing CD8+ T cells. This decrease in spleen-homing CD8+ T cells resulted from a marked reduction in the CCL21-mediated entry of CD8+ T cells into the spleen and from increased apoptosis due to a marked reduction in IL-7-mediated STAT5 and AKT phosphorylation. Interestingly, type 1 IFN signaling blockade in diabetic mice significantly restored the numbers of splenic CD8+ T cells by restoring free radical, pro-inflammatory cytokine and IL-7 levels. These effects subsequently rescued splenic CD8+ T cells from apoptosis through a mechanism that was dependent upon CCL21- and IL-7-mediated signaling. Our data suggest that type 1 IFN is an essential mediator of pathogenesis in T1D and that this role results from the negative effect of IFN signaling on the survival of splenic CD8+ T cell.
n combines the innate and adaptive immune systems in a uniquely organized way. The excision of spleen will induce many complications, especially the increased susceptibility to infections. Recent research shows that besides playing roles during the immune responses, the spleen is also an important organ during immunoregulation, which is different from other secondary lymphoid organs. This unique function is mainly realized by modulating cell migration and proliferation in the spleen. This review provides a better understanding of the functions of this complex organ gained from recent studie.
ional relevance of synovial ectopic lymphoid neogenesis (ELN) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains unknown. As ELN correlates with the degree of tissue inflammation, we investigated whether ELN was associated with specific cytokine profile.
ELN was determined by immunohistology and long CD21 isoform (CD21L) expression. Cytokine expression was determined by multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as immunohistology in synovial fluid (SF) (n = 44) and tissue (ST) (n = 108), respectively. Production of ELN-associated chemokines by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) was studied in vitr.
 analysis of SF by multiplex ELISA showed higher protein levels of interleukin (IL)-23 (p = 0.018) and IL-17F (p = 0.028) in ELN+ versus ELN- samples. Other cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were not different. The association between IL-23 and ELN was not biased by disease activity or other clinical features and was confirmed by higher IL-23 mRNA expression in ELN+ versus ELN- ST samples (p = 0.030), a correlation between IL-23 and CD21L expression in the same samples (r = 0.70 p &lt; 0.0001), and a similar correlation in two independent ST sample sets (r = 0.778 p &lt; 0.0001 and r = 0.817 p = 0.011). IL-23 p19 staining was neither restricted nor enhanced in close proximity of ectopic lymphoid follicles, and neither IL-23 nor IL-17A stimulation induced expression of the ELN-associated CC chemokine ligand, CCL21 and CXC chemokine ligand CXCL13, by FLS. Downstream of IL-23, CD21L expression was significantly associated with IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22, but not IL-17A in two independent ST sample set.
ELN in RA is strongly associated with activation of the IL-23 pathway but not with IL-17.
 To identify the distribution of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21) in the thymus of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and explore the effects of up-regulation of CCL21 on the expressions of antigen presentation-related genes in cytokeratin 8/18 (CK8/18) positive thymic epithelial cells (TECs) after transfected with CCL21 genes. Methods The expressions and distributions of CK8/18 and CCL21 in the thymus tissue of MG patients were detected by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA levels of CCL21, CCL19 and their receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 7 (CCR7) in the thymus tissue of MG patients were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Primary cultured CK8/18(+) TECs were transfected with pCMV-CCL21, and the relative mRNA expressions of function-associated genes (CD80, ICAM-1, CD86, HLA-DR, HLA-A) in CK8/18(+) TECs before and after the transfection were investigated by qRT-PCR. Results Immunohistochemical results showed that the number of CK8/18 positive cells in the hyperplastic thymus tissues of MG patients was significantly more than that in the normal controls, and the protein expression of CCL21 was also much higher in the hyperplastic thymus tissues. The qRT-PCR showed that the expressions of CCL21 and CCR7 mRNA increased significantly in hyperplastic thymus tissues of MG patients compared with those in normal controls, while there was no difference in the expression of CCL19. Furthermore, CK8/18 positive cells were found mainly located in cortico-medullary junction and medulla area. The relative mRNA expression levels of HLA-A, HLA-DR, ICAM and CD80 rose significantly in CK8/18(+) TECs after transfected with pCMV-CCL21. Conclusion The over-expression of CCL21 could increased the expressions of antigen presentation-related genes in CK8/18(+) TECs in MG patient.
 CCL21 are chemokines involved in the trafficking of immune cells, particularly within the lymphatic system, through activation of CCR7. Concurrent expression of PSGL-1 and CCR7 in naive T-cells enhances recruitment of these cells to secondary lymphoid organs by CCL19 and CCL21. Here the solution structure of CCL19 is reported. It contains a canonical chemokine domain. Chemical shift mapping shows the N-termini of PSGL-1 and CCR7 have overlapping binding sites for CCL19 and binding is competitive. Implications for the mechanism of PSGL-1's enhancement of resting T-cell recruitment are discusse.
l imaging has revealed that T cells change their migratory behavior during physiological activation inside lymphoid tissue. Yet, it remains less well investigated how the intrinsic migratory capacity of activated T cells is regulated by chemokine receptor levels or other regulatory elements. Here, we used an adjuvant-driven inflammation model to examine how motility patterns corresponded with CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR5 expression levels on ovalbumin-specific DO11.10 CD4(+) T cells in draining lymph nodes. We found that while CCR7 and CXCR4 surface levels remained essentially unaltered during the first 48-72 h after activation of CD4(+) T cells, their in vitro chemokinetic and directed migratory capacity to the respective ligands, CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL12, was substantially reduced during this time window. Activated T cells recovered from this temporary decrease in motility on day 6 post immunization, coinciding with increased migration to the CXCR5 ligand CXCL13. The transiently impaired CD4(+) T cell motility pattern correlated with increased LFA-1 expression and augmented phosphorylation of the microtubule regulator Stathmin on day 3 post immunization, yet neither microtubule destabilization nor integrin blocking could reverse TCR-imprinted unresponsiveness. Furthermore, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition did not restore chemotactic activity, ruling out PKC-mediated receptor desensitization as mechanism for reduced migration in activated T cells. Thus, we identify a cell-intrinsic, chemokine receptor level-uncoupled decrease in motility in CD4(+) T cells shortly after activation, coinciding with clonal expansion. The transiently reduced ability to react to chemokinetic and chemotactic stimuli may contribute to the sequestering of activated CD4(+) T cells in reactive peripheral lymph nodes, allowing for integration of costimulatory signals required for full activatio.
yeloid leukemia is a clonal disease characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome and its oncogenic product, BCR-ABL, which activates multiple pathways involved in cell survival, growth promotion, and disease progression. We previously reported that in murine hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells, signal transducing adaptor protein-2 (STAP-2) binds to BCR-ABL and up-regulates BCR-ABL phosphorylation, leading to enhanced activation of its downstream signaling molecules. The binding of STAP-2 to BCR-ABL also influenced the expression levels of chemokine receptors, such as CXCR4 and CCR7. For the induction of CCR7 expression, signals mediated by the MAPK/ERK pathway were critical in Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL and STAP-2. In addition, STAP-2 cooperated with BCR-ABL to induce the production of CCR7 ligands, CCL19 and CCL21. Our results demonstrate a contribution of CCR7 to STAP-2-dependent enhancement of BCR-ABL-mediated cell growth in Ba/F3 cell.
derived dendritic cells (DCs) are used as immunoadjuvant cells in cancer vaccines and have made great progress. However, an optimal DCs subset is vital for this treatment effect, the current 'gold standard' cytokine cocktail DCs have a shortcoming in their cytokines secretion, especially IL-12p70, mainly because of the existence of PGE2. Therefore, it is necessary to find an appropriate DCs-based immunotherapeutic protocol. In this study, we compared a novel 'improved' maturation cytokine cocktail with the current 'gold standard' maturation cytokine cocktail used for generating standard DCs. The 'improved' maturation cytokine cocktail DCs showed a higher levels surface markers expression (CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR), the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 and chemokine CCL19, CCL21 and CXCL21, whereas CCR5 expression was reduced. Most importantly, in contrast to 'gold standard' DCs, which secrete little IL-12p70 and as a result induce mainly Th2 immunity, 'improved' cytokine cocktail DCs secreted higher levels IL-12p70 and also secreted similar concentration IL-10. To removal of PGE2 from the 'improved' DCs did increase the IL-12p70 production. In conclusion, we here present the 'improved' DCs, as an optimal maturation cocktail protocol, can induce high migratory potential, generate immunostimulatory DCs, produce higher levels IL-12p70 with superior capacity to induce Th1 immunity, when compared with the 'gold standard' DC.
on to the secretion of Ag-specific Abs, B cells may play an important role in the generation of immune responses by efficiently presenting Ag to T cells. We and other investigators recently described a subpopulation of CD11c(+) B cells (Age/autoimmune-associated B cells [ABCs]) that appear with age, during virus infections, and at the onset of some autoimmune diseases and participate in autoimmune responses by secreting autoantibodies. In this study, we assessed the ability of these cells to present Ag and activate Ag-specific T cells. We demonstrated that ABCs present Ag to T cells, in vitro and in vivo, better than do follicular B cells (FO cells). Our data indicate that ABCs express higher levels of the chemokine receptor CCR7, have higher responsiveness to CCL21 and CCL19 than do FO cells, and are localized at the T/B cell border in spleen. Using multiphoton microscopy, we show that, in vivo, CD11c(+) B cells form significantly more stable interactions with T cells than do FO cells. Together, these data identify a previously undescribed role for ABCs as potent APCs and suggest another potential mechanism by which these cells can influence immune responses and/or the development of autoimmunit.
nce of lymph node (LN)-like vasculature in tumours, characterized by expression of peripheral node addressin and chemokine CCL21, is correlated with T-cell infiltration and positive prognosis in breast cancer and melanoma patients. However, mechanisms controlling the development of LN-like vasculature and how it might contribute to a beneficial outcome for cancer patients are unknown. Here we demonstrate that LN-like vasculature is present in murine models of melanoma and lung carcinoma. It enables infiltration by naive T cells that significantly delay tumour outgrowth after intratumoral activation. Development of this vasculature is controlled by a mechanism involving effector CD8 T cells and NK cells that secrete LTα3 and IFNγ. LN-like vasculature is also associated with organized aggregates of B lymphocytes and gp38(+) fibroblasts, which resemble tertiary lymphoid organs that develop in models of chronic inflammation. These results establish LN-like vasculature as both a consequence of and key contributor to anti-tumour immunit.
l documented that inflammatory chemokines play a significant role in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Recently, the involvement of homeostatic (or lymphoid) chemokines in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases has become an object of intensive study. In this work, quantitative analysis of CCL19, CCL21 and CCR7 expression in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as in inflammatory mononuclear cells isolated from several organs during the first attack, remission and the second attack of chronic-relapsing EAE (ChREAE), was performed. Using real-time PCR, RNAse Protection Assay and immunohistochemistry, the expression of both chemokines, as well as of their common receptor CCR7, was analyzed in the brain, spleen, lymph nodes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Increased expression of CCL19 and CCL21 was observed mostly in mononuclear inflammatory cells isolated from the CNS during active ChREAE. At the same time the expression of CCR7 in blood mononuclear leukocytes was reduced. This observation extends our current knowledge about the possible role of chemokines CCL19, CCL21 and their receptor CCR7 in the pathogenesis of ChREAE and, by extension, M.
lity to target cancer stem cells (CSC) may be a significant factor contributing to treatment failure. We have developed a strategy to target the CSC populations in melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma using CSC lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs). The CSC-DC vaccine was administered in the adjuvant setting after localized radiation therapy of established tumors. Using mouse models we demonstrated that DCs pulsed with CSCs enriched by virtue of their expression of the CSC marker ALDH (termed CSC-DC) significantly inhibited tumor growth, reduced development of pulmonary metastases and prolonged survival. The effect was associated with downregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) receptors CCR7 and CCR10 in tumor cells and decreased expression of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligands CCL21, CCL27 and CCL28 in lung tissue. The CSC-DC vaccine significantly reduced ALDH(high) CSC frequency in primary tumors. Direct targeting of CSCs was demonstrated by the specific binding of IgG produced by ALDH(high) CSC-DC vaccine-primed B cells to ALDH(high) CSCs, resulting in lysis of these target CSCs in the presence of complement. These data suggest that the CSC-DC vaccine approach may be useful in the adjuvant setting where local and systemic relapse are high after conventional treatment of cancer.
f this study was to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the location of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) at different anatomical sites. We speculated that the malignant B cells in these disorders have the potential for trafficking between blood and secondary lymphoid organs (SLO) or extranodal sites and that their preferential accumulation at different locations is governed by the expression of key molecules that regulate the trafficking of normal lymphocyte.
 blood samples from 91 cases of B-NHL affecting SLO (n = 27), ocular adnexae (n = 51) or blood (n = 13) were analysed by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry for the expression of the following molecules: CCR7, CCL21 and αL (required for the entry of normal lymphocytes into SLO); CXCR4, CXCL12 and α4 (required for entry into extranodal sites); CXCR5, CXCL13 and S1PR2 (required for tissue retention); S1PR1 and S1PR3 (required for egress into the blood). The expression of each of these molecules was then related to anatomical location and histological subtyp.
ssion of motility/adhesion molecules varied widely between individual patient samples and correlated much more strongly with anatomical location than with histological subtype. SLO lymphomas [comprising 10 follicular lymphoma (FL), 8 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 4 mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) and 5 marginal-zone lymphoma (MZL)] were characterised by pronounced over-expression of S1PR2, suggesting that the malignant cells in these lymphomas are actively retained at the site of clonal expansion. In contrast, the malignant B cells in ocular adnexal lymphomas (10 FL, 9 DLBCL, 4 MCL and 28 MZL) expressed a profile of molecules suggesting a dynamic process of trafficking involving not only tissue retention but also egress via S1PR3 and homing back to extranodal sites via CXCR4/CXCL12 and α4. Finally, leukaemic lymphomas (6 FL, 5 MCL and 2 MZL) were characterised by aberrant expression of the egress receptor S1PR1 and low expression of molecules required for tissue entry/retentio.
y, our study strongly suggests that anatomical location in B-NHL is governed by the differential expression of specific adhesion/motility molecules. This novel observation has important implications for therapeutic strategies that aim to disrupt protective micro-environmental interaction.
 distinct lymphoid organs enables chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to receive pro-survival and proliferative signals. Cytogenetic aberrations can significantly affect CLL cell compartmentalization. Trisomy 12 (tri12) defines a CLL subgroup with specific clinical features and increased levels of the negative prognostic marker CD49d, the α4-subunit of the integrin VLA-4, which is a key regulator of CLL cell homing to bone marrow (BM). Chemokine-induced inside-out VLA-4 activation, particularly via the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis, increases the arrest of various cell types on VCAM-1 presenting endothelium. Here, we demonstrate that high CD49d expression in tri12 CLL is accompanied by decreased CXCR4 expression. Dissecting functional consequences of these alterations, we observed that tri12 CLL cell homing to murine BM is not affected by CXCR4-CXCL12 blockage using AMD3100 or olaptesed pegol/NOX-A12. In line, CCL21-CCR7 rather than CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions triggered VLA-4-mediated arrests of tri12 CLL cells to VCAM-1 under blood flow conditions. Concordantly, in real-time kinetic analyses we found CCL21 but not CXCL12 being capable to induce inside-out VLA-4 conformational changes in this CLL subgroup. Our results provide novel insights into the peculiar clinico-biological behaviour of tri12 CLL and emphasize its specific chemokine and integrin utilization during pathophysiologically and therapeutically relevant interactions with the microenvironmen.
ed migration activities of IFN-α- and IL-4-induced dendritic cells (IFN-DC and IL4-DC) generated from blood monocytes of healthy donors and analyzed migration activity of IFN-DC from patients with brain tumors. In the presence of CCL19 chemokine, donor IFN-DC exhibited higher migration activity than IL4-DC, the expression of chemokine CCR7-receptor being similar in the two cell types. IFN-DC of patients with malignant gliomas were characterized by low chemotaxis in response to CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation despite a trend to higher expression of CCR7 in comparison with donor IFN-D.
tory blockade with anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (mAb) plus donor-specific splenocyte transfusion (DST) induces alloantigen-specific tolerance. We previously showed that lymphotoxin signaling in the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) stromal subset was required for proper lymph node structure and function during tolerization in murine cardiac transplantation. Here we focused on FRC functions and hypothesized that DST and anti-CD40L mAb-modulated FRC interactions with CD4 T cells in mic.
 immunized or tolerized by DST or DST plus anti-CD40L mAb. Fibroblastic reticular cells were flow-sorted at different timepoints for characterization and in vitro proliferation and activation assay.
tic reticular cells responded rapidly to DST by transcribing inflammatory cytokine and chemokine messenger RNAs, such as CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL21. Conversely, anti-CD40L mAb inhibited FRC inflammatory responses. CD40 was expressed on FRC and agonistic anti-CD40 mAb activated FRC, which supported CD4 T-cell proliferation, whereas unstimulated FRC did not. Anti-CD3 mAb-activated CD4 T cells induced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expressions by FRC, which were inhibited by anti-CD40L mAb. Thus, FRC phenotype was altered by interaction with CD4 T cells through CD40-CD40L, and activated FRC interacted directly with CD4 T cells to support T cell activation and proliferation in vitr.
ether, these results demonstrated that CD40 on FRC facilitated bidirectional communication between FRC and CD4 T cells via CD40-CD40L, thereby altering FRC gene expression of immune regulatory molecules. Because blockade of CD40-CD40L interactions results in tolerance in mice, identification of FRC-T cell interactions provides a new research target for tolerance inductio.
kine C receptor 7 (CCR7) is a G-protein-coupled heptahelical receptor (GPCR) that is expressed on a wide variety of cells including memory T cells, B cells, mature dendritic cells, and cancer cells. Activated by its ligands CCL19 or CCL21, CCR7 plays a major role in metastasis of cancer cells. Recent studies demonstrated the role of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors in addition to let-7 microRNA in CCR7 expression. Our ChIP assays further show the binding of Sp-1, Sp-3 and NFAT-1 transcription factors to their potential binding sites in the 1Kb promoter region with the later found to inhibit whilst Sp-1, and Sp-3 were found to stimulate CCR7 expression as demonstrated by transfection assays. On the other hand, in addition to the known let-7 regulation of CCR7, we found miR-21 to have a highly conserved target region in CCR7 3'UTR and to be significantly down-regulated during the course of dendritic cell maturation, allowing for high expression of CCR.
-inducing factor, mitochondrion-associated 2 (Aifm2), is a DNA-binding oxoreductase protein that promotes apoptosis. To assess its potential role in erythropoiesis we analyzed the effects of Aifm2 loss-of-function in the murine erythroleukemia line (MEL.
 were transfected with siRNA targeting Aifm2 for 24 h and evaluated by cell counting, flow cytometry with annexin V and PI staining and gene expression analysi.
ckdown did not affect the apoptotic status of MEL cells. However, Aifm2 knockdown significantly increased expression of the erythropoietic transcription factor Klf1 (2.9±0.2-fold, p&lt;0.05) and decreased α- and β-globin expression (0.6±0.2-fold, p&lt;0.05 and 0.5±0.2-fold, p&lt;0.01.
 function in differentiation of erythroid MEL cells in vitr.
iesis, in which committed progenitor cells generate millions of erythrocytes daily, involves dramatic changes in the chromatin structure and transcriptome of erythroblasts, prior to their enucleation. While the involvement of the master-regulatory transcription factors GATA binding protein 1 (GATA-1) and GATA-2 in this process is established, the mechanistic contributions of many chromatin-modifying/remodeling enzymes in red cell biology remain enigmatic. We demonstrated that SetD8, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), is a context-dependent GATA-1 corepressor in erythroid cells. To determine whether SetD8 controls erythroid maturation and/or function, we used a small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based loss-of-function strategy in a primary murine erythroblast culture system. In this system, SetD8 promoted erythroblast maturation and survival, and this did not involve upregulation of the established regulator of erythroblast survival Bcl-x(L). SetD8 catalyzed H4K20me1 at a critical Gata2 cis element and restricted occupancy by an enhancer of Gata2 transcription, Scl/TAL1, thereby repressing Gata2 transcription. Elevating GATA-2 levels in erythroid precursors yielded a maturation block comparable to that induced by SetD8 downregulation. As lowering GATA-2 expression in the context of SetD8 knockdown did not rescue erythroid maturation, we propose that SetD8 regulation of erythroid maturation involves multiple target genes. These results establish SetD8 as a determinant of erythroid cell maturation and provide a framework for understanding how a broadly expressed histone-modifying enzyme mediates cell-type-specific GATA factor functio.
l expression of β-globin protein in mature erythrocytes is critically dependent on post-transcriptional events in erythroid progenitors that ensure the high stability of β-globin mRNA. Previous work has revealed that these regulatory processes require AUF-1 and YB-1, two RNA-binding proteins that assemble an mRNP β-complex on the β-globin 3'UTR. Here, we demonstrate that the β-complex organizes during the erythropoietic interval when both β-globin mRNA and protein accumulate rapidly, implicating the importance of this regulatory mRNP to normal erythroid differentiation. Subsequent functional analyses link β-complex assembly to the half-life of β-globin mRNA in vivo, providing a mechanistic basis for this regulatory activity. AUF-1 and YB-1 appear to serve a redundant post-transcriptional function, as both β-complex assembly and β-globin mRNA levels are reduced by coordinate depletion of the two factors, and can be restored by independent rescue with either factor alone. Additional studies demonstrate that the β-complex assembles more efficiently on polyadenylated transcripts, implicating a model in which the β-complex enhances the binding of PABPC1 to the poly(A) tail, inhibiting mRNA deadenylation and consequently effecting the high half-life of β-globin transcripts in erythroid progenitors. These data specify a post-transcriptional mechanism through which AUF1 and YB1 contribute to the normal development of erythropoietic cells, as well as to non-hematopoietic tissues in which AUF1- and YB1-based regulatory mRNPs have been observed to assemble on heterologous mRNA.
 is a process that leads to the degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components and long-lived protein aggregates. Erythropoiesis is a branch of hematopoietic differentiation by which mature red blood cells (RBCs) are generated from multi-potential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Autophagy plays a critical role in the elimination of mitochondria, ribosomes and other organelles during erythroid terminal differentiation. Here, the modulators of autophagy that regulate erythroid differentiation were summarized, including autophagy-related (Atg) genes, the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family member Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3-like (Nix/Binp3L), transcription factors globin transcription factor 1 (GATA1) and forkhead box O3 (FoxO3), intermediary factor KRAB-associated protein1 (KAP1), and other modulators, such as focal adhesion kinase family-interacting protein of 200-kDa (FIP200), Ca2+ and 15-lipoxygenase. Understanding the modulators of autophagy in erythropoiesis will benefit the autophagy research field and facilitate the prevention and treatment of autophagy-related red blood cell disorder.
Ter119 combination has been widely used to reflect dynamic maturation of erythrocytes in vivo. However, because CD71 is expressed on all proliferating cells, it is unclear whether it can be utilized as an erythrocyte-specific marker during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In this study, we revealed that a population expressing high level of CD71 (CD71(high)) during mouse ESC differentiation represented an in vitro counterpart of yolk sac-derived primitive erythroblasts (EryPs) isolated at 8.5days post coitum. In addition, these CD71(high) cells went through &quot;maturational globin switching&quot; and enucleated during terminal differentiation in vitro that were similar to the yolk sac-derived EryPs in vivo. We further demonstrated that the formation of CD71(high) population was regulated differentially by key factors including Scl, HoxB4, Eaf1, and Klf1. Taken together, our study provides a technical advance that allows efficient segregation of EryPs from differentiated ESCs in vitro for further understanding molecular regulation during primitive erythropoiesi.
ctor independence 1 (Gfi-1) is a part of the transcriptional network that regulates the development of adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Gfi-1-null (Gfi-1(-/-)) mice have reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), impaired radioprotective function of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), and myeloid and erythroid hyperplasia. We found that the development of HPCs and erythropoiesis, but not HSC function, was rescued by reducing the expression of inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 2 (Id2) in Gfi-1(-/-) mice. Analysis of Gfi-1(-/-);Id2(+/-) mice revealed that short-term HSCs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), erythroid burst-forming units, colony-forming units in spleen, and more differentiated red cells were partially restored by reducing Id2 levels in Gfi-1(-/-) mice. Moreover, short-term reconstituting cells, and, to a greater extent, CMP and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor development, and red blood cell production (anemia) were rescued in mice transplanted with Gfi-1(-/-);Id2(+/-) bone marrow cells (BMCs) in comparison with Gfi-1(-/-) BMCs. Reduction of Id2 expression in Gfi-1(-/-) mice increased the expression of Gata1, Eklf, and EpoR, which are required for proper erythropoiesis. Reducing the levels of other Id family members (Id1 and Id3) in Gfi-1(-/-) mice did not rescue impaired HPC function or erythropoiesis. These data provide new evidence that Gfi-1 is linked to the erythroid gene regulatory network by repressing Id2 expressio.
evidence has shown that microRNAs have key roles in regulating various normal physiological processes, whereas their deregulated expression is correlated with various diseases. The miR-146 family includes miR-146a and miR-146b, with a distinct expression spectrum in different hematopoietic cells. Recent work indicated that miR-146a has a close relationship with inflammation and autoimmune diseases. miR-146-deficient mice have developed some abnormal hematopoietic phenotypes, suggesting the potential functions of miR-146 in hematopoietic development. In this study, we found that miR-146b was consistently up-regulated in both K562 and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergoing either erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation. Remarkably, erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation of K562 cells was induced by excess miR-146b but inhibited by decreased miR-146b levels. More importantly, an mRNA encoding receptor tyrosine kinase, namely platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA), was identified and validated as a direct target of miR-146b in hematopoietic cells. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that PDGFRA functioned as a negative regulator in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. miR-146b could ultimately affect the expression of the GATA-1 gene, which is regulated by HEY1 (Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1), a transcriptional repressor, via inhibition of the PDGFRA/JNK/JUN/HEY1 pathway. Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer also demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-146b promoted erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis of HSPCs via its regulation on the PDGFRA gene and effects on GATA-1 expression. Moreover, we confirmed that the binding of GATA-1 to the miR-146b promoter and induction of miR-146b during hematopoietic maturation were dependent on GATA-1. Therefore, miR-146b, PDGFRA, and GATA-1 formed a regulatory circuit to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiatio.
ted differentiation toward erythroid (E) or megakaryocytic (MK) lineages by the MK-E progenitor (MEP) could enhance the ex vivo generation of red blood cells and platelets for therapeutic transfusions. The lineage choice at the MEP bifurcation is controlled in large part by activity within the intracellular signal transduction network, the output of which determines the activity of transcription factors (TFs) and ultimately gene expression. Although many TFs have been implicated, E or MK differentiation is a complex process requiring multiple days, and the dynamics of TF activities during commitment and terminal maturation are relatively unexplored. Herein, we applied a living cell array for the large-scale, dynamic quantification of TF activities during MEP bifurcation. A panel of hematopoietic TFs (GATA-1, GATA-2, SCL/TAL1, FLI-1, NF-E2, PU.1, c-Myb) was characterized during E and MK differentiation of bipotent K562 cells. Dynamic TF activity profiles associated with differentiation towards each lineage were identified, and validated with previous reports. From these activity profiles, we show that GATA-1 is an important hub during early hemin- and PMA-induced differentiation, and reveal several characteristic TF interactions for E and MK differentiation that confirm regulatory mechanisms documented in the literature. Additionally, we highlight several novel TF interactions at various stages of E and MK differentiation. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism by which nicotinamide (NIC) promoted terminal MK maturation using an MK-committed cell line, CHRF-288-11 (CHRF). Concomitant with its enhancement of ploidy, NIC strongly enhanced the activity of three TFs with known involvement in terminal MK maturation: FLI-1, NF-E2, and p53. Dynamic profiling of TF activity represents a novel tool to complement traditional assays focused on mRNA and protein expression levels to understand progenitor cell differentiatio.
 Cbfβ are critical for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and are implicated in leukemic transformation. Despite the absolute requirements for these factors in the development of hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes, their roles in the development of bone marrow progenitor subsets have not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that Cbfβ is essential for the development of Flt3(+) macrophage-dendritic cell (DC) progenitors in the bone marrow and all DC subsets in the periphery. Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression of Irf8 restors DC differentiation. These results demonstrate that Runx proteins and Cbfβ restrict granulocyte lineage commitment to facilitate multilineage hematopoietic differentiation and thus identify their novel tumor suppressor function in myeloid leukemi.
se of this study was to examine the gene expression profile of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood (mPB)-derived progenitors, used in transplantatio.
ated gene expression patterns of highly enriched steady-state peripheral blood (PB)- and mPB-derived CD71+ cells by microarray and ingenuity pathway analyses, to identify the transcriptional program during in vitro erythroid differentiatio.
expression was more than doubled in mPB-derived (4180 genes) compared to PB-derived erythroid progenitors (1667 genes) while PB-and mPB-derived erythroid progenitors shared 1534 common genes. Comparative analysis of transcript levels showed differential expression of 54 genes between cultured erythroid progenitors of PB and mPB origin, where we identified common 13 downregulated and 30 upregulated genes. The most significant genes in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors were P4HB, DDIA3, ARPC2 and ATP5G3. Regarding G-CSF stimulation the G-CSF receptor CSF2RB (1.1-fold) was linked via STAT3 to erythroid-specific ALAS2 (2.9-fold) and GATA2 (1.3-fold) factors, all upregulated in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors, coupled to common upregulated NUDC gene involved in the proliferation of erythroid cell.
rt provides an extensive transcriptional profile of cultured erythroid progenitors and leads to a better understanding of diversity among the progenitor source.
scription factor family members GATA1 and GATA2 play crucial roles in the regulation of lineage-restricted genes during erythroid differentiation. GATA1 is indispensable for survival and terminal differentiation of erythroid, megakaryocytic and eosinophilic progenitors, whereas GATA2 regulates proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Expression levels of GATA1 and GATA2 are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level through auto- and reciprocal regulatory networks formed by these GATA factors. The dynamic and strictly controlled change of expression from GATA2 to GATA1 during erythropoiesis has been referred to as GATA factor switching, which plays a crucial role in erythropoiesis. The regulatory network comprising GATA1 and GATA2 gives rise to the stage-specific changes in Gata1 and Gata2 gene expression during erythroid differentiation, which ensures specific expression of early and late erythroid genes at each stage. Recent studies have also shed light on the genome-wide binding profiles of GATA1 and GATA2, and the significance of epigenetic modification of Gata1 gene during erythroid differentiation. This review summarizes the current understanding of network regulation underlying stage-dependent Gata1 and Gata2 gene expressions and the functional contribution of these GATA factors in erythroid differentiatio.
itting demand to replenish differentiated cells in tissues requires efficient mechanisms to generate and regulate stem and progenitor cells. Although master regulatory transcription factors, including GATA binding protein-2 (GATA-2), have crucial roles in these mechanisms, how such factors are controlled in developmentally dynamic systems is poorly understood. Previously, we described five dispersed Gata2 locus sequences, termed the -77, -3.9, -2.8, -1.8, and +9.5 GATA switch sites, which contain evolutionarily conserved GATA motifs occupied by GATA-2 and GATA-1 in hematopoietic precursors and erythroid cells, respectively. Despite common attributes of transcriptional enhancers, targeted deletions of the -2.8, -1.8, and +9.5 sites revealed distinct and unpredictable contributions to Gata2 expression and hematopoiesis. Herein, we describe the targeted deletion of the -3.9 site and mechanistically compare the -3.9 site with other GATA switch sites. The -3.9(-/-) mice were viable and exhibited normal Gata2 expression and steady-state hematopoiesis in the embryo and adult. We established a Gata2 repression/reactivation assay, which revealed unique +9.5 site activity to mediate GATA factor-dependent chromatin structural transitions. Loss-of-function analyses provided evidence for a mechanism in which a mediator of long-range transcriptional control [LIM domain binding 1 (LDB1)] and a chromatin remodeler [Brahma related gene 1 (BRG1)] synergize through the +9.5 site, conferring expression of GATA-2, which is known to promote the genesis and survival of hematopoietic stem cell.
 (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play important roles in normal hematopoiesis, including erythropoiesis. Although studies have identified several miRNAs that regulate erythroid commitment and differentiation, we do not understand the mechanism by which the crucial erythroid transcription factors, GATA-1and NF-E2 directly regulate and control differentiation via miRNA pathways. In this study, we identified miR-199b-5p as a key regulator of human erythropoiesis, and its expression was up-regulated during the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Furthermore, the increase of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells occurred in a GATA-1- and NF-E2-dependent manner during erythrocyte maturation. Both GATA-1 and NF-E2 bound upstream of the miR-199b gene locus and activated its transcription. Forced expression of miRNA-199b-5p in K562 cells affected erythroid cell proliferation and maturation. Moreover, we identified c-Kit as a direct target of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells. Taken together, our results establish a functional link among the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1/NF-E2, miR-199b-5p and c-Kit, and provide new insights into the coupling of transcription and post-transcription regulation in erythroid differentiatio.
criptional regulators of terminal erythropoiesis, such as GATA-binding factor 1 (GATA1) and T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1), have been well characterized, but transcription factors and cofactors and their expression modulations have not yet been explored on a global scale. Here, we use global gene expression analysis to identify 28 transcription factors and 19 transcriptional cofactors induced during terminal erythroid differentiation whose promoters are enriched for binding by GATA1 and TAL1. Utilizing protein-protein interaction databases to identify cofactors for each transcription factor, we pinpoint several co-induced pairs, of which E2f2 and its cofactor transcription factor Dp-2 (Tfdp2) were the most highly induced. TFDP2 is a critical cofactor required for proper cell cycle control and gene expression. GATA1 and TAL1 are bound to the regulatory regions of Tfdp2 and upregulate its expression and knockdown of Tfdp2 results in significantly reduced rates of proliferation as well as reduced upregulation of many erythroid-important genes. Loss of Tfdp2 also globally inhibits the normal downregulation of many E2F2 target genes, including those that regulate the cell cycle, causing cells to accumulate in S phase and resulting in increased erythrocyte size. Our findings highlight the importance of TFDP2 in coupling the erythroid cell cycle with terminal differentiation and validate this study as a resource for future work on elucidating the role of diverse transcription factors and coregulators in erythropoiesi.
 states are highly cell-type-specific, but the underlying mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of their genome-wide patterns remain poorly understood. Here we present a computational approach for investigation of chromatin-state plasticity. We applied this approach to investigate an ENCODE ChIP-seq dataset profiling the genome-wide distributions of the H3K27me3 mark in 19 human cell lines. We found that the high plasticity regions (HPRs) can be divided into two functionally and mechanistically distinct subsets, which correspond to CpG island (CGI) proximal or distal regions, respectively. Although the CGI proximal HPRs are typically associated with continuous variation across different cell-types, the distal HPRs are associated with binary-like variations. We developed a computational approach to predict putative cell-type-specific modulators of H3K27me3 patterns and validated the predictions by comparing with public ChIP-seq data. Furthermore, we applied this approach to investigate mechanisms for poised enhancer establishment in primary human erythroid precursors. Importantly, we predicted and experimentally validated that the principal hematopoietic regulator T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (TAL1) is involved in regulating H3K27me3 variations in collaboration with the transcription factor growth factor independent 1B (GFI1B), providing fresh insights into the context-specific role of TAL1 in erythropoiesis. Our approach is generally applicable to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of epigenetic pathways in establishing cellular identit.
n (IFN)-γ is a proinflammatory cytokine that is linked to erythropoiesis inhibition and may contribute to anemia. However, the mechanism of IFN-γ-inhibited erythropoiesis is unknown. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily, induces the erythropoiesis of hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this study, a luciferase reporter assay showed that IFN-γ suppressed activin A-induced ζ-globin promoter activation in K562 erythroblast cells in a dose-dependent manner. Activin A reversed the suppressive effect of IFN-γ on the luciferase activity of ζ-globin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-γ also suppressed the activation of activin A-induced α-globin promoter. IFN-γ reduced the mRNA expression of α-globin, ζ-globin, NF-E2p45, and GATA-1 induced by activin A. The results also showed that IFN-γ induced c-Jun expression when NF-κBp65 and c-Jun bound to two AP-1-binding sites on the c-Jun promoter. The luciferase activity of α-globin and ζ-globin promoters were enhanced by wild-type c-Jun and eliminated by dominant-negative (DN) c-Jun. The suppressive effects of IFN-γ on the mRNA expression of α-globin and ζ-globin were absent in cells expressing DN c-Jun. The ability of NF-E2 to enhance activin A-induced ζ-globin promoter activation decreased when c-Jun was present, and IFN-γ treatment further enhanced the decreasing effect of c-Jun. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that NF-E2p45 bound to the upstream regulatory element (HS-40) of the α-globin gene cluster in response to activin A, whereas c-Jun eliminated this binding. These results suggest that IFN-γ modulates NF-κB/c-Jun to antagonize activin A-mediated NF-E2 transcriptional activity on globin gene expressio.
s characterized as an excess accumulation of body fat resulting from a positive energy balance. It is the major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). The evidence for familial aggregation of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases is substantial. To date, about 150 genetic loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are linked with obesity and T2D, each accounting for only a small proportion of the predicted heritability. However, the percentage of overall trait variance explained by these associated loci is modest (~5-10% for T2D, ~2% for BMI). The lack of powerful genetic associations suggests that heritability is not entirely attributable to gene variations. Some of the familial aggregation as well as many of the effects of environmental exposures, may reflect epigenetic processes. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the genetic basis to individual risk of obesity and T2D, and explores the potential role of epigenetic contributio.
on of the genetic pathways that control red blood cell development has been a central goal of erythropoiesis research over the past decade. Notably, data from several recent studies have provided new insights into the regulation of erythroid gene transcription. Transcription profiling demonstrates that erythropoiesis is mainly controlled by a small group of lineage-restricted transcription factors [Gata binding protein 1 (Gata1), T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 protein (Tal1), and Erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF; henceforth referred to as Klf1)]. Binding-site mapping using ChIP-Seq indicates that most DNA-bound Gata1 and Tal1 proteins are contained within higher order complexes (Ldb1 complexes) that include the nuclear adapters Ldb1 and Lmo2. Ldb1 complexes regulate Klf1, and Ldb1 complex-binding sites frequently colocalize with Klf1 at erythroid genes and cis-regulatory elements, indicating strong functional synergy between Gata1, Tal1, and Klf1. Together with new data demonstrating that Ldb1 can mediate long-range promoter-enhancer interactions, these findings provide a foundation for the first comprehensive models of the global regulation of erythroid gene transcriptio.
subunit of the Mediator transcriptional coregulator complex coactivates GATA1 and induces erythropoiesis. Here, we show the dual mechanism of GATA1- and MED1-mediated transcription. MED1 expression levels in K562 erythroleukemia cells paralleled the levels of GATA1-targeted gene transcription and erythroid differentiation. An N-terminal fragment of MED1, MED1(1-602), which is incapable of interacting with GATA1, enhanced GATA1-targeted gene transcription and erythroid differentiation, and introduction of MED1(1-602) into Med1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) partially rescued GATA1-mediated transcription. The C-terminal zinc-finger domain of GATA1 interacts with the MED1(1-602)-interacting coactivator CCAR1, CoCoA and MED1(681-715). CCAR1 and CoCoA synergistically enhanced GATA1-mediated transcription from the γ-globin promoter in MEFs. Recombinant GATA1, CCAR1, CoCoA and MED1(1-602) formed a complex in vitro, and GATA1, CCAR1, CoCoA and MED1 were recruited to the γ-globin promoter in K562 cells during erythroid differentiation. Therefore, in addition to the direct interaction between GATA1 and MED1, CoCoA and CCAR1 appear to relay the GATA1 signal to MED1, and multiple modes of the GATA1-MED1 axis may help to fine-tune GATA1 function during GATA1-mediated homeostasis event.
is best known as the key molecule in intracellular iron storage, and is involved in several metabolic processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and neoplastic transformation. We have recently demonstrated that the shRNA silencing of the ferritin heavy subunit (FHC) in a melanoma cell line is accompanied by a consistent modification of gene expression pattern leading to a reduced potential in terms of proliferation, invasiveness, and adhesion ability of the silenced cells. In this study we sought to define the repertoire of genes whose expression might be affected by FHC during the hemin-induced differentiation of the erythromyeloid cell line K562. To this aim, gene expression profiling was performed in four different sets of cells: i) wild type K562; ii) sh-RNA FHC-silenced K562; iii) hemin-treated wild-type K562; and iv) hemin-treated FHC-silenced K562. Statistical analysis of the gene expression data, performed by two-factor ANOVA, identified three distinct classes of transcripts: a) Class 1, including 657 mRNAs whose expression is modified exclusively during hemin-induced differentiation of K562 cells, independently from the FHC relative amounts; b) Class 2, containing a set of 70 mRNAs which are consistently modified by hemin and FHC-silencing; and c) Class 3, including 128 transcripts modified by FHC-silencing but not by hemin. Our data indicate that FHC may function as a modulator of gene expression during erythroid differentiation and add new findings to the knowledge of the complex gene network modulated during erythroid differentiatio.
ous studies showed that some nuclear proteins that were expressed especially during terminal differentiation of erythroid cells might interact directly or indirectly with HS2 sequence to form the HS2-protein complexes and thus play an important role in the globin gene regulation and erythroid differentiation. Monoclonal antibodies against the nuclear proteins of terminal differentiated erythroid cells, including intermediate and late erythroblasts of human fetal liver and hemin induced K562 cells, were prepared by hybridoma technique. The monoclonal antibodies were used to screen lambda-gtll human cDNA expression library of fetal liver in order to obtain the relevant cDNA clones. By the analysis of their cDNA clones and the identification of the proteins' functions, the regulation mechanism of the HS2 binding proteins might be better understood. Two cDNA clones (GenBank accession number AF040247 and AF040248 respectively) were obtained and one of them owns a full length and the other encodes a protein characterized by a leucine-zipper domain. Both of them were expressed differentially in K562 cells and hemin-induced K562 cells. The evidence suggested that both of them were involved in erythroid differentiation. We investigated the expression pattern ofEDRF1 andEDRF2 by RT-PCR technique. The results of RT-PCR suggested that EDRF1 and EDRF2 might play a critical role in early stage of organ development and histological differentiation. EDRF1 and EDRF2 might start the program of erythroid development, and also regulate the development of erythroid tissue and the expression of globin gene at different stage of the developmen.
ous studies showed that EDRF1 influenced expression of alpha-globin mRNA and synthesis of hemoglobin in K562 cells and modulated self-renewal of K562 cells. To illuminate the function of EDRF1 in K562 cells, sense and antisense EDRF1 constructs were prepared and transfected into K562 cells. By using microarray and dot blot assay, 60 cytokine receptors and some oncogenes sharing important functions in cell proliferation and differentiation were investigated. The results of this study demonstrated that IL-6 receptor, GM-CSF receptor, c-Jun/c-Fos, c-Myc and c-kit genes were regulated by antisense EDRF1 expression. The regulation was confirmed by RNA blot assay. GATA-1 mRNA expression was modulated by EDRF1 gene transfection. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 was remarkably inhibited in K562 cells expressing EDRF1 antisense gene. DNA binding activity of NF-E2 was at the same level as control experiment. Therefore EDRF1 may play a role in erythroid proliferation and differentiation by affecting the interaction between GATA-1 and its cis-element.
 differentiation depends on the establishment of specific patterns of gene expression. Hypersensitive site 2 (HS2, serving as a major enhancer of globin genes)-binding proteins may be involved in its natural open chromosomal environment formation. Previously we prepared monoclonal antibodies against HS2-binding nuclear proteins of terminal differentiated erythroid cells. By utilizing the monoclonal antibodies, we screened lambda-gt11 human fetal liver cDNA expression library and obtained one cDNA clone, which was named erythroid differentiation related gene (EDRF1, Genbank accession number AF040247), encompassing an entire open reading frame. We investigated the expression pattern of EDRF1 by RT-PCR technique. And a clue to the function of EDRF1 has been found from confirmation of high levels of EDRF1 mRNA in differentiated K562 and human fetal liver tissue. To illuminate the function of EDRF1 in K562 cells, sense and antisense EDRF1 constructs were prepared and transfected into K562 cells. alpha-globin mRNA was down-regulated and EpoR (erythropoietin receptor) mRNA expression was increased in antisense transfected cells. Cells transfected with sense construct grew more slowly than control cells suggested by [(3)H] thimidine incorporation experiments. Suppression of K562 proliferation was accompanied by increased spontaneous hemoglobin synthesis demonstrated by spectrometry. K562 cells transfected with sense construct exhibited reduced clongenicity compared with control cells in methycellulose culture. These data provided the evidence that EDRF1 can influence globin expression and hemoglobin synthesis in K562 cells and modulated self-renewal in K562 cell.
e the differentiation-inducing properties of the novel erythroid differentiation related gene EDRF1, and demonstrate its functioning pathway involved in regulation of alpha- and gamma-globin gene expressio.
se and antisense constructs were transfected into HEL cells, then the expression of globin and erythropoietin receptor gene was identified by Northern blot analysis. RT-PCR and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) were carried out to monitor the expression and DNA-binding activity of erythroid specific transcription factor GATA-1 and NF-E.
lls with transfection of sense expression carrier, the experssion of EDRF1 mRNA was upregulated. In HEL cells with transfection of antisense expression carrier, the experession of EDRF1 mRNA was downregulated. In HEL cells with overexpression of EDRF1, production of alpha-globin was increased. In antisense EDRF1 overexpressed HEL cells, significant loss of alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA synthesis was observed. The expression of erythropoietin receptor was unchanged in HEL cells transfected with EDRF1 sense and antisense expression carriers. No significant change was found in expression of transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 in HEL cells transfected with empty carrier, sense expression carrier, and antisense expression carrier. However, the transcription activity of GATA-1 was severely impaired. Expression of erythropoietin receptor gene was not influenced by EDRF1 gene overexpressio.
ulates alpha- and gamma-globin gene synthesis by modulating DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 transcription factor. Overexpression and underexpression of EDRF1 do not significantly regulate the expression of GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA. Monitoring the EPOR signal pathway is not the mechanism by which EDRF1 influences the differentiation of erythrocyt.
r characterize the differentiation inducing properties of EDRF1 and demonstrate its functional pathway involved in regulation of globin gene expressio.
ecting EDRF1 sense and antisense constructs into HEL cells, we identified the expression of globin and erythropoietin receptor genes by Northern blot analysis. RT-PCR and EMSA (electrophoresis mobility shift assay) were performed to monitor the expression and DNA-binding activity of erythroid specific transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E.
own that when EDRF1 was overexpressed, production of alpha-globin increased. In antisense EDRF1, overexpression of HEL cells, significant loss of alpha-, gamma-globin mRNA synthesis was observed. The transcription of endogenous GATA-1 and NF-E2 mRNA expression were maintained at the same levels compared with control experiments. However, the transcription activity of GATA-1 was severely impaired. Expression of erythropoietin receptor gene was not influenced by EDRF1 gene overexpressio.
ts suggested that EDRF1 regulated alpha- and gamma-globin gene synthesis by modulating DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 transcription facto.
idence shows that nitric oxide (NO) may exhibit both pro-cancer and anti-cancer activities. The present study aimed to determine the differentially expressed proteins in NO-treated NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in order to investigate whether NO induces proteins with pro-cancer or anti-cancer effect.
 were treated with 300 μM of an NO donor 3,3-bis-(aminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene (NOC-18) for 12 h. The changed protein patterns, which were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis using pH gradients of 4-7, were conclusively identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of the peptide digest.
 differentially expressed proteins were identified in NOC-18-treated cells. Nine proteins [vinculin protein, keratin 19, ubiquitous tropomodulin, F-actin capping protein (α1 subunit), tropomyosin 3, 26S proteasome-associated pad1 homolog, T-complex protein 1 (ε subunit) N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, and heat shock protein 90] were increased and eight proteins (heat shock protein 70, glucosidase II, lamin B1, calreticulin, nucleophosmin 1, microtubule-associated protein retinitis pigmentosa/end binding family member 1, 150 kD oxygen-regulated protein precursor, and heat shock 70-related protein albino or pale green 2) were decreased by NOC-18 in the cells. Thirteen proteins are related to the suppression of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis while two proteins (heat shock protein 90 and N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase) are related to carcinogenesis. The functions of 150 kD oxygen-regulated protein precursor and T-complex protein 1 (ε subunit) are unknown in relation to carcinogenesi.
eins differentially expressed by NOC-18 are involved in inhibiting cancer developmen.
f array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool in molecular genetics has facilitated the identification of many new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (MMSs). Furthermore, this method has allowed for the identification of copy number variations (CNVs) whose pathogenic role has yet to be uncovered. Here, we report on our application of array CGH for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in 79 Russian children with intellectual disability (ID). Twenty-six pathogenic or likely pathogenic changes in copy number were detected in 22 patients (28%): 8 CNVs corresponded to known MMSs, and 17 were not associated with previously described syndromes. In this report, we describe our findings and comment on genes potentially associated with ID that are located within the CNV region.
esions are intricate protein complexes that facilitate cell attachment, migration, and cellular communication. Lasp-2 (LIM-nebulette), a member of the nebulin family of actin-binding proteins, is a newly identified component of these complexes. To gain further insights into the functional role of lasp-2, we identified two additional binding partners of lasp-2: the integral focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin. Of interest, the interaction of lasp-2 with its binding partners vinculin and paxillin is significantly reduced in the presence of lasp-1, another nebulin family member. The presence of lasp-2 appears to enhance the interaction of vinculin and paxillin with each other; however, as with the interaction of lasp-2 with vinculin or paxillin, this effect is greatly diminished in the presence of excess lasp-1. This suggests that the interplay between lasp-2 and lasp-1 could be an adhesion regulatory mechanism. Lasp-2's potential role in metastasis is revealed, as overexpression of lasp-2 in either SW620 or PC-3B1 cells-metastatic cancer cell lines-increases cell migration but impedes cell invasion, suggesting that the enhanced interaction of vinculin and paxillin may functionally destabilize focal adhesion composition. Taken together, these data suggest that lasp-2 has an important role in coordinating and regulating the composition and dynamics of focal adhesion.
ine-rich protein (CRP) family is a subgroup of LIM domain proteins. CRP1, which cross-links actin filaments to make actin bundles, is the only CRP family member expressed in the CNS with little known about its function in nerve cells. Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of CRP1 expression by short hairpin RNA interference results in inhibition of filopodia formation and dendritic growth in neurons. Overexpression of CRP1 increases filopodia formation and neurite branching, which require its actin-bundling activity. Expression of CRP1 with a constitutively active form of Cdc42, a GTPase involved in filopodia formation, increases filopodia formation in COS-7 cells, suggesting cooperation between the two proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that neuronal activity upregulates CRP1 expression in hippocampal neurons via Ca²⁺ influx after depolarization. Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and cAMP response element binding protein mediate the Ca²⁺-induced upregulation of CRP1 expression. Furthermore, CRP1 is required for the dendritic growth induced by Ca²⁺ influx or CaMKIV. Together, these data are the first to demonstrate a role for CRP1 in dendritic growt.
an actin-binding, signaling pathway-regulated phosphoprotein that is overexpressed in several cancers. siRNA knockdown in cell lines retards cell migration, suggesting the possibility that Lasp1 upregulation influences cancer metastasis. Herein, we utilized a recently developed gene knockout model to assess the role of Lasp1 in modulating nontransformed cell functions. Wound healing and tumor initiation progressed more rapidly in Lasp1(-/-) mice compared with Lasp1(+/+) controls. Embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Lasp1(-/-) mice also migrated more rapidly in vitro. These MEFs characteristically possessed increased focal adhesion numbers and displayed more rapid attachment compared with wild-type MEFs. Differential microarray analyses revealed alterations in message expression for proteins implicated in cell migration, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization. Notably, the focal adhesion protein, lipoma preferred partner (LPP), a zyxin family member and putative Lasp1 binding protein, was increased about twofold. Because LPP gene disruption reduces cell migration, we hypothesize that LPP plays a role in enhancing the migratory capacity of Lasp1(-/-) MEFs, perhaps by modifying the subcellular localization of other motility-associated proteins. The striking contrast in the functional effects of loss of Lasp1 in innate cells compared with cell lines reveals distinct differences in mechanisms of motility and attachment in these model.
er protein 185 (ZFP185), which contains a conservative Lin-l 1, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM) domain at its C-terminus, is a member of mouse LIM protein family. Although brahma-related gene 1(BRG1), the upstream regulation gene of ZFP185, is essential in the development and activation of T lymphocytes, there is no report on the involvement of ZFP185 in lymphocyte activation. The expression of ZFP185 protein was up-regulated significantly in T lymphocytes during their activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin, compared with non-activated T lymphocytes, as determined by western blot assays. However, over-expression of ZFP185 in EL4 cells showed no significant effect on the cell proliferation. Importantly, expression of ZFP185-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein in EL4 cells showed that ZFP185 uniquely localized in the uropod of lymphocytes as observed with a two-photon laser scanning confocal microscope. The direct interaction between ZFP185 and actin was supported by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. The special distribution of ZFP185 in uropod indicates the potential involvement of ZFP185 in T-cell morphology and movemen.
in family of actin-binding proteins plays an important role in actin filament dynamics in a variety of cells including striated muscle. We report here the identification of a new striated muscle Z-disc associated protein: lasp-2 (LIM and SH3 domain protein-2). Lasp-2 is the most recently identified member of the nebulin family. To evaluate the role of lasp-2 in striated muscle, lasp-2 gene expression and localization were studied in chick and mouse tissue, as well as in primary cultures of chick cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Lasp-2 mRNA was detected as early as chick embryonic stage 25 and lasp-2 protein was associated with developing premyofibril structures, Z-discs of mature myofibrils, focal adhesions, and intercalated discs of cultured cardiomyocytes. Expression of GFP-tagged lasp-2 deletion constructs showed that the C-terminal region of lasp-2 is important for its localization in striated muscle cells. Lasp-2 organizes actin filaments into bundles and interacts directly with the Z-disc protein alpha-actinin. These results are consistent with a function of lasp-2 as a scaffolding and actin filament organizing protein within striated muscle Z-disc.
n proteins were demonstrated to play key roles in various biological processes such as embryonic development, cell lineage determination, and cancer differentiation. Actin binding LIM protein 1 (abLIM1) was reported to be localized in a genomic region often deleted in human cancers and suggested to be involved in axon guidance. Recently, existence of a second family member was reported, actin binding LIM protein 2. By means of computational biology and comparative genomics, we now characterized an additional, third member of the actin binding LIM protein subgroup, actin binding LIM protein 3 (abLIM3). The human mRNA sequence was previously annotated as differentially regulated in hepatoblastoma compared to normal livers. Conservation of key structural features of abLIM1 and abLIM2, four LIM domains and a VHD domain, suggested comparable biological function of abLIM3 as a linker between actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways. AbLIM3 was found to be conserved in vertebrates, as orthologous sequences were characterized for mouse, fish, and frog. In addition, we report the existence of abLIM2 orthologs in fish and frog, suggesting a similar degree of evolutionary conservation. The intracellular localization of the abLIM3 protein was predicted to be nuclear by means of Reinhardt's neural network and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The corresponding abLIM3 gene was localized to chromosome 5q32 and spanned 119 kb, organized in 24 exons. An RT-PCR based expression profile available from the human unidentified gene-encoded (HUGE) database demonstrated highest expression for abLIM3 in heart, lung, liver, and brain/cerebellum accompanied by lower expression in multiple other tissues. Furthermore, abLIM3 was expressed in fetal liver, CNS, and spinal cor.
f the ALP/Enigma family of PDZ-LIM proteins play a role in cytoskeletal anchorage and mutations in at least one member of this family are associated with human cardiomyopathy. Here, we describe the analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans alp-1 gene. alp-1 is predicted to encode the entire nematode ALP/Enigma protein family, consisting of one ALP-related protein with a single LIM domain and three Enigma-like proteins containing four LIM domains. We demonstrate that the ALP-1 proteins are expressed in muscle cells, where they localize to actin anchorage and muscle attachment sites. We show that the PDZ domain of the ALP-1 proteins is sufficient to target the protein to the dense bodies, which are important actin anchorage sites in C. elegans body wall muscle. We demonstrate that the C. elegans ALP/Enigma proteins are also localized to cell-cell junctions and to both epithelial and muscle cell nuclei. These findings suggest new roles for the ALP/Enigma protein family that may lead to the understanding of their involvement in cardiomyopath.
g evidence for the contractile nature of fish branchial pillar cells was provided by demonstrating the presence of actin fibers and a novel four-and-a-half LIM (FHL) protein in which expression is specific for contractile tissues and sensitive to the tension applied to the pillar cell. When eel gill sections were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, a selective fluorescent probe for fibrous actin, a strong bundle-like staining was observed around collagen columns in pillar cells, suggesting the presence of abundant actin fibers. A cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the actin-binding FHL family, FHL5, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library of eel gill. Northern analysis revealed that FHL5 mRNA is highly expressed only in gills, heart, and skeletal muscle. In gills, FHL5 was found to be confined to pillar cells by immunohistochemistry. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that FHL5 is present in both cytosol and nucleus; within the cytosol, a large portion of FHL5 is colocalized with the phalloidin-positive actin bundles. Furthermore, transfection of myogenic C2C12 cells with FHL5 cDNA demonstrated, in addition to its interaction with actin stress fibers, a nuclear shuttling activity of FHL5. The mRNA and protein levels were found to be elevated on 1) transfer of eels from seawater to freshwater, 2) volume expansion by infusion of isotonic dextran-saline, and 3) constriction of gill vasculature by bolus injection of endothelin-1. These results suggest contractile nature of pillar cells and a role of FHL5 in maintaining the integrity and regulating the dynamics of pillar cell.
 member of the Rho family of small molecular mass GTPases that act as molecular switches to control actin-based cell morphology as well as cell growth and differentiation. Rac1 and Rac2 are specifically required for superoxide formation by components of the NADPH oxidase. In binding assays, Rac1 interacts directly with p67(phox), but not with the other oxidase components: cytochrome b, p40(phox), or p47(phox) (Prigmore, E., Ahmed, S., Best, A., Kozma, R. , Manser, E., Segal, A. W., and Lim, L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 10717-10722). Here, the Rac1/2 interaction with p67(phox) has been characterized further. Rac1 and Rac2 can bind to p67(phox) amino acid residues 170-199, and the N terminus (amino acids 1-192) of p67(phox) can be used as a specific inhibitor of Rac signaling. Deletion of p67(phox) C-terminal sequences (amino acids 193-526), the C-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 470-526), or the polyproline-rich motif (amino acids 226-236) stimulates Rac1 binding by approximately 8-fold. p21(Cdc42Hs/Rac)-activated kinase (PAK) phosphorylates p67(phox) amino acid residues adjacent to the Rac1/2-binding site, and this phosphorylation is stimulated by deletion of the C-terminal SH3 domain or the polyproline-rich motif. These data suggest a role for cryptic Rac-binding and PAK phosphorylation sites of p67(phox) in control of the NADPH oxidas.
on to regulating cell motility, contractility, and cytokinesis, the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the regulation of transcription and gene expression. We have previously identified a novel muscle-specific actin-binding protein, STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signaling), which directly binds actin and stimulates serum-response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription. To further dissect the STARS/SRF pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library using STARS as bait, and we identified two novel members of the ABLIM protein family, ABLIM-2 and -3, as STARS-interacting proteins. ABLIM-1, which is expressed in retina, brain, and muscle tissue, has been postulated to function as a tumor suppressor. ABLIM-2 and -3 display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns with the highest expression levels in muscle and neuronal tissue. Moreover, these novel ABLIM proteins strongly bind F-actin, are localized to actin stress fibers, and synergistically enhance STARS-dependent activation of SRF. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ABLIM expression utilizing small interfering RNA significantly blunted SRF-dependent transcription in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. These findings suggest that the members of the novel ABLIM protein family may serve as a scaffold for signaling modules of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby modulate transcriptio.
intron structures of the human, rat and mouse ABLIM2 gene were determined in silico. The experimental verification resulted in the revealing of two mRNA isoforms of the ABLIM2 gene. The isoforms a and b contained 20 exons and 18 exons, respectively. The highest expression of both isoforms was observed in rat brain and eye and in mouse embryos. The 5'-UTR region of the ABLIM2 gene was 127 bp in rat and mouse, but in human, it was 65 bp. The site of polyadenylation was shown to be present at a distance of 682 bp from the stop-codon in human and rat and 684 bp in mouse. The in silico analysis of the gene 5'-region was performed. The high density of brain and CNS specific transcription factors' binding sites in the promoter region was shown for all three organisms. The comparison of the amino acid sequences of the human ABLIM2 and ABLIM1 proteins showed that the number and arrangement of domains (four LIM-domains in the N-end region and the C-end VHP-domain) were similar. The structure of the ABLIM2 proteins was similar in all three organisms. On the basis of our data, it was assumed that the ABLIM2 protein was necessary for the normal functioning of neuron.
ibroproliferative diseases account for approximately 45% of all deaths in the developed world. In the kidney, glomerulosclerosis is the underlying pathology in approximately half of patients with renal failure receiving dialysis. Mesangial cell expression of the LIM protein hydrogen peroxide-induced clone-5 (Hic-5) is important in its pathogenesis. Hic-5 expression increases following mesangial cell attachment to collagen I, associated with increased collagen I expression and increased susceptibility to apoptosis both in vitro and in experimental glomerulosclerosis. TGF-β has an established role in many fibrotic diseases including glomerulosclerosis, where it increases collagen I deposition in vivo and promotes mesangial cell apoptosis in vitro. In other cell types, TGF-β induces Hic-5 expression. We investigated whether Hic-5-induced changes in mesangial cell phenotype were TGF-β-dependent. Adding exogenous TGF-β to mesangial cell cultures failed to increase Hic-5 expression; blocking TGF-β signaling did not reduce Hic-5 expression. However, inducing Hic-5 expression in mesangial cells by adhesion to collagen I led to TGF-β expression, which was abolished by small interfering RNA (siRNA) Hic-5 knockdown. Mesangial cells expressing Hic-5 showed altered latent TGF-β-binding protein expression and Smad signaling, with enhanced susceptibility to TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Mesangial cell attachment to collagen I led to increased Hic-5 expression within 2-4 h and increased procollagen I transcription within 12 h, whereas adding TGF-β to siRNA Hic-5 knockdown mesangial cells increased procollagen I transcription to a lesser degree after 48 h. Mesangial cell Hic-5 expression was associated with increased α-smooth muscle actin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression. Taken together, these data indicate that there is a prosclerotic feedback loop in mesangial cells dependent on matrix-derived signals in which Hic-5 is a pivotal signaling protein. This feedback loop is TGF-β-independent. The role of TGF-β-dependent and -independent sclerotic pathways merit further investigation.-Hornigold, N., Mooney, A. Extracellular matrix-induced Hic-5 expression in glomerular mesangial cells leads to a prosclerotic phenotype independent of TGF-.
or suppressor 1 and 2 (Lats1/2) regulate centrosomal integrity, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. As components of the centralspindlin complex, the kinesin-like protein CHO1 and its splicing variant MKLP1 colocalize with chromosome passenger proteins and GTPases and regulate the formation of the contractile ring and cytokinesis; however, the regulatory mechanisms of CHO1/MKLP1 remain elusive. Here, we show that Lats1/2 phosphorylate Ser716 in the F-actin-interacting region of CHO1, which is absent in MKLP1. Phosphorylated CHO1 localized to the centrosomes and midbody, and the actin polymerization factor LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) was identified as its binding partner. Overexpression of constitutively phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CHO1 altered the mitotic localization and activation of LIMK1 at the centrosomes in HeLa cells, leading to the inhibition of cytokinesis through excessive phosphorylation of Cofilin and mislocalization of Ect2. These results suggest that Lats1/2 stringently control cytokinesis by regulating CHO1 phosphorylation and the mitotic activation of LIMK1 on centrosome.
dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an RNA-mediated disorder characterized by muscle weakness, cardiac defects and multiple symptoms and is caused by expanded CTG repeats within the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. In this study, we found abnormal splicing of actin-binding LIM protein 1 (ABLIM1) in skeletal muscles of patients with DM1 and a DM1 mouse model (HSA(LR) ). An exon 11 inclusion isoform is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart of non-DM1 individuals, but not in skeletal muscle of patients with DM1 or other adult human tissues. Moreover, we determined that ABLIM1 splicing is regulated by several splice factors, including MBNL family proteins, CELF1, 2 and 6, and PTBP1, using a cellular splicing assay. MBNL proteins promoted the inclusion of ABLIM1 exon 11, but other proteins and expanded CUG repeats repressed exon 11 of ABLIM1. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that MBNL proteins are trapped by expanded CUG repeats and inactivated in DM1 and that CELF1 is activated in DM1. However, activation of PTBP1 has not been reported in DM1. Our results suggest that the exon 11 inclusion isoform of ABLIM1 may have a muscle-specific function, and its abnormal splicing could be related to muscle symptoms of DM.
evidence that FHL2 (four and a half LIM domains protein 2) negatively regulates cardiac hypertrophy we tested whether FHL2 altered expression or variants could be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a myocardial disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and increased interstitial fibrosis and is mainly caused by mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins. FHL2 mRNA level, FHL2 protein level and I-band-binding density were lower in HCM patients than control individuals. Screening of 121 HCM patients without mutations in established disease genes identified 2 novel (T171M, V187L) and 4 known (R177Q, N226N, D268D, P273P) FHL2 variants in unrelated HCM families. We assessed the structural and functional consequences of the nonsynonymous substitutions after adeno-associated viral-mediated gene transfer in cardiac myocytes and in 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT). Overexpression of FHL2 wild type or nonsynonymous substitutions in cardiac myocytes markedly down-regulated α-skeletal actin and partially blunted hypertrophy induced by phenylephrine or endothelin-1. After gene transfer in EHTs, force and velocity of both contraction and relaxation were higher with T171M and V187L FHL2 variants than wild type under basal conditions. Finally, chronic phenylephrine stimulation depressed EHT function in all groups, but to a lower extent in T171M-transduced EHTs. These data suggest that (1) FHL2 is down-regulated in HCM, (2) both FHL2 wild type and variants partially protected phenylephrine- or endothelin-1-induced hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes, and (3) FHL2 T171M and V187L nonsynonymous variants induced altered EHT contractility. These findings provide evidence that the 2 novel FHL2 variants could increase cardiac function in HC.
ubstrate adhesion sites, the linkage between actin filaments and integrin is regulated by mechanical stiffness of the substrate. Of potential molecular regulators, the linker proteins talin and vinculin are of particular interest because mechanical extension of talin induces vinculin binding with talin, which reinforces the actin-integrin linkage. For understanding the molecular and biophysical mechanism of rigidity sensing at cell-substrate adhesion sites, we constructed a simple physical model to examine a role of talin extension in the stiffness-dependent regulation of actin-integrin linkage. We show that talin molecules linking between retrograding actin filaments and substrate-bound integrin are extended in a manner dependent on substrate stiffness. The model predicts that, in adhesion complexes containing ≈30 talin links, talin is extended enough for vinculin binding when the substrate is stiffer than 1 kPa. The lifetime of talin links needs to be 2-5 s to achieve an appropriate response of talin extension against substrate stiffness. Furthermore, changes in actin velocity drastically shift the range of substrate stiffness that induces talin-vinculin binding. Our results suggest that talin extension is a key step in sensing and responding to substrate stiffness at cell adhesion site.
l stimulation of osteoblasts activates many cellular mechanisms including the release of ATP. Binding of ATP to purinergic receptors is key to load-induced osteogenesis. Osteoblasts also respond to fluid shear stress (FSS) with increased actin stress fiber formation (ASFF) that we postulate is in response to activation of the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R). Furthermore, we predict that ASFF increases cell stiffness and reduces the sensitivity to further mechanical stimulation. We found that small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppression of P2Y2R attenuated ASFF in response to FSS and ATP treatment. In addition, RhoA GTPase was activated within 15 min after the onset of FSS or ATP treatment and mediated ASFF following P2Y2R activation via the Rho kinase (ROCK)1/LIM kinase 2/cofilin pathway. We also observed that ASFF in response to FSS or ATP treatment increased the cell stiffness and was prevented by knocking down P2Y2R. Finally, we confirmed that the enhanced cell stiffness and ASFF in response to RhoA GTPase activation during FSS drastically reduced the mechanosensitivity of the osteoblasts based on the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) response to consecutive bouts of FSS. These data suggest that osteoblasts can regulate their mechanosensitivity to continued load through P2Y2R activation of the RhoA GTPase signaling cascade, leading to ASFF and increased cell stiffnes.
inemia is implicated in obesity-associated lumbar disc degeneration. Nevertheless, the effect of leptin on the intracellular signaling of nucleus pulposus cells is not clear. The current study sought to delineate the possible involvement of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in leptin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization in nucleus pulposus cells. Nucleus pulposus cells isolated from scoliosis patients were treated with 10 ng/mL of leptin. Fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis was used to determine the activation of RhoA signaling in nucleus pulposus cells. The protein expression of LIMK1 and cofilin-2 were analyzed by western blot analysis. F-actin cytoskeletal reorganization was assessed by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin immunoprecipitation. Leptin induced F-actin reorganization and stress fiber formation in nucleus pulposus cells, accompanied by localized RhoA activation and phosphorylation of LIMK1 and cofilin. The RhoA inhibitor C3 exoenzyme or the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 potently attenuated the effects of leptin on F-actin reorganization and stress fiber formation. Both inhibitors also prevented leptin-induced phosphorylation of LIMK1 and cofilin-2. Our study demonstrated that leptin activated the RhoA/ROCK/LIMK/cofilin-2 cascade to induce cytoskeleton reorganization in nucleus pulposus cells. These findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenic mechanism of obesity-associated lumbar disc degeneratio.
estraint stress leads to increases in brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein in some regions of the brain, e.g. the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) but decreases in other regions such as the CA3 region of the hippocampus and dendritic spine density increases or decreases in line with these changes in BDNF. Given the powerful influence that BDNF has on dendritic spine growth, these observations suggest that the fundamental reason for the direction and extent of changes in dendritic spine density in a particular region of the brain under stress is due to the changes in BDNF there. The most likely cause of these changes is provided by the stress initiated release of steroids, which readily enter neurons and alter gene expression, for example that of BDNF. Of particular interest is how glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids tend to have opposite effects on BDNF gene expression offering the possibility that differences in the distribution of their receptors and of their downstream effects might provide a basis for the differential transcription of the BDNF genes. Alternatively, differences in the extent of methylation and acetylation in the epigenetic control of BDNF transcription are possible in different parts of the brain following stress. Although present evidence points to changes in BDNF transcription being the major causal agent for the changes in spine density in different parts of the brain following stress, steroids have significant effects on downstream pathways from the TrkB receptor once it is acted upon by BDNF, including those that modulate the density of dendritic spines. Finally, although glucocorticoids play a canonical role in determining BDNF modulation of dendritic spines, recent studies have shown a role for corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) in this regard. There is considerable improvement in the extent of changes in spine size and density in rodents with forebrain specific knockout of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) even when the glucocorticoid pathways are left intact. It seems then that CRF does have a role to play in determining BDNF control of dendritic spine.
ic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe and fatal neurodegenerative disease of still unknown pathogenesis. Recent findings suggest that the skeletal muscle may play an active pathogenetic role. To investigate ALS's pathogenesis and to seek diagnostic markers, we analyzed skeletal muscle biopsies with the differential expression proteomic approach. We studied skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy controls (CN), sporadic ALS (sALS), motor neuropathies (MN) and myopathies (M). Pre-eminently among several differentially expressed proteins, Myosin binding protein H (MyBP-H) expression in ALS samples was anomalously high. MyBP-H is a component of the thick filaments of the skeletal muscle and has strong affinity for myosin, but its function is still unclear. High MyBP-H expression level was associated with abnormal expression of Rho kinase 2 (ROCK2), LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) and cofilin2, that might affect the actin-myosin interaction. We propose that MyBP-H expression level serves, as a putative biomarker in the skeletal muscle, to discriminate ALS from motor neuropathies, and that it signals the onset of dysregulation in actin-myosin interaction; this in turn might contribute to the pathogenesis of AL.
 proteins are members of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins secreted by neutrophils and activated monocytes. S100A8/A9 has cell growth-promoting activity at low concentrations by binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). In this study, we report for the first time that S100A8/A9 promoted the invasion of breast cancer cells depending on RAGE. In addition, RAGE binding to S100A8/A9 promoted the phosphorylation of LIN-11, Isl1, and MEC-3 protein domain kinase, as well as cofilin. This phosphorylation is a critical step in cofilin recycling and actin polymerization. Interestingly, RAGE binding to S100A8/A9 enhanced cell mesenchymal properties and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, RAGE binding to S100A8/A9 stabilized Snail through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Based on these observations, RAGE expression in breast cancer cells was associated with lymph node and distant metastases in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Moreover, RAGE binding to S100A8/A9 promoted lung metastasis in vivo. In summary, our in vitro and in vivo results indicated that RAGE binding to S100A8/A9 played an important role in breast cancer invasion/metastasis. This study identified both RAGE and S100A8/A9 as potential anti-invasion targets for therapeutic intervention in breast cance.
esions (FAs), sites of tight adhesion to the extracellular matrix, are composed of clusters of transmembrane integrin adhesion receptors and intracellular proteins that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways. Two integrin-binding proteins present in FAs, kindlin-1 and kindlin-2, are important for integrin activation, FA formation, and signaling. Migfilin, originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for kindlin-2-interacting proteins, is a LIM domain-containing adaptor protein found in FAs and implicated in control of cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. By binding filamin, migfilin provides a link between kindlin and the actin cytoskeleton. Here, using a combination of kindlin knockdown, biochemical pulldown assays, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we have established that the C-terminal LIM domains of migfilin dictate its FA localization, shown that these domains mediate an interaction with kindlin in vitro and in cells, and demonstrated that kindlin is important for normal migfilin dynamics in cells. We also show that when the C-terminal LIM domain region is deleted, then the N-terminal filamin-binding region of the protein, which is capable of targeting migfilin to actin-rich stress fibers, is the predominant driver of migfilin localization. Our work details a correlation between migfilin domains that drive kindlin binding and those that drive FA localization as well as a kindlin dependence on migfilin FA recruitment and mobility. We therefore suggest that the kindlin interaction with migfilin LIM domains drives migfilin FA recruitment, localization, and mobilit.
pocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. The motivation and function of the development of brown fat may thus counteract obesity, though this remains uncertain. We investigated the brown adipocyte proteome by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry. Comparative analyses of proteins focused on total protein spots to filter differentially expressed proteins during the differentiation of mouse primary brown preadipocytes. A Western blot analysis was performed to verify the target proteins. The results indicated that 10 protein spots were differentially expressed with significant changes, including the three up-regulated proteins of prohibitin, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and enoyl-CoA hydratase protein; the 5 down-regulated proteins of triosephosphate isomerase, elongation factor 2, α-tropomyosin slow, endophilin-B1, and cofilin-1 (CFL1); and the two unequivocally expressed proteins of peroxiredoxin-1 and collagen α-1(i) chain precursor. We found that during brown adipogenesis, CFL1 has an inhibitory effect on brown adipocyte differentiation. The overexpression of CFL1 inhibited the brown fat deposition and repressed the brown marker genes UCP1, PRDM16, PGC-1α and PPARγ via actin dynamics and polymerization. These observations may be novel findings that bring new insight into the detailed mechanisms of brown adipogenesis and identify possible therapeutic targets for anti-obesit.
DE to compare the proteomes of adipocytes during the brown adipogenesis of primary mouse preadipocytes. We identified 10 proteins that are differentially expressed. Among these, we found that the actin binding protein CFL1 inhibits the differentiation of brown preadipocytes. CFL1 overexpressing cells showed lower deposition of brown fat droplets, and the brown marker genes of UCP1, PRDM16, PGC-1α and PPARγ were decreased through actin dynamics and polymerizatio.
g the molecular mechanisms governing long-term synaptic plasticity is a key to understanding how the brain stores information in neural circuits and adapts to a changing environment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has emerged as a regulator of stable, late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the adult brain. However, the mechanisms by which BDNF triggers L-LTP are controversial. Here, we distill and discuss the latest advances along three main lines: 1) TrkB receptor-coupled translational control underlying dendritic protein synthesis and L-LTP, 2) Mechanisms for BDNF-induced rescue of L-LTP when protein synthesis is blocked, and 3) BDNF-TrkB regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in dendritic spines. Finally, we explore the inter-relationships between BDNF-regulated mechanisms, how these mechanisms contribute to different forms of L-LTP in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and outline outstanding issues for future research. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'BDNF Regulation of Synaptic Structure, Function, and Plasticity.
thy is a subtype of myofibrillar myopathy caused by desmin mutations and characterized by protein aggregates accumulating in muscle fibers. The aim of this study was to assess the protein composition of these aggregates. Aggregates and intact myofiber sections were obtained from skeletal muscle biopsies of five desminopathy patients by laser microdissection and analyzed by a label-free spectral count-based proteomic approach. We identified 397 proteins with 22 showing significantly higher spectral indices in aggregates (ratio &gt;1.8, p&lt;0.05). Fifteen of these proteins not previously reported as specific aggregate components provide new insights regarding pathomechanisms of desminopathy. Results of proteomic analysis were supported by immunolocalization studies and parallel reaction monitoring. Three mutant desmin variants were detected directly on the protein level as components of the aggregates, suggesting their direct involvement in aggregate-formation and demonstrating for the first time that proteomic analysis can be used for direct identification of a disease-causing mutation in myofibrillar myopathy. Comparison of the proteomic results in desminopathy with our previous analysis of aggregate composition in filaminopathy, another myofibrillar myopathy subtype, allows to determine subtype-specific proteomic profile that facilitates identification of the specific disorde.
omic analysis provides essential new insights in the composition of pathological protein aggregates in skeletal muscle fibers of desminopathy patients. The results contribute to a better understanding of pathomechanisms in myofibrillar myopathies and provide the basis for hypothesis-driven studies. The detection of specific proteomic profiles in different myofibrillar myopathy subtypes indicates that proteomic analysis may become a useful tool in differential diagnosis of protein aggregate myopathie.
ived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important regulator of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and in other brain regions, playing a role in the formation of certain forms of memory. The effects of BDNF in LTP are mediated by TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B) receptors, which are known to be coupled to the activation of the Ras/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) pathways. The role of BDNF in LTP is best studied in the hippocampus, where the neurotrophin acts at pre- and post-synaptic levels. Recent studies have shown that BDNF regulates the transport of mRNAs along dendrites and their translation at the synapse, by modulating the initiation and elongation phases of protein synthesis, and by acting on specific miRNAs. Furthermore, the effect of BDNF on transcription regulation may further contribute to long-term changes in the synaptic proteome. In this review we discuss the recent progress in understanding the mechanisms contributing to the short- and long-term regulation of the synaptic proteome by BDNF, and the role in synaptic plasticity, which is likely to influence learning and memory formation. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'BDNF Regulation of Synaptic Structure, Function, and Plasticity.
is a key factor to induce the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic area (POA) of the rat brain. Identification of estrogen-dependent signaling pathways at SDN in POA during the critical period is a prerequisite for elucidating the mechanism. In the present study, we treated female rats with/without 17β-estradiol (E2) at birth, designated as postnatal day 1 (P1), and prepared total RNA from brain slices containing SDN for DNA microarray analysis. Among the estrogen-responsive genes identified, protein kinase C-delta (PKC-δ) was significantly up-regulated by E2 at P5. We examined the downstream effectors of PKC-δ protein by Western blotting and found an E2-induced PKC-δ/Rac1/PAK1/LIMK1/cofilin pathway. In the pathway, E2 suppressed the phosphorylation (inactive form) of cofilin. This result was supported by immunohistochemistry, where the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cofilin occurred at SDN, which suggests that cell migration is a cue to create sexual dimorphism in PO.
force evokes rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Signalling pathways such as tyrosine kinases, stretch-activated Ca(2+) channels and Rho GTPases are involved in force sensing. However, how signals are transduced to actin assembly remains obscure. Here we show mechanosensitive actin polymerization by formins (formin homology proteins). Cells overexpressing mDia1 increased the amount of F-actin on release of cell tension. Fluorescence single-molecule speckle microscopy revealed rapid induction of processive actin assembly by mDia1 on cell cortex deformation. mDia1 lacking the Rho-binding domain and other formins exhibited mechanosensitive actin nucleation, suggesting Rho-independent activation. Mechanosensitive actin nucleation by mDia1 required neither Ca(2+) nor kinase signalling. Overexpressing LIM kinase abrogated the induction of processive mDia1. Furthermore, s-FDAPplus (sequential fluorescence decay after photoactivation) analysis revealed a rapid actin monomer increase on cell cortex deformation. Our direct visualization of the molecular behaviour reveals a mechanosensitive actin filament regeneration mechanism in which G-actin released by actin remodelling plays a pivotal rol.
sis requires the removal of CP110 from the mother centriole; actin dynamics also influence ciliation, at least partly by affecting the centrosomal accumulation of ciliogenic membrane vesicles. How these distinct processes are properly regulated remains unknown. Here we show that miR-129-3p, a microRNA conserved in vertebrates, controlled cilia biogenesis in cultured cells by concomitantly downregulating CP110 and repressing branched F-actin formation. Blocking miR-129-3p inhibited serum-starvation-induced ciliogenesis, whereas its overexpression potently induced ciliation in proliferating cells and also promoted cilia elongation. Gene expression analysis further identified ARP2, TOCA1, ABLIM1 and ABLIM3 as its targets in ciliation-related actin dynamics. Moreover, miR-129-3p inhibition in zebrafish embryos suppressed ciliation in Kupffer's vesicle and the pronephros, and induced developmental abnormalities including a curved body, pericardial oedema and defective left-right asymmetry. Therefore, our results reveal a mechanism that orchestrates both the centriole-to-basal body transition and subsequent cilia assembly through microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulatio.
finding relies on the ability of the growth cone to detect and interpret guidance cues and to modulate cytoskeletal changes in response to these signals. We report that the murine POU domain transcription factor Brn-3.2 regulates pathfinding in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at multiple points along their pathways and the establishment of topographic order in the superior colliculus. Using representational difference analysis, we identified Brn-3.2 gene targets likely to act on axon guidance at the levels of transcription, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction, including the actin-binding LIM domain protein abLIM. We present evidence that abLIM plays a crucial role in RGC axon pathfinding, sharing functional similarity with its C. elegans homolog, UNC-115. Our findings provide insights into a Brn-3.2-directed hierarchical program linking signaling events to cytoskeletal changes required for axon pathfindin.
ance receptors modulate the growth cone cytoskeleton through signaling pathways that are not well understood. Here, we describe the C. elegans unc-115 gene, which encodes a candidate cytoskeletal linker protein that acts in axon guidance. unc-115 mutants have defects in a subset of axons, particularly as the affected axons change environments during outgrowth. The unc-115 gene encodes a putative actin-binding protein that is similar to the human actin-binding protein abLIM/limatin; it has a villin headpiece domain and three LIM domains that could mediate protein interactions. unc-115 is expressed in neurons during their development and is required cell-autonomously in certain neurons for normal axon guidance. We propose that UNC-115 modulates the growth cone actin cytoskeleton in response to signals received by growth cone receptor.
ns, found in over 60 proteins, play key roles in the regulation of developmental pathways. They were first identified as cysteine-rich motifs found in the three proteins Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3. LIM proteins frequently contain DNA-binding homeodomains, allowing these proteins to activate transcription. LIM domains also function as protein-binding interfaces, mediating specific protein-protein interactions. Limatin is a novel LIM protein that binds to actin filaments via a domain that is homologous to erythrocyte dematin. Here we report the murine and human chromosomal localizations of limatin (LIMAB1). Limatin was mapped to mouse Chromosome 19 by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and to human chromosome region 10q25 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Radiation hybrid mapping placed LIMAB1 in a 37-cR interval between markers D10S554 and D10S2390. Interestingly, 10q25 is a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in human tumors, thus identifying limatin as a candidate tumor suppressor gen.
tress promotes cognitive impairment and dendritic spine loss in hippocampal neurons. In this animal model of depression, spine loss probably involves a weakening of the interaction between pre- and postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin, followed by disruption of the cytoskeleton. N-cadherin, in concert with catenin, stabilizes the cytoskeleton through Rho-family GTPases. Via their effector LIM kinase (LIMK), RhoA and ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC) GTPases phosphorylate and inhibit cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing molecule, favoring spine growth. Additionally, RhoA, through Rho kinase (ROCK), inactivates myosin phosphatase through phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit (MYPT1), producing actomyosin contraction and probable spine loss. Some micro-RNAs negatively control the translation of specific mRNAs involved in Rho GTPase signaling. For example, miR-138 indirectly activates RhoA, and miR-134 reduces LIMK1 levels, resulting in spine shrinkage; in contrast, miR-132 activates RAC1, promoting spine formation. We evaluated whether N-cadherin/β-catenin and Rho signaling is sensitive to chronic restraint stress. Stressed rats exhibit anhedonia, impaired associative learning, and immobility in the forced swim test and reduction in N-cadherin levels but not β-catenin in the hippocampus. We observed a reduction in spine number in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, with no effect on the levels of miR-132 or miR-134. Although the stress did not modify the RAC-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway, we observed increased phospho-MYPT1 levels, probably mediated by RhoA-ROCK activation. Furthermore, chronic stress raises the levels of miR-138 in accordance with the observed activation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway. Our findings suggest that a dysregulation of RhoA-ROCK activity by chronic stress could potentially underlie spine loss in hippocampal neurons. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, In.
eferred partner (LPP) is a LIM domain protein, which has multiple functions as an actin-binding protein and a transcriptional coactivator, and it has been suggested that LPP has some roles in cell migration or invasion, however, its role in cancer cells remains to be elucidated. Here, we showed that LPP degraded N-cadherin in lung cancer, PC14PE6 cells via regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 15 (MMP-15), and loss-of-LPP increases collective cell migration (CCM) and dissemination consequently. Knockdown of LPP and its functional partner, Etv5, markedly restores the full-length N-cadherin and increases cell-cell adhesion. We investigated the common target of LPP and Etv5, and found that MMP-15 is transcribed as their direct transcriptional target. Furthermore, MMP-15 could directly digest the N-cadherin extracellular domain. LPP knockdown in PC14PE6 cells increases N-cadherin-dependent CCM in the three-dimensional collagen gel invasion assays, and promoted the dissemination of cancer cells when they were orthotopically implanted in nude mice. Immunohistochemistry of lung adenocarcinoma specimens revealed the heterogeneity of LPP intensity and complementary expression of LPP and N-cadherin in the primary tumors. These findings suggest that loss-of-LPP, Etv5 or MMP-15 can be a prognostic marker of increasing malignancy.Oncogene advance online publication, 1 June 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.15.

eceptor-interacting protein 6 (Trip6), a multifunctional protein belonging to the zyxin family of LIM proteins, is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including cell migration and tumorigenesis. However, the role of Trip6 in neurons remains unknown. Here, we show that Trip6 is expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons and promotes dendritic morphogenesis. Through interaction with the glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and myosin VI, Trip6 is crucial for the total dendritic length and the number of primary dendrites in cultured hippocampal neurons. Trip6 depletion reduces F-actin content and impairs dendritic morphology, and this phenocopies GRIP1 or myosin VI knockdown. Furthermore, phosphorylation of GRIP1(956T) by AKT1 inhibits the interaction between GRIP1 and myosin VI, but facilitates GRIP1 binding to 14-3-3 protein, which is required for regulating F-actin organization and dendritic morphogenesis. Thus, the Trip6-GRIP1-myosin VI interaction and its regulation on F-actin network play a significant role in dendritic morphogenesi.
the potential beneficial effects of growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP)-6 on muscle functions, a newly synthesized GHRP-6-biotin conjugate was tested on cultured myoblast cells. Increased expression of myogenic marker proteins was observed in GHRP-6-biotin conjugate-treated cells. Additionally, increased expression levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 and collagen type I were observed. Furthermore, GHRP-6-biotin conjugate-treated cells showed increased metabolic activity, as indicated by increased concentrations of energy metabolites, such as ATP and lactate, and increased enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Finally, binding protein analysis suggested few candidate proteins, including desmin, actin, and zinc finger protein 691 as potential targets for GHRP6-biotin conjugate action. These results suggest that the newly synthesized GHRP-6-biotin conjugate has myogenic stimulating activity through, at least in part, by stimulating collagen type I synthesis and several key proteins. Practical applications of the GHRP-6-biotin conjugate could include improving muscle condition. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(9): 501-506.
s a LIM-only domain protein that forms a ternary complex with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and parvin (to form the IPP complex) downstream of integrins. Here, we demonstrate that PINCH-1 (also known as Lims1) gene ablation in the epidermis of mice caused epidermal detachment from the basement membrane, epidermal hyperthickening and progressive hair loss. PINCH-1-deficient keratinocytes also displayed profound adhesion, spreading and migration defects in vitro that were substantially more severe than those of ILK-deficient keratinocytes indicating that PINCH-1 also exerts functions in an ILK-independent manner. By isolating the PINCH-1 interactome, the LIM-domain-containing and actin-binding protein epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN, also known as LIMA1) was identified as a new PINCH-1-associated protein. EPLIN localized, in a PINCH-1-dependent manner, to integrin adhesion sites of keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro and its depletion severely attenuated keratinocyte spreading and migration on collagen and fibronectin without affecting PINCH-1 levels in focal adhesions. Given that the low PINCH-1 levels in ILK-deficient keratinocytes were sufficient to recruit EPLIN to integrin adhesions, our findings suggest that PINCH-1 regulates integrin-mediated adhesion of keratinocytes through the interactions with ILK as well as EPLI.
 years, as the first of the syndecan family was cloned, interest in these transmembrane proteoglycans has steadily increased. While four distinct members are present in mammals, one is present in invertebrates, including C. elegans that is such a powerful genetic model. The syndecans, therefore, have a long evolutionary history, indicative of important roles. However, these roles have been elusive. The knockout in the worm has a developmental neuronal phenotype, while knockouts of the syndecans in the mouse are mild and mostly limited to post-natal rather than developmental effects. Moreover, their association with high-affinity receptors, such as integrins, growth factor receptors, frizzled and slit/robo, have led to the notion that syndecans are coreceptors, with minor roles. Given that their heparan sulphate chains can gather many different protein ligands, this gave credence to views that the importance of syndecans lay with their ability to concentrate ligands and that only the extracellular polysaccharide was of significance. Syndecans are increasingly identified with roles in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including tumour progression, vascular disease, arthritis and inflammation. This has provided impetus to understanding syndecan roles in more detail. It emerges that while the cytoplasmic domains of syndecans are small, they have clear interactive capabilities, most notably with the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, through the binding and activation of signalling molecules, it is likely that syndecans are important receptors in their own right. Here, an overview of syndecan structure and function is provided, with some prospects for the futur.
r podocytes are highly specialized terminally differentiated cells that act as a filtration barrier in the kidney. Mutations in the actin-binding protein, α-actinin 4 (ACTN4), are linked to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a chronic kidney disease characterized by proteinuria. Aberrant activation of NF-κB pathway in podocytes is implicated in glomerular diseases including proteinuria. We demonstrate here that stable knockdown of ACTN4 in podocytes significantly reduces TNFα-mediated induction of NF-κB target genes, including IL-1β and NPHS1, and activation of an NF-κB-driven reporter without interfering with p65 nuclear translocation. Overexpression of ACTN4 and an actin binding-defective variant increases the reporter activity. In contrast, an FSGS-linked ACTN4 mutant, K255E, which has increased actin binding activity and is predominantly cytoplasmic, fails to potentiate NF-κB activity. Mechanistically, IκBα blocks the association of ACTN4 and p65 in the cytosol. In response to TNFα, both NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 translocate to the nucleus, where they bind and recruit ACTN4 to their targeted promoters, IL-1β and IL-8. Taken together, our data identify ACTN4 as a novel coactivator for NF-κB transcription factors in podocytes. Importantly, this nuclear function of ACTN4 is independent of its actin binding activity in the cytoplas.
an actin-binding protein associated with actin assembly dynamics in cancer cells. Here, we report that LASP1 is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) where it promotes invasion and metastasis. We found that LASP1 overexpression in PDAC cells was mediated by HIF1α through direct binding to a hypoxia response element in the LASP1 promoter. HIF1α stimulated LASP1 expression in PDAC cells in vitro and mouse tumor xenografts in vivo. Clinically, LASP1 overexpression in PDAC patient specimens was associated significantly with lymph node metastasis and overall survival. Overall, our results defined LASP1 as a direct target gene for HIF1α upregulation that is critical for metastatic progression of PDA.
n (LtxA; Leukothera), a protein toxin secreted by the oral bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, specifically kills white blood cells (WBCs). LtxA binds to the receptor known as lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), a β2 integrin expressed only on the surface of WBCs. LtxA is being studied as a virulence factor that helps A. actinomycetemcomitans evade host defences and as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of WBC diseases. LtxA-mediated cell death in monocytes involves both caspases and lysosomes; however, the signalling proteins that regulate and mediate cell death remain largely unknown. We used a 2D-gel proteomics approach to analyse the global protein expression changes that occur in response to LtxA. This approach identified the protein cofilin, which underwent dephosphorylation upon LtxA treatment. Cofilin is a ubiquitous actin-binding protein known to regulate actin dynamics and is regulated by LIM kinase (LIMK)-mediated phosphorylation. LtxA-mediated cofilin dephosphorylation was dependent on LFA-1 and cofilin dephosphorylation did not occur when LFA-1 bound to its natural ligand, ICAM-1. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of LIMK (LIMKi) also led to cofilin dephosphorylation and enhanced killing by LtxA. This enhanced sensitivity to LtxA coincided with an increase in lysosomal disruption, and an increase in LFA-1 surface expression and clustering. Both LIMKi and LtxA treatment also induced actin depolymerization, which could play a role in trafficking and surface distribution of LFA-1. We propose a model in which LtxA-mediated cofilin dephosphorylation leads to actin depolymerization, LFA-1 overexpression/clustering, and enhanced lysosomal-mediated cell deat.
dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK) has been shown to localize to the lamella of mammalian cells through its interaction with an adaptor protein, leucine repeat adaptor protein 35a (LRAP35a), which links it with myosin 18A (MYO18A) for activation of the lamellar actomyosin network essential for cell migration. Here, we report the identification of another adaptor protein LRAP25 that mediates MRCK association with LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1). The lamellipodium-localized LRAP25-MRCK complex is essential for the regulation of local LIMK1 and its downstream F-actin regulatory factor cofilin. Functionally, inhibition of either MRCK or LRAP25 resulted in a marked suppression of LIMK1 activity and down-regulation of cofilin phosphorylation in response to aluminum fluoride induction in B16-F1 cells, which eventually resulted in deregulation of lamellipodial F-actin and reorganization of cytoskeletal structures causing defects in cell polarization and motility. These biochemical and functional characterizations thus underline the functional relevance of the LRAP25-MRCK complex in LIMK1-cofilin signaling and the importance of LRAP adaptors as key determinants of MRCK cellular localization and downstream specificitie.
11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 domains) genes have been reported to trigger the formation of actin bundles, a major higher-order cytoskeletal assembly, in higher plants; however, the stress resistance related functions of these genes are still not well known. In this study, we collected 22 LIM genes designated as Brassica rapa LIM (BrLIM) from the Brassica database, analyzed the sequences, compared them with LIM genes of other plants and analyzed their expression after applying biotic and abiotic stresses in Chinese cabbag.
ence analysis these genes were confirmed as LIM genes and found to have a high degree of homology with LIM genes of other species. These genes showed distinct clusters when compared to other recognized LIM proteins upon phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, organ specific expression of these genes was observed in Chinese cabbage plants, with BrPLIM2a, b, c, BrDAR1, BrPLIM2e, f and g only being expressed in flower buds. Furthermore, the expression of these genes (except for BrDAR1 and BrPLIM2e) was high in the early flowering stages. The remaining genes were expressed in almost all organs tested. All BrDAR genes showed higher expression in flower buds compared to other organs. These organ specific expressions were clearly correlated with the phylogenetic grouping. In addition, BrWLIM2c and BrDAR4 responded to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans infection, while commonly two BrDARs and eight BrLIMs responded to cold, ABA and pH (pH5, pH7 and pH9) stress treatments in Chinese cabbage plant.
ether, the results of this study indicate that BrLIM and BrDAR genes may be involved in resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses in Brassic.
n important nutrient in the human diet, has been implicated in cancer, but its role in metastasis is not established. We have shown previously that the withdrawal of medium folate leads to the inhibition of migration and invasion of A549 lung carcinoma cells. Here we have demonstrated that medium folate regulates the function of Rho GTPases by enabling their carboxyl methylation and translocation to plasma membrane. Conversely, the lack of folate leads to the retention of these proteins in endoplasmic reticulum. Folate also promoted the switch from inactive (GDP-bound) to active (GTP-bound) GTPases, resulting in the activation of downstream kinases p21-activated kinase and LIM kinase and phosphorylation of the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin. We have further demonstrated that in A549 cells two GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, but not Cdc42, are immediate sensors of folate status: the siRNA silencing of RhoA or Rac1 blocked effects of folate on cofilin phosphorylation and cellular migration and invasion. The finding that folate modulates metastatic potential of cancer cells was confirmed in an animal model of lung cancer using tail vein injection of A549 cells in SCID mice. A folate-rich diet enhanced lung colonization and distant metastasis to lymph nodes and decreased overall survival (35 versus 63 days for mice on a folate-restricted diet). High folate also promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells and experimental mouse tumors. Our study provides experimental evidence for a mechanism of metastasis promotion by dietary folate and highlights the interaction between nutrients and metastasis-related signalin.
 stress primes monocytes for accelerated chemokine-mediated adhesion, migration, and recruitment into vascular lesions by increasing actin remodeling. The mechanism linking metabolic stress to accelerated actin turnover and enhanced monocyte migration was not known. We tested the hypothesis that in metabolically primed monocytes, the acceleration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced chemotaxis is mediated by the hyperactivation of cofili.
 priming was induced by exposing human THP-1 monocytes to diabetic conditions, that is, human native low-density lipoprotein plus high glucose concentrations. In healthy monocytes, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 induced the phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin. This response was completely blocked in metabolically primed monocytes but restored by overexpression of the thiol transferase, glutaredoxin 1. Cofilin kinase, LIM kinase 1, and cofilin phosphatase, Slingshot-1L, were not affected by metabolic stress. However, metabolic priming increased 3.8-fold the S-glutathionylation of the Slingshot-1L-binding protein 14-3-3ζ (zeta), resulting in its caspase-dependent degradation. Glutaredoxin 1 overexpression inhibited low-density lipoprotein plus high glucose-induced S-glutathionylation and degradation of 14-3-3ζ. The C25S mutant of 14-3-3ζ was resistant to both S-glutathionylation and degradation induced by low-density lipoprotein plus high glucose. Overexpression of the C25S mutant restored monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced cofilin phosphorylation and prevented accelerated migration of metabolically stressed monocytes, suggesting that loss of 14-3-3ζ increases the pool of free Slingshot-1L phosphatase, thereby preventing the phosphorylation and deactivation of cofilin in response to chemokine activatio.
ting the inactivation of cofilin, metabolic stress-induced degradation of 14-3-3ζ promotes the conversion of blood monocytes into a hypermigratory, proatherogenic phenotyp.
many DNA aberrations in melanoma have been well characterized, including focal amplification and deletions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, broad regions of chromosomal gain and loss are less well understood. One possibility is that these broad events are a consequence of collateral damage from targeting single loci. Another possibility is that the loss of large regions permits the simultaneous repression of multiple tumor suppressors by broadly decreasing the resident gene dosage and expression. Here, we test this hypothesis in a targeted fashion using RNA interference to suppress multiple candidate residents in broad regions of loss. We find that loss of chromosome regions 6q, 10, and 11q21-ter is correlated with broadly decreased expression of most resident genes and that multiple resident genes impacted by broad regional loss of chromosome 10 are tumor suppressors capable of affecting tumor growth and/or invasion. We also provide additional functional support for Ablim1 as a novel tumor suppressor. Our results support the hypothesis that multiple cancer genes are targeted by regional chromosome copy number aberration.
 in fused in sarcoma (FUS) in a subset of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) linked this DNA/RNA-binding protein to neurodegeneration. Most of the mutations disrupt the nuclear localization signal which strongly suggests a loss-of-function pathomechanism, supported by cytoplasmic inclusions. FUS-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions are also found in a subset of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Here, we discuss recent data on the role of alternative splicing in FUS-mediated pathology in the central nervous system. Several groups have shown that FUS binds broadly to many transcripts in the brain and have also identified a plethora of putative splice targets; however, only ABLIM1, BRAF, Ewing sarcoma protein R1 (EWSR1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), NgCAM cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM), and netrin G1 (NTNG1) have been identified in at least three of four studies. Gene ontology analysis of all putative targets unanimously suggests a role in axon growth and cytoskeletal organization, consistent with the altered morphology of dendritic spines and axonal growth cones reported upon loss of FUS. Among the axonal targets, MAPT/tau and NTNG1 have been further validated in biochemical studies. The next challenge will be to confirm changes of FUS-mediated alternative splicing in patients and define their precise role in the pathophysiology of ALS and FTL.
ular matrix proteins, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins form a dynamic network interacting with signalling molecules as an adaptive response to altered gravity. An important issue is the exact differentiation between real microgravity responses of the cells or cellular reactions to hypergravity and/or vibrations. To determine the effects of real microgravity on human cells, we used four DLR parabolic flight campaigns and focused on the effects of short-term microgravity (22 s), hypergravity (1.8 g), and vibrations on ML-1 thyroid cancer cells. No signs of apoptosis or necrosis were detectable. Gene array analysis revealed 2,430 significantly changed transcripts. After 22 s microgravity, the F-actin and cytokeratin cytoskeleton was altered, and ACTB and KRT80 mRNAs were significantly upregulated after the first and thirty-first parabolas. The COL4A5 mRNA was downregulated under microgravity, whereas OPN and FN were significantly upregulated. Hypergravity and vibrations did not change ACTB, KRT-80 or COL4A5 mRNA. MTSS1 and LIMA1 mRNAs were downregulated/slightly upregulated under microgravity, upregulated in hypergravity and unchanged by vibrations. These data indicate that the graviresponse of ML-1 cells occurred very early, within the first few seconds. Downregulated MTSS1 and upregulated LIMA1 may be an adaptive mechanism of human cells for stabilizing the cytoskeleton under microgravity condition.
ignalling increases the lateral cell adhesions of prostate epithelial cells grown in 3D culture. The aim of this study was to use microarray analysis to identify significant epithelial signalling pathways and genes in this proces.
y analysis was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed when epithelial cells were grown in 3D Matrigel culture with stromal co-culture compared to without stroma. Two culture models were employed: primary epithelial cells (ten samples) and an epithelial cell line (three experiments). A separate microarray analysis was performed on each model system and then compared to identify tissue-relevant genes in a cell line mode.
signalling was significantly ranked for both model systems and in both models the TGF beta signalling gene SOX4 was significantly down regulated. Analysis of all differentially expressed genes to identify genes that were common to both models found several morphology related gene clusters; actin binding (DIAPH2, FHOD3, ABLIM1, TMOD4, MYH10), GTPase activator activity (BCR, MYH10), cytoskeleton (MAP2, MYH10, TMOD4, FHOD3), protein binding (ITGA6, CD44), proteinaceous extracellular matrix (NID2, CILP2), ion channel/ ion transporter activity (CACNA1C, CACNB2, KCNH2, SLC8A1, SLC39A9) and genes associated with developmental pathways (POFUT1, FZD2, HOXA5, IRX2, FGF11, SOX4, SMARCC1.
state cultures, stromal cells increase lateral epithelial cell adhesions. We show that this morphological effect is associated with gene expression changes to TGF beta signalling, cytoskeleton and anion activit.
ty traits like novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), and reward dependence (RD) are known to be moderately heritable (30-60%). These personality traits and their comorbidities, such as alcohol dependence (AD), may share genetic components. We examined 11,120 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 292 nuclear families from the Genetic Analysis Workshop 14, a subset from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). A family-based association analysis was performed using the FBAT program. NS, HA, and RD were treated as quantitative traits and AD as a binary trait. Based on a multivariate association test of three quantitative traits in FBAT, we observed 20 SNPs with p &lt; 10(-3). Interestingly, several genes (TESK2, TIPARP, THEMIS, ABLIM1, RFX4, STON2 and LILRA1) are associated with three personality traits with p &lt; 10(-3) using single trait analysis and AD. Especially, SNP rs727532 within ABLIM1 gene at 10q25 showed the most significant association (p = 6.4 × 10(-5)) in the multivariate test and strong associations with NS, HA, RD, and AD (p = 4.48 × 10(-4), 1.2 × 10(-5), 5.6 × 10(-5), 3.12 × 10(-4), respectively) in the COGA sample. In addition, the association of rs727532 with AD was confirmed in a replication study. This study reports some newly recognized associations between several genetic loci and both AD and three personality trait.
sis of projection neurons requires that axons be initiated, extended, and connected. Differences in the expression of axon growth and guidance genes must drive these events, but comprehensively characterizing these differences in a single neuronal type has not been accomplished. Guided by a catalog of gene expression in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that Cxcr4 and Dbn1, two axon initiation genes, marked the developmental transition from basal progenitor cells to immature OSNs in the olfactory epithelium. The CXCR4 immunoreactivity of these nascent OSNs overlapped partially with markers of proliferation of basal progenitor cells and partially with immunoreactivity for GAP43, the canonical marker of immature OSNs. Intracellular guidance cue signaling transcripts Ablim1, Crmp1, Dypsl2, Dpysl3, Dpysl5, Gap43, Marcskl1, and Stmn1-4 were specific to, or much more abundant in, the immature OSN layer. Receptors that mediate axonal inhibition or repulsion tended to be expressed in both immature and mature OSNs (Plxna1, Plxna4, Nrp2, Efna5) or specifically in mature OSNs (Plxna3, Unc5b, Efna3, Epha5, Epha7), although some were specific to immature OSNs (Plxnb1, Plxnb2, Plxdc2, Nrp1). Cell adhesion molecules were expressed either by both immature and mature OSNs (Dscam, Ncam1, Ncam2, Nrxn1) or solely by immature OSNs (Chl1, Nfasc1, Dscaml1). Given the loss of intracellular signaling protein expression, the continued expression of guidance cue receptors in mature OSNs is consistent with a change in the role of these receptors, perhaps to sending signals back to the cell body and nucleu.
quantification by normalization against a stably expressed reference gene is a widely used data analysis method in microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) platforms; however, recent evidence suggests that many commonly utilized reference genes are unstable in certain experimental systems and situations. The primary aim of this study, therefore, was to screen and identify stably expressed reference genes in a well-established rat model of vocal fold mucosal injury. We selected and evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes. Ablim1, Sptbn1, and Wrnip1 were identified as stably expressed in a model-specific microarray dataset and were further validated as suitable reference genes in an independent qRT-PCR experiment using 2(-DeltaCT) and pairwise comparison-based (geNorm) analyses. Parallel analysis of six commonly used reference genes identified Sdha as the only stably expressed candidate in this group. Sdha, Sptbn1, and the geometric mean of Sdha and Sptbn1 each provided accurate normalization of target gene Tgfb1; Gapdh, the least stable candidate gene in our dataset, provided inaccurate normalization and an invalid experimental result. The stable reference genes identified here are suitable for accurate normalization of target gene expression in vocal fold mucosal injury experiment.
es show clear asymmetry in left-right (L-R) patterning of their organs and associated vasculature. During mammalian development a cilia driven leftwards flow of liquid leads to the left-sided expression of Nodal, which in turn activates asymmetric expression of the transcription factor Pitx2. While Pitx2 asymmetry drives many aspects of asymmetric morphogenesis, it is clear from published data that additional asymmetrically expressed loci must exis.
ression screen identified the cytoskeletally-associated gene, actin binding lim protein 1 (Ablim1), as asymmetrically expressed in both the node and left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). LPM expression closely mirrors that of Nodal. Significantly, Ablim1 LPM asymmetry was detected in the absence of detectable Nodal. In the node, Ablim1 was initially expressed symmetrically across the entire structure, resolving to give a peri-nodal ring at the headfold stage in a flow and Pkd2-dependent manner. The peri-nodal ring of Ablim1 expression became asymmetric by the mid-headfold stage, showing stronger right than left-sided expression. Node asymmetry became more apparent as development proceeded; expression retreated in an anticlockwise direction, disappearing first from the left anterior node. Indeed, at early somite stages Ablim1 shows a unique asymmetric expression pattern, in the left lateral plate and to the right side of the nod.
Ablim1 is expressed in the absence of detectable LPM Nodal, clearly revealing existence of a Pitx2 and Nodal-independent left-sided signal in mammals. At the node, a previously unrecognised action of early nodal flow and Pkd2 activity, within the pit of the node, influences gene expression in a symmetric manner. Subsequent Ablim1 expression in the peri-nodal ring reveals a very early indication of L-R asymmetry. Ablim1 expression analysis at the node acts as an indicator of nodal flow. Together these results make Ablim1 a candidate for controlling aspects of L-R identity and patternin.
ement of adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) is complex. The Weiss score is the present most widely used system for ACT diagnosis. An ACT is scored from 0 to 9, with a higher score correlating with increased malignancy. However, ACTs with a score of 3 can be phenotypically benign or malignant. Our objective is to use microarray profiling of a cohort of adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) and adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs) to identify discriminatory genes that could be used as an adjunct to the Weiss score. A cohort of Weiss score defined ACCs and ACAs were profiled using Affymetrix HGU133plus2.0 genechips. Genes with high-discriminatory power were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses and confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of IGF2, MAD2L1, and CCNB1 were significantly higher in ACCs compared with ACAs while ABLIM1, NAV3, SEPT4, and RPRM were significantly lower. Several proteins, including IGF2, MAD2L1, CCNB1, and Ki-67 had high-diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ACCs from ACAs. The best results, however, were obtained with a combination of IGF2 and Ki-67, with 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity in diagnosing ACCs. Microarray gene expression profiling accurately differentiates ACCs from ACAs. The combination of IGF2 and Ki-67 IHC is also highly accurate in distinguishing between the two groups and is particularly helpful in ACTs with Weiss score of .
-binding LIM domain protein (abLIM) is the mammalian homologue of UNC-115, a protein mediating axon guidance in C. elegans. AbLIM is widely expressed with three isoforms differing from one another by the length of their amino termini. Experiments utilizing dominant-negative mutants in the chick retina suggested a role for abLIM in axon path finding in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). To investigate which variant is involved in the regulation of mammalian RGC axon guidance, we analyzed their expression profile in mice. The longest variant, abLIM-L, is highly enriched in the ganglion cell layer. AbLIM-L is up-regulated postnatally which temporally overlaps with the period of RGC axon remodeling. In contrast, the abLIM-M and abLIM-S variants are widespread and remain relatively constant through development. By selective gene targeting, we ablated abLIM-L to explore its functional significance in vivo. AbLIM-L mutant mice exhibit no apparent morphological or functional defects in photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons. Retinofugal projections and synaptic maturation also appear normal. These data suggest that abLIM-M is likely the isoform performing the essential function related to axon guidanc.
 that couple the actin-based cytoskeleton to intracellular signaling pathways are central to the processes of cellular morphogenesis and differentiation. We have characterized a novel protein, the actin-binding LIM (abLIM) protein, which could mediate such interactions between actin filaments and cytoplasmic targets. abLIM protein consists of a COOH-terminal cytoskeletal domain that is fused to an NH2-terminal domain consisting of four double zinc finger motifs. The cytoskeletal domain is approximately 50% identical to erythrocyte dematin, an actin-bundling protein of the red cell membrane skeleton, while the zinc finger domains conform to the LIM motif consensus sequence. In vitro expression studies demonstrate that abLIM protein can bind to F-actin through the dematin-like domain. Transcripts corresponding to three distinct isoforms have a widespread tissue distribution. However, a polypeptide corresponding to the full-length isoform is found exclusively in the retina and is enriched in biochemical extracts of retinal rod inner segments. abLIM protein also undergoes extensive phosphorylation in light-adapted retinas in vivo, and its developmental expression in the retina coincides with the elaboration of photoreceptor inner and outer segments. Based on the composite primary structure of abLIM protein, actin-binding capacity, potential regulation via phosphorylation, and isoform expression pattern, we speculate that abLIM may play a general role in bridging the actin-based cytoskeleton with an array of potential LIM protein-binding partners. The developmental time course of abLIM expression in the retina suggests that the retina-specific isoform may have a specialized role in the development or elaboration of photoreceptor inner and outer segment.
H2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) is an adaptor protein that is essential for T cell development and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation. Previous studies have identified an important negative feedback regulation of SLP-76 by HPK1 (hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1; MAP4K1)-induced Ser-376 phosphorylation. Ser-376 phosphorylation of SLP-76 mediates 14-3-3 binding, resulting in the attenuation of SLP-76 activation and downstream signaling; however, the underlying mechanism of this action remains unknown. Here, we report that phosphorylated SLP-76 is ubiquitinated and targeted for proteasomal degradation during TCR signaling. SLP-76 ubiquitination is mediated by Ser-376 phosphorylation. Furthermore, Lys-30 is identified as a ubiquitination site of SLP-76. Loss of Lys-30 ubiquitination of SLP-76 results in enhanced anti-CD3 antibody-induced ERK and JNK activation. These results reveal a novel regulation mechanism of SLP-76 by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of activated SLP-76, which is mediated by Ser-376 phosphorylation, leading to down-regulation of TCR signalin.
d cell death 4 (Pdcd4) is a novel tumor suppressor, whose expression is frequently down-regulated in several types of cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated that Pdcd4 knockdown up-regulates MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) expression and increases phosphorylation of c-Jun. Over-expression of c-Myc in HEK293 cells increases the levels of MAP4K1, MAP4K1 promoter activity, and phospho-c-Jun. Mutation analysis showed that the c-Myc binding site at -536bp (relative to the initiation ATG) of map4k1 promoter responds to c-Myc regulation. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c-Myc directly binds to map4k1 promoter at this site. Down-regulation of c-Myc reverses MAP4K1 expression and AP-1 activation in Pdcd4 knockdown cells. Moreover, over-expression of dominant negative Tcf4 decreases expression of c-Myc and MAP4K1, JNK activation, and AP-1 dependent transcription. Thus, activation of β-catenin/Tcf dependent transcription in Pdcd4 knockdown cells up-regulates MAP4K1 expression and AP-1 activity via c-Myc. The study presented here further reveals in detail the mechanism of how Pdcd4 inhibits tumor cell invasion and provides a functional connection between β-catenin/Tcf and AP-1 dependent transcriptio.
inical trials aimed at improved treatment of AML by administration of vitamin D derivatives showed unremarkable results, suggesting development of vitamin D resistance in patients' AML blasts. Since mechanisms of vitamin D resistance are not clear, we studied 40AF cells, a subline of HL60 cells that can proliferate in the presence of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25D). We found that mRNA and protein levels of HPK1, an upstream MAP4 kinase, are dramatically increased in 40AF cells, and HPK1 protein is further increased when the 1,25D resistance of 40AF cells is partially reversed by the addition of carnosic acid and p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (DCS cocktail). Knockdown of HPK1 reduces 1,25D/DCS-induced differentiation of both 1,25D-sensitive HL60 and U937 cells and 1,25D-resistant 40AF cells, but the effect of HPK1 knockdown on differentiation-associated G 1 arrest is more apparent in the resistant than the sensitive cells. To explain why 40AF and the intrinsically vitamin D-resistant KG-1a cells can proliferate in the presence of vitamin D, we found that the cleaved HPK1 fragment (HPK1-C) level is high in 40AF and KG-1a cells, but when differentiation is induced by DCS, HPK1-C decreases while full-length (FL)-HPK1 increases. Accordingly, inhibition of proteolysis with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh reduced HPK1 cleavage and enhanced DCS-induced differentiation of 40AF cells. The results indicate that FL-HPK1 is a positive regulator of vitamin D-induced differentiation in AML cells, but the cleaved HPK1 fragment inhibits differentiation. Thus, high HPK1 cleavage activity contributes to vitamin D resistance, and HPK1 has a dual role in AML cell differentiatio.
 amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway seems to play important roles in the pathogenesis of several tumors, but its significance in extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) has not been investigated yet. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential contribution of the JNK-associated molecules, such as hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-related protein kinase kinase kinase1 (MEKK1), transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and phosphomitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (p-MKK4) to the development of EMPD. Thirty-five paraffin-embedded EMPD specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for HPK1, MEKK1, TAK1, and p-MKK4. All the 35 EMPD, including 13 dermal invasive EMPD and 2 lymph node metastasis, showed cytoplasmic overexpression of HPK1, MEKK1, and p-MKK4. The expression (%positive cells) of HPK1, MEKK1, and p-MKK4 in EMPD (92.3% ± 8.6%, 92.9% ± 8.6%, and 92.7% ± 7.4%, respectively) were significantly higher than in normal eccrine sweat gland cells (51.6% ± 10.4%, 44.7% ± 11.7%, 0% ± 0%). In addition, the expression of HPK1-, MEKK1-, and p-MKK4 in invasive EMPD was significantly higher than in noninvasive EMPD. Meanwhile, the expression of TAK1 was basically low and no significantly different between EMPD and normal controls. In conclusion, these results indicate that JNK pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of EMP.
etic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a hematopoietic cell-restricted member of the Ste20 serine/threonine kinase super family. We recently reported that HPK1 is involved in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by sequential activation of MLK3-MKK7-JNK3 after cerebral ischemia. Here, we used 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2) and MK801 to investigate the events upstream of HPK1 in ischemic brain injury. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot results showed that PP2 and MK801 significantly decreased the activation of Src, HPK1, MLK3, JNK3 and c-Jun, respectively, during ischemia/reperfusion. Histology and TUNEL staining showed PP2 or MK801 protects against neuron death after brain ischemia. We speculate that this unique signaling pathway through the tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 promotes ischemic brain injury by activated Src via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and, ultimately, the activation of the MLK3-MKK7-JNK3 pathway after cerebral ischemi.
e activity is a crucial cell-autonomous factor supporting tumor initiation and progression. To decipher pathways impacted by Ral, we have generated null and hypomorph alleles of the Drosophila melanogaster Ral gene. Ral null animals were not viable. Reduced Ral expression in cells of the sensory organ lineage had no effect on cell division but led to postmitotic cell-specific apoptosis. Genetic epistasis and immunofluorescence in differentiating sensory organs suggested that Ral activity suppresses c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and induces p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. HPK1/GCK-like kinase (HGK), a MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase that can drive JNK activation, was found as an exocyst-associated protein in vivo. The exocyst is a Ral effector, and the epistasis between mutants of Ral and of msn, the fly ortholog of HGK, suggest the functional relevance of an exocyst/HGK interaction. Genetic analysis also showed that the exocyst is required for the execution of Ral function in apoptosis. We conclude that in Drosophila Ral counters apoptotic programs to support cell fate determination by acting as a negative regulator of JNK activity and a positive activator of p38 MAP kinase. We propose that the exocyst complex is Ral executioner in the JNK pathway and that a cascade from Ral to the exocyst to HGK would be a molecular basis of Ral action on JN.
d cell death 4 (Pdcd4) suppresses neoplastic transformation by inhibiting the activation of c-Jun and consequently AP-1-dependent transcription. We report that Pdcd4 blocks c-Jun activation by inhibiting the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1)/hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1, a kinase upstream of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). cDNA microarray analysis of Pdcd4-overexpressing RKO human colon carcinoma cells revealed MAP4K1 as the sole target of Pdcd4 on the JNK activation pathway. Cotransfection of a MAP4K1 promoter-reporter with Pdcd4 demonstrated inhibition of transcription from the MAP4K1 promoter. Ectopic expression of Pdcd4 in metastatic RKO cells suppressed invasion. MAP4K1 activity is functionally significant in invasion, as overexpression of a dominant negative MAP4K1 (dnMAP4K1) mutant in RKO cells inhibited not only c-Jun activation but also invasion. Overexpression of a MAP4K1 cDNA in Pdcd4-transfected cells rescued the kinase activity of JNK. Thus, Pdcd4 suppresses tumor progression in human colon carcinoma cells by the novel mechanism of down-regulating MAP4K1 transcription, with consequent inhibition of c-Jun activation and AP-1-dependent transcriptio.
an adaptor protein recruited to the plasma membrane upon B cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking in a phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner; however, its physiologic function is unclear. To determine its physiologic function, we produced Bam32-deficient mice. Bam32(-/-) B cells develop normally but have impaired T-independent antibody responses in vivo and diminished responses to BCR crosslinking in vitro. Biochemical analysis revealed that Bam32 acts in a novel pathway leading from the BCR to MAPK/ERK Kinases (MEK1/2), MAPK/ERK Kinase Kinase-1 (MEKK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). This pathway appears to be initiated by hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (HPK1), which interacts directly with Bam32, and differs from all previously characterized BCR signaling pathways in that it is required for normal BCR-mediated proliferation but not for B cell surviva.
etic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a member of germinal center kinases that is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and transiently activated by T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering. We show here that HPK1 supports apoptosis of T cells. When HPK1 was overexpressed in murine CD4(+) T cells, a substantial increase was observed in spontaneous and TCR/CD3-mediated apoptosis as well as in Fas ligand (FasL) expression. In H2O2-treated EL-4 thymoma cells, which show an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis, overexpression of HPK1 enhanced ROS-mediated apoptosis, whereas expression of HPK1 antisense (AS) RNA impaired apoptosis. HPK1 expression also led to a sustained increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, suggesting that JNK activation contributes to the HPK1-mediated apoptosis in H2O2-treated EL-4 cells. Under the same conditions, a rapid cleavage of HPK1 was observed, and overexpression of N- and C-terminal cleavage products in CD4(+) T cells resulted in, similar to full-length HPK1, an increase in apoptosis. In agreement with published data, we show that the C-terminal portion of HPK1 suppresses IkappaBalpha degradation, thereby inhibiting nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. These findings suggest that by inhibiting the antiapoptotic action of NF-kappaB and inducing the proapoptotic activity of JNK, OHPK1 supports apoptosis in T cell.
cellular homolog of v-crk, belongs to a family of adaptor proteins that play a central role in signal transduction cascades. We demonstrate that CrkII interacts directly with c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). A proline-rich sequence of JNK1 is critical for the interaction of the kinase with the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of CrkII. JNK1 is localized with CrkII in membrane ruffles of Crk-overexpressing cells in a Rac1-dependent manner. A JNK1 mutant (K340A) that fails to interact with CrkII is defective in Rac/epidermal growth factor-induced activation, but remains responsive to UVC irradiation. Furthermore, CrkII recruits JNK1 to a p130Cas multiprotein complex where it may be activated through a hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1- and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4-dependent pathway. Together, the results presented here argue for a new mechanism of regulation of the JNK pathway through the CrkII-p130Cas adaptor comple.
e/threonine kinase HPK1 is a member of the germinal center kinase (GCK) family that has been implicated in the regulation of MAP kinase pathways. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of HPK1 in antigen receptor signaling. Engagement of the TCR or the BCR resulted in a marked induction of HPK1 catalytic activity. Subsequent analysis revealed that Src and Syk/ZAP-70 tyrosine kinases and the adaptor proteins LAT, SLP-76, BLNK, Grb2, and Grap are involved in HPK1 activation. Overexpression of HPK1 inhibited TCR activation of AP-1 and ERK2, whereas the kinase-inactive mutant of HPK1 potentiated these responses. Neither form of HPK1 affected PMA or v-Ras activation of AP-1 and ERK2. Thus, HPK1 is a negative regulator of the TCR-induced AP-1 response pathwa.
ing growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-activated kinase (TAK1) is known for its involvement in TGF-beta signaling and its ability to activate the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This report shows that TAK1 is also a strong activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Both the wild-type and a constitutively active mutant of TAK1 stimulated JNK in transient transfection assays. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4)/stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (SEK1), a dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates and activates JNK, synergized with TAK1 in activating JNK. Conversely, a dominant-negative (MKK4/SEK1 mutant inhibited TAK1-induced JNK activation. A kinasedefective mutant of TAK1 effectively suppressed hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (HPK1)-induced JNK activity but had little effect on germinal center kinase activation of JNK. There are two additional MAPK kinase kinases, MEKK1 and mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), that are also downstream of HPK1 and upstream of MKK4/SEK mutant. However, because the dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1 and MLK3 did not inhibit TAK1-induced JNK activity, we conclude that activation of JNK1 by TAK1 is independent of MEKK1 and MLK3. In addition to TAK1, TGF-beta also stimulated JNK activity. Taken together, these results identify TAK1 as a regulator in the HPK1 --&gt; TAK1 --&gt; MKK4/SEK1 --&gt; JNK kinase cascade and indicate the involvement of JNK in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Our results also suggest the potential roles of TAK1 not only in the TGF-beta pathway but also in the other HPK1/JNK1-mediated pathway.
 N-terminal kinase (JNK), or stress-activated protein kinase plays a crucial role in cellular responses stimulated by environmental stress and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms that lead to the activation of the JNK pathway have not been elucidated. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase that has significant sequence similarities to human germinal center kinase (GCK) and human hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1. The novel GCK-like kinase (GLK) has a nucleotide sequence that encodes an ORF of 885 amino acids with 11 kinase subdomains. Endogenous GLK could be activated by UV radiation and proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. When transiently expressed in 293 cells, GLK specifically activated the JNK, but not the p42/44(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 kinase signaling pathways. Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 353-835 in the putative C-terminal regulatory region, or mutation of Lys-35 in the putative ATP-binding domain, markedly reduced the ability of GLK to activate JNK. This result indicates that both kinase activity and the C-terminal region of GLK are required for maximal activation of JNK. Furthermore, GLK-induced JNK activation could be inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4/SAPK/ERK kinase 1 (SEK1), suggesting that GLK may function upstream of MEKK1 in the JNK signaling pathwa.
 amino-terminal kinases (JNKs)/stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) play a crucial role in stress responses in mammalian cells. The mechanism underlying this pathway in the hematopoietic system is unclear, but it is a key in understanding the molecular basis of blood cell differentiation. We have cloned a novel protein kinase, termed hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), that is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, including early progenitor cells. HPK1 is related distantly to the p21(Cdc42/Rac1)-activated kinase (PAK) and yeast STE20 implicated in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Expression of HPK1 activates JNK1 specifically, and it elevates strongly AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity in vivo. HPK1 binds and phosphorylates MEKK1 directly, whereas JNK1 activation by HPK1 is inhibited by a dominant-negative MEKK1 or MKK4/SEK mutant. Interestingly, unlike PAK65, HPK1 does not contain the small GTPase Rac1/Cdc42-binding domain and does not bind to either Rac1 or Cdc42, suggesting that HPK1. activation is Rac1/Cdc42-independent. These results indicate that HPK1 is a novel functional activator of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathwa.
 pathway plays a central role in tissue homoeostasis, and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. Core components of the Hippo pathway include a kinase cascade of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 and the transcription co-activators YAP/TAZ. In response to stimulation, LATS1/2 phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ, the main effectors of the Hippo pathway. Accumulating evidence suggests that MST1/2 are not required for the regulation of YAP/TAZ. Here we show that deletion of LATS1/2 but not MST1/2 abolishes YAP/TAZ phosphorylation. We have identified MAP4K family members-Drosophila Happyhour homologues MAP4K1/2/3 and Misshapen homologues MAP4K4/6/7-as direct LATS1/2-activating kinases. Combined deletion of MAP4Ks and MST1/2, but neither alone, suppresses phosphorylation of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ in response to a wide range of signals. Our results demonstrate that MAP4Ks act in parallel to and are partially redundant with MST1/2 in the regulation of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ, and establish MAP4Ks as components of the expanded Hippo pathwa.
etic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a mammalian Ste20-related protein kinase, is a potent stimulator of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs/JNKs). Here we report activation of NFkappaB transcription factors by HPK1 that was independent of SAPK/JNK activation. Overexpression of a dominant-negative SEK1 significantly inhibited SAPK/JNK activation, whereas NFkappaB stimulation by HPK1 remained unaffected. Furthermore, activation of NFkappaB required the presence of full-length, kinase-active HPK1, whereas the isolated kinase domain of HPK1 was sufficient for activation of SAPK/JNK. We also demonstrate that overexpression of a dominant-negative IKKbeta blocks HPK1-mediated NFkappaB activation suggesting that HPK1 acts upstream of the IkappaB kinase complex. In apoptotic myeloid progenitor cells HPK1 was cleaved at a DDVD motif resulting in the release of the kinase domain and a C-terminal part. Although expression of the isolated HPK1 kinase domain led to SAPK/JNK activation, the C-terminal part inhibited NFkappaB activation. This dominant-negative effect was not only restricted to HPK1-mediated but also to NIK- and tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated NFkappaB activation, suggesting an impairment of the IkappaB kinase complex. Thus HPK1 activates both the SAPK/JNK and NFkappaB pathway in hematopoietic cells but is converted into an inhibitor of NFkappaB activation in apoptotic cell.
ctivated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1, also called hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1, HPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase. As a member of the MAP4K family, MAP4K1 is closely associated with various adaptor proteins such as caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11), hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1 (HS1), HPK1-interacting protein of 55 kD (HIP-55), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) family, the linker for activated T-cells (LAT), SH2 domain containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76) family, homologues of the v-crk oncogene product (CRK) family, the B-cell adaptor molecule of 32 kD (BAM32), etc. It plays important roles in many immunoreactions, such as regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis, inhibition of TCR/BCR signaling and T/B/dendritic cells-mediated immune responses. Thus, MAP4K1 is involved in autoimmune diseases and plays a key role in tumor and inflammatory reactio.
 or uncontrolled B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is associated with autoimmunity. We previously demonstrated a role for actin in BCR signal attenuation. This study reveals that actin-binding protein 1 (Abp1/HIP-55/SH3P7) is a negative regulator of BCR signaling and links actin to negative regulatory pathways of the BCR. In both Abp1(-/-) and bone marrow chimeric mice, in which only B cells lack Abp1 expression, the number of spontaneous germinal center and marginal zone B cells and the level of autoantibody are significantly increased. Serum levels of T-independent antibody responses and total antibody are elevated, whereas T-dependent antibody responses are markedly reduced and fail to undergo affinity maturation. Upon activation, surface BCR clustering is enhanced and B-cell contraction delayed in Abp1(-/-) B cells, concurrent with slow but persistent increases in F-actin at BCR signalosomes. Furthermore, BCR signaling is enhanced in Abp1(-/-) B cells compared with wild-type B cells, including Ca(2+) flux and phosphorylation of B-cell linker protein, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK1/2, and ERK, coinciding with reductions in recruitment of the inhibitory signaling molecules hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 and SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase to BCR signalosomes. Our results indicate that Abp1 negatively regulates BCR signaling by coupling actin remodeling to B-cell contraction and activation of inhibitory signaling molecules, which contributes to the regulation of peripheral B-cell development and antibody response.
ematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 [HPK1]-interacting protein of 55 kDa) is the mammalian homologue of the yeast Abp1p. It contains a C-terminal Src homology 3 domain and an N-terminal actin depolymerization factor (ADF-H/C) domain. HIP-55 appears to be critical for organ development and immune response and is important for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton through its interactions with F-actin and various cytoskeletal and cell signaling proteins. However, the function of HIP-55 in tumors remains unknown. Here, we found that HIP-55 is up-regulated or down-regulated in several types of tumor tissues in patients. Of these, lung cancer tissues had the highest expression of HIP-55. To gain full insight into the function of HIP-55 in lung cancer, microarray assay was performed using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays in both HIP-55 knockdown and scramble control A549 cells. The ingenuity pathway analysis tool was utilized to construct biological networks and analyze functions that might be associated with HIP-55. Functional analysis strongly suggested that HIP-55 may be involved in cancer cell survival and cell death, which was then confirmed by further experimentation. Experimental results showed that downregulation of HIP-55 decreased the viability and increased the apoptosis of A549 cells treated with the anticancer agent etoposide. Our data suggested that HIP-55 may be a newly discovered regulatory node in the growth signaling network and a new target for therapeutic interventions in proliferative disorder.
esent study, hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1)-interacting protein of 55 kDa (HIP-55) protein was over-expressed in HEK293 cells, which was genetically attached with 6x His tag. The protein was purified by nickel-charged resin and was then subjected to tryptic digestion. The phosphorylated peptides within the HIP-55 protein were enriched by TiO2 affinity chromatography, followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Fourteen phosphorylation sites along the primary structure of HIP-55 protein were identified, most of which had not been previously reported. Our results indicate that bio-mass spectrometry coupled with manual interpretation can be used to successfully identify the phosphorylation modification in HIP-55 protein in HEK293 cell.
ember of mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinases, is lost in &gt;95% pancreatic cancer through proteasome-mediated degradation. However, the mechanism of HPK1 loss has not been defined. The aims of this study are to identify the ubiquitin ligase and to examine the mechanisms that targets HPK1 degradation. We found that the CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase targeted HPK1 for degradation via the 26 S proteasome. The ubiquitination of HPK1 required its kinase activity and autophosphorylation. Wild-type protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), but not the phosphatase-dead PP4 mutant, PP4-RL, inhibits the interaction of Fbxw8 with HPK1 and Fbxw8-mediated ubiquitination of HPK1. In addition, we showed that Thr-355 of HPK1 is a key PP4 dephosphorylation site, through which CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase and PP4 regulates HPK1 stability. Knockdown of Fbxw8 restores endogenous HPK1 protein expression and inhibits cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that targeted degradation of HPK1 by the CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase constitutes a negative-feedback loop to restrain the activity of HPK1 and that CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase-mediated HPK1 degradation revealed a direct link and novel role of CUL7/Fbxw8 ubiquitin ligase in the MAPK pathway, which plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiatio.
ssue of Blood, Jakob et al report that hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) participates during signaling of neutrophil recruitment by acting as a regulator of the adhesiveness of the b2-integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) during acute inflammatio.
nt of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to sites of acute inflammation critically depends on β2 integrins (CD11/CD18). Recently, the mammalian actin-binding protein 1 (mAbp1) was identified as an important adaptor protein regulating PMN trafficking downstream of β2 integrins. Here, we show that mAbp1 constitutively co-immunoprecipitated with hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) in neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 (dHL-60) cells. HPK1 was enriched at the lamellipodium of polarized dHL-60 cells, where it colocalized with mAbp1 and actin. Functional analysis of PMNs from HPK1-deficient mice showed that HPK1 was critical for CXCL1-induced lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1)-mediated PMN adhesion to ICAM-1 under flow conditions. Accordingly, CXCL1-mediated induction of high-affinity LFA-1 required HPK1, but macrophage antigen 1 (Mac-1) affinity regulation was independent of HPK1. Intravital microscopy of the mouse cremaster muscle confirmed the defect of CXCL1-induced leukocyte adhesion in HPK1-deficient mice. Furthermore, β2 integrin-mediated post-adhesion processes-adhesion strengthening, spreading, and directed mechanotactic crawling of PMNs under flow conditions-involved HPK1 in vitro and in vivo. Upon intrascrotal administration of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), PMN adhesion and extravasation were severely compromised in HPK1-deficient mice. In summary, our results indicate that HPK1 is critically involved in LFA-1-mediated PMN trafficking during acute inflammatio.
ns are probably the most abundant molecular-recognition modules of the proteome. A common feature of these domains is their interaction with ligand proteins containing Pro-rich sequences. Crystal and NMR structures of SH3 domains complexes with Pro-rich peptides show that the peptide ligands are bound over a range of up to seven residues in a PPII helix conformation. Short proline-rich peptides usually adopt little or no ordered secondary structure before binding interactions, and consequently their association with the SH3 domain is characterized by unfavorable binding entropy due to a loss of rotational freedom on forming the PPII helix. With the aim to stabilize the PPII helix conformation into the proline-rich decapeptide PPPLPPKPKF (P2), we replaced some proline residues either with the 4(R)-4-fluoro-L-proline (FPro) or the 4(R)-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp). The interactions of P2 analogues with the SH3 domain of cortactin (SH3(m-cort)) were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, while CD thermal transition experiments have been used to determine their propensity to adopt a PPII helix conformation. Results show that the introduction of three residues of Hyp efficiently stabilizes the PPII helix conformation, while it does not improve the affinity towards the SH3 domain, suggesting that additional forces, e.g., electrostatic interactions, are involved in the SH3(m-cort) substrate recognitio.
unction is known to be essential for cell death by apoptosis, but it is now increasingly recognized that these proteases also play important roles in other cellular events. Here we report for the first time that inhibition of cellular caspase activity can induce differentiation of AML blasts, and can enhance vitamin D-induced cell differentiation of these cells. This was studied in blasts obtained from nine patients with AML and one patient with CML by ex vivo culture in the presence of Q-VD-OPh (QVD), a pan caspase inhibitor. Cell differentiation was manifested by the expression of markers of monocytic differentiation CD11b and CD14. Differentiation induced by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) or its analogs PRI-1906 and PRI-2191 was enhanced by QVD to a varying degree, depending on the subtype of the leukemia. QVD and 1,25D-induced differentiation was accompanied by increased signaling by Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase 1(HPK1), and the expression of transcription factors known to be involved in monocytic differentiation was increased. Although the magnitude and nature of these changes were not invariable, it is clear that caspase inhibitors warrant attention as components of differentiation therapy of leukemia, perhaps in combination with derivatives of vitamin .
ng the appropriate drug targets for the development of a novel anti-tumor immunotherapy is one of the most risky steps in the drug development cycle. We have identified a hematopoietic cell-restricted serine/threonine kinase, hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), as a possible target for therapeutic intervention. Targeted disruption of HPK1 alleles confers T cells with an elevated Th1 cytokine production in response to TCR engagement. HPK1 (-/-) T cells proliferate more rapidly than the haplotype-matched wild-type counterpart and are resistant to prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2))-mediated suppression. Most strikingly, mice that received adoptive transfer of HPK1 (-/-) T cells became resistant to lung tumor growth. Also, the loss of HPK1 from dendritic cells (DCs) endows them with superior antigen presentation ability, enabling HPK1 (-/-) DCs to elicit a more potent anti-tumor immune response when used as cancer vaccine. It is probable that blocking the HPK1 kinase activity with a small molecule inhibitor may activate the superior anti-tumor activity of both cell types, resulting in a synergistic amplification of anti-tumor potential. Given that HPK1 is not expressed in any major organs, it is less likely that an inhibitor of HPK1 kinase activity would cause any serious side effect.
etic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is a Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase that suppresses immune responses and autoimmunity. B cell receptor (BCR) signaling activates HPK1 by inducing BLNK/HPK1 interaction. Whether HPK1 can reciprocally regulate BLNK during BCR signaling is unknown. Here, we show that HPK1-deficient B cells display hyper-proliferation and hyper-activation of IκB kinase and MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) upon the ligation of BCR. HPK1 attenuates BCR-induced cell activation via inducing BLNK threonine 152 phosphorylation, which mediates BLNK/14-3-3 binding. Furthermore, threonine 152-phosphorylated BLNK is ubiquitinated at lysine residues 37, 38, and 42, leading to attenuation of MAPK and IκB kinase activation in B cells during BCR signaling. These results reveal a novel negative feedback regulation of BCR signaling by HPK1-mediated phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of the activated BLN.
ecognition within immunological synapses triggers and sustains T cell activation by nucleating protein microclusters that gather T cell receptors (TCRs), kinases, and adaptors. Dissipation of these microclusters results in signal termination, but how this process is regulated is unclear. In this paper, we reveal that release of the adaptors SLP76 and GADS from signaling microclusters is induced by the serine/threonine protein kinase HPK1 and that phosphorylation of GADS plays a major role in this process. We found that HPK1 was recruited into microclusters and triggered their dissipation by inducing the phosphorylation of a threonine-containing motif of GADS, together with the previously described serine phosphorylation of SLP76. These events induced the cooperative binding of 14-3-3 proteins to SLP76-GADS complexes, leading to their uncoupling from the transmembrane adaptor LAT and consequently reducing microcluster persistence and activation-induced gene transcription. These results demonstrate that serine/threonine phosphorylation of multiple TCR-proximal effectors controls the stability of signaling microclusters, thereby determining the intensity of T cell response.
lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by T cell overactivation and B cell hyper-stimulation. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1, also called MAP4K1) negatively regulates T cell-mediated immune responses. However, the role of HPK1 and the mechanisms that regulate HPK1 expression in SLE remain poorly understood. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) microarray data, we identified markedly increased histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) enrichment at the HPK1 promoter of SLE CD4+ T cells relative to controls, and confirmed this observation using ChIP and real-time PCR experiments. We further found that HPK1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells of patients with SLE, and that this decrease was not caused by exposure to standard SLE medications. Down-regulating HPK1 in healthy CD4+ T cells significantly accelerated T cell proliferation and production of IFNγ and IgG. Consistent with these findings, overexpressing HPK1 in SLE CD4+ T cells caused a significant decrease in T cell reactivity. In addition, we observed a striking decrease in jumonji domain containing 3 (JMJD3) binding, but no marked change in enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) binding, at the HPK1 promoter region in SLE CD4+ T cells compared to healthy controls. SiRNA knock down of JMJD3 in healthy CD4+ T cells led to decreased JMJD3 binding and increased H3K27me3 enrichment at the HPK1 promoter region, thus inhibiting the expression of HPK1. Concordantly, plasmid-induced overexpression of JMJD3 in SLE CD4+ T cells led to increased JMJD3 binding, decreased H3K27me3 enrichment, and up-regulated HPK1 expression. Our results show for the first time that inhibited HPK1 expression in SLE CD4+ T cells is associated with loss of JMJD3 binding and increased H3K27me3 enrichment at the HPK1 promoter, contributing to T cell overactivation and B cell overstimulation in SLE. These findings suggest that HPK1 may serve as a novel target for effective SLE therap.
microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in cancer development. In this study, we report that hsa-miR-96 is expressed at higher levels in human bladder urothelial carcinomas compared to normal tissues. We found that hsa-miR-96 increased invasion and differentiation of human bladder T24 cells and promoted their growth. Down&#8209;regulation of hsa-miR-96 significantly affected the phenotype of bladder cancer T24 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and MAP4K1 were significantly reduced in cells transfected with the hsa-miR-96 inhibitor when compared with levels in cells transfected with the empty plasmid vector or the negative control miRNA inhibitor. Altogether, these results suggest that hsa-miR-96 may affect the growth of bladder cancer cells by up-regulating IRS1 and MAP4K1 levels, functioning as a promising diagnostic marker in human bladder urothelial carcinoma.
opoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) signals into MAPK and NFκB pathways downstream of immunoreceptors, but enigmatically is a negative regulator of leukocytes. Here, we report a novel role for HPK1 in regulating the activation of the adhesion molecule leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). Upon TCR stimulation, mediated by binding of adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein (ADAP) to SLP-76, a ternary complex composed of ADAP/55-kDa src kinase associated phosphoprotein (SKAP-55) and RIAM translocates to the membrane and causes membrane recruitment of the active small GTPase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). Active Rap1, via its binding to RapL (regulator for cell adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues), mediates LFA-1 integrin activation. We show here that HPK1, which also binds SLP-76, compete with ADAP for SLP-76 binding. In addition, HPK1 dampens Rap1 activation, resulting in decreased LFA-1 activity. Analysis of HPK1-deficient T cells revealed increased ADAP recruitment to SLP-76 and elevated Rap1 activation in those cells, leading to increased adhesion to ICAM-1 and cell spreading. Altogether, these results describe a novel function for HPK1 in linking TCR signaling to cell adhesion regulation and provide a mechanistic explanation for the negative regulatory role of HPK1 in T-cell biolog.
hila and mammals, the canonical Hippo kinase cascade is mediated by Hpo/Mst acting through the intermediary kinase Wts/Lats to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator Yki/YAP/TAZ. Despite recent reports linking Yki/YAP/TAZ activity to the actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and/or controversial. Using Drosophila imaginal discs as an in&nbsp;vivo model, we show that Wts, but not Hpo, is genetically indispensable for cytoskeleton-mediated subcellular localization of Yki. Through a systematic screen, we identify the Ste-20 kinase Happyhour (Hppy) and its mammalian counterpart MAP4K1/2/3/5 as an alternative kinase that phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Wts/Lats in a similar manner as Hpo/Mst. Consistent with their redundant function as activating kinases of Wts/Lats, combined loss of Hpo/Mst and Hppy/MAP4K abolishes cytoskeleton-mediated regulation of Yki/YAP subcellular localization, as well as YAP cytoplasmic translocation induced by contact inhibition. These Hpo/Mst-like kinases provide an expanded view of the Hippo kinase cascade in development and physiolog.
se of this study is to identify protein kinase genes that modulate oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in vitro and evaluate the roles of these genes in predicting clinical outcomes in CRC patients receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. A high-throughput RNAi screening targeting 626 human kinase genes was performed to identify kinase genes whose inhibition potentiates oxaliplatin sensitivity in CRC cells. The associations between copy numbers of the candidate genes and recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed in 142 stage III CRC patients receiving first-line oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy who were enrolled from two independent hospitals. HT-RNAi screening identified 40 kinase genes whose inhibition potentiated oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in DLD1 cells. The relative copy number (RCN) of MAP4K1 and CDKL4 were associated with increased risks of both recurrence and death. Moreover, significant genes-based risk score and the ratios of RCN of different genes can further categorize patients into subgroups with distinctly differing outcomes. The estimated AUC for the prediction models including clinical variables plus kinase biomarkers was 0.77 for the recurrence and 0.82 for the survival models. The copy numbers of MAP4K1 and CDKL4 can predict clinical outcomes in CRC patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherap.
cognition of minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) plays an important role in the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, the number of MiHA identified to date remains limited, making clinical application of MiHA reactive T-cell infusion difficult. This study represents the first attempt of genome-wide prediction of MiHA, coupled to the isolation of T-cell populations that react with these antigens. In this unbiased high-throughput MiHA screen, both the possibilities and pitfalls of this approach were investigated. First, 973 polymorphic peptides expressed by hematopoietic stem cells were predicted and screened for HLA-A2 binding. Subsequently a set of 333 high affinity HLA-A2 ligands was identified and post transplantation samples from allo-SCT patients were screened for T-cell reactivity by a combination of pMHC-tetramer-based enrichment and multi-color flow cytometry. Using this approach, 71 peptide-reactive T-cell populations were generated. The isolation of a T-cell line specifically recognizing target cells expressing the MAP4K1(IMA) antigen demonstrates that identification of MiHA through this approach is in principle feasible. However, with the exception of the known MiHA HMHA1, none of the other T-cell populations that were generated demonstrated recognition of endogenously MiHA expressing target cells, even though recognition of peptide-loaded targets was often apparent. Collectively these results demonstrate the technical feasibility of high-throughput analysis of antigen-specific T-cell responses in small patient samples. However, the high-sensitivity of this approach requires the use of potential epitope sets that are not solely based on MHC binding, to prevent the frequent detection of T-cell responses that lack biological relevanc.
astoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumour in children, is characterised by a high risk of leptomeningeal dissemination. But little is known about the molecular mechanisms that promote cancer cell migration in MB. Aberrant expression of miR-21 is recognised to be causatively linked to metastasis in a variety of human neoplasms including brain tumours; however its function in MB is still unknown. In this study we investigated the expression level and the role of miR-21 in MB cell migration. miR-21 was found to be up-regulated, compared to normal cerebellum, in 29/29 MB primary samples and 6/6 MB-derived cell lines. Inverse correlation was observed between miR-21 expression and the metastasis suppressor PDCD4, while miR-21 repression increased the release of PDCD4 protein, suggesting negative regulation of PDCD4 by miR-21 in MB cells. Anti-miR-21 decreased protein expression of the tumour cell invasion mediators MAP4K1 and JNK, which are also known to be negatively regulated by PDCD4, and down-regulated integrin protein that is essential for MB leptomeningeal dissemination. Moreover miR-21 knockdown in MB cells increased the expression of two eminent negative modulators of cancer cell migration, E-Cadherin and TIMP2 proteins that are known to be positively regulated by PDCD4. Finally and importantly, suppression of miR-21 decreased the motility of MB cells and reduced their migration across basement membranes in vitro. Together, these compelling data propose miR-21 pathway as a novel mechanism impacting MB cell dissemination and raises the possibility that curability of selected MB may be improved by pharmaceutical strategies directed towards microRNA-2.
ssion of carcino-embryonic antigen by colorectal cancer is an example of oncogenic activation of embryonic gene expression. Hypothesizing that oncogenesis-recapitulating-ontogenesis may represent a broad programmatic commitment, we compared gene expression patterns of human colorectal cancers (CRCs) and mouse colon tumor models to those of mouse colon development embryonic days 13.5-18..
 here that 39 colon tumors from four independent mouse models and 100 human CRCs encompassing all clinical stages shared a striking recapitulation of embryonic colon gene expression. Compared to normal adult colon, all mouse and human tumors over-expressed a large cluster of genes highly enriched for functional association to the control of cell cycle progression, proliferation, and migration, including those encoding MYC, AKT2, PLK1 and SPARC. Mouse tumors positive for nuclear beta-catenin shifted the shared embryonic pattern to that of early development. Human and mouse tumors differed from normal embryonic colon by their loss of expression modules enriched for tumor suppressors (EDNRB, HSPE, KIT and LSP1). Human CRC adenocarcinomas lost an additional suppressor module (IGFBP4, MAP4K1, PDGFRA, STAB1 and WNT4). Many human tumor samples also gained expression of a coordinately regulated module associated with advanced malignancy (ABCC1, FOXO3A, LIF, PIK3R1, PRNP, TNC, TIMP3 and VEGF.
cies, developmental, and multi-model gene expression patterning comparisons provide an integrated and versatile framework for definition of transcriptional programs associated with oncogenesis. This approach also provides a general method for identifying pattern-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This delineation and categorization of developmental and non-developmental activator and suppressor gene modules can thus facilitate the formulation of sophisticated hypotheses to evaluate potential synergistic effects of targeting within- and between-modules for next-generation combinatorial therapeutics and improved mouse model.
etic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1 or MAP4K1) is a hematopoietic-specific mammalian STE20-like protein serine/threonine kinase, comprised of a STE20-like kinase domain in its N-terminus, four proline-rich motifs, a caspase cleavage site, and a distal C-terminal Citron homology domain. HPK1 is involved in many cellular signaling cascades that include MAPK signaling, antigen receptor signaling, apoptosis, growth factor signaling, and cytokine signaling. HPK1 binds many adaptor proteins including members of the Grb2 family, Nck family, Crk family, SLP-76 family, and actin-binding adaptors like HIP-55. HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activation depend on the presence of adaptor proteins. Adaptor proteins are required not only for linking HPK1 to cell surface receptors like the EGFR, but also for downstream gene transcription like NFAT, AP-1 and IL-2. The HPK1 association with Crk, CrkL, and HIP-55 mediate HPK1-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, while the association of HPK1 with SLP-76, Gads, CrkL, Grb2, and Grap affect T- and B-cell dependent gene transcription. Interestingly, HPK1 has been implicated in both increasing and decreasing NFAT, AP-1, and IL-2 gene transcription in T-cells where adaptor proteins play a key role. Lastly, HPK1 will phosphorylate Crk and CrkL, in vitro, which presents a novel possibility for the regulation of adaptor proteins and downstream signaling event.
ons with the bone marrow microenvironment are essential for leukemia survival and disease progression. We developed an imaging-based RNAi platform to identify protective cues from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) that promote survival of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Using a candidate gene approach, we detected distinct responses of individual ALL cases to RNA interference with stromal targets. The strongest effects were observed when interfering with solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) expression, which forms the cystine transporter xc- when associated with SLC7A11. Import of cystine and metabolism to cysteine by stromal cells provides the limiting substrate to generate and maintain glutathione in ALL. This metabolic interaction reduces oxidative stress in ALL cells that depend on stromal xc-. Indeed, cysteine depletion using cysteine dioxygenase resulted in leukemia cell death. Thus, functional evaluation of intercellular interactions between leukemia cells and their microenvironment identifies a selective dependency of ALL cells on stromal metabolism for a relevant subgroup of cases, providing new opportunities to develop more personalized approaches to leukemia treatmen.
 range of lipid oxidation products detected in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and atherosclerotic lesions are capable of eliciting biological responses in vascular cells. We performed DNA microarray experiments to explore novel responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to oxLDL and its component.
oarray analysis showed that oxLDL, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and oxysterols altered gene expression specifically, but some genes were commonly induced in HUVECs. Solute carrier family 3 member 2 and family 7 member 5, encoding the heavy chain of the cell surface antigen 4F2 (4F2hc) and the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), respectively, were induced by oxLDL and many oxidation products. LAT1 requires 4F2hc to form a heterodimeric functional complex to transport neutral amino acids into the cell. LysoPC increased membrane protein levels of LAT1 confirmed by Western blot analysis and also uptake of L-[(14)C]leucine, which was inhibited by a competitive inhibitor for LAT1. The release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 was increased in LysoPC-treated cells and was attenuated by the LAT1 inhibito.
dings suggest that an increase in uptake of neutral amino acids induced by LysoPC results in enhancement of inflammatory responses of endothelial cell.
r recognition of antigens presented by the MHC, T cell proliferation is vital for clonal expansion and the acquisition of effector functions, which are essential for mounting adaptive immune responses. The CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc, Slc3a2) plays a crucial role in the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, although it is unclear if CD98hc directly regulates the T cell effector functions that are not linked with T cell proliferation in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that CD98hc is required for both CD4+ T cell proliferation and Th1 functional differentiation. T cell-specific deletion of CD98hc did not affect T cell development in the thymus. CD98hc-deficient CD4+ T cells proliferated in vivo more slowly as compared with control T cells. C57BL/6 mice lacking CD98hc in their CD4+ T cells could not control Leishmania major infections due to lowered IFN-γ production, even with massive CD4+ T cell proliferation. CD98hc-deficient CD4+ T cells exhibited lower IFN-γ production compared with wild-type T cells, even when comparing IFN-γ expression in cells that underwent the same number of cell divisions. Therefore, these data indicate that CD98hc is required for CD4+ T cell expansion and functional Th1 differentiation in vivo, and suggest that CD98hc might be a good target for treating Th1-mediated immune disorder.
 daily-used seasoning for promoting appetite, is widely used in folk medicine for treating gastrointestinal diseases. Piperine is the major alkaloid in pepper and possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, the mechanism for linking metabolic and medicinal activities of piperine remains unknown. Here we report that piperine robustly boosts mTORC1 activity by recruiting more system L1 amino acid transporter (SLC7A5/SLC3A2) to the cell membrane, thus promoting amino acid metabolism. Piperine-induced increase of mTORC1 activity in resident peritoneal macrophages (pMΦs) is correlated with enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-α upon LPS stimulation. Such an enhancement of cytokine production could be abrogated by inhibitors of the mTOR signaling pathway, indicating mTOR's action in this process. Moreover, piperine treatment protected resident pMΦs from bacterium-induced apoptosis and disappearance, and increased their bacterial phagocytic ability. Consequently, piperine administration conferred mice resistance against bacterial infection and even sepsis. Our data highlight that piperine has the capacity to metabolically reprogram peritoneal resident macrophages to fortify their innate functions against bacterial infectio.
7A5) and CD98 (SLC3A2) constitute a heterodimeric transmembrane protein complex that catalyzes amino acid transport. Whether one or both subunits are competent for transport is still unclear. The present work aims to solve this question using different experimental strategies. Firstly, LAT1 and CD98 were immuno-detected in protein extracts from SiHa cells. Under oxidizing conditions, i.e., without addition of SH (thiol) reducing agent DTE, both proteins were revealed as a 120kDa major band. Upon DTE treatment separated bands, corresponding to LAT1(35kDa) or CD98(80kDa), were detected. LAT1 function was evaluated in intact cells as BCH sensitive [(3)H]His transport inhibited by hydrophobic amino acids. Antiport of [(3)H]His was measured in proteoliposomes reconstituted with SiHa cell extract in presence of internal His. Transport was increased by DTE. Hydrophobic amino acids were best inhibitors in addition to hydrophilic Tyr, Gln, Asn and Lys. Cys, Tyr and Gln, included in the intraliposomal space, were transported in antiport with external [(3)H]His. Similar experiments were performed in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the recombinant purified hLAT1. Results overlapping those obtained with native protein were achieved. Lower transport of [(3)H]Leu and [(3)H]Gln with respect to [(3)H]His was detected. Kinetic asymmetry was found with external Km for His lower than internal one. No transport was detected in proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant hCD98. The experimental data demonstrate that LAT1 is the sole transport competent subunit of the heterodimer. This conclusion has important outcome for following studies on functional characterization and identification of specific inhibitors with potential application in human therap.
tives of this study were to (1) identify changes in plasma and mammary intracellular amino acid (AA) profiles in dairy cows treated with growth hormone (GH), and (2) evaluate the expression of mammary gland genes involved in the transport of AA identified in (1). Eight non-pregnant (n = 4 per group) lactating dairy cows were treated with a single subcutaneous injection of either a slow-release formulation of commercially available GH (Lactotropin 500 mg) or physiological saline solution. Six days after treatment, cows were milked and blood collected from the jugular vein for the analysis of free AA in the plasma. Cows were euthanized and mammary tissue harvested. Treatment with GH increased milk, protein, fat and lactose yields, with no effect on dry matter intake. Plasma concentrations of lysine and group I AA decreased significantly, and arginine, methionine, tyrosine and arginine-family AA tended to decrease in GH-treated cows. Concentrations of intracellular glycine, serine and glutamate increased significantly, with a trend for decreased arginine observed in the mammary gland of GH-treated cows. A trend for increased concentrations of intracellular total AA, NEAA and arginine-family AA were observed in the mammary gland of GH-treated cows. Variance in the concentration of plasma methionine, tyrosine, valine, alanine, ornithine, BCAA, EAA was significantly different between treatments. Variance in the concentration of intracellular lysine, valine, glutamine, EAA and group II was significantly different between treatments. AA changes were associated with increased mRNA abundance of the mammary gland AA transporter SLC3A2. We propose that these changes occur to support increased milk protein and fatty acid production in the mammary gland of GH-treated cows via potential mTOR pathway signalin.
 380,000 new cases of bladder cancer are diagnosed worldwide, accounting for ∼150,200 deaths each year. To discover potential biomarkers of bladder cancer, we employed a strategy combining laser microdissection, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling, and liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis to profile proteomic changes in fresh-frozen bladder tumor specimens. Cellular proteins from four pairs of surgically resected primary bladder cancer tumor and adjacent nontumorous tissue were extracted for use in two batches of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation experiments, which identified a total of 3220 proteins. A DAVID (database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery) analysis of dysregulated proteins revealed that the three top-ranking biological processes were extracellular matrix organization, extracellular structure organization, and oxidation-reduction. Biological processes including response to organic substances, response to metal ions, and response to inorganic substances were highlighted by up-expressed proteins in bladder cancer. Seven differentially expressed proteins were selected as potential bladder cancer biomarkers for further verification. Immunohistochemical analyses showed significantly elevated levels of three proteins-SLC3A2, STMN1, and TAGLN2-in tumor cells compared with noncancerous bladder epithelial cells, and suggested that TAGLN2 could be a useful tumor tissue marker for diagnosis (AUC = 0.999) and evaluating lymph node metastasis in bladder cancer patients. ELISA results revealed significantly increased urinary levels of both STMN1 and TAGLN2 in bladder cancer subgroups compared with control groups. In comparisons with age-matched hernia urine specimens, urinary TAGLN2 in bladder cancer samples showed the largest fold change (7.13-fold), with an area-under-the-curve value of 0.70 (p &lt; 0.001, n = 205). Overall, TAGLN2 showed the most significant overexpression in individual bladder cancer tissues and urine specimens, and thus represents a potential biomarker for noninvasive screening for bladder cancer. Our findings highlight the value of bladder tissue proteome in providing valuable information for future validation studies of potential biomarkers in urothelial carcinom.
n colonic epithelial barrier defenses are associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). The proteins that regulate bacterial clearance in the colonic epithelium have not been completely identified. The Drosophila chromosome-associated protein D3 (dCAP-D3) regulates responses to bacterial infection. We examined whether CAP-D3 promotes bacterial clearance in human colonic epitheliu.
 of Salmonella or adherent-invasive Escherichia coli LF82 was assessed by gentamycin protection assays in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells expressing small hairpin RNAs against CAP-D3. We used immunoblot assays to measure levels of CAP-D3 in colonic epithelial cells from patients with UC and healthy individuals (controls). RNA sequencing identified genes activated by CAP-D3. We analyzed the roles of CAP-D3 target genes in bacterial clearance using gentamycin protection and immunofluorescence assays and studies with pharmacologic inhibitor.
pression was reduced in colonic epithelial cells from patients with active UC. Reduced CAP-D3 expression decreased autophagy and impaired intracellular bacterial clearance by HT-29 and Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells. Lower levels of CAP-D3 increased transcription of genes encoding SLC7A5 and SLC3A2, the products of which heterodimerize to form an amino acid transporter in HT-29 cells after bacterial infection; levels of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 were increased in tissues from patients with UC compared with controls. Reduced CAP-D3 in HT-29 cells resulted in earlier recruitment of SLC7A5 to Salmonella-containing vacuoles, increased activity of mTORC1, and increased survival of bacteria. Inhibition of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 or mTORC1 activity rescued the bacterial clearance defects of CAP-D3-deficient cell.
wn-regulates transcription of genes that encode amino acid transporters (SLC7A5 and SLC3A2) to promote bacterial autophagy by colon epithelial cells. Levels of CAP-D3 protein are reduced in patients with active UC; strategies to increase its levels might restore mucosal homeostasis to patients with active U.
ymphoma (BL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children worldwide and the most common paediatric malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa. The endemic (eBL) and sporadic (sBL) variants have distinct epidemiologic and virologic characteristics. Although gene expression studies have defined the transcriptional profiles of both, their proteomic signatures have not been studie.
ed the proteomic expression profiles using differential mass spectrometry-based isotope tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis of a cell line representing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ eBL, EBV+ and EBV- sBL, and EBV+/- normal B cells from healthy donor.
 there were 144 differentially expressed proteins with a statistically significant false discovery rate (FDR) of ⩽0.2. Results revealed over-expression of specific proteins with well-established links to lymphomagenesis such as TUBB2C (FDR 0.05), UCHL1 (FDR 0.05) and HSP90AB1 (FDR 0.1). Distinct characteristics based upon the epidemiologic and virologic subtypes of BL were also identified. In sBL, PCNA (FDR 0.05) and SLC3A2 (FDR 0.1) were significantly over-expressed. In eBL, C1QBP (FDR 0.1) and ENO1 (FDR 0.25) were significantly over-expressed. Comparison of EBV+ to EBV- BL cell lines and B cells revealed significant over-expression of DDX3X (FDR 0.1). Proteins were validated using Western blot analysi.
ts suggest unique signal transduction pathways associated with EBV infection and epidemiological subtype of BL that may contribute to lymphomagenesis. These proteomic findings provide potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic links to B.
roethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) labeled with fluorine-18 is an important and specific tracer for diagnostics of glioblastoma via positron emission tomography (PET). However, the mechanism of its quite specific accumulation in tumor tissue has not been understood so far. In this work we demonstrate that [(3)H]L-tyrosine is primarily transported by the system L transporter LAT1 in human LN229 glioblastoma cells. FET reduced tyrosine transport, suggesting that it shares the same uptake pathway. More importantly, accumulation of FET was significantly reduced after siRNA-mediated downregulation of LAT1. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human LAT1 together with the glycoprotein 4F2hc (necessary to pull LAT-1 to the plasma membrane) exhibited a similar accumulation of FET as observed in glioblastoma cells. In contrast, no accumulation was observed in control oocytes, not overexpressing an exogenous transporter. Because LAT1 works exclusively as an exchanger of amino acids, substrates at one side of the membrane stimulate exchange against substrates at the other side. Extracellular FET stimulated the efflux of intracellular [(3)H]L-leucine, demonstrating that FET&nbsp;is indeed an influx substrate for LAT1. However, FET injected into oocytes was not able to stimulate uptake of extracellular [(3)H]L-leucine, indicating that FET is not a good efflux substrate. Our data, therefore, suggest that FET is trapped within cells due to the asymmetry of its intra- and extracellular recognition by LAT1. If also found for other transporters in tumor cells, asymmetric substrate recognition may be further exploited for tumor-specific accumulation of PET-tracers and/or other tumor-related drug.
LC3A2) is the heavy chain component of the dimeric transmembrane glycoprotein CD98, which comprises the large neutral amino acid transporter LAT1 (SLC7A5) in cells. Overexpression of CD98hc occurs widely in cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis clinically, but its exact contributions to tumorigenesis are uncertain. In this study, we showed that genetic deficiency of CD98hc protects against Ras-driven skin carcinogenesis. Deleting CD98hc after tumor induction was also sufficient to cause regression of existing tumors. Investigations into the basis for these effects defined two new functions of CD98hc that contribute to epithelial cancer beyond an intrinsic effect of CD98hc on tumor cell proliferation. First, CD98hc increased the stiffness of the tumor microenvironment. Second, CD98hc amplified the capacity of cells to respond to matrix rigidity, an essential factor in tumor development. Mechanistically, CD98hc mediated this stiffness sensing by increasing Rho kinase (ROCK) activity, resulting in increased transcription mediated by YAP/TAZ, a nuclear relay for mechanical signals. Our results suggest that CD98hc contributes to carcinogenesis by amplifying a positive feedback loop, which increases both extracellular matrix stiffness and resulting cellular responses. This work supports a rationale to explore the use of CD98hc inhibitors as cancer therapeutic.
en reported that CD147 and CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) form a complex on the cell plasma membrane of several cancers; however, whether this complex exists in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and affects the prognosis of patients remains to be elucidate.
ssion of CD147 and CD98hc was assessed in tissue samples from 241 NSCLC patients and NSCLC cell lines. The correlation between CD147 and CD98hc expression and their association with the prognosis of NSCLC patients were analyzed. We also evaluated the impact of CD147 and CD98hc on the growth of NSCLC cells as well as Akt phosphorylatio.
7 and CD98hc were significantly upregulated in NSCLC cells, and their expression levels were significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.001). Immunoflurenece staining and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that CD147 and CD98hc could form a complex on NSCLC cells. Compared with NSCLC patients with CD147-/CD98hc-, those with CD147+/CD98hc+ exhibited a significantly poor overall survival (OS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.92 (p = 0.010), and a significantly increased risk of recurrence with a HR of 1.97 (p = 0.004). Also, we demonstrated that the proliferation of lung cancer cell lines was significantly affected by knockdown and force-expression of the CD147-CD98hc complex. Western blot analysis indicated that the phosphorylation of Akt in NSCLC cells was significantly affected by knockdown and overexpression of either or both CD147 and CD98h.
ngs indicate that the CD147-CD98hc complex significantly contributes to poor prognosis of NSCLC patients through promoting cell proliferation via the PI3K/Akt pathwa.
(L-DOPA) is the naturally occurring precursor amino acid for dopamine and the main therapeutic agent for neurologic disorders due to dopamine depletion, such as Parkinson's disease. l-DOPA absorption in small intestine has been suggested to be mediated by the large neutral amino acids transport machinery, but the identity of the involved transporters is unknown. Clinically, coadministration of l-DOPA and dietary amino acids is avoided to decrease competition for transport in intestine and at the blood-brain barrier. l-DOPA is routinely coadministered with levodopa metabolism inhibitors (dopa-decarboxylase and cathechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors) that share structural similarity with levodopa. In this systematic study involving Xenopus laevis oocytes and Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelia expression systems and ex vivo preparations from wild-type and knockout mice, we identified the neutral and dibasic amino acids exchanger (antiporter) b(0,+)AT-rBAT (SLC7A9-SLC3A1) as the luminal intestinal l-DOPA transporter. The major luminal cotransporter (symporter) B(0)AT1 (SLC6A19) was not involved in levodopa transport. L-Leucine and L-arginine competed with levodopa across the luminal enterocyte membrane as expected for b(0,+)AT-rBAT substrates, whereas dopa-decarboxylase and cathechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors had no effect. The presence of amino acids in the basolateral compartment mimicking the postprandial phase increased transepithelial levodopa transport by stimulating basolateral efflux via the antiporter LAT2-4F2 (SLC7A8-SLC3A2). Additionally, the aromatic amino acid uniporter TAT1 (SLC16A10) was shown to play a major role in l-DOPA efflux from intestinal enterocytes. These results identify the molecular mechanisms mediating small intestinal levodopa absorption and suggest strategies for optimization of delivery and absorption of this important prodru.
t amino acid transport activity (AAT) is indispensable for appropriate fetal growth. Studies suggest that placental nutrient uptake activity is responsive to both maternal and fetal nutrient demands. We hypothesize that under conditions of limited nutrient availability to the fetus, as often present in preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and insufficient weight-gain during pregnancy, a general adaptive response aimed to increase amino acid transport activity may be observed in the placent.
f 40 placentas from full-term (n = 10) and pre-term (average gestational period = 34.8 weeks, n = 10) normal pregnancies, IUGR (n = 10), and preeclampsia (n = 10) associated pregnancies were looked at by immunohistochemistry followed by relative qualitative scoring to compare expression levels and localization of System L, ASCT2, and mTOR protein.
ous syncytiotrophoblast (ST) in placenta of pregnancies complicated by IUGR or preeclampsia (PE) showed significant increases in the levels of System L amino acid transport proteins 4F2hc and LAT1 compared to both full-term control and pre-term (early gestation control) pregnancies seperately (p &lt; 0.05). Elevated mTOR protein was uniquely higher in IUGR placentas compared to full-term controls (P = 0.0026). Total cellular ASCT2 transporter protein levels were similar in all groups, however, levels of ASCT2 protein localized to the ST microvillous membrane (MVM) were significantly lower in IUGR compared to both full-term and pre-term pregnancies (P = 0.0006, 0.03, respectively). Additionally, ASCT2 and mTOR protein levels were positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (P = 0.046, 0.048, respectively.
 three important findings based upon the present study. First, in conditions of limited nutrient availability, such as PE or IUGR, there is an overall increase in the level of System L and mTOR protein expression in the ST, suggestive of an adaptive response. Second, a decrease in ASCT2 protein at the ST MVM suggests a post-translational event that may decrease AAT activity in IUGR placentas. Third, a physiological link between transporter expression and pre-pregnancy BMI is suggested based upon a positive association observed with ASCT2 and mTOR expression value.
 cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and only a few molecular markers may be potentially used to predict the risk of progression. This study aims to assess the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CD98 gene on prognosis of NSCLC patients. We genotyped three potential functional SNPs in CD98 gene using Sequenom iPLEX genotyping system in a cohort of 482 NSCLC patients. Multivariate cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used for the survival analysis. The variant-containing genotypes of rs1059292 in 5'-flanking region of CD98 gene were significantly associated with an increased risk of death in the multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.04-2.14 in a dominant model). In stratified analysis, the association remained significant in patients with poor differentiation (HR=1.81, 95% CI=1.01-3.25). In addition, rs1059292 also showed a borderline significant association with T stage (OR=1.49; 95% CI: 0.96-2.35) and N stage (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 0.98-2.39). Functional analysis demonstrated that variant genotype of SNP rs1059292 significantly enhanced the transcription activity of CD98 gene promoter. Our data suggest that genetic variation of rs1059292 in CD98 gene may affect clinical outcome of NSCLC in Chinese populatio.
d transporters are necessary for the tumour cell growth and survival, and have a crucial role in the development and invasiveness of cancer cells. But, it remains unclear about the prognostic significance of L-type amino-acid transporter 1 (LAT1), system ASC amino-acid transporter-2 (ASCT2), and xCT expression in patients with tongue cancer. We conducted the clinicopathological study to investigate the protein expression of these amino-acid transporters in tongue cance.
ve patients with surgically resected tongue cancer were evaluated. Tumour sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for LAT1, ASCT2, xCT, 4F2hc/CD98hc (4F2hc), Ki-67, and microvessel density (MVD) determined by CD34, and p5.
ino-acid transporter 1 and 4F2hc were highly expressed in 61% (52 out of 85) and 45% (38 out of 47), respectively. ASC amino-acid transporter-2 and xCT were positively expressed in 59% (50 out of 85) and 21% (18 out of 85), respectively. The expression of both LAT1 and ASCT2 was significantly associated with disease staging, lymph-node metastasis, lymphatic permeation, 4F2hc expression and cell proliferation (Ki-67). xCT expression indicated a significant association with advanced stage and tumour factor. By univariate analysis, disease staging, lymphatic permeation, vascular invasion, LAT1, ASCT2, 4F2hc, and Ki-67 had a significant relationship with overall survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that LAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting poor prognosi.
ino-acid transporter 1 and ASCT2 can serve as a significant prognostic factor for predicting worse outcome after surgical treatment and may have an important role in the development and aggressiveness of tongue cance.
fy druggable oncogenic fusions in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) of the lung, a malignant type of lung adenocarcinoma in which KRAS mutations frequently occu.
MA cohort of 90 cases, consisting of 56 cases (62%) with KRAS mutations and 34 cases without (38%), we conducted whole-transcriptome sequencing of 32 IMAs, including 27 cases without KRAS mutations. We used the sequencing data to identify gene fusions, and then performed functional analyses of the fusion gene product.
fied oncogenic fusions that occurred mutually exclusively with KRAS mutations: CD74-NRG1, SLC3A2-NRG1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF, and KIAA1468-RET. NRG1 fusions were present in 17.6% (6/34) of KRAS-negative IMAs. The CD74-NRG1 fusion activated HER2:HER3 signaling, whereas the EZR-ERBB4 and TRIM24-BRAF fusions constitutively activated the ERBB4 and BRAF kinases, respectively. Signaling pathway activation and fusion-induced anchorage-independent growth/tumorigenicity of NIH3T3 cells expressing these fusions were suppressed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors approved for clinical us.
 fusions act as driver mutations in IMAs without KRAS mutations, and thus represent promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of such IMA.
, there is no effective treatment for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which is the most prevalent in the northeastern part of Thailand. A new molecular target for the treatment of CCA is, therefore, urgently needed. Although L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is highly expressed in CCA cells, its role in malignant phenotypes of CCA cells remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of LAT1 on proliferation, migration, and invasion of KKU-M213 cells, the CCA cells derived from Thai patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Results showed that KKU-M213 cells expressed all LAT isoforms (LAT1, LAT2, LAT3 and LAT4). The expressions of LAT1 and its associated protein 4F2hc were highest whereas those of LAT2 and LAT4 were extremely low. Treatment with 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) reduced L-leucine uptake concomitant with an inhibition of cell motility and, to a lesser extent, on cell proliferation. It also induced a time dependent up-regulation of LAT1 and 4F2hc expressions. Similarly, cell migration and invasion, but not proliferation, were reduced in LAT1 knockdown KKU-M213 cells. In addition, silencing of LAT1 inhibited the expressions of 4F2hc mRNA and protein whereas the expression of microRNA-7, the 4F2hc down-regulator, was increased. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and p70S6K were reduced after LAT1 knockdown. Collectively, these results suggest that suppression of cell invasion and migration in LAT1 knockdown KKU-M213 cells may be partly mediated through the inhibition of the 4F2hc-signaling pathway by the up-regulation of microRNA-7. Based on this finding, LAT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating CC.
g amino acid availability (via infusion or ingestion) at rest or postexercise enhances amino acid transport into human skeletal muscle. It is unknown whether alterations in amino acid availability, from ingesting different dietary proteins, can enhance amino acid transport rates and amino acid transporter (AAT) mRNA expression. We hypothesized that the prolonged hyperaminoacidemia from ingesting a blend of proteins with different digestion rates postexercise would enhance amino acid transport into muscle and AAT expression compared with the ingestion of a rapidly digested protein. In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, we studied 16 young adults at rest and after acute resistance exercise coupled with postexercise (1 h) ingestion of either a (soy-dairy) protein blend or whey protein. Phenylalanine net balance and transport rate into skeletal muscle were measured using stable isotopic methods in combination with femoral arteriovenous blood sampling and muscle biopsies obtained at rest and 3 and 5 h postexercise. Phenylalanine transport into muscle and mRNA expression of select AATs [system L amino acid transporter 1/solute-linked carrier (SLC) 7A5, CD98/SLC3A2, system A amino acid transporter 2/SLC38A2, proton-assisted amino acid transporter 1/SLC36A1, cationic amino acid transporter 1/SLC7A1] increased to a similar extent in both groups (P &lt; 0.05). However, the ingestion of the protein blend resulted in a prolonged and positive net phenylalanine balance during postexercise recovery compared with whey protein (P &lt; 0.05). Postexercise myofibrillar protein synthesis increased similarly between groups. We conclude that, while both protein sources enhanced postexercise AAT expression, transport into muscle, and myofibrillar protein synthesis, postexercise ingestion of a protein blend results in a slightly prolonged net amino acid balance across the leg compared with whey protei.
m L1-type amino acid transporter mediates transport of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) in many mammalian cell-types. LNAA such as leucine are required for full activation of the mTOR-S6K signalling pathway promoting protein synthesis and cell growth. The SLC7A5 (LAT1) catalytic subunit of high-affinity System L1 functions as a glycoprotein-associated heterodimer with the multifunctional protein SLC3A2 (CD98). We generated a floxed Slc7a5 mouse strain which, when crossed with mice expressing Cre driven by a global promoter, produced Slc7a5 heterozygous knockout (Slc7a5+/-) animals with no overt phenotype, although homozygous global knockout of Slc7a5 was embryonically lethal. Muscle-specific (MCK Cre-mediated) Slc7a5 knockout (MS-Slc7a5-KO) mice were used to study the role of intracellular LNAA delivery by the SLC7A5 transporter for mTOR-S6K pathway activation in skeletal muscle. Activation of muscle mTOR-S6K (Thr389 phosphorylation) in vivo by intraperitoneal leucine injection was blunted in homozygous MS-Slc7a5-KO mice relative to wild-type animals. Dietary intake and growth rate were similar for MS-Slc7a5-KO mice and wild-type littermates fed for 10 weeks (to age 120 days) with diets containing 10%, 20% or 30% of protein. In MS-Slc7a5-KO mice, Leu and Ile concentrations in gastrocnemius muscle were reduced by ∼40% as dietary protein content was reduced from 30 to 10%. These changes were associated with &gt;50% decrease in S6K Thr389 phosphorylation in muscles from MS-Slc7a5-KO mice, indicating reduced mTOR-S6K pathway activation, despite no significant differences in lean tissue mass between groups on the same diet. MS-Slc7a5-KO mice on 30% protein diet exhibited mild insulin resistance (e.g. reduced glucose clearance, larger gonadal adipose depots) relative to control animals. Thus, SLC7A5 modulates LNAA-dependent muscle mTOR-S6K signalling in mice, although it appears non-essential (or is sufficiently compensated by e.g. SLC7A8 (LAT2)) for maintenance of normal muscle mas.
ic amino acid transporters (HATs) are the unique example, known in all kingdoms of life, of solute transporters composed of two subunits linked by a conserved disulfide bridge. In metazoans, the heavy subunit is responsible for the trafficking of the heterodimer to the plasma membrane, and the light subunit is the transporter. HATs are involved in human pathologies such as amino acidurias, tumor growth and invasion, viral infection and cocaine addiction. However structural information about interactions between the heavy and light subunits of HATs is scarce. In this work, transmission electron microscopy and single-particle analysis of purified human 4F2hc/L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2) heterodimers overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, together with docking analysis and crosslinking experiments, reveal that the extracellular domain of 4F2hc interacts with LAT2, almost completely covering the extracellular face of the transporter. 4F2hc increases the stability of the light subunit LAT2 in detergent-solubilized Pichia membranes, allowing functional reconstitution of the heterodimer into proteoliposomes. Moreover, the extracellular domain of 4F2hc suffices to stabilize solubilized LAT2. The interaction of 4F2hc with LAT2 gives insights into the structural bases for light subunit recognition and the stabilizing role of the ancillary protein in HAT.
ain (4F2 Ag, Slc3a2) was discovered as a lymphocyte-activation Ag. Deletion of CD98 H chain in B cells leads to complete failure of B cell proliferation, plasma cell formation, and Ab secretion. In this study, we examined the role of T cell CD98 in cell-mediated immunity and autoimmune disease pathogenesis by specifically deleting it in murine T cells. Deletion of T cell CD98 prevented experimental autoimmune diabetes associated with dramatically reduced T cell clonal expansion. Nevertheless, initial T cell homing to pancreatic islets was unimpaired. In sharp contrast to B cells, CD98-null T cells showed only modestly impaired Ag-driven proliferation and nearly normal homeostatic proliferation. Furthermore, these cells were activated by Ag, leading to cytokine production (CD4) and efficient cytolytic killing of targets (CD8). The integrin-binding domain of CD98 was necessary and sufficient for full clonal expansion, pointing to a role for adhesive signaling in T cell proliferation and autoimmune disease. When we expanded CD98-null T cells in vitro, they adoptively transferred diabetes, establishing that impaired clonal expansion was responsible for protection from disease. Thus, the integrin-binding domain of CD98 is required for Ag-driven T cell clonal expansion in the pathogenesis of an autoimmune disease and may represent a useful therapeutic targe.
ransporter 1 (GLUT1) is widely distributed throughout various tissues and contributes to insulin-independent basal glucose uptake. Using a split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid system, we newly identified 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) as a membrane protein interacting with GLUT1. Though 4F2hc reportedly forms heterodimeric complexes between amino acid transporters, such as LAT1 and LAT2, and regulates amino acid uptake, we investigated the effects of 4F2hc on GLUT1 expression and the associated glucose uptake. First, FLAG-tagged 4F2hc and hemagglutinin-tagged GLUT1 were overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and their association was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. The green fluorescent protein-tagged 4F2hc and DsRed-tagged GLUT1 showed significant, but incomplete, colocalization at the plasma membrane. In addition, an endogenous association between GLUT1 and 4F2hc was demonstrated using mouse brain tissue and HeLa cells. Interestingly, overexpression of 4F2hc increased the amount of GLUT1 protein in HeLa and HepG2 cells with increased glucose uptake. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated 4F2hc gene suppression markedly reduced GLUT1 protein in both cell types, with reduced glucose uptake. While GLUT1 mRNA levels were not affected by overexpression or gene silencing of 4F2hc, GLUT1 degradation after the addition of cycloheximide was significantly suppressed by 4F2hc overexpression and increased by 4F2hc siRNA treatment. Taken together, these observations indicate that 4F2hc is likely to be involved in GLUT1 stabilization and to contribute to the regulation of not only amino acid but also glucose metabolis.
ino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is a neutral amino acid transport system and is a major route for the transport of large neutral amino acids, including methionine, through the plasma membrane. LAT1 requires the heavy chain of 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc) for its functional expression. Positron emission tomography (PET) with L-[methyl-(11)C] methionine (MET) provides information about amino acid metabolism in brain tumors. We conducted a clinicopathologic study to elucidate the correlation of LAT1 and 4F2hc expression with MET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed human gliomas. Thirty-three newly diagnosed glioma patients were enrolled in this study. Uptake of MET in the tumor was evaluated with the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Expression of the LAT1, 4F2hc, and CD34, and Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and the correlation with the SUVmax in the tumors was examined. Expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc was higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. The grade of LAT1 immunostaining increased with glioma grade. LAT1 was mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm and vascular endothelium and 4F2hc was mainly expressed in the tumor cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Expression of LAT1 but not 4F2hc was significantly correlated with MET SUVmax. Expression of LAT1 in the tumor vascular endothelium is significantly correlated with CD34 positive microvessel density. In conclusion, MET SUVmax correlates with LAT1 expression in the tumor in newly diagnosed gliomas. MET transport may be increased by an increased number of microvessels combined with a higher density or activity of LAT1 in the tumor endothelial cells in high-grade gliomas. Use of MET-PET as a molecular target combined with anti-angiogenesis in glioma therapy should be addressed in future studie.
e transport is mediated by the cationic/neutral amino acid transport system y+L and cationic amino acid transporters y+/CATs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). System y+/CATs activity may be rate-limiting for nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, but no reports have demonstrated system y+L involvement in NO synthesis in endothelium. We investigated the role of system y+L in NO synthesis in HUVECs. Transport of 1.5 microM L-arginine was inhibited (P &lt; 0.05) by L-lysine (K(i), 1.4 micro M), L-leucine (K(i), 1.8 micro M) and L-phenylalanine (K(i), 4.1 microM), but was unaltered (P &gt; 0.05) by L-alanine or L-cysteine. The system y+/CATs inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), did not alter 1.5 microM L-arginine transport, but inhibited (92 +/- 3 %) 100 microM L-arginine transport. L-arginine transport in the presence of NEM was saturable (V(max), 0.37 +/- 0.02 pmol (microg protein)(-1) min(-1); K(m), 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM) and competitively inhibited by L-leucine in the presence of Na+ (V(max), 0.49 +/- 0.06 pmol (microg protein)(-1) min(-1); K(m), 6.5 +/- 0.9 microM). HUVECs express SLC3A2/4F2hc, SLC7A7/4F2-lc2 and SLC7A6/4F2-lc3 genes encoding for the high-affinity transport system y+L. N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and L-leucine, but not NEM, inhibited NO synthesis in medium containing 1.5 microM L-arginine. Cells exposed to 25 mM D-glucose (24 h) exhibited reduced system y+L activity (V(max), 0.15 +/- 0.008 pmol (microg protein)(-1) min(-1); K(m), 1.4 +/- 0.3 microM) and NO synthesis. However, 25 mM D-glucose increased NO synthesis and L-arginine transport via system y+. Thus, L-arginine transport through system y+L plays a role in NO synthesis, which could be a determining factor in pathological conditions where the endothelial L-arginine-NO pathway is altered, such as in diabetes mellitu.
cell activation is controlled by signaling through the T cell receptor in addition to various co-receptors, and is also affected by their interactions with effector and regulatory T cells in the microenvironment. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are caused by the persistent activation and expansion of auto-aggressive CD4(+) T cells that attack intestinal epithelial cells. However, the molecular basis for the persistent activation of CD4(+) T cells in IBD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how the CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc, Slc3a2) affected the development of colitis in an experimental animal model. Transferring CD98hc-deficient CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells into Rag2(-/-) mice did not cause colitis accompanied by increasing Foxp3(+) inducible regulatory T cells. By comparison, CD98hc-deficient naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nTregs) had a decreased capability to suppress colitis induced by CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, although CD98hc-deficient mice did not have a defect in the development of nTregs. Blocking CD98hc with an anti-CD98 blocking antibody prevented the development of colitis. Our results indicate that CD98hc regulates the expansion of autoimmune CD4(+) T cells in addition to controlling nTregs functions, which suggests the CD98hc as an important target molecule for establishing strategies for treating coliti.
ne transport activity of a lens epithelial cell line originated from a canine mature cataract was investigated. The distinct cystine transport activity was observed, which was inhibited to 28% by extracellular 1 mM glutamate. The cDNA sequences of canine cysteine/glutamate exchanger (xCT) and 4F2hc were determined. The predicted amino acid sequences were 527 and 533 amino acid polypeptides, respectively. The amino acid sequences of canine xCT and 4F2hc showed high similarities (&gt;80%) to those of humans. The expression of xCT in lens epithelial cell line was confirmed by western blot analysis. RT-PCR analysis revealed high level expression only in the brain, and it was below the detectable level in other tissue.
ssion of CD98hc (SLC3A2) occurs in a variety of cancers and is suspected to contribute to tumor growth. CD98, a heterodimeric transmembrane protein, physically associates with certain integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains via its heavy chain, CD98hc. CD98hc regulates adhesion-induced intracellular signal transduction via integrins, thereby, affecting cell proliferation and clonal expansion. Disruption of CD98hc led to embryonic lethality in mice (E 3.5 and E 9.5) and CD98hc -/- embryonic stem cell transplantation failed to form teratomas, while CD98hc over-expression in somatic cells resulted in anchorage-independent growth. However, it is unclear whether interference with CD98hc expression tumor cell behavio.
l cancer cell lines have been used to determine the effect of CD98hc expression on cancer cell behavior using cell adhesion, cell trans-migration and cell spreading assays. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to study the rate of apoptosis after detachment or serum starvation. shRNA-lentiviral constructs were used to stably knockdown or reconstitute full length or mutated CD98hc. The role of CD98 as a promotor of tumorigenesis was evaluated using an in in vivo tumor transplantation animal model. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to analyze cell proliferation and CD98 expression in tumor.
rt shows that CD98hc silencing in clear cell renal cancer cells reverts certain characteristics of tumorigenesis, including cell spreading, migration, proliferation and survival in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Acquisition of tumorigenic characteristics in clear cell renal cancer cells occurred through the integrin binding domain of CD98hc. A CD98hc/integrin interaction was required for adhesion-induced sustained FAK phosphorylation and activation of the major downstream signaling pathways PI3k/Akt and MEK/ERK, while overexpression of a constitutive active form of FAK rescued the CD98hc deficienc.
tudy we demonstrate that loss of CD98hc blocks tumorigenic potential in renal cell cance.
 protein intolerance (LPI) is an inherited aminoaciduria caused by recessive mutations in the SLC7A7 gene encoding y+L amino acid transporter 1 (y+LAT1), which combines with 4F2hc to generate an active transporter responsible for the system y+L amino acid transport. We have previously shown that the y+LAT1 proteins with point mutations are expressed in the plasma membrane, while those with frameshift mutations are retained in the cytoplasm. This finding has prompted us to study whether the difference in localization is due to the inability of the structurally altered mutant y+LAT1 proteins to heteromerize with 4F2hc. For this purpose, we utilized FACS technique to reveal fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in cells expressing wild type or LPI-mutant CFP-tagged y+LAT1 and YFP-tagged 4F2hc. The heteromerization of y+LAT1 and 4F2hc within the cell is not disrupted by any of the tested LPI mutations. In addition, the expression rate of the LPI mutant y+LAT1 proteins was significantly lower and cellular mortality was markedly increased than that of the wild type y+LAT1 in transfected samples. Our results indicate that the FACS-FRET method provides an alternative approach for screening of potential protein association.
a type-II glycoprotein whose covalent-bound association with one of several described light chains yields a heterodimer mainly involved in large neutral amino acid transport. Likewise, it is well known that the heavy chain interacts with β-integrins mediating integrin-dependent events such as survival, proliferation, migration and even transformation. 4F2hc is a ubiquitous protein whose overexpression has been related to tumor development and progression. Stable silencing of 4F2hc in HeLa cells using an artificial miRNA impairs in vivo tumorigenicity and leads to an ineffective proliferation response to mitogens. 4F2hc colocalizes with β1-integrins and CD147, but this interaction does not occur in lipid rafts in HeLa cells. Moreover, silenced cells present defects in integrin- (FAK, Akt and ERK1/2) and hypoxia-dependent signaling, and reduced expression/activity of MMP-2. These alterations seem to be dependent on the inappropriate formation of CD147/4F2hc/β1-integrin heterocomplexes on the cell surface, arising when CD147 cannot interact with 4F2hc. Although extracellular galectin-3 accumulates due to the decrease in MMP-2 activity, galectin-3 signaling events are blocked due to an impaired interaction with 4F2hc, inducing an increased degradation of β-catenin. Furthermore, cell motility is compromised after protein silencing, suggesting that 4F2hc is related to tumor invasion by facilitating cell motility. Therefore, here we propose a molecular mechanism by which 4F2hc participates in tumor progression, favoring first steps of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by inhibition of β-catenin proteasomal degradation through Akt/GSK-3β signaling and enabling cell motilit.
g is linked to reduced epidermal proliferation and general extracellular matrix atrophy. This involves factors such as the cell adhesion receptors integrins and amino acid transporters. CD98hc (SLC3A2), a heterodimeric amino acid transporter, modulates integrin signaling in vitro. We unravel CD98hc functions in vivo in skin. We report that CD98hc invalidation has no appreciable effect on cell adhesion, clearly showing that CD98hc disruption phenocopies neither CD98hc knockdown in cultured keratinocytes nor epidermal β1 integrin loss in vivo. Instead, we show that CD98hc deletion in murine epidermis results in improper skin homeostasis and epidermal wound healing. These defects resemble aged skin alterations and correlate with reduction of CD98hc expression observed in elderly mice. We also demonstrate that CD98hc absence in vivo induces defects as early as integrin-dependent Src activation. We decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in vivo by revealing a crucial role of the CD98hc/integrins/Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG)/RhoA pathway in skin homeostasis. Finally, we demonstrate that the deregulation of RhoA activation in the absence of CD98hc is also a result of impaired CD98hc-dependent amino acid transport.
 a type II transmembrane protein that covalently links to one of several L-type amino acid transporters. CD98hc was first identified as a lymphocyte activation marker. In this study, we examined the role that CD98hc plays in the functions of macrophages using tissue specific knock-out miceCD98hc (CD98hc(flox/-)LysM-cre mice). When isolated peritoneal macrophages were incubated for 48 h, the macrophages obtained from the knock-out mice showed round-shaped morphologies, while almost all of the cells obtained from the control mice were spindle-shaped. The macrophage functions such as the antigen-presenting, phagocytic, and fusion activities, have been reported to decrease in CD98hc-deficient peritoneal macrophages. In addition, when the CD98hc deficient macrophages were stimulated with either IFN-γ/LPS or IL-4, the production of NO(2) or arginase-I decreased in comparison to that observed in the control macrophages. These findings show that the CD98hc molecules play an important role in the activation and functions of macrophage.
 known about the CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) in the T lymphocyte-mediated immune response to alloantige.
n in vitro mixed leukocyte reaction assay and a cardiac transplantation model to evaluate the mechanisms of CD98hc in regulating alloimmune response.
specific deficiency of CD98hc resulted in lower responses to alloantigen stimulation in a mixed leukocyte reaction assay, and CD98hc-deficient mice accepted full major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cardiac allografts. Consistent with graft survival, the infiltration of the graft by immune cells in CD98hc-deficient mice was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice. A chemotaxis assay revealed the migration of CD98hc-deficient lymphocytes to decrease in the presence of CCL5 compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, the proportion of CD4/Foxp3-positive cells and Foxp3 messenger RNA increased significantly in CD98hc-deficient recipients, consistent with the down-regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin and PS6 kinase; and allograft permanent acceptance was shortened by the depletion of antibody-induced regulatory T cells. Finally, neutralizing antibody against CD98hc prolonged the cardiac allograft surviva.
ether, our data indicate that T cell-specific deficiency in CD98hc can contribute to cardiac allograft permanent acceptance correlating with the attenuation of lymphocyte migration and by increasing the generation of regulatory T cells. These findings are expected to make it possible to develop novel approaches for treating allograft rejection and promoting transplantation toleranc.
play of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells targeting autoantigens is responsible for the progression of a number of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell activation is crucial for designing effective therapies for autoimmune diseases. We probed a panel of Abs with T cell-modulating activity and identified a mAb specific for the H chain of CD98 (CD98hc) that was able to suppress T cell proliferation. The anti-CD98hc mAb also inhibited Ag-specific proliferation and the acquisition of effector function by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. Injection of the anti-CD98hc mAb completely prevented the onset of cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes in NOD mice. Treatment of diabetic NOD mice with anti-CD98hc reversed the diabetic state to normal levels, coincident with decreased proliferation of CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, treatment of diabetic NOD mice with CD98hc small interfering RNA resolved T1D. These data indicate that strategies targeting CD98hc might have clinical application for treating T1D and other T cell-mediated autoimmune disease.
functional protein CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc, Slc3a2) associates with integrin β1 through its cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and the CD98hc-mediated integrin signaling is required for maintenance of ES cell proliferation. CD98hc-null mice exhibit early post-implantation lethality similar to integrin β1-null mice, supporting the importance of its interaction with integrin β1. On the other hand, the extracellular domain of CD98hc interacts with L-type amino acid transporters (LATs) and is essential for appropriate cell surface distribution of LATs. LATs mediate the transport of amino acids and other molecules such as thyroid hormone. In this respect, CD98hc may also affect development via these transporter.
tudy, mice were generated from embryonic stem (ES) cell line (PST080) harboring a mutant CD98hc allele (CD98hcΔ/+). Expression of the CD98hc mutant allele results in ΔCD98hc-β geo fusion protein where extracellular C-terminal 102 amino acids of CD98hc are replaced with β geo. Analyses of PST080 ES cells as well as reconstituted frog oocytes demonstrated that ΔCD98hc-β geo fusion protein preserved its ability to interact with integrin β1 although this mutant protein was hardly localized on the cell surface. These findings suggest that ΔCD98hc-β geo protein can mediate integrin signaling but cannot support amino acid transport through LATs. CD98hcΔ/+ mice were normal. Although some of the implantation sites lacked embryonic component at E9.5, all the implantation sites contained embryonic component at E7.5. Thus, CD98hcΔ/Δ embryos are likely to die between E7.5 and E9..
ng that CD98hc complete knockout (CD98hc-/-) embryos are reported to die shortly after implantation, our findings suggest potential stage-specific roles of CD98hc in murine embryonic development. CD98hc may be essential for early post-implantation development by regulating integrin-dependent signaling, while the other function of CD98hc as a component of amino acid transporters may be required for embryonic development at later stage.
98hc) is a multifunctional type II membrane glycoprotein involved in several functions as amino acid transport, cell fusion, β1-integrin-signaling and transformation. 4F2hc ectodomain has been crystallized and its three-dimensional structure determined. We have carried out a spectroscopical/structural characterization of the recombinant ectodomain in order to obtain information on its dynamic structure in solution and on its ability to form homodimers by itself in the absence of the transmembrane helix and of the potential interactions with the plasma membrane. Analytical ultracentrifugation and crosslinking experiments showed that the ectodomain is monomeric in solution. The secondary structure determined by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (around 30% α-helix and 20% β-sheets, 12% antiparallel and 8% parallel) reveals a compact and thermally stable structure with a high melting temperature (57-59°C). Tryptophan residues are mainly buried and immobilized in the hydrophobic core of the protein as suggested by near-UV CD spectrum, the position of the Trp maximum fluorescence emission (323nm) and from the acrylamide quenching constant (2.6M(-1)). Urea unfolding equilibrium has been studied by far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy to gain information on the folding/unfolding process of the ectodomain. The analyses suggest the existence of two intermediate states as reported for other TIM barrel-containing proteins rather than an independent unfolding of each domain [A, (βα)(8) barrel; C, antiparallel β(8) sandwich]. Folding seems to be directed by the initial formation of hydrophobic clusters within the first strands of the β-barrel of domain A followed by additional hydrophobic interactions in domain .
of keratinocytes is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the skin, as demonstrated by the number of dermatological disorders of genetic origin that are associated with a defect of basal keratinocyte adhesion. Integrins are the main component of the molecular networks involved in this phenomenon, but there are many others. In a recent description of proteins associated to caveolae at the plasma membrane of human basal epidermal cells, we demonstrated that CD98hc is localized with β1 integri.
igated the CD98hc proteins interactions and the role of CD98hc in keratinocyte adhesio.
otein interaction was identified following co-immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis using LTQ-FT mass spectrometer. Extinction of CD98hc gene expression using specific short hairpin RNA or over-expression of CD98hc lacking the β1 integrin binding site was used to evaluate the role of this protein in keratinocyte fat.
hat CD98hc forms molecular complexes with β1 and β4 integrins in primary human keratinocytes and, using immunofluorescence, that these complexes are localized at the plasma membrane, in keeping with a role in adhesion. We confirmed that this protein is a key player of keratinocyte adhesion because in absence of interaction between CD98hc and integrins, β1 integrin failed to translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and keratinocytes expressed epidermal differentiation marker.
 data strongly suggested that CD98hc is involved in integrin trafficking and by consequence, in keratinocyte adhesion and differentiatio.
n of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to migrate and proliferate is essential for the formation of intimal hyperplasia. Hence, selectively targeting activated VSMCs is a potential strategy against vaso-occlusive disorders such as in-stent restenosis, vein-graft stenosis, and transplant vasculopathy. We show that CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) is markedly up-regulated in neointimal and cultured VSMCs, and that activated but not quiescent VSMCs require CD98hc for survival. CD98hc mediates integrin signaling and localizes amino acid transporters to the plasma membrane. SMC-specific deletion of CD98hc did not affect normal vessel morphology, indicating that CD98hc was not required for the maintenance of resident quiescent VSMCs; however, CD98hc deletion reduced intimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. Ex vivo and in vitro, loss of CD98hc suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in VSMCs. Furthermore, reconstitution with CD98hc mutants showed that CD98hc interaction with integrins was necessary for the survival of VSMCs. These studies establish the importance of CD98hc in VSMC proliferation and survival. Furthermore, loss of CD98hc was selectively deleterious to activated VSMCs while sparing resident quiescent VSMCs, suggesting that activated VSMCs are physiologically dependent on CD98hc, and hence, CD98hc is a potential therapeutic target in vaso-occlusive disorder.
ety of malignant diseases, molecular targeting represents a therapeutic option, whereby, when compared with chemotherapy, fewer side effects are thought to be expected. Especially in renal cell cancer (RCC), tyrosine kinase-inhibitors have been established as useful and highly effective therapy. However, tyrosine kinase-inhibitors currently approved for RCC treatment lack single molecule specificity and bear a variety of side effects of the gastro-intestinal tract, skin, heart and haematopoietic system. Therefore, the identification of novel cell surface markers is sought, which might lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cance.
embedded RCCs from a well characterized tissue bank were immunohistochemically quantified for embryonic transmembrane antigen CD98hc (SLC3A2) expression and semi-quantitative analyses were correlated with subtype or grade of differentiatio.
increased CD98hc expression in different types of malign RCCs, among them clear cell (cc)RCC, papillary (p)RCC and chromophobe (ch)RCC, but lack of expression in the benign renal oncocytoma. Thereby, the extent of CD98hc expression directly complies with grade of malignancy. Furthermore, the more malignant type II pRCC significantly higher expressed CD98hc than the less malignant and more differentiated type I pRCC (type II 83.34%, type I 4.76% CD98hc positive, P &lt; 0.00001; n = 51). The established marker for type I pRCC, Cytokreatin 7, showed 95.24% expression in type I and 26.67% expression in type II pRCC (P &lt; 0.00001, n = 51.
e data, we conclude that CD98hc is expressed in RCCs, whereby the extent of expression is likely to correlate directly with grade of malignancy. In pRCCs, CD98hc might represent a novel and reliable marker for type II pRC.
dependent assembly of the fibronectin (Fn) matrix plays a central role in vertebrate development. We identify CD98hc, a membrane protein, as an important component of the matrix assembly machinery both in vitro and in vivo. CD98hc was not required for biosynthesis of cellular Fn or the maintenance of the repertoire or affinity of cellular Fn binding integrins, which are important contributors to Fn assembly. Instead, CD98hc was involved in the cell's ability to exert force on the matrix and did so by dint of its capacity to interact with integrins to support downstream signals that lead to activation of RhoA small GTPase. Thus, we identify CD98hc as a membrane protein that enables matrix assembly and establish that it functions by interacting with integrins to support RhoA-driven contractility. CD98hc expression can vary widely; our data show that these variations in CD98hc expression can control the capacity of cells to assemble an Fn matrix, a process important in development, wound healing, and tumorigenesi.
s, beta1 integrin adhesion receptors generate signals that mediate cell spreading, migration, proliferation, and survival. CD98, a heterodimeric transmembrane protein, physically associates with certain integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic domains (tails) via its heavy chain, CD98hc (SLC3A2), and loss of CD98hc impairs integrin signaling. Here we have used the lack of CD98hc interaction with the Drosophila integrin betaPS tail for a homology scanning analysis that implicated the C-terminal 8 residues of beta3 (Thr(755)-Thr(802)) in CD98hc binding. We then identified point mutations in the beta3 C terminus (T755K and T758M) that abolish CD98hc association and a double mutation in the corresponding residues in the betaPS tail (K839T,M842T), which resulted in gain of CD98hc interaction. Furthermore, the loss of function beta3(T755K) mutation or the gain of function beta3/betaPS(K839T,M842T) led to a loss or gain of integrin-mediated cell spreading, respectively. Thus, we have identified critical integrin residues required for CD98hc interaction and in doing so have shown that CD98c interaction with the integrin beta tail is required for its ability to mediate integrin signaling. These studies also provide new insights into how CD98hc may cooperate with other cytoplasmic domain binding proteins to modulate integrin functions and into the evolution of integrin signalin.
 regulate cellular behaviors through signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and kinases. CD98 heterodimers, comprised of a heavy chain (CD98hc, SLC3A2) and one of several light chains, interact with integrins through CD98hc. CD98hc overexpression leads to anchorage-independent cell growth and tumorigenesis in 3T3 fibroblasts and activates certain integrin-regulated signaling pathways. To establish the biological function of CD98hc, we disrupted the gene and analyzed CD98hc-null cells. Here we report that CD98hc contributes to integrin-dependent cell spreading, cell migration, and protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, CD98hc is required for efficient adhesion-induced activation of Akt and Rac GTPase, major contributors to the integrin-dependent signals involved in cell survival and cell migration. CD98 promotes amino acid transport through its light chains; however, a CD98hc mutant that interacts with beta1 integrins, but not CD98 light chains, restored integrin-dependent signaling and protection from apoptosis. beta1 integrins are involved in the pathogenesis of certain cancers. CD98hc deletion markedly impaired the ability of embryonic stem cells to form teratocarcinomas in mice; teratocarcinoma formation was reconstituted by reexpression of CD98hc or of the mutant that interacts exclusively with integrins. Thus, CD98hc is an integrin-associated protein that mediates integrin-dependent signals, which promote tumorigenesi.
LC3A2) constitutively and specifically associates with beta(1) integrins and is highly expressed on the surface of human tumor cells irrespective of the tissue of origin. We have found here that expression of CD98hc promotes both anchorage- and serum-independent growth. This oncogenic activity is dependent on beta(1) integrin-mediated phosphoinositol 3-hydroxykinase stimulation and the level of surface expression of CD98hc. Using chimeras of CD98hc and the type II membrane protein CD69, we show that the transmembrane domain of CD98hc is necessary and sufficient for integrin association in cells. Furthermore, CD98hc/beta(1) integrin association is required for focal adhesion kinase-dependent phosphoinositol 3-hydroxykinase activation and cellular transformation. Amino acids 82-87 in the putative cytoplasmic/transmembrane region appear to be critical for the oncogenic potential of CD98hc and provide a novel mechanism for tumor promotion by integrins. These results explain how high expression of CD98hc in human cancers contributes to transformation; furthermore, the transmembrane association of CD98hc and beta(1) integrins may provide a new target for cancer therap.
rter TAT1 (Slc16a10) mediates the facilitated diffusion of aromatic amino acids (AAAs) across basolateral membranes of kidney, small intestine and liver epithelial cells, and across the plasma membrane of non-epithelial cells like skeletal myocytes. Its role for body AA homeostasis has now been investigated using newly generated TAT1 (Slc16a10) defective mice (tat1(-/-)). These mice grow and reproduce normally, show no gross phenotype and no obvious neurological defect. Histological analysis did not reveal abnormalities and there is no compensatory change in any tested AA transporter mRNA. TAT1 null mice, however, display increased plasma, muscle and kidney AAA concentration under both normal and high protein diet, although this concentration remains normal in the liver. A major aromatic aminoaciduria and a smaller urinary loss of all substrates additionally transported by l-type AA antiporter Lat2-4F2hc (Slc7a8) were revealed under a high protein diet. This suggests an epithelial transport defect as also shown by the accumulation of intravenously injected (123)I-2-I-l-Phe in kidney and l-[(3)H]Phe in ex vivo everted gut sac enterocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that the uniporter TAT1 is required to equilibrate the concentration of AAAs across specific membranes. For instance, it enables hepatocytes to function as a sink that controls the extracellular AAAs concentration. Additionally, it facilitates the release of AAAs across the basolateral membrane of small intestine and proximal kidney tubule epithelial cells, thereby allowing the efflux of other neutral AAs presumably via Lat2-4F2h.
is a major transport system for cellular uptake of neutral amino acids. Among system L transporters, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is responsible for the nutrient uptake in cancer cells, whereas L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2) is a transporter for non-cancer cells. In this study, we have established HEK293 cell lines stably expressing high levels of human LAT1 and LAT2 forming heterodimers with native human 4F2hc of the cells. We have found that L-[(14)C]alanine is an appropriate substrate to examine the function of LAT2, whereas L-[(14)C]leucine is used for LAT1. By using L-[(14)C]alanine on LAT2, we have for the first time directly evaluated the function of human LAT2 expressed in mammalian cells and obtained its reliable kinetics. Using α-alkyl amino acids including α-methyl-alanine and α-ethyl-L-alanine, we have demonstrated that α-alkyl groups interfere with the interaction with LAT2. These cell lines with higher practical advantages would be useful for screening and analyzing compounds to develop LAT1-specific drugs that can be used for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The strategy that we took to establish the cell lines would also be applicable to the other heterodimeric transporters with important therapeutic implication.
98) has been associated with tumor growth, and is highly expressed in various tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of 4F2hc expression in pulmonary neuroendocrine (NE) tumors. Surgically-resected patient tumors including 16 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), 12 small cell lung cancer (SCLC), 1 atypical carcinoid (AC) and 5 typical carcinoid (TC) samples were included in this study. Tumor sections were immunohistochemically stained for 4F2hc (CD98), glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) and 3 (Glut3), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), hexokinase I, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), microvessel density (CD34), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway (p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-S6K) and for a cell cycle regulator (p53). 4F2hc was overexpressed in 0% of the pulmonary carcinoids (TCs and ACs), 62.5% of the LCNECs and 50.0% of the SCLCs. A positive 4F2hc expression was significantly associated with age, histology and Glut1 expression. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between 4F2hc expression, and Glut1, HIF-1α, p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-S6K. The expression of 4F2hc was also significantly associated with poor overall survival. The expression of 4F2hc expression tended to increase from low-grade to high-grade pulmonary NE tumors. Our results suggest that 4F2hc may play a significant role in tumor progression, hypoxic conditions and poor outcome in patients with pulmonary NE tumor.
tem L amino acid transporter 2) is composed of the subunits Slc7a8/Lat2 and Slc3a2/4F2hc. This transporter is highly expressed along the basolateral membranes of absorptive epithelia in kidney and small intestine, but is also abundant in the brain. Lat2 is an energy-independent exchanger of neutral amino acids, and was shown to transport thyroid hormones. We report in the present paper that targeted inactivation of Slc7a8 leads to increased urinary loss of small neutral amino acids. Development and growth of Slc7a8(-/-) mice appears normal, suggesting functional compensation of neutral amino acid transport by alternative transporters in kidney, intestine and placenta. Movement co-ordination is slightly impaired in mutant mice, although cerebellar development and structure remained inconspicuous. Circulating thyroid hormones, thyrotropin and thyroid hormone-responsive genes remained unchanged in Slc7a8(-/-) mice, possibly because of functional compensation by the thyroid hormone transporter Mct8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8), which is co-expressed in many cell types. The reason for the mild neurological phenotype remains unresolve.
inine metabolites, such as nitric oxide and polyamines, influence the expression of genes involved in erythroid differentiation, the transport of the cationic amino acid may play an important role in erythroid cells. However, available data only concern the presence in these cells of CAT1 transporter (system y(+)), while no information exists on the role of the heterodimeric transporters of system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT1 and 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2) which operates transmembrane arginine fluxes cis-inhibited by neutral amino acids in the presence of sodium. Using erythroleukemia K562 cells and normal erythroid precursors, we demonstrate here that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to the additive contributions of a leucine-sensitive and leucine-insensitive component. In both cell types, leucine inhibition of arginine influx is much less evident in the absence of sodium, a hallmark of system y(+)L. In K562 cells, N-ethylmaleimide, a known inhibitor of CAT transporters (system y(+)), suppresses only a fraction of arginine influx corresponding to leucine-insensitive uptake. Moreover, in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing 4F2hc and y(+)LAT2, leucine exerts a marked inhibition of arginine transport, partially dependent on sodium, while no inhibition is seen in oocytes expressing CAT1. Lastly, silencing of SLC7A6, the gene for y(+)LAT2, lowers arginine transport and doubles the intracellular content of the cationic amino acid in K562 cells. We conclude that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to both system y(+) (CAT1 transporter) and system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 isoform), which mainly contribute, respectively, to the influx and to the efflux of the cationic amino aci.
 is widely used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Pharmacokinetics of this alkylating drug shows high inter-individual variability. As melphalan is a phenylalanine derivative, the pharmacokinetic variability may be determined by genetic polymorphisms in the L-type amino acid transporters LAT1 (SLC7A5) and LAT2 (SLC7A8.
inetics were analysed in 64 patients after first administration of intravenous melphalan. Severity of side effects was documented according to WHO criteria. Genomic DNA was analysed for polymorphisms in LAT1 and LAT2 by sequencing of the entire coding region, intron-exon boundaries and 2 kb upstream promoter region. Selected polymorphisms in the common heavy chain of both transporters, the protein 4F2hc (SLC3A2), were analysed by single nucleotide primer extensio.
 pharmacokinetics was highly variable with up to 6.2-fold differences in total clearance. A total of 44 polymorphisms were identified in LAT1 and 21 polymorphisms in LAT2. From all variants, only five were in the coding region and only one heterozygous non-synonymous polymorphism (Ala94Thr) was found in LAT2. Numerous polymorphisms were found in the LAT1 and LAT2 5'-flanking regions but did not correlate with expression of the respective genes. No significant correlations could be observed between the polymorphisms in 4F2hc, LAT1, and LAT2 with melphalan pharmacokinetics or with melphalan side effect.
 confirmed that these transporter genes are highly conserved, particularly in the coding sequences. Genetic variation in 4F2hc, LAT1, and LAT2 does not appear to be a major cause of inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and of adverse reactions to melphala.
of amino acid efflux from individual cells needs to be adapted to cellular demands and plays a central role for the control of extracellular amino acid homeostasis. A particular example of such an outward amino acid transport is the basolateral efflux from transporting epithelial cells located in the small intestine and kidney proximal tubule. Because LAT2-4F2hc (Slc7a8-Slc3a2), the best known basolateral neutral amino acid transporter of these epithelial cells, functions as an obligatory exchanger, we tested whether TAT1 (Slc16a10), the aromatic amino-acid facilitated diffusion transporter, might allow amino acid efflux via this exchanger by recycling its influx substrates. In this study, we show by immunofluorescence that TAT1 and LAT2 indeed colocalize in the early kidney proximal tubule. Using the Xenopus laevis oocytes expression system, we show that L-glutamine is released from oocytes into an amino-acid-free medium only when both transporters are coexpressed. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis reveals that several other neutral amino acids are released as well. The transport function of both TAT1 and LAT2-4F2hc is necessary for this efflux, as coexpression of functionally inactive but surface-expressed mutants is ineffective. Based on negative results of coimmunoprecipitation and crosslinking experiments, the physical interaction of these transporters does not appear to be required. Furthermore, replacement of TAT1 or LAT2-4F2hc by the facilitated diffusion transporter LAT4 or the obligatory exchanger LAT1, respectively, supports similar functional cooperation. Taken together, the results suggest that the aromatic amino acid diffusion pathway TAT1 can control neutral amino acid efflux via neighboring exchanger LAT2-4F2hc, by recycling its aromatic influx substrate.
xCT), together with SLC3A2 (4F2hc), encodes the heterodimeric amino acid transport system x(c)-, which mediates cystine-glutamate exchange and thereby regulates intracellular glutathione levels. We used microarrays to analyze gene expression of transporters in 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening (NCI-60). The expression of SLC7A11 showed significant correlation with that of SLC3A2 (r = 0.66), which in turn correlated with SLC7A5 (r = 0.68), another known partner for SLC3A2, and with T1A-2 (r = 0.60; all P &lt; 0.0001). Linking expression of SLC7A11 with potency of 1,400 candidate anticancer drugs identified 39 showing positive correlations, e.g., amino acid analogue, L-alanosine, and 296 with negative correlations, e.g., geldanamycin. However, no significant correlation was observed with the geldanamycin analogue 17-allylamino, 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). Inhibition of transport system x(c)- with glutamate or (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine in lung A549 and HOP-62, and ovarian SK-OV-3 cells, reduced the potency of L-alanosine and lowered intracellular glutathione levels. This further resulted in increased potency of geldanamycin, with no effect on 17-AAG. Down-regulation of SLC7A11 by small interfering RNA affected drug potencies similarly to transport inhibitors. The inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, buthionine sulfoximine, also decreased intracellular glutathione levels and enhanced potency of geldanamycin, but did not affect L-alanosine. These results indicate that SLC7A11 mediates cellular uptake of L-alanosine but confers resistance to geldanamycin by supplying cystine for glutathione maintenance. SLC7A11 expression could serve as a predictor of cellular response to L-alanosine and glutathione-mediated resistance to geldanamycin, yielding a potential target for increasing chemosensitivity to multiple drug.
ion affects one-fifth of the world population. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correlated with hyper-tension in large samples. However, the genetic mutations leading to hypertension might differ among various populations, as they have dif-ferent origins and are subjected to different environmental pressures. Therefore, additional studies are urgently needed to verify the GWAS findings across different populations. This study focused on the natri-uretic peptide receptor C gene (NPR3), one of the hypertension-positive genes identified in a GWAS of an East Asian population. The correla-tion analysis between NPR3 and hypertension was replicated in 450 Chinese Dai (235 patients vs 215 controls) and 484 Chinese Mongolian (211 patients vs 273 controls) individuals. The positive SNP identified by GWAS analysis and three other tag SNPs representing the NPR3 linkage disequilibrium (LD) block regions were selected for genotyp-ing. The results revealed that the rs1173766 polymorphism was associ-ated with the occurrence of hypertension (χ(2) = 6.87, P = 0.0088), and that the T allele should be protective in the Dai ethnic group. Consider-ing a close LD block at the 3' end of the NPR3 gene in the East Asian population, we speculate that there might be a mutation in the last five exons or the 3' untranslated region of NPR3 that could change the struc-ture or expression of the NPR3 gene. However, in the Mongolian ethnic group, these SNPs were not associated with the incidence of hyperten-sion, suggesting population heterogeneity for the genetic factors that contribute to hypertensio.
ic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) is the clearance receptor for the cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs). By modulating the level of NPs, NPR3 plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Although the physiological functions of NPR3 have been explored, little is known about its regulation in health or disease. MicroRNAs play an essential role in the post-transcriptional expression of many genes. Our aim was to investigate potential microRNA-based regulation of NPR3 in multiple models. Hypoxic challenge elevated levels of NPPB and ADM mRNA, as well as NT-proBNP and MR-proADM in human left ventricle derived cardiac cells (HCMa), and in the corresponding conditioned medium, as revealed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. NPR3 was decreased while NPR1 was increased by hypoxia at mRNA and protein levels in HCMa. Down-regulation of NPR3 mRNA was also observed in infarct and peri-infarct cardiac tissue from rats undergoing myocardial infarction. From microRNA microarray analyses and microRNA target predictive databases, miR-100 was selected as a candidate regulator of NPR3 expression. Further analyses confirmed up-regulation of miR-100 in hypoxic cells and associated conditioned media. Antagomir-based silencing of miR-100 enhanced NPR3 expression in HCMa. Furthermore, miR-100 levels were markedly up-regulated in rat hearts and in peripheral blood after myocardial infarction and in the blood from heart failure patients. Results from this study point to a role for miR-100 in the regulation of NPR3 expression, and suggest a possible therapeutic target for modulation of NP bioactivity in heart diseas.
astoma is the most frequent malignant brain tumor of the posterior fossa in children and is considered an embryonal tumor. It has been suggested that medulloblastomas be categorized into 4 distinct molecular subgroups- WNT (DKK1), SHH (SFRP1), Group 3 (NPR3), or Group 4 (KCNA1)-since each subgroup is distinct and there is no overlap. The authors report on a 13-year-old boy with medulloblastoma. He presented with sudden-onset nausea and vomiting due to intratumoral hemorrhage. The medulloblastoma was thought to be in an early developmental stage because the tumor volume was extremely small. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor was mainly composed of DKK1- and NPR3-positive areas. The individual areas of the tumor stained only for DKK1 or NPR3, with no overlap-that is, DKK1 and NPR3 expression were mutually exclusive. Samples obtained by laser microdissection of individual areas and subjected to mass spectrometry confirmed that the expression patterns of proteins were different. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosome 6 showed there were 2 distinct types of cells that exhibited monosomy or disomy of chromosome 6. These results demonstrated that distinct subtypes of medulloblastoma may be present within a single tumor, an observation that has not been previously reported. Our findings in this case indicate that early-stage medulloblastoma may include more than 1 distinct subtype and hint at factors involved in the origin and development of medulloblastoma.
triuretic peptide (CNP) has been demonstrated in human and mouse models to play critical roles in cartilage homeostasis and endochondral bone formation. Indeed, targeted inactivation of the genes encoding CNP results in severe dwarfism and skeletal defects with a reduction in growth plate chondrocytes. Conversely, cartilage-specific overexpression of CNP was observed to rescue the phenotype of CNP deficient mice and significantly enhanced bone growth caused by growth plate expansion. In&nbsp;vitro studies reported that exogenous CNP influenced chondrocyte differentiation, proliferation and matrix synthesis with the response dependent on CNP concentration. The chondroprotective effects were shown to be mediated by natriuretic peptide receptor (Npr)2 and enhanced synthesis of cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) production. Recent studies also showed certain homeostatic effects of CNP are mediated by the clearance inactivation receptor, Npr3, highlighting several mechanisms in maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the CNP signalling systems are complex and influenced by multiple factors that will lead to altered signalling and tissue dysfunction. This review will discuss the differential role of CNP signalling in regulating cartilage and bone homeostasis and how the pathways are influenced by age, inflammation or sex. Evidence indicates that enhanced CNP signalling may prevent growth retardation and protect cartilage in patients with inflammatory joint diseas.
term molecular changes in the central nervous system constitute an important aspect of general anaesthesia, but little is known about to what extent these molecular changes are affected by anaesthesia duration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of short duration (20 min) general anaesthesia with isoflurane or avertin on the expression of 20 selected genes in the mouse hippocampus at 1 and 4 days after anaesthesi.
leven-weeks-old male mice received one of the following treatments: 20 min of avertin-induced anaesthesia (n=11), 20 min of isoflurane-induced anaesthesia (n=10) and no anaesthesia (n=5). One and four days after anaesthesia, gene expression in the hippocampus was determined with reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactio.
that anaesthesia led to the upregulation of six genes: Hspd1 (heat shock protein 1), Plat (tissue plasminogen activator) and Npr3 (natriuretic peptide receptor 3) were upregulated only 1 day after anaesthesia, whereas Thbs4 (thrombospondin 4) was upregulated only 4 days after anaesthesia. Syp (synaptophysin) and Mgst1 (microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1) were upregulated at both time points. Hspd1, Mgst1 and Syp expression was increased regardless of the anaesthetic used, Npr3 and Plat were increased only in mice exposed to avertin, and Thbs4 was upregulated only after isoflurane-induced anaesthesi.
y shows that some of the effects of short general anaesthesia on gene expression in the mouse hippocampus persist for at least 4 day.
te the impact of a functional genetic variant in the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor, NPR3, on circulating natriuretic peptides (NPs) and myocardial structure and function in the general communit.
s an important role in the clearance of NPs and through direct signaling mechanisms modulates smooth muscle cell function and cardiac fibroblast proliferation. A NPR3 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2270915, resulting in a N521D substitution in the intracellular catalytic domain that interacts with Gi could affect receptor function. Whether this SNP is associated with alterations in NPs levels and altered cardiac structure and function is unknow.
es of 1931 randomly selected residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota were genotyped. Plasma NT-proANP1-98, ANP1-28, proBNP1-108, NT-proBNP1-76, BNP1-32 and BNP3-32 levels were measured. All subjects underwent comprehensive echocardiograph.
frequencies for rs2270915 were as follows: (A/A 60%, A/G 36%, G/G 4%). All analyses performed were for homozygotes G/G versus wild type A/A plus the heterozygotes A/G. Diastolic dysfunction was significantly more common (p = 0.007) in the homozygotes G/G (43%) than the A/A+A/G (28%) group. Multivariate regression adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and hypertension demonstrated rs2270915 to be independently associated with diastolic dysfunction (odds ratio 1.94, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in NPs levels between the 2 groups suggesting that the clearance function of the receptor was not affecte.
nymous NPR3 SNP is independently associated with diastolic dysfunction and this association does not appear to be related to alterations in circulating levels of natriuretic peptide.
ine the effect of gestational hypertension on the developmental origins of blood pressure (BP), altered kidney gene expression, salt-sensitivity and cardiac hypertrophy (CH) in adult offsprin.
ce lacking atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP-/-) were used as a model of gestational hypertension. Heterozygous ANP+/- offspring was bred from crossing either ANP+/+ females with ANP-/- males yielding ANP+/-(WT) offspring, or from ANP-/- females with ANP+/+ males yielding ANP+/-(KO) offspring. Maternal BP during pregnancy was measured using radiotelemetry. At 14weeks of age, offspring BP, gene and protein expression were measured in the kidney with real-time quantitative PCR, receptor binding assay and ELIS.
) offspring exhibited normal BP at 14weeks of age, but displayed significant CH (P&lt;0.001) as compared to ANP+/-(WT) offspring. ANP+/-(KO) offspring exhibited significantly increased gene expression of natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) (P&lt;0.001) and radioligand binding studies demonstrated significantly reduced NPR-C binding (P=0.01) in the kidney. Treatment with high salt diet increased BP (P&lt;0.01) and caused LV hypertrophy (P&lt;0.001) and interstitial myocardial fibrosis only in ANP+/-(WT) and not ANP+/-(KO) offspring, suggesting gestational hypertension programs the offspring to show resistance to salt-induced hypertension and LV remodeling. Our data demonstrate that altered maternal environments can determine the salt-sensitive phenotype of offsprin.
 N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen, we have identified two skeletal morphology mutants, Skm1 and Skm2. Positional cloning and candidate gene sequencing localized the causative point mutations within the genes coding for natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) and filamin b (FLNB), respectively. Mice that carry a mutation in Npr3 exhibit a skeletal overgrowth phenotype, resulting in an elongated body and kyphosis. Skm2 mice, carrying a mutation in Flnb, present with scoliosis and lordosis. These mutant mice will serve as useful models for the study of vertebral malformation.
nt study examined the effect of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and biomechanical signals on anabolic and catabolic activities in chondrocyte/agarose construct.
ic peptide (Npr) 2 and 3 expression were compared in non-diseased (grade 0/1) and diseased (grade IV) human cartilage by immunofluoresence microscopy and western blotting. In separate experiments, constructs were cultured under free-swelling conditions or subjected to dynamic compression with CNP, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the Npr2 antagonist P19 or the Npr3 agonist cANF⁴⁻²³. Nitric oxide (NO) production, prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) release, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis and CNP concentration were quantified using biochemical assays. Gene expression of Npr2, Npr3, CNP, aggrecan and collagen type II were assessed by real-time qPCR. Two-way ANOVA and a post hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-test were used to analyse the dat.
nt study demonstrates increased expression of natriuretic peptide receptors in diseased or older cartilage (age 70) when compared to non-diseased tissue (age 60) which showed minimal expression. There was strong parallelism in the actions of CNP on cGMP induction resulting in enhanced GAG synthesis and reduction of NO and PGE₂ release induced by IL-1β. Inhibition of Npr2 with P19 maintained catabolic activities whilst specific agonism of Npr3 with cANF⁴⁻²³ had the opposite effect and reduced NO and PGE₂ release. Co-stimulation with CNP and dynamic compression enhanced anabolic activities and inhibited catabolic effects induced by IL-1β. The presence of CNP and the Npr2 antagonist abolished the anabolic response to mechanical loading and prevented loading-induced inhibition of NO and PGE₂ release. In contrast, the presence of the Npr3 agonist had the opposite effect and increased GAG synthesis and cGMP levels in response to mechanical loading and reduced NO and PGE₂ release comparable to control samples. In addition, CNP concentration and natriuretic peptide receptor expression were increased with dynamic compressio.
l loading mediates endogenous CNP release leading to increased natriuretic peptide signalling. The loading-induced CNP/Npr2/cGMP signalling route mediates anabolic events and prevents catabolic activities induced by IL-1β. The CNP pathway therefore represents a potentially chondroprotective intervention for patients with OA, particularly when combined with physiotherapeutic approaches to stimulate biomechanical signal.
D- The primary role of natriuretic peptide receptor-3 (NPR3) or NPR-C is in the clearance of natriuretic peptides that play an important role in modulating intravascular volume and vascular tone. Genetic variation in NPR3 has been associated with variation in blood pressure and obesity. Despite the importance of NPR3, sequence variation in the gene has not been addressed using DNA from different ethnic populations. We set out to identify and functionally characterize genetic variation in NPR3 in 3 ethnic groups. METHODS AND RESULTS- DNA samples from 96 European American, 96 African American, and 96 Han Chinese American healthy subjects were used to resequence NPR3 exons, splice junctions, and flanking regions. We identified 105 polymorphisms, 50 of which were novel, including 8 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 7 were novel. Expression constructs were created for the nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms. HEK293 cells were transfected with constructs for wild type and variant allozymes; and recombinant proteins were measured by quantitative Western blot analysis. The most significant change in NPR3 protein was observed for the Arg146 variant allozyme, with 20% of wild-type protein, primarily because of autophagy-dependent degradation. NPR3 structural modeling confirmed that the Arg146 variant protein was not compatible with wild-type conformation and could result in protein misfolding or instability. CONCLUSIONS- Multiple novel NPR3 genetic polymorphisms were identified in 3 ethnic groups. The Arg146 allozyme displayed a significant decrease in protein quantity because of degradation mediated predominantly by autophagy. This genetic variation could have a significant effect on the metabolism of natriuretic peptides with potential clinical implication.
ic peptide type C (NPPC) and its receptor natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2) regulate cGMP in ovarian follicles and participate in maintaining oocyte meiotic arrest. We investigated the regulation of Nppc expression in mouse granulosa cells in vivo and in vitro. In mural granulosa cells (MGCs) in vivo, eCG caused an increase in Nppc mRNA, and subsequent human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment caused a decrease. A culture system was established for MGCs isolated from follicles not stimulated with equine chorionic gonadotropin to further define the mechanisms controlling Nppc expression. In this system, expression of Nppc mRNA was increased by estradiol (E2), with augmentation by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but FSH or luteinizing hormone (LH) alone had no effect. Thus, estrogens are important for regulating Nppc expression, probably by feedback mechanisms enhancing the action of gonadotropins. In MGCs treated with E2 plus FSH in vitro, subsequent treatment with EGF, but not LH, decreased Nppc mRNA. MGCs express higher levels of both Nppc and Lhcgr mRNAs than cumulus cells. Oocyte-derived paracrine factors suppressed cumulus cell Lhcgr but not Nppc expression. Thus, higher Nppc expression by MGCs is not the result of oocyte suppression of expression in cumulus cells. Another possible regulator of the LH-induced NPPC decrease is NPR3, an NPPC clearance receptor. Human chorionic gonadotropin increased Npr3 expression in vivo and LH increased Npr3 mRNA in cultured MGCs, independently of EGF receptor activation. Interestingly, despite the increase in Npr3 mRNA, the hCG-induced decrease in ovarian NPPC occurred normally in an Npr3 mutant (lgj), thus NPR3 probably does not participate in regulation of ovarian NPPC levels or oocyte developmen.
ated on human chromosome 5 (5p14-p13), encodes the natriuretic peptide receptor type C (NPR-C) that is mainly known as the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor. Involvement of NPR3 in susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, i.e. hypertension, has been previously shown. With regard to stroke predisposition, evidence for a potential role of genetic variation within or nearby NPR3 has been suggested by a previous genome wide association stud.
igated the contribution to early-onset ischemic stroke susceptibility of the NPR3 -55 C&gt;A transition by genotyping this variant in an Italian cohort of 368 cases and 335 control.
ivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking habit and diabetes, a significant association of the -55 AA genotype with stroke was observed (OR=3.2, 95% CI 1.2-8.3, p=0.016). Remarkably, the polymorphism remained associated with stroke after adjusting for hypertensive statu.
vation obtained in an Italian cohort of early onset ischemic strokes suggests that a NPR3 promoter gene variant could have a role on cerebrovascular disease susceptibilit.
e natriuretic peptide (CNP) has anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-migratory properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of CNP and its receptors (NPR2 and NPR3) in a human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells) as well as in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC). Impact of both, LPS and human oxLDL on expression pattern of CNP and its receptors shall be studie.
e cultured in standard medium with or without LPS or oxLDL. Expression levels of CNP, NPR2, NPR3, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CD14 and CD68 were measured at baseline, 24h, and 48.
expression of all analysed genes was significantly higher in PBMC compared to THP-1 cells (all p&lt;0.05). Expression levels of CNP, IL-1β, IL-6, and CD14 were significantly increased in PBMC following stimulation with LPS. In contrast, in THP-1 cells stimulated by LPS, significant increase in expression was found only for IL-6 (p=0.007). In THP-1 cells, oxLDL increased the expression levels of NPR3, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CD14, and CD68 significantly. In contrast, expression level of NPR2 was diminished by oxLDL (p=0.007). In PBMC NPR3 was significantly down-regulated (p=0.002). Treatment with oxLDL for 48h increased NPR2/3-ratio significantly in PBMC (22.5 vs. 4.8, p=0.010). In contrast, in THP-1 cells, NPR2/3-ratio was lowered significantly by oxLDL (0.31 vs. 17.0, p=0.008.
 with LPS or oxLDL leads to diverging changes in gene expression PBMC and THP-1 cells. With respect to CNP and its receptors, data gained from THP-1 cells should be further validated using naive human peripheral blood monocytes. However, THP-1 cells can serve as a negative control for e.g. future signalling pathway studies related to oxLDL effect on CNP system in monocytes/macrophage.
igate whether natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR3) gene polymorphisms were associated with ischemic stroke (IS) and hypertension (a conventional risk factor for stroke), we conducted a case-control study in Chinese Han population. We found that rs696831, located in intron 2, was associated with IS. In addition, we found that rs16890208 and rs700925, in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other in intron 3, were associated with hypertension. The A allele of the rs16890208, T allele of the rs700925, and the AT haplotype, derived from rs16890208 and rs700925, increased the risk of hypertension with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.74 (95% CI = 1.23-2.47), 1.72 (95% CI = 1.21-2.42), and 1.54 (95% CI = 1.14-2.08), respectively. Further, we found that rs11745562 and rs2270915, in LD with each other in intron 5 and exon 8, were associated with hypertension. The A allele of the rs11745562 and the G allele of the rs2270915 increased the risk of hypertension with ORs of 1.53 (95% CI = 1.07-2.19) and 1.55 (95% CI = 1.08-2.22), respectively. Therefore, we provided novel evidences that polymorphisms or haplotype in NPR3 gene may influence the risk of IS or hypertension independently in Chinese populatio.
triuretic peptide (CNP) has anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and anti-migratory properties. No data exist on the presence of CNP in human atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid artery. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse qualitatively the distribution pattern and characteristics of CNP and its receptors in both, early and advanced human carotid plaques, as well as in stable and unstable lesions. In addition, the aim of this study was to evaluate CNP and its receptors as possible biomarkers to predict plaque stability in advanced lesion.
carotid artery plaques of 40 asymptomatic patients (20 histologically stable and 20 histologically unstable) and early arteriosclerotic lesions of three patients were analyse.
el of CNP was similar in patients with stable and unstable plaques (196&nbsp;±&nbsp;19&nbsp;pg&nbsp;ml(-1) vs. 198&nbsp;±&nbsp;25&nbsp;pg&nbsp;ml(-1), p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.948). Expression level of natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) was significantly higher in unstable plaques compared to stable plaques (5.6&nbsp;±&nbsp;1.8% vs. 1.7&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.5%, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.045). Expression levels of CNP and NPR2 were higher in unstable plaques but the differences were not statistically significant. The distribution pattern of CNP, NPR2 and NPR3 varied qualitatively between early and advanced carotid plaques. No relevant histological differences were observed with respect to plaque stabilit.
y shows the presence of CNP and its receptors in atherosclerotic plaques of human carotid artery, with increased expression of NPR3 in histologically unstable plaques. In this study, serum CNP was not associated with histological plaque stability. In future, larger studies are required to further evaluate whether proteins of the CNP axis would be useful as biomarker.
ion in diabetes is characterized by abnormal sodium homeostasis, suggesting a particular role of natriuretic peptide pathway. Natriuretic peptides can affect blood pressure (BP) through their plasma concentrations, which are dependent on their receptor activities. We thus assessed the association between nine NPR3 gene polymorphisms and BP levels in patients with type 2 diabete.
le nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the haplotype structure of the NPR3 gene were genotyped in the 3,126 French Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria or Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) trial participants. We then used a second population (Diabete de type 2, Nephropathie et Genetique [DIAB2NEPHROGENE]/Survie, Diabete de type 2 et Genetique [SURDIAGENE] study) of 2,452 patients for the purpose of replication. Finally, we separately investigated subjects selected according to their rs 2270915SNP genotypes for their BP response to salt restrictio.
CAR patients, three SNPs (rs6889608, rs1173773, and rs2270915) were significantly associated with systolic BP (SBP). The effect of the rs2270915 was replicated in the second step population: AA homozygotes had a lower SBP than G carriers (137.4 ± 19.1 vs. 140.0 ± 20.2 mmHg, P = 0.004). The rs2270915 influenced the response of SBP to salt reduction, with AA homozygous patients showing greater reductions after restriction of salt intake compared with G carriers: -20 mmHg (-43 to -8) vs. -3 (-20 to +7); P = 0.00.
a consistent and significant association between the rs2270915 polymorphism of the NPR3 gene and SBP in diabetic patients. This genetic variation may affect pressure response to changes in dietary sodiu.
triuretic peptide (CNP) is an endothelium-derived vasorelaxant, exerting anti-atherogenic actions in the vasculature and salvaging the myocardium from ischaemic injury. The cytoprotective effects of CNP are mediated in part via the G(i) -coupled natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)3. As GPCRs are well-known to control cell proliferation, we investigated if NPR3 activation underlies effects of CNP on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesi.
tion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RAoSMC) and endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells from NPR3 knockout (KO) mice was investigated in vitr.
-1 µM) facilitated HUVEC proliferation and inhibited RAoSMC growth concentration-dependently. The pro- and anti-mitogenic effects of CNP were blocked by the NPR3 antagonist M372049 (10 µM) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (30 µM) and were absent in cells from NPR3 KO mice. Activation of ERK 1/2 by CNP was inhibited by Pertussis toxin (100 ng·mL⁻¹) and M372049 (10 µM). In HUVEC, ERK 1/2 activation enhanced expression of the cell cycle promoter, cyclin D1, whereas in RAoSMC, ERK 1/2 activation increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p21(waf1/cip1) and p27(kip1).
f the vasoprotective profile of CNP is mediated via NPR3-dependent ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in augmented endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth. This pathway may offer an innovative approach to reversing the endothelial damage and vascular smooth muscle hyperplasia that characterize many vascular disorder.
ern Europeans are among the tallest of human populations. The increase in body height in these people appears to have reached a plateau, suggesting the ubiquitous presence of an optimal environment in which genetic factors may have exerted a particularly strong influence on human growth. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of body height using 2.2 million markers in 10 074 individuals from three Dutch and one German population-based cohorts. Upon genotyping, the 12 most significantly height-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from this GWAS in 6912 additional individuals of Dutch and Swedish origin, a genetic variant (rs6717918) on chromosome 2q37.1 was found to be associated with height at a genome-wide significance level (P(combined) = 3.4 x 10(-9)). Notably, a second SNP (rs6718438) located approximately 450 bp away and in strong LD (r(2) = 0.77) with rs6717918 was previously found to be suggestive of a height association in 29 820 individuals of mainly northwestern European ancestry, and the over-expression of a nearby natriuretic peptide precursor type C (NPPC) gene, has been associated with overgrowth and skeletal anomalies. We also found a SNP (rs10472828) located on 5p14 near the natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (NPR3) gene, encoding a receptor of the NPPC ligand, to be associated with body height (P(combined) = 2.1 x 10(-7)). Taken together, these results suggest that variation in the C-type natriuretic peptide signaling pathway, involving the NPPC and NPR3 genes, plays an important role in determining human body heigh.
ar dysfunction (VnD) after primary coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Natriuretic peptides have compensatory vasodilatory, natriuretic, and paracrine influences on myocardial failure and ischemia. The authors hypothesized that natriuretic peptide system gene variants independently predict risk of VnD after primary coronary artery bypass graftin.
f 1,164 patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass at two institutions were prospectively enrolled. After prospectively defined exclusions, 697 patients of European descent (76 with VnD) were analyzed. VnD was defined as need for at least 2 new inotropes and/or new mechanical ventricular support after coronary artery bypass grafting. A total of 139 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 7 genes (NPPA, NPPB, NPPC, NPR1, NPR2, NPR3, CORIN) were genotyped. SNPs univariately associated with VnD were entered into logistic regression models adjusting for clinical covariates predictive of VnD. To control for multiple comparisons, permutation analyses were conducted for all SNP association.
usting for clinical covariates and multiple comparisons within each gene, seven NPPA/NPPB SNPs (rs632793, rs6668352, rs549596, rs198388, rs198389, rs6676300, rs1009592) were associated with decreased risk of postoperative VnD (additive model; odds ratios 0.44-0.55; P = 0.010- 0.036) and four NPR3 SNPs (rs700923, rs16890196, rs765199, rs700926) were associated with increased risk of postoperative VnD (recessive model; odds ratios 3.89-4.28; P = 0.007-0.034.
ariation within the NPPA/NPPB and NPR3 genes is associated with risk of VnD after primary coronary artery bypass grafting. Knowledge of such genotypic predictors may result in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying postoperative Vn.
s a novel skeletal muscle-derived secretory factor that was isolated by our group. Musclin contains a region homologous to natriuretic peptides (NPs). This study investigated the interaction between musclin and NP receptors (NPRs). Musclin specifically bound to NPR3, but not to NPR1 or NPR2. Musclin and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) competed for binding to NPR3. We conducted binding assays using various synthetic musclin peptides and mutant musclin proteins. The first NP-homologous region in musclin ((88)LDRL(91)) and the second homologous region ((117)MDRI(120)) were responsible cooperatively for high-affinity binding to NPR3. The first NP-homologous region was more importantly associated with binding to NPR3, than the second homologous region. The competitive nature of musclin with ANP for the natriuretic clearance receptor NPR3 was also confirmed in vivo. We conclude that musclin binds to NPR3 competitively with ANP and may affect ANP concentrations in a local or systemic manne.
ic peptides (NP) regulate cardiovascular homeostasis and have multiple metabolic properties. Decreased levels of NP or &quot;natriuretic handicap&quot; are signs of insulin resistance such as central obesity. Increased expression of NP clearance receptor (NPRC) in sc adipose tissue (SAT) was observed in insulin-resistant subject.
esized that insulin acutely regulates NP receptor expression in adipose tissu.
B, and NPRC mRNA expression was measured in paired samples of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and SAT from 157 subjects (108 with type 2 diabetes). The effect of insulin on NPR gene expression in SAT was studied in euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp experiments. Additionally, the effect of insulin and glucose on NPR expression in the culture of primary human monocytes and macrophages was teste.
NPRC gene expression was higher in VAT compared with SAT (P &lt; 0.01), but only NPRC gene expression strongly correlated with fasting insulin levels (r = 0.65, P = 0.04 × 10(-3); and r = 0.54, P = 0.002, for VAT and SAT, respectively). NPRB expression was lower in VAT than in SAT in subjects with type 2 diabetes and was lower compared with nondiabetic subjects. NPRC gene expression was up-regulated in SAT during both euglycemic- and hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps (P = 0.038 and P = 0.048, respectively), and was increased in high glucose and insulin treatment in monocytes (70.2%; P = 0.01), but not in mature macrophage.
ncreased expression of NPRC in SAT independently of circulating glucose concentrations. Thus, insulin might suppress circulating NP via up-regulation of NPRC expression in obesity, providing a novel link between hyperinsulinemia and obesit.
ty of mammals to resist body fat accumulation is linked to their ability to expand the number and activity of &quot;brown adipocytes&quot; within white fat depots. Activation of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) can induce a functional &quot;brown-like&quot; adipocyte phenotype. As cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) and β-AR agonists are similarly potent at stimulating lipolysis in human adipocytes, we investigated whether NPs could induce human and mouse adipocytes to acquire brown adipocyte features, including a capacity for thermogenic energy expenditure mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In human adipocytes, atrial NP (ANP) and ventricular NP (BNP) activated PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and UCP1 expression, induced mitochondriogenesis, and increased uncoupled and total respiration. At low concentrations, ANP and β-AR agonists additively enhanced expression of brown fat and mitochondrial markers in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Mice exposed to cold temperatures had increased levels of circulating NPs as well as higher expression of NP signaling receptor and lower expression of the NP clearance receptor (Nprc) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). NPR-C(-/-) mice had markedly smaller WAT and BAT depots but higher expression of thermogenic genes such as Ucp1. Infusion of BNP into mice robustly increased Ucp1 and Pgc-1α expression in WAT and BAT, with corresponding elevation of respiration and energy expenditure. These results suggest that NPs promote &quot;browning&quot; of white adipocytes to increase energy expenditure, defining the heart as a central regulator of adipose tissue biolog.
s peptides, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and bradykinin (BK), have been proposed to play a role in the female sexual arousal response by exerting relaxation of clitoral, labial, and vaginal smooth muscle. While the effects of endogenous peptides on the human male erectile tissue have already been described, only very few studies have been conducted to investigate the peptidergic control of female genital tissues, including the vagin.
ate the expression of mRNA specifically encoding for peptide receptors in the human vagina and the effects of VIP, CNP, and BK on the tension induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) of isolated human vaginal wall smooth muscle. The production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in response to exposure of the tissue to the peptides was also measure.
ssion of mRNA encoding for receptor proteins specific for VIP, CNP, and BK were investigated by means of molecular biology (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] analysis). Using the organ bath technique, the effects of VIP, CNP, and BK (0.1 nM to 1 µM) on the tension induced by 0.1 µM ET-1 of human vaginal strips were investigated. The tissue was also exposed to three different concentrations of VIP, CNP, and BK (0.01 µM, 0.1 µM, 1 µM) and the production of cAMP and cGMP determined by means of radioimmunoassay.
ize the expression of peptide receptors in the human vagina and measure the relaxation exerted by BK, CNP, and VIP on the contraction induced by ET-1 of isolated human vaginal tissue. In addition, the effects of the peptides on the production of cAMP and cGMP were also elucidate.
alysis revealed the expression of mRNA transcripts encoding for the VIP receptors VIP1R/vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor type 1 (VPAC1) and VIP2R/VPAC2, CNP receptors natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPRA), natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPRB) and natriuretic peptide receptor type C (NPRC), and BK receptor B2R. The tension induced by ET-1 was reversed by the peptides with the following rank order of efficacy: BK (21.7%) &gt; VIP (20.9%) &gt; CNP (13.3%). The relaxing effects of VIP and BK were paralleled by a 4.8-fold and fivefold increase in cAMP, while the production of cGMP was stimulated 38-fold and 119-fold in the presence of CNP or BK, respectivel.
ts are in support of the hypothesis that endogenous peptides may contribute to the control of human vaginal smooth muscle tone through the involvement of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathway.
investigations have shown that the plasma levels of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) increase during acute cardiac allograft rejection as diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy. Successful immunosuppressant treatment decreased plasma BNP levels, suggesting a role for BNP in transplantation immunity. We tested a possible immunomodulatory effect of the natriuretic peptides (NPs) BNP, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and C-type NP (CNP) using the unidirectional mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR.
es were isolated from the lymph nodes of Brown Norway (BN) and Lewis (L) rats. BN lymphocytes were gamma-irradiated to inhibit DNA synthesis. Lymphocytes at 2.5 x 10(6) cell/ml were mixed (at an L:BN ratio of 4:1) and incubated. On Days 2 and 3, ANF (10(-6) to 10(-11) mol/liter), BNP (10(-5) to 10(-11) mol/liter), or CNP (10(-6) to 10(-12) mol/liter) were added. Cell proliferation was measured on Day .
ranscript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of BN and L lymphocytes detected NP receptor (NPR) mRNA amplicons of the expected size. MLR induced an increase in relative receptor abundance as follows: NPRA &gt; NPRB &gt; NPRC. ANF and BNP significantly inhibited up to approximately 50% lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 10(-11) to 10(-6) mol/liter, whereas CNP significantly decreased lymphocyte proliferation only modestly (approximately 20%) at 10(-8) mol/liter and at 10(-6) mol/lite.
and BNP have immunomodulatory functions, although the response to cardiac rejection observed clinically involves increases in plasma levels of BNP only. This is likely related to BNP gene promoter sequences previously reported to be responsive to specific cytokines and related substances. The modulation of the MLR by NP suggests a possible clinical use of these peptides in transplantation immunit.
triuretic peptide (ANP) is a known vascular antipermeability and antiangiogenic factor, but its possible alteration during the early stages of diabetic retinopathy has not yet been explored. The present study sought to investigate the expression of ANP and its receptors using a model of streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes in the ra.
was induced in male Wistar rats by an intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Age matched animals served as control. One and 3 months after the onset of diabetes, the expression of ANP mRNA and that of its receptors (NPRA, NPRB, NPRC) and the immunoreactive ANP was quantified in retinal tissue by quantitative real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and radioimmunoassay, respectively. The locations of ANP and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in normal and diabetic retinas were also established by immunohistochemistr.
tion in the gene expression of the retinal natriuretic peptide system was noted after 1 month of diabetes. However, 3 months after the onset of diabetes, significantly diminished ANP and NPRC mRNA levels were detected in the retina of diabetic rats compared to controls, while NPRA, NPRB mRNA levels remained unchanged. At this time point, retinal ANP concentrations were significantly diminished in the diabetic rats compared to control rats. However, at 1 month retinal ANP concentrations in diabetic retina were similar to control rats. Diabetes caused the downregulation of ANP protein expression in the layers of the retina at 3 months after the induction of diabetes. ANP immunoreactivity was detected in the cell bodies of the astrocytes and in their processes enveloping vessel.
egulation of ANP and NPRC in retinas of diabetic rats suggests a role for this peptide in experimental diabetic retinopathy. Further studies should address the possible involvement of the ANP/NPRC system in the pathophysiology of diabetic retinopath.
es of natriuretic peptides (NP) have been isolated: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The NP family elicits a number of vascular, renal and endocrine effects that help to maintain blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume. These effects are mediated by the specific binding of NP to cell surface receptors that have been characterized, purified and cloned from cells of the vasculature, kidney, adrenal gland and brain. There are 3 subtypes of NP receptors: type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPRA), type B natriuretic peptide receptor (NPRB), and type C natriuretic peptide receptor (NPRC). All 3 subtypes affect cellular second messenger activity. NPRA and NPRB are guanylyl cyclase receptors, and their activation increases cGMP levels. Activation of NPRC results in inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Human NPRA has a high structural homology with human NPRB, and contains a highly-conserved guanylyl cyclase domain. ANP and BNP bind primarily to NPRA, which is found in the vasculature, causing vasodilation and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. The present paper contains a review of NPs and their receptors and the genetic contribution of the NP system to cardiovascular diseases such as essential hypertension and myocardial infarctio.
triuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are loop-shaped peptidic hormones that have multiple actions on body fluid homeostasis. Their physiological effects are mediated through the activation of their receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA). This receptor is a member of the membrane guanylyl cyclase family and catalyzes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production following its activation. To map the binding site of human NPRA, we applied the methionine proximity assay method to this receptor. We photolabeled NPRA mutants, presenting a single methionine in the binding domain of the receptor, and used benzoylphenylalanine- (Bpa-) substituted peptides at positions 0, 3, 18, 26, and 28 of the ligand. We identified that the N-terminus of the peptide is interacting with the region between Asp(177) and Val(183) of the receptor. Arg(3) is interacting in the vicinity of Phe(172). Leu(18) binds close to Val(116). Phe(26) binds in the vicinity of His(195), and the C-terminal Tyr(28) is located close to Met(173). We next proceeded with photolabeling of a dual Bpa-substituted peptide and showed that the N-terminus and Leu(18) interact with opposite receptor subunits. On the basis of our results, a molecular model of peptide-bound NPRA was developed by homology modeling with the C-type natriuretic peptide- (CNP-) bound natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPRC) crystal structure. The model has been validated by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work provides a rational basis for interpreting and predicting natriuretic peptide binding to the human NPR.
distensibility, assessed by the pulse-wave velocity (PWV), is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. We investigated whether natriuretic peptides, acting locally, modify conduit artery distensibility in vivo. All studies were conducted in anesthetized sheep (n = 18) by using a validated ovine hindlimb model. In brief, the PWV was calculated, with the use of the foot-to-foot methodology, from two pressure waveforms recorded simultaneously with a high-fidelity dual pressure-sensing catheter placed in the common iliac artery. Drugs were infused either proximally, via the catheter to perfuse the segment of artery under study, or distally, via the sheath to control for any reflex changes in flow or sympathetic activation. First, the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and c-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) were studied. Second, the role of endogenous ANP was investigated by infusing the natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPRA)-selective receptor antagonist A71915. Third, A71915 was coinfused with ANP. Fourth, the NPRC-selective agonist cANF was infused. Infusion of CNP or des-[Gln18Ser19Gly20Leu21Gly22]-ANF-(4-23)-NH2 (cANF) had no effect on iliac PWV. However, infusion of ANP, and to a lesser degree BNP, resulted in a reduction in PWV (-9%; P &lt; 0.01 and -6%; P &lt; 0.05, respectively). A71915 increased iliac PWV from 2.97 +/- 0.13 to 3.06 +/- 0.13 m/s; P &lt; 0.01. Coinfusion of A71915 with ANP completely abolished the effects of ANP (P &lt; 0.01). Importantly, ANP-BNP infusion via the sheath did not alter PWV. In conclusion, ANP, and to a lesser extent BNP, modify large artery distensibility via the NPRA receptor. Neither CNP nor cANF altered PWV, suggesting that the NPRB and NPRC receptors do not acutely influence distensibility in viv.
 of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) gene and the clearance receptor of the ANP (NPRC) gene in hypertensive groups of African ancestry are unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between both ANP and NPRC gene polymorphisms and hypertension in Black South African.
nts, diagnosed as having essential hypertension according to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements (mean daytime diastolic BP&gt; 90 mm Hg) whilst off medication, and 278 normotensive control subjects of a similar African ancestry, were genotyped for polymorphic markers in intron 2 (which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a potentially functional exon 1 variant) and exon 3 (which leads to the extension of ANP by two additional arginines) of the ANP gene. Moreover, 64 hypertensives and 63 control from the same groups were genotyped for the cis-acting promoter/enhancer element of the NPRC gen.
onship between the exon 3 variant and either the presence (odds ratio = 1.075) or the severity (24-hour BP) of hypertension was noted. The intron 2 polymorphism occurred at a low frequency in the control group (frequency of subjects heterozygous for the variant = 6.1%), but was almost absent in the hypertensive group (frequency of heterozygotes = 1.7%). Consequently, a relationship between a normal BP and the intron 2 variant was noted (odds ratio = 0.28, confidence interval = 0.10-0.76, p &lt; 0.01, &lt;1% chance of false positive results). The NPRC gene variant occurred with an equally low frequency in both the hypertensive (4.7%) and the control (4.8%) group.
ts of the present study suggest that the ANP, but not the NPRC locus contributes to BP in subjects of African ancestr.
n is an important site of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-induced fluid extravasation into the systemic lymphatic system. The mechanism underlying this process was studied in a blood-perfused (1 ml min(-1)) rat spleen using the double occlusion technique. To ensure that our observations were spleen specific, a similar protocol was repeated in the hindquarters. Rat ANF(1-28), infused into the splenic artery of anaesthetized male rats, caused a dose-dependent (0.3-59 pmol min(-1)) increase in microvascular pressure from 11.3 +/- 0.7 to 14.9 +/- 0.5 mmHg and in post-capillary resistance from 7.2 +/- 0.6 to 10.1 +/- 1.1 mmHg ml(-1). ANF elicited no change in splenic pre-capillary resistance or in hindquarter haemodynamics. Intrasplenic ANF (6.5 pmol min(-1)) caused a sustained increase in intrasplenic fluid efflux from 0.1 +/- 0.1 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 ml min(-1), and in capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) from 1.2 +/- 0.5 to 2.4 +/- 0.6 ml mmHg-1 min-1 (100 g tissue)-1. Mechanical elevation of splenic intravascular pressure (from 11.3 +/- 0.7 to 22.4 +/- 0.2 mmHg) significantly increased intrasplenic fluid extravasation (from 0.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.4 +/- 0.3 ml min(-1)). The natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPRC)-specific agonist C-ANF(4-23) (12.5 and 125 pmol min(-1)) did not alter splenic intravascular pressure or pre-/post-capillary resistance. The ANF antagonist A71915 (8.3 and 83 pmol min-1), which blocks ANF-stimulated cGMP production via natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA), inhibited the ANF-induced changes in splenic microvascular pressure and post-capillary resistance. It is concluded that ANF enhances the extravasation of isoncotic fluid from the splenic vasculature both by raising intrasplenic microvascular pressure (increased post-capillary resistance) and by increasing filtration area. The constrictive activity of ANF on the splenic vasculature is mediated through NPR.
ance receptor for natriuretic peptides (NPRC), a candidate gene for essential hypertension, is highly expressed in adipose tissue, where is nutritionally regulated. The objectives of the present study were to sequence the human 5'-flanking regulatory region of NPRC, to identify allelic variants and their frequencies, and to study the genotype/phenotype correlation in hypertensive patient.
ymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct automated sequencing, a biallelic (A/C) polymorphism was detected at position -55 in a conserved promoter element named P1. The novel C(-55) variant makes the promoter sequence identical to the mouse gene and introduces a second Hgal site in the amplified DNA, allowing the genotyping of a large number of subjects. In a random sample of 232 white Caucasians the C(-55) allele was more commonly found (81.7% of all alleles) with 155 CC (66.8%), 69 AC (29.7%) and only eight AA (3.5%) genotypes. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were determined in 84 patients with essential hypertension. In the presence of obesity (body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) the homozygous CC hypertensives (n = 21) had significantly lower plasma ANP (33.6 +/- 11.1 pg/ml) compared with the AC patients (n = 11; 46.8 +/- 15.9 pg/ml; P = 0.01), whereas systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) had the opposite association (SBP 163.9 +/- 18.7 versus 150.9 +/- 12.9 and MBP 123.3 +/- 12 versus 114.5 +/- 5.9 mmHg; P&lt; 0.05). The difference in ANP levels were also present when overweight patients (BMI &gt; or = 27 kg/m2) were considere.
'ancestral' C(-55) variant of the NPRC P1 promoter is associated with lower ANP levels and higher SBP and MBP in obese hypertensives. The C(-55) variant, in the presence of increased adiposity, might reduce plasma ANP through increased NPRC-mediated ANP clearance, contributing to higher blood pressur.
nal actions of natriuretic peptides are dictated by the distribution of guanylyl cyclase-linked (NPRA and NPRB) and non-guanylyl cyclase-linked (NPRC) receptors. Natriuretic peptide receptors have previously been distinguished on the basis of their differential affinity for peptide fragments and analogues; however, most of the available ligands are not fully selective. We have used the specific guanylyl cyclase-linked receptor antagonist, HS-142-1, to investigate the differential distribution of natriuretic peptide receptor subtypes in the human, bovine and rat kidney. 2. Specific, high affinity 3-([125I]-iodotyrosyl)-rat-ANP-(1-28)([125I]-rANP1-28) binding sites were identified in all three species, localized to glomeruli, inner medulla, intrarenal arteries and regions in the outer medulla corresponding to vasa recta bundles. Binding sites were also identified in the smooth muscle lining of the hilar region in the bovine and rat kidney. 3. In the rat, [125I]-rANP1-28 binding was inhibited by unlabelled peptide sequences with a rank order of potency (rANP1-28 &gt; pCNP1-22 &gt; C-ANP4-23). The glomeruli exhibited a heterogeneous population of binding sites, C-ANP4-23 and pCNP1-22 producing a significantly better fit to a two component inhibition curve compared to the single component curve for rANP1-28. 4. Competitive inhibition experiments with the receptor selective ligands, C-ANP4-23 and HS-142-1, suggested that, like the rat, human and bovine glomeruli possessed a heterogeneous population of binding sites, whilst those in the inner medulla and intrarenal arteries of all three species represented a homogeneous population. Rat glomeruli exhibited a high proportion (&gt;80%) of the NPRc receptor subtype whereas in human and bovine glomeruli this receptor represented less than 20% of the total population, the majority of binding sites being HS-142-1-sensitive.5. C-ANP4-23 exhibited a significantly higher inhibitory potency for binding sites in rat glomeruli compared to those in human and bovine kidney whilst HS-142-1 was significantly more potent in the rat and bovine kidney compared to man. No evidence was found to suggest the presence of a renal NPRBreceptor subtype.6. The relative density, affinity and proportion of natriuretic receptor subtypes in the kidney exhibit significant species differences. HS-142-1 may be a valuable tool in further elucidating the localization and function of these receptors, but heterogeneity between species should be considered when selecting experimental model.
ic peptides (NPs), mainly produced in heart [atrial (ANP) and B-type (BNP)], brain (CNP), and kidney (urodilatin), decrease blood pressure and increase salt excretion. These functions are mediated by natriuretic peptide receptors A and B (NPRA and NPRB) having cytoplasmic guanylyl cyclase domains that are stimulated when the receptors bind ligand. A more abundantly expressed receptor (NPRC or C-type) has a short cytoplasmic domain without guanylyl cyclase activity. NPRC is thought to act as a clearance receptor, although it may have additional functions. To test how NPRC affects the cardiovascular and renal systems, we inactivated its gene (Npr3) in mice by homologous recombination. The half life of [125I]ANP in the circulation of homozygotes lacking NPRC is two-thirds longer than in the wild type, although plasma levels of ANP and BNP in heterozygotes and homozygotes are close to the wild type. Heterozygotes and homozygotes have a progressively reduced ability to concentrate urine, exhibit mild diuresis, and tend to be blood volume depleted. Blood pressure in the homozygotes is 8 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) below normal. These results are consistent with the sole cardiovascular/renal function of NPRC being to clear natriuretic peptides, thereby modulating local effects of the natriuretic peptide system. Unexpectedly, Npr3 -/- homozygotes have skeletal deformities associated with a considerable increase in bone turnover. The phenotype is consistent with the bone function of NPRC being to clear locally synthesized CNP and modulate its effects. We conclude that NPRC modulates the availability of the natriuretic peptides at their target organs, thereby allowing the activity of the natriuretic peptide system to be tailored to specific local need.
ic hypotension (OH), an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events, strongly correlates with hypertension. Recent genome-wide studies have identified new loci influencing blood pressure (BP) in populations, but their impact on OH remains unknow.
f 38 970 men and women of European ancestry from five population-based cohorts were included, of whom 2656 (6.8%) met the diagnostic criteria for OH (systolic/diastolic BP drop ≥ 20/10 mmHg within 3 min of standing). Thirty-one recently discovered BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined using an additive genetic model and the major allele as referent. Relations between OH, orthostatic systolic BP response, and genetic variants were assessed by inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. We found Bonferroni adjusted (P &lt; 0.0016) significant evidence for association between OH and the EBF1 locus (rs11953630, per-minor-allele odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 0.90, 0.85-0.96; P = 0.001), and nominal evidence (P &lt; 0.05) for CYP17A1 (rs11191548: 0.85, 0.75-0.95; P = 0.005), and NPR3-C5orf23 (rs1173771: 0.92, 0.87-0.98; P= 0.009) loci. Among subjects not taking BP-lowering drugs, three SNPs within the NPPA/NPPB locus were nominally associated with increased risk of OH (rs17367504: 1.13, 1.02-1.24; P = 0.02, rs198358: 1.10, 1.01-1.20; P = 0.04, and rs5068: 1.22, 1.04-1.43; P = 0.01). Moreover, an ADM variant was nominally associated with continuous orthostatic systolic BP response in the adjusted model (P= 0.04.
ll association between common gene variants in BP loci and OH was generally weak and the direction of effect inconsistent with resting BP findings. These results suggest that OH and resting BP share few genetic component.
ssure is a heritable trait influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or  ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease preventio.
iuretic peptide (ANP) lowers intraocular pressure in the eyes of humans and rabbits. We examined the effects of natriuretic peptides on cGMP formation and 125I-labelled-ANP binding to cultured cells derived from ciliary body epithelium, the site of aqueous humour formation in the eye. ANP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) at 1 microM stimulated cGMP formation 8.2(+/-1.2)-fold, 4.8(+/-0.6)-fold and 87.3(+/-12.1)-fold respectively. 125I-ANP bound to intact cells at a single site, with a dissociation constant KD=0.30+/-0.01 nM. BNP was as effective as ANP in displacing 125I-ANP, whereas CNP displaced label with a slightly higher IC50. 125I-ANP binding was displaced &gt;95% by c-ANP, a specific ligand for natriuretic peptide C receptors (NPR-C). Cross-linking of 125I-ANP to cells labelled predominantly a protein of Mr 62000. These data suggest that 125I-ANP binding was primarily to NPR-C, whereas cGMP stimulation occurred primarily via natriuretic peptide B receptors (NPR-B). Vasopressin and histamine, both activators of the inositol phosphate/diacylglycerol phosphate pathway in non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells, inhibited CNP stimulation of guanylate cyclase (NPR-B) and 125I-ANP binding (NPR-C) by 30-38%. Inhibition was mimicked by PMA, dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol didecanoate, whereas 4alpha phorbol didecanoate had no effect. Staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide both blocked inhibition of 125I-ANP binding and cGMP formation by PMA. These results suggest that protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulates both NPR-B and NPR-C. PKC down-regulation of NPR-B varied inversely with CNP concentration. Inhibition by 1 microM PMA was 30.6(+/-4.0)% with 500 nM CNP, but 83.4(+/-8.8)% with 10 nM CNP, indicating that increasing CNP could partially overcome inhibition by PMA. Since extracellular CNP levels were not affected by PKC activation, the effect of PKC on NPR-B is best explained as a reduction in NPR-B affinity for CNP. NPR-C measured as 125I-ANP binding was likewise reduced 36.4(+/-5.1)% by exposure to PMA. In contrast with NPR-B inhibition, however, inhibition of NPR-C was due largely to a reduction in the number of receptor binding sites per cell rather than a reduction in receptor affinity for ligand. The data therefore suggest that both NPR-B and NPR-C are down-regulated by PKC, but that the mechanisms of down-regulation of the two receptors are differen.
lasia (ACH) is the prototype and most common of the human chondrodysplasias. It results from gain-of-function mutations that exaggerate the signal output of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase that negatively regulates growth plate activity and linear bone growth. Several approaches to reduce FGFR3 signaling by blocking receptor activation or inhibiting downstream signals have been proposed. Five show promise in preclinical mouse studies. Two candidate therapies target the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The first is a decoy receptor that competes for activating ligands. The second is a synthetic blocking peptide that prevents ligands from binding and activating FGFR3. Two established drugs, statins and meclozine, improve growth of ACH mice. The strongest candidate therapy employs an analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which antagonizes the mitogen-activated-protein (MAP) kinase pathway downstream of the FGFR3 receptor and may also act independently in the growth plate. Only the CNP analog has reached clinical trials. Preliminary results of Phase 2 studies show a substantial increase in growth rate of ACH children after six months of therapy with no serious adverse effects. A challenge for drug therapy in ACH is targeting agents to the avascular growth plate. The application of gene therapy in osteoarthritis (OA) offers insights because it faces similar technical obstacles. Major advances in gene therapy include the emergence of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) as the vector of choice, capsid engineering to target vectors to specific tissues, and development of methods to direct vectors to articular chondrocyte.
e an exploratory clinical study, the first of its kind to our knowledge, to determine the safety and potential clinical benefit of the combination of the HIV protease inhibitors (HIV-PIs) saquinavir and ritonavir (SQV+RIT) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). This study is based on evidence that (1) HIV-PIs can improve pulmonary hemodynamics in experimental models; (2) both Toll-like receptor 4 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) participate in the pathogenesis of experimental pulmonary hypertension; and (3) a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of HMGB1-induced macrophage activation yielded HIV-PIs as potent inhibitors of HMGB1-induced cytokine production. In this proposed open-label, pre-post study, micro, low, and standard doses of SQV+RIT will be given to IPAH patients for 14 days. Patients will receive follow-up for the next 14 days. The primary outcome to be evaluated is change in HMGB1 level from baseline at 14 days. The secondary outcome is changes in tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, pulmonary arterial pressure based on echocardiography parameters and New York Heart Association/World Health Organization functional class, and Brog dyspnea scale index from baseline at 14 days. Other secondary measurements will include N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, atrial natriuretic peptide, and 6-minute walk distance. We propose that SQV+RIT treatment will improve inflammatory disorders and pulmonary hemodynamics in IPAH patients. If the data support a potentially useful therapeutic effect and suggest that SQV+RIT is safe in IPAH patients, the study will warrant further investigation.

igate the effect of peroxisiome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) on the regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and the relationship between the effect of PPAR-α with PI3K/Akt//mTOR signal pathwa.
cyte hypertrophy was induced by isoproterenol (ISO). The cell surface area was measured by image analysis system (Leica). The expressions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) and PPAR-α mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR. The protein expressions of Akt, mTOR and P70S6K were detected by Western blot. The expression of PPAR-α was suppressed by RNA.
xpression of PPAR-α was significantly reduced in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. PPAR-α activator Fenofibrate (Feno) increased the expression of PPAR-α and suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The inhibitory effect of Feno on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was reversed by PPAR-α RNAi. (2) Feno significantly inhibited the increase of the protein expressions of p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-p70S6K in ISO induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which could be blocked by PPAR-α RNAi. (3) PI3K antagonist LY294002 (LY) or mTOR antagonist rapamycin (RAPA) markedly-inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The inhibitory effects of LY or RAPA on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy were reversed by PPAR-α RNA.
n negatively regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The effect might be associated with PPAR-α inhiting PI3K/ Akt/mTOR signal pathwa.
 known whether biomarkers of hemodynamic stress, myocardial necrosis, and renal function might predict adverse outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous repair of severe mitral valve insufficiency. Thus, we aimed to assess the predictive value of various established and emerging biomarkers for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in these patient.
ur patients with symptomatic severe mitral valve insufficiency with a mean STS-Score for mortality of 12.6% and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 19.7% undergoing MitraClip therapy were prospectively included in this study. Plasma concentrations of mid regional-proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), Cystatin C, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), high-sensitive troponin T (hsTnT), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), galectin-3, and soluble ST-2 (interleukin 1 receptor-like 1) were measured directly before procedure. MACE was defined as cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure (HF.
median follow-up of 211 days (interquartile range 133 to 333 days), 9 patients (26.5%) experienced MACE (death: 7 patients, rehospitalization for HF: 2 patients). Thirty day MACE-rate was 5.9% (death: 2 patients, no rehospitalization for HF). Baseline concentrations of hsTnT (Median 92.6 vs 25.2 ng/L), NT-proBNP (Median 11251 vs 1974 pg/mL) and MR-proANP (Median 755.6 vs 318.3 pmol/L, all p&lt;0.001) were clearly higher in those experiencing an event vs event-free patients, while other clinical variables including STS-Score and logistic EuroSCORE did not differ significantly. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, NT-proBNP and in particular hsTnT and MR-proANP above the median discriminated between those experiencing an event vs event-free patients. This was further corroborated by C-statistics where areas under the ROC curve for prediction of MACE using the respective median values were 0.960 for MR-proANP, 0.907 for NT-proBNP, and 0.822 for hsTn.
 and hsTnT strongly predict cardiovascular death and rehospitalization for HF in patients undergoing percutaneous repair of mitral valve insufficiency. Both markers might be useful components in new scoring systems to better predict short- and potentially long-term mortality and morbidity after MitraClip procedur.
ted a comparative study of content proinflammatory cytokines, biomarkers of inflammatory process, biochemical indicators of congestive heart failure (CHF) and hemodynamic parameters in patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACMP) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) with various NYHA classes. We examined 62 men with ACMP (n = 45) and IHD (n = 17) and NYHA class III-IV CHF. Patients of both groups had lowered ejection fraction (EF), dilated cardiac chambers, and increased left ventricular (LV) myocardial mass index (MMI). Relative LV wall thickness was within normal limits but in the ACMP group it was significantly lower than in IHD group what corresponded to the eccentric type of myocardial hypertrophy. Higher NYHA class was associated with lower EF and larger end diastolic and end systolic LV dimensions. In ACMP it was also associated with larger dimension of the right ventricle while in IHD--with substantially larger (by 30%) dimension of atria. Substantial amount of endotoxin found in blood plasma of patients with IHD corresponded to the conception of increased intestinal permeability of in CHF. Alcohol abuse was an aggravating factor of endotoxin transmission and its concentration in patients with ACMP was 3 times higher than in patients with IHD. Patients with ACMP had substantially elevated blood concentrations of interleukins (IL) 6, 8, 12, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and its soluble receptor s-TNF-R; they also had twofold elevation of C-reactive protein concentration. ACMP was associated with manifold rise of blood content of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Patients with IHD also had elevated blood concentrations of IL 6, 8 and 12 but their values were 1.5-2 times lower than ACMP group. Blood content of TNF-α and s-TNF-R in IHD group was within normal limits. Higher NYHA class in ACMP patients was associated with higher concentrations of IL 6 and 8, TNF-a, and BNP. In both groups of patients contents of IL-12, s-TNF-R, TGF-1β and factors of acute phase of inflammation did not reflect severity of CHF. Functional insufficiency of myocardium in IHD patients was best characterized by blood content of IL-6 while in ACMP patients--of BN.
s may play an important role in identifying patients at risk for cancer therapy cardiotoxicity. Our objectives were to define the patterns of change in biomarkers with cancer therapy and their associations with cardiotoxicit.
icenter cohort of 78 breast cancer patients undergoing doxorubicin and trastuzumab therapy, 8 biomarkers were evaluated at baseline and every 3 months over a maximum follow-up of 15 months. These biomarkers, hypothesized to be mechanistically relevant to cardiotoxicity, included high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), myeloperoxidase (MPO), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1 (sFlt-1), and galectin 3 (gal-3). We determined if biomarker increases were associated with cardiotoxicity at the same visit and the subsequent visit over the entire course of therapy. Cardiotoxicity was defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Criteria; alternative definitions were also considere.
e entire cohort, all biomarkers except NT-proBNP and gal-3 demonstrated increases by 3 months; these increases persisted for GDF-15, PlGF, and hs-cTnI at 15 months. Increases in MPO, PlGF, and GDF-15 were associated with cardiotoxicity at the same visit [MPO hazard ratio 1.38 (95% CI 1.10-1.71), P = 0.02; PlGF 3.78 (1.30-11.0), P = 0.047; GDF-15 1.71 (1.15-2.55), P = 0.01] and the subsequent visit. MPO was robust to alternative outcome definition.
 in MPO are associated with cardiotoxicity over the entire course of doxorubicin and trastuzumab therapy. Assessment with PlGF and GDF-15 may also be of value. These findings motivate validation studies in additional cohort.
lasia is a human bone genetic disorder of the growth plate and is the most common form of inherited disproportionate short stature. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with essentially complete penetrance. Of these most have the same point mutation in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) which is a negative regulator of bone growth. The clinical and radiological features of achondroplasia can easily be identified; they include disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, lumbar hyperlordosis, and a trident hand configuration. The majority of achondroplasts have a normal intelligence, but many social and medical complications may compromise a full and productive life. Some of them have serious health consequences related to hydrocephalus, craniocervical junction compression, or upper-airway obstruction. In this article, we discuss a number of treatments from the surgical limb lengthening approach and the Recombinant Growth Hormone (rhGH) treatment, to future treatments, which include the Natriuretic Peptide C-type (CNP). The discussion is a comparative study of the complications and drawbacks of various experiments using numerous strategie.
f the present study was to evaluate the expression of mRNA encoding natriuretic peptides (NPs) and their receptors in the cumulus-oocyte complex in cattle, a monovular mammalian species, and also to investigate the role of NPs in oocyte meiotic resumption in vitro. mRNA was observed for the NP precursor type-A (NPPA), type-C (NPPC), NP receptor-1 (NPR-1), receptor-2 (NPR-2) and receptor-3 (NPR-3) in bovine cumulus cells, and NPR-2 mRNA was observed in oocytes. These results are different from those obtained in mouse and pig models. The effects of NPPA, NP precursor type-B (NPPB) and NPPC on the resumption of arrested meiosis maintained by forskolin were studied at three different doses (10, 100 and 1000nM) with a 12h culture system. The germinal vesicle breakdown rates were greater (P≤0.05) in oocytes that were cultured in the presence of one or a combination of NPs (from 44% to 73%) than the negative control (from 24% to 27%). Additionally, it was demonstrated that the concentration of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) is increased by NPPA and NPPC in oocytes and cumulus cells after 3h of in vitro maturation. However, in both groups, the concentration of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in the oocyte did not increase between 3 and 6h of culture, even when forskolin was used. In summary, we observed the presence of mRNA for NPs and their receptors in the bovine cumulus-oocyte complex and demonstrated that, in vitro, NPPA, NPPB and NPPC stimulate oocyte meiotic resumption in a monovular specie.
rough different receptors, natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP], brain type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and C-type natriuretic peptide [CNP]) increase intracellular cGMP, which then stimulates different pathways that activate fluid secretio.
wo-electrode voltage clamping to define the dominant pathway that is employed when natriuretic peptides activate cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Natriuretic peptides could activate CFTR by 1) cGMP cross-activation of protein kinase A (PKA), 2) cGMP activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase II, 3) cGMP inhibition of phosphodiesterase type III (PDE3), or 4) direct activation of CFT.
oinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes were perfused with diverse compounds that examined these pathways of natriuretic peptide signalin.
lated the shark CFTR (sCFTR)-mediated chloride conductance and this activation was inhibited by H-89, a specific inhibitor of PKA. After co-expression of the CNP receptor (NPR-B), sCFTR became stimulatable by CNP and was similarly inhibited by H-89, pointing to cross-activation of PKA. 8-pCPT-cGMP, a relatively cGKII-selective cGMP, failed to stimulate sCFTR. Another membrane-permeable and non-hydrolyzable analog of cGMP, 8-Br-cGMP, stimulated CFTR only at millimolar concentrations, consistent with cross-activation of PKA. The PDE inhibitors EHNA, rolipram, cilostamide, and amrinone did not significantly increase chloride conductance, arguing against a significant role for PDE2, PDE3 and PDE4 signaling in the oocyte. Sildenafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, caused a partial activation of sCFTR channels and this effect was again inhibited by H-8.
e experiments we conclude that in the Xenopus oocyte system, natriuretic peptides, 8-Br-cGMP, and PDE5 inhibitors activate CFTR by cross-activation of PK.
ed the predictive ability of selected biomarkers using N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as the benchmark and tried to establish a multi-biomarker approach to heart failure (HF) in hypertensive patients. In 120 hypertensive patients with or without overt heart failure, the incremental predictive value of the following biomarkers was investigated: Collagen III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP), cystatin C (CysC), lipocalin-2/NGAL, syndecan-4, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 receptor type I (IL1R1), galectin-3, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The highest discriminative value for HF was observed for NT-proBNP (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.873) and TGF-β (AUC=0.878). On the basis of ROC curve analysis we found that CT-1&gt;152 pg/mL, TGF-β&lt;7.7 ng/mL, syndecan&gt;2.3 ng/mL, NT-proBNP&gt;332.5 pg/mL, CysC&gt;1 mg/L and NGAL&gt;39.9 ng/mL were significant predictors of overt HF. There was only a small improvement in predictive ability of the multi-biomarker panel including the four biomarkers with the best performance in the detection of HF-NT-proBNP, TGF-β, CT-1, CysC-compared to the panel with NT-proBNP, TGF-β and CT-1 only. Biomarkers with different pathophysiological backgrounds (NT-proBNP, TGF-β, CT-1, CysC) give additive prognostic value for incident HF in hypertensive patients compared to NT-proBNP alon.
ogical histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors attenuate pathological cardiac remodeling and hypertrophic gene expression; yet, the direct histone targets remain poorly characterized. Since the inhibition of HDAC activity is associated with suppressing hypertrophy, we hypothesized histone acetylation would target genes implicated in cardiac remodeling. Trichostatin A (TSA) regulates cardiac gene expression and attenuates transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced hypertrophy. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to map, for the first time, genome-wide histone acetylation changes in a preclinical model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and attenuation of pathogenesis with TSA. Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy was associated with histone acetylation of genes implicated in cardiac contraction, collagen deposition, inflammation, and extracellular matrix identified by ChIP-seq. Gene set enrichment analysis identified NF-kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor activation with load induced hypertrophy. Increased histone acetylation was observed on the promoters of NFκB target genes (Icam1, Vcam1, Il21r, Il6ra, Ticam2, Cxcl10) consistent with gene activation in the hypertrophied heart. Surprisingly, TSA attenuated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and the suppression of NFκB target genes by broad histone deacetylation. Our results suggest a mechanism for cardioprotection subject to histone deacetylation as a previously unknown target, implicating the importance of inflammation by pharmacological HDAC inhibition. The results of this study provides a framework for HDAC inhibitor function in the heart and argues the long held views of acetylation is subject to more flexibility than previously though.
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated cardiovascular and metabolic disease. We tested the hypothesis that more than 5% body weight reduction through 6 months hypocaloric dieting alters ANP release at rest and more so during exercise in overweight or obese patient.
d-regional pro-ANP concentration was assessed at rest and after incremental exhaustive exercise testing before and after weight reduction. We also measured natriuretic peptide receptor A and C mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue to gauge both ANP responsiveness and clearance mechanism.
ge weight reduction of 9.1 ± 3.8  kg was associated with reductions in visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat mass, liver fat content, insulin resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure. However, mid-regional pro-ANP plasma concentrations were unchanged with weight loss (51 ± 24 vs. 53 ± 24  pmol/l). Exercise elicited similar acute mid-regional pro-ANP increases before and after weight loss. Adipose tissue natriuretic peptide receptor type A mRNA expression remained unchanged, whereas natriuretic peptide receptor type C mRNA decreased with weight los.
de that physical exercise acutely increases ANP release in obese patients, whereas modest diet-induced weight loss primarily affects ANP clearance mechanisms. Interventions combining weight loss and regular physical exercise may be particularly efficacious in reversing obesity-associated relative natriuretic peptide deficienc.
in II can downregulate atrial natriuretic peptide binding to rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but the mechanism is not known. Because protein kinase C (PKC) mimetic phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) can destabilize natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) mRNA and angiotensin II activates several PKC isoforms in VSMCs, we hypothesized that angiotensin II treatment decreases NPR-C mRNA stability and exerts this effect through PKC. This study demonstrated that angiotensin II induced time- and concentration-dependent downregulation of NPR-C, which was completely inhibited by an angiotensin II type I receptor blocker losartan. NPR-C mRNA disappearance rate over 6&nbsp;h was nearly doubled by exposure of VSMCs to 100&nbsp;nm angiotensin II, compared with that observed after inhibition of RNA synthesis alone. However, this response to angiotensin II was undiminished by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, or by depletion of PKC by prior exposure of cells to PMA for 48&nbsp;h. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, phospholipase C, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase also failed to reverse the angiotensin II effect. We conclude that at least two distinct proximal signaling pathways, one involved and one independent of phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C, lead to downregulation of NPR-C gene expression by destabilizing its mRN.
igate the distribution and expression of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)/natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B) in the rectum of a rodent depression model and the interventional effect of Xiaoyaosan (XYS.
 (n = 45) of clean grade (200 ± 20 g) were divided into five groups after one week of adaptive feeding: primary control, depression model, low dose XYS, middle dose XYS, and high dose XYS. The animal experiment continued for 3 wk. Primary controls were fed normally ad libitum. The rats of all other groups were raised in solitary and exposed to classic chronic mild unpredictable stimulation each day. XYS groups were perfused intragastrically with low dose, middle dose, and high dose XYS one hour before stimulation. Primary control and depression model groups were perfused intragastrically with normal saline under similar conditions as the XYS groups. Three weeks later, all rats were sacrificed, and the expression levels of CNP and NPR-B in rectum tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blottin.
PR-B were both expressed in the rectum tissues of all rats. However, the expression levels of CNP and NPR-B at both gene and protein levels in the depression model group were significantly higher when compared to the primary control group (n = 9; P &lt; 0.01). XYS intervention markedly inhibited the expression levels of CNP and NPR-B in depressed rats. The expression levels of CNP and NPR-B in the high dose XYS group did not significantly differ from the expression levels in the primary control group. Additionally, the high and middle dose XYS groups (but not the low dose group) significantly exhibited lower CNP and NPR-B expression levels in the rectum tissues of the respectively treated rats compared to the untreated depression model cohort (n = 9; P &lt; 0.01.
PR-B pathway is upregulated in the rectum of depressed rats and may be one mechanism for depression-associated digestive disorders. XYS antagonizes this pathway at least partiall.
lasia (ACH), the most common form of human dwarfism, is caused by an activating autosomal dominant mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene. Genetic overexpression of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a positive regulator of endochondral bone growth, prevents dwarfism in mouse models of ACH. However, administration of exogenous CNP is compromised by its rapid clearance in vivo through receptor-mediated and proteolytic pathways. Using in vitro approaches, we developed modified variants of human CNP, resistant to proteolytic degradation by neutral endopeptidase, that retain the ability to stimulate signaling downstream of the CNP receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor B. The variants tested in vivo demonstrated significantly longer serum half-lives than native CNP. Subcutaneous administration of one of these CNP variants (BMN 111) resulted in correction of the dwarfism phenotype in a mouse model of ACH and overgrowth of the axial and appendicular skeletons in wild-type mice without observable changes in trabecular and cortical bone architecture. Moreover, significant growth plate widening that translated into accelerated bone growth, at hemodynamically tolerable doses, was observed in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys that had received daily subcutaneous administrations of BMN 111. BMN 111 was well tolerated and represents a promising new approach for treatment of patients with AC.
 death after transient ischemic attack or stroke is more often because of heart disease or cancer than stroke. Previous studies found blood biomarkers not usefully predictive of nonfatal stroke but possibly of all-cause death. This association might be explained by potentially treatable occult cardiac disease or cancer. We therefore aimed to validate the association of a panel of biomarkers with all-cause death, particularly cardiac death and cancer death, despite the absence of associations with risk of nonfatal vascular event.
iomarkers were measured in 929 consecutive patients in a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study), recruited from 2002 and followed up to 2013. Associations were determined by Cox regression. Model discrimination was assessed by c-statistic and the integrated discrimination improvemen.
60 patient-years of follow-up, none of the biomarkers predicted risk of nonfatal vascular events. However, soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor-1, von Willebrand factor, heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were independently predictive of all-cause death (n=361; adjusted hazard ratio per SD, 95% confidence interval: heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein: 1.31, 1.12-1.56, P=0.002; N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide: 1.34, 1.11-1.62, P=0.002; soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor-1: 1.45, 1.26-1.66, P=0.02; von Willebrand factor: 1.19, 1.04-1.36, P=0.01). The independent contribution of the four biomarkers taken together added prognostic information and improved model discrimination (integrated discrimination improvement=0.028, P=0.0001). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was most predictive of vascular death (adjusted hazard ratio=1.80, 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.41, P&lt;0.0001), whereas heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein predicted cancer deaths (1.64, 1.26-2.12, P=0.0002). Associations were strongest in patients without known prior cardiac disease or cance.
iomarkers predicted death of any cause after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and heart-type fatty-acid-binding protein might improve patient selection for additional screening for occult cardiac disease or cancer, respectively. However, our results require validation in future studie.
ockers produce reverse-remodeling in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, they partially reverse changes in fetal-adult/contractile protein, natriuretic peptide, SR-Ca(2+)-ATPase gene program constituents. The objective of the current study was to further test the hypothesis that reverse-remodeling is associated with favorable changes in myocardial gene expression by measuring additional contractile, signaling, and metabolic genes that exhibit a fetal/adult expression predominance, are thyroid hormone-responsive, and are regulated by β1-adrenergic receptor signaling. A secondary objective was to identify which of these putative regulatory networks is most closely associated with observed change.
en patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.24±0.09) were randomized to the adrenergic-receptor blockers metoprolol (β1-selective), metoprolol+doxazosin (β1/α1), or carvedilol (β1/β2/α1). Serial radionuclide ventriculography and endomyocardial biopsies were performed at baseline, 3, and 12 months. Expression of 50 mRNA gene products was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Thirty-one patients achieved left ventricular ejection fraction reverse-remodeling response defined as improvement by ≥0.08 at 12 months or by ≥0.05 at 3 months (Δ left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.21±0.10). Changes in gene expression in responders versus nonresponders were decreases in NPPA and NPPB and increases in MYH6, ATP2A2, PLN, RYR2, ADRA1A, ADRB1, MYL3, PDFKM, PDHX, and CPT1B. All except PDHX involved increase in adult or decrease in fetal cardiac genes, but 100% were concordant with changes predicted by inhibition of β1-adrenergic signalin.
on to known gene expression changes, additional calcium-handling, sarcomeric, adrenergic signaling, and metabolic genes were associated with reverse-remodeling. The pattern suggests a fetal-adult paradigm but may be because of reversal of gene expression controlled by a β1-adrenergic receptor gene networ.

 the association of T190C polymorphism of β3 adrenergic receptor gene (β3-AR) with chronic heart failure (CHF), and to evaluate the effect of this polymorphism on clinical response to β-AR blockade among patients with CH.
dred and thirty patients with stable CHF receiving basic therapy for heart failure were included. Before initiation and 5 months after the maximal tolerated dose of carvedilol was reached, all indices including heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), left atrial diameter (LAD), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, 6 min walk distance were measured and compared with the indices of those with a T190C genotype. Distribution of the T190C polymorphisms in the control group and CHF group was compare.
encies of T190C genotypes of the β3-AR gene have fit with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant difference was found between the frequencies of T190C alleles and genotypes between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Compared with CC-homozygotes, TT-homozygous patients showed substantially greater improvement in LVEF and BNP (all P &lt; 0.01.
ence has been detected in the prevalence of the three genotypes between healthy and CHF subjects. The T190C variation of the β3-AR gene was not associated with increased risk for CHF. CHF patients with a T allele have greater response to carvedilol than those carrying a C allele in ethnic Han Chines.
ole (DP) restores ischemic tissue blood flow stimulating angiogenesis in eNOS-dependent pathways. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is expected to mimic the migration-stimulatory effect of NO via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. Aim of this study was to assess the role of concomitant treatment with DP on CNP levels in blood and myocardial tissue of minipigs with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) induced by pacing at 200bpm in the right ventricular apex. Minipigs with DP therapy (DP+, n=4) or placebo (DP-, n=4) and controls (C-SHAM, n=4) underwent 2D-EchoDoppler examination and blood collection before and after 4 weeks of pacing, when cardiac tissue was collected. Histological/immunohistochemical analyses were performed. CNP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay; cardiac CNP, BNP, natriuretic receptors expression by Real-Time PCR. After pacing, cardiac parameters resulted less impaired in DP+ compared to DP-. Histological sections presented normal morphology while the arteriolar density resulted: C-SHAM: 9.0±1.2; DP-: 4.9±0.3; DP+: 6.5±0.6number/mm(2); C-SHAM vs DP- and DP+ p=0.004, p=0.04, respectively. CNP mRNA resulted lower in DP- compared to C-SHAM and DP+ as well as NPR-B (p=0.011, DP- vs DP+). Both NPR-A/NPR-C mRNA expressions were significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower both in DP- and DP+ compared to C-SHAM. BNP mRNA was higher in LVD. CNP plasma levels showed a similar trend with respect to gene expression (C-SHAM: 30.5±15; DP-: 18.6±5.5; DP+: 21.2±4.7pg/ml). These data suggest that DP may serve as a preconditioning agent to increase the protective CNP-mediated endocrine response in LVD. This response, mediated by its specific receptor NPR-B, may offer new insights into molecular targets for treatment of LV.
helium plays a fundamental role in maintaining vascular homeostasis by releasing factors that regulate local blood flow, systemic blood pressure, and the reactivity of leukocytes and platelets. Accordingly, endothelial dysfunction underpins many cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Herein, we evaluated mice with endothelial-specific deletion of Nppc, which encodes C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and determined that this mediator is essential for multiple aspects of vascular regulation. Specifically, disruption of CNP leads to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, atherogenesis, and aneurysm. Moreover, we identified natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C) as the cognate receptor that primarily underlies CNP-dependent vasoprotective functions and developed small-molecule NPR-C agonists to target this pathway. Administration of NPR-C agonists promotes a vasorelaxation of isolated resistance arteries and a reduction in blood pressure in wild-type animals that is diminished in mice lacking NPR-C. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association studies that have linked the NPR-C (Npr3) locus with hypertension by demonstrating the importance of CNP/NPR-C signaling in preserving vascular homoeostasis. Furthermore, these results suggest that the CNP/NPR-C pathway has potential as a disease-modifying therapeutic target for cardiovascular disorder.
ic peptides (NPs) represent a critical pathway in heart failure (HF). However, there is wide individual variability in NP system activity, which could be partly genetic in origin. We explored genetic and nongenetic contributions to B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) inactivatio.
F patients (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;95) received recombinant human BNP (nesiritide) at standard doses, and BNP levels were measured at baseline, after 2&nbsp;hours of infusion, and 30&nbsp;minutes after discontinuation. Genomic DNA was genotyped for 91 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 2 candidate genes. We tested the association of patient characteristics and genotype with 5 pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters: elimination rate constant, ΔBNP, BNP clearance, adjusted BNP clearance, and half-life. Linear regression with pleiotropic analysis was used to test genotype associations with&nbsp;P.
nts' mean age was 63&nbsp;years, 44% were female, and 46% were African American. PK parameters varied widely, some &gt;10-fold. HF type (preserved vs reduced) was associated with PK (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.01), whereas renal function, demographics, and body mass index and were not. Two SNPs in MME (rs989692, rs6798179) and 2 in NPR3 (rs6880564, rs2062708) also had associations with PK (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05.
acokinetics of BNP varies greatly in HF patients, differs by HF type, and possibly by MME or NPR3 genotype. Additional study is warrante.
ovarian follicles, the oocyte is maintained in meiotic prophase arrest by natriuretic peptide type C (NPPC) acting via its cognate receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPR2). As there is a marked species difference in the receptor selectivity of the natriuretic peptide family, this study examined the functional effect of other natriuretic peptides, type A (NPPA) and type B (NPPB), acting via NPR2 on mouse-oocyte meiotic arrest. The results by quantitative, reverse-transcriptase PCR showed that Npr2 was the predominant natriuretic peptide receptor transcript, and that Npr1 and Npr3 mRNA levels were negligible in cumulus cells isolated from equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG)-primed, immature female mice. While NPPA and NPPB from human and rat had no effect on oocyte maturation, porcine NPPB (pNPPB) maintained oocyte meiotic arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, pNPPB-mediated meiotic arrest and cGMP production could be completely blocked by the NPR2 inhibitor sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Neither the NPR1 antagonist anantin or Npr1 knockout had an effect on pNPPB-mediated meiotic arrest. Thus, pNPPB can functionally maintain mouse-oocyte meiotic arrest by the receptor NPR2 of cumulus cells. These findings demonstrate that pNPPB may be used as a probe to identify the essential amino acid sequences for activation of NPR.
uretic peptide (NP) system is a critical physiologic pathway in heart failure with wide individual variability in functioning. We investigated the genetic component by testing the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with RNA and protein expression. Samples of DNA, RNA, and tissue from human kidney (n = 103) underwent genotyping, RT-PCR, and protein quantitation (in lysates), for four candidate genes [NP receptor 1 (NPR1), NPR2, and NPR3 and membrane metalloendopeptidase]. The association of genetic variation with expression was tested using linear regression for individual SNPs, and a principal components (PC) method for overall gene variation. Eleven SNPs in NPR2 were significantly associated with protein expression (false discovery rate ≤0.05), but not RNA quantity. RNA and protein quantity correlated poorly with each other. The PC analysis showed only NPR2 as significant. Assessment of the clinical impact of NPR2 genetic variation is neede.
nomic approaches have suggested the existence of multiple distinct subtypes of medulloblastoma. We studied a large cohort of medulloblastomas to determine how many subgroups of the disease exist, how they differ, and the extent of overlap between subgroup.
ined gene expression profiles and DNA copy number aberrations for 103 primary medulloblastomas. Bioinformatic tools were used for class discovery of medulloblastoma subgroups based on the most informative genes in the data set. Immunohistochemistry for subgroup-specific signature genes was used to determine subgroup affiliation for 294 nonoverlapping medulloblastomas on two independent tissue microarray.
unsupervised analyses of transcriptional profiles identified the following four distinct, nonoverlapping molecular variants: WNT, SHH, group C, and group D. Supervised analysis of these four subgroups revealed significant subgroup-specific demographics, histology, metastatic status, and DNA copy number aberrations. Immunohistochemistry for DKK1 (WNT), SFRP1 (SHH), NPR3 (group C), and KCNA1 (group D) could reliably and uniquely classify formalin-fixed medulloblastomas in approximately 98% of patients. Group C patients (NPR3-positive tumors) exhibited a significantly diminished progression-free and overall survival irrespective of their metastatic statu.
rative genomics approach to a large cohort of medulloblastomas has identified four disparate subgroups with distinct demographics, clinical presentation, transcriptional profiles, genetic abnormalities, and clinical outcome. Medulloblastomas can be reliably assigned to subgroups through immunohistochemistry, thereby making medulloblastoma subclassification widely available. Future research on medulloblastoma and the development of clinical trials should take into consideration these four distinct types of medulloblastom.
lastic chemotherapy can determine various side effects, including cardiotoxicity, and no real guidelines for its early detection and management have been developed. The aim of this study is to find some plasmatic markers able to identify breast cancer patients that are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications during chemotherapy, in particular heart failure. A prospective study on 100 breast cancer patients with mean age of 66&nbsp;years in adjuvant treatment with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab was performed. Patients underwent cardiological examination before starting treatment (T0) and at 3&nbsp;months (T1), 6&nbsp;months (T2), and 1&nbsp;year (T3) after treatment. Evaluation of serum cardiac markers and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was performed at T0, T1, T2, and T3, simultaneously to electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, showing a significant increase in NT-proBNP concentration (p &gt; 0.0001) at T1, T2, and T3, before left ventricular ejection fraction decrease became evident. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative patients were more susceptible to mild hematological cardiotoxicity, while HER2-positive patients were more susceptible to severe cardiotoxicity. A significant correlation between NT-proBNP increased values after chemotherapy and prediction of mortality at 1&nbsp;year was evidenced. From our experience, serum biomarker detection was able to support an early diagnosis of cardiac damage, also in the absence of left ventricular ejection fraction decrease. Therefore, the evaluation of specific plasmatic markers for cardiac damage is more sensitive than echocardiography in the early diagnosis of chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity; furthermore, it can also add a prognostic value on outcom.
ricular (LV) assist device (LVAD) support reduces pathological loading. However, load-induced adaptive responses may be suppressed. Pathological loading dysregulates cardiac G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Signaling through G proteins is deleterious, whereas beta&nbsp;(β)-arrestin-mediated signaling is cardioprotective. We examined the effects&nbsp;of&nbsp;pathological LV loading/LV dysfunction and treatment via LVAD, on β-arrestin-mediated signaling, and genetic networks downstream of loa.
myocardial infarction (MI) model was used. Sheep underwent sham thoracotomy (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3), mid-left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to produce MI (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3), or MI with placement of a small-platform catheter-based LVAD (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3). LVAD support was continued for 2&nbsp;weeks. Animals were maintained for a total of 12&nbsp;weeks. Myocardial specimens were harvested and analyze.
d β-arrestin activation. Increased interactions between epidermal growth factor receptor and β-arrestins were observed. LVAD support inhibited these responses to MI (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05). LVAD support inhibited the activation of cardioprotective signaling effectors Akt (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05), and, to a lesser extent, extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (P not significant); however, MI resulted in regional activation of load-induced GPCR signaling via G proteins, as assessed by the induction of atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA expression in the MI-adjacent zone relative to the MI-remote zone (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05). MI-adjacent zone atrial natriuretic peptide expression was renormalized with LVAD suppor.
ort inhibited cardioprotective β-arrestin-mediated signaling. However, net benefits of normalization of load-induced GPCR signaling were observed in the MI-adjacent zone. These findings may have implications for the optimal extent and duration of unloading, and for the development of adjunctive medical therapie.
f this study was to determine if the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) precursor proANP is biologically active compared with ANP and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP.
 produced in the atria and processed to ANP and activates the guanylyl cyclase receptor-A (GC-A) and its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). ProANP is found in the human circulation, but its bioavailability is undefine.
sp;vivo actions of proANP compared with ANP, BNP, and placebo were investigated in normal canines&nbsp;(667 pmol/kg, n&nbsp;= 5/group). cGMP activation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing GC-A or guanylyl cyclase receptor-B was also determined. ProANP processing and degradation were observed in serum from normal subjects (n&nbsp;= 13) and patients with heart failure (n&nbsp;= 14) ex&nbsp;viv.
d greater diuretic and natriuretic properties, with more sustained renal tubular actions, compared&nbsp;with ANP and BNP in&nbsp;vivo in normal canines, including marked renal vasodilation not observed with ANP or BNP. ProANP also resulted in greater and more prolonged cardiac unloading than ANP but much less hypotensive effects than BNP. ProANP stimulated cGMP generation by GC-A as much as ANP. ProANP was processed to ANP in serum from normal control subjects and patients with heart failure ex&nbsp;viv.
presents a novel activator of GC-A with enhanced diuretic, natriuretic, and renal vasodilating properties, and it may represent a key circulating natriuretic peptide in cardiorenal and blood pressure homeostasis. These results support the concepts that proANP may be a potential innovative therapeutic beyond ANP or BNP for cardiorenal diseases, including heart failur.
elease channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiomyocytes (ryanodine receptor type 2, RyR2) plays a critical role in the regulation of calcium and was identified as a crucial factor for development of chronic anthracycline cardiomyopathy. Its early stages are less well described although these determine the later development. Hence, we tested the effect of repeated, short-term anthracycline (daunorubicin) administration on cardiac performance, cardiomyocyte function and accompanied changes in calcium regulating proteins expression. Ten-twelve weeks old male Wistar rats were administered with 6 doses of daunorubicin (DAU, 3 mg/kg, i.p., every 48 h), controls (CON) received vehicle. Left ventricular function (left ventricular pressure, LVP; rate of pressure development, +dP/dt and decline, -dP/dt) was measured using left ventricular catheterization under tribromethanol anaesthesia (15 ml/kg b.w.). Cell shortening was measured in enzymatically isolated cardiomyocytes. The expressions of RyR2 and associated intracellular calcium regulating proteins, cytoskeletal proteins (alpha-actinin, alpha-tubul in) as well as oxidative stress regulating enzymes (gp91phox, MnSOD) were detected in ventricular tissue samples using immunoblotting. mRNA expressions of cardiac damage markers (Nppa and Nppb, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides; Myh6, Myh7 and Myh7b, myosin heavy chain alpha and beta) were detected using RT-PCR. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration was measured to estimate oxidative stress. DAU rats exhibited significantly depressed left ventricular features (LVP by 14%, +dP/dt by 36% and -dP/dt by 30%; for all P&lt;0.05), in line with concomitant increase in Nppa and Nppb gene expressions (3.23- and 2.18-fold, for both P&lt;0.05), and a 4.34-fold increase in Myh7 (P&lt;0.05). Controversially, we observed increased cell shortening of isolated cardiac cells by 31% (p&lt;0.05). DAU administration was associated with a twofold upregulation of RyR2 (P&lt;0.05), but not of other examined Ca(2+) regulating proteins remained. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in alpha-tubulin (by 46% when compared to CON P&lt;0.05). Indicators of oxidative injury were unaffected. In conclusion, unbalanced RyR2 overexpression plays a particular role in early development of daunorubicin cardiomyopathy characterized by discrepant in situ versus in vitro cardiac performanc.
tudy, the effects of postnatal overfeeding on heart energy homoeostasis and cardiac haemodynamics in adult male Swiss mice were examine.
e suckling period, the mice were divided into four groups of control or overfed pups in combination with baseline or ischaemia/reperfusion treatments (control group baseline, CGBL; overfed group baseline, OGBL; control group ischaemia/reperfusion, CGIR; and overfed group ischaemia/reperfusion, OGIR). End diastolic pressure (EDP), heart contraction speed (Max dP/dt), relaxation speed (Min dP/dt), isovolumetric relaxation time (Tau) and frequency by beats per minute (BPM) were measured. During baseline and ischaemia/reperfusion, key proteins such as AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, pAKT, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), pAMPK, insulin receptor beta (IRβ), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), fatty acid binding protein (FABP), CD36, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) were studied. The expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) was studied as a marker of cardiac hypertrophy and energetic metabolism. Cardiac fibrosis was analyzed by quantifying collagen deposition, which is increased in the OGBL and OGIR groups compared with the control group.
group showed reduced EDP compared with the CGBL group and high Max dP/dt compared with the OGBL group. Ischaemia/reperfusion increased EDP and Min dP/dt in the intragroup comparison. By contrast, Tau and frequency were not significantly different among groups. The OGIR mice showed significant alterations in heart metabolism proteins, including AKT2, pAKT/AKT1, pAKT/AKT2, AMPK, pAMPK/AMPK, PTP1B, IRS1, FABP and CD36. Furthermore, alterations in ANP, BNP, CPT1 and UCP3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression indicated hypertrophy and reduction in their efficiency, such that exclusive overnutrition in childhood induces a long-term effect on haemodynamics, metabolism and heart remodellin.
no recommendation for treating pulmonary hypertension (PH) when associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD.
te the effect of PH-specific therapy in patients with COP.
ssive patients with severe PH [mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥35 mm Hg] and COPD, who received specific PH medication and who underwent right heart catheterization at baseline and after 3-12 months of treatment, were analyzed from a prospective databas.
x patients were included with a median follow-up of 14 months. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s was 57 ± 20% of predicted, and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity was 47 ± 12%. Dyspnea was New York Health Association classification stage (NYHA) II in 15%, NYHA III in 81% and NYHA IV in 4%. First-line treatments were endothelin receptor antagonists in 11 patients, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in 11 patients, calcium blocker in 1 patient, combination therapy in 3 patients including 2 with a prostanoid. After 6 ± 3 months, pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 8.5 ± 3 to 6.6 ± 2 Wood units (p &lt; 0.001), with significant improvement of cardiac index from 2.44 ± 0.43 to 2.68 ± 0.63 liters × min × m-2 (p = 0.015) and mPAP from 48 ± 9 to 42 ± 10 mm Hg (p = 0.008). There was no significant difference in dyspnea, 6-min walking distance, echocardiographic parameters or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels. There was no significant difference in arterial oxygen saturation after 3-12 months of treatmen.
PH medications may improve hemodynamic parameters in COPD patients with severe PH. Appropriate prospective randomized studies are needed to evaluate the potential long-term clinical benefit of treatmen.
y sought to hypothesize that elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) could act as an endogenous neprilysin inhibito.
k of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is the overproduction of natriuretic peptides (NPs) by stretched cardiomyocytes. Various strategies have been developed to potentiate the beneficial effect of the NPs, including the recent use of neprilysin angiotensin receptor inhibitors. Contrary to rodents, human BNP is poorly sensitive to neprilysin degradation while retaining affinity to neprilysi.
ed 638 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute dyspnea of which 468 had ADHF and 169 had dyspnea of noncardiac origin. We also included 46 patients with stable chronic heart failure (HF) and 10 age-matched healthy subjects. Plasma samples were collected within 4 h after emergency department admission. BNP, neprilysin concentration and activity, and the neprilysin substrate substance P concentration were measure.
that when plasma BNP rose above 916 pg/ml, neprilysin activity was markedly reduced (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.0001) and stratified 95% of the population into 2 groups: BNP&nbsp;&lt;916 pg/ml/neprilysin activity&nbsp;≥ 0.21 nmol/ml/min and BNP&nbsp;≥916 pg/ml/neprilysin activity&nbsp;&lt;0.21 nmol/ml/min with very different prognoses. In&nbsp;vitro, BNP was responsible for&nbsp;neprilysin inhibition. Neprilysin activity was inversely correlated with the concentration of substance P (ρ&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.80; p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.0001.
eing an effector of the cardiac response to cardiomyocyte stretching in ADHF, elevated plasma BNP is also an endogenous neprilysin inhibitor. A biologically relevant BNP threshold discriminates 2 populations of HF patients with different vasoactive peptide profiles and outcome. If confirmed, this may identify an important threshold for managing HF patient.
issue has endocrine properties, secreting a wide range of mediators into the circulation, including factors involved in cardiovascular disease. However, little is known about the potential role of adipose tissue in heart failure (HF), and the aim of this study was to investigate epicardial (EAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue in HF patient.
tients with systolic HF and 30 patients with normal systolic function undergoing thoracic surgery were included in the study. Plasma was sampled and examined with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, whereas SAT and EAT biopsies were collected and examined by means of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and gas chromatography. Significantly higher expressions of mRNA encoding interleukin-6, adrenomedullin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, and fatty acid (FA)-binding protein 3, as well as higher levels of monounsaturated FA and palmitoleic acid, were seen in the EAT of HF patients, whereas the levels of docosahexaenoic acid were lower. Palmitoleic acid levels in EAT were correlated with 2 parameters of cardiac remodeling: increasing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptid.
ts demonstrate adipose tissue depot-specific alterations of synthesis of FA and inflammatory and metabolic mediators in systolic HF patients. EAT may be a source of increased circulatory and myocardial levels of these mediators through endocrine action.
of several mouse models imply that the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil (SIL), via increasing cGMP, affords protection against angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated cardiac remodeling. However, it is unclear which cell types are involved in these beneficial effects, because Ang II may exert its adverse effects by modulating multiple renovascular and cardiac functions via Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs). To test the hypothesis that SIL/cGMP inhibit cardiac stress provoked by amplified Ang II/AT1R directly in cardiomyocytes (CMs), we studied transgenic mice with CM-specific overexpression of the AT1R under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC-AT1R(tg/+)). The extent of cardiac growth was assessed in the absence or presence of SIL and defined by referring changes in heart weight to body weight or tibia length. Hypertrophic marker genes, extracellular matrix-regulating factors, and expression patterns of fibrosis markers were examined in αMHC-AT1R(tg/+) ventricles (with or without SIL) and corroborated by investigating different components of the natriuretic peptide/PDE5/cGMP pathway as well as cardiac functions. cGMP levels in heart lysates and intact CMs were measured by competitive immunoassays and Förster resonance energy transfer. We found higher cardiac and CM cGMP levels and upregulation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I with AT1R overexpression. However, even a prolonged SIL treatment regimen did not limit the progressive CM growth, fibrosis, or decline in cardiac functions in the αMHC-AT1R(tg/+) model, suggesting that SIL does not interfere with the pathogenic actions of amplified AT1R signaling in CMs. Hence, the cardiac/noncardiac cells involved in the cross-talk between SIL-sensitive PDE activity and Ang II/AT1R still need to be identifie.
ted endocytosis and redistribution of transmembrane receptors among membrane-bound subcellular organelles are vital for their correct signaling and physiological functions. Membrane receptors committed for internalization and trafficking pathways are sorted into coated vesicles. Cardiac hormones, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) bind to guanylyl cyclase/natriuretic peptide receptor-A (GC-A/NPRA) and elicit the generation of intracellular second messenger cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP), which lowers blood pressure and incidence of heart failure. After ligand binding, the receptor is rapidly internalized, sequestrated, and redistributed into intracellular locations. Thus, NPRA is considered a dynamic cellular macromolecule that traverses different subcellular locations through its lifetime. The utilization of pharmacologic and molecular perturbants has helped in delineating the pathways of endocytosis, trafficking, down-regulation, and degradation of membrane receptors in intact cells. This review describes the investigation of the mechanisms of internalization, trafficking, and redistribution of NPRA compared with other cell surface receptors from the plasma membrane into the cell interior. The roles of different short-signal peptide sequence motifs in the internalization and trafficking of other membrane receptors have been briefly reviewed and their potential significance in the internalization and trafficking of NPRA is discusse.
with salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) retain sodium in response to salt load and display a relative deficiency of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). LCZ696 is an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) expected to increase ANP levels while simultaneously blocking the AT1-receptor. This study investigated the effects of LCZ696 compared to valsartan on natriuresis and diuresis in Asian patients with SS.
d, double-blind, cross-over study in 72 patients with SSH (10% or higher increase in MAP when switching from 50 mmol/day to 320 mmol/day for 7 days each). Patients received LCZ696 400 mg once daily and valsartan 320 mg once daily for 4 weeks each. Natriuresis and diuresis were assessed for 6 h and 24 h after dosing on Days 1 and 2.
 LCZ696 but not valsartan resulted in significant increases from baseline in 6 h natriuresis (p &lt; 0.001) and in 24 h natriuresis (p &lt; 0.001). LCZ696 compared to valsartan demonstrated a significantly higher Day 1 natriuresis for the 6 h (adjusted treatment difference: 24.5 mmol; p &lt; 0.001) and the 24 h intervals (adjusted treatment difference: 50.3 mmol; p &lt; 0.001). On Day 28, 6 h and 24 h natriuresis were comparable to baseline and not different between treatment groups.On Day 1, LCZ696 but not valsartan resulted in significant increases from baseline in 6 h diuresis (p &lt; 0.001) and in 24 h diuresis (p &lt; 0.001). LCZ696 compared to valsartan demonstrated a significantly higher Day 1 diuresis for the 6 h (adjusted treatment difference: 291.2 mL; p &lt; 0.001) and the 24 h intervals (adjusted treatment difference: 356.4 mL; p = 0.003). On Day 28, 6 h and 24 h diuresis were comparable to baseline and not different between treatment groups.Plasma sodium and potassium levels were not different between treatment group.
 with LCZ696 400 mg compared to valsartan 320 mg once daily for 4 weeks was associated with non-sustained increases in natriuresis and diuresis. This differentiates LCZ696 from diuretics and ARBs and may suggest an added long-term benefit with respect to improved sodium balance in patients with SS.
sis is vitally important in diabetic wound healing. We had previously demonstrated that a Chinese 2-herb formula (NF3) significantly stimulated angiogenesis of HUVEC in wound healing. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In line with this, global expression profiling of NF3-treated HUVEC was performed so as to assess the regulatory role of NF3 involved in the underlying signaling pathways in wound healing angiogenesis. The microarray results illustrated that different panels of differentially expressed genes were strictly governed in NF3-treated HUVEC in a time-regulated manner. The microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and western blotting verification of NF3-treated HUVEC at 6 h revealed the involvement of various genes in diverse biological process, e.g., MAP3K14 in anti-inflammation; SLC5A8 in anti-tumorogenesis; DNAJB7 in protein translation; BIRC5, EPCAM, INSL4, MMP8 and NPR3 in cell proliferation; CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1 and MMP8 in migration; CXCR7, EPCAM and MMP8 in tubular formation; and BIRC5, CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1, MMP8 and UBD in angiogenesis. After 16 h incubation of NF3, other sets of genes were shown with differential expression in HUVEC, e.g., IL1RAPL2 and NR1H4 in anti-inflammation; miR28 in anti-tumorogenesis; GRIN1 and LCN1 in anti-oxidation; EPB41 in intracellular signal transduction; PRL and TFAP2A in cell proliferation; miR28, PRL and SCG2 in cell migration; PRL in tubular formation; and miR28, NR1H4 and PRL in angiogenesis. This study provided concrete scientific evidence in support of the regulatory role of NF3 on endothelial cells involved in wound healing angiogenesi.
atment with heart failure drugs lisinopril and spironolactone improves skeletal muscle pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse models. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone indirectly and directly target MR. The presence and function of MR in skeletal muscle have not been explored. MR mRNA and protein are present in all tested skeletal muscles from both wild-type mice and DMD mouse models. MR expression is cell autonomous in both undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes from mouse and human skeletal muscle cultures. To test for MR function in skeletal muscle, global gene expression analysis was conducted on human myotubes treated with MR agonist (aldosterone; EC50 1.3 nM) or antagonist (spironolactone; IC50 1.6 nM), and 53 gene expression differences were identified. Five differences were conserved in quadriceps muscles from dystrophic mice treated with spironolactone plus lisinopril (IC50 0.1 nM) compared with untreated controls. Genes down-regulated more than 2-fold by MR antagonism included FOS, ANKRD1, and GADD45B, with known roles in skeletal muscle, in addition to NPR3 and SERPINA3, bona fide targets of MR in other tissues. MR is a novel drug target in skeletal muscle and use of clinically safe antagonists may be beneficial for muscle diseases.-Chadwick, J. A., Hauck, J. S., Lowe, J. , Shaw, J. J., Guttridge, D. C., Gomez-Sanchez, C. E., Gomez-Sanchez, E. P., Rafael-Fortney, J. A. Mineralocorticoid receptors are present in skeletal muscle and represent a potential therapeutic targe.
tudy, we investigated molecular biomarkers, which play a role in the development of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) using gingival tissue samples through omics-based whole-genome transcriptomic while using healthy individuals as background control.
tissue biopsies from 23 patients with GAgP and 25 healthy individuals were analyzed using gene expression microarrays with network and pathway analyses to identify gene expression patterns. To substantiate the results of the microarray studies, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the mRNA expression of MZB1 and DSC1. The microarrays and qRT-PCR resulted in similar gene expression changes, confirming the reliability of our microarray results at mRNA leve.
lt of the gene expression microarray studies, 4 significant gene networks were identified. The most up-regulated genes were found as MZB1, TNFRSF17, PNOC, FCRL5, LAX1, BMS1P20, IGLL5, MMP7, SPAG4, MEI1; the most down-regulated genes were found as LOR, LAMB4, AADACL2, MAPT, ARG1, NPR3, AADAC, DSC1, LRRC4, CHP.
 of the identified genes that involved in gene networks were cellular development, cell growth and proliferation, cellular movement, cell-cell signaling and interaction, humoral immune response, protein synthesis, cell death and survival, cell population and organization, organismal injury and abnormalities, molecular transport, and small molecule biochemistry. Our data suggest new networks that have important functions as humoral immune response and organismal injury/abnormalities. Future analyses may facilitate for proteomic profiling analyses to identify gene expression patterns related to clinical outcom.
 gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective method of weight loss and remediation of type-2 diabetes; however, the mechanisms leading to these improvements are unclear. Additionally, adipocytes within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots can manifest characteristics of brown adipocytes. These 'BRITE/beige' adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are associated with improvements in glucose homeostasis and protection from obesity. Interestingly, atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides (NPs) promote BRITE/beige adipocyte enrichment of WAT depots, an effect known as &quot;browning.&quot; Here, we investigate the effect of RYGB surgery on NP, NP receptors, and browning in the gonadal adipose tissues of female mice. We propose that such changes may lead to improvements in metabolic homeostasis commonly observed following RYG.
, female, C57/Bl6 mice were fed a 60% fat diet ad libitum for six months. Mice were divided into three groups: Sham operated (SO), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and Weight matched, sham operated (WM-SO). Mice were sacrificed six weeks following surgery and evaluated for differences in body weight, glucose homeostasis, adipocyte morphology, and adipose tissue gene expressio.
calorie restriction induced similar weight loss and improved glucose metabolism without decreasing food intake. β3-adrenergic receptor expression increased in gonadal adipose tissue, in addition to Nppb (BNP), and NP receptors, Npr1, and Npr2. The ratio of Npr1:Npr3 and Npr2:Npr3 increased in RYGB, but not WM-SO groups. Ucp1 protein and mRNA, as well as additional markers of BRITE/beige adipose tissue and lipolytic genes increased in RYGB mice to a greater extent than calorie-restricted mic.
ion of Nppb, Npr1, Npr2, and β3-adrenergic receptors in gonadal adipose tissue following RYGB was associated with increased markers of browning. This browning of gonadal adipose tissue may underpin the positive effect of RYGB on metabolic parameters and may in part be mediated through upregulation of natriuretic peptide.
 glucocorticoids can induce long-term effects on offspring health, including hypertension. Programmed hypertension has been observed in a prenatal dexamethasone (DEX) exposure model. However, how renal programming responds to prenatal DEX at different stages of development and the impact of DEX on programmed hypertension remain unclear. Therefore, we utilized RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze the renal transcriptome in the offspring to examine whether key genes and pathways are responsible for DEX-induced renal programming and hypertensio.
rats received intraperitoneal dexamethasone from gestational day 16 to 22. Prenatal DEX-induced programmed hypertension was examined in male offspring at 16 weeks of ag.
DEX modified 431 renal transcripts from the nephrogenesis stage to adulthood in a constant manner. At the pre-hypertensive and established hypertension stages, we identified 11 and 13 differentially expressed genes related to blood pressure regulation, respectively. Among these genes, Npr3, Ptgs2, Agt, Edn3, Ephx2, Agtr1b, and Gucy1a3 are associated with endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing and contractile factors (EDHF and EDCF). Genes in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway may potentially be key genes contributing to programmed hypertension. In addition, DEX induced soluble epoxide hydrolase expression (Ephx2 gene encoding protein.
DEX elicits an imbalance between EDHFs and EDCFs that might lead to renal programming and hypertension. The arachidonic acid metabolism pathway is a common pathway contributing to programmed hypertension. Our results highlight candidate genes and pathways involved in renal programming as targets for therapeutic approaches to prevent programmed hypertension in children exposed to antenatal corticosteroid.
 acid (SA) is a mandatory plant metabolite in the deployment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a broad-spectrum systemic immune response induced by local inoculation with avirulent pathogens. The NPR1 transcription co-activator is the central node positively regulating SAR. SA was the last of the major hormones to be without a known receptor. Recently, NPR1 was shown to be the direct link between SA and gene activation. This discovery seems to be controversial. NPR1 being an SA-receptor is reminiscent of the mammalian steroid receptors, which are transcription factors whose binding to DNA is dependent on the interaction with a ligand. Unlike steroid receptors, NPR1 does not bind directly to DNA, but is recruited to promoters by the TGA family of transcription factors to form an enhanceosome. In Arabidopsis, NPR1 is part of a multigene family in which two other members, NPR3 and NPR4, have also been shown to interact with SA. NPR3/NPR4 are negative regulators of immunity and act as substrate adaptors for the recruitment of NPR1 to an E3-ubiquitin ligase, leading to its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In this perspective, we will stress-test in a friendly way the current NPR1/NPR3/NPR4 mode.
enols AF (BPAF) and S (BPS) are structural analogs of the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA), and are used in common products as a replacement for BPA. To elucidate genome-wide gene expression responses, estrogen-dependent osteosarcoma cells were cultured with 10 nM BPA, BPAF, or BPS, for 8 h and 3 months. Genome-wide gene expression was analyzed using the Illumina Expression BeadChip. Three months exposure had significant effects on gene expression, particularly for BPS, followed by BPAF and BPA, according to the number of differentially expressed genes (1980, 778, 60, respectively), the magnitude of changes in gene expression, and the number of enriched biological processes (800, 415, 33, respectively) and pathways (77, 52, 6, respectively). 'Embryonic skeletal system development' was the most enriched bone-related process, which was affected only by BPAF and BPS. Interestingly, all three bisphenols showed highest down-regulation of genes related to the cardiovascular system (e.g., NPPB, NPR3, TXNIP). BPA only and BPA/BPAF/BPS also affected genes related to the immune system and fetal development, respectively. For BPAF and BPS, the 'isoprenoid biosynthetic process' was enriched (up-regulated genes: HMGCS1, PDSS1, ACAT2, RCE1, DHDDS). Compared to BPA, BPAF and BPS had more effects on gene expression after long-term exposure. These findings stress the need for careful toxicological characterization of BPA analogs in the futur.
y artery disease (CAD) association study of genetic loci previously identified as being associated with blood pressure (BP) was performed in east Asian population.
le nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 9 candidate loci robustly confirmed to be associated with BP in east Asian people, were genotyped. Genotyping was done in up to 17,785 CAD case-control samples (6,522 cases and 11,263 controls). We then tested the associations with other metabolic traits (n≤17,900) and with type 2 diabetes (931 cases and 1,404 controls), and looked up the datasets in silico in other populations. Significant (adjusted P&lt;0.05) CAD associations were found for 5 BP loci: 3 new CAD associations at FIGN,FGF5 and NPR3, and 2 previously reported ones at ATP2B1 and CNNM2. The strongest CAD association was detected at ATP2B1rs2681472 (P=1.7×10(-8)), in the direction inverted to what is generally recognized for BP in the epidemiological studies.CNNM2rs12413409 showed significant association with CAD (P=8.7×10(-7)) and BMI (P=3.5×10(-8), when meta-analyzed with 75,807 east Asian people). The genetic risk score combining BP-raising alleles at each of the SNPs was positively associated with CAD (P=0.011.
tial proportion of genetic variants associated with BP were also associated with the risk of CAD in east Asian people, and there was some counter-evidence for causal inferenc.
ng responses have been attributed to both environmental and genetics factors, but the potential inducers and transducers of root waving remain elusive. Thus, the identification of novel signal elements related to root waving is an intriguing field of research. Genetic, physiological, cytological, live cell imaging, and pharmacological approaches provide strong evidence for the involvement of Arabidopsis thaliana NITRIC OXIDE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1 (AtNOA1) in salicylic acid (SA)-induced root waving. SA specially induced root waving, with an overall decrease in root elongation in A. thaliana, and this SA-induced response was disrupted in the Atnoa1 mutant, as well as in nonexpresser of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (npr1), which is defective in SA-mediated plant defense signal transduction, but not in npr3/4 single and double mutants. The expression assays revealed that the abundance of AtNOA1 was significantly increased by application of SA. Genetic and pharmacological analyses showed that SA-induced root waving involved an AtNOA1-dependent Ca(2+) signal transduction pathway, and PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) -based polar auxin transport possibly plays a crucial role in this process. Our work suggests that SA signaling through NPR1 and AtNOA1 is involved in the control of root waving, which provides new insights into the mechanisms that control root growth behavior on a hard agar surfac.
stnatal refractive development, the sclera receives retinally generated signals that regulate its biochemical properties. Hyperopic refractive error causes the retina to produce &quot;GO&quot; signals that, through the direct emmetropization pathway, cause scleral remodeling that increases the axial elongation rate of the eye, reducing the hyperopia. Myopia causes the retina to generate &quot;STOP&quot; signals that produce scleral remodeling, slowing the axial elongation rate and reducing the myopia. Our aim was to compare the pattern of gene expression produced in the sclera by the STOP signals with the GO gene expression signature we described previousl.
ne expression signature was produced by monocular -5 diopter (D) lens wear for 2 days (ML-2) or 4 days (ML-4); an additional &quot;STAY&quot; condition was examined after eyes had fully compensated for a -5 D lens after 11 days of lens wear (ML-11). After 11 days of -5 D lens wear had produced full refractive compensation, gene expression in the STOP condition was examined during recovery (without the lens) for 2 days (REC-2) or 4 days (REC-4). The untreated contralateral eyes served as a control in all groups. Two age-matched normal groups provided a comparison with the treated groups. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels for 55 candidate gene.
group compensated fully for the lens (treated eye versus control eye, -5.1±0.2 D). Wearing the lens, the hyperopic signal for elongation had dissipated (-0.3±0.3 D). In the STOP groups, the refraction in the recovering eyes became less myopic relative to the control eyes (REC-2, +1.3±0.3 D; REC-4, +2.6±0.4 D). In the STAY group, three genes showed significant downregulation. However, many genes that were significantly altered in GO showed smaller, nonsignificant, expression differences in the same direction in STAY, suggesting the gene expression signature in STAY is a greatly weakened form of the GO signature. In the STOP groups, a different gene expression pattern was observed, characterized by mostly upregulation with larger fold differences after 4 days than after 2 days of recovery. Eleven of the 55 genes examined showed significant bidirectional GO/STOP regulation in the ML-2 and REC-2 groups, and 13 genes showed bidirectional regulation in the ML-4 and REC-4 groups. Eight of these genes (NPR3, CAPNS1, NGEF, TGFB1, CTGF, NOV, TIMP1, and HS6ST1) were bidirectionally regulated at both time points in the GO and STOP conditions. An additional 15 genes showed significant regulation in either GO or STOP conditions but not in bot.
s are involved in scleral remodeling and the control of axial length. The STOP (recovery) gene expression signature in the sclera involves some of the same genes, bidirectionally regulated, as the GO signature. However, other genes, regulated in GO, are not differentially regulated in STOP, and others show differential regulation only in STO.
hormone salicylic acid (SA) is a small phenolic compound that regulates diverse physiological processes, in particular plant resistance against pathogens. Understanding SA-mediated signaling has been a major focus of plant research. Pathogen-induced SA is mainly synthesized via the isochorismate pathway in chloroplasts, with ICS1 (ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1) being a critical enzyme. Calcium signaling regulates activities of a subset of transcription factors thereby activating nuclear ICS1 expression. The produced SA triggers extensive transcriptional reprogramming in which NPR1 (NON-EXPRESSOR of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1) functions as the central coactivator of TGA transcription factors. Recently, two alternative but not exclusive models for SA perception mechanisms were proposed. The first model is that NPR1 homologs, NPR3 and NPR4, perceive SA thereby regulating NPR1 protein accumulation. The second model describes that NPR1 itself perceives SA, triggering an NPR1 conformational change thereby activating SA-mediated transcription. Besides the direct SA binding, NPR1 is also regulated by SA-mediated redox changes and phosphorylation. Emerging evidence show that pathogen virulence effectors target SA signaling, further strengthening the importance of SA-mediated immunit.
t be capable of switching between growth and autophagy in unpredictable nutrient environments. The conserved Npr2 protein complex (comprising Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3; also called SEACIT) inhibits target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) kinase signaling, which inhibits autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions. In yeast cultured in media with nutrient limitations that promote autophagy and inhibit growth, loss of Npr2 enables cells to bypass autophagy and proliferate. We determined that Npr2-deficient yeast had a metabolic state distinct from that of wild-type yeast when grown in minimal media containing ammonium as a nitrogen source and a nonfermentable carbon source (lactate). Unlike wild-type yeast, which accumulated glutamine, Npr2-deficient yeast metabolized glutamine into nitrogen-containing metabolites and maintained a high concentration of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). Moreover, in wild-type yeast grown in these nutrient-limited conditions, supplementation with methionine stimulated glutamine consumption for synthesis of nitrogenous metabolites, demonstrating integration of a sulfur-containing amino acid cue and nitrogen utilization. These data revealed the metabolic basis by which the Npr2 complex regulates cellular homeostasis and demonstrated a key function for TORC1 in regulating the synthesis and utilization of glutamine as a nitrogen sourc.
 acid (SA) is a key plant hormone that mediates host responses against microbial pathogens. Identification and characterization of SA-interacting/binding proteins is a topic which has always excited scientists studying microbial defense response in plants. It is likely that discovery of a true receptor for SA may greatly advance understanding of this important signaling pathway. SABP2 with its high affinity for SA was previously considered to be a SA receptor. Despite a great deal work we may still not have true a receptor for SA. It is also entirely possible that there may be more than one receptor for SA. This scenario is more likely given the diverse role of SA in various physiological processes in plants including, modulation of opening and closing of stomatal aperture, flowering, seedling germination, thermotolerance, photosynthesis, and drought tolerance. Recent identification of NPR3, NPR4 and NPR1 as potential SA receptors and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDHE2), several glutathione S transferases (GSTF) such as SA binding proteins have generated more interest in this field. Some of these SA binding proteins may have direct/indirect role in plant processes other than pathogen defense signaling. Development and use of new techniques with higher specificity to identify SA-interacting proteins have shown great promise and have resulted in the identification of several new SA interactors. This review focuses on SA interaction/binding proteins identified so far and their likely role in mediating plant defense.
rial agent of citrus canker disease (Xanthomonas citri ssp. citri, Xcc) has caused tremendous economic losses to the citrus industry around the world. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) is important to plant immunity. In this study, we compared the defence responses of citrus canker-resistant and citrus canker-susceptible genotypes to the Xcc-derived PAMP flg22 (Xflg22) by analysing the expression of 20 citrus defence-associated genes. We showed that, in the most resistant genotype, 'Nagami' kumquat, there was significant induction of several defence genes (EDS1, NDR1, PBS1, RAR1, SGT1, PAL1, NPR2 and NPR3) as early as 6 h and up to 72 h after Xflg22 treatment. At the other end of the spectrum, highly susceptible 'Duncan' grapefruit showed no induction of the same defence genes, even 120 h after treatment. Citrus genotypes with partial levels of resistance showed intermediate levels of transcriptional reprogramming that correlated with their resistance level. Xflg22 also triggered a rapid oxidative burst in all genotypes which was higher and accompanied by the induction of PTI marker genes (WRKY22 and GST1) only in the more resistant genotypes. Pretreatment with Xflg22 prior to Xcc inoculation inhibited bacterial growth in kumquat, but not in grapefruit. A flagellin-deficient Xcc strain (XccΔfliC) showed greater growth increase relative to wild-type Xcc in kumquat than in grapefruit. Taken together, our results indicate that Xflg22 initiates strong PTI in canker-resistant genotypes, but not in susceptible ones, and that a robust induction of PTI is an important component of citrus resistance to canke.
 is an intracellular degradation process that delivers cytosolic material to lysosomes and vacuoles. To investigate the mechanisms that regulate autophagy, we performed a genome-wide screen using a yeast deletion-mutant collection, and found that Npr2 and Npr3 mutants were defective in autophagy. Their mammalian homologs, NPRL2 and NPRL3, were also involved in regulation of autophagy. Npr2-Npr3 function upstream of Gtr1-Gtr2, homologs of the mammalian RRAG GTPase complex, which is crucial for TORC1 regulation. Both npr2∆ mutants and a GTP-bound Gtr1 mutant suppressed autophagy and increased Tor1 vacuole localization. Furthermore, Gtr2 binds to the TORC1 subunit Kog1. A GDP-bound Gtr1 mutant induced autophagy even under nutrient-rich conditions, and this effect was dependent on the direct binding of Gtr2 to Kog1. These results revealed that 2 molecular mechanisms, Npr2-Npr3-dependent GTP hydrolysis of Gtr1 and direct binding of Gtr2 to Kog1, are involved in TORC1 inactivation and autophagic inductio.
n inhibitors prevent the breakdown of bradykinin and natriuretic peptides, promoting vasodilation and natriuresis. However, they also increase angiotensin II and endothelin-1. Here we studied the effects of a low and a high dose of the neprilysin inhibitor thiorphan on top of AT1 receptor blockade with irbesartan versus vehicle in TGR(mREN2)27 rats with high renin hypertension. Mean arterial blood pressure was unaffected by vehicle or thiorphan alone. Irbesartan lowered blood pressure, but after 7 days pressure started to increase again. Low- but not high-dose thiorphan prevented this rise. Only during exposure to low-dose thiorphan plus irbesartan did heart weight/body weight ratio, cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide expression, and myocyte size decrease significantly. Circulating endothelin-1 was not affected by low-dose thiorphan with or without irbesartan, but increased after treatment with high-dose thiorphan plus irbesartan. This endothelin-1 rise was accompanied by an increase in renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 protein abundance, and an upregulation of constrictor vascular endothelin type B receptors. Consequently, the endothelin type B receptor antagonist BQ788 no longer enhanced endothelin-1-induced vasoconstriction (indicative of endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation), but prevented it. Thus, optimal neprilysin inhibitor dosing reveals additional cardioprotective effects on top of AT1 receptor blockade in renin-dependent hypertensio.
n is a membrane-bound enzyme that breaks down natriuretic peptides. The PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial showed that patients with heart failure (HF) treated with an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor lived longer without being hospitalized for HF than those receiving standard care with enalapri.
y sought to assess the presence of circulating soluble neprilysin in a real-life cohort of HF patients and correlate neprilysin levels with outcome.
ng soluble neprilysin was measured with a modified sandwich immunoassay in consecutive ambulatory patients with HF who were followed up for 4.1 years. Associations between neprilysin level and a composite endpoint that included cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization were explore.
prilysin concentration in 1,069 patients was 0.642 ng/ml (median quartile 1 to 3: 0.385 to 1.219). Neprilysin weakly but significantly correlated with age (rho&nbsp;= 0.16; p&nbsp;&lt; 0.001). In age-adjusted Cox regression analyses, neprilysin concentrations were significantly associated with the composite endpoint (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.29; p&nbsp;= 0.001) and cardiovascular death (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.32; p&nbsp;= 0.002). In comprehensive multivariable analyses, soluble neprilysin remained significantly associated with both the composite endpoint (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.31; p&nbsp;= 0.001) and cardiovascular death (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.32; p&nbsp;= 0.006.
ation of circulating neprilysin in HF patients and the positive association of neprilysin with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity further support the importance of NEP inhibition for augmenting natriuretic peptides as a therapeutic targe.
igate the effects of Xuebijing injection on hemodynamics, cardiac function, and endothelial function in patients with severe sepsis in order to study the therapeutic effect of Xuebijing in the treatment of severe sepsi.
tive randomized controlled trial was conducted. Sixty-six severe sepsis patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Guangdong Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from March 2013 to February 2014 were enrolled. The patients were divided into control group (n = 31) and Xuebijing group (n = 35). The patients in both groups were treated according to &quot;2012 international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock&quot;, and the patients in Xuebijing group received Xuebijing injection of 50 mL(added with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection) twice a day for 5 days, and those in control group received instead 150 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection for 5 days. The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and dosage of vasoactive drugs before and 1 day and 5 days after treatment were determined for hemodynamics assessment. Blood lactic acid (Lac), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), and difference in arterial-venous blood carbon dioxide pressure (Pv-aCO2) were determined for microcirculation assessment. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output (CO), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), the ratio of blood flow of mitral orifice between rapid filling period and atrial systole period (E/A), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) were determined for cardiac function assessment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble receptor (sFLT-1) were assessed for endothelial function assessment. The relationship among the indexes of the hemodynamics, microcirculation, cardiac function, and endothelial function was analyzed with Pearson related-analysi.
atment, HR, MAP, CVP, Lac, ScvO2, and Pv-aCO2 were improved in both groups compared with those before treatment, and the dosage of norepinephrine (NE) was decreased in Xuebijing group. Compared with control group, MAP at 5 days after treatment in Xuebijing group was significantly increased [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 74.9±10.7 vs. 70.2±6.6, P &lt; 0.05], the dosage of NE was decreased [μg×kg-1×min-1: 0.01 (0.00, 0.22) vs. 0.10 (0.05, 0.80), P &lt; 0.05], LVEF was significantly increased (0.617±0.125 vs. 0.533±0.129, P &lt; 0.05), BNP was significantly decreased [ng/L: 117.3 (52.0, 443.0) vs. 277.2 (67.9, 2 370.2), P &lt; 0.05], while VEGF showed no significant change (ng/L: 101.1±23.2 vs. 89.6±20.5, P &gt; 0.05), and sFLT-1 was significantly decreased (ng/L: 245.7±86.2 vs. 295.1±95.1, P &lt; 0.05). It was shown by Pearson coefficient bivariate correlation analysis that sFLT-1 was negatively correlated with MAP and ScvO2 (r = -0.569, P = 0.000; r = -0.341, P = 0.008) 5 days after treatment, while it was positively associated with Lac and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (r = 0.749, P = 0.000; r = 0.645, P = 0.000.

-AHF (Biased Ligand of the Angiotensin Receptor Study in Acute Heart Failure) study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of TRV027, a novel biased ligand of the angiotensin-2 type 1 receptor, in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). AHF remains a major public health problem, and no currently-available therapies have been shown to&nbsp;favorably affect outcomes. TRV027 is a novel biased ligand of the angiotensin-2 type 1 receptor that antagonizes angiotensin-stimulated G-protein activation while stimulating β-arrestin. In animal models, these effects reduce afterload while increasing cardiac performance and maintaining stroke volume. In initial human studies, TRV027 appears to be hemodynamically active primarily in patients with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a potentially attractive profile for an AHF therapeutic. BLAST-AHF is an international prospective, randomized, phase IIb, dose-ranging study that will randomize up to 500 AHF patients with systolic blood pressure&nbsp;≥120 mm Hg and&nbsp;≤200 mm&nbsp;Hg within 24 h of initial presentation to 1 of 3 doses of intravenous TRV027 (1, 5, or 25 mg/h) or matching placebo (1:1:1:1) for at least 48 h and up to 96 h. The primary endpoint is a composite of 5 clinical endpoints (dyspnea, worsening heart failure, length of hospital stay, 30-day rehospitalization, and 30-day mortality) combined using an average z-score. Secondary endpoints will include the assessment of dyspnea and change in amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. The BLAST-AHF study will assess the efficacy and safety of a novel biased ligand of the&nbsp;angiotensin-2 type 1 receptor in AH.
failure (HF) alveolar-capillary membrane is abnormal. Surfactant-derived proteins (SPs) and plasma receptor for advanced-glycation-end-products (RAGE) have been proposed as lung damage marker.
ne chronic HF and 17 healthy subjects were evaluated by echocardiography, blood parameters, carbon monoxide lung diffusion (DLCO) and cardiopulmonary exercise test. We measured immature SP-B, mature SP-B, SP-A, SP-D and RAGE plasma level.
SP-B (arbitrary units), mature SP-A (ng/ml) and SP-D (ng/ml), but not mature SP-B (ng/ml) and RAGE (pg/ml) levels, were higher in HF than in controls [immature SP-B: 15.6 (13.1, 75th-25th interquartile range) Vs. 11.1 (6.4), p&lt;0.01; SP-A, 29.6 (20.1) Vs. 18.3 (13.5), p = 0.01; SP-D: 125 (90) Vs. 78 (58), p&lt;0.01]. Immature SP-B, SP-A, SP-D and RAGE values were related to DLCO, peak oxygen consumption, ventilatory efficiency, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), whereas plasma mature SP-B was not. The DLCO Vs. immature SP-B correlation was the strongest one. At multivariate analysis, RAGE was associated to age and creatinine, SP-A to DLCO and BNP, SP-D to BNP, mature SP-B to DLCO and creatinine, and immature SP-B only but strongly to DLC.
SP-B is the most reliable biological marker of alveolar-capillary membrane function in H.
ession of BAALC (brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic) predicts an inferior outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. To identify BAALC-associated genes that give insights into its functional role in chemotherapy resistance, gene expression signatures differentiating high from low BAALC expressers were generated from normal CD34(+) progenitors, T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and AML samples. The insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) was one of the four genes (CD34, CD133, natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR3), IGFBP7) coexpressed with BAALC and common to the three entities. In T-ALL, high IGFBP7-expression was associated with an immature phenotype of early T-ALL (P&lt;0.001), expression of CD34 (P&lt;0.001) and CD33 (P&lt;0.001). Moreover, high IGFBP7-expression predicted primary therapy resistance (P=0.03) and inferior survival in T-ALL (P=0.03). In vitro studies revealed that IGFBP7 protein significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cell lines (Jurkat cells: 42% reduction, P=0.002; KG1a cells: 65% reduction, P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, IGFBP7 was identified as a BAALC coexpressed gene. Furthermore, high IGFBP7 was associated with stem cell features and treatment failure in T-ALL. In contrast to BAALC, which likely represents only a surrogate marker of treatment failure in acute leukemia, IGFBP7 regulates the proliferation of leukemic cells and might be involved in chemotherapy resistanc.
tuitary, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) has been implicated as a gonadotroph-specific factor, yet expression of the CNP gene (Nppc) and CNP activity in gonadotrophs is poorly defined. Here, we examine the molecular expression and putative function of a local gonadotroph natriuretic peptide system. Nppc, along with all three natriuretic peptide receptors (Npr1, Npr2 and Npr3), was expressed in both alphaT3-1 and LbetaT2 cells and primary mouse pituitary tissue, yet the genes for atrial-(ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptides (Nppa and Nppb) were much less abundant. Putative processing enzymes of CNP were also expressed in alphaT3-1 cells and primary mouse pituitaries. Transcriptional analyses revealed that the proximal 50 bp of the murine Nppc promoter were sufficient for GNRH responsiveness, in an apparent protein kinase C and calcium-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed Sp1/Sp3 proteins form major complexes within this region of the Nppc promoter. CNP protein was detectable in rat anterior pituitaries, and electron microscopy detected CNP immunoreactivity in secretory granules of gonadotroph cells. Pharmacological analyses of natriuretic peptide receptor activity clearly showed ANP and CNP are potent activators of cGMP production. However, functional studies failed to reveal a role for CNP in regulating cell proliferation or LH secretion. Surprisingly, CNP potently stimulated the human glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit promoter in LbetaT2 cells but not in alphaT3-1 cells. Collectively, these findings support a role for CNP as the major natriuretic peptide of the anterior pituitary, and for gonadotroph cells as the major source of CNP expression and site of actio.
 endochondral bones is regulated through the activity of cartilaginous growth plates. Disruption of the physiological patterns of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation--such as in endocrine disorders or in many different genetic diseases (e.g. chondrodysplasias)--generally results in dwarfism and skeletal defects. For example, glucocorticoid administration in children inhibits endochondral bone growth, but the molecular targets of these hormones in chondrocytes remain largely unknown. In contrast, recent studies have shown that C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) is an important anabolic regulator of cartilage growth, and loss-of-function mutations in the human CNP receptor gene cause dwarfism. We asked whether glucocorticoids could exert their activities by interfering with the expression of CNP or its downstream signaling component.
ouse chondrocytes in monolayer where incubated with the synthetic glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (DEX) for 12 to 72 hours. Cell numbers were determined by counting, and real-time PCR was performed to examine regulation of genes in the CNP signaling pathway by DE.
hat DEX does influence expression of key genes in the CNP pathway. Most importantly, DEX significantly increases RNA expression of the gene encoding CNP itself (Nppc). In addition, DEX stimulates expression of Prkg2 (encoding cGMP-dependent protein kinase II) and Npr3 (natriuretic peptide decoy receptor) genes. Conversely, DEX was found to down-regulate the expression of the gene encoding its receptor, Nr3c1 (glucocorticoid receptor), as well as the Npr2 gene (encoding the CNP receptor.
suggest that the growth-suppressive activities of DEX are not due to blockade of CNP signaling. This study reveals a novel, unanticipated relationship between glucocorticoid and CNP signaling and provides the first evidence that CNP expression in chondrocytes is regulated by endocrine factor.
ic peptides are a family of structurally related but genetically distinct hormones/paracrine factors that regulate blood volume, blood pressure, ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, fat metabolism, and long bone growth. The mammalian members are atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide, and possibly osteocrin/musclin. Three single membrane-spanning natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) have been identified. Two, NPR-A/GC-A/NPR1 and NPR-B/GC-B/NPR2, are transmembrane guanylyl cyclases, enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of cGMP. One, NPR-C/NPR3, lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity and controls the local concentrations of natriuretic peptides through constitutive receptor-mediated internalization and degradation. Single allele-inactivating mutations in the promoter of human NPR-A are associated with hypertension and heart failure, whereas homozygous inactivating mutations in human NPR-B cause a form of short-limbed dwarfism known as acromesomelic dysplasia type Maroteaux. The physiological effects of natriuretic peptides are elicited through three classes of cGMP binding proteins: cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. In this comprehensive review, the structure, function, regulation, and biological consequences of natriuretic peptides and their associated signaling proteins are describe.
vances in genome analysis have enabled the identification of numerous distal enhancers that regulate gene expression in various conditions. However, the enhancers involved in pathological conditions are largely unknown because of the lack of in vivo quantitative assessment of enhancer activity in live animals. Here, we established a noninvasive and quantitative live imaging system for monitoring transcriptional activity and identified a novel stress-responsive enhancer of Nppa and Nppb, the most common markers of heart failure. The enhancer is a 650-bp fragment within 50 kb of the Nppa and Nppb loci. A chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay revealed that this distal enhancer directly interacts with the 5'-flanking regions of Nppa and Nppb. To monitor the enhancer activity in a live heart, we established an imaging system using the firefly luciferase reporter. Using this imaging system, we observed that the novel enhancer activated the reporter gene in pressure overload-induced failing hearts (failing hearts: 5.7±1.3-fold; sham-surgery hearts: 1.0±0.2-fold; P&lt;0.001, repeated-measures ANOVA). This method will be particularly useful for identifying enhancers that function only during pathological condition.
ic SLP (sustained ligand-activated preconditioning) induced by 3-5 days of opioid receptor (OR) agonism induces persistent protection against ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury in young and aged hearts, and is mechanistically distinct from conventional preconditioning responses. We thus applied unbiased gene-array interrogation to identify molecular effects of SLP in pre- and post-ischemic myocardiu.
l/6 mice were implanted with 75 mg morphine or placebo pellets for 5 days. Resultant SLP did not modify cardiac function, and markedly reduced dysfunction and injury in perfused hearts subjected to 25 min ischemia/45 min reperfusion. Microarray analysis identified 14 up- and 86 down-regulated genes in normoxic hearts from SLP mice (≥1.3-fold change, FDR≤5%). Induced genes encoded sarcomeric/contractile proteins (Myh7, Mybpc3,Myom2,Des), natriuretic peptides (Nppa,Nppb) and stress-signaling elements (Csda,Ptgds). Highly repressed genes primarily encoded chemokines (Ccl2,Ccl4,Ccl7,Ccl9,Ccl13,Ccl3l3,Cxcl3), cytokines (Il1b,Il6,Tnf) and other proteins involved in inflammation/immunity (C3,Cd74,Cd83, Cd86,Hla-dbq1,Hla-drb1,Saa1,Selp,Serpina3), together with endoplasmic stress proteins (known: Dnajb1,Herpud1,Socs3; putative: Il6, Gadd45g,Rcan1) and transcriptional controllers (Egr2,Egr3, Fos,Hmox1,Nfkbid). Biological themes modified thus related to inflammation/immunity, together with cellular/cardiovascular movement and development. SLP also modified the transcriptional response to I-R (46 genes uniquely altered post-ischemia), which may influence later infarction/remodeling. This included up-regulated determinants of cellular resistance to oxidant (Mgst3,Gstm1,Gstm2) and other forms of stress (Xirp1,Ankrd1,Clu), and repression of stress-response genes (Hspa1a,Hspd1,Hsp90aa,Hsph1,Serpinh1) and Txni.
n via SLP is associated with transcriptional repression of inflammation/immunity, up-regulation of sarcomeric elements and natriuretic peptides, and modulation of cell stress, growth and development, while conventional protective molecules are unaltere.
siderable effort has been made to investigate the neural mechanisms of pain, much less effort has been devoted to itch, at least until recently. However, itch is now gaining increasing recognition as a widespread and costly medical and socioeconomic issue. This is accompanied by increasing interest in the underlying neural mechanisms of itch, which has become a vibrant and rapidly-advancing field of research. The goal of the present forefront review is to describe the recent progress that has been made in our understanding of itch mechanism.
- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase Sgk1 contributes to cardiac remodeling and development of heart failure, which is paralelled by Sgk1-dependent stimulation of the cardiac Na(+)/H(+) exchanger Nhe1. Glucocorticoids are powerful stimulators of Sgk1 expression and influence cardiac remodeling. The present study thus explored whether the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone influenced cardiac Sgk1 expression, as well as activity, expression and phosphorylation at Ser(703) of the cardiac Na(+)/H(+) exchanger Nhe.
ts were performed in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and gene targeted mice lacking functional Sgk1 (sgk1(-/-)) and respective wild type mice (sgk1(+/+)). Gene expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and Nhe1 phosphorylation was determined utilizing a specific antibody against a 14-3-3 binding motif at P-Ser(703), which represents a putative phosphorylation site recognition motif for Sgk1 and is involved in Nhe1 activation. Cytosolic pH (pHi) was determined utilizing 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) fluorescence and Nhe activity by the Na(+)-dependent realkalinization after an ammonium puls.
 of HL-1 cardiomyocytes with dexamethasone was followed by a significant increase in Sgk1 mRNA expression, parallelled by increased Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activity. Furthermore, dexamethasone significantly increased Nhe1 and Spp1 mRNA expression. The effects of dexamethasone were blunted by cotreatment of HL-1 cardiomyocytes with the Sgk1 inhibitor EMD638683. Cotreatment with Nhe1 inhibitor cariporide similarly prevented dexamethasone-stimulated Spp1 mRNA expression. In sgk1(+/+) mice, dexamethasone significantly increased cardiac Sgk1 mRNA levels. In sgk1(+/+) mice, but not in sgk1(-/-) mice, dexamethasone significantly increased cardiac Nhe1 mRNA expression and Nhe1 phosphorylation at Ser(703). Furthermore, cardiac Spp1, Ctgf, Nppa and Nppb mRNA levels were significantly increased in dexamethasone treated sgk1(+/+) mice, effects significantly blunted in sgk1(-/-) mic.
ritically involved in the phosphorylation and activation of the cardiac Na(+)/H(+) exchanger Nhe.
tudy, the interaction of natriuretic peptides (NP) and bradykinin (BK) signaling pathways was identified by measuring membrane potential (V(m)) and intracellular Ca(2+) using the patch-clamp technique and flow cytometry in HEK-293 cells. BK and NP receptor mRNA was identified using RT-PCR. BK (100 nM) depolarized cells activating bradykinin receptor type 2 (B(2)R) and Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channels inhibitable by 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB; 10 μM). The BK-induced Ca(2+) signal was blocked by the B(2)R inhibitor HOE 140. [Des-Arg(9)]-bradykinin, an activator of B(1)R, had no effect on intracellular Ca(2+). NP [atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and urodilatin] depolarized HEK-293 cells inhibiting K(+) channels. ANP, urodilatin, BNP [binding to natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A] and 8-bromo-(8-Br)-cGMP inhibited the BK-induced depolarization while CNP (binding to NPR-Bi) failed to do so. The inhibitory effect on BK-triggered depolarization could be reversed by blocking PKG using the specific inhibitor KT 5823. BK-stimulated depolarization as well as Ca(2+) signaling was completely blocked by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 (10 nM). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB; 50 μM) completely inhibited the BK-induced Ca(2+) signaling. UTP, another activator of the PLC-mediated Ca(2+) signaling pathway, was blocked by U-73122 as well but not by 8-Br-cGMP, indicating an intermediate regulatory step for NP via PKG in BK signaling such as regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins. When RGS proteins were inhibited by CCG-63802 in the presence of BK and 8-Br-cGMP, cells started to depolarize again. In conclusion, as natural antagonists of the B(2)R signaling pathway, NP may also positively interact in pathological conditions caused by B.
th chronic systemic-to-pulmonary shunting in growing piglets has been reported as an early pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) model with preserved right ventricular (RV) function. We sought to determine whether prolonged shunting might be associated with more severe PAH and RV failur.
growing piglets were randomized to a sham operation or the anastomosis of the left innominate artery to the pulmonary arterial trunk. Six months later, the shunt was closed and the animals underwent haemodynamic evaluation followed by tissue sampling for pathobiological assessment. Prolonged shunting had resulted in increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (22 ± 2 versus 17 ± 1 mmHg) and pulmonary arteriolar medial thickness, while cardiac output was decreased. However, RV-arterial coupling was markedly deteriorated, with a ~50% decrease in the ratio of end-systolic to pulmonary arterial elastances (Ees/Ea). Lung tissue expressions of endothelin-1, angiopoietin-1, and bone morphogenetic protein receptor-2 were similarly altered compared with previously observed after 3-month shunting. At the RV tissue level, pro-apoptotic ratio of Bax-to-Bcl-2 expressions and caspase-3 activation were increased, along with an increase in cardiomyocyte size, while expressions in voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1.5 and Kv2.1) and angiogenic factors (angiopoietin-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor) were decreased. Right ventricular expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] and natriuretic peptide precursors (NPPA and NPPB) were increased. There was an inverse correlation between RV Ees/Ea and pro-apoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.
 left-to-right shunting in piglets does not further aggravate pulmonary vasculopathy, but is a cause of RV failure, which appears related to an activation of apoptosis and inflammatio.
in the homeostasis of stem cells and prevent their ability to initiate tumorigenesis, it is important to identify and modify factors that prevent or accelerate stem cell senescence. We used microarrays to attempt to identify such factors in human amniotic fluid (HAF)-derived stem cell.
fy gene expression changes over a time course, we compared gene expression profiles of HAF-derived stem cells in different passages (1(st), 2(nd), 4(th), 6(th), 8(th), and 10(th)) using a Sentrix Human illumina microarra.
,804 genes in the microarray chip, 1,970 showed an over 2-fold change relative to the control (the 1(st) passage)-either upregulated or downregulated. Quantitative real-time PCR validated the microarray data for selected genes: markedly increased genes were CXCL12, cadherin 6 (CDH6), and folate receptor 3 (FOLR3). Downregulated genes included cyclin D2, keratin 8, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), natriuretic peptide precursor B (NPPB) and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2). The expression pattern of the selected genes was consistent with the microarray data except for CXCL12 and IGF2. Interestingly, the expression of NPPB was dramatically downregulated along the time course; it was almost completely shut-down by the 10(th) passage. In contrast, FOLR3 mRNA expression was dramatically increase.
ether, although a function for NPPB and FOLR3 in stem cell senescence has not been reported, our results strongly suggest that NPPB and/or FOLR3 play a significant role in the regulation of stem cell senescenc.
reatment with suprapharmacologic doses of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists has a known potential for causing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The mechanism by which LVH develops is not well understood nor are biomarkers of it well characterized. Natriuretic peptides are important regulators of cardiac growth, blood volume, and arterial pressure and may be useful biomarkers of LVH and hemodynamic changes that precede it. We measured amino-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NTproANP), amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations in serum and plasma, as well as transcripts in left ventricular heart tissue for atrial natriuretic peptide precursor (Nppa), brain natriuretic peptide precursor (Nppb), and myosin heavy chain-beta (Myh7) as potential biomarkers of LVH induced by a PPARalpha/gamma dual agonist in Sprague-Dawley rats. We used magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and hemodynamics to identify structural and functional cardiovascular changes related to the biomarkers. Heart-to-brain weight ratios (HW:BrW) were correlated with NTproANP, NTproBNP, and cTnI concentrations in serum as well as fold change in expression of Nppa and Nppb. LVH was characterized by increased left ventricular wall thickness and inner diameter, increased cardiac output, decreased arterial blood pressure, and increased heart rate. In these studies, each end point contributed to the early detection of LVH, the ability to monitor its progression, and demonstrated the ability of NTproANP concentration in serum to predict LVH and hemodynamic change.
y examined the functional role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)-mediated cardioprotection in mice with targeted disruption of the sEH or Ephx2 gene (sEH null.
mouse hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to global no-flow ischaemia followed by reperfusion. Hearts were analysed for recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), mRNA levels, and protein expression. Naïve hearts from sEH null mice had similar expression of preproBNP (Nppb) mRNA compared with wild-type (WT) hearts. However, significant increases in Nppb mRNA and BNP protein expression occurred during post-ischaemic reperfusion and correlated with improved post-ischaemic recovery of LVDP. Perfusion with the putative EET receptor antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid prior to ischaemia reduced the preproBNP mRNA in sEH null hearts. Inhibitor studies demonstrated that perfusion with the natriuretic peptide receptor type-A (NPR-A) antagonist, A71915, limited the improved recovery in recombinant full-length mouse BNP (rBNP)- and 11,12-EET-perfused hearts as well as in sEH null mice. Increased expression of phosphorylated protein kinase C epsilon and Akt were found in WT hearts perfused with either 11,12-EET or rBNP, while mitochondrial glycogen synthase kinase-3beta was significantly lower in the same samples. Furthermore, treatment with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin abolished improved LVDP recovery in 11,12-EET-treated hearts but not did significantly inhibit recovery of rBNP-treated heart.
ether, these data indicate that EET-mediated cardioprotection involves BNP and PI3K signalling event.
 we described a splice variant of the human natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPR-Bi) in human proximal tubule cells [immortalized human kidney epithelial cells (IHKE-1) that lacks a functional guanylate cyclase domain (Hirsch JR, Meyer M, Mägert HJ, Forssmann WG, Mollerup S, Herter P, Weber G, Cermak R, Ankorina-Stark I, Schlatter E, and Kruhøffer M. J Am Soc Nephrol 10: 472-480, 1999). Its signaling pathway does not include cGMP, cAMP, or Ca2+ but leads to inhibition of K+ channels. In patch-clamp experiments, effects of tyrosine kinase receptor blockers on C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-mediated depolarizations of membrane voltages (Vm) of IHKE-1 cells were tested. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor blocker genistein (10 microM) abolished the effect of CNP (0.2 +/- 0.4 mV, n = 7), and comparable results were obtained with 10 microM daidzein (n = 8). Aminogenistein (10 microM, n = 5) and tyrphostin AG1295 (10 microM, n = 5) had no significant effects. EGF (1 nM) hyperpolarized cells by -5.3 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 5). This effect was completely blocked by genistein or daidzein. The Cl- channel blocker NPPB (10 microM, n = 5) inhibited the EGF-mediated hyperpolarization. mRNA expression of NPR-B and NPR-Bi shows reversed patterns along the human nephron. NPR-B is highly expressed in glomeruli and proximal tubules, whereas NPR-Bi shows strong signals in the distal nephron. Expression of NPR-Bi in the cortical collecting duct was also confirmed with immunohistochemistry. In other human tissues, NPR-Bi shows strongest expression in pancreas and lung, whereas in the heart and liver NPR-B is the dominating receptor. In conclusion, CNP inhibits an apical K+ channel in IHKE-1 cells independently of cGMP and so far this effect can only be blocked by genistein and daidzein. Tyrosine phosphorylation might be the missing link in the signaling pathway of CNP/NPR-B.
d the activation of a chloride channel in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) by guanylin. We have observed a background Cl current (ICl,background) and a guanylin-induced outward rectifying chloride currents (ORCC) in NHBE. ICl,background was present in 93% of cells (n = 114), was outwardly-rectifying, and could be completely blocked by 100 microM NPPB (5-Nitro-2(3-phenyl-propylamino)-benzoic acid. Activation of cAMP-activated Cl current with 200 microM CPT-cAMP (8-(4-Chlorophenylthio) adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate) occurred in only 35.3% of cells (n = 34). Gyanylin activated an ORCC in 78.6% (n = 11) of cells. Gyanylin also induced chloride currents in cells that had failed to respond to CPT-cAMP (n = 5). Both CPT-cAMP and the guanylin-induced chloride currents showed strong outward rectification. 500 microM DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanostibene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) blocked the guanylin-induced ORCC (n = 10.
activates a DIDS-sensitive ORCC in the NHBE cell which is only modestly activated by cAMP. The guanylin receptor in the NHBE might be of major importance in the regulation of chloride channel activity and transepithelial fluid transport in normal and abnormal airway.
ood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have identified 47 distinct genetic variants robustly associated with BP, but collectively these explain only a few percent of the heritability for BP phenotypes. To find additional BP loci, we used a bespoke gene-centric array to genotype an independent discovery sample of 25,118 individuals that combined hypertensive case-control and general population samples. We followed up four SNPs associated with BP at our p &lt; 8.56&nbsp;× 10(-7) study-specific significance threshold and six suggestively associated SNPs in a further 59,349 individuals. We identified and replicated a SNP at LSP1/TNNT3, a SNP at MTHFR-NPPB independent (r(2) = 0.33) of previous reports, and replicated SNPs at AGT and ATP2B1 reported previously. An analysis of combined discovery and follow-up data identified SNPs significantly associated with BP at p &lt; 8.56&nbsp;× 10(-7) at four further loci (NPR3, HFE, NOS3, and SOX6). The high number of discoveries made with modest genotyping effort can be attributed to using a large-scale yet targeted genotyping array and to the development of a weighting scheme that maximized power when meta-analyzing results from samples ascertained with extreme phenotypes, in combination with results from nonascertained or population samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcript expression data highlight potential gene regulatory mechanisms at the MTHFR and NOS3 loci. These results provide candidates for further study to help dissect mechanisms affecting BP and highlight the utility of studying SNPs and samples that are independent of those studied previously even when the sample size is smaller than that in previous studie.
208a (miR208a) and mechanical stress play a key role in cardiac hypertrophy. The relationship between miR208a and mechanical stress in cultured cardiomyocytes has not been investigated. The molecular mechanisms underlying miR208a-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes by mechanical stress is poorly understood. This study investigated whether miR208a is a critical regulator in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy under mechanical stretc.
rat cardiomyocytes grown on a flexible membrane base were stretched at 60 cycles/minute. MiR real-time quantitative assays were used to quantify miRs. A quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique was used to measure transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). A (3)H-proline incorporation assay was used to measure protein synthesi.
l stretch significantly enhanced miR208a expression. Stretch significantly induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophic protein expression such as β-myosin heavy chain (MHCβ), thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 100, myostatin, connexin 40, GATA4, and brain natriuretic peptide. MHCα was not induced by stretch. Overexpression of miR208a significantly increased MHCβ protein expression while pretreatment with antagomir208a significantly attenuated MHCβ protein expression induced by stretch and overexpression of miR208a. Mechanical stretch significantly increased the secretion of TGF-β1 from cultured cardiomyocytes. Exogenous addition of TGF-β1 recombinant protein significantly increased miR208a expression and pretreatment with TGF-β1 antibody attenuated miR208a expression induced by stretch. Mechanical stretch and overexpression of miR208a increased protein synthesis while antagomir208a attenuated protein synthesis induced by stretch and overexpression of miR208.
retch enhances miR208a expression in cultured rat cardiomyocytes. MiR208a plays a role in stretch-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The stretch-induced miR208a is mediated by TGF-β.
 oocytes within Graafian follicles are arrested at prophase I by factors from surrounding follicle cells, and resume meiosis after an LH surge from the pituitary. The maintenance of meiotic arrest requires high levels of cAMP, resulting from G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 3 and/or GPR12 activation of adenylyl cyclase within the oocyte. Recent studies indicate that natriuretic peptide precursor C (NPPC), acting via its cognate receptor NPR2, increases cGMP levels in granulosa cells; the cGMP then diffuses into oocytes and inhibits phosphodiesterase 3A activity and cAMP hydrolysis. Meiotic resumption is induced by LH via the generation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors in mural granulosa cells that activate EGF receptors in cumulus cells. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the actions of these growth factors on oocyte maturation are unclear. Herein we summarise the regulatory functions of NPPC and NPR2 in maintaining oocyte meiotic arrest and discuss the possibility that LH could stimulate meiotic resumption by decreasing NPPC content and NPR2 activit.
y was performed to gain insights into novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of autoimmune myocarditi.
stimulation of the efferent arm of the vagus nerve through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype-7α (α7-nAChR) has been shown to be protective in several models of inflammatory diseases. In the present study, we investigated the potentially protective effect of vagus nerve stimulation on myocarditi.
were immunized with cardiac troponin I (TnI) to induce autoimmune myocarditis. Mice were exposed to drinking water that contained nicotine in different concentrations and for different time periods (for 3 days at 12.5 mg/L; 3 days at 125 mg/L; 21 days at 12.5 mg/L; and 21 days at 125 mg/L after first immunization). TnI-immunized mice with no pharmacological treatment showed extensive myocardial inflammation and fibrosis and significantly elevated levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, elevated levels of mRNA transcripts of proinflammatory chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, and RANTES) and chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5) were found. Oral nicotine administration reduced inflammation within the myocardium, decreased the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and downregulated the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, RANTES, CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5. In addition, nicotine treatment resulted in decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-14, natriuretic peptide precursor B, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and osteopontin, proteins that are commonly involved in heart failure. Finally, we found that nicotine reduced levels of pSTAT3 (phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) protein expression within the myocardium. Neostigmine treatment did not affect the progression of myocarditi.
 that activation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway with nicotine reduces inflammation in autoimmune myocarditis. Our results may open new possibilities in the therapeutic management of autoimmune myocarditi.
asurements of neurohormones have been shown to improve prognostication in the setting of acute heart failure (HF) or chronic HF without therapeutic intervention. We investigated the prognostic role of serial measurements of emerging neurohormones and BNP in a cohort of chronic HF patients undergoing increases in HF-specific therap.
rospective study we included 181 patients with chronic systolic HF after an episode of hospitalization for worsening HF. Subsequently, HF therapy was gradually increased in the outpatient setting until optimized. We measured copeptin, midregional proadrenomedullin, C-terminal endothelin-1 precursor fragment, midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide, and B-type natriuretic peptide before and after optimization of HF therapy. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 24 month.
in-converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blockers were increased significantly during the 3-month titration period (P &lt; 0.0001 for both). In a stepwise Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic HF, baseline and follow-up neurohormone concentrations were predictors of the primary endpoint as follows (baseline hazard ratios): copeptin 1.92, 95% CI 1.233-3.007, P = 0.004; midregional proadrenomedullin 2.79, 95% CI 1.297-5.995, P = 0.009; midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide 2.05, 95% CI 1.136-3.686, P = 0.017; C-terminal endothelin-1 precursor fragment 2.24, 95% CI 1.133-4.425, P = 0.025; B-type natriuretic peptide 1.46, 95% CI 1.039-2.050, P = 0.02.
cologically unstable chronic HF patients, baseline values and follow-up measures of copeptin, midregional proadrenomedullin, C-terminal endothelin-1 precursor fragment, midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide, and B-type natriuretic peptide were equally predictive of all-cause mortality. Relative change of neurohormone values was noncontributor.
egulation of signaling pathways can lead to pathologies including cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We report that neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes express chromogranin B (CGB), a Ca(2+) binding protein that modulates Ca(2+) release by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R). Using fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator dyes, we found that CGB regulates InsP(3)-dependent Ca(2+) release in response to angiotensin II, an octapeptide hormone that promotes cardiac hypertrophy. ELISA experiments and luciferase reporter assays identified angiotensin II as a potent inducer of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a hormone that recently emerged as an important biomarker in cardiovascular disease. CGB was found to regulate angiotensin II-stimulated and basal secretion, expression and promoter activity of BNP that depend on the InsP(3)R. Moreover, we provide evidence that CGB acts via the transcription activity of nuclear factor kappaB in an InsP(3)/Ca(2+)-dependent manner but independent of nuclear factor of activated T cells. In vivo experiments further showed that cardiac hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II, a condition characterized by increased ventricular BNP production, is associated with upregulation of ventricular CGB expression. Overexpression of CGB in cardiomyocytes, in turn, induced the BNP promoter. The evidence presented in this study identifies CGB as a novel regulator of cardiomyocyte InsP(3)/Ca(2+)-dependent signaling, nuclear factor kappaB activity, and BNP productio.
ic peptides (NPs) may work as neuromodulators through their associated receptors [NP receptors (NPRs)]. By immunocytochemistry, we showed that NPR-A and NPR-B were expressed abundantly on both ON-type and OFF-type bipolar cells (BCs) in rat retina, including the dendrites, somata, and axon terminals. Whole-cell recordings made from isolated ON-type BCs further showed that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) suppressed GABAA receptor-, but not GABAC receptor-, mediated currents of the BCs, which was blocked by the NPR-A antagonist anantin. The NPR-C agonist c-ANF [des(Gln18, Ser19, Gln20, Leu21, Gly22)ANF(4-23)-NH2] did not suppress GABAA currents. The BNP effect on GABAA currents was abolished with preincubation with the pGC-A/B antagonist HS-142-1 but mimicked by application of 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclomonophosphate. These results suggest that elevated levels of intracellular cGMP caused by activation of NPR-A may mediate the BNP effect. Internal infusion of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823 essentially blocked the BNP-induced reduction of GABAA currents. Moreover, calcium imaging showed that BNP caused a significant elevation of intracellular calcium that could be caused by increased calcium release from intracellular stores by PKG. The BNP effect was blocked by the ryanodine receptor modulators caffeine, ryanodine, and ruthenium red but not by the IP3 receptor antagonists heparin and xestospongin-C. Furthermore, the BNP effect was abolished after application of the blocker of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase thapsigargin and greatly reduced by the calmodulin inhibitors W-7 and calmidazolium. We therefore conclude that the increased calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores by BNP may be responsible for the BNP-caused GABAA response suppression in ON-type BCs through stimulating calmoduli.
 from prostate cancer remains a significant problem with current treatment(s), with an expected 30 350 deaths from prostate cancer in 2005. Long-acting natriuretic peptide, vessel dilator, kaliuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide have significant anticancer effects in breast and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Whether these effects are specific and whether they have anticancer effects in prostate adenocarcinoma cells has not been determine.
tide hormones were evaluated to determine if they have specific anticancer effects in human prostate adenocarcinoma.
onse curves revealed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in human prostate cancer number with each tenfold increase in the concentration from 1 microM to 1000 microM (i.e. 1 mM) of these four peptide hormones. There was a 97.4%, 87%, 88% and 89% (P &lt; 0.001 for each) decrease in prostate cancer cells secondary to vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, kaliuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide, respectively, at their 1-mM concentrations within 24 h, without any proliferation in the 3 days following this decrease. These same hormones decreased DNA synthesis from 68% to 89% (P &lt; 0.001). When utilized with their respective antibodies their ability to decrease prostate adenocarcinoma cells or inhibit their DNA synthesis was completely blocked. Western blots revealed that for the first time natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR) A- and C- were present in prostate cancer cell.
ults indicate that these peptide hormones' anticancer effects are specific. Furthermore, they have very potent effects of eliminating up to 97% of prostate cancer cells within 24 h of treatmen.
 five molecules comprise the natriuretic peptide family (NPF): ANP, urodilatin, BNP, CNP and DNP. Precursor hormones for ANP, BNP and CNP are encoded by a different gene. Final peptides are ligands for A, B and C receptors, acting the latter as a clearance receptor besides neutral endopeptidase (EC 24.11). cGMP acts as a second messenger. Natriuretic peptides (NP) have well-known functions such as natriuretic, antihypertensive and reduction of plasma renin-aldosterone concentrations. An antiinflammatory ANP potential and a pro-apoptotic action in rats endothelial cells of different NP have been described. Unlike adults, NP show a different distribution during ontogeny and a different pattern of excretion under different stimuli. Noncompetitive immunoassays have become more suitable than competitive ones for routine measurement of NP with recent advances in speed of measurement. BNP and pro-BNP are emerging as useful tools in diagnosis, management and prognosis of heart disease. Preliminary data support a role of NP in the therapy of congestive heart failure. Finally, potential therapeutic compounds of NP in different pathologies are updated with an important focus on vasopeptidase inhibitors. These are capable of strengthening NP and inhibiting renin-angiotensin system at the same time, as potential useful molecules in cardiovascular therap.
n-1 (ET-1) at high concentrations has marked antidiuretic and antinatriuretic activities, whereas its precursor, big endothelin-1 (big ET-1), has surprisingly potent diuretic and natriuretic actions. The mechanisms underlying the excretory effects of big ET-1 have not been fully elucidated. To explore these mechanisms, we examined the effects of a highly selective ET(B) antagonist (A-192621.1), a calcium channel blocker (verapamil), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester [L-NAME]), and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) on the systemic and renal actions of big ET-1 in anesthetized rats. An intravenous bolus injection of incremental doses of big ET-1 (0.3, 1. 0, and 3.0 nmol/kg) produced a significant hypertensive effect that was dose dependent and prolonged (from 113+/-7 mm Hg to a maximum of 148+/-6 mm Hg). The administration of big ET-1 induced marked diuretic and natriuretic responses (urinary flow rate increased from 8.5+/-1 to 110+/-14 microL/min, and fractional excretion of sodium increased from 0.38+/-0.13% to 7.51+/-1.24%). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow significantly decreased only at the highest dose of big ET-1. Pretreatment with A-192621.1 (3 mg/kg plus 3 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)) significantly abolished the diuretic (17+/-5 microL/min to a maximum of 19+/-3 microL/min) and natriuretic (0. 29+/-0.1% to a maximum of 1.93+/-0.37%) responses induced by big ET-1. Moreover, A-192621.1 potentiated the decline in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and the increase in mean arterial blood pressure produced by the low doses of big ET-1. Similar to A-192621.1, pretreatment with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg plus 5 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)) significantly and comparably reduced the diuretic and natriuretic actions of big ET-1 and augmented the hypoperfusion/hypofiltration and systemic vasoconstriction induced by high doses of the peptide. Pretreatment with verapamil (2 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)) slightly inhibited the diuretic/natriuretic effects of the high-dose big ET-1 and completely prevented the increase in mean arterial blood pressure provoked by the peptide. Unlike verapamil and L-NAME, only indomethacin administration was associated with significant natriuretic/diuretic responses and did not influence the pressor effect and renal actions of big ET-1. Taken together, these results suggest that big ET-1-induced diuretic and natriuretic responses are mediated mainly by stimulation of nitric oxide production coupled to ET(B) receptor subtype activatio.
ic peptide receptors (NPR) are expressed in thyroid-derived cells, including the rat FRTL-5 thyroid cell line. We have previously demonstrated that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) binding consistent with the NPR-A receptor is significantly increased in FRTL-5 cells cultured in the presence of TSH. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether TSH treatment, therefore, results in higher levels of ANF-induced intracellular cGMP, and whether TSH elicits similar effects on cGMP signaling through the NPR-B receptor. We now show that contrary to expectation, long term exposure to 1 mIU/ml bovine TSH (6H medium) does not significantly alter maximal ANF-induced cGMP formation. Moreover, TSH treatment decreased C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-induced cGMP generation in FRTL-5 cells, suggesting a down-regulation of NPR-B. A similar effect of TSH on ANF- and CNP-induced cGMP was observed in FRTL cells, the precursor of the FRTL-5 cell line. Scatchard analysis of [125I]ANF binding in TSH-treated (6H) FRTL-5 cultures indicated a 5.6-fold increase in high affinity ANF-binding sites compared with TSH-deficient (5H) cultures [binding capacity (Bmax) of 6H cells, 227.2 +/- 33.7 fmol/mg protein; Bmax of 5H cells, 40.2 +/- 4.7 fmol/mg protein]. The effect of TSH on [125I]ANF binding was mimicked by forskolin and (Bu)2cAMP, indicating receptor up-regulation via a cAMP pathway. High affinity [125I]CNP-binding sites were present in much lower abundance (Bmax of 5H, 0.80 +/- 0.06 fmol/mg protein), and no effect of TSH treatment on them could be demonstrated. However, low affinity [125I]CNP binding was increased by TSH. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of both NPR-A and NPR-B transcripts in FRTL-5 cells and showed that TSH treatment significantly decreased NPR-B, but not NPR-A. NPR-C transcript was not detectable by RT-PCR in FRTL-5 cells cultured in high TSH medium, suggesting that the ANF-binding sites increased by TSH are not NPR-C. Both CNP and ANF transcript were also expressed in FRTL-5 cells, and CNP was increased by TSH. Together the data support the down-regulation of functional NPR-B and no change in functional NPR-A by TSH. The vast majority of ANF-binding sites in FRTL-5 cells, therefore, are not coupled to cGMP production and may represent a novel or altered form of NPR that is regulated by TSH independently of NPR-A and NPR-.
uretic peptide system is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension; a recent report indicated that disruption of the atrial natriuretic peptide precursor gene caused salt-sensitive hypertension. However, natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-A knockout mice did not show enhanced salt sensitivity of blood pressure. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NPR-C, the other receptor for atrial natriuretic peptide, in increased salt sensitivity of blood pressure. Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were placed on a 0.3% or 8% NaCl diet for 4 weeks. Blood pressure was elevated by salt loading only in DS rats. RNase protection assay demonstrated that NPR-C transcript level in the kidney was reduced by chronic salt loading in both DR and DS rats, whereas expression of NPR-A and NPR-B was not altered. The reduction of NPR-C mRNA in response to salt loading was enhanced in DS compared with DR rats. In situ hybridization indicated that the salt-induced NPR-C change was attributed mainly to suppressed expression of NPR-C in the podocytes. NPR-C gene expression was regulated by salt loading in a tissue-specific manner; the marked decrease in NPR-C mRNA by salt loading was seen only in the kidney. These data suggest that the exaggerated salt-induced reduction of NPR-C in the kidney of DS rats may play an important role in the pathogenesis of salt hypertension in this animal, possibly related to impaired renal sodium excretio.
erminal (JNK) family kinases have&nbsp;a common peptide-docking site used by upstream activating kinases, substrates, scaffold proteins, and phosphatases, where the ensemble of bound proteins determines signaling output. Although there are many JNK structures, little is known about mechanisms of allosteric regulation between the catalytic and peptide-binding sites, and the activation loop, whose phosphorylation is required for catalytic activity. Here, we compare three structures of unliganded JNK3 bound to different peptides. These were compared as a class to structures that differ in binding of peptide, small molecule ligand, or conformation of the kinase activation loop. Peptide binding induced an inhibitory interlobe conformer that was reversed by alterations in the activation loop. Structure class analysis revealed the subtle structural mechanisms for allosteric signaling between the peptide-binding site and activation loop. Biochemical data from isothermal calorimetry, fluorescence energy transfer, and enzyme inhibition demonstrated affinity differences among the three peptides that were consistent with structural observation.
 N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) is a promising drug target for the treatment of neurological disorders. Here we report a direct ELISA including the optimization of a nonradioactive immunosorbent JNK3 activity assay to determine inhibitory potency of small-molecule inhibitors. Based on our previous JNK3 assay and our recently optimized p38α mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) protocol for monitoring the phosphorylation of activating-transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), we present a rapid and straightforward alternative to conventional radioactive and indirect ELISA kinase assays. To validate the assay with the optimized assay conditions we used reference compounds and achieved well comparable IC(50) results to published data. The use of a linked monoclonal antibody increased the specificity and the sensitivity of the assay, reducing the required antibody concentration by approximately 100-fold. The novel protocol is an accurate, easy-to-handle and robust screening assay for JNK3 and the assay performance was reduced from 7.5 to 3.
erminal kinase 3alpha1 (JNK3alpha1) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase family member expressed primarily in the brain that phosphorylates protein transcription factors, including c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) upon activation by a variety of stress-based stimuli. In this study, we set out to design JNK3-selective inhibitors that had &gt;1000-fold selectivity over p38, another closely related mitogen-activated protein kinase family member. To do this we employed traditional medicinal chemistry principles coupled with structure-based drug design. Inhibitors from the aminopyrazole class, such as SR-3576, were found to be very potent JNK3 inhibitors (IC(50) = 7 nm) with &gt;2800-fold selectivity over p38 (p38 IC(50) &gt; 20 microm) and had cell-based potency of approximately 1 microm. In contrast, indazole-based inhibitors exemplified by SR-3737 were potent inhibitors of both JNK3 (IC(50) = 12 nm) and p38 (IC(50) = 3 nm). These selectivity differences between the indazole class and the aminopyrazole class came despite nearly identical binding (root mean square deviation = 0.33 A) of these two compound classes to JNK3. The structural features within the compounds giving rise to the selectivity in the aminopyrazole class include the highly planar nature of the pyrazole, N-linked phenyl structures, which better occupied the smaller active site of JNK3 compared with the larger active site of p3.
implicated in a range of brain pathologies and receive considerable attention as potential therapeutic targets. However, JNKs also regulate physiological and homeostatic processes. An attractive hypothesis from the drug development perspective is that distinct JNK isoforms mediate &quot;physiological&quot; and &quot;pathological&quot; responses. However, this lacks experimental evaluation. Here we investigate the isoforms, subcellular pools, and c-Jun/ATF2 targets of JNK in death of central nervous system neurons following withdrawal of trophic support. We use gene knockouts, gene silencing, subcellularly targeted dominant negative constructs, and pharmacological inhibitors. Combined small interfering RNA knockdown of all JNKs 1, 2, and 3, provides substantial neuroprotection. In contrast, knockdown or knock-out of individual JNKs or two JNKs together does not protect. This explains why the evidence for JNK in neuronal death has to date been largely pharmacological. Complete knockdown of c-Jun and ATF2 using small interfering RNA also fails to protect, casting doubt on c-Jun as a critical effector of JNK in neuronal death. Nonetheless, the death requires nuclear but not cytosolic JNK activity as nuclear dominant negative inhibitors of JNK protect, whereas cytosolic inhibitors only block physiological JNK function. Thus any one of the three JNKs is capable of mediating apoptosis and inhibition of nuclear JNK is protectiv.
erminal kinase 3alpha1 (JNK3alpha1) is a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family member expressed primarily in the brain that phosphorylates protein transcription factors including c-jun and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) upon activation by a variety of stress-based stimuli. In this study, the kinetic mechanism for JNK3alpha1 was determined via initial velocity patterns in the presence and absence of both ATP and ATF2 competitive inhibitors. Peptide inhibitors from both ATF2 (peptide 1) and JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1) (peptide 3), derived from the homologous delta-domain JNK docking sequence, inhibited JNK3alpha1 activity in a competitive fashion versus ATF2 while being pure noncompetitive toward ATP. In contrast, peptides derived from the phosphoacceptor activation domain on ATF2 (peptides 4 and 5) were recognized neither as substrates nor as inhibitors of JNK3alpha1. AMP-PCP and compound 6, a small molecule analinopyrimidine, exhibited pure noncompetitive inhibition versus ATF2 and competitive inhibition versus ATP. Peptide inhibitors based on the delta-domain sites of JIP ( 3) and ATF2 ( 1) were not recognized by p38, also of the MAPK family, which may give insight into finding more selective inhibitors for the JNK family of kinases. Collectively these data showed that JNK3alpha1 proceeded by a random sequential kinetic mechanism and that the ATP and ATF2 substrate sites were non-interacting. Moreover, these results established the 11-mer JIP peptide ( 3) as a potent ( K i = 25 +/- 6 nM) competitive inhibitor versus ATF2 in JNK3alpha.
erminal kinase 3 (JNK3) is a member of the stress-activated group of mitogen-activated protein kinases. c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 is a potent mediator of apoptosis and the use of JNK inhibitors or jnk3 gene deletion each protect against brain injury in adults. However, little is known about the role of JNK3 or its mechanism of action in neonatal brain injury. The aim of the present study was to compare the vulnerability of neonatal JNK3 knockout (JNK3 KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to cerebral hypoxic-ischaemic injury (HII) using unilateral-carotid occlusion combined with transient hypoxia. The degree of neural tissue loss in JNK3 KO mice was substantially reduced compared with WT mice (JNK3 KO 27.8%+/-2.8% versus WT 48.3%+/-2.0%, P&lt;or=0.0001) after HII. Significant attenuation of injury was observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus of JNK3 KO compared with WT mice. Hypoxic-ischaemic injury increased JNK phosphorylation and activity, with JNK3 as the major isoform. Significantly, in JNK3 KO animals there was no difference in the activation of the upstream kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK4) or MKK7. Downstream of JNK3, HII lead to increased phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and adenovirus transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), which was attenuated in JNK3 KO mice. c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 deletion also decrease caspase-3 cleavage and Bim/PUMA expression, coupled with a upregulation of AKT/FOXO3a levels, linking JNK3 to apoptosis. These findings implicate JNK3 involvement in neural cell loss resulting from cerebral HII in the developing brai.
ctivated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are involved in inflammation and tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In particular, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is highly activated in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes and synovium. However, defining the precise function of this kinase has been difficult because a selective JNK inhibitor has not been available. We now report the use of a novel selective JNK inhibitor and JNK knockout mice to determine the function of JNK in synoviocyte biology and inflammatory arthritis. The novel JNK inhibitor SP600125 (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one) completely blocked IL-1--induced accumulation of phospho-Jun and induction of c-Jun transcription in synoviocytes. Furthermore, AP-1 binding and collagenase mRNA accumulation were completely suppressed by SP600125. In contrast, complete inhibition of p38 had no effect, and ERK inhibition had only a modest effect. The essential role of JNK was confirmed in cultured synoviocytes from JNK1 knockout mice and JNK2 knockout mice, each of which had a partial defect in IL-1--induced AP-1 activation and collagenase-3 expression. Administration of SP600125 modestly decreased the rat paw swelling in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis. More striking was the near-complete inhibition of radiographic damage that was associated with decreased AP-1 activity and collagenase-3 gene expression. Therefore, JNK is a critical MAPK pathway for IL-1--induced collagenase gene expression in synoviocytes and in joint arthritis, indicating that JNK is an important therapeutic target for R.
a central immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes cell-mediated immune responses and the differentiation of naive CD4+ cells into Th1 cells. We and others have demonstrated that the Stat4 is critical for IFN-gamma production by activated T cells and Th1 cells. However, several studies have suggested that other pathways may be involved in IL-12-stimulated IFN-gamma expression. In this report we demonstrate that IL-12 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not p44/42 (ERK) or stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAPK. The activation of p38 MAPK is required for normal induction of IFN-gamma mRNA and IFN-gamma secretion by IL-12 in activated T cells and Th1 cells. Importantly, IL-12-stimulated p38 MAPK effector functions occur through a Stat4-independent mechanism and correlate with increased serine phosphorylation of activating transcription factor-2. The requirement for p38 MAPK in IL-12 function suggests that this pathway may be an important in vivo target for the anti-inflammatory actions of p38 MAPK inhibitor.
a 1 is predominantly a neuronal specific MAP kinase that is believed to require, like all MAP kinases, both threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation for maximal enzyme activity. In this study we investigated the in vitro activation of JNK3 alpha 1 by MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), MAP kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), and the combination of MKK4 + MKK7. Mass spectral analysis showed that MKK7 was capable of monophosphorylating JNK3 alpha 1 in vitro, whereas both MKK4 and MKK7 were required for bisphosphorylation and maximal enzyme activity. Measuring catalysis under Vmax conditions showed MKK4 + MKK7-activated JNK3 alpha 1 had Vmax 715-fold greater than nonactivated JNK3 alpha 1 and MKK7-activated JNK3 alpha 1 had Vmax 250-fold greater than nonactivated JNK3 alpha 1. In contrast, MKK4-activated JNK3 alpha 1 had no increase in Vmax compared to nonactivated levels and had no phosphorylation on the basis of mass spectrometry. These data suggest that MKK7 was largely responsible for JNK3 alpha 1 activation and that a single threonine phosphorylation may be all that is needed for JNK3 alpha 1 to be active. The steady-state rate constants kcat, Km(GST-ATF2++), and Km(ATP) for both monophosphorylated and bisphosphorylated JNK3 alpha 1 were within 2-fold between the two enzyme forms, suggesting the addition of tyrosine phosphorylation does not affect the binding of ATF2, ATP, or maximal turnover. Finally, the MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, had an IC50 value approximately 4-fold more potent on the monophosphorylated JNK3 alpha 1 compared to the bisphosphorylated JNK3 alpha 1, suggesting only a modest effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on inhibitor bindin.
 make up a small family of proteins with four mammalian members that play key roles in the regulation of multiple G protein-coupled receptor-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. Although arrestins were reported to serve as scaffolds for MAP kinase cascades, promoting the activation of JNK3, ERK1/2, and p38, the molecular mechanisms involved were not elucidated, and even the direct binding of arrestins with MAP kinases was never demonstrated. Here, using purified proteins, we show that both nonvisual arrestins directly bind JNK3α2 and its upstream activator MKK4, and that the affinity of arrestin-3 for these kinases is higher than that of arrestin-2. Reconstitution of the MKK4-JNK3α2 signaling module from pure proteins in the presence of different arrestin-3 concentrations showed that arrestin-3 acts as a &quot;true&quot; scaffold, facilitating JNK3α2 phosphorylation by bringing the two kinases together. Both the level of JNK3α2 phosphorylation by MKK4 and JNK3α2 activity toward its substrate ATF2 increase at low and then decrease at high arrestin-3 levels, yielding a bell-shaped concentration dependence expected with true scaffolds that do not activate the upstream kinase or its substrate. Thus, direct binding of both kinases and true scaffolding is the molecular mechanism of action of arrestin-3 on the MKK4-JNK3α2 signaling modul.
docking interactions between MAPKs and their activating MAPK kinases (MKKs or MEKs) are crucial for efficient and accurate signal transmission. Here, we report the identification of a MAPK-docking site, or &quot;D-site,&quot; in the N terminus of human MKK4/JNKK1. This docking site conforms to the consensus sequence for known D-sites in other MKKs and contains the first of the two cleavage sites for anthrax lethal factor protease that have been found in the N terminus of MKK4. This docking site was both necessary and sufficient for the high affinity binding of the MAPKs JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, p38 alpha, and p38 beta to MKK4. Mutations that altered conserved residues in this docking site reduced JNK/p38 binding. In addition, a peptide version of this docking site, as well as a peptide version of the JNK-binding site of the JIP-1 scaffold protein, inhibited both MKK4/JNK binding and MKK4-mediated phosphorylation of JNK1. These same peptides also inhibited JNK2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2, suggesting that transcription factors, MKK4, and the JIP scaffold compete for docking to JNK. Finally, the selectivity of the MKK4, MEK1, and MEK2 D-sites for JNK versus ERK was quantified. The MEK1 and MEK2 D-sites displayed a strong selectivity for their cognate MAPK (ERK2) versus a non-cognate MAPK (JNK). In contrast, the MKK4 D-site exhibited only limited selectivity for JNK versus ER.
osis is an estrogen-dependent disease. P38 and C-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors may have a therapeutic effect on endometriosis through regulation of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induced estrogen metabolis.
tive of this study was to determine whether the activated Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway observed in human ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) from ovarian endometriomas influences levels of aromatase and estrogen receptor β (ERβ) protein regulated by PGE2. In turn, the effects of inhibiting MAPKs in the presence of PGE2 on estrogen production were investigated in vitro and in viv.
n of aromatase and ER β (ERβ) regulated by PGE2 were much higher in ESCs than eutopic endometrial stromal cells (EMs) from the same person. Activation of p38, JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and ERK 5 MAPKs by PGE2 were observed in ESCs, where PGE2 stimulated aromatase and ERβ expression mainly through p38 and JNK pathway. P38 and JNK inhibition or siRNA knockdown blocked PGE2-induced aromatase and ERβ expression. PGE2 enhanced binding of downstream p38 and JNK transcription factors activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) and c-Jun to aromatase and ERB promoter regions in ESCs. Moreover, treatment of endometriosis xenografts with inhibitors of p38 and JNK abrogated PGE2-amplified estradiol synthesis and xenograft growt.
vates p38 and JNK signaling pathways, further stimulating c-Jun and ATF2 binding to aromatase and ERB promoter regions with elevated estradiol production. Inhibition of JNK and P38 may be a potential way in the treatment of human endometriosi.
en reported that remote ischemic postconditioning was able to protect from a harmful ischemia occurring in brain. In the present study, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK signal pathway in the process of neuroprotection and anti-apoptosis following remote limb ischemic postconditioning on rat focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four groups: the sham-operated group, I/R group, limb ischemic postconditioning (LPostC) group, and LPostC+SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) group. Focal ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Limb ischemic postconditioning was implemented by brief cycles of femoral artery occlusion. At 24h after modeling, we analyzed the neurological deficit score, assessed the cerebral tissue morphology by H-E staining, and evaluated neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining. The protein expression levels of p-p38 or p-ATF2 (phospho-activating transcription factor 2) in the penumbra region were detected by western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. Our findings revealed that LPostC relieved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing neurological score, improving neuronal morphological changes in the ischemic penumbra area, and reducing neuronal apoptosis. In addition, LPostC or LPostC+SB203580 attenuated the increase in p-p38 and p-ATF2 levels in ischemia/reperfusion brain tissue. These results indicate that the protective effects of LPostC against cerebral I/R injury may be related to the attenuation of neuronal apoptosis and the suppression of p38 MAPK-ATF2 pathwa.
ace travel, astronauts are exposed to a wide array of high-linear energy transfer (LET) particles, with differing energies and resulting biological effects. Risk assessment of these exposures carries a large uncertainty predominantly due to the unique track structure of the particle's energy deposition. The complex damage elicited by high charge and energy (HZE) particles results from both lesions along the track core and from energetic electrons, δ rays, generated as a consequence of particle traversal. To better define how cells respond to this complex radiation exposure, a normal hTERT immortalized skin fibroblast cell line was exposed to a defined panel of particles carefully chosen to tease out track structure effects. Phosphorylation kinetics for several key double-strand break (DSB) response proteins (γ-H2AX, pATF2 and pSMC1) were defined after exposure to ten different high-LET radiation qualities and one low-LET radiation (X ray), at two doses (0.5-2 Gy) and time points (2 and 24 h). The results reveal that the lower energy particles (Fe 300, Si 93 and Ti 300 MeV/u), with a narrower track width and higher number and intensity of δ rays, cause the highest degree of persistent damage response. The persistent γ-H2AX signal at lower energies suggests that damage from these exposures are more difficult to resolve, likely due to the greater complexity of the associated DNA lesions. However, different kinetics were observed for the solely ATM-mediated phosphorylations (pATF2 and pSMC1), revealing a shallow induction at early times and a higher level of residual phosphorylation compared to γ-H2AX. The differing phospho-protein profiles exhibited, compared to γ-H2AX, suggests additional functions for these proteins within the cell. The strong correspondence between the predicted curves for energy deposition per nucleosome for each ion/energy combination and the persistent levels of γ-H2AX indicates that the nature of energy distribution defines residual levels of γ-H2AX, an indicator of unrepaired DSBs. Our results suggest that decreasing the energy of a particle results in more complex damage that may increase genomic instability and increase the risk of carcinogenesi.
 is a natural product that shows benefits for metabolic syndrome (MS). However, the effects of berberine on the improvement of vascular inflammation and remodeling in MS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether berberine could prevent vascular remodeling and inflammation in the MS condition. A rat model of MS was established, and MS rats were divided into two groups: MS group without berberine treatment, and MSB group with berberine treatment (each group n-10). Ten normal Wistar rats were used as controls (NC group). Vascular damage was examined by transmission electron microscopy and pathological staining. Compared to the NC group, the secretion of inflammatory factors was increased and the aortic wall thicker in the MS group. The MSB group exhibited decreased secretion of inflammatory factors and improved vascular remodeling, compared to the MS group. In addition, the levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) were significantly decreased in the MSB group compared to the MS group. In conclusion, our data show that berberine improves vascular inflammation and remodeling in the MS condition, and this is correlated with the ability of berberine to inhibit p38 MAPK activation, ATF-2 phosphorylation, and MMP-2 expressio.
ne and methamphetamine addiction is described by specific behavioral alterations, suggesting long-lasting changes in gene and protein expression within specific brain subregions involved in the reward circuitry. Given the persistence of the addiction phenotype at both behavioral and transcriptional levels, several studies have been conducted to elucidate the epigenetic landscape associated with persistent effects of drug use on the mammalian brain. This review discusses recent advances in our comprehension of epigenetic mechanisms underlying amphetamine- or methamphetamine-induced behavioral, transcriptional, and synaptic plasticity. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that drug exposure induces major epigenetic modifications-histone acetylation and methylation, DNA methylation-in a very complex manner. In rare instances, however, the regulation of a specific target gene can be correlated to both epigenetic alterations and behavioral abnormalities. Work is now needed to clarify and validate an epigenetic model of addiction to amphetamines. Investigations that include genome-wide approaches will accelerate the speed of discovery in the field of addictio.
is a polycyclic polyprenylated acylphoroglucinol (PPAP) from the Garcinia genus, which has been used traditionally for cancer treatment across Southeastern Asia. In this study, we found that cambogin inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Cambogin induced the activation of the caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by an increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and the nuclear translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that the expression of proteins involving in the radical oxygen species (ROS) pathway was among the most affected upon cambogin treatment. Cambogin enhanced cellular ROS production, and induced the activation of the ASK1-MKK4/MKK7-JNK/SAPK signaling pathway. Pretreatment with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was able to restore cell viability in the presence of cambogin. Importantly, cambogin treatment led to the activation of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and the trimethylation of histone H3K9 in the activator protein 1 (AP-1) binding region of the Bcl-2 gene promoter. Finally, cambogin exhibited a potential antitumor effect in MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts without apparent toxicity. Taken in conjunction, the present study indicates that cambogin can induce breast adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis and therefore represents therapeutic potential for cancer treatmen.
-like kinase) inhibitors, such as BI-2536, have been reported to suppress IFNB (encoding IFNβ, interferon β) gene transcription induced by ligands that activate TLR3 (Toll-like receptor 3) and TLR4. In the present study, we found that BI-2536 is likely to exert this effect by preventing the interaction of the transcription factors IRF3 (interferon-regulatory factor 3) and c-Jun with the IFNB promoter, but without affecting the TBK1 {TANK [TRAF (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor)-associated nuclear factor κB activator]-binding kinase 1}-catalysed phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser³⁹⁶, the dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3 or the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2). Although BI-2536 inhibits few other kinases tested, it interacts with BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family members and displaces them from acetylated lysine residues on histones. We found that BET inhibitors that do not inhibit PLKs phenocopied the effect of BI-2536 on IFNB gene transcription. Similarly, BET inhibitors blocked the interaction of IRF5 with the IFNB promoter and the secretion of IFNβ induced by TLR7 or TLR9 ligands in the human plasmacytoid dendritic cell line GEN2.2, but without affecting the nuclear translocation of IRF5. We found that the BET family member BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) was associated with the IFNB promoter and that this interaction was enhanced by TLR3- or TLR4-ligation and prevented by BI-2536 and other BET inhibitors. Our results establish that BET family members are essential for TLR-stimulated IFNB gene transcription by permitting transcription factors to interact with the IFNB promoter. They also show that the interaction of the IFNB promoter with BRD4 is regulated by TLR ligation and that BI-2536 is likely to suppress IFNB gene transcription by targeting BET family member.
in 18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine and capable of stimulating proliferation of certain cell types. Nonetheless, its effect on normal liver cells cultured remains unclear. In the present study, we discovered that IL-18 expression level was remarkably elevated at 3.3 and 8.6h after synchronized BRL-3A rat liver cells (G0 phase) re-entering the cell cycle. In addition, recombinant rat IL-18 (rrIL-18) at dosages 5-10 ng/ml increased the cell viability compared to untreated cells (with medium only) at 24 and 48 h (P&lt;0.05). At the same time, the percentage of BrdU-labeling cells was also significantly increased (P&lt;0.01). On the other hand, knockdown of IL-18 expression with short interference RNA (siRNA), the cell viability began to decline at 24h and significantly decreased compared to negative control (NC) at 48 and 72 h after transfection (P&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, the number of cells in division phase (G2/M) was reduced in parallel. Further, after treatment with rrIL-18 (5 ng/ml), IL-18 and its receptor subunit IL-18Rα increased both at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the expression levels of adaptor molecule MyD88, transcription factor NF-κB and its downstream targets cyclin B1 and cyclin B2 were remarkably enhanced in BRL-3A cells stimulated by rrIL-18. Furthermore, transcription factor ATF2 and its targeted genes cyclin A2, Bcl-2 were also markedly increased after treatment with rrIL-18. These results demonstrated that IL-18 can augment cell proliferation via NF-κB and p38/ATF2 pathway by targeting cyclin B1, cyclin B2, cyclin A2 and Bcl-2 in BRL-3A rat liver cell.
tance of melanoma to current treatment modalities represents a major obstacle for durable therapeutic response, and thus the elucidation of mechanisms of resistance is urgently needed. The crucial functions of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in the development and therapeutic resistance of melanoma have been previously reported, although the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report a protein kinase C-ɛ (PKCɛ)- and ATF2-mediated mechanism that facilitates resistance by transcriptionally repressing the expression of interferon-β1 (IFNβ1) and downstream type-I IFN signaling that is otherwise induced upon exposure to chemotherapy. Treatment of early-stage melanomas expressing low levels of PKCɛ with chemotherapies relieves ATF2-mediated transcriptional repression of IFNβ1, resulting in impaired S-phase progression, a senescence-like phenotype and increased cell death. This response is lost in late-stage metastatic melanomas expressing high levels of PKCɛ. Notably, nuclear ATF2 and low expression of IFNβ1 in melanoma tumor samples correlates with poor patient responsiveness to biochemotherapy or neoadjuvant IFN-α2a. Conversely, cytosolic ATF2 and induction of IFNβ1 coincides with therapeutic responsiveness. Collectively, we identify an IFNβ1-dependent, cell-autonomous mechanism that contributes to the therapeutic resistance of melanoma via the PKCɛ-ATF2 regulatory axis.Oncogene advance online publication, 2 March 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.2.
n of brain-specific phenotypes increased in all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced neural differentiation of mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Among these phenotypes, expression of class IVa β-tubulin isotype (TUBB4a) was particularly enhanced in neural differentiation. Transient transfection assays employing a reporter construct found that ATRA-mediated regulatory region of the TUBB4a gene lay in the region from -83 nt to +137 nt relative to the +1 transcription start site. Site-directed mutagenesis in the AP-1 binding site at -29/-17 suggested that the AP-1 binding site was a critical region for ATRA-mediated TUBB4a expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggested participation of JunD and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in TUBB4a expression. Additionally, exogenous induction of the dominant-negative (dn) type of JunD canceled ATRA-induced upregulation of TUBB4a, and the dn type of ATF2 suppressed even the basal activity. Further immunoblot study revealed an ATRA-mediated increase in JunD protein, while a significant amount of ATF2 protein was constantly produced. These results suggest that differentiation-mediated activation of JunD results in enhanced TUBB4a expressio.
efensins (HBDs) are an important part of the innate immune host defense at the ocular surface. Unlike other defensins, expression of HBD9 at the ocular surface is reduced during microbial infection, but activation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in corneal epithelial cells has been shown to up-regulate HBD9. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that TLR2 has a key role in the signalling pathway(s) involved in the overexpression or underexpression of HBD9, and accordingly, different pathogens would induce a different expression pattern of HBD.
tro RNAi silencing method and response to dexamethasone were used to determine key molecules involved in signalling pathways of HBD9 in immortalized human corneal epithelial cells. The techniques included cell culture with exposure to specific transcription factor inhibitors and bacteria, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistolog.
y demonstrates that TLR2 induces HBD9 mRNA and protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays a central role in HBD9 induction by TLR2, and transcription factors c-JUN and activating transcription factor 2 are also involved. Dexamethasone reduces TLR2-mediated up-regulation of HBD9 mRNA and protein levels in mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1)-dependent and c-JUN-independent manner. HBD9 expression differs with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteri.
ated MKPs and nuclear factor-κB signalling pathways are involved in HBD9 expression. TAK-1 is a key molecule. These molecules can be potentially targeted to modulate HBD9 expression. Differential expression of HBD9 with different bacteria could be related to differences in pathogen-associated molecular patterns of these organism.
n-1 is a paracrine factor with mitogenic, melanogenic and survival effects on cultured human melanocytes. We report that endothelin-1 signalling reduced the generation and enhanced the repair of ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced DNA photoproducts, and inhibited apoptosis of human melanocytes, without increasing cAMP levels, melanin content or proliferation. Treatment with endothelin-1 activated the MAP kinases JNK and p38, as evidenced by phosphorylation of their target, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). Endothelin-1 also enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ATF-2 by UV. The effects of endothelin-1 were dependent on increasing intracellular calcium mobilization by endothelin B receptor signalling. Activation of both JNK and p38 was required for reducing DNA photoproducts, but only JNK partially contributed to the survival effect of endothelin-1. ATF-2 activation depended mainly on JNK, yet was not sufficient for the effect of endothelin-1 on UV-induced DNA damage, suggesting the requirement for other JNK and p38 targets for this effect. Our results underscore the significance of endothelin-1 and endothelin B receptor signalling in reducing the genotoxic effects of UV via activating JNK and p38, hence restoring genomic stability of melanocyte.
l-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Twist1 is a transcription factor that induces EMT, including E-cadherin suppression and cancer cell migration and invasion; hence it promotes cancer metastasis. Twist1 directly or indirectly regulates the expression of various genes and cellular functions involved in cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis for Twist1-mediated invasion and EMT. In human cancer cells, Twist1 was found to directly upregulate transcription of the mesenchymal gene integrin α5 in an E-box-independent, but activating protein-1 (AP-1) element-dependent, manner. Twist1 activated the integrin α5 promoter by interacting with and activating the transcription factor AP-1, composed of c-Jun and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2); it also enhanced the nuclear presence of ATF-2. AP-1 was critical for Twist1-induced cancer cell invasion, primarily through the induction of integrin α5, which activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and focal adhesion kinase-signaling activities. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that Twist1 expression positively correlates with integrin α5 expression in human colorectal cancers. These findings suggest that cooperation between Twist1 and AP-1 represents a novel mechanism for EMT and tumor invasiveness. This study supports further investigation into the molecular basis underlying the diverse Twist1-mediated functions that occur during tumor progressio.
id pregnenolone sulfate activates the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) via stimulation of transient receptor potential melastatin-3 (TRPM3) channels. Here, we show that the signaling pathway requires an influx of Ca(2+) ions into the cells and a rise in the intracellular Ca(2+) levels. The upregulation of AP-1 was attenuated in cells that overexpressed mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-1, indicating that Ca(2+) ions prolong the signaling cascade via activation of mitogen activated protein kinases. On the transcriptional level, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the basic region leucine zipper protein c-Jun, a major constituent of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, or expression of a c-Jun-specific short hairpin RNA attenuated pregnenolone sulfate-induced AP-1 activation. In addition, stimulation of TRPM3 channels increased the transcriptional activation potential of the basic region leucine zipper protein ATF2. Inhibition of ATF2 target gene expression via expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ATF2 or expression of an ATF2-specific short hairpin RNA interfered with TRPM3-mediated stimulation of AP-1. Moreover, we show that a dominant-negative mutant of the ternary complex factor (TCF) Elk-1 attenuated the upregulation of AP-1 following stimulation of TRPM3 channels. Thus, c-Jun, ATF2, and TCFs are required to connect the intracellular signaling cascade elicited by activation of TRPM3 channels with enhanced transcription of AP-1-regulated genes. We conclude that pregnenolone sulfate-induced TRPM3 channel activation changes the gene expression pattern of the cells by activating transcription of c-Jun-, ATF2-, and TCF-controlled gene.
tosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress appears to be one of the main causes of myocardial necrosis following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). The C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathway is the main pathway through which apoptosis is induced during ER stress. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is an important protein involved in the CHOP pathway. The present study investigated the hypothesis that MI/R activates the CHOP pathway through signaling via a pathway involving PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). Immunohistochemical staining of the heart tissues from spontaneously hypersensitive rats indicated that MI/R injury increases CHOP and GPR78 protein expression levels. To further analyze the mechanism by which MI/R injury induces apoptosis by ER stress, the expression levels of five marker proteins involved in the hypothetical PERK-eIF2α-ATF2 pathway were detected, namely PERK, phosphorylated PERK (P-PERK), eIF2α, phosphorylated eIF2α (P-eIF2α) and ATF2. An increase in the collective expression levels of these proteins would indicate that apoptosis was induced by this signaling pathway. In addition, the study also explored whether hypertension affects the signaling pathway of MI/R-induced myocardial apoptosis by treating spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with captopril (an effective drug used to treat hypertension). Rats treated with captopril experienced a reduction in blood pressure to normal levels, but no marked differences in the expression levels of the tested proteins or in MI/R injury severity compared with those in untreated rats. These results suggest that MI/R activates the CHOP pathway during ER stress by activating the PERK-eIF2α-ATF2 pathway and that hypertension does not affect this signaling pathwa.
g transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and its homolog ATF7 are phosphorylated at Thr-69/Thr-71 and at Thr-51/Thr-53, respectively, by stress-activated MAPKs regulating their transcriptional functions in G1 and S phases. However, little is known about the role of ATF2 and ATF7 in G2/M phase. Here, we show that Cdk1-cyclin B1 phosphorylates ATF2 at Thr-69/Thr-71 and ATF7 at Thr-51/Thr-53 from early prophase to anaphase in the absence of any stress stimulation. Knockdown of ATF2 or ATF7 decreases the rate of cell proliferation and the number of cells in M-phase. In particular, the knockdown of ATF7 severely inhibits cell proliferation and G2/M progression. The inducible expression of a mitotically nonphosphorylatable version of ATF7 inhibits G2/M progression despite the presence of endogenous ATF7. We also show that mitotic phosphorylation of ATF7 promotes the activation of Aurora kinases, which are key enzymes for early mitotic events. These results suggest that the Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of ATF7 facilitates G2/M progression, at least in part, by enabling Aurora signalin.
d Ginseng (KRG) is a representative traditional herbal medicine with many different pharmacological properties including anticancer, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-diabetes, and anti-inflammatory activities. Only a few studies have explored the molecular mechanism of KRG-mediated anti-inflammatory activit.
igated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the protopanaxadiol saponin fraction (PPD-SF) of KRG using in vitro and in vivo inflammatory model.
se-dependently diminished the release of inflammatory mediators [nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α, and prostaglandin E2], and downregulated the mRNA expression of their corresponding genes (inducible NO synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-2), without altering cell viability. The PPD-SF-mediated suppression of these events appeared to be regulated by a blockade of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and TANK (TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which are linked to the activation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3). Moreover, this fraction also ameliorated HCl/ethanol/-induced gastritis via suppression of phospho-JNK2 level.
ults strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory action of PPD-SF could be mediated by a reduction in the activation of p38-, JNK2-, and TANK-binding-kinase-1-linked pathways and their corresponding transcription factors (ATF2 and IRF3.
tic cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We previously reported the decreased expression of WWOX in EHCC samples, but the underlying mechanism remained unclea.
cipitation and immunofluorescence were performed to examine the interaction of WWOX and P38 MAPK. Western blot was carried out to detect the expression of ATF2 and eIF-4E. MTT, colony formation, and Annexin V-FITC assays were performed to detect the cell proliferation and apoptosis. IHC was performed to detect the protein expression in clinical sample.
racted with P38 and modulated its sub-cellular localization, leading to the cytoplasmic retention of P38. WWOX over-expression inhibited the phosphorylation of ATF2 and eIF-4E, while exogenous P38 reversed this reduction in phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of WWOX in EHCC cells led to inhibited proliferation and stimulated apoptosis in a P38 MAPK-dependent manner. In addition, we found a negative association of WWOX with nuclear localization of P38 and expression of phosphorylated ATF2 in EHCC sample.
demonstrated the role of WWOX in EHCC progression, revealing the potential of WWOX/p-ATF2 as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker, and therapeutic target for EHC.
en-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory protein that is activated in response to cellular stress. While p38 is known to be activated in response to cerebral ischemia, the precise role of p38 and its isoforms in ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis remains unclear. In the current study, we examined the differential activation and functional roles of p38α and p38β MAPK isoforms in short-term ovariectomized female rats treated with either the neuroprotective ovarian hormone 17beta-estradiol (E2) or placebo in a model of global cerebral ischemia (GCI). GCI induced biphasic activation of total p38 in the hippocampal CA1, with peaks at 30 min and 1 day after 10-min ischemia-reperfusion. Further study demonstrated that activated p38α, but not p38β, translocated to the nucleus 30 min and 3 h post reperfusion, and that this event coincided with increased phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a p38 target protein. Intriguingly, activated p38α was also enhanced in mitochondrial fractions of CA1 neurons 1 day after GCI, and there was loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as enhanced cytochrome c release and caspase-3 cleavage at 2 days post GCI. Importantly, E2 prevented the biphasic activation of p38, as well as both nuclear and mitochondrial translocation of p38α after GCI, and these findings correlated with attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction and delayed neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1. Furthermore, administration of a p38 inhibitor was able to mimic the neuroprotective effects of E2 in the hippocampal CA1 region by preventing nuclear and mitochondrial translocation of p38α, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and neuronal apoptosis. As a whole, this study suggests that changes in subcellular localization of the activated p38α isoform are required for neuronal apoptosis following GCI, and that E2 exerts robust neuroprotection, in part, through dual inhibition of activation and subcellular trafficking of p38.
38 phosphorylate a diverse set of substrates and, consequently, can act in a context-dependent manner to either promote or inhibit tumor growth. Elucidating the functions of specific substrates of JNK and p38 is therefore critical for our understanding of these kinases in cancer. ATF2 is a phosphorylation-dependent transcription factor and substrate of both JNK and p38. Here, we show ATF2 suppresses tumor formation in an orthotopic model of liver cancer and cellular transformation in vitro. Furthermore, we find that suppression of tumorigenesis by JNK requires ATF2. We identify a transcriptional program activated by JNK via ATF2 and provide examples of JNK- and ATF2-dependent genes that block cellular transformation. Significantly, we also show that ATF2-dependent gene expression is frequently downregulated in human cancers, indicating that amelioration of JNK-ATF2-mediated suppression may be a common event during tumor developmen.
acellular effects have been attributed to resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in grapes and in other plants, including the direct regulation of transcription. Here, we have analyzed the impact of resveratrol on gene transcription regulated by the cAMP response element (CRE.
tion of a chromatin-embedded reporter gene with CRE elements in its regulatory region was significantly elevated in resveratrol-treated 293 human embryonic kidney cells, hepatoma cells and neural stem cells. The CRE thus functions as resveratrol-responsive element. The polyphenols quercetin and naringenin also stimulated CRE-mediated gene transcription, but not in the range of resveratrol. The polyphenol curcumin, in contrast, had no effect upon CRE-regulated transcription. In addition, resveratrol stimulation upregulated the transcriptional activation potentials of the CRE-binding proteins CREB and ATF.
bits cytoprotective activity by stimulating CRE-regulated genes, while ATF2 has been identified as a tumor suppressor. The fact that resveratrol upregulates CRE-mediated gene transcription and enhances the transcriptional activation potentials of CREB and ATF2 suggests that cytoprotective and tumor suppressive activities of resveratrol may rely - at least in part - on the stimulation of CREB and ATF2-controlled target genes.

marrow (BM) microenvironment of multiple myeloma (MM) is reported to play a role in the biology of disease. In this study, we found that the extracellular BM microenvironment in MM contains a unique miRNA signature detectable by miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR, which is partially represented in the peripheral blood. Eleven miRNAs were significantly decreased in both BM and serum of MM patients in comparison with controls. Evaluation of these miRNAs in plasma of a separate cohort of MM patients and controls confirmed significantly aberrant levels of let-7a, let-7b, let-7i, miR-15b, miR-16, and miR-20a in both serum and plasma. We then studied the myeloma precursor diseases and found that a subset of the MM miRNAs exhibited aberrant expression in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering myeloma. miRNA analysis of enriched CD138(+) plasma cells from MM and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance found that most of the validated MM BM signature miRNAs were significantly decreased in MM plasma cells. Gene expression profiling indicated that multiple targets of the decreased miRNAs found increased expression in MM plasma cells, including ATF2, HRAS, HDAC4, TGFB1, TGFBR1, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. The findings suggest that these miRNAs are detectable in aberrant levels in the peripheral blood of patients with plasma cell proliferation and may play a role in aberrant plasma cell proliferation and disease progressio.
 is the current standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its efficacy is modest with low response rates and short response duration. Predictive biomarkers for sorafenib efficacy are necessary. However, efforts to determine biomarkers for sorafenib have led only to potential candidates rather than clinically useful predictors. Studies based on patient cohorts identified the potential of blood levels of angiopoietin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and transforming growth factor-β1 for predicting sorafenib efficacy. Alpha-fetoprotein response, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and treatment-related side effects may serve as early surrogate markers. Novel approaches based on super-responders or experimental mouse models may provide new directions in biomarker research. These studies identified tumor amplification of FGF3/FGF4 or VEGFA and tumor expression of phospho-Mapk14 and phospho-Atf2 as possible predictive markers that await validation. A group effort that considers various prognostic factors and proper collection of tumor tissues before treatment is imperative for the success of future biomarker research in advanced HC.
r activity of a novel curcumin analog (E)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-5-((E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acryloyl)cyclopentanone (CUR3d) was studied using a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). The results showed that CUR3d completely inhibits the tumor cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CUR3d at 100&nbsp;μmol/L activated the pro-apoptotic caspase-3 along with downregulation of anti-apoptotic BIRC5 and Bcl2. CUR3d treatment controlled the cancer cell growth by downregulating the expression of PI3K/Akt (Akt1, Akt2) pathway along with NF-κB. CUR3d down-regulated the members of epidermal growth receptor family (EGFR, ERBB3, ERBB2) and insulin like growth receptors (IGF1, IGF-1R, IGF2). This correlated with the downregulation of G-protein (RHOA, RHOB) and RAS (ATF2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) pathway signaling. CUR3d also arrested cell cycle via inhibition of CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK9, MDM2, MDM4 and TERT genes. Cell cycle essential aurora kinases (AURKα, AURKβ) and polo-like kinases (PLK1, PLK2, PLK3) were also modulated by CUR3d. Topoisomerases (TOP2α, TOP2β), important factors in cancer cell immortality, as well as HIF-1α were downregulated following CUR3d treatment. The expression of protein kinase-C family (PRKC-A, PRKC-D, PRKC-E) was also attenuated by CUR3d. The downregulation of histone deacetylases (Class I, II, IV) and PARP I further strengthened the anticancer efficacy of CUR3d. Downregulation of carcinogenic cathepsins (CTSB, CTSD) and heat shock proteins exhibited CUR3d's potency as a potential immunological adjuvant. Finally, the non-toxic manifestation of CUR3d in healthy liver and lung cells along with downregulation of drug resistant gene ABCC1 further warrant need for advance investigation.
ates autocrine and paracrine signaling in the vasculature and can propagate endothelial dysfunction. However, it is not clear how endothelial cells withstand H₂O₂ exposure and promote H₂O₂-induced vascular remodeling. To understand the innate ability of endothelial cells for sustaining excess H₂O₂ exposure, we investigated the genotypic and functional regulation of redox systems in primary HUVECs following an H₂O₂ treatment. Primary HUVECs were exposed to transient H₂O₂ exposure and consistent H₂O₂ exposure. Following H₂O₂ treatments for 24, 48 and 72h, we measured O₂(-) production, mitochondrial membrane polarization (MMP), and gene expressions of pro-oxidative enzymes, peroxidase enzymes, and cytoprotective intermediates. Our results showed that the 24h H₂O₂ exposure significantly increased O₂(-) levels, hyperpolarized MMP, and downregulated CAT, GPX1, TXNRD1, NFE2L2, ASK1, and ATF2 gene expression in HUVECs. At 72h, HUVECs in both treatment conditions were shown to adapt to reduce O₂(-) levels and normalize MMP. An upregulation of GPX1, TXNRD1, and HMOX1 gene expression and a recovery of NFE2L2 and PRDX1 gene expression to control levels were observed in both consistent and transient treatments at 48 and 72h. The response of endothelial cells to excess levels of H₂O₂ involves a complex interaction amongst O₂(-) levels, mitochondrial membrane polarization and anti- and pro-oxidant gene regulation. As a part of this response, HUVECs induce cytoprotective mechanisms including the expression of peroxidase and antioxidant enzymes along with the downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes. This adaptation assists HUVECs to withstand subsequent exposures to H₂O.
 (miRNAs) have been suggested to play critical roles in skeletal muscle in response to exercise. Previous study has shown that miR-761 was involved in a novel model regulating the mitochondrial network. However, its role in mitochondrial biogenesis remains poorly understood. Therefore, the current study was aimed to examine the effect of miR-761 on mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that aberrantly expressed miR-761 is involved in exercise activity and miR-761 is decreased by exercise training compared with the sedentary control mice. miR-761 suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis of C2C12 myocytes by targeting the 3'-UTR of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) coactivator-1 (PGC-1α). Overexpression of miR-761 was capable of inhibiting the protein expression levels of PGC-1α. Moreover, miR-761 overexpression suppressed the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and down-regulated the expression of phosphorylated MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (P-MK2), a downstream kinase of p38 MAPK. The phosphorylation of activating transcription factors 2 (ATF2) that plays a functional role in linking the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway to enhanced transcription of the PGC-1α was also inhibited by the overexpression of miR-761. These findings revealed a novel regulation mechanism for miR-761 in skeletal myocytes, and contributed to a better understanding of the modulation of skeletal muscle in response to exercis.
 family of small non-coding RNAs, have emerged as novel post-transcriptional regulators of numerous cellular responses. Although the involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of neuroinflammation in various neurological diseases has been previously studied, their role in the production of inflammatory mediators during microglia activation is poorly understood. In this study, the role of miR-26a has been investigated in the modulation of inflammatory response in cultured microglia. Using real time PCR, the expression of miR-26a was studied in TLR4 stimulated primary mouse microglia. miR-26a expression was found to be rapidly reduced after the stimulation of TLR4 in microglia. Overexpression of miR-26a significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-6, whereas knockdown of miR-26a increased the expression of these mediators. Furthermore, using in silico analysis, we identified that the activating transcription factor (ATF) 2 is directly targeted by miR-26a. This finding was confirmed by loss and gain of function studies. Similar to the effect of miR-26a overexpression, knockdown of ATF2 inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of miR-26a in the regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines in microglia. This article is protected by copyright.

one of the most important attributes defining wine quality in which yeasts play a crucial role, synthesizing aromatic compounds or releasing odourless conjugates. A present-day trend in winemaking consists of lowering fermentation temperature to achieve higher aroma production and retention. S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids seem to have inherited beneficial traits from their parental species, like fermenting efficiently at low temperature or producing higher amounts of certain aromatic compounds. In this study, allelic composition and gene expression of the genes related to aroma synthesis in two genetically and phenotypically different S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids, Lalvin W27 and VIN7, were compared and related to aroma production in microvinifications at 12 and 28 °C. In addition, the contribution of the allele coming from each parental to the overall expression was explored by RT-PC.
ts indicated large differences in allele composition, gene expression and the contribution of each parental to the overall expression at the fermentation temperatures tested. Results obtained by RT-PCR showed that in ARO1 and ATF2 genes the S. kudriavzevii allele was more expressed than that of S. cerevisiae particularly at 12 °.
y revealed high differences regarding allele composition and gene expression in two S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids, which may have led to different aroma profiles in winemaking conditions. The contribution of the alleles coming from each parental to the overall expression has proved to differently influence aroma synthesis. Besides, the quantitative contribution to the overall gene expression of the alleles coming from one parental strain or the other was clearly determined by the fermentation temperature for some gene.
st is a heterooctomeric complex well appreciated for its role in the dynamic assembly of specialized membrane domains. Accumulating evidence indicates that this macromolecular machine also serves as a physical platform that coordinates regulatory cascades supporting biological systems such as host defense signaling, cell fate, and energy homeostasis. The isolation of multiple components of the DNA damage response (DDR) as exocyst-interacting proteins, together with the identification of Sec8 as a suppressor of the p53 response, suggested functional interactions between the exocyst and the DDR. We found that exocyst perturbation resulted in resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and accelerated resolution of DNA damage. This occurred at the expense of genomic integrity, as enhanced recombination frequencies correlated with the accumulation of aberrant chromatid exchanges. Sec8 perturbation resulted in the accumulation of ATF2 and RNF20 and the promiscuous accumulation of DDR-associated chromatin marks and Rad51 repairosomes. Thus, the exocyst supports DNA repair fidelity by limiting the formation of repair chromatin in the absence of DNA damag.
inase Domain Containing, Cytoplasmic (PKDCC) is a protein kinase which has been implicated in longitudinal bone growth through regulation of chondrocytes formation. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which this occurs remains unknown. Here, we identified two new members of the PKDCC family, Pkdcc1 and Pkdcc2 from Xenopus laevis. Interestingly, our knockdown experiments revealed that these two proteins are both involved on blastopore and neural tube closure during gastrula and neurula stages, respectively. In vertebrates, tissue polarity and cell movement observed during gastrulation and neural tube closure are controlled by Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) molecular pathway. Our results showed that Pkdcc1 and Pkdcc2 promote the recruitment of Dvl to the plasma membrane. But surprisingly, they revealed different roles in the induction of a luciferase reporter under the control of Atf2 promoter. While Pkdcc1 induces Atf2 expression, Pkdcc2 does not, and furthermore inhibits its normal induction by Wnt11 and Wnt5a. Altogether our data show, for the first time, that members of the PKDCC family are involved in the regulation of JNK dependent Wnt/PCP signaling pathwa.
hown previously that preterm infants are at risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory bowel necrosis typically seen in infants born prior to 32 weeks' gestation, because of the developmental deficiency of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 in the intestine. The present study was designed to investigate all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) as an inducer of TGF-β2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and to elucidate the involved signaling mechanism.
cts on intestinal epithelium were investigated using IEC6 cells. TGF-β2 expression was measured using reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blots. Signaling pathways were investigated using Western blots, transiently-transfected/transduced cells, kinase arrays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and selective small molecule inhibitor.
tment of IEC6 cells selectively increased TGF-β2 mRNA and protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and increased the activity of the TGF-β2 promoter. AtRA effects were mediated via RhoA GTPase, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), p38α MAPK, and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2. AtRA increased phospho-ATF2 binding to the TGF-β2 promoter and increased histone H2B acetylation in the TGF-β2 nucleosome, which is typically associated with transcriptional activatio.
ces TGF-β2 expression in IECs via RhoA- and p38α MAPK-mediated activation of the transcription factor ATF2. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of atRA as a protective/therapeutic agent in gut mucosal inflammatio.
ancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer, related closely to tumor stage. High-grade ovarian cancer always results in a late diagnose and high recurrence, which reduce survival within five years. Until recently, curable therapy is still under research and anti-angiogenesis proves a promising way. Tumor-derived exosomes are essential in tumor migration and metastases such as angiogenesis is enhanced by exosomes. In our study, we have made comparison between high-grade and unlikely high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells on exosomal function of endothelial cells proliferation, migration and tube formation. Exosomes derived from high-grade ovarian cancer have a profound impact on angiogenesis with comparison to unlikely high-grade ovarian cancer. Proteomic profiles revealed some potential proteins involved in exosomal function of angiogenesis such as ATF2, MTA1, ROCK1/2 and so on. Therefore, exosomes plays an influential role in angiogenesis in ovarian serous cancer and also function more effectively in high-grade ovarian cancer cell.
injury is a serious complication of sepsis due to the gram-negative bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. One of the critical early steps in initiating this injury is via the interaction of leucocytes, particularly neutrophils, with adhesion molecules expressed on inflamed endothelium. We have previously demonstrated that both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and non-LPS components of meningococci can induce very high levels of expression of the vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule E-selectin, which is critical for early tethering and capture of neutrophils onto endothelium under flow. Using an LPS-deficient strain of meningococcus, we showed that very high levels of expression can be induced in primary endothelial cells, even in the context of weak activation of the major host signal transduction factor [nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)]. In this study, we show that the particular propensity for N. meningitidis to induce high levels of expression is regulated at a transcriptional level, and demonstrate a significant role for phosphorylation of the ATF2 transcription factor, likely via mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, on the activity of the E-selectin promoter. Furthermore, inhibition of E-selectin expression in response to the lpxA- strain by a p38 inhibitor indicates a significant role of a p38-dependent MAPK signalling pathway in ATF2 activation. Collectively, these data highlight the role that LPS and other bacterial components have in modulating endothelial function and their involvement in the pathogenesis of meningococcal sepsis. Better understanding of these multiple mechanisms induced by complex stimuli such as bacteria, and the specific inflammatory pathways they activate, may lead to improved, focused interventions in both meningococcal and potentially bacterial sepsis more generall.
renal, the type I 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B1) is expressed exclusively in the zona glomerulosa (ZG), where aldosterone is produced. Angiotensin II (AngII) and potassium (K(+)) are the major physiological regulators of aldosterone synthesis. However, their respective roles in regulation of aldosterone synthesis are not fully defined, particularly in terms of transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic enzyme genes. We previously showed that AngII can stimulate expression of HSD3B1. But, K(+) responsiveness of this gene has remained unexplored. Here, we report that K(+) stimulation lacks the ability to induce HSD3B1 expression in human adrenocortical H295R cells. Both AngII and K(+) were able to enhance transcription of the aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2). Promoter analysis revealed that although both AngII and K(+) activate transcription from the Ca(2+)/cAMP-responsive element (CRE) located in the CYP11B2 promoter, the orphan nuclear receptor NGFIB-responsive element (NBRE) located in the HSD3B1 promoter fails to respond to K(+), being only able to enhance transcription after AngII treatment. We found that induction of de novo protein synthesis of NGFIB occurs only after AngII treatment. This sharply contrasts with the phosphorylation that occurs in response to both AngII and K(+) on the CREB/ATF family transcription factor ATF2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that the NGFIB protein occupies the HSD3B1 promoter only after AngII, while ATF2 binds to the CYP11B2 promoter in response to both AngII and K(+). These data provide evidence that downstream signals from AngII and K(+) can be uncoupled in the regulation of HSD3B1 in the human adrenocortical H295R cell.
pathway is a universal signaling pathway regulating many cellular processes including metabolic routes, growth and differentiation. However, its effects on xenobiotic biotransformation and transport systems are poorly characterized. The effect of cAMP on expression and activity of GST and MRP2 was evaluated in Caco-2 cells, a model of intestinal epithelium. Cells incubated with the cAMP permeable analog dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP: 1,10,100μM) for 48h exhibited a dose-response increase in GST class α and MRP2 protein expression. Incubation with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, confirmed the association between intracellular cAMP and upregulation of MRP2. Consistent with increased expression of GSTα and MRP2, db-cAMP enhanced their activities, as well as cytoprotection against the common substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Pretreatment with protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors totally abolished upregulation of MRP2 and GSTα induced by db-cAMP. In silico analysis together with experiments consisting of treatment with db-cAMP of Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter construct containing CRE and AP-1 sites evidenced participation of these sites in MRP2 upregulation. Further studies involving the transcription factors CREB and AP-1 (c-JUN, c-FOS and ATF2) demonstrated increased levels of total c-JUN and phosphorylation of c-JUN and ATF2 by db-cAMP, which were suppressed by a PKA inhibitor. Co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP assay studies demonstrated that db-cAMP increased c-JUN/ATF2 interaction, with further recruitment to the region of the MRP2 promoter containing CRE and AP-1 sites. We conclude that cAMP induces GSTα and MRP2 expression and activity in Caco-2 cells via the PKA pathway, thus regulating detoxification of specific xenobiotic.
tive of this study is to investigate the effect of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on rat pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J and the functional mechanisms of DCA on AR42J cells. AR42J cells were treated with various concentrations of DCA for 24&nbsp;h and also treated with 0.4&nbsp;mmol/L DCA for multiple times, and then, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to detect the AR42J cell survival rate. Flow cytometric was used to detect the cell apoptosis and necrosis in AR42J cells treated with 0.4&nbsp;mmol/L and 0.8&nbsp;mmol/L DCA. The cells treated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) were served as control. In addition, the DNA-binding activity assays of transcription factors (TFs)&nbsp;in nuclear proteins of cells treated with DCA were determined using Panomics Procarta Transcription Factor Assay Kit. The relative survival rates were markedly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Compared with control group, the cell apoptosis and necrosis ratio were both significantly elevated in 0.4&nbsp;mmol/L DCA and 0.8&nbsp;mmol/L DCA groups (P &lt; 0.01). A significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in the activity of transcription factor 2 (ATF2), interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), NKX-2.5, androgen receptor (AR), p53, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was observed, and the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), activator protein 1 (AP1), and E2F1 was reduced (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, DCA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis and necrosis in AR42J cells. The expression changes of related genes regulated by TFs might be the molecular mechanism of AR42J cell injur.
8 amino acid peptide PYC98 was demonstrated to inhibit JNK1 activity toward c-Jun. We observed a 5-fold increase in the potency of the retro-inverso form, D-PYC98 (a D-amino acid peptide in the reversed sequence) when compared with the inhibition achieved by L-PYC98, prompting our further evaluation of the D-PYC98 inhibitory mechanism. In vitro assays revealed that, in addition to the inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation, D-PYC98 inhibited the JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of an EGFR-derived peptide, the ATF2 transcription factor, and the microtubule-regulatory protein DCX. JNK2 and JNK3 activities toward c-Jun were also inhibited, and surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed the direct interaction of D-PYC98 and JNK1. Further kinetics analyses revealed the non-ATP competitive mechanism of action of D-PYC98 as a JNK1 inhibitor. The targeting of the JNK1 common docking site by D-PYC98 was confirmed by the competition of binding by TIJIP. However, as mutations of JNK1 R127 and E329 within the common docking domain did not impact on the affinity of the interaction with D-PYC98 measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis, other residues in the common docking site appear to contribute to the JNK1 interaction with D-PYC98. Furthermore, we found that D-PYC98 inhibited the related kinase p38 MAPK, suggesting a broader interest in developing D-PYC98 for possible therapeutic applications. Lastly, in evaluating the efficacy of this peptide to act as a substrate competitive inhibitor in cells, we confirmed that the cell-permeable D-PYC98-TAT inhibited c-Jun Ser63 phosphorylation during hyperosmotic stress. Thus, D-PYC98-TAT is a novel cell-permeable JNK inhibito.
ammatory responses to Plasmodium falciparum GPI (pfGPI) anchors are believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of severe malaria. However, relatively little is known about the signal transduction pathways involved in pfGPI-stimulated inflammatory response and its potential contribution to severe malaria syndromes. In this study, we investigated the role of MAPK activation in pfGPI-induced cytokine secretion and examined the role of selected MAPKs in a model of cerebral malaria in vivo. We demonstrate that ERK1/2, JNK, p38, c-Jun, and activating transcription factor-2 became phosphorylated in pfGPI-stimulated macrophages. A JNK inhibitor (1,9-pyrazoloanthrone) inhibited pfGPI-induced phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, and activating transcription factor-2 and significantly decreased pfGPI-induced TNF-alpha secretion. pfGPI-stimulated JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation was absent in Jnk2(-/-) macrophages but unchanged in Jnk1(-/-) and Jnk3(-/-) macrophages compared with wild-type macrophages. Jnk2(-/-) macrophages secreted significantly less TNF-alpha in response to pfGPI than macrophages from Jnk1(-/-), Jnk3(-/-), and wild-type counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate a role for JNK2 in mediating inflammatory responses and severe malaria in vivo. In contrast to wild-type or Jnk1(-/-) mice, Jnk2(-/-) mice had lower levels of TNF-alpha in vivo and exhibited significantly higher survival rates when challenged with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. These results provide direct evidence that pfGPI induces TNF-alpha secretion through activation of MAPK pathways, including JNK2. These results suggest that JNK2 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in severe malari.
 N-terminal kinases (JNKs) mediate degeneration and apoptosis in the brain. Particularly, JNK3 is considered to be a degenerative enzyme with c-Jun as a relevant substrate. The contribution of individual JNK isoforms, however, to pathological as well as to physiological processes remains to be defined. To analyze the effects of a single JNK isoform on neuronal cell death and differentiation, we transfected PC12 cells, which normally express only JNK1 and JNK2, with JNK3-p54. Transfected JNK3 significantly enhanced cell death after UV irradiation (0.5-6 J/cm(2)) and paclitaxel/taxol treatment (1-10 microm). In contrast, in the context of nerve growth factor-induced (10 or 50 ng/ml) differentiation of PC12 cells, JNK3 expression significantly increased the number and length of neurites. This functional dichotomy of JNK3 was mirrored by differential activation and induction of nuclear JNK substrates; although activating transcription factor-2 phosphorylation was enhanced by death signaling in response to UV and taxol, c-Jun protein expression and N-terminal phosphorylation were increased during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. The absence of significant JNK activation or target phosphorylation in response to H(2)O(2) (60 microm) further supports the hypothesis that JNK isoforms are not merely injury- or stress-specific kinases but also have context-specific physiological function.
rotein kinase is a member of the MAP kinase group that is activated in response to dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Ten JNK isoforms were identified in human brain by molecular cloning. These protein kinases correspond to alternatively spliced isoforms derived from the JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 genes. The protein kinase activity of these JNK isoforms was measured using the transcription factors ATF2, Elk-1 and members of the Jun family as substrates. Treatment of cells with interleukin-1 (IL-1) caused activation of the JNK isoforms. This activation was blocked by expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase MKP-1. Comparison of the binding activity of the JNK isoforms demonstrated that the JNK proteins differ in their interaction with ATF2, Elk-1 and Jun transcription factors. Individual members of the JNK group may therefore selectively target specific transcription factors in viv.
eport we described the isolation of transcription factor E4BP4 by lambda gt11 expression cloning using a probe containing the CRE/ATF-like sequence located between -2764 bp and -2753 bp in the upstream regulatory region for the human IL-1 beta gene. DNaseI protection, gel mobility shift analysis, and cotransfection studies were performed to investigate the binding and functional properties of E4BP4 using IL-1 beta promoter sequences. By DNaseI footprinting, a protection pattern was generated over the CRE/ATF-like site and the flanking sequences by bacterially produced E4BP4. Competition experiment by gel shift assay indicated that E4BP4 bound specifically to CRE/ATF-like site, not NF kappa B-like site. In cotransfection studies, E4BP4 repressed promoter activity and this repression was mediated through the CRE/ATF-like site. Mutational analysis of E4BP4 suggested that the DNA binding as well as repression activities required leucine heptad repeat domain. Analysis of E4BP4 produced in Escherichia coli and Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus indicated that baculovirus produced protein showed enhanced binding to the CRE/ATF-like site compared to the E. coli-produced protein. Analysis of posttranslational modifications indicated that E4BP4 produced in Sf9 cells was phosphorylated and this phosphorylation was important for the DNA binding activity of E4BP.
tumors, resistance to therapy inevitably develops upon treatment with cytotoxic drugs or molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we describe a system that enables pooled shRNA screening directly in mouse hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in vivo to identify genes likely to be involved in therapy resistance. Using a focused shRNA library targeting genes located within focal genomic amplifications of human HCC, we screened for genes whose inhibition increased the therapeutic efficacy of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Both shRNA-mediated and pharmacological silencing of Mapk14 (p38α) were found to sensitize mouse HCC to sorafenib therapy and prolong survival by abrogating Mapk14-dependent activation of Mek-Erk and Atf2 signaling. Elevated Mapk14-Atf2 signaling predicted poor response to sorafenib therapy in human HCC, and sorafenib resistance of p-Mapk14-expressing HCC cells could be reverted by silencing Mapk14. Our results suggest that a combination of sorafenib and Mapk14 blockade is a promising approach to overcoming therapy resistance of human HC.
 &quot;tag-and-modify&quot; protein chemical modification strategy, we site-selectively phosphorylated the activation loop of protein kinase p38α. Phosphorylation at natural (180) and unnatural (172) sites created two pure phospho-forms. p38α bearing only a single phosphocysteine (pCys) as a mimic of pThr at 180 was sufficient to switch the kinase to an active state, capable of processing natural protein substrate ATF2; 172 site phosphorylation did not. In this way, we chemically recapitulated triggering of a relevant segment of the MAPK-signaling pathway in vitro. This allowed detailed kinetic analysis of global and stoichiometric phosphorylation events catalyzed by p38α and revealed that site 180 is a sufficient activator alone and engenders dominant mono-phosphorylation activity. Moreover, a survey of kinase inhibition using inhibitors with different (Type I/II) modes (including therapeutically relevant) revealed unambiguously that Type II inhibitors inhibit phosphorylated p38α and allowed discovery of a predictive kinetic analysis based on cooperativity to distinguish Type I vs I.
inase cascades, composed of a MAP3K, a MAP2K, and a MAPK, control switch responses to extracellular stimuli and stress in eukaryotes. The most important feature of these modules is thought to be the two double phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by MAP3Ks and MAP2Ks. We addressed whether the reactions are sequential or random in the p38 MAP kinase module. Mass spectrometry was used to track the phosphorylation of the MAP2K MEK6 by two MAP3Ks, TAO2 and ASK1, and the subsequent phosphorylation of p38α by MEK6/S*T* (where S (Ser) and T (Thr) are the two phosphorylation sites and * denotes phosphorylation). Both double phosphorylation reactions are precisely ordered. MEK6 is phosphorylated first on Thr-211 and then on Ser-207 by both MAP3Ks. This is the first demonstration of a precise reaction order for a MAP2K. p38α is phosphorylated first on Tyr-182 and then on Thr-180, the same reaction order observed previously in ERK2. Thus, intermediates were MEK6/ST* and p38α/TY*. Similarly, the phosphorylation of the p38α transcription factor substrate ATF2 occurs in a precise sequence. Progress curves for the appearance of intermediates were fit to kinetic models. The models confirmed the reaction order, revealed processivity in the phosphorylation of MEK6 by ASK1, and suggested that the order of phosphorylation is dictated by both binding and catalysis rate.
ynthesized γ-[(18)O4]-ATP and used it to develop a non-radioactive and multiplex method. Significantly, this novel approach can be applied to any kinases without using a purified enzyme or a fluorescent substrate. Using this approach, the effectiveness and specificity of inhibitors on several kinases could be readily determine.
 a novel pro-survival role for mammalian p38α in response to H(2)O(2), which involves an up-regulation of antioxidant defenses. The presence of p38α increases basal and H(2)O(2)-induced expression of the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide-dismutase 1 (SOD-1), SOD-2, and catalase through different mechanisms, which protects from reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and prevents cell death. p38α was found to regulate (i) H(2)O(2)-induced SOD-2 expression through a direct regulation of transcription mediated by activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and (ii) H(2)O(2)-induced catalase expression through regulation of protein stability and mRNA expression and/or stabilization. As a consequence, SOD and catalase activities are higher in WT MEFs. We also found that this p38α-dependent antioxidant response allows WT cells to maintain an efficient activation of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Accordingly, the loss of p38α leads to ROS accumulation in response to H(2)O(2), which causes cell death and inactivation of mTOR/p70S6K signaling. This can be rescued by either p38α re-expression or treatment with the antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine, or exogenously added catalase. Therefore, our results reveal a novel homeostatic role for p38α in response to oxidative stress, where ROS removal is favored by antioxidant enzymes up-regulation, allowing cell survival and mTOR/p70S6K activatio.
s-activated protein kinase (SAPK) p38 can induce apoptosis, and its inhibition facilitates mammary tumorigenesis. We found that during mammary acinar morphogenesis in MCF-10A cells grown in three-dimensional culture, detachment of luminal cells from the basement membrane stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases 3 and 6 (MKK3/6) and p38α signaling to promote anoikis. p38α signaling increased transcription of the death-promoting protein BimEL by phosphorylating the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and increasing c-Jun protein abundance, leading to cell death by anoikis and acinar lumen formation. Inhibition of p38α or ATF-2 caused luminal filling reminiscent of that observed in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The mammary glands of MKK3/6 knockout mice (MKK3(-/-)/MKK6(+/- )) showed accelerated branching morphogenesis relative to those of wild-type mice, as well as ductal lumen occlusion due to reduced anoikis. This phenotype was recapitulated by systemic pharmacological inhibition of p38α and β (p38α/β) in wild-type mice. Moreover, the development of DCIS-like lesions showing marked ductal occlusion was accelerated in MMTV-Neu transgenic mice treated with inhibitors of p38α and p38β. We conclude that p38α is crucial for the development of hollow ducts during mammary gland development, a function that may be crucial to its ability to suppress breast cance.
nhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), CMPD1, identified by high-throughput screening, is characterized herein. Unlike the p38 inhibitors described previously, this inhibitor is substrate selective and noncompetitive with ATP. In steady-state kinetics experiments, CMPD1 was observed to prevent the p38alpha-dependent phosphorylation (K(i)(app) = 330 nM) of the splice variant of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2a) that contains a docking domain for p38alpha and p38beta, but it did not prevent the phosphorylation of ATF-2 (K(i)(app) &gt; 20 microM). In addition to kinetic studies, isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition. While isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicated that CMPD1 binds to p38alpha, CMPD1 was not observed to compete with ATP for p38alpha, nor was it able to interrupt the binding of p38alpha to MK2a observed by surface plasmon resonance. Therefore, deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) was employed to study the p38alpha.CMPD1 inhibitory complex, to provide new insight into the mechanism of substrate selective inhibition. The DXMS data obtained for the p38alpha.CMPD1 complex were compared to the data obtained for the p38alpha.MK2a complex and a p38alpha.active site binding inhibitor complex. Alterations in the DXMS behavior of both p38alpha and MK2a were observed upon complex formation, including but not limited to the interaction between the carboxy-terminal docking domain of MK2a and its binding groove on p38alpha. Alterations in the D(2)O exchange of p38alpha produced by CMPD1 suggest that the substrate selective inhibitor binds in the vicinity of the active site of p38alpha, resulting in perturbations to regions containing nucleotide binding pocket residues, docking groove residues (E160 and D161), and a Mg(2+) ion cofactor binding residue (D168). Although the exact mechanism of substrate selective inhibition by this novel inhibitor has not yet been disclosed, the results suggest that CMPD1 binding in the active site region of p38alpha induces perturbations that may result in the suboptimal positioning of substrates and cofactors in the transition state, resulting in selective inhibition of p38alpha activit.
ctivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are central signaling elements, which translate and integrate stimuli from cell surface receptors into cytoplasmic and transcriptional responses. Here, we systematically compare the role of MAPKs in the nerve growth factor-induced long-term differentiation of PC12 cells and show the persistent nuclear and dose-dependent cytoplasmic activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and the increasing nuclear and cytoplasmic activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNKs significantly reduced neurite outgrowth. Both synergistically controlled the expression of c-Jun, the induction and/or phosphorylation of neurofilament, and the phosphorylation of Elk-1. JNKs alone were responsible for the phosphorylation of c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 as well as for the expression of MAPK phosphatase 1. In contrast, p38alpha was only transiently activated and marginally involved in these processes. Thus, JNKs and ERK1/2 accomplish differentiation by signaling in parallel cascades that converge only at the target leve.
ing growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis that leads to renal fibrosis. Intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in this process remain incompletely understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a major stress signal-transducing pathway, and we have previously reported activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-beta1 in rat mesangial cells and its role in the stimulation of pro-alpha1(I) collagen. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of p38 MAPK activation by TGF-beta1 and the role of MKK3, an upstream MAPK kinase of p38 MAPK, by examining the effect of targeted disruption of the Mkk3 gene. We first isolated glomerular mesangial cells from MKK3-null (Mkk3-/-) and wild-type (Mkk3+/+) control mice. Treatment with TGF-beta1 induced rapid phosphorylation of MKK3 as well as p38 MAPK within 15 min in cultured wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mouse mesangial cells. In contrast, TGF-beta1 failed to induce phosphorylation of either MKK3 or p38 MAPK in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mouse mesangial cells, indicating that MKK3 is required for TGF-beta1-induced p38 MAPK activation. TGF-beta1 selectively activated the p38 MAPK isoforms p38alpha and p38delta in wild-type (Mkk3+/+) mesangial cells, but not in MKK3-deficient (Mkk3-/-) mesangial cells. Thus, activation of p38alpha and p38delta is dependent on the activation of upstream MKK3 by TGF-beta1. Furthermore, MKK3 deficiency resulted in a selective disruption of TGF-beta1-stimulated up-regulation of pro-alpha1(I) collagen expression but not TGF-beta1 induction of fibronectin and PAI-1. These data demonstrate that the MKK3 is a critical component of the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway, and its activation is required for subsequent p38alpha and p38delta MAPK activation and collagen stimulation by TGF-beta.
to study the role of Phe169 in p38alpha MAP kinase structure and function, wild-type p38alpha and five p38alpha DFG motif mutants were examined in vitro for phosphorylation by MKK6, kinase activity toward ATF2 substrate, thermal stability, and X-ray crystal structure. All six p38alpha variants were efficiently phosphorylated by MKK6. However, only one activated p38alpha mutant (F169Y) possessed measurable kinase activity (1% compared to wild-type). The loss of kinase activity among the DFG mutants may result from an inability to correctly position Asp168 in the activated form of p38alpha. Two mutations significantly increased the thermal stability of p38alpha (F169A DeltaTm = 1.3 degrees C and D168G DeltaTm = 3.8 degrees C), and two mutations significantly decreased the stability of p38alpha (F169R DeltaTm = -3.2 degrees C and F169G DeltaTm = -4.7 degrees C). Interestingly, X-ray crystal structures of two thermally destabilized p38alpha-F169R and p38alpha-F169G mutants revealed a DFG-OUT conformation in the absence of an inhibitor molecule. This DFG-OUT conformation, termed alpha-DFG-OUT, is different from the ones previously identified in p38alpha crystal structures with bound inhibitors and postulated from high-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Taken together, these results indicate that Phe169 is optimized for p38alpha functional activity and structural dynamics, rather than for structural stability. The alpha-DFG-OUT conformation observed for p38alpha-F169R and p38alpha-F169G may represent a naturally occurring intermediate state of p38alpha that provides access for binding of allosteric inhibitors. A model of the local forces driving the DFG IN-OUT transition in p38alpha is propose.
of the genome for selection signatures between breeds may play important role in understanding the underlie causes for observable phenotypic variations. The discovery of high density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide a useful starting point to perform genome-wide scan in pig populations in order to identify loci/candidate genes underlie phenotypic variation in pig breeds and facilitate genetic improvement programs. However, prior to this study genomic region under selection in commercially selected Berkshire and Korean native pig breeds has never been detected using high density SNP markers. To this end, we have genotyped 45 animals using Porcine SNP60 chip to detect selection signatures in the genome of the two breeds by using the F ST approac.
mparison of Berkshire and KNP breeds using the FDIST approach, a total of 1108 outlier loci (3.48%) were significantly different from zero at 99% confidence level with 870 of the outlier SNPs displaying high level of genetic differentiation (F ST ≥0.490). The identified candidate genes were involved in a wide array of biological processes and molecular functions. Results revealed that 19 candidate genes were enriched in phosphate metabolism (GO: 0006796; ADCK1, ACYP1, CAMK2D, CDK13, CDK13, ERN1, GALK2, INPP1; MAK, MAP2K5, MAP3K1, MAPK14, P14KB, PIK3C3, PRKC1, PTPRK, RNASEL, THBS1, BRAF, VRK1). We have identified a set of candidate genes under selection and have known to be involved in growth, size and pork quality (CART, AGL, CF7L2, MAP2K5, DLK1, GLI3, CA3 and MC3R), ear morphology and size (HMGA2 and SOX5) stress response (ATF2, MSRB3, TMTC3 and SCAF8) and immune response ( HCST and RYR1.
he genes may be used to facilitate genetic improvement programs. Our results also provide insights for better understanding of the process and influence of breed development on the pattern of genetic variation.
 splicing of key signaling molecules in the Toll-like receptor (Tlr) cascade has been shown to dramatically alter the signaling capacity of inflammatory cells, but it is not known how common this mechanism is. We provide transcriptional evidence of widespread alternate splicing in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, derived from a systematic analysis of the FANTOM3 mouse data set. Functional annotation of variant proteins was assessed in light of inflammatory signaling in mouse primary macrophages, and the expression of each variant transcript was assessed by splicing array.
f 256 variant transcripts were identified, including novel variants of Tlr4, Ticam1, Tollip, Rac1, Irak1, 2 and 4, Mapk14/p38, Atf2 and Stat1. The expression of variant transcripts was assessed using custom-designed splicing arrays. We functionally tested the expression of Tlr4 transcripts under a range of cytokine conditions via northern and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The effects of variant Mapk14/p38 protein expression on macrophage survival were demonstrate.
f the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are highly alternatively spliced, producing a large number of novel proteins with the potential to functionally alter inflammatory outcomes. These variants are expressed in primary mouse macrophages in response to inflammatory mediators such as interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Our data suggest a surprisingly common role for variant proteins in diversification/repression of inflammatory signalin.
ted form of the human cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding protein 2 (CSBP2) kinase was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) cells from a baculovirus vector. To maximize expression and to facilitate purification of the recombinant protein, CSBP2 kinase was expressed as a carboxy-terminal fusion protein to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Under optimal conditions, 2-3 mg of GST-CSBP2 could be obtained per liter of infected cell culture. The fusion protein was easily purified from the soluble fraction of the total cell lysate under nondenaturing conditions by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity resin. As expected, the purified GST-CSBP2 fusion protein was approximately 68 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and reacted with antibodies directed toward either the GST or the CSBP amino terminus. To obtain activated CSBP2, SF9 cells were coinfected with two recombinant baculovirus vectors: one that directed the synthesis of the GST-CSBP2 fusion protein and a second vector that directed the synthesis of a constitutively active form of the CSBP activating kinase, MKK3. Coexpression of GST-CSBP2 kinase with the MKK3 activator increased GST-CSBP2 activity 8- to 10-fold based on the ability of GST-CSBP2 to phosphorylate the substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP), and the ATF2 transcription factor, in vitro. Moreover, activated GST-CSBP2 was capable of activating a bacterially derived mitogen-activated protein kinase-activating protein kinase 2 in vitro. The activity of insect-derived GST-CSBP2 was also inhibited by the CSBP inhibitor, SB202190. We anticipate that the preparation and purification techniques described in this study will facilitate further biochemical characterization of this kinas.
vascular arginase activity can impair endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by decreasing l-arginine availability to endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, thereby reducing NO production and uncoupling NOS function. Elevated angiotensin II (Ang II) is a key component of endothelial dysfunction in many cardiovascular diseases and has been linked to elevated arginase activity. In this study we explored the signaling pathway leading to increased arginase expression/activity in response to Ang II in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Our previous studies indicate involvement of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) in Ang II-induced arginase upregulation and reduced NO production. In this study, we further investigated the Ang II-transcriptional regulation of arginase 1 in endothelial cells. Our results indicate the involvement of ATF-2 transcription factor of the AP1 family in arginase 1 upregulation and in limiting NO production. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting ATF-2, we showed that this transcription factor is required for Ang II-induced arginase 1 gene upregulation and increased arginase 1 expression and activity, leading to reduced NO production. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed the involvement of ATF-2. Moreover, our data indicate that p38 MAPK phosphorylates ATF-2 in response to Ang II. Collectively, our results indicate that Ang II increases endothelial arginase activity/expression through a p38 MAPK/ATF-2 pathway leading to reduced endothelial NO production. These signaling steps might be therapeutic targets for preventing vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with elevated arginase activity/expressio.
ular nucleotides that constitute a &quot;danger signal&quot; play an important role in the regulation of immune responses. However, the function and mechanism of extracellular UDP and P2Y6 in antiviral immunity remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo protection of UDP/P2Y6 signaling in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. First, we demonstrated that VSV-infected cells secrete UDP from the cytoplasm as a danger signal to arouse surrounding cells. Meanwhile, expression of the UDP-specific receptor P2Y6 also was enhanced by VSV. Consequently, UDP protects RAW 264.7 cells, murine embryonic fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and L929 cells from VSV and GFP lentivirus infection. This protection can be blocked by the P2Y6 selective antagonist MRS2578 or IFN-α/β receptor-blocking Ab. VSV-induced cell death and virus replication were both enhanced significantly by knocking down and knocking out P2Y6 in different cells. Mechanistically, UDP facilitates IFN-β secretion through the p38/JNK- and ATF-2/c-Jun-signaling pathways, which are crucial in promoting antiviral immunity. Interestingly, UDP was released through a caspase-cleaved pannexin-1 channel in VSV-induced apoptotic cells and protected cells from infection through P2Y6 receptor in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Furthermore, UDP also protected mice from VSV infection through P2Y6 receptors in an acute neurotropic infection mouse model. Taken together, these results demonstrate the important role of extracellular UDP and P2Y6 as a danger signal in antiviral immune responses and suggest a potential therapeutic role for UDP/P2Y6 in preventing and controlling viral disease.
itogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cassette has been implicated in stress and immunity in evolutionarily diverse species. In response to a wide variety of physical, chemical and biological stresses p38 kinases phosphorylate various substrates, transcription factors of the ATF family and other protein kinases, regulating cellular adaptation to stress. The Drosophila genome encodes three p38 kinases named p38a, p38b and p38c. In this study, we have analyzed the role of p38c in the Drosophila intestine. The p38c gene is expressed in the midgut and upregulated upon intestinal infection. We showed that p38c mutant flies are more resistant to infection with the lethal pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila but are more susceptible to the non-pathogenic bacterium Erwinia carotovora 15. This phenotype was linked to a lower production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the gut of p38c mutants, whereby the transcription of the ROS-producing enzyme Duox is reduced in p38c mutant flies. Our genetic analysis shows that p38c functions in a pathway with Mekk1 and Mkk3 to induce the phosphorylation of Atf-2, a transcription factor that controls Duox expression. Interestingly, p38c deficient flies accumulate lipids in the intestine while expressing higher levels of antimicrobial peptide and metabolic genes. The role of p38c in lipid metabolism is mediated by the Atf3 transcription factor. This observation suggests that p38c and Atf3 function in a common pathway in the intestine to regulate lipid metabolism and immune homeostasis. Collectively, our study demonstrates that p38c plays a central role in the intestine of Drosophila. It also reveals that many roles initially attributed to p38a are in fact mediated by p38.
gnize pathogen-expressed Ags and elicit host-protective immune response. Although TLR2 forms heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6, recognizing different ligands, differences in the functions of these heterodimers remain unknown. In this study, we report that in Leishmania major-infected macrophages, the expression of TLR1 and TLR2, but not TLR6, increased; TLR2-TLR2 association increased, but TLR2-TLR6 association diminished. Lentivirus-expressed TLR1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or TLR2-shRNA administration reduced, but TLR6-shRNA increased L. major infection in BALB/c mice. Corroboratively, Pam3CSK4 (TLR1-TLR2 ligand) and peptidoglycan (TLR2 ligand) increased L. major infection but reduced TLR9 expression, whereas pegylated bisacycloxypropylcysteine (BPPcysMPEG; TLR2-TLR6 ligand) reduced L. major number in L. major-infected macrophages, accompanied by increased TLR9 expression, higher IL-12 production, and inducible NO synthase expression. Whereas MyD88, Toll/IL-1R adaptor protein, and TNFR-α-associated factor 6 recruitments to TLR2 were not different in Pam3CSK4-, peptidoglycan-, or BPPcysMPEG-treated macrophages, only BPPcysMPEG enhanced p38MAPK and activating transcription factor 2 activation. BPPcysMPEG conferred antileishmanial functions to L. major-infected BALB/c-derived T cells in a macrophage-T cell coculture and in BALB/c mice; the protection was TLR6 dependent and IL-12 dependent, and it was accompanied by reduced regulatory T cell number. BPPcysMPEG administration during the priming with fixed L. major protected BALB/c mice against challenge L. major infection; the protection was accompanied by low IL-4 and IL-10, but high IFN-γ productions and reduced regulatory T cells. Thus, BPPcysMPEG, a novel diacylated lipopeptide ligand for TLR2-TLR6 heterodimer, induces IL-12-dependent, inducible NO synthase-dependent, T-reg-sensitive antileishmanial protection. The data reveal a novel dimerization partner-dependent duality in TLR2 functio.
g transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) has been implicated as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer (BC). c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK phosphorylate ATF-2 within the activation domain (AD), which is required for its transcriptional activity. To date, the role of ATF-2 in determining response to endocrine therapy has not been explored. Effects of ATF-2 loss in the oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive luminal BC cell line MCF7 were explored, as well as its role in response to tamoxifen treatment. Genome-wide chromatin binding patterns of ATF-2 when phosphorylated within the AD in MCF-7 cells were determined using ChIP-seq. The expression of ATF-2 and phosphorylated ATF-2 (pATF-2-Thr71) was determined in a series of 1,650 BC patients and correlated with clinico-pathological features and clinical outcome. Loss of ATF-2 diminished the growth-inhibitory effects of tamoxifen, while tamoxifen treatment induced ATF-2 phosphorylation within the AD, to regulate the expression of a set of 227 genes for proximal phospho-ATF-2 binding, involved in cell development, assembly and survival. Low expression of both ATF-2 and pATF-2-Thr71 was significantly associated with aggressive pathological features. Furthermore, pATF-2 was associated with both p-p38 and pJNK1/2 (&lt;&nbsp;0.0001). While expression of ATF-2 is not associated with outcome, pATF-2 is associated with longer disease-free (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002) and BC-specific survival in patients exposed to tamoxifen (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.01). Furthermore, multivariate analysis confirmed pATF-2-Thr71 as an independent prognostic factor. ATF-2 is important for modulating the effect of tamoxifen and phosphorylation of ATF-2 within the AD at Thr71 predicts for improved outcome for ER-positive BC receiving tamoxife.
the liver is generally considered the main site of production of FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor-21), high FGF21 levels have been found to be associated with neuromuscular mitochondrial genetic diseases, and there are indications that the muscle may be a relevant site of FGF21 production under conditions of muscular mitochondrial stress. In the present study, we found that expression and release of FGF21 was associated with myogenic differentiation, and we identified MyoD as a major controller of FGF21 gene transcription. Mimicking mitochondrial dysfunction using respiratory chain/oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors resulted in enhanced expression and release of FGF21 by muscle cells. The increased production of reactive oxygen species, subsequent induction of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and activation of an ATF2 (activating transcription factor 2)-binding site at the proximal promoter region of the FGF21 gene was found to be a major mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction with enhanced FGF21 gene transcription in myogenic cells. The myogenic factor MyoD was required for the induction of FGF21 gene transcription by mitochondrial dysfunction, thus explaining the preferential response of muscle cells to mitochondrial dysfunction-induced FGF21 expression and secretion. FGF21 release by muscle cells in response to mitochondrial alterations may represent a physiological mechanism by which the sensing of internal energetic status by muscles results in the release of FGF21 to favour systemic metabolic adaptation.
stance is one of the obstacles to the effective radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Soluble factors in the tumour microenvironment are often implicated in radioresistance but the underpinning mechanism(s) remain largely elusive. We herein studied the wholesome effect of autocrine cytokines and growth factors in the form of self-conditioned medium (CM) on the radiosensitivity of A549 cells. A549 cells grown in CM exhibited radioresistance which was associated with increased survival and DNA repair. CM induced pro-survival pathways through increased intracellular cAMP and phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Downstream to JNK/p38 signalling, ATF-2 phosphorylated at Thr69/71 was accompanied with its increased transcriptional activity in CM treated cells. Pre-treatment with cAMP inhibitor and silencing of ATF-2 abrogated the CM-induced survival. Interestingly, in cells treated with CM followed by radiation, ATF-2 was found to be switched over from transcription factor to DNA damage response protein. In CM treated cells, after γ-radiation p-ATF-2(Thr69/71) and subsequently the transcriptional activity of ATF-2 were declined with simultaneous rise in p-ATF-2(Ser490/498). Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting and inhibitor studies showed that phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Ser490/498 was mediated by ATM. Moreover, p-ATF-2(Ser490/498) was found to be co-localised with γ-H2AX in DNA repair foci in CM-treated cells. The DNA repair activity of ATF-2 was assisted with higher activity MRN complex in cells grown in CM. Our study revealed that, autocrine soluble factors regulate dual but differential role of ATF-2 as a transcription factor or DNA repair protein, which collectively culminate in radioresistance of A549 cell.
iews on the control of IL-23 production focus on the regulation of il23a, the gene encoding IL-23 p19, by NF-κB in combination with other transcription factors. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), X2-Box-binding protein 1 (XBP1), activator protein 1 (AP1), SMAD, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ), and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) have been involved in response to LPS, but no data are available regarding the mechanism triggered by the fungal mimic and β-glucan-containing stimulus zymosan, which produces IL-23 and to a low extent the related cytokine IL-12 p70. Zymosan induced the mobilization of CHOP from the nuclear fractions to phagocytic vesicles. Hypha-forming Candida also induced the nuclear disappearance of CHOP. Assay of transcription factor binding to the il23a promoter showed an increase of Thr(P)-71-Thr(P)-69-activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) binding in response to zymosan. PKC and PKA/mitogen- and stress-activated kinase inhibitors down-regulated Thr(P)-71-ATF2 binding to the il23a promoter and il23a mRNA expression. Consistent with the current concept of complementary phosphorylations on N-terminal Thr-71 and Thr-69 of ATF2 by ERK and p38 MAPK, MEK, and p38 MAPK inhibitors blunted Thr(P)-69-ATF2 binding. Knockdown of atf2 mRNA with siRNA correlated with inhibition of il23a mRNA, but it did not affect the expression of il12/23b and il10 mRNA. These data indicate the following: (i) zymosan decreases nuclear proapoptotic CHOP, most likely by promoting its accumulation in phagocytic vesicles; (ii) zymosan-induced il23a mRNA expression is best explained through coordinated κB- and ATF2-dependent transcription; and (iii) il23a expression relies on complementary phosphorylation of ATF2 on Thr-69 and Thr-71 dependent on PKC and MAPK activitie.
endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) regulates many aspects of vascular physiology. VEGF-A stimulates signal transduction pathways that modulate endothelial outputs such as cell migration, proliferation, tubulogenesis, and cell-cell interactions. Multiple VEGF-A isoforms exist, but the biological significance of this is unclear. Here we analyzed VEGF-A isoform-specific stimulation of VCAM-1 gene expression, which controls endothelial-leukocyte interactions, and show that this is dependent on both ERK1/2 and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). VEGF-A isoforms showed differential ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation kinetics. A key feature of VEGF-A isoform-specific ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation was increased phosphorylation of ATF-2 on threonine residue 71 (T71). Using reverse genetics, we showed ATF-2 to be functionally required for VEGF-A-stimulated endothelial VCAM-1 gene expression. ATF-2 knockdown blocked VEGF-A-stimulated VCAM-1 expression and endothelial-leukocyte interactions. ATF-2 was also required for other endothelial cell outputs, such as cell migration and tubulogenesis. In contrast, VCAM-1 was essential only for promoting endothelial-leukocyte interactions. This work presents a new paradigm for understanding how soluble growth factor isoforms program complex cellular outputs and responses by modulating signal transduction pathway.
lar endothelium is specifically sensitive to oxidative stress, and this is one of the mechanisms that causes widespread endothelial dysfunction in most cardiovascular diseases and disorders. Protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage via antioxidant mechanisms is essential for tissue maintenance and shows therapeutic potential for patients suffering from cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Salvianolic acid B (SalB), a natural bioactive component known from Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been reported to exert cellular protection in various types of cells. However, the underlying mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here, we showed that SalB significantly promoted the migratory and tube formation abilities of human bone marrow derived-endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs) in vitro, and substantially abrogated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell damage. SalB down-regulated Nox4 and eNOS, as well as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase expression upon H2O2 induction that in turn prevents oxidative-induced endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, SalB suppressed the Bax/Bcl-xL ratio and caspase-3 activation after H2O2 induction. Furthermore, our results provide mechanistic evidence that activation of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathways is required for both SalB-mediated angiogenic and protective effects against oxidative stress-induced cell injury in BM-EPCs. Suppression of MKK3/6-p38 MAPK-ATF2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways by SalB significantly protected BM-EPCs against cell injury caused by oxidative stress via reduction of intracellular ROS levels and apoptosis. Taken together, by providing a mechanistic insight into the modulation of redox states in BM-EPCs by SalB, we suggest that SalB has a strong potential of being a new proangiogenic and cytoprotective therapeutic agent with applications in the field of endothelial injury-mediated vascular disease.
d Ginseng (KRG) is one of the representative traditional herbal medicines prepared from Panax ginseng Meyer (Araliaceae) in Korea. It has been reported that KRG exhibits a lot of different biological actions such as anti-aging, anti-fatigue, anti-stress, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. Although systematic studies have investigated how KRG is able to ameliorate various inflammatory diseases, its molecular inhibitory mechanisms had not been carried out prior to this stud.
to investigate these mechanisms, we evaluated the effects of a water extract of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG-WE) on the in vitro inflammatory responses of activated RAW264.7 cells, and on in vivo gastritis and peritonitis models by analyzing the activation events of inflammation-inducing transcription factors and their upstream kinase.
duced the production of nitric oxide (NO), protected cells against NO-induced apoptosis, suppressed mRNA levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and interferon (IFN)-β, ameliorated EtOH/HCl-induced gastritis, and downregulated peritoneal exudate-derived NO production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice. The inhibition of these inflammatory responses by KRG-WE was regulated through the suppression of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and by subsequent inhibition of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and IRF-3 activation. Of ginsensides included in this extract, interestingly, G-Rc showed the highest inhibitory potency on IRF-3-mediated luciferase activit.
ults strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory activities of KRG-WE could be due to its inhibition of the p38/JNK/TBK1 activation pathwa.
of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or activation of alternative pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, are involved in acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors which represent the first-line treatment of BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma. We recently demonstrated that 6-((7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)hexan-1-ol (NBDHEX) and its water soluble analog 2-(2-(2-((7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol (MC3181) trigger apoptosis in BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cells through activation of the MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Herein, we investigated whether NBDHEX and MC3181 might exert antitumor activity against BRAF V600E mutated human melanoma cells rendered resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. To this aim we generated a subline of A375 melanoma resistant in vitro and in vivo to vemurafenib (A375-VR8) and characterized by NRAS G13R mutation, high basal levels of CRAF protein and phospho-activation of AKT. In these cells ERK phosphorylation was not significantly down-modulated by vemurafenib concentrations capable of abrogating ERK phosphorylation in sensitive A375 cells. Both NBDHEX and MC3181 induced marked antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in A375-VR8 cells and, at equitoxic concentrations, caused a strong phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and of the downstream mediators of apoptosis ATF2 and p53. Drug treatment further increased ERK phosphorylation, which was required for the cellular response to the NBD derivatives, as apoptosis was antagonized by the ERK inhibitor FR180204. Finally, in vivo administration of MC3181 provoked JNK activation at the tumor site and markedly reduced A375-VR8 growth. These evidences strongly suggest that the activation of multiple pro-apoptotic MAPK pathways by MC3181 might represent a new strategy for the treatment of melanoma resistant to BRAF inhibitor.
issue levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and functional impairment of endothelium are frequently observed in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The vascular endothelium is specifically sensitive to oxidative stress, and this is one of the mechanisms that causes widespread endothelial dysfunction in most cardiovascular diseases and disorders. Hence attention has increasingly been paid to enhance mobilization and differentiation of EPCs for therapeutic purposes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Icariin, a natural bioactive component known from traditional Chinese Medicine, can induce angiogenic differentiation and inhibit oxidative stress-induced cell dysfunction in bone marrow-derived EPCs (BM-EPCs), and, if so, through what mechanisms. We observed that treatment of BM-EPCs with Icariin significantly promoted cell migration and capillary tube formation, substantially abrogated hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 )-induced apoptotic and autophagic programmed cell death that was linked to the reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and restored mitochondrial membrane potential. Icariin downregulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3, as well as nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase expression upon H2 O2 induction. These antiapoptotic and antiautophagic effects of Icariin are possibly mediated by restoring the loss of mammalian target of rapamycin /p70S6K/4EBP1 phosphorylation as well as attenuation of ATF2 and ERK1/2 protein levels after H2 O2 treatment. In summary, favorable modulation of the angiogenesis and redox states in BM-EPCs make Icariin a promising proangiogenic agent both enhancing vasculogenesis and protecting against endothelial dysfunctio.
PINCH, Parvin (IPP) complex regulates adhesion and migration via binding of ILK to β1 integrin and α-parvin thus linking focal adhesions to actin cytoskeleton. ILK also binds the adaptor protein PINCH which connects signaling proteins including Rsu1 to the complex. A recent study of Rsu1 and PINCH1 in non-transformed MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells revealed that the siRNA-mediated depletion of either Rsu1 or PINCH1 decreased the number of focal adhesions (FAs) and altered the distribution and localization of FA proteins. This correlated with reduced adhesion, failure to spread or migrate in response to EGF and a loss of actin stress fibers and caveolae. The depletion of Rsu1 caused significant reduction in PINCH1 implying that Rsu1 may function in part by regulating levels of PINCH1. However, Rsu1, but not PINCH1, was required for EGF-induced activation of p38 Map kinase and ATF2 phosphorylation, suggesting a Rsu1 function independent from the IPP complex. Reconstitution of Rsu1-depleted cells with a Rsu1 mutant (N92D) that does not bind to PINCH1 failed to restore FAs or migration but did promote IPP-independent spreading and constitutive as well as EGF-induced p38 activation. In this commentary we discuss p38 activity in adhesion and how Rsu1 expression may be linked to Map kinase kinase (MKK) activation and detachment-induced stress kinase signalin.
ch is a nuclear protein harboring an AT-hook domain and 18-repeats of C2H2 zinc-finger motif, is highly expressed in immune-related tissues, including the thymus and spleen. T cell specific deletion of the Zfat gene by crossing Zfat(f/f) mice with LckCre mice yields a significant reduction in the number of CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes. However, physiological role for Zfat in T cell development in the thymus remains unknown. Here, we found that Zfat-deficient DP thymocytes in Zfat(f/f)-LckCre mice were susceptible to apoptosis both at an unstimulated state and in response to T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation. The phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK were elevated in Zfat-deficient thymocytes at an unstimulated state with an enhanced phosphorylation of ATF2 and with an over-expression of Gadd45α⋅ On the other hand, the activation of JNK in the Zfat-deficient thymocytes, but not p38, was strengthened and prolonged in response to TCR-stimulation. All these results demonstrate that Zfat critically participates in the development of DP thymocytes through regulating the activities of p38 and JN.
rosis factor-(TNF-)-α upregulates plasminogen activator inhibitor-(PAI-) 1 expression in pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs), contributing to fibrin deposition and pleural fibrosis. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been found implicated in fibrogenesis. However, the roles of TNF-α or HDAC in the regulation of PAI-1 expression have not been well investigated. We aimed to examine the effects and mechanisms of HDAC inhibition on TNF-α-induced PAI-1 expression in human PMCs. MeT-5A human PMCs were treated with TNF-α in the presence or absence of the m-carboxycinnamic acid bishydroxamide (CBHA), an HDAC class II inhibitor, and the HDAC activity, PAI-1 protein expression, mRNA, and activated signalings were analyzed. CBHA abrogated TNF-α-induced HDAC activity, PAI-1 protein and, mRNA expression in MeT-5A cells. Moreover, CBHA significantly enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-(MKP-) 5/MKP-1 expression and inhibited p38/JNK activations, ATF2/c-Jun translocation, and PAI-1 promoter activity. Altogether, our data suggest that HDAC inhibition may abrogate TNF-α-activated MAPK/AP-1 signaling and PAI-1 expression in human PMCs. Given the antifibrotic effect through PAI-1 abrogation, CBHA may be utilized as a novel agent in the treatment of fibrotic disease.
tivated protein kinase-3 (SAPK3), a recently described MAP kinase family member with a wide-spread tissue distribution, was transfected into several mammalian cell lines and shown to be activated in response to cellular stresses, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in a similar manner to SAPK1 (also termed JNK) and SAPK2 (also termed p38, RK, CSBP and Mxi2). SAPK3 and SAPK2 were activated at similar rates in vitro by SAPKK3 (also termed MKK6), and SAPKK3 was the only activator of SAPK3 that was induced when KB or 293 cells were exposed to cellular stresses or stimulated with IL-1 or TNF. Co-transfection with SAPKK3 induced SAPK3 activity and greatly enhanced activation in response to osmotic shock. These experiments indicate that SAPKK3 mediates the activation of SAPK3 in several mammalian cells. SAPK3 and SAPK2 phosphorylated a number of proteins at similar rates, including the transcription factors ATF2, Elk-1 and SAP1, but SAPK3 was far less effective than SAPK2 in activating MAPKAP kinase-2 and MAPKAP kinase-3. Unlike SAPK2, SAPK3 was not inhibited by the drug SB 203580. SAPK3 phosphorylated ATF2 at Thr69, Thr71 and Ser90, the same residues phosphorylated by SAPK1, whereas SAPK2 only phosphorylated Thr69 and Thr71. Our results suggest that cellular functions previously attributed to SAPK1 and/or SAPK2 may be mediated by SAPK.
 (E2) and the naturally occurring polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) play important roles in breast cancer cell growth and differentiation. We examined the effects of E2 and spermine on the phosphorylation and DNA binding of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. ATF-2 is a transcription factor involved in estrogenic regulation of cyclin D1 gene, and thereby cell cycle progression. DNA affinity immunoblot assays showed a six- to eightfold increase in the binding of ATF-2 to a 74-mer ATF/CRE oligonucleotide (ODN1) from cyclin D1 promoter in the presence of 4 nM E2 and 0.5 mM spermine, compared to untreated control. Individual treatments with E2 or spermine caused a twofold or lower increase in ATF-2 binding to ODN1. Immunoblotting with phospho-ATF-2 antibody showed that increased DNA binding of ATF-2 was associated with its phosphorylation. A p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, PD169316, inhibited ATF-2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, or the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, had no significant effect on DNA binding of ATF-2. Cyclin D1 promoter (-1745CD1) activity increased by approximately 12-fold (above control) in the presence of E2 and spermine, compared to a sixfold increase in the presence of E2 alone and a twofold increase with spermine. Cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of ATF-2 showed decreased transactivation of cyclin D1 promoter in response to E2 and spermine. These results indicate that spermine can enhance E2-induced cell signaling and cyclin D1 transcription by activation of the p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylation of ATF-2, contributing to breast cancer cell proliferatio.
 responses can be triggered by the cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-I that binds to viral RNA. RIG-I-mediated signaling stimulates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB and their activation mechanisms have been intensively studied. Here we examined Sendai virus (SV)-mediated activation of the transcription factor CREB and the role of its feedback repressor ICER in production of endogenous antiviral proteins. We show that SV infection and the mitochondrial adapter protein MAVS promote CREB phosphorylation that is dependent upon p38 MAPK and MK2. ICER is induced by CREB and acts as a feedback repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. We found that SV infection stimulated induction of ICER mRNA and protein expression. Surprisingly, ectopic expression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ICER revealed that ICER is a positive regulator of the production of antiviral IFN-β and IP10 during SV infection. In contrast, ICER did not affect SV-elicited phosphorylation of IRF3, NF-κB or ATF2/c-Jun, transcription factors governing IFN-β and IP10 synthesis. However, expression of ICER increased total IRF3 protein levels during SV infection. These results point to a novel role of ICER in antiviral immune signaling acting to increase levels of antiviral effector.
 IRF3, and HMGI recognize a composite regulatory element within the interferon-β enhancer (IFNb). Cooperative ATF2-Jun-IRF3 complex formation at IFNb has been proposed to require a fixed orientation of ATF2-Jun binding. Our results show that ATF2-Jun heterodimers bound IFNb in both orientations alone and in association with IRF3 and HMGI. Two sets of symmetrically located amino acid residues in ATF2 and Jun facilitated the interactions between heterodimers bound in opposite orientations and IRF3 at IFNb. IRF3 and HMGI bound IFNb in association with both orientations of ATF2-Jun heterodimers with the same cooperativity. ATF2-Jun heterodimers that bound IFNb in opposite orientations in vitro had different effects on interferon-β gene transcription when they were co-expressed with IRF3 in cultured cells. These heterodimers had different transcriptional activities at different endogenous genes. Different regions of ATF2 and Jun mediated their orientation-dependent transcriptional activities at different genes. These studies revealed that cooperative DNA binding does not require a unique nucleoprotein complex configuration, and that transcription factor complexes that bind the same enhancer in different configurations can have different transcriptional activitie.
oduced by dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, plays a critical role in innate immunity against bacterial infection. Our previous studies show that morphine disrupts the IL-23/IL-17 mediated pulmonary mucosal host defense and increases susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection. To determine the mechanism by which morphine modulates IL-23 production, mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages (BMDMs) were treated with morphine, and infected with S. pneumoniae or stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Nod2 ligands. We found that a significant increase in IL-23 protein production was observed in S. pneumoniae, TLR2 ligand lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and TLR4 ligand pneumolysin (PLY) stimulated BMDCs and BMDMs. Interestingly, although Nod2 ligand muramyldipeptide (MDP) alone had no effect on IL-23 production, it potentiated LTA induced IL-23 production to the same level as that observed following S. pneumoniae infection, suggesting that S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 production in DCs involves activation of both TLR2 and Nod2 signaling mechanisms. Furthermore, pretreatment of DCs with MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1/4 inhibitors, or TLR2 antibody diminished the S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 and abolished the inhibitory effects of morphine, indicating that S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 production depends on activation of the TLR2-MyD88-IRAK1/4 signaling pathway. Moreover, morphine decreased S. pneumoniae induced phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and activating transcription factor 2 in DCs. Taken together, our study shows that morphine impairs S. pneumoniae induced IL-23 production through MyD88-IRAK1/4-dependent TLR2 and Nod2 signaling in DC.
of interferon-beta enhanceosome from its individual protein components and of enhancer DNA has been studied in solution using a combination of fluorescence anisotropy, microcalorimetry, and CD titration. It was shown that the enhancer binds only one full-length phosphomimetic IRF-3 dimer at the PRDIII-PRDI sites, and this binding does not exhibit cooperativity with binding of the ATF-2/c-Jun bZIP (leucine zipper dimer with basic DNA recognition segments) heterodimer at the PRDIV site. The orientation of the bZIP pair is, therefore, not determined by the presence of the IRF-3 dimer, but is predetermined by the asymmetry of the PRDIV site. In contrast, bound IRF-3 dimer interacts strongly with the NF-kappaB (p50/p65) heterodimer bound at the neighboring PRDII site. The orientation of bound NF-kappaB is also predetermined by the asymmetry of the PRDII site and is the opposite of that found in the crystal structure. The HMG-I/Y protein, proposed as orchestrating enhanceosome assembly, interacts specifically with the PRDII site of the interferon-beta enhancer by inserting its DNA-binding segments (AT hooks) into the minor groove, resulting in a significant increase in NF-kappaB binding affinity for the major groove of this sit.
/p40, produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, is critical for development of Th17 in several autoimmune diseases. In this study, bone marrow-derived (BMM) and splenic macrophages (SPM) from SJL/J mice, susceptible to autoimmune demyelinating disease following Theiler's virus (TMEV) infection, expressed IL-23 in response to TMEV. We identified potential binding sites for IFN response factor (IRF)-3 (nt -734 to -731), Sma- and Mad-related protein (SMAD)-3 (nt -584 to -581), activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 (nt -571 to -568), IRF-7 (nt -533 to-525), and NF-kappaB (nt -215 to -209) in the murine p19 promoter. The p19(prom) in the pGL3 promoter-reporter vector responded to TMEV or poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. Deletions upstream from the IRF-3 site and mutations at the IRF-3, SMAD-3, ATF-2, or NF-kappaB, but not the IRF-7, sites significantly reduced promoter activity. ATF-2 or SMAD-3, but not IRF-3, short-hairpin RNA reduced p19 promoter activity and protein expression in RAW264.7 cells responding to TMEV. Chromosomal DNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SMAD-3 and ATF-2 bind to the endogenous p19 promoter in RAW264.7 cells and SJL/J SPM following challenge with TMEV. TGF-beta1, which activates SMAD-3, was induced in RAW264.7 cells, BMM, and SPM by TMEV. Neutralizing Ab to TGF-beta1 eliminated TMEV-induced IL-23 production and SMAD-3 activation in RAW264.7 cells, BMM, and SPM. Activation of ATF-2 was JNK, but not p38 or ERK MAPK dependent. Inhibition of the JNK, but also the ERK MAPK pathways decreased expression of p19. These results suggest that ATF-2 and SMAD-3 are transcription factors, which are, in addition to NF-kappaB, essential for IL-23 p19 expressio.
nvestigated beta interferon (IFN-beta) and IFN-alpha4 gene expression and activation of related transcription factors in mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-infected fibroblasts. mRNA analysis demonstrated an initial phase of IFN gene induction upon MCMV infection, which was followed by a sustained MCMV-mediated simultaneous downregulation of IFN-beta and IFN-alpha4 gene expression. The induction of IFN transcription resulted from the activation of the components of the IFN-beta enhanceosome, i.e. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 and c-Jun. Activation of the transcription factors occurred rapidly and in a sequential order upon infection, but only lasted a while. As a consequence, IFN-alpha/beta gene expression became undetectable 6 h post-infection and throughout the MCMV replication cycle. This effect is based on an active interference since restimulation of IFN gene induction by further external stimuli (e.g. Sendai virus infection) was completely abolished. This inhibition required MCMV gene expression and was not observed in cells infected with UV-inactivated MCMV virions. The efficiency of inhibition is achieved by a concerted blockade of IkappaBalpha degradation and a lack of nuclear accumulation of IRF3 and ATF-2/c-Jun. Using an MCMV mutant lacking pM27, a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 2-specific inhibitor of Jak/STAT signalling, we found that the initial phase of IFN induction and the subsequent inhibition does not depend on the positive-IFN feedback loop. Our findings indicate that the MCMV-mediated downregulation of IFN transcription in fibroblasts relies on a large arsenal of inhibitory mechanisms targeting each pathway that contributes to the multiprotein enhanceosome comple.
monocytogenes is a prototypic bacterium for studying innate and adaptive cellular immunity as well as host defense. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages, we report that an infection with a wild-type strain, but not a listeriolysin O-deficient strain, of the Gram-positive bacterium L. monocytogenes induces expression of IFN-beta and a bioactive type I IFN response. Investigating the activation of signaling pathways in human macrophages after infection revealed that a wild-type strain and a hemolysin-deficient strain of L. monocytogenes activated the NF-kappaB pathway and induced a comparable TNF response. p38 MAPK and activating transcription factor 2 were phosphorylated following infection with either strain, and IFN-beta gene expression induced by wild-type L. monocytogenes was reduced when p38 was inhibited. However, neither IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 translocation to the nucleus nor posttranslational modifications and dimerizations were observed after L. monocytogenes infection. In contrast, vesicular stomatitis virus and LPS triggered IRF3 activation and signaling. When IRF3 was knocked down using small interfering RNA, a L. monocytogenes-induced IFN-beta response remained unaffected whereas a vesicular stomatitis virus-triggered response was reduced. Evidence against the possibility that IRF7 acts in place of IRF3 is provided. Thus, we show that wild-type L. monocytogenes induced an IFN-beta response in human macrophages and propose that this response involves p38 MAPK and activating transcription factor 2. Using various stimuli, we show that IRF3 is differentially activated during type I IFN responses in human macrophage.
I interferon (IFN) response requires the coordinated activation of the latent transcription factors NF-kappaB, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and ATF-2, which in turn activate transcription from the IFN-beta promoter. Synthesis and subsequent secretion of IFN-beta activate the Jak/STAT signaling pathway, resulting in the transcriptional induction of the full spectrum of antiviral gene products. We utilized high-density microarrays to examine the transcriptional response to rhinovirus type 14 (RV14) infection in HeLa cells, with particular emphasis on the type I interferon response and production of IFN-beta. We found that, although RV14 infection results in altered levels of a wide variety of host mRNAs, induction of IFN-beta mRNA or activation of the Jak/STAT pathway is not seen. Prior work has shown, and our results have confirmed, that NF-kappaB and ATF-2 are activated following infection. Since many viruses are known to target IRF-3 to inhibit the induction of IFN-beta mRNA, we analyzed the status of IRF-3 in infected cells. IRF-3 was translocated to the nucleus and phosphorylated in RV14-infected cells. Despite this apparent activation, very little homodimerization of IRF-3 was evident following infection. Similar results in A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells demonstrated the biological relevance of these findings to RV14 pathogenesis. In addition, prior infection of cells with RV14 prevented the induction of IFN-beta mRNA following treatment with double-stranded RNA, indicating that RV14 encodes an activity that specifically inhibits this innate host defense pathway. Collectively, these results indicate that RV14 infection inhibits the host type I interferon response by interfering with IRF-3 activatio.
tional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y). These factors cooperatively bind a composite DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene. The 3.0 A crystal structure of the DNA-binding domains of ATF-2/c-Jun and two IRF-3 molecules in a complex with 31 base pairs (bp) of the PRDIV-PRDIII region of the IFN-beta enhancer shows that association of the four proteins with DNA creates a continuous surface for the recognition of 24 bp. The structure, together with in vitro binding studies and protein mutagenesis, shows that protein-protein interactions are not critical for cooperative binding. Instead, cooperativity arises mainly through nucleotide sequence-dependent structural changes in the DNA that allow formation of complementary DNA conformations. Because the binding sites overlap on the enhancer, the unit of recognition is the entire nucleotide sequence, not the individual subsite.
eric transcription factors, including the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) protein ATF-2-c-jun, are well-characterized components of an enhanceosome that mediates virus induction of the human beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene. Here we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). We demonstrate that correct orientation of the ATF-2-c-jun binding site is required for virus induction of the IFN-beta gene and for IRF-3-dependent activation of a composite ATF-2- c-jun-IRF site in the IFN-beta promoter. We also show that in vitro the DNA-bound ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer adopts a fixed orientation upon the binding of IRF-3 at an adjacent site in the IFN-beta enhancer and that the DNA-binding domain of IRF-3 is sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, we show that the DNA-binding domain of ATF-2 is necessary and sufficient for selective protein-protein interactions with IRF-3. Strikingly, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with IFN-beta reporter constructs reveal that recruitment of IRF-3 to the IFN-beta promoter upon virus infection is dependent on the orientation of the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binding site. These observations demonstrate functional and physical cooperativity between the bZIP and IRF transcription factor families and illustrate the critical role of heterodimeric transcription factors in formation of the IFN-beta enhanceosom.
dentified a virus-activated factor (VAF) that binds to a regulatory element shared by different virus-inducible genes. We provide evidence that VAF contains two members of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcriptional activator proteins (IRF-3 and IRF-7), as well as the transcriptional coactivator proteins p300 and CBP. Remarkably, VAF, as well as recombinant IRF-3 and IRF-7 proteins, binds very weakly to the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene promoter in vitro. However, in virus-infected cells, both proteins are recruited to the endogenous IFN-beta promoter as part of a protein complex that includes ATF-2/c-Jun and NF-kappa B. These observations provide a unique example of the coordinate activation of multiple transcriptional activator proteins and their highly cooperative assembly into a transcriptional enhancer complex in viv.
recognition is a critical function of immune sentinel cells. Naïve macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs) undergo pathogen-directed activation and maturation, and as mature antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they contribute essential functions to both innate and adaptive immunity. Using recombinant adenovirus (rAdV) as a model for murine APC activation by DNA viruses, we demonstrate a critical role for stress kinase activation in cell intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral signaling cascades. We propose two viral triggers, viral capsid and viral DNA, are required for APC activation. Endosomal escape and presentation of cytosolic rAdV DNA induces phosphorylation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) at serine 172 but does not induce IkappaB kinase epsilon activity as determined by in vitro kinase assays. However, induction of TBK1 alone is not sufficient for interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation. We show that capsid-dependent activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stress kinase is a necessary step, licensing TBK1 phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser 396. A second later phase of JNK activity is required to coordinate phosphorylation of JNK-dependent transcription factors (c-Jun/ATF2) with activated IRF3 in the induction of primary IRF3-responsive transcripts. Finally, we demonstrate that maximal JNK/TBK1/IRF3 stimulation by rAdV depends on an intact type I interferon (IFN) signaling cascade. By requiring multiple viral triggers and type I IFN autocrine regulation, APCs have an inherent fail-safe mechanism against inappropriate activation and maturatio.
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes numerous regulatory proteins capable of modulating viral and cellular gene expression and affecting host cell functions. K-bZIP, a leucine zipper-containing transcription factor encoded by ORFK8, is one such protein. During infection, transcription of the ORFK8 early gene is turned on by the immediate-early replication and transcription factor activator (RTA). One described function of the K-bZIP nuclear protein is to interact with and repress RTA-mediated transactivation of viral promoters, including that of the K8 gene. In the present work, we provide evidence that the expression of K-bZIP results in the activation of the ifn-beta gene. Of interest, ifn-beta gene activation by K-bZIP is independent of interferon (IFN)-responsive factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Using a DNA binding affinity assay and electromobility shift assay, we report that K-bZIP binds efficiently to the PRDIII-I region of the beta IFN (IFN-beta) promoter, and, in doing so, it prevents the attachment of activated IRF-3 but not that of NF-kappaB or ATF2/c-Jun to the IFN-beta promoter sequence. As a consequence, ifn-beta gene activation in response to IFN inducers such as Sendai virus infection or expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene I, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, or TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) is severely impaired (&gt;90%) by the presence of K-bZIP. K-bZIP also prevents the activation of RANTES and CXCL11, whose promoters are also regulated by IRF-3. Lysine 158 (target for SUMO conjugation), threonine 111, and serine 167 (targets for phosphorylation) mutants of K-bZIP were equally effective as wild-type K-bZIP in mediating the repression of TBK-1-activated ifn-beta gene expression. Lastly, the overexpression of CREB binding protein could not reverse the K-bZIP repression of TBK-1-activated ifn-beta gene expression. In all, our results indicate that K-bZIP binds directly to the PRDIII-I region of the IFN-beta promoter and, as a consequence, causes a low level of ifn-beta gene transcription. In doing so, K-bZIP prevents IRF-3 from binding to the IFN-beta promoter and precludes the formation of the enhanceosome, which is required for maximal ifn-beta gene transcription. A new role for K-bZIP as a protein involved in immune evasion is therefore uncovere.
e interferon (IFN)-inducible adenosine deaminase acting on RNA, catalyzes the C-6 deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in RNA substrates with a double-stranded character. Because double-stranded RNA is a known inducer of IFN, we tested the role of ADAR1 in IFN induction following virus infection. HeLa cells made stably deficient in ADAR1 (ADAR1(kd)) were compared to vector control (CON(kd)) and protein kinase PKR-deficient (PKR(kd)) cells for IFN-β induction following infection with either parental (wild-type [WT]) recombinant Moraten vaccine strain measles virus (MV) or isogenic knockout mutants deficient for either V (V(ko)) or C (C(ko)) protein expression. We observed potent IFN-β transcript induction in ADAR1(kd) cells by all three viruses; in contrast, in ADAR1-sufficient CON(kd) cells, only the C(ko) mutant virus was an effective inducer and the IFN-β RNA induction was amplified by PKR. The enhanced IFN-β transcript-inducing capacity of the WT and V(ko) viruses seen in ADAR1-deficient cells correlated with the enhanced activation of PKR, IFN regulatory factor IRF3, and activator of transcription ATF2, reaching levels similar to those seen in C(ko) virus-infected cells. However, the level of IFN-β protein produced was not proportional to the level of IFN-β RNA but rather correlated inversely with the level of activated PKR. These results suggest that ADAR1 functions as an important suppressor of MV-mediated responses, including the activation of PKR and IRF3 and the induction of IFN-β RNA. Our findings further implicate a balanced interplay between PKR and ADAR1 in modulating IFN-β protein production following virus infectio.
ccus pneumoniae is a pathogen that causes serious respiratory disease and meningitis in the immunocompromised drug abuse population. However, the precise mechanisms by which drug abuse compromises the host immune defense to pulmonary S. pneumoniae infection is not fully understood. Using a well-established murine model of opiate abuse and S. pneumoniae lung infection, we explored the influence of morphine treatment on the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17 axis and related innate immunity. Impairment of early IL-23/IL-17 production caused by morphine treatment was associated with delayed neutrophil migration and decreased pneumococcal clearance. Furthermore, morphine treatment impaired MyD88-dependent IL-23 production in alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells in response to in vitro S. pneumoniae cell infection. Moreover, morphine treatment significantly inhibited the S. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), ATF2, and NF-kappaBp65. T-cell receptor delta (TCRdelta)-deficient mice showed a decrease in IL-17 production and a severely weakened capacity to clear lung S. pneumoniae infection. Finally, morphine treatment resulted in diminished secretion of antimicrobial proteins S100A9 and S100A8/A9 during early stages of S. pneumoniae infection. In conclusion, morphine treatment causes a dysfunction in IL-23-producing dendritic cells and macrophages and IL-17-producing gammadeltaT lymphocytes in response to S. pneumoniae lung infection. This leads to diminished release of antimicrobial S100A8/A9 proteins, compromised neutrophil recruitment, and more-severe infectio.
ecules that modulate specific protein functions are valuable tools for dissecting complex signaling pathways. Here, we identified a small molecule that induces the assembly of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB. This compound stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), which is a member of a family of proteins involved in stress-mediated signaling pathways. Consistent with this, MEKK1 activates IRF3 in addition to ATF2/c-JUN and NF-kappaB for the assembly of the IFN-beta enhanceosome. MEKK1 activates IRF3 through the c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway but not the p38 and IkappaB kinase (IKK) pathway. Taken together with previous observations, these results implicate that, for the assembly of an IFN-beta enhanceosome, MEKK1 can induce IRF3 and ATF2/c-JUN through the JNK pathway, whereas it can induce NF-kappaB through the IKK pathway. Thus, specific MEKK family proteins may be able to integrate some of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the specific activation of the IFN-beta enhanceosom.
eceptor tyrosine kinase family, Tyro3, Axl and Mer are key to apoptotic cell clearance. Reduced phagocytic clearance in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) leads to prolonged exposure of nuclear autoantigen to the immune system. Here we measure the levels of TAM receptors and the phagocytic capacity of monocytes and macrophages in juvenile-onset SLE (JSLE.
in was measured on monocytes from JSLE, healthy control and JIA patients. JSLE, healthy control and JIA patients' plasma were analysed for soluble Mer (sMer), soluble Tyro3 (sTyro) and soluble Axl (sAxl). A phagocytosis assay measured the effect of JSLE serum on phagocytic potential of JSLE and control monocytes to engulf E. Coli bacteria and healthy macrophages to engulf apoptotic neutrophil.
tor expression was significantly decreased on JSLE monocytes compared to healthy controls. Plasma sMer, sTyro and sAxl were significantly increased in JSLE patients compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Adult healthy control macrophages had significantly decreased phagocytosis of E. Coli and apoptotic neutrophils in the presence of 10% JSLE serum compared to control serum (p &lt; 0.05.
ents have a decreased phagocytosis due to both serum and cell-derived factors. Significantly increased levels of sMer, sTyro3 and sAxl may be important factors contributing to the deficit in phagocytosis abilit.
nflammation is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Specific immune mechanisms and pathways that drive and maintain chronic inflammation in CKD are not well described. The TAM ligands (Gas6 and protein S) and receptors (Axl and Mer) have been recently recognized as playing a prominent role in immune regulation. The receptors exist in both soluble and cell-bound forms; the soluble receptors (sAxl and sMer) are believed to compete with the bound receptors and thus inhibit their function. In this study, we determined the expression of cell-bound and soluble TAM proteins in patients with CKD. CKD patients had significantly lower expression of Mer in monocytes, yet increased expression of soluble TAM receptors sAxl and sMer in plasma compared to controls. The metalloproteinase ADAM 17, responsible for cleavage of Mer to its soluble form, was increased in patient monocytes. Elevated levels of soluble TAM receptors were more evident in patients with progressive renal failure. These observations suggest that functional deficiency of TAM receptor-mediated regulation of inflammation may contribute to chronic inflammation in patients with CK.
nd elimination of the aged photoreceptor outer segment (POS) by RPE cells is a daily rhythmic process that is important for long-term vision. Phagocytic dysfunction results in photoreceptor cell death. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, is known to show neuroprotective effects in stroke, neurological diseases, and retinal degeneration models. In this study, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on retinal phagocytosi.
Hrodo-succinimidyl ester (SE), a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, to label the POS for monitoring phagocytosis. After ingestion, the intensity of pHrodo fluorescence increases because of the pH changes inside the liposome. An RPE cell line, ARPE-19, and primary human RPE cells were used to investigate the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of phagocytosis in the pH-sensitive fluorescence POS phagocytosis assay. Additionally, we examined whether TUDCA could promote phagocytic functio.
sity of pHrodo light emission increased in a time-dependent manner. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid enhanced phagocytosis of POS and protected against H2O2-induced phagocytic dysfunction. It also promoted phagocytic function via activation of Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK), which is known to have a key role in the physiological renewal of PO.
ults suggest that TUDCA activates MerTK, which is important for phagocytosis of POS. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of retinal disease.
in 37 (IL-37) and IL-1R8 (SIGIRR or TIR8) are anti-inflammatory orphan members of the IL-1 ligand family and IL-1 receptor family, respectively. Here we demonstrate formation and function of the endogenous ligand-receptor complex IL-37-IL-1R8-IL-18Rα. The tripartite complex assembled rapidly on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Silencing of IL-1R8 or IL-18Rα impaired the anti-inflammatory activity of IL-37. Whereas mice with transgenic expression of IL-37 (IL-37tg mice) with intact IL-1R8 were protected from endotoxemia, IL-1R8-deficient IL-37tg mice were not. Proteomic and transcriptomic investigations revealed that IL-37 used IL-1R8 to harness the anti-inflammatory properties of the signaling molecules Mer, PTEN, STAT3 and p62(dok) and to inhibit the kinases Fyn and TAK1 and the transcription factor NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, IL-37-IL-1R8 exerted a pseudo-starvational effect on the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTOR. IL-37 thus bound to IL-18Rα and exploited IL-1R8 to activate a multifaceted intracellular anti-inflammatory progra.
f this study was to test the hypothesis whether MERTK, which is up-regulated in human DCs treated with immunosuppressive agents, is directly involved in modulating T cell activation. MERTK is a member of the TAM family and contributes to regulating innate immune response to ACs by inhibiting DC activation in animal models. However, whether MERTK interacts directly with T cells has not been addressed. Here, we show that MERTK is highly expressed on dex-induced human tol-DCs and participates in their tolerogenic effect. Neutralization of MERTK in allogenic MLR, as well as autologous DC-T cell cultures, leads to increased T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. Additionally, we identify a previously unrecognized noncell-autonomous regulatory function of MERTK expressed on DCs. Mer-Fc protein, used to mimic MERTK on DCs, suppresses naïve and antigen-specific memory T cell activation. This mechanism is mediated by the neutralization of the MERTK ligand PROS1. We find that MERTK and PROS1 are expressed in human T cells upon TCR activation and drive an autocrine proproliferative mechanism. Collectively, these results suggest that MERTK on DCs controls T cell activation and expansion through the competition for PROS1 interaction with MERTK in the T cells. In conclusion, this report identified MERTK as a potent suppressor of T cell respons.
xpression of Mer and Axl receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are frequently found in various cancers as known to promote oncogenesis by activating antiapoptotic signaling pathways. However, the roles of these receptors in neuroblastoma remain unclear. We found Mer and Axl was co-expressed in neuroblastoma patient samples and cell lines. Ligand-dependent Mer or Axl activation led to an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2, AKT and FAK indicating roles for these RTKs in multiple oncogenic processes. Furthermore, Mer and Axl knockdown led to apoptosis and inhibition of migration as well as a significant increase in chemosensitivity in response to cisplatin and vincristine treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrated that inhibition of Mer and Axl improved apoptotic response and chemosensitivity in neuroblastoma, providing new insights into development of novel therapeutic strategies by targeting these oncogene.
sis of apoptotic cells by macrophages and spent photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells requires several proteins, including MerTK receptors and associated Gas6 and protein S ligands. In the retina, POS phagocytosis is rhythmic, and MerTK is activated promptly after light onset via the αvβ5 integrin receptor and its ligand MFG-E8, thus generating a phagocytic peak. The phagocytic burst is limited in time, suggesting a down-regulation mechanism that limits its duration. Our previous data showed that MerTK helps control POS binding of integrin receptors at the RPE cell surface as a negative feedback loop. Our present results show that a soluble form of MerTK (sMerTK) is released in the conditioned media of RPE-J cells during phagocytosis and in the interphotoreceptor matrix of the mouse retina during the morning phagocytic peak. In contrast to macrophages, the two cognate MerTK ligands have an opposite effect on phagocytosis and sMerTK release, whereas the integrin ligand MFG-E8 markedly increases both phagocytosis and sMerTK levels. sMerTK acts as a decoy receptor blocking the effect of both MerTK ligands. Interestingly, stimulation of sMerTK release decreases POS binding. Conversely, blocking MerTK cleavage increased mostly POS binding by RPE cells. Therefore, our data suggest that MerTK cleavage contributes to the acute regulation of RPE phagocytosis by limiting POS binding to the cell surfac.
istics of decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) include susceptibility to infection, immuneparesis, and monocyte dysfunction. MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) is expressed by monocytes and macrophages and contributes to down-regulation of innate immune responses. We investigated whether MERTK expression is altered on monocytes from patients with liver failur.
ed blood and liver samples collected from patients admitted to the liver intensive therapy unit at King's College Hospital in London from December 2012 through July 2014. Patients had either ACLF (n&nbsp;= 41), acute decompensation of cirrhosis without ACLF (n&nbsp;= 9), cirrhosis without decompensation (n&nbsp;= 17), or acute liver failure (n&nbsp;= 23). We also analyzed samples from healthy individuals (controls, n&nbsp;= 29). We used flow cytometry to determine the level of innate immune function, and associated the findings with disease severity. We developed an assay to measure recruitment and migration of immune cells from the tissue parenchyma. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to determine levels of MERTK in bone marrow, liver, and lymph node tissues. We performed immunophenotype analyses and measured the production of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 and intracellular killing of Escherichia coli by monocytes and peritoneal macrophages incubated with lipopolysaccharide, with or without an inhibitor of MERTK (UNC569.
r of monocytes and macrophages that expressed MERTK was greatly increased in the circulation, livers, and lymph nodes of patients with ACLF, compared with patients with stable cirrhosis and controls. MERTK expression (mean fluorescence intensity) correlated with the severity of hepatic and extrahepatic disease and systemic inflammatory responses. Based on immunophenotype, migration, and functional analyses, MERTK-expressing monocytes migrate across the endothelia to localize into tissue sites and regional lymph nodes. Expression of MERTK reduced the response of cultured monocytes to lipopolysaccharide; the addition of UNC569 restored production of inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharid.
with ACLF have increased numbers of immunoregulatory monocytes and macrophages that express MERTK and suppress the innate immune response to microbes. The number of these cells correlates with disease severity and the inflammatory response. MERTK inhibitors restore production of inflammatory cytokines by immune cells from patients with ACLF, and might be developed to increase the innate immune response in these patient.
o-phagocytic gene expression patterns during clearance of dying cells in the retina and the effect of triamcinolone (TC) upon these processes have relevance to development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD.
ells and primary human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE) were induced to undergo cell death by anoikis and the clearance of these cells by living hRPE/ARPE-19 or human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) in the presence or absence of TC was quantified by flow cytometry. TaqMan low-density gene expression array determining known markers of phagocytosis and loss-of-function studies on selected apopto-phagocytic genes was carried out in HMDM engulfing anoikic cell.
corticoid TC had a profound phagocytosis-enhancing effect on HMDM engulfing anoikic ARPE-19 or hRPE cells, causing a selective upregulation of the Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK) receptor, while decreasing the expression of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase and thrombospondin-1 (THSB-1). The key role of the MERTK could be demonstrated in HMDM engulfing dying cells using gene silencing as well as blocking antibodies. Similar pathways were found upregulated in living ARPE-19 engulfing anoikic ARPE-19 cells. Gas6 treatment enhanced phagocytosis in TC-treated HMDM.
agonists of the Mertk receptor may have a potential role as phagocytosis enhancers in the retina and serve as future targets for AMD therap.
f Gas6 as enhancer of retinal phagocytosis via the MerTK receptor, alone or in combination with other specific ligands of the tyrosine kinase receptors' family may have a potential role in AMD therap.
with t(1;19)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are prone to central nervous system (CNS) relapses, and expression of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) receptor Mer is upregulated in these leukemias. We examined the functional role of Mer in the CNS in preclinical models and performed correlative studies in 64 t(1;19)-positive and 93 control pediatric ALL patients. ALL cells were analyzed in coculture with human glioma cells and normal rat astrocytes: CNS coculture caused quiescence and protection from methotrexate toxicity in Mer(high) ALL cell lines, which was antagonized by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Mer. Mer expression was upregulated, prosurvival Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling were activated, and secretion of the Mer ligand Galectin-3 was stimulated. Mer(high) t(1;19) primary cells caused CNS involvement to a larger extent in murine xenografts than in their Mer(low) counterparts. Leukemic cells from Mer(high) xenografts showed enhanced survival in coculture. Treatment of Mer(high) patient cells with the Mer-specific inhibitor UNC-569 in vivo delayed leukemia onset, reduced CNS infiltration, and prolonged survival of mice. Finally, a correlation between high Mer expression and CNS positivity upon initial diagnosis was observed in t(1;19) patients. Our data provide evidence that Mer is associated with survival in the CNS in t(1;19)-positive ALL, suggesting a role as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic targe.
sses of targeted therapeutics against EGFR and ALK in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have demonstrated the substantial survival gains made possible by precision therapy. However, the majority of patients do not have tumors with genetic alterations responsive to these therapies, and therefore identification of new targets is needed. Our laboratory previously identified MER receptor tyrosine kinase as one such potential target. We now report our findings targeting MER with a clinically translatable agent--Mer590, a monoclonal antibody specific for MER. Mer590 rapidly and robustly reduced surface and total MER levels in multiple cell lines. Treatment reduced surface MER levels by 87%, and this effect was maximal within four hours. Total MER levels were also dramatically reduced, and this persisted for at least seven days. Mechanistically, MER down-regulation was mediated by receptor internalization and degradation, leading to inhibition of downstream signaling through STAT6, AKT, and ERK1/2. Functionally, this resulted in increased apoptosis, increased chemosensitivity to carboplatin, and decreased colony formation. In addition to carboplatin, Mer590 interacted cooperatively with shRNA-mediated MER inhibition to augment apoptosis. These data demonstrate that MER inhibition can be achieved with a monoclonal antibody in NSCLC. Optimization toward a clinically available anti-MER antibody is warrante.
e is a novel therapeutic target for many cancers, and overexpression of Mer receptor tyrosine kinase has been observed in several kinds of tumors. To deeply understand the structure-activity correlation of a series of pyridine/pyrimidine analogs as potent Mer inhibitors, a combined molecular docking and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling was carried out. A comparative molecular similarity indices analysis model was developed based on the maximum common substructure alignment. The optimum model exhibited statistically significant results: the cross-validated correlation coefficient q2 was 0.599, and non-cross-validated r2 value was 0.984. Furthermore, the results of internal validation such as bootstrapping, Y-randomization as well as external validation (the external predictive correlation coefficient r2 ext = 0.728) confirmed the rationality and good predictive ability of the model. Using the crystal structure of Mer kinase, the selected pyridine/pyrimidine compounds were docked into the enzyme active site. Some key amino acid residues were determined, and hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between Mer kinase and inhibitors were identified. The satisfactory results from this study may aid in the research and development of novel potent Mer kinase inhibitor.
em cells, whose major reservoir in the adult mammalian brain is the subventricular zone (SVZ), ensure neuropoiesis, a process during which many generated cells die. Removal of dead cells and debris by phagocytes is necessary for tissue homeostasis. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that cultured SVZ cells phagocytose both 1 and 2 µm latex beads and apoptotic cell-derived fragments. We determine by flow cytometry that phagocytic cells represent more than 10% of SVZ cultured cells. Phenotyping of SVZ cells using nestin, GFAP, Sox2, or LeX/SSEA and quantification of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, reveals that cells with neural stem-cell features phagocytose and represent more than 30% of SVZ phagocytic cells. In vivo, nestin-, Sox2-, and ALDH-expressing neural stem-like cells engulfed latex beads or apoptotic cell-derived fragments that were injected into mice lateral brain ventricles. We show also that SVZ cell phagocytic activity is an active process, which depends both on cytoskeleton dynamic and on recognition of phosphatidylserine eat-me signal, and is stimulated by the vitamin K-dependent factor protein S (ProS). ProS neutralizing antibodies inhibit SVZ cell phagocytic activity and exposure of SVZ cells to apoptotic cell-derived fragments induces a transient Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK) phosphorylation. Conversely, MerTK blocking antibodies impair both basal and ProS-stimulated SVZ cell phagocytic activity. By revealing that neural stem-like cells act within the SVZ neurogenic niche as phagocytes and that the ProS/MerTK path represents an endogenous regulatory mechanism for SVZ cell phagocytic activity, the present report opens-up new perspectives for both stem cell biology and brain physiopatholog.
ine if IL-17 regulates Mer tyrosine kinase-positive (MerTK+) cells in Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratiti.
in 17 was tested in normal and infected cornea of susceptible C57BL/6 and resistant BALB/c mice. The latter were treated with recombinant mouse (rm) IL-17; both groups were treated with IL-17 neutralizing antibody. Mice were infected, and clinical score, PCR, ELISA, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays tested expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators and polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte (PMN) infiltrate. Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) protein levels were assessed in both mouse strains, while MerTK+ cells were examined by immunostaining and cell sorting before and after IL-17 neutralizatio.
 mRNA and protein were higher in C57BL/6 versus BALB/c cornea after infection. The rmIL-17 treatment of BALB/c mice modified proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, but clinical score and MPO assay revealed no differences. However, only BALB/c mice treated with IL-17 neutralizing antibody showed increased disease, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 2, and MPO levels. Fas and FasL protein levels, elevated earlier in BALB/c versus C57BL/6 mice, correlated with significantly more MerTK+ cells in BALB/c cornea at 3 days after infection. Neutralization of IL-17 in C57BL/6 mice elevated MerTK+ cells, while similar treatment of BALB/c mice significantly decreased the.
a provide evidence that IL-17 expression is higher in C57BL/6 versus BALB/c cornea after infection and that the latter group has more MerTK+ cells. Exogenous rmIL-17 failed to shift the disease response in resistant mice, but its neutralization resulted in worsened disease and reduced MerTK+ cells. Neutralization of IL-17 in C57BL/6 mice increased MerTK+ cells but did not dramatically shift the disease respons.
eceptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl, and Mer regulate key features of cellular physiology, yet the differential activities of the TAM ligands Gas6 and Protein S are poorly understood. We have used biochemical and genetic analyses to delineate the rules for TAM receptor-ligand engagement and find that the TAMs segregate into two groups based on ligand specificity, regulation by phosphatidylserine, and function. Tyro3 and Mer are activated by both ligands but only Gas6 activates Axl. Optimal TAM signaling requires coincident TAM ligand engagement of both its receptor and the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer): Gas6 lacking its PtdSer-binding 'Gla domain' is significantly weakened as a Tyro3/Mer agonist and is inert as an Axl agonist, even though it binds to Axl with wild-type affinity. In two settings of TAM-dependent homeostatic phagocytosis, Mer plays a predominant role while Axl is dispensable, and activation of Mer by Protein S is sufficient to drive phagocytosi.
murine and human plaques are hypoxic, but it remains unclear whether plaque hypoxia is causally related to atherogenesis. Here, we test the hypothesis that reversal of hypoxia in atherosclerotic plaques by breathing hyperoxic carbogen gas will prevent atherosclerosi.
ty lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLR(-/-)) were fed a Western-type diet, exposed to carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2) or air, and the effect on plaque hypoxia, size, and phenotype was studied. First, the hypoxic marker pimonidazole was detected in murine LDLR(-/-) plaque macrophages from plaque initiation onwards. Second, the efficacy of breathing carbogen (90 minutes, single exposure) was studied. Compared with air, carbogen increased arterial blood pO2 5-fold in LDLR(-/-) mice and reduced plaque hypoxia in advanced plaques of the aortic root (-32%) and arch (-84%). Finally, the effect of repeated carbogen exposure on progression of atherosclerosis was studied in LDLR(-/-) mice fed a Western-type diet for an initial 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of diet and carbogen or air (both 90 min/d). Carbogen reduced plaque hypoxia (-40%), necrotic core size (-37%), and TUNEL(+) (terminal uridine nick-end labeling positive) apoptotic cell content (-50%) and increased efferocytosis of apoptotic cells by cluster of differentiation 107b(+) (CD107b, MAC3) macrophages (+36%) in advanced plaques of the aortic root. Plaque size, plasma cholesterol, hematopoiesis, and systemic inflammation were unchanged. In vitro, hypoxia hampered efferocytosis by bone marrow-derived macrophages, which was dependent on the receptor Mer tyrosine kinas.
restored murine plaque oxygenation and prevented necrotic core expansion by enhancing efferocytosis, likely via Mer tyrosine kinase. Thus, plaque hypoxia is causally related to necrotic core expansio.
ance of apoptotic cells is critical for both tissue homeostasis and the resolution of inflammation. We found that the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases Axl and Mer had distinct roles as phagocytic receptors in these two settings, in which they exhibited divergent expression, regulation and activity. Mer acted as a tolerogenic receptor in resting macrophages and during immunosuppression. In contrast, Axl was an inflammatory response receptor whose expression was induced by proinflammatory stimuli. Axl and Mer differed in their ligand specificities, ligand-receptor complex formation in tissues, and receptor shedding upon activation. These differences notwithstanding, phagocytosis by either protein was strictly dependent on receptor activation triggered by bridging of TAM receptor-ligand complexes to the 'eat-me' signal phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cell.
myeloma is a mostly incurable malignancy characterized by the expansion of a malignant plasma cell (PC) clone in the human bone marrow (BM). Myeloma cells closely interact with the BM stroma, which secretes soluble factors that foster myeloma progression and therapy resistance. Growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) is produced by BM-derived stroma cells and can promote malignancy. However, the role of Gas6 and its receptors Axl, Tyro3 and Mer (TAM receptors) in myeloma is unknown. We therefore investigated their expression in myeloma cell lines and in the BM of myeloma patients and healthy donors. Gas6 showed increased expression in sorted BMPCs of myeloma patients compared with healthy controls. The fraction of Mer(+) BMPCs was increased in myeloma patients in comparison with healthy controls whereas Axl and Tyro3 were not expressed by BMPCs in the majority of patients. Downregulation of Gas6 and Mer inhibited the proliferation of different myeloma cell lines, whereas knocking down Axl or Tyro3 had no effect. Inhibition of the Gas6 receptor Mer or therapeutic targeting of Gas6 by warfarin reduced myeloma burden and improved survival in a systemic model of myeloma. Thus, the Gas6-Mer axis represents a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention in this incurable malignanc.
L, and MER receptors (TAMs) are three homologous type I receptor-tyrosine kinases that are activated by endogenous ligands, protein S (PROS1) and growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6). These ligands can either activate TAMs as soluble factors, or, in turn, opsonize phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells (ACs) and serve as bridging molecules between ACs and TAMs. Abnormal expression and activation of TAMs have been implicated in promoting proliferation and survival of cancer cells, as well as in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Despite the fact that TAM receptors share significant similarity, little is known about the specificity of interaction between TAM receptors and their ligands, particularly in the context of ACs, and about the functional diversity of TAM receptors. To study ligand-mediated activation of TAMs, we generated a series of reporter cell lines expressing chimeric TAM receptors. Using this system, we found that each TAM receptor has a unique pattern of interaction with and activation by GAS6 and PROS1, which is also differentially affected by the presence of ACs, PS-containing lipid vesicles and enveloped virus. We also demonstrated that γ-carboxylation of ligands is essential for the full activation of TAMs and that soluble immunoglobulin-like TAM domains act as specific ligand antagonists. These studies demonstrate that, despite their similarity, TYRO3, AXL, and MER are likely to perform distinct functions in both immunoregulation and the recognition and removal of AC.
re to clear apoptotic cells is linked to defects in development and autoimmunity. Complement component C1q is required for efficient engulfment of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis), and C1q deficiency leads to the development of lupus. We recently identified a novel molecular mechanism for C1q-dependent efferocytosis in murine macrophages. C1q elicited the expression of Mer tyrosine kinase (Mer), a receptor that regulates efficient efferocytosis and prevention of autoimmunity. To characterize the C1q-dependent signal transduction mechanism, pathway analysis of the transcriptome from C1q-activated macrophages was performed, and it identified the adiponectin signaling pathway as significantly upregulated with C1q. Adiponectin is structurally homologous to C1q and regulates cellular metabolism via downstream activation of 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Macrophage stimulation with C1q resulted in the activation of AMPK, and silencing of AMPK expression using siRNA-inhibited C1q-dependent efferocytosis. Adiponectin signaling also stimulates activation of nuclear receptors, and inhibition of the nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor abrogated C1q-dependent Mer expression and efferocytosis. Furthermore, adiponectin elicited Mer expression and Mer-dependent efferocytosis in macrophages similar to cells stimulated with C1q. Collectively, our results suggest that C1q and adiponectin share a common signal transduction cascade to promote clearance of apoptotic cells, and identify a novel molecular pathway required for efficient efferocytosi.
four subtypes (classical, proneural, mesenchymal, and neural) of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were defined by molecular genetic analyses. The objective of this study was to assess whether gliomas, independently of the type and grade, could be subdivided into protein-based subtype.
microarray (TMA) approach was applied to incorporate tissue samples of low-grade and high-grade gliomas into five TMAs. High expression levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), CD44, c-MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, p53, oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 with the R132H mutation were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Glioma could be subdivided into four subtypes by IHC. The majority of the low-grade gliomas were of the proneural subtype, i.e. high p53 expression (63% of grade II). The classical subtype, with high EGFR and low p53 expression, was most common in GBMs (39%), followed by the proneural (29%) and mesenchymal (with high CD44 and MERTK expression) (29%) subtypes, a frequency that is in line with previously published data based on molecular genetic.
t of the expression of the five proteins EGFR, CD44, MERTK, p53 and OLIG2 is sufficient for subtyping gliomas, and can be recommended for implementation in clinical practice for both low-grade and high-grade glioma.
c melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cutaneous cancers. Although recent therapeutic advances have prolonged patient survival, the prognosis remains dismal. C-MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with oncogenic properties that is often overexpressed or activated in various malignancies. Using both protein immunohistochemistry and microarray analyses, we demonstrate that MERTK expression correlates with disease progression. MERTK expression was highest in metastatic melanomas, followed by primary melanomas, while the lowest expression was observed in nevi. Additionally, over half of melanoma cell lines overexpressed MERTK compared with normal human melanocytes; however, overexpression did not correlate with mutations in BRAF or RAS. Stimulation of melanoma cells with the MERTK ligand GAS6 resulted in the activation of several downstream signaling pathways including MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT. MERTK inhibition via shRNA reduced MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, reduced colony formation by up to 59%, and diminished tumor volume by 60% in a human melanoma murine xenograft model. Treatment of melanoma cells with UNC1062, a novel MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, reduced activation of MERTK-mediated downstream signaling, induced apoptosis in culture, reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited invasion of melanoma cells. This work establishes MERTK as a therapeutic target in melanoma and provides a rationale for the continued development of MERTK-targeted therapie.
c progression of cancer is a complex and clinically daunting process. We previously identified a set of human microRNAs (miRNAs) that robustly suppress breast cancer metastasis to lung and bone and which display expression levels that predict human metastasis. Although these findings revealed miRNAs as suppressors of cell-autonomous metastatic phenotypes, the roles of non-coding RNAs in non-cell-autonomous cancer progression processes remain unknown. Here we reveal that endogenous miR-126, an miRNA silenced in a variety of common human cancers, non-cell-autonomously regulates endothelial cell recruitment to metastatic breast cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. It suppresses metastatic endothelial recruitment, metastatic angiogenesis and metastatic colonization through coordinate targeting of IGFBP2, PITPNC1 and MERTK--novel pro-angiogenic genes and biomarkers of human metastasis. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) secreted by metastatic cells recruits endothelia by modulating IGF1-mediated activation of the IGF type-I receptor on endothelial cells; whereas c-Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK) receptor cleaved from metastatic cells promotes endothelial recruitment by competitively antagonizing the binding of its ligand GAS6 to endothelial MERTK receptors. Co-injection of endothelial cells with breast cancer cells non-cell-autonomously rescues their miR-126-induced metastatic defect, revealing a novel and important role for endothelial interactions in metastatic initiation. Through loss-of-function and epistasis experiments, we delineate an miRNA regulatory network's individual components as novel and cell-extrinsic regulators of endothelial recruitment, angiogenesis and metastatic colonization. We also identify the IGFBP2/IGF1/IGF1R and GAS6/MERTK signalling pathways as regulators of cancer-mediated endothelial recruitment. Our work further reveals endothelial recruitment and endothelial interactions in the tumour microenvironment to be critical features of metastatic breast cance.
 pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous retinal disorder. Despite tremendous knowledge about the genes involved in RP, little is known about the genetic causes of RP in Indonesia. Here, we aim to identify the molecular genetic causes underlying RP in a small cohort of Indonesian patients, using genome-wide homozygosity mappin.
es from affected and healthy individuals from 14 Indonesian families segregating autosomal recessive, X-linked, or isolated RP were collected. Homozygosity mapping was conducted using Illumina 6k or Affymetrix 5.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Known autosomal recessive RP (arRP) genes residing in homozygous regions and X-linked RP genes were sequenced for mutation.
t of the 14 families, homozygous regions were identified that contained genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of RP. Sequence analysis of these genes revealed seven novel homozygous mutations in ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4 (ABCA4), crumbs homolog 1 (CRB1), eyes shut homolog (Drosophila) (EYS), c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK), nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group E, member 3 (NR2E3) and phosphodiesterase 6A, cGMP-specific, rod, alpha (PDE6A), all segregating in the respective families. No mutations were identified in the X-linked genes retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) and retinitis pigmentosa 2 (X-linked recessive; RP2.
ity mapping is a powerful tool to identify the genetic defects underlying RP in the Indonesian population. Compared to studies involving patients from other populations, the same genes appear to be implicated in the etiology of recessive RP in Indonesia, although all mutations that were discovered are novel and as such may be unique for this populatio.
ol-laden monocyte-derived macrophages are phagocytic cells characteristic of early and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a macrophage secretory product that is abundantly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques but whose precise role in atherogenesis is unclear. The capacity of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells, through the efferocytosis mechanism, as well as to reduce cellular cholesterol accumulation contributes to prevent plaque progression and instability. By virtue of its capacity to promote cellular cholesterol efflux from phagocyte-macrophages, ABCA1 was reported to reduce atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that lipid loading in human macrophages was accompanied by a strong increase of IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, IL-6 markedly induced ABCA1 expression and enhanced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from human macrophages to apoAI. Stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by IL-6 was, however, abolished by selective inhibition of the Jak-2/Stat3 signaling pathway. In addition, we observed that the expression of molecules described to promote efferocytosis, i.e. c-mer proto-oncogene-tyrosine kinase, thrombospondin-1, and transglutaminase 2, was significantly induced in human macrophages upon treatment with IL-6. Consistent with these findings, IL-6 enhanced the capacity of human macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells; moreover, we observed that IL-6 stimulates the ABCA1-mediated efflux of cholesterol derived from the ingestion of free cholesterol-loaded apoptotic macrophages. Finally, the treatment of human macrophages with IL-6 led to the establishment of an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, characterized by an increased secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 together with a decrease of that of IL-1β. Taken together, our results indicate that IL-6 favors the elimination of excess cholesterol in human macrophages and phagocytes by stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cellular free cholesterol efflux and attenuates the macrophage proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, high amounts of IL-6 secreted by lipid laden human macrophages may constitute a protective response from macrophages to prevent accumulation of cytotoxic-free cholesterol. Such a cellular recycling of free cholesterol may contribute to reduce both foam cell formation and the accumulation of apoptotic bodies as well as intraplaque inflammation in atherosclerotic lesion.
tion is an important predictive marker in determining resistance to anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibody therapies. In order to clarify whether not only KRAS related signalling pathways but also other signalling pathways are altered in patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) with KRAS mutations, we examined the differences in the gene expression signatures between CRCs with and without KRAS mutatio.
ed and thirteen patients who underwent a surgical resection of a primary CRC were examined. KRAS mutational status was determined using the Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)-clamp real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TaqMan assay. Gene expression profiles were compared between CRCs with and without KRAS mutation using the Human Genome GeneChip array U13.
 CRCs, KRAS mutations were present in 35 tumours (31%). We identified 30 genes (probes) that were differentially expressed between CRCs with and without KRAS mutation (False Discovery Rate (FDR), p&lt;0.01), by which we were able to predict the KRAS status with an accuracy of 90.3%. Thirty discriminating genes included TC21, paired-like homeodomain 1 (PITX1), Sprouty-2, dickkopf homologue 4 (DKK-4), SET and MYND domain containing 3 (SMYD3), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14 (MAP3K14) and c-mer Proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK). These genes were related to not only KRAS related signalling pathway but also to other signalling pathways, such as the Wnt-signalling pathway, the NF-kappa B activation pathway and the TGF-beta signalling pathwa.
nt CRCs exhibited a distinct gene expression signature different from wild-type KRAS CRCs. Using human CRC samples, we were able to show that there is crosstalk between the KRAS-mediated pathway and other signalling pathways. These results are necessary to be taken into account in establishing chemotherapeutic strategies for patients with anti-EGFR-refractory KRAS mutant CRC.
ine the basis and to characterize the phenotype of a chemically induced mutation in a mouse model of retinal degeneratio.
 by indirect ophthalmoscopy identified a line of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenized mice demonstrating retinal patches. Longitudinal studies of retinal histologic sections showed photoreceptors in the peripheral retina undergoing slow, progressive degeneration. The mutation was named neuroscience mutagenesis facility 12 (nmf12), and mapping localized the critical region to Chromosome .
g of nmf12 DNA revealed a point mutation in the c-mer tyrosine kinase gene, designated Mertk(nmf12). We detected elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (Tnf, previously Tnfa) in retinas of Mertk(nmf12) homozygotes relative to wild-type controls and investigated whether the increase of TNF, an inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages/monocytes that signals intracellularly to cause necrosis or apoptosis, could underlie the retinal degeneration observed in Mertk(nmf12) homozygotes. Mertk(nmf12) homozygous mice were mated to mice lacking the entire Tnf gene and partial coding sequences of the Lta (Tnfb) and Ltb (Tnfc) genes.(2) B6.129P2-Ltb/Tnf/Lta(tm1Dvk)/J homozygotes did not exhibit a retinal degeneration phenotype and will, hereafter, be referred to as Tnfabc(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, mice homozygous for both the Mertk(nmf12) and the Ltb/Tnf/Lta(tm1Dvk) allele (Tnfabc(-/-)) demonstrated an increase in the rate of retinal degeneratio.
dings illustrate that a mutation in the Mertk gene leads to a significantly slower progressive retinal degeneration compared with other alleles of Mertk. These results demonstrate that TNF family members play a role in protecting photoreceptors of Mertk(nmf12) homozygotes from cell deat.
uch information is available on rod outer segment phagocytosis by the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), corresponding data for cones are quite limited, especially in laboratory models of normal rats and mice with very low cone numbers. To characterize the light and circadian control of cone photoreceptor phagocytosis in mice, we capitalized on the blue cone-like phenotype of neural retina leucine zipper gene (Nrl) null mice (Nrl(-/-).
mice were maintained under standard cyclic light (12h:12h light-dark [LD] cycle; light=300&nbsp;lux) for one month, then divided into two groups: 1) continued maintenance in LD (36 mice); or 2) transferred to constant darkness (DD; 21 mice) for 36 h. Animals were sacrificed every 3 h over 24 h, and their eyes were rapidly enucleated and fixed. Cryosections were stained using specific cone short-wavelength opsin antibodies. Phagosome numbers in the RPE were quantified with a morphometric system. We monitored the expression of c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in wild-type and knockout mice using a specific MerTK antibod.
ne phagocytosis showed a statistically significant peak of activity 1 h after light onset, 2-3 fold higher than at other times. In constant darkness, the temporal phagocytic profile resembled that of LD (significant peak at 1 h of subjective day), but the number of phagosomes was decreased at all time points. Immunostaining of MerTK in wild-type and Nrl(-/-) mice showed expression at the apical surface of the RP.
 outer segment phagocytosis in Nrl(-/-) mice shows a similar profile to that of rods in normal mice and other species. These data are the first to quantify blue cone-like photoreceptor phagocytosis under different lighting conditions in mice, and suggest this model may constitute a valuable system for investigating circadian regulation of cone functio.
s the most widely prescribed and effective mood-stabilizing drug used for the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. To understand how lithium produces changes in the brain, we studied brain mRNA from 10 mice after treatment with lithium and compared them with 10 untreated control.
he MAS 5.0, Smudge miner, GC-RMA and FDR-AME packages of software (Bioconductor, Seattle, Washington, USA) to determine gene expression changes using Affymetrix MOE430E 2.0 microarrays after 2 weeks of lithium treatmen.
oth a false discovery rate (FDR-AME) assessment of significance and the Bonferroni method to correct for the possibility of false-positive changes in gene expression among the 39,000 genes present in each array. Our primary method of analysis was to use t-tests on normalized gene expression intensities. By using a Bonferroni correction of P&lt;1.28x10(-6), we found that 121 genes showed significant changes in expression. The three genes with the most changed mRNA expression were alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2-like 1 (Agxt2l1), c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (Mertk) and sulfotransferase family 1A phenol-preferring member 1 (Sult1a1). Also among the group of 121 genes with significant changes in gene expression that survived Bonferroni correction () were the genes encoding the Per2 period gene (Per2 P=1.33x10(-8), 2.47-fold change), the metabotropic glutamate receptor (Grm3, P=9.48x10(-7), 0.7-fold change) and secretogranin II (Scg2, P=9.48x10(-7), 1.28-fold change) as well as several myelin-related genes and protein phosphatases. By taking a significance value of P&lt;0.05 without Bonferroni or FDR-AME correction, we identified a total of 4474 genes showing changed mRNA expression in response to lithium. FDR-AME analysis showed that 1027 out of these 4474 genes were significantly changed in expression. Among the mRNAs that were significantly changed with t-tests and FDR-AME were several that had already been implicated in response to lithium such as increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA ( t-test P=0.0008-0.0005, FDR-AME P=0.0396-0.0393, 1.44-fold change) beta-phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Pitpnb, t-test P&lt;0.0000, FDR-AME P=0.003, 1.26-fold change) and inositol (myo)-1(or 4)-monophosphatase 1(Impa1, t test P&lt;0.0000, FDR-AME P=0.004, 1.22-fold change). Of interest in relation to the side effect of hypothyroidism, which is caused by long-term lithium treatment was the fact that we observed changes in mRNA expression in five genes related to thyroxine metabolism. These included deiodinase (Dio2 t-test P=0.000003-0.004, FDR-AME P=0.0048-0.061, 1.53-fold change) and thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12 (Trip12, t-test P=0.003, FDR-AME P=0.075, 1.19-fold change). Of relevance to multiple sclerosis was the observed upregulation of the long isoform of myelin basic protein (t-test P=0.00013, FDR-AME P=0.0169). Changes in mRNA expression were found in 45 genes related to phosphatidylinositol metabolism using uncorrected t-tests but only 13 genes after FDR-AME. Thus, our work confirms the considerable previous research implicating this system. Gene ontology analysis showed that lithium significantly affected a cluster of processes associated with nucleotide and nucleoside metabolism. The analysis showed that there were 170 genes expressing RNA described as having ATP-binding or ATPase activity that had changed mRNA expression. The changes found have been discussed in relation to previous experimental work on the pharmacology of lithiu.
ed progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA) is a hereditary ocular disorder with progressive photoreceptor degeneration in dogs. Four retina-specific genes, ATP binding cassette transporter retina (ABCA4), connexin 36 (CX36), c-mer tyrosin kinase receptor (MERTK) and photoreceptor cell retinol dehydrogenase (RDH12) were investigated in order to identify mutations leading to autosomal recessive (ar) gPRA in 29 breeds of dog.
screening was performed initially by PCR and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, representing a simple method with comparatively high reliability for identification of sequence variations in many samples. Conspicuous banding patterns were analyzed via sequence analyses in order to detect the underlying nucleotide variations. No pathogenetically relevant mutations were detected in the genes ABCA4, CX36, MERTK and RDH12 in 71 affected dogs of 29 breeds. Yet 30 new sequence variations were identified, both, in the coding regions and intronic sequences. Many of the sequence variations were in heterozygous state in affected dog.
the ar transmittance of gPRA in the breeds investigated, informative sequence variations provide evidence allowing indirect exclusion of pathogenetic mutations in the genes ABCA4 (for 9 breeds), CX36 (for 12 breeds), MERTK (for all 29 breeds) and RDH12 (for 9 breeds.
al role of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas-6) in energy storage in adipose tissue was investigated in murine models of obesity. Gas-6 is a ligand for the Axl, C-Mer, and Sky family of tyrosine kinase receptor.
as-6, C-Mer, and Sky were expressed in mature murine adipocytes, the expression of Axl was restricted to the stromal-vascular fraction, which includes pre-adipocytes. During the in vitro conversion of adipogenic 3T3-F442A cells into mature adipocytes, the expression of Gas-6 increased in undifferentiated confluent pre-adipocytes during a transient phase of growth arrest. On treatment of these cells with an adipogenic medium, Gas-6 expression decreased sharply, coinciding with expression of early adipocytes markers. This modulation was not observed in the nonadipogenic 3T3-C2 cells. The Gas-6 mRNA level was transiently downregulated during nutritionally induced expansion of adipose tissues in vivo. When kept on a standard diet, no significant difference in either total body weight or weight of gonadal or subcutaneous fat pads was observed between Gas-6 deficient and wild-type mice. On exposure to a high-fat diet, however, Gas-6-deficient mice had significantly less fat mass than their wild-type counterpart.
ances the accumulation of adipose tissue in diet-induced obese mic.
 is one of two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early proteins that mediate the switch from the latent to the lytic form of viral replication. In this report, we show that R induces expression of the cellular C-mer gene in a variety of cell lines. C-mer expression was detected in lymphoblastoid cells immortalized with wild-type EBV but not in lymphoblastoid cells immortalized with an EBV that had BRLF1 deleted. Oral hairy leukoplakia tongue tissue, which contains the lytic form of EBV replication, also has enhanced C-mer expression. C-mer is a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by the ligand Gas6. C-mer is required for phagocytosis of apoptotic debris by monocytes/macrophages and retinal pigment epithelial cells and is capable of producing an antiapoptotic signal. Modulation of the C-mer signal transduction cascade by a variety of different approaches did not alter the ability of R to induce lytic EBV gene transcription. Therefore, C-mer activation may be important for some other aspect of lytic EBV infectio.
 leukocytes must be cleared efficiently by macrophages (Mø). Apoptotic cell phagocytosis by Mø requires the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) MerTK (also known as c-Mer and Tyro12), the phosphatidylserine receptor (PS-R), and the classical protein kinase C (PKC) isoform betaII, which translocates to Mø membrane and cytoskeletal fractions in a PS-R-dependent manner. How these molecules cooperate to induce phagocytosis is unknown. As the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase (PI-PLC) gamma2 is downstream of RTKs in some cell types and can activate classical PKCs, we hypothesized that MerTK signals via PLC gamma2. To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction of MerTK and PLC gamma2 in resident, murine peritoneal (P)Mø and in the murine Mø cell line J774A.1 (J774) following exposure to apoptotic thymocytes. We found that as with PMø, J774 phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes was inhibited by antibody against MerTK. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation showed that exposure to apoptotic cells produced three time-dependent changes in PMø and J774: tyrosine phosphorylation of MerTK; association of PLC gamma2 with MerTK; and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma2. Cross-linking MerTK using antibody also induced phosphorylation of PLC gamma2 and its association with MerTK. A PI-PLC appears to be required for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, as the PI-PLC inhibitor Et-18-OCH3 and the PLC inhibitor U73122, but not the inactive control U73343, blocked phagocytosis without impairing adhesion. On apoptotic cell adhesion to Mø, MerTK signals at least in part via PLC gamma.
ing the membrane tyrosine kinase c-mer have been shown to have altered macro-phage cytokine production and defective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells despite normal phagocytosis of other particles. We show here that c-mer-deficient mice have impaired clearance of infused apoptotic cells and that they develop progressive lupus-like autoimmunity, with antibodies to chromatin, DNA, and IgG. The autoimmunity appears to be driven by endogenous antigens, with little polyclonal B cell activation. These mice should be an excellent model for studying the role of apoptotic debris as an immunogenic stimulus for systemic autoimmunit.
 known as &quot;Tyro3&quot; and &quot;Rse&quot;) is a member of the Axl/Sky/Mer receptor tyrosine kinase family and has two immunoglobulin-like repeats and two fibronectin type III-like repeats in the extracellular domain. Gas6 is a ligand for all members of the Axl family, each of which (Axl, Sky, and c-Mer) has different affinities to Gas6. Physiological functions of Sky and Gas6 in the nervous system are not well understood, despite their importance, which is suggested by Sky structural features and its predominant expression in the brain. We found in the RNase protection assays that gas6 and sky mRNAs are expressed in the adult rat hippocampus and are similarly regulated during development. Expression levels were low during embryonic stages but gradually increased during development and reached the highest level in adulthood. Sky, but not Axl, immunoreactivity was observed in the adult hippocampus. Recombinant rat Gas6 attenuated hippocampal neuronal cell death that was caused by serum starvation in vitro, indicating that Gas6 is a novel neurotrophic factor for hippocampal neurons. Gas6 showed regulated expression in the sciatic nerve after nerve transection. Therefore, Sky and Gas6 have neurotrophic roles in the nervous syste.
 adenomas account for approximately 10% of intracranial tumors, but little is known of the oncogenesis of these tumors. The identification of tumor-specific genes may further elucidate the pathways of tumor formation. We used complementary DNA microarrays to examine gene expression profiles in nonfunctioning, PRL, GH, and ACTH secreting adenomas, compared with normal pituitary. Microarray analysis showed that 128 of 7075 genes examined were differentially expressed. We then analyzed three genes with unique expression patterns and oncogenic importance by RT-real time quantitative PCR in 37 pituitaries. Folate receptor gene was significantly overexpressed in nonfunctioning adenomas but was significantly underexpressed in PRL and GH adenomas, compared with controls and to other tumors. The ornithine decarboxylase gene was significantly overexpressed in GH adenomas, compared with other tumor subtypes but was significantly underexpressed in ACTH adenomas. C-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase gene was significantly overexpressed in ACTH adenomas but was significantly underexpressed in PRL adenomas. We have shown that at least three genes involved in carcinogenesis in other tissues are also aberrantly regulated in the major types of pituitary tumors. The evaluation of candidate genes that emerge from these experiments provides a rational approach to investigate those genes significant in tumorigenesi.
at presents an autosomal recessive retinal pigment epithelium dystrophy characterized by the outer segments of photoreceptors being phagocytosis-deficient. A systematic genetic study allowed us to restrict the interval containing the rdy locus to that between the markers D3Mit13 and D3Rat256. We report the chromosomal localization of the rat c-mer gene in the cytogenetic bands 3q35-36, based on genetic analysis and radiation hybrid mapping. Using a systematic biocomputing analysis, we identified two strong related candidate genes encoding protein tyrosine kinase receptors of the AXL subfamily. The comparison of their expression patterns in human and mice tissues suggested that the c-mer gene was the best gene to screen for mutations. RCS rdy- and RCS rdy+ cDNAs were sequenced. The RCS rdy- cDNAs carried a significant deletion in the 5' part of the coding sequence of the c-mer gene resulting in a shortened aberrant transcript encoding a 20 amino acid peptide. The c-mer gene contains characteristic motifs of neural cell adhesion. A ligand of the c-mer receptor, Gas6, exhibits antiapoptotic propertie.
 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is most closely related to chicken c-Eyk and belongs to the Axl RTK subfamily. Although not detected in normal lymphocytes, c-Mer is expressed in B- and T-cell leukemia cell lines, suggesting an association with lymphoid malignancies. To gain an understanding of the role of this receptor in lymphoid cells, we expressed in murine interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 pro-B-lymphocyte cells a constitutively active receptor, CDMer, formed from the CD8 extracellular domain and the c-Mer intracellular domain. Cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the CDMer receptor became IL-3 independent. When tyrosine (Y)-to-phenylalanine (F) mutations were introduced into c-Mer, only the Y867 change significantly reduced the IL-3-independent cell proliferation. The Y867 residue in the CDMer receptor mediated the binding of Grb2, which recruited the p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Despite the difference in promotion of proliferation, both the CDMer and mutant F867 receptors activated Erk in transfected cells. On the other hand, we found that both transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and activation of PI 3-kinase were significantly suppressed with the F867 mutant receptor, suggesting that the activation of antiapoptotic pathways is the major mechanism for the observed phenotypic difference. Consistent with this notion, apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal was strongly prevented by CDMer but not by the F867 mutant recepto.
 and c-Mer comprise a family of cell adhesion molecule-related tyrosine kinase receptors. Human Gas6 was recently shown to act as a ligand for both human Rse (Godowski et al., 1995) and human Ax1 (Varnum et al., 1995). Gas6 contains an NH2-terminal Gla domain followed by four epidermal growth factor-like repeats and tandem globular (G) domains. The G domains are related to those found in sex hormone-binding globulin and to those utilized by laminin and agrin for binding to the dystroglycan complex. A series of Gas6 variants were tested for their ability to bind to Rse and Ax1. The Gla domain and epidermal growth factor-like repeats were not required for receptor binding, as deletion variants of Gas6 which lacked these domains bound to the extracellular domains of both Rse and Axl. A deletion variant of Gas6 containing just the G domain region was shown to activate Rse phosphorylation. These results provide evidence that G domains can act as signaling molecules by activating transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, they provide a structural link between the activation of cell adhesion related receptors and the control of cell growth and differentiation by the G domain-containing superfamily of protein.
loned the putative mouse homologue of the human c-mer receptor tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene. Comparison of the mouse and human c-mer amino acid sequences reveals an overall identity of 88%. Similar to the human, the extracellular region of the murine c-mer protein possesses two amino terminal immunoglobulin-like domains and two membrane proximal fibronectin type III domains, which places it in the Axl family of tyrosine kinases. Our analysis of the Axl family identifies eight different regions of amino acid consensus that have residues characteristic of this and no other tyrosine kinase family; six of the eight are within tyrosine kinase subdomains. The homology within the Axl family is highest between c-mer and c-eyk, the chicken proto-oncogene of the tumor virus gene product v-eyk. Northern analysis of adult tissues suggests that the mouse c-mer, although expressed in many tissues, has an expression pattern unique among Axl family members. In normal adult hematopoietic cells c-mer seems to be expressed predominantly if not exclusively in the monocytic lineage. Mouse c-mer is expressed during most, if not all, stages of embryological development beginning in the morula and blastocyst and progressing through the yolk sac and fetal liver stages. This early and consistent expression of c-mer was confirmed during in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells. The embryonic expression profile of c-mer suggests that this tyrosine kinase may play an important function in the developing mous.
-lymphoblastoid lambda gt11 expression library was screened using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies yielding complementary DNAs encoding active tyrosine kinases. The resulting clones were used to obtain the sequence of a novel 984 amino acid transmembrane tyrosine kinase. Analysis of the complementary DNA revealed extracellular immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III domains and the unusual kinase signature sequence KWIAIES; all are characteristic of the axl family of tyrosine kinases. The novel tyrosine kinase was not expressed in normal B- and T-lymphocytes but, unlike axl, was expressed in numerous neoplastic B- and T-cell lines. Transcripts for the novel receptor-like tyrosine kinase were detected in normal peripheral blood monocytes and bone marrow. One alternatively spliced transcript was detected which contained an insert in the membrane proximal region that could encode for a truncated, soluble receptor. Sequence comparison shows that the kinase may be the human protooncogene for the recently isolated chicken retroviral oncogene v-ryk (recently renamed v-eyk), a truncated tyrosine kinase whose expression by retroviral infection produced sarcomas in chickens. The intracellular domain of the human kinase shows 83% similarity and 71% identity to v-ryk. Since the ryk designation has been used to name another tyrosine kinase and an analysis of RNA expression demonstrated that this novel human kinase is expressed in monocytes and tissues of epithelial and reproductive origin, we have designated our novel protooncogene c-me.
ceptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the Tyro/Axl/Mer (TAM) family, has been shown to be overexpressed in breast cancer with poor outcome. Moreover, Axl was associated with a basal-like phenotype (BLP) in these tumors. Our aim was to investigate Axl expression in breast cancers from an African population since these tumors are known to be aggressive and have a high frequency of the basal-like phenotype. We studied 170 paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma cases by tissue microarrays and immunohistochemical methods. In total, 128 tumor cases (75%) had strong Axl expression and 42 cases (25%) had weak or negative staining. Strong expression of Axl was associated with high tumor grade (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.0005), estrogen receptor (ER) negativity (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.024), p53 expression (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.004), P-cadherin positivity (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.017), and basal-like phenotypic profiles BLP2 (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.033) and BLP3 (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.022). In addition, Axl overexpression also showed an association with markers of tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. In conclusion, our findings indicate strong expression of Axl in a high proportion of breast cancer cases among African women and associations with markers of aggressive features, indicating poor prognosis. These findings suggest Axl as a potential therapeutic target in this populatio.
 pigmentosa is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness, affecting millions of people worldwide. The mechanisms of and effective treatments for the disease, however, remain to be further investigated. The Royal College of Surgeons rat is one of the most widely used animal models for the study of retinal degeneration diseases. The mutation in the mer tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene of this model leads to deficient phagocytosis in the retinal pigment epithelium cells and the accumulation of photoreceptor out segments in the subretinal space, ultimately resulting in retinal degeneration. The retina begins to change as early as 17 days after birth and becomes gradually thinner with the death and remodeling of cells and blood vessels. Retinal cell apoptosis plays a dominant role in this degeneration, with some cells being activated by the secondary alterations of the retinal neurotransmitter and other related factor.
-Met pathway is known to play a key role in cancer metastasis. CLN0003_SL1, a 50-mer DNA aptamer that binds to the c-Met protein, was found to inhibit HGF-induced c-Met activation. This aptamer could suppress cancer cell motility in vitr.
odulation is the treatment with light in the far-red to near-infrared region of the spectrum and has been reported to have beneficial effects in various animal models of disease, including an age-related macular degeneration (AMD) mouse model. Previous reports have suggested that phagocytosis is reduced by age-related increased oxidative stress in AMD. Therefore, we investigated whether photobiomodulation improves phagocytosis caused by oxidative stress in the human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cell lin.
ells and human primary retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE) cells were incubated and irradiated with near-infrared light (670 nm LED light, 2,500 lx, twice a day, 250 s/per time) for 4 d. Next, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and photoreceptor outer segments (POS) labeled using a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye were added to the cell culture, and phagocytosis was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, cell death was observed by double staining with Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide after photobiomodulation. CM-H2DCFDA, JC-1 dye, and CCK-8 were added to the cell culture to investigate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell viability, respectively. We also investigated the expression of phagocytosis-related proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK.
 stress inhibited phagocytosis, and photobiomodulation increased the oxidative stress-induced hypoactivity of phagocytosis in ARPE-19 cells and hRPE cells. Furthermore, H2O2 and photobiomodulation did not affect cell death in this experimental condition. Photobiomodulation reduced ROS production but did not affect cell viability or mitochondrial membrane potential. The expression of phosphorylated MerTK increased, but phosphorylated FAK was not affected by photobiomodulatio.
dings indicate that near-infrared light photobiomodulation (670 nm) may be a noninvasive, inexpensive, and easy adjunctive therapy to help inhibit the development of ocular diseases induced by the activation of phagocytosi.
ion of the innate immune response to clear and metabolize necrotic and apoptotic cardiomyocytes is a prerequisite to heart repair after cardiac injury. Suboptimal kinetics of dying myocyte clearance leads to secondary necrosis, and in the case of the heart, increased potential for collateral loss of neighboring non-regenerative myocytes. Despite the importance of myocyte phagocytic clearance during heart repair, surprisingly little is known about its underlying cell and molecular biolog.
ine if phagocytic receptor MERTK is expressed in human hearts and to elucidate key sequential steps and phagocytosis efficiency of dying adult cardiomyocytes, by macrophage.
ted human hearts, expression profiles of the phagocytic receptor MER-tyrosine kinase (MERTK) mimicked that found in experimental ischemic mouse hearts. Electron micrographs of myocardium identified MERTK signal along macrophage phagocytic cups and Mertk-/- macrophages contained reduced digested myocyte debris after myocardial infarction. Ex vivo co-culture of primary macrophages and adult cardiomyocyte apoptotic bodies revealed reduced engulfment relative to resident cardiac fibroblasts. Inefficient clearance was not due to the larger size of myocyte apoptotic bodies, nor were other key steps preceding the formation of phagocytic synapses significantly affected; this included macrophage chemotaxis and direct binding of phagocytes to myocytes. Instead, suppressed phagocytosis was directly associated with myocyte-induced inactivation of MERTK, which was partially rescued by genetic deletion of a MERTK proteolytic susceptibility sit.
 an ex vivo co-cultivation approach to model key cellular and molecular events found in vivo during infarction, cardiomyocyte phagocytosis was found to be inefficient, in part due to myocyte-induced shedding of macrophage MERTK. These findings warrant future studies to identify other cofactors of macrophage-cardiomyocyte cross-talk that contribute to cardiac pathophysiolog.
ate the mechanism of the induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) by photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and its effects on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE.
regulation by POS was confirmed in ARPE-19 cells and in RPE ex vivo. To elucidate the mechanism, siRNAs against β5 integrin, CD36, Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK), and Atg5, blocking antibodies against CD36 and MerTK, and a specific inhibitor for focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were used. We examined the effect of POS-induced PGC-1α upregulation on the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial biogenesis, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) after H2O2 treatment, and lysosomal activity. Lysosomal activity was evaluated through transcriptional factor EB and its target genes, and the activity of cathepsin D. Lipid metabolism after POS treatment was assessed using Oil Red O and BODIPY C11. RPE phenotypes of PGC-1α-deficient mice were examine.
ed PGC-1α upregulation was suppressed by siRNA against β5 integrin and a FAK inhibitor. siRNAs and blocking antibodies against CD36 and MerTK enhanced the effect of POS on PGC-1α. The upregulation of PGC-1α increased the levels of mRNA for antioxidant enzymes and stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis, decreased ROS levels, and reduced SA-β-gal staining in H2O2-treated ARPE-19 cells. PGC-1α was critical for lysosomal activity and lipid metabolism after POS treatment. PGC-1α-deficient mice demonstrated an accumulation of type 2 lysosomes in RPE, thickening of Bruch's membrane, and poor choriocapillaris vasculatur.
ng, but not the internalization of POS confers protective effects on RPE cells through the αvβ5 integrin/FAK/PGC-1α pathwa.
ar receptors PPAR-γ and LXRs regulate macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation. We examined the influence of these molecules on macrophage alternative activation, with particular focus on differentiation of &quot;M2c&quot; anti-inflammatory cell.
ed human monocytes in M0, M1, M2a or M2c macrophage differentiating conditions, in the presence or absence of PPAR-γ and LXR ligands. Flow cytometry was used to analyze membrane expression of phenotypic markers. Basal and LPS-stimulated production of soluble mediators was measured by ELISA. Efferocytosis assays were performed by coincubating monocytes/macrophages with apoptotic neutrophil.
that PPAR-γ inhibition, using the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662, elicits differentiation of M2c-like (CD206(+) CD163(+) CD16(+)) cells and upregulation of the MerTK/Gas6 axis. Exposure of differentiating macrophages to IFN-γ, GM-CSF or LPS (M1 conditions), however, hampers GW9662 induction of MerTK and Gas6. When macrophages are differentiated with IL-4 (M2a conditions), addition of GW9662 results into an M2a (CD206(+) CD209(+) CD163(-) MerTK(-)) to M2c (CD206(high) CD209(-) CD163(+) MerTK(+)) polarization shift. Conversely, in the presence of dexamethasone (M2c conditions), the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone attenuates CD163 and MerTK upregulation. The LXR agonist T0901317 induces MerTK independently of M2c polarization; indeed, CD206, CD163 and CD16 are downregulated. GW9662-differentiated M2c-like cells secrete high levels of Gas6 and low amounts of TNF-α and IL-10, mimicking dexamethasone effects in vitro. However, unlike conventional M2c cells, GW9662-differentiated cells do not show enhanced efferocytic abilit.
ts provide new insights into the role of PPAR-γ and LXR receptors in human macrophage activation and reveal the existence of different patterns regulating MerTK expression. Unexpectedly, PPAR-γ appears to negatively control the expansion of a discrete subset of M2c-like anti-inflammatory macrophage.
 clearance of apoptotic cells is essential for tissue homeostasis, allowing for cellular turnover without inflammatory consequences. The Mer (Nyk and c-Eyk) receptor tyrosine kinase (Mertk) is involved in two aspects of apoptotic cell clearance by acting as a receptor for Gas6, a gamma-carboxylated phosphatidylserine-binding protein that bridges apoptotic and viable cells. First, Mertk acts in a bona fide engulfment pathway in concert with alphavbeta5 integrin by regulating cytoskeletal assemblages, and second, it acts as a negative regulator for inflammation by down-modulating pro-inflammatory signals mediated from bacterial lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, and hence recapitulating anti-inflammatory immune modulation by apoptotic cells. Here we describe Mertk post-receptor events that govern phagocytosis and cytoskeletal signaling are principally mediated by autophosphorylation site Tyr-867. Using the Mertk Y867F mutant and pharmacological inhibitors, we show that Tyr-867 is required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase Cgamma2 activation; their activation in turn elicits protein kinase C-dependent signals that act on the actin cytoskeleton. Although Mertk(Y867F) blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-861 and p130(cas) and also abrogated the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, this mutant did not suppress lipopolysaccharide-inducible NF-kappaB transcription, nor was NF-kappaB activation dependent on the protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C. Finally, unlike the cytoskeletal events associated with Tyr-867 autophosphorylation, the trans-inhibition of NF-kappaB occurred in a postnuclear-dependent fashion independent of cytosolic IkappaB phosphorylation and p65/RelA sequestration. Taken together, these data suggest that Mertk has distinct and separable effects for phagocytosis and for resolving inflammation, providing a molecular rationale for how immune licensing and inflammation can be dissociated from phagocytosis in a single phagocytic recepto.
 cells must be cleared efficiently by macrophages (Mø) to prevent autoimmunity, yet their ingestion impairs Mø microbicidal function. The principal murine resident lung phagocyte, the alveolar Mø (AMø), is specifically deficient at apoptotic cell ingestion, both in vitro and in vivo, compared with resident peritoneal Mø (PMø). To further characterize this deficiency, we assayed static adhesion in vitro using apoptotic thymocytes and resident AMø and PMø from normal C57BL/6 mice. Adhesion of apoptotic thymocytes by both types of Mø was rapid, specific, and cold-sensitive. Antibody against the receptor tyrosine kinase MerTK (Tyro12) blocked phagocytosis but not adhesion in both types of Mø. Surfactant protein A increased adhesion and phagocytosis by AMø, but not to the levels seen using PMø. Adhesion was largely cation-independent for PMø and calcium-dependent for AMø. Adhesion was not inhibited in either Mø type by mAbs against beta1 or beta3 integrins or scavenger receptor I/II (CD204), but AMø adhesion was inhibited by specific mAbs against CD11c/CD18. Thus, resident murine tissue Mø from different tissues depend on qualitatively disparate receptor systems to bind apoptotic cells. The decreased capacity of murine AMø to ingest apoptotic cells is only partially explained by reduced initial adhesio.
 apoptosis may be associated with the male infertility. The pathogenesis is to be further understood. Viral infection is one of the causative factors of apoptosis of the body cells. This study aims to investigate the role of activation of Toll like receptor (TLR)3 in the induction of germ cell apoptosis. In this study, spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse testes. The expression of TLR3 on SSC was by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) was employed to activate TLR3 on SSCs. The results showed that re-activation by PolyI:C induced SSC apoptosis. Exposure to PolyI:C induced interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation in SSCs. TLR3 and IRF3 formed a complex in the SSCs. The complex of TLR3/IRF3 bound to the promoter of Fas ligand and promoted Fas ligand expression in SSC, and thus induced SSC apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that activation of TLR3 by PolyI:C induces the SSC apoptosis, which implies that viral infection may interfere with the male germ cell development.

expression levels of interferon-x03B3; (IFN-x03B3;)-inducible genes correlate positively with liver diseases. The present study aimed to explore the effect of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) on the expression of genes induced by IFN-x03B3; in vitro, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.
 L02 cells were divided into control, ISL, IFN-x03B3;, and IFN-x03B3; plus ISL groups. The cytotoxicity of compounds to cells was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) assay; the expression levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, CXCL11, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cells and supernatant were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and ELISA, respectively. Moreover, western blot was used to examine the phosphorylated levels of janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), nuclear factor (NF)-x03BA;B, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B (Akt) in HepG2 and L02 cells exposed to ISL, IFN-x03B3; and IFN-x03B3; plus IS.
ts showed that IFN-x03B3; treatment induced the expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL-6 in HepG2 and LO2 cells, which could be significantly and dose-dependently inhibited by ISL treatment (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01), but the inhibitory effect of ISL on IL-6 expression was not so good as on CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 expression. Furthermore, ISL treatment dose-dependently inhibited the activation of JAK1/STAT1, IRF3/MyD88, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (P &lt; 0.05), but had no effect on the activation of JAK2/STAT1, NF-x03BA;B and p38/MAPK signaling pathway.
trate that ISL inhibits IFN-x03B3;-induced inflammation in hepatocytes via influencing the activation of JAK1/STAT1, IRF3/MyD88, ERK/MAPK, JNK/MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
et (UV) irradiation can result in premature skin aging (photoaging) which is characterized by decreased expression of collagen and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can be generated at various conditions including virally infected cells or UV-damaged skin cells. Recent studies have shown that a synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), can reduce procollagen expression in human skin fibroblasts. However, little is known about the effect of poly(I:C) on the expression of MMPs in skin fibroblasts and its underlying mechanism.
ed the effect of poly(I:C) on MMP-1, -2, and -3 expressions in human skin fibroblasts. Then, we further explored the underlying signaling pathways involved in the processe.
n fibroblasts were treated with poly(I:C) for the indicated times in the presence or the absence of various chemical inhibitors or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) at the indicated concentrations. Protein and mRNA levels of various target molecules were examined by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR, respectivel.
 induced MMP-1, -2, and -3 expressions, which were dependent on TLR3. Poly(I:C) also induced activations of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathways. By using specific inhibitors, we found that poly(I:C)-induced expressions of MMP-1, -2, and -3 were differentially regulated by these signaling pathways. In particular, we found that the inhibition of IRF3 signaling pathways attenuated poly(I:C)-induced expressions of all the three MMP.
show that the expressions of MMP-1, -2, and -3 are induced by poly(I:C) through various signaling pathways in human skin fibroblasts and suggest that TLR3 and/or IRF3 may be good targets for regulating the expressions of MMP-1, -2, and -3 induced by dsRNA.
rus (LLOV) is a new member of the filovirus family that also includes Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV). LLOV has not been cultured; however, its genomic RNA sequence indicates the coding capacity to produce homologs of the EBOV and MARV VP24, VP35, and VP40 proteins. EBOV and MARV VP35 proteins inhibit interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta production and EBOV VP35 blocks activation of the antiviral kinase PKR. The EBOV VP24 and MARV VP40 proteins inhibit IFN signaling, albeit by different mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that LLOV VP35 suppresses Sendai virus induced IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, IFN-α/β production, and PKR phosphorylation. Additionally, LLOV VP24 blocks tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 binding to karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), STAT1 nuclear accumulation, and IFN-induced gene expression. LLOV VP40 lacks detectable IFN antagonist function. These activities parallel EBOV IFN inhibitory functions. EBOV and LLOV VP35 and VP24 proteins also inhibit IFN responses in bat cells. These data suggest that LLOV infection will block innate immune responses in a manner similar to EBO.
mplex encephalitis (HSE) in children has previously been linked to defects in type I interferon (IFN) production downstream of Toll-like receptor 3. Here, we describe a novel genetic etiology of HSE by identifying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) gene, leading to autosomal dominant (AD) IRF3 deficiency by haploinsufficiency, in an adolescent female patient with HSE. IRF3 is activated by most pattern recognition receptors recognizing viral infections and plays an essential role in induction of type I IFN. The identified IRF3 R285Q amino acid substitution results in impaired IFN responses to HSV-1 infection and particularly impairs signaling through the TLR3-TRIF pathway. In addition, the R285Q mutant of IRF3 fails to become phosphorylated at S386 and undergo dimerization, and thus has impaired ability to activate transcription. Finally, transduction with WT IRF3 rescues the ability of patient fibroblasts to express IFN in response to HSV-1 infection. The identification of IRF3 deficiency in HSE provides the first description of a defect in an IFN-regulating transcription factor conferring increased susceptibility to a viral infection in the CNS in human.
se to virus infection, RIG-I senses viral RNA and activates the adaptor protein MAVS, which then forms prion-like filaments and stimulates a specific signalling pathway leading to type I interferon production to restrict virus proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which MAVS activity is regulated remain elusive. Here we identify distinct regions of MAVS responsible for activation of transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). These IRF3- and NF-κB-stimulating regions recruit preferential TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) for downstream signalling. Strikingly, these regions' activities are inhibited by their respective adjacent regions in quiescent MAVS. Our data thus show that an autoinhibitory mechanism modulates MAVS activity in unstimulated cells and, on viral infection, individual regions of MAVS are released following MAVS filament formation to activate antiviral signalling cascade.
sory HIV protein Vpu inhibits a number of cellular pathways that trigger host innate restriction mechanisms. HIV Vpu-mediated degradation of tetherin allows efficient particle release and hampers the activation of the NF-κB pathway thereby limiting the expression of proinflammatory genes. In addition, Vpu reduces cell surface expression of several cellular molecules such as newly synthesized CD4. However, the role of HIV Vpu in regulating the type 1 interferon response to viral infection by degradation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) has been subject of conflicting reports. We therefore systematically investigated the expression of IRF3 in primary CD4(+) T cells and macrophages infected with HIV at different time points. In addition, we also tested the ability of Vpu to interfere with innate immune signaling pathways such as the NF-κB and the IRF3 pathways. We report here that HIV Vpu failed to degrade IRF3 in infected primary cells. Moreover, we observed that HIV NL4.3 Vpu had no effect on IRF3-dependent gene expression in reporter assays. On the other hand, HIV NL4.3 Vpu downmodulated NF-κB-dependent transcription. Mutation of two serines (positions 52 and 56) involved in the binding of NL4.3 Vpu to the βTrCP ubiquitin ligase abolishes its ability to inhibit NF-κB activity. Taken together, these results suggest that HIV Vpu regulates antiviral innate response in primary human cells by acting specifically on the NF-κB pathwa.
lays a pivotal role in enhancing HIV infection by counteraction of Tetherin. However, Vpu also regulates host response to HIV infection by hampering the type 1 interferon response. The molecular mechanism by which Vpu inhibits the interferon response is still controversial. Here we report that Vpu affects interferon expression by inhibiting NF-κB activity without affecting IRF3 levels or activity. These data suggest that Vpu facilitates HIV infection by regulating NF-κB transcription to levels sufficient for viral transcription while limiting cellular responses to infectio.
 of an antiviral innate immune response relies on pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLR), to detect invading pathogens, resulting in the activation of multiple latent transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Upon sensing of viral RNA and DNA, IRF3 is phosphorylated and recruits coactivators to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and selected sets of IRF3-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as those for ISG54 (Ifit2), ISG56 (Ifit1), and viperin (Rsad2). Here, we used wild-type, glycogen synthase kinase 3α knockout (GSK-3α(-/-)), GSK-3β(-/-), and GSK-3α/β double-knockout (DKO) embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as GSK-3β(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells in which GSK-3α was knocked down to demonstrate that both isoforms of GSK-3, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, are required for this antiviral immune response. Moreover, the use of two selective small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitors (CHIR99021 and BIO-acetoxime) or ES cells reconstituted with the catalytically inactive versions of GSK-3 isoforms showed that GSK-3 activity is required for optimal induction of antiviral innate immunity. Mechanistically, GSK-3 isoform activation following Sendai virus infection results in phosphorylation of β-catenin at S33/S37/T41, promoting IRF3 DNA binding and activation of IRF3-regulated ISGs. This study identifies the role of a GSK-3/β-catenin axis in antiviral innate immunit.
 receptor A (SRA) has been implicated in the processes of tumor invasion and acts as an immunosuppressor during therapeutic cancer vaccination. Pharmacological inhibition of SRA function thus holds a great potential to improve treatment outcome of cancer therapy. Macromolecular natural product sennoside B was recently shown to block SRA function. Here we report the identification and characterization of a small molecule SRA inhibitor rhein. Rhein, a deconstructed analog of sennoside B, reversed the suppressive activity of SRA in dendritic cell-primed T cell activation, indicated by transcription activation of il2 gene and production of IL-2. Rhein also inhibited SRA ligand polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) induced activation of transcriptional factors, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Additionally, this newly identified lead compound was docked into the homology models of the SRA cysteine rich domain to gain insights into its interaction with the receptor. It was then found that rhein can favorably interact with SRA cysteine rich domain. Collectively, rhein, being the first identified small molecule inhibitors for SRA, warrants further structure-activity relationship studies, which may lead to development of novel pharmacological intervention for cancer therap.
ection triggers a series of signaling cascades, which converge to activate the transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby inducing the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs). Although not fully characterized, these innate antiviral responses are fine-tuned by dynamic ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes. In this study, we report ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 15 is involved in regulation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-dependent type I IFN induction pathway. Knockdown of endogenous USP15 augmented cellular antiviral responses. Overexpression of USP15 inhibited the transcription of IFN-β. Further analyses identified histidine 862 as a critical residue for USP15's catalytic activity. Interestingly, USP15 specifically removed lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I among the essential components in RIG-I-like receptor-dependent pathway. In addition, we demonstrated that in contrast to USP15 de-ubiquitinating (DUB) activity, USP15-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling was not abolished by mutations eliminating the catalytic activity, indicating that a fraction of USP15-mediated IFN antagonism was independent of the DUB activity. Catalytically inactive USP15 mutants, as did the wild-type protein, disrupted virus-induced interaction of RIG-I and IFN-β promoter stimulator 1. Taken together, our data demonstrate that USP15 acts as a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling via DUB-dependent and independent mechanism.
lator of interferon genes (STING) induces the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in response to intracellular viral double-stranded (ds) DNA. The aim of this study was to evaluate mRNA levels of STING and its downstream transcription factor, IRF3, in the isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic HBV (CHB) infectio.
y was performed on 60 healthy controls and 60 CHB patients. The mRNA levels of STING and IRF3 were determined using Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The SPSS software version 18 was used to analyze raw dat.
ts revealed that mRNA levels of STING were significantly decreased in CHB patients in comparison to healthy controls (P = 0.013). Our results also revealed that expression levels of IRF3 were not different between CHB patients and healthy controls (P = 0.828.
esent study, we found that CHB patients were unable to express appropriate levels of STING. Thus, it may result in impairment of HBV-DNA recognition and subsequently disruption of immune responses. These results suggest a plausible mechanism which may partially define the fact that immune responses are impaired in CHB patient.
synthesized benzenediamine derivate, was reported to regulate Toll-like receptor 9-induced activation of dendritic cells in our previous study. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory properties of FC-98 both in macrophages and in septic mouse models. By using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time quantitative PCR, we found that FC-98 (6.25, 25 and 100μM) dose-dependently attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) productions in RAW264.7 and primary mouse peritoneal macrophages. These inhibitory effects were not due to inducing cell cytotoxicity or altering LPS binding or TLR4 expression. Subsequently, western blot, immunofluorescence and luciferase reporter assays were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of its anti-inflammatory activities. Results showed that FC-98 blocked activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathways. In vivo, FC-98 (30 or 100mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administrated into LPS-induced or CLP-induced sepsis mice. It was observed to enhance the survival rate, inhibit pro-inflammatory mediator production, improve organ injuries and suppress bacterial propagation. In conclusion, FC-98 effectively inhibited macrophage inflammatory responses and ameliorated sepsis in mice through down-regulation of both MyD88 and TRIF-dependent pathways. These results suggest that FC-98 could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory disease.
tudy, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) strain, PRRSV GD07 was continuously propagated in MARC-145 cell cultures primed with swIFN-β for 50 passages to develop the PRRSV GDβfn strains. And a control strain PRRSV GDfn was passaged without swIFN-β. The sequencing analysis indicated that under swIFN-β immune pressure, molecular variation of PRRSV GP5 was accelerated in gene (NS/S&gt;2.50), and the acceleration of GP3 was not significant (NS/S&lt;2.50). swIFN-β mRNA level induced by Poly(I:C) is lower in cells primed with PRRSV GDβfn than in cells without PRRSV GDfn, although both of them are much less than the control group. Effect of GP5 on IRF3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western-blot. Our results indicated that GP5 protein prevents IRF3 phosphorylation. Therefore, we conclude that swIFN can promote viral mutation in GP5, and, in turn GP5 inhibits IRF3 activation to escape from swIFN-.
 receptors (TLRs) recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns and play a critical role in innate immune responses. TLR signaling pathways can be largely classified as either myeloid differential factor 88 (MyD88)- or toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent pathways. Compound of Designation red 10 binding (CDr10b) was synthesized to investigate its role in neuroinflammatory diseases. This study was conducted to determine whether CDr10b can affect TLR signaling pathways. CDr10b suppressed NF-κB activation as well as COX-2 and iNOS expression induced by TLR3 or TLR4 agonists. CDr10b also suppressed the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the expression of interferon inducible protein-10 (IP-10) induced by TLR3 or TLR4 agonists. These results indicate that CDr10b can modulate the TRIF-dependent pathway of TLRs and has the potential to become a new therapeutic drug for chronic inflammatory disease.
cellular localization plays a crucial role in the effective function of most signaling proteins, and nuclear trafficking is central to the function of transcription factors. IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 is a master transcription factor responsible for the induction of type I IFN, which plays a crucial role in host antiviral innate immune responses. However, the mechanisms for control and regulation of IRF3 nuclear import largely remain to be elucidated. In our study, we identified a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in IRF3, with two interdependent basic clusters separated by a 7-aa linker. Our study further demonstrated that the bipartite NLS of IRF3 is also critical for IRF3 DNA-binding activity, indicating that the two functions of this region are integrated, which is in contrast to other IRFs. Furthermore, the IFN bioassay and infection studies suggest that IRF3 NLS is essential to the IRF3-mediated IFN responses and antiviral immunity. Overall, our results reveal a previously unrecognized bipartite NLS for IRF3 that contains both DNA-binding activity and nuclear import function, and they shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of IRF3 activation and IRF3-mediated antiviral response.
ing kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated induction of type I interferon (IFN) plays a critical role in host antiviral responses and immune homeostasis. The negative regulation of TBK1 activity is largely unknown. We report that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) inhibits the IFN-β signaling pathway by promoting proteasomal degradation of TBK1. Overexpression and knockdown experiments indicated that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and IFN-β transcription. Moreover, SOCS3 directly associates with TBK1, and they colocalize in the cytoplasm. SOCS3 catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 at Lys341 and Lys344 and promotes subsequent TBK1 degradation. On the contrary, SOCS3 knockdown markedly increases the abundance of TBK1. Interestingly, both the BOX domain of SOCS3 and Ser172 phosphorylation of TBK1 are indispensable for the processes of ubiquitination and degradation. Ectopic expression of SOCS3 significantly inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus strain A/WSN/33 (WSN)-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and facilitates the replication of WSN virus by detecting the transcription of its viral RNA (vRNA). Knockdown of SOCS3 represses WSN replication. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SOCS3 acts as a negative regulator of IFN-β signal by ubiquitinating and degrading TBK1, shed light on the understanding of antiviral innate immunity, and provide a potential target for developing antiviral agent.
asion into a host is initially recognized by the innate immune system, mainly through activation of the intracellular cytosolic signaling pathway and coordinated activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors that promote type I interferon gene induction. The TANK-binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylates and activates IRF3. Here, we show that Optineurin (Optn) dampens the antiviral innate immune response by targeting the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD to TBK1 in order to inhibit its enzymatic activity. Importantly, we found that this regulatory mechanism is abolished at the G2/M phase as a consequence of the nuclear translocation of CYLD and Optn. As a result, we observed, at this cell division stage, an increased activity and phosphorylation of TBK1 that lead to its relocalization to mitochondria and to enhanced interferon production, suggesting that this process, which relies on Optn function, might be of major importance to mount a preventive antiviral response during mitosi.
e immune response is largely initiated by pathogen-responsive activation of the transcription factor IRF3. Among other target genes, IRF3 controls the expression of IFN-β, which triggers the activation of the transcription factor ISGF3 via the IFNAR. IRF3 and ISGF3 have been reported to control many of the same target genes and together, control the antimicrobial innate-immune program; however, their respective contributions and specificities remain unclear. Here, we used genomic technologies to characterize their specificity in terms of their physical DNA-binding and genetic function. With the use of ChiP-seq and transcriptomic measurements in WT versus ifnar(-/-) versus ifnar(-/-)irf3(-/-) macrophages responding to intracellular dsRNA, we confirmed the known ISGF3 DNA-binding motif and further specified a distinct IRF3 consensus sequence. The functional specificity of IRF3 is particularly pronounced in cytokine/chemokine regulation; yet, even in the control of IFN-β, that specificity is not absolute. By mathematically modeling IFN-β production within an abstracted tissue layer, we find that IRF3 versus ISGF3 specificity may be critical to limiting IFN-β production and ISGF3 activation, temporally and spatially, but that partial overlap in their specificity is tolerable and may enhance the effectiveness of the innate-immune respons.
21) translocation is the most common genetic rearrangement in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and gives rise to the TEL-AML1 fusion gene. Many studies on TEL-AML1 describe specific properties of the fusion protein, but a thorough understanding of its function is lacking. We exploited a pluripotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line, EML1, and generated a cell line (EML-TA) stably expressing the TEL-AML1 fusion protein. EML1 cells differentiate to mature B-cells following treatment with IL7; whereas EML-TA display an impaired differentiation capacity and remain blocked at an early stage of maturation. Global gene expression profiling of EML1 cells at different stages of B-lymphoid differentiation, compared with EML-TA, identified the interferon (IFN)α/β pathway as a primary target of repression by TEL-AML1. In particular, expression and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was decreased in EML-TA cells; strikingly, stable expression of IRF3 restored the capacity of EML-TA cells to differentiate into mature B-cells. Similarly, IRF3 silencing in EML1 cells by siRNA was sufficient to block B-lymphoid differentiation. The ability of TEL-AML1 to block B-cell differentiation and downregulate the IRF3-IFNα/β pathway was confirmed in mouse and human primary hematopoietic precursor cells (Lin- and CD34+ cells, respectively), and in a patient-derived cell line expressing TEL-AML1 (REH). Furthermore, treatment of TEL-AML1 expressing cells with IFNα/β was sufficient to overcome the maturation block. Our data provide new insight on TEL-AML1 function and may offer a new therapeutic opportunity for B-ALL.Oncogene advance online publication, 20 April 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.5.
r type I interferon (IFN) responses, pattern recognition receptors activate signaling cascades that lead to transcription of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been implicated in these responses, although its role has not been defined. Here, we show that PML isoform II (PML-II) is specifically required for efficient induction of IFN-β transcription and of numerous ISGs, acting at the point of transcriptional complex assembly on target gene promoters. PML-II associated with specific transcription factors NF-κB and STAT1, as well as the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), to facilitate transcriptional complex formation. The absence of PML-II substantially reduced binding of these factors and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to IFN-β or ISGs promoters and sharply reduced gene activation. The unique C-terminal domain of PML-II was essential for its activity, while the N-terminal RBCC motif common to all PML isoforms was dispensable. We propose a model in which PML-II contributes to the transcription of multiple genes via the association of its C-terminal domain with relevant transcription complexes, which promotes the stable assembly of these complexes at promoters/enhancers of target genes, and that in this way PML-II plays a significant role in the development of type I IFN response.
terferons (IFNs-α/β) play a key role for the antiviral state of host, and the porcine arterivirus; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), has been shown to down-regulate the production of IFNs during infection. Non-structural protein (nsp) 1 of PRRSV has been identified as a viral IFN antagonist, and the nsp1α subunit of nsp1 has been shown to degrade the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and to inhibit the formation of enhanceosome thus resulting in the suppression of IFN production. The study was expanded to other member viruses in the family Arteriviridae: equine arteritis virus (EAV), murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). While PRRSV-nsp1 and LDV-nsp1 were auto-cleaved to produce the nsp1α and nsp1β subunits, EAV-nsp1 remained uncleaved. SHFV-nsp1 was initially predicted to be cleaved to generate three subunits (nsp1α, nsp1β, and nsp1γ), but only two subunits were generated as SHFV-nsp1αβ and SHFV-nsp1γ. The papain-like cysteine protease (PLP) 1α motif in nsp1α remained inactive for SHFV, and only the PLP1β motif of nsp1β was functional to generate SHFV-nsp1γ subunit. All subunits of arterivirus nsp1 were localized in the both nucleus and cytoplasm, but PRRSV-nsp1β, LDV-nsp1β, EAV-nsp1, and SHFV-nsp1γ were predominantly found in the nucleus. All subunits of arterivirus nsp1 contained the IFN suppressive activity and inhibited both interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB mediated IFN promoter activities. Similar to PRRSV-nsp1α, CBP degradation was evident in cells expressing LDV-nsp1α and SHFV-nsp1γ, but no such degradation was observed for EAV-nsp1. Regardless of CBP degradation, all subunits of arterivirus nsp1 suppressed the IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE)-promoter activities. Our data show that the nsp1-mediated IFN modulation is a common strategy for all arteriviruses but their mechanism of action may differ from each othe.
s activate innate immune signaling pathways to defend against invading pathogens. To survive within an infected host, viruses have evolved intricate strategies to counteract host immune responses. Herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), have large genomes and therefore have the capacity to encode numerous proteins that modulate host innate immune responses. Here we define the contribution of HSV-1 tegument protein VP16 in the inhibition of beta interferon (IFN-β) production. VP16 was demonstrated to significantly inhibit Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-β production, and its transcriptional activation domain was not responsible for this inhibition activity. Additionally, VP16 blocked the activation of the NF-κB promoter induced by SeV or tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment and expression of NF-κB-dependent genes through interaction with p65. Coexpression analysis revealed that VP16 selectively blocked IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3)-mediated but not IRF-7-mediated transactivation. VP16 was able to bind to IRF-3 but not IRF-7 in vivo, based on coimmunoprecipitation analysis, but it did not affect IRF-3 dimerization, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding activity. Rather, VP16 interacted with the CREB binding protein (CBP) coactivator and efficiently inhibited the formation of the transcriptional complexes IRF-3-CBP in the context of HSV-1 infection. These results illustrate that VP16 is able to block the production of IFN-β by inhibiting NF-κB activation and interfering with IRF-3 to recruit its coactivator CBP, which may be important to the early events leading to HSV-1 infectio.
n (IFN) is required for protecting mice from viral pathogenesis; reciprocally, it mediates the deleterious septic shock response to bacterial infection. The critical transcription factor for IFN induction, in both cases, is IRF-3, which is activated by TLR3 or RIG-I signaling in response to virus infection and TLR4 signaling in response to bacterial infection. Here, we report that IRF-3's transcriptional activity required its coactivators, β-catenin and CBP, to be modified by HDAC6-mediated deacetylation and protein kinase C isozyme β (PKC-β)-mediated phosphorylation, respectively, so that activated nuclear IRF-3 could form a stable transcription initiation complex at the target gene promoters. β-Catenin bridges IRF-3 and CBP, and the modifications were required specifically for the interaction between β-catenin and CBP but not β-catenin and IRF-3. Consequently, like IRF-3(-/-) mice, HDAC6(-/-) mice were resistant to bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Conversely, they were highly susceptible to pathogenesis caused by Sendai virus infection. Thus, HDAC6 is an essential component of the innate immune response to microbial infectio.
ally disordered proteins are renowned for their structural plasticity when they undergo coupled folding and binding to partner proteins. The nuclear coactivator binding domain of CBP is a remarkable example of this adaptability as it folds into two different conformations depending on the binding partner. To understand the role of the conformational ensemble for plasticity in ligand recognition, we investigated the millisecond dynamics of this domain using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy. All NMR signals originating from the domain are broadened, demonstrating that the whole domain experience conformational exchange. The dispersion data can be described by a global two-state exchange process between a ground state and an excited state populated to 8%. The three helices are still folded in the excited state but have a different packing from the ground state; the contact between helices 2 and 3 found in the ground state is broken in the excited state, and a new one is formed between helices 1 and 3. This suggests that while NCBD in the ground state has a structure similar to the complex with the ligand ACTR, the conformation of NCBD in the excited state has some similarity with that of NCBD in complex with the ligand IRF-3. The energy landscape of this domain is thus proposed to resemble the fold-switching proteins that have two coexisting native states, which may serve as a starting point for binding via conformational selectio.
ity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor transcription factor belonging to subclass 3C of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, is typically triggered by glucocorticoid hormones. Apart from driving gene transcription via binding onto glucocorticoid response elements in regulatory regions of particular target genes, GR can also inhibit gene expression via transrepression, a mechanism largely based on protein:protein interactions. Hereby GR can influence the activity of other transcription factors, without contacting DNA itself. GR is known to inhibit the activity of a growing list of immune-regulating transcription factors. Hence, GCs still rule the clinic for treatments of inflammatory disorders, notwithstanding concomitant deleterious side effects. Although patience is a virtue when it comes to deciphering the many mechanisms GR uses to influence various signaling pathways, the current review is testimony of the fact that groundbreaking mechanistic work has been accumulating over the past years and steadily continues to gro.
 (miRNAs), a family of small nonprotein-coding RNAs, play a critical role in posttranscriptional gene regulation by acting as adaptors for the miRNA-induced silencing complex to inhibit gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational repression and/or cleavage. miR-155-5p and miR-155-3p are processed from the B-cell Integration Cluster (BIC) gene (now designated, MIR155 host gene or MIR155HG). MiR-155-5p is highly expressed in both activated B- and T-cells and in monocytes/macrophages. MiR-155-5p is one of the best characterized miRNAs and recent data indicate that miR-155-5p plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes such as hematopoietic lineage differentiation, immunity, inflammation, viral infections, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Down syndrome. In this review we summarize the mechanisms by which MIR155HG expression can be regulated. Given that the pathologies mediated by miR-155-5p result from the over-expression of this miRNA it may be possible to therapeutically attenuate miR-155-5p levels in the treatment of several pathological processe.
ion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in a conserved stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Macrophages undergoing a UPR respond to LPS with log-fold increased production of IFN-beta, a cytokine with diverse roles in innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we found that thapsigargin-induced ER stress augmented recruitment of IFN regulatory factor-3, CREB binding protein/p300, and transcriptional machinery to the murine ifnb1 promoter during LPS stimulation. Although full synergistic IFN-beta production requires X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), this UPR-regulated transcription factor did not appreciably bind the ifnb1 promoter. However, XBP-1 bound a conserved site 6.1 kb downstream of ifnb1, along with IFN regulatory factor-3 and CREB binding protein only during concomitant UPR and LPS stimulation. XBP-1 physically associates with p300, suggesting a mechanism of multimolecular assembly at the +6.1 kb site. Luciferase reporter assays provide evidence this +6 kb region functions as an XBP-1-dependent enhancer of ifnb1 promoter activity. Thus, this study identifies a novel role for a UPR-dependent transcription factor in the regulation of an inflammatory cytokine. Our findings have broader mechanistic implications for the pathogenesis of diseases involving ER stress and type I IFN, including viral infection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, protein misfolding, and inflammatory disease.
eproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an emerged disease of swine characterized by negligible response of type I IFNs and viral persistence. We show that the PRRSV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is the viral component responsible for modulation of IFN response. Nsp1 blocked dsRNA-induced IRF3 and IFN promoter activities. Nsp1 did not block phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 but inhibited IRF3 association with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. While IRF3 was stable, CBP was degraded, and CBP degradation was proteasome-dependent, suggesting that CBP degradation is not due to the protease activity of Nsp1 but an intermediary is involved. Our data suggest that the Nsp1-mediated CBP degradation inhibits the recruitment of CBP for enhanceosome assembly, leading to the block of IFN response. CBP degradation is a novel strategy for viral evasion from the host response, and Nsp1 may form a new class of viral antagonists for IFN modulatio.
s respond to viral infections by synthesizing and producing antiviral molecules such as type I interferons (IFN). The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes multiple proteins expressed during the lytic replication cycle that alter the antiviral response of the host. Considering that in Kaposi sarcoma lesions and primary effusion lymphoma cells KSHV is latent in the vast majority of cells, we were interested in determining whether latently expressed viral proteins have the ability to modulate IFN synthesis. The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA-1) is a large nuclear protein that plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of latent KSHV episome in the nucleus of infected cells. LANA-1 is also described to modulate the cellular transcription. Here, we report that LANA-1 inhibits IFN-beta transcription and synthesis by competing with the binding of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) to the IFNB promoter. Using mutants of LANA-1, we have identified the central acidic repeated region as the domain essential for interfering with the binding of IRF3 to the positive regulatory domains I-III of the IFNB promoter. In addition, the nuclear localization of LANA-1 proved essential for IFN-beta inhibition. Thus, LANA-1 interferes with the formation of IFN-beta enhanceosome by competing with the fixation of IRF3 and by inhibiting the expression of the CREB-binding protein. The ability of LANA-1 to inhibit IFNB gene expression highlights a new role for this protein in cellular gene modulation and immune evasion strategie.
be here Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) as an interferon (IFN)-alpha antagonist counteracting the transactivation function of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). Co-expression of Tax, but not the Tax mutant unable to bind to CBP, significantly inhibited the reporter gene expression directed by IFN-stimulated regulatory elements, despite that the formation of DNA-binding ISGF3 complex was unaffected. Gene activation induced by STAT2 transcription domain was also inhibited by expression of Tax. Furthermore, Tax-mediated transcriptional inhibition was reversed by overexpression of p300. These observations indicate that Tax interferes with IFN-alpha-induced JAK-STAT pathway by competition with STAT2 for CBP/p300 binding. Consistently, GST pull-down assay showed that Tax dose-dependently inhibited binding of STAT2 to p300. This study suggests that Tax may prevent IFN-alpha from exerting its antiviral, antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, thereby contributing to persistent viral infection and HTLV-1-associated oncogenesi.
member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, functions in innate immune defense against viral infection. Upon infection, host cell IRF-3 is activated by phosphorylation at its seven C-terminal Ser/Thr residues: (385)SSLENTVDLHISNSHPLSLTS(405). This phosphoactivation triggers IRF-3 to react with the coactivators, CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, to form a complex that activates target genes in the nucleus. However, the role of each phosphorylation site for IRF-3 phosphoactivation remains unresolved. To address this issue, all seven Ser/Thr potential phosphorylation sites were screened by mutational studies, size-exclusion chromatography, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Using purified proteins, we show that CBP (amino acid residues 2067-2112) interacts directly with IRF-3 (173-427) and six of its single-site mutants to form heterodimers, but when CBP interacts with IRF-3 S396D, oligomerization is evident. CBP also interacts in vitro with IRF-3 double-site mutants to form different levels of oligomerization. Among all the single-site mutants, IRF-3 S396D showed the strongest binding to CBP. Although IRF-3 S386D alone did not interact as strongly with CBP as did other mutants, it strengthened the interaction and oligomerization of IRF-3 S396D with CBP. In contrast, IRF-3 S385D weakened the interaction and oligomerization of IRF-3 S396D and S386/396D with CBP. Thus, it appears that Ser385 and Ser386 serve antagonistic functions in regulating IRF-3 phosphoactivation. These results indicate that Ser386 and Ser396 are critical for IRF-3 activation, and support a phosphorylation-oligomerization model for IRF-3 activatio.
n regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes. IRF3 is constitutively present in a latent conformation in the cell cytoplasm. In cells infected by Sendai virus, IRF3 becomes phosphorylated, homodimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, binds to target genes and activates transcription by interacting with CBP/p300 co-activators. In this study, we report that in non-infected cells IRF3 is post-translationally modified by S-glutathionylation. Upon viral-infection, it undergoes a deglutathionylation step that is controlled by the cytoplasmic enzyme glutaredoxin-1 (GRX-1). In virus-infected GRX-1 knockdown cells, phosphorylation, homodimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were not affected, but the transcriptional activity of IRF3 and the expression of interferon-beta (IFNbeta), were severely reduced. We show that deglutathionylation of IRF3 is necessary for efficient interaction of IRF3 with CBP, an event essential for transcriptional activation of the interferon genes. Taken together, these findings reveal a crucial role for S-glutathionylation and GRX-1 in controlling the activation of IRF3 and IFNbeta gene expressio.
talloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) displays a preference for a broad range of substrates including extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines. MMP-9 plays an important role in physiological processes, as well as in inflammatory diseases and numerous cancers. Interferon-beta is a pleiotropic cytokine with antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities. Interferon-beta positively regulates gene expression, predominantly through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. However, little is known about the mechanisms used by interferon-beta to negatively regulate gene expression. In the present study, we show that interferon-beta inhibits MMP-9 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Using cell lines deficient in three components of the interferon-beta-activated interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex (i.e. STAT-1, STAT-2 and interferon regulatory factor 9), the results of our study indicate that all three members are required for interferon-beta inhibition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that interferon-beta reduces recruitment of transcriptional activators and coactivators, such as nuclear factor kappa B p65, Sp1, CREB-binding protein and p300, to the MMP-9 promoter, and decreases the degree of histone acetylation at the MMP-9 promoter. This occurs in the absence of an association of the ISGF3 complex with the MMP-9 promoter. Taken together, these data define the role of interferon-beta and the ISGF3 members in suppressing MMP-9 gene expressio.
activated receptors initiate intracellular signaling by recruiting protein kinases that phosphorylate the receptors on tyrosine residues, thus enabling docking of SH2 domain-bearing activating factors. Here we report that in response to type 1 interferon (IFNalpha), IFNalpha receptors recruit cytoplasmic CREB-binding protein (CBP). By binding to IFNalphaR2 within the region where two adjacent proline boxes bear phospho-Ser364 and phospho-Ser384, CBP acetylates IFNalphaR2 on Lys399, which in turn serves as the docking site for interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). IRF9 interacts with the acetyl-Lys399 motif by means of its IRF homology2 (IH2) domain, leading to formation of the ISGF3 complex that includes IRF9, STAT1, and STAT2. All three components are acetylated by CBP. Remarkably, acetylation within the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of both IRF9 and STAT2 is critical for the ISGF3 complex activation and its associated antiviral gene regulation. These results have significant implications concerning the central role of acetylation in cytokine receptor signal transductio.
cription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) regulates genes in the innate immune response. IRF-3 is activated through phosphorylation by the kinases IKK epsilon and/or TBK1. Phosphorylation results in IRF-3 dimerization and removal of an autoinhibitory structure to allow interaction with the coactivators CBP/p300. The precise role of the different phosphorylation sites has remained controversial. Using purified proteins we show that TBK1 can directly phosphorylate full-length IRF-3 in vitro. Phosphorylation at residues in site 2 (Ser(396)-Ser(405)) alleviates autoinhibition to allow interaction with CBP (CREB-binding protein) and facilitates phosphorylation at site 1 (Ser(385) or Ser(386)). Phosphorylation at site 1 is, in turn, required for IRF-3 dimerization. The data support a two-step phosphorylation model for IRF-3 activation mediated by TBK.
inase C (PKC) isoforms are critically involved in the regulation of innate immune responses. Herein, we investigated the role of conventional PKCalpha in the regulation of IFN-beta gene expression mediated by the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway. Inhibition of conventional PKC (cPKC) activity in monocyte-derived dendritic cells or TLR3-expressing cells by an isoform-specific inhibitor, Gö6976, selectively inhibited IFN-beta synthesis induced by double-stranded RNA polyinosine-polycytidylic acid. Furthermore, reporter gene assays confirmed that PKCalpha regulates IFN-beta promoter activity, since overexpression of dominant negative PKCalpha but not PKCbeta(I) repressed interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3)-dependent but not NF-kappaB-mediated promoter activity upon TLR3 engagement in HEK 293 cells. Dominant negative PKCalpha inhibited IRF-3 transcriptional activity mediated by overexpression of TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-beta and Tank-binding kinase-1. Additional biochemical analysis demonstrated that Gö6976-treated dendritic cells exhibited IRF-3 phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding activity analogous to their control counterparts in response to polyinosine-polycytidylic acid. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that TLR3-induced cPKC activity is essential for mediating the interaction of IRF-3 but not p65/RelA with the co-activator CREB-binding protein. Furthermore, PKCalpha knock-down with specific small interfering RNA inhibited IFN-beta expression and down-regulated IRF-3-dependent promoter activity, establishing PKCalpha as a component of TLR3 signaling that regulates IFN-beta gene expression by targeting IRF-3-CREB-binding protein interaction. Finally, we analyzed the involvement of cPKCs in other signaling pathways leading to IFN-beta synthesis. These experiments revealed that cPKCs play a role in the synthesis of IFN-beta induced via both TLR-dependent and -independent pathway.
feron (IFN) response is the earliest host immune response dedicated to combating viral infection. As such, viruses have evolved strategies to subvert this potent antiviral response. Two closely related gammaherpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV), are unique in that they express viral homologues to cellular interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), termed viral IRFs (vIRFs). Cellular IRFs are a family of transcription factors that are particularly important for the transcription of type I IFNs. Here, we demonstrate a strategy employed by RRV to ensure rapid inhibition of virus-induced type I IFN induction. We found that RRV vIRF R6, when expressed ectopically, interacts with a transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP), in the nucleus. As a result, phosphorylated IRF3, an important transcriptional regulator in beta interferon (IFN-β) transcription, fails to effectively bind to the IFN-β promoter, thus inhibiting the activation of IFN-β genes. In addition, we found R6 within RRV virion particles via immunoelectron microscopy and, furthermore, that virion-associated R6 is capable of inhibiting the type I IFN response by preventing efficient binding of IRF3/CBP complexes to the IFN-β promoter in the context of infection. The work shown here is the first example of a vIRF being associated with either the KSHV or RRV virion. The presence of this immunomodulatory protein in the RRV virion provides the virus with an immediate mechanism to evade the host IFN response, thus enabling the virus to effectively establish an infection within the hos.
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and the closely related rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) are the only viruses known to encode viral homologues to cellular interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), known as vIRFs. In KSHV, these proteins have been shown to play major roles in a variety of cellular processes and are particularly important in the evasion of the host type I interferon (IFN) response. In this study, we delineate the immunomodulatory mechanism of an RRV vIRF and its ability to assist the virus in rapid immune evasion by being prepackaged within the virion, thus providing evidence, for the first time, of a virion-associated vIRF. This work further contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms behind immunomodulation by the RRV vIRFs during infectio.
agement with macrophages activates Toll-Like-Receptors (TLRs) and viruses must contend with the ensuing inflammatory responses to successfully complete their replication cycle. To date, known counter-strategies involve the use of viral-encoded proteins that often employ mimicry mechanisms to block or redirect the host response to benefit the virus. Whether viral regulatory DNA sequences provide an opportunistic strategy by which viral enhancer elements functionally mimic innate immune enhancers is unknown. Here we find that host innate immune genes and the prototypical viral enhancer of cytomegalovirus (CMV) have comparable expression kinetics, and positively respond to common TLR agonists. In macrophages but not fibroblasts we show that activation of NFκB at immediate-early times of infection is independent of virion-associated protein, M45. We find upon virus infection or transfection of viral genomic DNA the TLR-agonist treatment results in significant enhancement of the virus transcription-replication cycle. In macrophage time-course infection experiments we demonstrate that TLR-agonist stimulation of the viral enhancer and replication cycle is strictly delimited by a temporal gate with a determined half-maximal time for enhancer-activation of 6 h; after which TLR-activation blocks the viral transcription-replication cycle. By performing a systematic siRNA screen of 149 innate immune regulatory factors we identify not only anticipated anti-viral and pro-viral contributions but also new factors involved in the CMV transcription-replication cycle. We identify a central convergent NFκB-SP1-RXR-IRF axis downstream of TLR-signalling. Activation of the RXR component potentiated direct and indirect TLR-induced activation of CMV transcription-replication cycle; whereas chromatin binding experiments using wild-type and enhancer-deletion virus revealed IRF3 and 5 as new pro-viral host transcription factor interactions with the CMV enhancer in macrophages. In a series of pharmacologic, siRNA and genetic loss-of-function experiments we determined that signalling mediated by the TLR-adaptor protein MyD88 plays a vital role for governing the inflammatory activation of the CMV enhancer in macrophages. Downstream TLR-regulated transcription factor binding motif disruption for NFκB, AP1 and CREB/ATF in the CMV enhancer demonstrated the requirement of these inflammatory signal-regulated elements in driving viral gene expression and growth in cells as well as in primary infection of neonatal mice. Thus, this study shows that the prototypical CMV enhancer, in a restricted time-gated manner, co-opts through DNA regulatory mimicry elements, innate-immune transcription factors to drive viral expression and replication in the face of on-going pro-inflammatory antiviral responses in vitro and in vivo and; suggests an unexpected role for inflammation in promoting acute infection and has important future implications for regulating latenc.
 infection results in expression of type 1 IFNs, especially IFN-alpha/beta, which play a crucial role in host antivirus responses. Type 1 IFNs are induced in a cell type-specific manner through TLR and RIG-I-like receptor pathways, both of which activate IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) and NF-kappaB transcription factors. Although NF-kappaB activation and association with the IFN-beta promoter after RNA virus infection is well documented, our previous work showed that, surprisingly, NF-kappaB is not essential for IFN-beta gene expression. Thus, the actual function of NF-kappaB in IFN-beta expression and virus replication is not clear. In this study, we found Newcastle disease virus and vesicular stomatitis virus replication is enhanced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the NF-kappaB RelA subunit. Increased virus replication was traced to a specific requirement for RelA in early virus-induced IFN-beta expression. At these time points, when IFN-beta expression is ~100-fold less than peak levels, impaired IFN-beta production delayed IFN-induced gene expression, resulting in increased virus replication in RelA(-/-) MEFs. Importantly, our results show that RelA requirement is crucial only when IRF3 activation is low. Thus, high levels of activated IRF3 expression are sufficient for induction of IFN-beta in RelA(-/-) MEFs, transcriptional synergism with the coactivator CREB-binding protein, and rescue of susceptibility to virus. Together, these findings indicate that NF-kappaB RelA is not crucial for regulating overall IFN-beta production, as previously believed; instead, RelA is specifically required only during a key early phase after virus infection, which substantially impacts the host response to virus infectio.
esis of interferon-beta (IFNbeta) and IFN-inducible factors elicited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) depends on the transcriptional activity of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) downstream of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). To examine the ability of human newborns to mount TLR4-mediated IRF-3-dependent responses, we analyzed the pattern of genes expressed on the addition of LPS to cord blood or cord blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Expression of IFNbeta and IFN-inducible genes was selectively impaired in neonatal blood and moDCs as compared with their adult counterparts. This selective defect was confirmed by microarray experiments on moDCs. Altered expression of IFN-inducible genes was related to impaired IFNbeta synthesis because IFNbeta signaling was functional in neonatal moDCs. However, addition of exogenous IFNbeta failed to restore LPS-induced IL-12p70 synthesis which was previously shown to be defective in neonatal moDCs. Although LPS-induced IRF-3 nuclear translocation was observed both in adult and neonatal moDCs, IRF-3 DNA-binding activity and association with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) were decreased in neonatal as compared with adult moDCs. We conclude that impaired IRF-3/CBP interaction in neonatal blood cells exposed to LPS is associated with impaired expression of IFNbeta and IFN-inducible genes. Because IRF-3 activity is also required for IL-12p70 synthesis, our findings provide a molecular basis for the decreased ability of LPS-stimulated neonatal moDCs to elicit Th1-type response.
terize the mechanisms underlying apoptosis induced by viral infection, transcriptional activation of genes encoding members of the 'BH3-only' family of proteins was analysed during the course of virus infection. Among these genes, only NOXA is transcriptionally activated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), sendai virus (SV), measles virus, herpes simplex virus, or dsRNA and required for efficient apoptosis of cells. Transcriptional activation of NOXA by VSV or SV is independent of p53, but requires the presence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), IRF-3 and cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Binding to and transactivation of the NOXA promoter by each of these transcription factors is governed by post-translational modification involving different pathways for each factor. Thus, SV infection activates IRF-3 and CREB by phosphorylation triggered by Toll like receptor 3 signalling, and a pathway involving calcium-independent phopholipase A2, respectively. In addition transactivation induced by IRF-1 during viral infection correlates with a 10 kDa increase in its molecular weight, suggesting a covalent linkage with a previously unknown regulatory polypeptid.
f the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family regulate gene expression critical to immune response, hemopoiesis, and proliferation. Although related by homology at their N-terminal DNA-binding domain, they display individual functional properties. The distinct properties result from differences in regulated expression, response to activating signals, and interaction with DNA regulatory elements. IRF-3 is expressed ubiquitously and is activated by serine phosphorylation in response to viral infection or TLR signaling. Evidence indicates that the kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 and inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase-epsilon specifically phosphorylate and thereby activate IRF-3. We evaluated the contribution of another member of the IRF family, IRF-5, during viral infection since prior studies provided varied results. Analysis of phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, dimerization, binding to CREB-binding protein, recognition of DNA, and induction of gene expression were used comparatively with IRF-3 as a measure of IRF-5 activation. IRF-5 was not activated by viral infection; however, expression of TANK-binding kinase 1 or inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase-epsilon did provide clear activation of IRF-5. IRF-5 is therefore distinct in its activation profile from IRF-3. However, similar to the biological effects of IRF-3 activation, a constitutively active mutation of IRF-5 promoted apoptosis. The apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Bcl-x(L) but not a dominant-negative mutation of the Fas-associated death domain. These studies support the distinct activation profiles of IRF-3 in comparison to IRF-5, but reveal a potential shared biological effec.
a member of the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and plays a principal role in the induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) by virus infection. Virus infection results in the phosphorylation of IRF-3 by IkappaB kinase epsilon and TANK-binding kinase 1, leading to its dimerization and association with the coactivators CREB-binding protein/p300. The IRF-3 holocomplex translocates to the nucleus, where it induces IFN-beta. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism of IRF-3 activation. Using bacterial two-hybrid screening, we isolated molecules that interact with IRF-3. One of these was cyclophilin B, a member of the immunophilins with a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. A GST pull-down assay suggested that one of the autoinhibition domains of IRF-3 and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain of cyclophilin B are required for the binding. A knockdown of cyclophilin B expression by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of virus-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition of the subsequent dimerization, association with CREB-binding protein, binding to the target DNA element, and induction of IFN-beta. These findings indicate that cyclophilin B plays a critical role in IRF-3 activatio.
taining an interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE) can be divided into two groups according to their inducibility by IFN and virus infection: one induced only by IFN and the other induced by both IFN and virus infection. Although it is now clear that IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is a multifunctional gene essential for induction of type I IFNs, regulation of the IRF7 promoter (IRF7p) is poorly understood. The IRF7 gene includes two IFN responsive elements, an IRF-binding element (IRFE) in the promoter region and an ISRE in the first intron, and is induced by the IFN-triggered Jak-STAT pathway by binding of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex to the ISRE. In this study, we demonstrate that IRF3 and IRF7, which with the coactivators CREB-binding protein and P300 form the virus-activated factor (VAF) complex upon Sendai virus infection, bind to the IRF7 ISRE and IRFE and can directly activate IRF7 transcription. Promoter reporter assays show that both the ISRE and IRFE are responsive to activation by IRF7 and IRF3. In cells transiently expressing IRF7 or/and IRF3, the VAF level and binding of VAF are clearly increased after Sendai virus infection. Studies with Jak1 kinase inactive 293 cells that were stably transfected with a Jak1 kinase dead dominant negative construct, and the mutant cell lines SAN (IFNalpha-/beta-), U2A (IRF9-), U4A (Jak1-), and DKO (IRF1-/IRF2-) show that the IRF7 transcription activated directly by VAF is distinct from and independent of the IFN signaling pathway. Thus, IRF7 transcription is autoregulated by binding of the IRF7-containing VAF to its own ISRE and IRFE. The results show two distinct mechanisms for the activation of the IRF7 promoter, by IFN and by virus infection. A regulatory network between type I IFNs and IRF7 is proposed. The distinct pathways may reflect special roles for an efficient antiviral response at different stages of virus infectio.
to virus (THOV) is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae. It prevents induction of alpha/beta interferons (IFN) in cell culture and in vivo via the action of the viral ML protein. Phenotypically, the effect of THOV ML resembles that of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (FLUAV) in that it blocks the expression of IFN genes. IFN expression depends on IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Upon activation, IRF3 forms homodimers and accumulates in the nucleus where it binds the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). Here, we show that expression of ML blocked the transcriptional activity of IRF3 after stimulation by virus infection. Further biochemical analysis revealed that ML acts by blocking IRF3 dimerization and association with CBP. Surprisingly, however, ML did not interfere with the nuclear transport of IRF3. Thus, the action of ML differs strikingly from that of FLUAV NS1 that prevents IFN induction by retaining IRF3 in the cytoplas.
ons between extracellular matrix (ECM) and mammary epithelial cells are critical for mammary gland homeostasis and apoptotic signaling. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcriptional regulator that promotes apoptosis during mammary gland involution and p53-independent apoptosis. We have recently shown that rapid cell surface tamoxifen (Tam) signaling promotes apoptosis in normal human mammary epithelial cells that were acutely damaged by expression of human papillomavirus type-16 E6 protein (*HMEC-E6). Apoptosis was mediated by recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the gamma-activating sequence (GAS) element of the IRF-1 promoter, induction of IRF-1 and caspase-1/-3 activation. Here, we show that growth factor-depleted, reconstituted ECM (rECM), similar to Tam, promotes apoptosis in *HMEC-E6 cells through induction of IRF-1. Apoptosis was temporally associated with recruitment of CBP to the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter, induction of IRF-1 expression and caspase-1/-3 activation. Small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of IRF-1 protein expression in *HMEC-E6 cells blocked (1) induction of IRF-1, (2) caspase-1/-3 activation and (3) apoptosis. These observations demonstrate that IRF-1 promotes rECM-mediated apoptosis and provide evidence that both rECM and rapid Tam signaling transcriptionally activate IRF-1 through recruitment of CBP to the IRF-1 GAS promoter comple.
viral type I interferon (IFN) response is initiated by the immediate induction of IFN beta, which is mainly controlled by the IFN-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). The signaling pathways mediating viral IRF-3 activation are only poorly defined. We show that the Rho GTPase Rac1 is activated upon virus infection and controls IRF-3 phosphorylation and activity. Inhibition of Rac1 leads to reduced IFN beta promoter activity and to enhanced virus production. As a downstream mediator of Rac signaling towards IRF-3, we have identified the kinase p21-activated kinase (PAK1). Furthermore, both Rac1 and PAK1 regulate the recently described IRF-3 activators, I kappa B kinase- and TANK-binding kinase-1, establishing a first canonical virus-induced IRF-3 activating pathwa.
ctivation of murine infection-A4 (IFNA4) gene transcription following viral infection requires the presence of four cooperating DNA sequences (denoted A to D), which make up the virus responsive element VRE-A4. The B, C, and D modules, when tandemized, form binding sites for the virus-induced factor (VIF), a multiprotein complex that is detected early after viral infection in the nuclei of mouse L929 cells. We now demonstrate that IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) is a component of VIF and that VIF is different from the previously identified virus-activated complexes containing IRF-3 and coactivators of transcription, such as CREB binding protein (CBP) or p300. We also show that the C module is critical for both IRF-3-mediated and virus-induced transcription of the murine IFNA4 gene. Consistently, DNase I footprinting experiments and EMSA performed with increasing amounts of recombinant GST-IRF-3(DBD) fusion proteins demonstrate that cooperativity between the modules facilitate the binding of IRF-3 and recruitment of transcription coactivators on the IFNA4 promoter. These results indicate that VIF differentially recognizes the virus-responsive modules of VRE-A4 and further actualize our previous model concerning the differential expression of murine IFNA gene.
tic cellular defense mechanism is triggered in response to viral dsRNA generated during the course of infection by many DNA and RNA viruses. We demonstrate that apoptosis induced by dsRNA or a paramyxovirus is independent of the action of interferon as it can proceed in a variety of cell lines and primary cells deficient in an interferon response. Initiation of apoptosis appears to be triggered by activation of a cellular transcription factor, the dsRNA-activated factor (DRAF1). DRAF1 is composed of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the transcriptional coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) or p300. We find that activation of IRF-3 in the absence of viral infection stimulates apoptosis. In addition, a negative interfering mutant blocks both target gene induction and apoptosis, demonstrating a requirement for gene expression by IRF-3/DRAF1 to promote apoptosis. IRF-3/DRAF1 target gene expression is also induced in response to a distinct apoptotic stimulus, the DNA damaging agent etoposide. The activity of the p53 tumor suppressor does not appear to be required for IRF-3/DRAF1-mediated apoptosi.
udies implicate the interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF) IRF-3 and IRF-7 as key activators of the alpha/beta IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) genes as well as the RANTES chemokine gene. Using coexpression analysis, the human IFNB, IFNA1, and RANTES promoters were stimulated by IRF-3 coexpression, whereas the IFNA4, IFNA7, and IFNA14 promoters were preferentially induced by IRF-7 only. Chimeric proteins containing combinations of different IRF-7 and IRF-3 domains were also tested, and the results provided evidence of distinct DNA binding properties of IRF-3 and IRF-7, as well as a preferential association of IRF-3 with the CREB binding protein (CBP) coactivator. Interestingly, some of these fusion proteins led to supraphysiological levels of IFN promoter activation. DNA binding site selection studies demonstrated that IRF-3 and IRF-7 bound to the 5'-GAAANNGAAANN-3' consensus motif found in many virus-inducible genes; however, a single nucleotide substitution in either of the GAAA half-site motifs eliminated IRF-3 binding and transactivation activity but did not affect IRF-7 interaction or transactivation activity. These studies demonstrate that IRF-3 possesses a restricted DNA binding site specificity and interacts with CBP, whereas IRF-7 has a broader DNA binding specificity that contributes to its capacity to stimulate delayed-type IFN gene expression. These results provide an explanation for the differential regulation of IFN-alpha/beta gene expression by IRF-3 and IRF-7 and suggest that these factors have complementary rather than redundant roles in the activation of the IFN-alpha/beta gene.
loned and sequenced 1398bp of the rat HFE gene promoter region. The alignment of the rat promoter HFE sequence with the HFE promoter sequence from human and mouse detected several highly conserved sequences present at orthologous or heterologous positions in the three species. Subsequent analysis of the conserved promoter sequences identified the presence of 10 novel transcription elements present in the promoter regions of the human, mouse and rat HFE genes (GATA, NF-IL6, AP1, AP2, CREB, PEA3, gamma-IRE, GFI1, HNF-3beta, HFH2). Different gel retardation analyses performed with rat-liver nuclear extracts have confirmed the presence of factors binding to some of these transcription elements. This represents the first data concerning the identification of potential transcriptional elements of the HFE promoter in these three species. The expression pattern of the transcription factors corresponding to the novel elements identified in the HFE promoter is consistent with the potential role of the HFE promoter in the transcription regulation and function of the HFE gene. Knowledge of the identified conserved elements in the HFE promoter from human, mouse and rat provides the basis for subsequent in-vitro or in-vivo studies leading to identification of the detailed mechanisms involved in the regulation of the iron metabolism and the design of potential future alternative therapie.
y of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) encodes DNA-binding transcription factors, some of which function as modulators of virus-induced signaling. The IRF-3 gene is constitutively expressed in many tissues and cell types, and neither virus infection nor IFN treatment enhances its transcription. In infected cells, however, IRF-3 protein is phosphorylated at the carboxyl terminus, which facilitates its binding to the CBP/p300 coactivator. In the present study, we demonstrate that overexpression of IRF-3 significantly enhances virus-mediated transcription of the IFNA and IFNB genes in infected cells as well as IFN synthesis. IRF-3-mediated activation of IFN genes depends in part on carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues, because a mutant with Ser/Thr to Ala substitutions activates the IFN promoter less efficiently. However, overexpression of IRF-3 in human 2FTGH cells alone results in the induction of an antiviral state, which depends on functional IFN signaling, because IRF-3 does not induce an antiviral state in mutant 2FTGH cells defective in either JAK-1 or p48 functions; also no antiviral effect of IRF-3 could be demonstrated in Vero cells that lack the IFNA and IFNB genes. This finding indicates that the observed antiviral activity of IRF-3 in 2FTGH cells results mainly from the induction of IFNs. Furthermore, E1A protein inhibited IRF-3-mediated stimulation of the IFNA4 promoter in transient expression assays; this inhibition could be reversed partially by overexpression of CBP/p300 and was not demonstrated with the mutant of E1A that does not bind p300. These results identify IRF-3 and CBP/p300 as integral components of the virus-induced complex that stimulates type 1 IFN gene transcription. The observation that adenovirus E1A antagonizes IRF-3 mediated activation suggests that E1A and IRF-3 may compete for binding to CBP/p300 and implicates a novel mechanism by which adenovirus may overcome the antiviral effects of the IFN pathwa.
pond to viral infection or double-stranded RNA with the transcriptional induction of a subset of alpha/beta interferon-stimulated genes by a pathway distinct from the interferon signal pathway. The transcriptional induction is mediated through a DNA sequence containing the alpha/beta interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). We previously identified a novel transcription factor, designated double-stranded RNA-activated factor 1 (DRAF1), that recognizes this response element. The DNA-binding specificity of DRAF1 correlates with transcriptional induction, thereby distinguishing it as a positive regulator of alpha/beta interferon-stimulated genes. Two of the components of DRAF1 have now been identified as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300. We demonstrate that IRF-3 preexists in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells and translocates to the nucleus following viral infection. Translocation of IRF-3 is accompanied by an increase in serine and threonine phosphorylation. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses of endogenous proteins demonstrate an association of IRF-3 with the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 only subsequent to infection. In addition, antibodies to the IRF-3, CBP, and p300 molecules react with DRAF1 bound to the ISRE target site of induced genes. The cellular response that leads to DRAF1 activation and specific gene expression may serve to increase host survival during viral infectio.
ing protein (CBP) and p300 contain modular domains that mediate protein-protein interactions with a wide variety of nuclear factors. A C-terminal domain of CBP (referred to as the SID) is responsible for interaction with the alpha-helical AD1 domain of p160 coactivators such as the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC1), and also other transcriptional regulators such as E1A, Ets-2, IRF3, and p53. Here we show that the pointed (PNT) domain of Ets-2 mediates its interaction with the CBP SID, and describe the effects of mutations in the SID on binding of Ets-2, E1A, and SRC1. In vitro binding studies indicate that SRC1, Ets-2 and E1A display mutually exclusive binding to the CBP SID. Consistent with this, we observed negative cross-talk between ERalpha/SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A proteins in reporter assays in transiently transfected cells. Transcriptional inhibition of Ets-2 or GAL4-AD1 activity by E1A was rescued by co-transfection with a CBP expression plasmid, consistent with the hypothesis that the observed inhibition was due to competition for CBP in vivo. Sequence comparisons revealed that SID-binding proteins contain a leucine-rich motif similar to the alpha-helix Aalpha1 of the SRC1 AD1 domain. Deletion mutants of E1A and Ets-2 lacking the conserved motif were unable to bind the CBP SID. Moreover, a peptide corresponding to this sequence competed the binding of full-length SRC1, Ets-2, and E1A proteins to the CBP SID. Thus, a leucine-rich amphipathic alpha-helix mediates mutually exclusive interactions of functionally diverse nuclear proteins with CB.
n regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 in mammals are known to be crucial in regulating the type I interferon (IFN) response to viral infection as part of transcriptional complexes binding to IRF-binding elements (IRF-Es) and interferon stimulatory response elements (ISREs) within IFN and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here we report the sequencing and characterization of full-length cDNA homologues of rainbow trout (rt)IRF7 and, for the first time in fish, IRF3. RtIRF3 consists of 2127 bp with a 159 bp 5'-UTR-containing two upstream AUGs and a 573 bp 3'-UTR. RtIRF7 was found to be 2055 bp, with a 102 bp 5'-UTR and a 705 bp 3'-UTR. The open reading frames (ORFs) translate into 464 amino acid and 415 amino acid proteins, respectively, each possessing a putative DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing a tryptophan cluster, which is characteristic of all IRF family members. The presence of putative IRF association domain (IAD)s, serine-rich C terminal domains (poorly conserved in trout IRF3), and phylogenetic analysis places the two genes in the IRF3 subfamily. Both genes were found to be upregulated by poly I:C, type I recombinant rainbow trout (r) IFN (second isoform, type I rIFN), type II rIFN (rIFNgamma), LPS, and rIL-1beta in the trout macrophage cell line, RTS-11. Poly I:C and type I rIFN also induced IRF3 and IRF7 expression in a trout fibroblast cell line (RTG-2). Transient transfection of RTG-2 cells with each IRF fused to GFP revealed a predominant cytoplasmic distribution found most intensely around the nucleus and, to a lesser extent, within cell nuclei. Transient transfection of rtIRF3 in the Mx-1-luciferase reporter cell line, RTG-P1, revealed a modest increase in luciferase activity relative to the vehicle control, which was lost in cells over-expressing a DBD-truncated form of rtIRF3. Both full-length and DBD-truncated forms of rtIRF7 increased reporter activity relative to the control, although to a non-significant extent. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) did not reveal a specific interaction between each IRF and the ISRE element found in the Mx-1 promoter, although the Mx-1 ISRE bound specifically to endogenous transcriptional complexes. These data support the premise that rtIRF3 and rtIRF7 are important molecules in the regulation of antiviral responses in fish, with the impact of rIFNgamma on rtIRF3/7 expression implying a role for these IRFs in immune processes other than type I IFN-driven antiviral response.
atory factor 7 (IRF7) is a major regulator of type I (αβ) IFN secretion. A growing body of evidence shows that IRF7 is involved in a wide variety of pathologic conditions in addition to infections; however, the detailed mechanism of IRF7 transactivation remains elusive. Our current knowledge of IRF7 transactivation is based on studies of IRF3, another major regulator of IFN-β secretion. IRF3 and IRF7 are closely related homologs with high sequence similarity in their C-terminal regions, and both proteins are activated by phosphorylation of a specific serine cluster (SC). Nevertheless, the functional domains of the two proteins are arranged in an inverted manner. We generated a model structure of the IRF7 C-terminal region using homology modeling and used it to guide subsequent functional domain studies. The model structure led to the identification of a tripod-helix structure containing the SC. Based on the model and experimental data, we hypothesized that phosphorylation-mediated IRF7 transactivation is controlled by a tripod-helix structure. Inducible IκB kinase binds a tripod-helix structure. Serial phosphorylation of the SC by the kinase liberates C-terminal helix from an inhibitory hydrophobic pocket. A histone acetyltransferase P300 binds the liberated helix. The difference in the P300 binding sites explains why the domain arrangement of IRF7 is inverted relative to that of IRF.
piratory syncytial virus (RSV), a leading cause of respiratory tract infections in infants, inhibits type I interferon (IFN)-dependent signalling, as well as IFN synthesis. RSV non-structural protein NS1 plays a significant role in this inhibition; however, the mechanism(s) responsible is not fully known. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 is essential for viral-induced IFN-β synthesis. In this study, we found that NS1 protein inhibits IRF-3-dependent gene transcription in constitutively active IRF-3 overexpressing cells, demonstrating that NS1 directly targets IRF-3. Our data also demonstrate that NS1 associates with IRF-3 and its transcriptional coactivator CBP, leading to disrupted association of IRF-3 to CBP and subsequent reduced binding of IRF-3 to the IFN-β promoter without blocking viral-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and dimerization, thereby identifying a novel molecular mechanism by which RSV inhibits IFN-β synthesi.
cription factor IRF-3 is activated by microbial invasions and produces a variety of cytokines including type-I interferon. Upon microbial infection, IRF-3 is phosphorylated at its C-terminal regulatory domain, then oligomerized, translocated into the nucleus, and here it binds to CBP/p300. Although a number of studies have been reported investigating the activation mechanism of IRF-3, there are a number of unresolved issues, especially on the phosphorylation sites, the oligomerization process and the binding mechanism with CBP/p300. In this report, the phosphorylated IRF-3 regulatory domain (IRF-3 RD) was prepared using the kinase IKK-i, and the active form of phosphorylated IRF-3 RD was identified. The paper also reports the crystal structure of the active form of the phosphorylated IRF-3 RD. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Ser386 was found to be essential for its dimerization and binding with CBP/p300 using mutational analysis and mass spectrometry. Thus, we conclude that the phosphorylation of Ser386 is essential for activation of IRF-.
ial expression of the human interferon A (IFN-A) gene cluster is modulated following paramyxovirus infection by the relative amounts of active interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7. IRF-3 expression activates predominantly IFN-A1 and IFN-B, while IRF-7 expression induces multiple IFN-A genes. IFN-A1 gene expression is dependent on three promoter proximal IRF elements (B, C, and D modules, located at positions -98 to -45 relative to the mRNA start site). IRF-3 binds the C module of IFN-A1, while other IFN-A gene promoters are responsive to the binding of IRF-7 to the B and D modules. Maximal expression of IFN-A1 is observed with complete occupancy of the three modules in the presence of IRF-7. Nucleotide substitutions in the C modules of other IFN-A genes disrupt IRF-3-mediated transcription, whereas a G/A substitution in the D modules enhances IRF7-mediated expression. IRF-3 exerts dual effects on IFN-A gene expression, as follows: a synergistic effect with IRF-7 on IFN-A1 expression and an inhibitory effect on other IFN-A gene promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that transient binding of both IRF-3 and IRF-7, accompanied by CBP/p300 recruitment to the endogenous IFN-A gene promoters, is associated with transcriptional activation, whereas a biphasic recruitment of IRF-3 and CBP/p300 represses IFN-A gene expression. This regulatory mechanism contributes to differential expression of IFN-A genes and may be critical for alpha interferon production in different cell types by RIG-I-dependent signals, leading to innate antiviral immune response.
ed herpesviral kinase, designated ORF36 in murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), plays multiple vital roles in the viral life cycle. Here, we show by screening mutant viruses that ORF36 counteracts the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response. ORF36 specifically binds to the activated form of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) in the nucleus, inhibiting IRF-3 interaction with the cotranscriptional activator CBP and thereby suppressing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the interferon beta promoter. The anti-IFN function of ORF36 is conserved among herpesvirus subfamilies, although the conserved kinase activity is not absolutely required for this function. MHV-68 lacking ORF36 induces a greater interferon response and is attenuated in vitro and in vivo, where acute viral infection in the lung and latency in the spleen are compromised. Our data suggest that herpesviruses have evolved within their conserved kinase an anti-IFN activity critical for evasion of host immunity and for persistenc.
 protein kinase of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the conserved family of herpesvirus protein kinases which, to some extent, have a function similar to that of the cellular cyclin-dependent kinase in regulating multiple cellular and viral substrates. In a yeast two-hybrid screening assay, a splicing variant of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was found to interact with the BGLF4 protein. This interaction was defined further by coimmunoprecipitation in transfected cells and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down in vitro. Using reporter assays, we show that BGLF4 effectively suppresses the activities of the poly(I:C)-stimulated IFN-beta promoter and IRF3-responsive element. Moreover, BGLF4 represses the poly(I:C)-stimulated expression of endogenous IFN-beta mRNA and the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701. In searching for a possible mechanism, BGLF4 was shown not to affect the dimerization, nuclear translocation, or CBP recruitment of IRF3 upon poly(I:C) treatment. Notably, BGLF4 reduces the amount of active IRF3 recruited to the IRF3-responsive element containing the IFN-beta promoter region in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. BGLF4 phosphorylates GST-IRF3 in vitro, but Ser339-Pro340 phosphorylation-dependent, Pin1-mediated downregulation is not responsible for the repression. Most importantly, we found that three proline-dependent phosphorylation sites at Ser123, Ser173, and Thr180, which cluster in a region between the DNA binding and IRF association domains of IRF3, contribute additively to the BGLF4-mediated repression of IRF3(5D) transactivation activity. IRF3 signaling is activated in reactivated EBV-positive NA cells, and the knockdown of BGLF4 further stimulates IRF3-responsive reporter activity. The data presented here thus suggest a novel mechanism by which herpesviral protein kinases suppress host innate immune responses and facilitate virus replicatio.
aB kinase-related kinases, TBK1 and IKKi, were recently shown to be responsible for the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3. However, the identity of the phosphoacceptor site(s) targeted by these two kinases remains unclear. Using a biological assay based on the IRF-3-mediated production of antiviral cytokines, we demonstrate here that all Ser/Thr clusters of IRF-3 are required for its optimal transactivation capacity. In vitro kinase assays using full-length His-IRF-3 as a substrate combined with mass spectrometry analysis revealed that serine 402 and serine 396 are directly targeted by TBK1. Analysis of Ser/Thr-to-Ala mutants revealed that the S396A mutation, located in cluster II, abolished IRF-3 homodimerization, CBP association, and nuclear accumulation. However, production of antiviral cytokines was still present in IRF-3 S396A-expressing cells. Interestingly, mutation of serine 339, which is involved in IRF-3 stability, also abrogated CBP association and dimerization without affecting gene transactivation as long as serine 396 remained available for phosphorylation. Complementation of IRF-3-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts also revealed a compensatory mechanism of serine 339 and serine 396 in the ability of IRF-3 to induce expression of the interferon-stimulated genes ISG56 and ISG54. These data lead us to reconsider the current model of IRF-3 activation. We propose that conventional biochemical assays used to measure IRF-3 activation are not sensitive enough to detect the small fraction of IRF-3 needed to elicit a biological response. Importantly, our study establishes a molecular link between the role of serine 339 in IRF-3 homodimerization, CBP association, and its destabilizatio.
tional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, and NFkappaB. These factors bind cooperatively to the IFN-beta enhancer and recruit coactivators and chromatin-remodeling proteins to the IFN-beta promoter. We describe here a crystal structure of the DNA-binding domains of IRF-3, IRF-7, and NFkappaB, bound to one half of the enhancer, and use a previously described structure of the remaining half to assemble a complete picture of enhanceosome architecture in the vicinity of the DNA. Association of eight proteins with the enhancer creates a continuous surface for recognizing a composite DNA-binding element. Paucity of local protein-protein contacts suggests that cooperative occupancy of the enhancer comes from both binding-induced changes in DNA conformation and interactions with additional components such as CBP. Contacts with virtually every nucleotide pair account for the evolutionary invariance of the enhancer sequenc.
n regulatory factors (IRFs) are essential in the innate immune response and other physiological processes. Activation of these proteins in the cytoplasm is triggered by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in a C-terminal autoinhibitory region, which stimulates dimerization, transport into the nucleus, assembly with the coactivator CBP/p300 and initiation of transcription. The crystal structure of the transactivation domain of pseudophosphorylated human IRF5 strikingly reveals a dimer in which the bulk of intersubunit interactions involve a highly extended C-terminal region. The corresponding region has previously been shown to block CBP/p300 binding to unphosphorylated IRF3. Mutation of key interface residues supports the observed dimer as the physiologically activated state of IRF5 and IRF3. Thus, phosphorylation is likely to activate IRF5 and other family members by triggering conformational rearrangements that switch the C-terminal segment from an autoinihibitory to a dimerization rol.
uced activation of the beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene requires orderly recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes and time-regulated acetylation of histone residues K8H4 and K14H3 on the promoter region. We have previously shown that transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) binds the murine IFN-beta promoter at two sites (-122 and -90) regulating promoter transcriptional capacity with a dual activator/repressor role. In this work we demonstrate that both YY1 -122 and -90 sites are required for CBP recruitment and K8H4/K14H3 acetylation to take place on the IFN-beta promoter region after virus infection. A single point mutation introduced at either one of these two sites inhibiting YY1 binding completely disrupted CBP recruitment and K8H4/K14H3 acetylation independently of HMGI or IRF3 binding to the promoter. We have previously demonstrated that YY1 represses the transcriptional capacity of the IFN-beta promoter through its -90 site via histone deacetylation. Here we demonstrate that, in vivo, the binding of YY1 to the -90 site is constant all through virus infection whereas the binding of YY1 to the -122 site is activated after infection. We discuss here the capacity of YY1 to either repress (through histone deacetylase recruitment) or activate (through CBP recruitment) IFN-beta gene expression according to the occupancy of either only its -90 site or both its -122 and -90 site.
feron-beta promoter has been studied extensively as a model system for combinatorial transcriptional regulation. In virus-infected cells the transcription factors ATF-2, c-Jun, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7 and NF-kappaB, and the coactivators p300/CBP play critical roles in the activation of this and other promoters. It remains unclear, however, why most other combinations of AP-1, IRF and Rel proteins fail to activate the interferon-beta gene. Here we have explored how different IRFs may cooperate with other factors to activate transcription. First we showed in undifferentiated embryonic carcinoma cells that ectopic expression of either IRF-3 or IRF-7, but not IRF-1, was sufficient to allow virus-dependent activation of the interferon-beta promoter. Moreover, the activity of IRF-3 and IRF-7 was strongly affected by promoter context, with IRF-7 preferentially being recruited to the natural interferon-beta promoter. We fully reconstituted activation of this promoter in insect cells. Maximal synergy required IRF-3 and IRF-7 but not IRF-1, and was strongly dependent on the presence of p300/CBP, even when these coactivators only modestly affected the activity of each factor by itself. These results suggest that specificity in activation of the interferon-beta gene depends on a unique promoter context and on the role played by coactivators as architectural factor.
in-12 receptor beta1 (IL12RB1) is expressed on a variety of immune cells, including T and natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, and is involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. Levels of IL12RB1 mRNA are dynamically regulated by various cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-15. To reveal the regulatory mechanisms governing IL12RB1 gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptional regulatory region of the mouse IL12RB1 gene. Promoter analyses in a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, revealed that the 2508-bp region upstream of the transcriptional start site is sufficient for the full transcriptional activation of the IL12RB1 gene by IFN-gamma or IL-15. Analyses of the deletion mutants revealed critical roles of IRE/ISRE and ETS/PU.1 elements, to which IRF3 and PU.1, respectively, bound. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed IL-15 rapidly induced histone H3 acetylation at the IL12RB1 promoter. Consistently, IL-15, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, synergistically enhanced IL12RB1 gene expression and promoter activation by IFN-gamma through increased protein binding to ETS/PU.1 and IRE/ISRE sites. Additionally, IL12RB1 promoter activation by IFN-gamma was enhanced by the coexpression of a coactivator protein, CBP. Thus, IL-15 induces chromatin remodeling of the IL12RB1 gene promoter, increasing IL12RB1 mRNA expression in synergy with IFN-gamma through the recruitment of PU.1 and IRF.
se to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, macrophages activate the transcription of a large number of pro-inflammatory genes by way of signaling pathways downstream of the LPS receptor, Toll-Like Receptor 4. Many of these genes are expressed sequentially in time, with early synthesis events resulting in the secretion of soluble factors that drive the transcription of genes expressed later in the activation cycle. In this study we show that human blood-derived macrophages pretreated with oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) fail to transcribe and secrete interferon beta (IFNbeta) immediately following LPS stimulation. As such, the normal downstream activation of Stat1 is blocked, and numerous IFNbeta/Stat1-activated genes, including the chemokines IP10 and ITAC, are weakly expressed or not expressed at all in these cells. Inspection of the LPS-induced activation state of several transcription factors known to play a prominent role in IFNbeta transcription reveals that, although NFkappaB, c-Jun, and ATF-2 activation appears normal, the LPS-induced activation of IFNbeta regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), as measured by DNA-binding activity and association with the coactivator CBP, is inhibited in the OxLDL pre-treated cells. These IRF3 activities have been shown to be essential for the initiation of transcription of the IFNbeta gene, and the loss of these activities presumably accounts for the lack of LPS-induced IFN beta transcription seen in the OxLDL pre-treated cell.
randed RNA of viral origin and enzymatically synthesized poly I:C act as agonists of TLR3 and induce immune responses. We have designed and synthesized double-stranded synthetic oligoribonucleotides (dsORNs) which act as agonists of TLR3. Each strand of dsORN contains two distinct segments, namely an alignment segment composed of a heteronucleotide sequence and an oligo inosine (I) or an oligo cytidine (C) segment. We report here the results of studies of dsORNs containing varying lengths and compositions of alignment and oligo I/oligo C segments. dsORNs of 50-mer length with a 15-mer alignment segment and a 35-mer oligo I/oligo C segment form stable duplexes under physiological conditions and induce TLR3-mediated immune responses. dsORNs activated the IRF3 signaling pathway in J774 cells, induced production of cytokines, including IFN-β, IFN-α, IP-10, IL-12 and IL-6, in murine and human cell-based assays and also induced multiple cytokines following systemic administration in mice and non-human primate.
describe altered sorting of sortilin in adipocytes deficient for the σ1B-containing AP-1 complex, leading to the inhibition of adipogenesis. The AP-1 complex mediates protein sorting between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. Vertebrates express three AP1 σ1 subunit isoforms - σ1A, σ1B and σ1C (also known as AP1S1, AP1S2 and AP1S3, respectively). σ1B-deficient mice display impaired recycling of synaptic vesicles and lipodystrophy. Here, we show that sortilin is overexpressed in adipose tissue from σ1B(-/-) mice, and that its overexpression in wild-type cells is sufficient to suppress adipogenesis. σ1B-specific binding of sortilin requires the sortilin DxxD-x12-DSxxxL motif. σ1B deficiency does not lead to a block of sortilin transport out of a specific organelle, but the fraction that reaches lysosomes is reduced. Sortilin binds to the receptor DLK1, an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation, and the overexpression of sortilin prevents DLK1 downregulation, leading to enhanced inhibition of adipogenesis. DLK1 and sortilin expression are not increased in the brain tissue of σ1B(-/-) mice, although this is the tissue with the highest expression of σ1B and sortilin. Thus, adipose-tissue-specific and σ1B-dependent routes for the transport of sortilin exist and are involved in the regulation of adipogenesis and adipose-tissue mas.
ental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia) syndrome has been recently described as a new disorder of copper metabolism. This multisystem disease combines clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable using zinc acetate therapy. MEDNIK syndrome is caused by mutation of the AP1S1 gene, which codes for the σ1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1, and directs intracellular trafficking of copper pumps ATP7A and ATP7B. Adaptor protein complexes regulate clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, protein cargo sorting, and vesicular trafficking between organelles in eukaryotic cells. A growing number of diseases have been associated with mutations in genes coding for adaptor protein complexes subunits and we propose for them the term adaptinopathies, as a new organic category of disorders of intracellular trafficking, which offers the opportunity to dissect the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between the Golgi apparatus and the other organelle.
ndrome-acronym for mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, keratodermia-is caused by AP1S1 gene mutations, encoding σ1A, the small subunit of the adaptor protein 1 complex, which plays a crucial role in clathrin coat assembly and mediates trafficking between trans-Golgi network, endosomes and the plasma membrane. MEDNIK syndrome was first reported in a few French-Canadian families sharing common ancestors, presenting a complex neurocutaneous phenotype, but its pathogenesis is not completely understood. A Sephardic-Jewish patient, carrying a new AP1S1 homozygous mutation, showed severe perturbations of copper metabolism with hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia and liver copper accumulation, along with intrahepatic cholestasis. Zinc acetate treatment strikingly improved clinical conditions, as well as liver copper and bile-acid overload. We evaluated copper-related metabolites and liver function retrospectively in the original French-Canadian patient series. Intracellular copper metabolism and subcellular localization and function of copper pump ATP7A were investigated in patient fibroblasts. Copper metabolism perturbation and hepatopathy were confirmed in all patients. Studies in mutant fibroblasts showed abnormal copper incorporation and retention, reduced expression of copper-dependent enzymes cytochrome-c-oxidase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and aberrant intracellular trafficking of Menkes protein ATP7A, which normalized after rescue experiments expressing wild-type AP1S1 gene. We solved the pathogenetic mechanism of MEDNIK syndrome, demonstrating that AP1S1 regulates intracellular copper machinery mediated by copper-pump proteins. This multisystem disease is characterized by a unique picture, combining clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable by zinc acetate therapy, and can now be listed as a copper metabolism defect in humans. Our results may also contribute to understand the mechanism(s) of intracellular trafficking of copper pump.
rotein (AP) complexes regulate clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, protein cargo sorting, and vesicular trafficking between organelles in eukaryotic cells. Because disruption of the various subunits of the AP complexes is embryonic lethal in the majority of cases, characterization of their function in vivo is still lacking. Here, we describe the first mutation in the human AP1S1 gene, encoding the small subunit sigma1A of the AP-1 complex. This founder splice mutation, which leads to a premature stop codon, was found in four families with a unique syndrome characterized by mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, peripheral neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratodermia (MEDNIK). To validate the pathogenic effect of the mutation, we knocked down Ap1s1 expression in zebrafish using selective antisens morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO). The knockdown phenotype consisted of perturbation in skin formation, reduced pigmentation, and severe motility deficits due to impaired neural network development. Both neural and skin defects were rescued by co-injection of AMO with wild-type (WT) human AP1S1 mRNA, but not by co-injecting the truncated form of AP1S1, consistent with a loss-of-function effect of this mutation. Together, these results confirm AP1S1 as the gene responsible for MEDNIK syndrome and demonstrate a critical role of AP1S1 in development of the skin and spinal cor.
adaptor protein (AP) complexes are heterotetramers composed of two large, one medium, and one small subunits. By exploiting the yeast three-hybrid system, we have found that an interaction between the two large subunits of the AP-1 complex, gamma-adaptin and beta1-adaptin, is markedly enhanced in the presence of the small subunit, sigma1. Similarly, two large subunits of the AP-4 complex, epsilon-adaptin and beta4-adaptin, are found to interact with each other only in the presence of the small subunit, sigma4. Furthermore, we have found that an interaction between two large subunits of the COPI F subcomplex, gamma-COP and beta-COP, is detectable only in the presence of zeta-COP. Because these COPI subunits have common ancestral origins to the corresponding AP subunits, these three-hybrid data, taken together with the previous two-hybrid data, suggest that the AP complexes and the COPI F subcomplex assemble by virtue of similar subunit interaction.
dentified a human approximately 87-kDa protein, designated as gamma2-adaptin, that is similar to gamma-adaptin (called gamma1-adaptin in this paper), a large chain of the AP-1 clathrin-associated adaptor complex, not only in the primary structure (60% amino acid identity) but also in the domain organization. Northern blot analysis has shown that its mRNA is expressed in a variety of tissues. Analysis using a yeast two-hybrid system has revealed that, similarly to gamma1-adaptin, gamma2-adaptin is capable of interacting not only with the sigma1 chain (called as sigma1A in this paper), the small chain of the AP-1 complex, but also with a novel sigma1-like protein, designated as sigma1B, which shows an 87% amino acid identity to sigma1A; and that, unlike gamma1-adaptin, it is unable to interact with beta1-adaptin, another large chain of the AP-1 complex. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis has revealed that gamma2-adaptin is localized to paranuclear vesicular structures that are not superimposed on structures containing gamma1-adaptin. Furthermore, unlike gamma1-adaptin, gamma2-adaptin is recruited onto membranes in the presence of a fungal antibiotic, brefeldin A. These data suggest that gamma2-adaptin constitute a novel adaptor-related complex that participates in a transport step different from that of AP-.
dentified two closely related human proteins (sigma3A and sigma3B) that are homologous to the small chains, sigma1 and sigma2, of clathrin-associated adaptor complexes. Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrate that the products of both the sigma3A and sigma3B genes are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell lines. sigma3A and sigma3B are components of a large complex, named AP-3, that also contains proteins of apparent molecular masses of 47, 140 and 160 kDa. In non-neuronal cells, the 47 kDa protein most likely corresponds to the medium chain homolog p47A, and the 140 kDa protein is a homolog of the neuron-specific protein beta-NAP. Like other members of the medium-chain family, the p47A chain is capable of interacting with the tyrosine-based sorting signal YQRL from TGN38. Immunofluorescence microscopy analyses show that the sigma3-containing complex is present both in the area of the TGN and in peripheral structures, some of which contain the transferrin receptor. These results suggest that the sigma3 chains are components of a novel, ubiquitous adaptor-like complex involved in the recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signal.
re highly polarized cells having distinct somatodendritic and axonal domains. Here we report that polarized sorting of the Cu(2+) transporter ATP7B and the vesicle-SNARE VAMP4 to the somatodendritic domain of rat hippocampal neurons is mediated by recognition of dileucine-based signals in the cytosolic domains of the proteins by the σ1 subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP-1. Under basal Cu(2+) conditions, ATP7B was localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane of the soma and dendrites but not the axon. Mutation of a dileucine-based signal in ATP7B or overexpression of a dominant-negative σ1 mutant resulted in nonpolarized distribution of ATP7B between the somatodendritic and axonal domains. Furthermore, addition of high Cu(2+) concentrations, previously shown to reduce ATP7B incorporation into AP-1-containing clathrin-coated vesicles, caused loss of TGN localization and somatodendritic polarity of ATP7B. These findings support the notion of AP-1 as an effector of polarized sorting in neurons and suggest that altered polarity of ATP7B in polarized cell types might contribute to abnormal copper metabolism in the MEDNIK syndrome, a neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in the σ1A subunit isoform of AP-.
 mineral density (BMD) loci were reported in Caucasian genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This study investigated the association between 59 known BMD loci (+200 suggestive SNPs) and DXA-derived BMD in East Asian population with respect to sex and site specificity. We also identified four novel BMD candidate loci from the suggestive SNP.
 have reported BMD-related variations in Caucasian populations. This study investigates whether the BMD loci discovered in Caucasian GWAS are also associated with BMD in East Asian ethnic sample.
f 2,729 unrelated Korean individuals from a population-based cohort were analyzed. We selected 747 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These markers included 547 SNPs from 59 loci with genome-wide significance (GWS, p value less than 5 × 10(-8)) levels and 200 suggestive SNPs that showed weaker BMD association with p value less than 5 × 10(-5). After quality control, 535 GWS SNPs and 182 suggestive SNPs were included in the replication analysi.
5 GWS SNPs, 276 from 25 loci were replicated (p &lt; 0.05) in the Korean population with 51.6 % replication rate. Of the 182 suggestive variants, 16 were replicated (p &lt; 0.05, 8.8 % of replication rate), and five reached a significant combined p value (less than 7.0 × 10(-5), 0.05/717 SNPs, corrected for multiple testing). Two markers (rs11711157, rs3732477) are for the same signal near the gene CPN2 (carboxypeptidase N, polypeptide 2). The other variants, rs6436440 and rs2291296, were located in the genes AP1S3 (adaptor-related protein complex 1, sigma 3 subunit) and RARB (retinoic acid receptor, beta.
ts illustrate ethnic differences in BMD susceptibility genes and underscore the need for further genetic studies in each ethnic group. We were also able to replicate some SNPs with suggestive associations. These SNPs may be BMD-related genetic markers and should be further investigate.
bly of clathrin-coated vesicles is important for numerous cellular processes, including nutrient uptake and membrane organization. Important contributors to clathrin assembly are four tetrameric assembly proteins, also called adaptor proteins (APs), each of which contains a β subunit. We identified a single β subunit, named β1/2, that contributes to both the AP1 and AP2 complexes of Dictyostelium. Disruption of the gene encoding β1/2 resulted in severe defects in growth, cytokinesis and development. Additionally, cells lacking β1/2 displayed profound osmoregulatory defects including the absence of contractile vacuoles and mislocalization of contractile vacuole markers. The phenotypes of β1/2 null cells were most similar to previously described phenotypes of clathrin and AP1 mutants, supporting a particularly important contribution of AP1 to clathrin pathways in Dictyostelium cells. The absence of β1/2 in cells led to significant reductions in the protein amounts of the medium-sized subunits of the AP1 and AP2 complexes, establishing a role for the β subunit in the stability of the medium subunits. Dictyostelium β1/2 could resemble a common ancestor of the more specialized β1 and β2 subunits of the vertebrate AP complexes. Our results support the essential contribution of a single β subunit to the stability and function of AP1 and AP2 in a simple eukaryot.
ompletion rates are significantly higher in males than females in most societies. Although gender differences in suicide rates have been partially explained by environmental and behavioral factors, it is possible that genetic factors, through differential expression between genders, may also help explain gender moderation of suicide risk. This study investigated X-linked genes in suicide completers using a two-step strategy. We first took advantage of the genetic structure of the French-Canadian population and genotyped 722 unrelated French-Canadian male subjects, of whom 333 were suicide completers and 389 were non-suicide controls, using a panel of 37 microsatellite markers spanning the entire X chromosome. Nine haplotype windows and several individual markers were associated with suicide. Significant results aggregated primarily in two regions, one in the long arm and another in the short arm of chromosome X, limited by markers DXS8051 and DXS8102, and DXS1001 and DXS8106, respectively. The second stage of the study investigated differential brain expression of genes mapping to associated regions in Brodmann areas 8/9, 11, 44 and 46, in an independent sample of suicide completers and controls. Six genes within these regions, Rho GTPase-activating protein 6, adaptor-related protein complex 1 sigma 2 subunit, glycoprotein M6B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 90  kDa polypeptide 3, spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase 1 and THO complex 2, were found to be differentially expressed in suicide completer.
are subunits of the heterotetrameric (beta/mu/gamma/sigma) adaptor protein (AP) complexes that are involved in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking. Here, we show that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe the deletion strains of each individual subunit of the AP-1 complex [Apl2 (beta), Apl4 (gamma), Apm1 (mu) and Aps1 (sigma)] caused distinct phenotypes on growth sensitivity to temperature or drugs. We also show that the Deltaapm1 and Deltaapl2 mutants displayed similar but more severe phenotypes than those of Deltaaps1 or Deltaapl4 mutants. Furthermore, the Deltaapl2Deltaaps1 and Deltaapl2Deltaapl4 double mutants displayed synthetic growth defects, whereas the Deltaaps1Deltaapl4 and Deltaapl2Deltaapm1 double mutants did not. In pull-down assay, Apm1 binds Apl2 even in the absence of Aps1 and Apl4, and Apl4 binds Aps1 even in the absence of Apm1 and Apl2. Consistently, the deletion of any subunit generally caused the disassociation of the heterotetrameric complex from endosomes, although some subunits weakly localized to endosomes. In addition, the deletion of individual subunits caused similar endosomal accumulation of v-SNARE synaptobrevin Syb1. Altogether, results suggest that the four subunits are all essential for the heterotetrameric complex formation and for the AP-1 function in exit transport from endosome.
matode Caenorhabditis elegans, there exist two micro1 medium chains of the AP-1 clathrin-associated protein complex. Mutations of unc-101, the gene that encodes one of the micro1 chains, cause pleiotropic effects (). In this report, we identified and analyzed the second mu1 chain gene, apm-1. Unlike the mammalian homologs, the two medium chains are expressed ubiquitously throughout development. RNA interference (RNAi) experiments with apm-1 showed that apm-1 and unc-101 were redundant in embryogenesis and in vulval development. Consistent with this, a hybrid protein containing APM-1, when overexpressed, rescued the phenotype of an unc-101 mutant. However, single disruptions of apm-1 or unc-101 have distinct phenotypes, indicating that the two medium chains may have distinct functions. RNAi of any one of the small or large chains of AP-1 complex (sigma1, beta1, or gamma) showed a phenotype identical to that caused by the simultaneous disruption of unc-101 and apm-1, but not that by single disruption of either gene. This suggests that the two medium chains may share large and small chains in the AP-1 complexes. Thus, apm-1 and unc-101 encode two highly related micro1 chains that share redundant and distinct functions within AP-1 clathrin-associated protein complexes of the same tissu.
and genomic sequences coding for the clathrin coat assembly protein AP17 (sigma2) from maize and its corresponding mRNA accumulation have been analyzed. This protein in yeast and mammals has been shown to be part of the associated protein (AP) complex of clathrin in the plasma membrane. The availability of this sequence as well as a previous AP19 in a plant allows one to propose that specific AP complexes exist in plants in the Golgi complex and in the plasma membrane. The AP17 protein is encoded in maize by a single gene, and its mRNA accumulates in all the organs studied. In the immature embryo, it displays a pattern of expression typical of constitutively expressed gene.
he smallest polypeptide component of AP-1, the clathrin associated protein complex found in clathrin-coated vesicles of the Golgi apparatus. Two genomic clones that encode homologues of AP19 were isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (AAP19-1 and AAP19-2). Analysis of their nucleotide sequences predict proteins of 162 and 163 amino acids with mr of 18,913 and 18,758 respectively. Amino acid sequence comparisons with mammalian, yeast and plant clathrin associated sequences indicates that the Arabidopsis genes encode polypeptides that are more closely related to the AP19 proteins associated with clathrin-coated Golgi vesicles than to AP17, which is part of the AP-2 complex of endocytic clathrin-coated pits. Ribonuclease protection assays showed that both genes are expressed in all Arabidopsis tissues throughout development. Constitutive transcription of AAP19-1 was confirmed in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings and plants containing an AAP19-1 promoter::beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion by ribonuclease protection assays and GUS histochemical stainin.
coated vesicles (CCVs) are involved in selective protein transport in eukaryotes. AP-1 and AP-2 are protein complexes found in the CCVs of the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane respectively. AP19 is the smallest polypeptide chain components of AP-1. We have identified a cDNA clone (CAP19) encoding a putative homologue for the assembly protein AP19 from the Chinese medicinal tree, Camptotheca acuminata. The deduced polypeptide contains 161 amino acids and has a predicted Mr of 18820. DNA blot analysis suggests that the AP19S of C. acuminata are encoded by a small gene family. CAP19 was expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant suggesting that it may be involved in general Golgi-mediated secretio.
itous eps15 protein was initially described as a substrate of the EGF receptor kinase. Its functions are not yet delineated and this work provides evidence for its possible role in endocytosis. A novel anti-eps15 antibody, 6G4, coimmunoprecipitated proteins of molecular mass 102 kD. In human cells, these proteins were identified as the alpha- and beta-adaptins of the AP-2 complex on the basis of their NH2-terminal sequence and their immunoreactivity with anti-alpha- and anti-beta-adaptin antibodies but not with anti-gamma-adaptin antibody. In addition, the anti-eps15 antibody coimmunoprecipitated metabolically labeled polypeptides with molecular mass of 50 and 17 kD, comparable to those of the two other components of the AP-2 complex, mu2 and sigma 2. Constitutive association of eps15 with AP-2 was confirmed by two sets of experiments. First, eps15 was detected in immunoprecipitates of anti-alpha- and anti-beta-adaptin antibodies. Second, alpha- and beta- but not gamma-adaptins were precipitated by a glutathione-S-transferase eps15 fusion protein. The association of eps15 with AP-2 was ubiquitous and conserved between species, since it was observed in human lymphocytes and epithelial cells and in murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Our results are in keeping with a recent study showing homology between the NH2-terminal domains of eps15 and the product of the gene END3, involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the pheromone alpha factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and suggest a possible role for eps15 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammal.
 two clathrin-coated vesicle adaptor complexes in the cell, one associated with the plasma membrane and one associated with the TGN. The subunit composition of the plasma membrane adaptor complex is alpha-adaptin, beta-adaptin, AP50, and AP17; while that of the TGN adaptor complex is gamma-adaptin, beta'-adaptin, AP47, and AP19. To search for adaptor targeting signals, we have constructed chimeras between alpha-adaptin and gamma-adaptin within their NH2-terminal domains. We have identified stretches of sequence in the two proteins between amino acids approximately 130 and 330-350 that are essential for targeting. Immunoprecipitation reveals that this region determines whether a construct coassemblies with AP50 and AP17, or with AP47 and AP19. These observations suggest that these other subunits may play an important role in targeting. In contrast, beta- and beta'-adaptins are clearly not involved in this event. Chimeras between the alpha- and gamma-adaptin COOH-terminal domains reveal the presence of a second targeting signal. We have further investigated the interactions between the adaptor subunits using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions can be detected between the beta/beta'-adaptins and the alpha/gamma-adaptins, between the beta/beta'-adaptins and the AP50/AP47 subunits, between alpha-adaptin and AP17, and between gamma-adaptin and AP19. These results indicate that the adaptor subunits act in concert to target the complex to the appropriate membran.
associated protein (AP) complexes have been implicated in the assembly of clathrin coats and the selectivity of clathrin-mediated protein transport processes. We have identified a yeast gene, APS1, encoding a homolog of the small (referred to herein as sigma) subunits of the mammalian AP-1 complex. Sequence comparisons have shown that Aps1p is more similar to the sigma subunit of the Golgi-localized mammalian AP-1 complex than Aps2p, which is more related to the plasma membrane AP-2 sigma subunit. Like their mammalian counterparts, Aps1p and Aps2p are components of distinct, large (&gt; 200 kDa) complexes and a significant portion of the Aps proteins co-fractionate with clathrin-coated vesicles during gel filtration chromatography. Unexpectedly, even though the evolutionary conservation of AP small subunits is substantial (50% identity between mammalian and yeast proteins), disruptions of APS1 (aps1 delta) and APS2 (aps2 delta), individually or in combination, elicit no detectable mutant phenotypes. These data indicate that the Aps proteins are not absolutely required for clathrin-mediated selective protein transport in cells expressing wild type clathrin. However, aps1 delta accentuated the slow growth and alpha-factor pheromone maturation defect of cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of clathrin heavy chain (Chc) (chc1-ts). In contrast, aps1 delta did not influence the effects of chc1-ts on vacuolar protein sorting or receptor-mediated endocytosis. The aps2 delta mutation resulted in a slight effect on chc1-ts cell growth but had no additional effects. The growth defect of cells completely lacking Chc was compounded by aps1 delta but not aps2 delta. These results comprise evidence that Aps1p is involved in a subset of clathrin functions at the Golgi apparatus. The effect of aps1 delta on cells devoid of clathrin function suggests that Aps1p also participates in clathrin-independent processe.
in AP19 is the smallest polypeptide chain component of AP-1, the clathrin-assembly protein complex located at the Golgi complex. We isolated a gene, termed YAP19, potentially encoding a homolog of AP19 from the genomic DNA of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deduced amino acid sequence, 156 amino acids long, shows 53% identity with the mouse brain AP19 protein, but 37% with Yap17p, a yeast homolog of the mammalian AP17 in AP-2, another clathrin-assembly protein complex located at the plasma membrane. The identification of YAP19 supports the proposal that yeast cells also contain the Golgi-associated clathrin-assembly protein comple.
ntation is a feature of copper deficiency in humans, as caused by mutation of the copper (Cu(2+)) transporter ATP7A in Menkes disease, or an inability to absorb copper after gastric surgery. However, many causes of copper deficiency are unknown, and genetic polymorphisms might underlie sensitivity to suboptimal environmental copper conditions. Here, we combined phenotypic screens in zebrafish for compounds that affect copper metabolism with yeast chemical-genetic profiles to identify pathways that are sensitive to copper depletion. Yeast chemical-genetic interactions revealed that defects in intracellular trafficking pathways cause sensitivity to low-copper conditions; partial knockdown of the analogous Ap3s1 and Ap1s1 trafficking components in zebrafish sensitized developing melanocytes to hypopigmentation in low-copper environmental conditions. Because trafficking pathways are essential for copper loading into cuproproteins, our results suggest that hypomorphic alleles of trafficking components might underlie sensitivity to reduced-copper nutrient conditions. In addition, we used zebrafish-yeast screening to identify a novel target pathway in copper metabolism for the small-molecule MEK kinase inhibitor U0126. The zebrafish-yeast screening method combines the power of zebrafish as a disease model with facile genome-scale identification of chemical-genetic interactions in yeast to enable the discovery and dissection of complex multigenic interactions in disease-gene network.
ughput microarray analysis is an efficient means of obtaining a genome-wide view of transcript profiles across physiological states. However, quantitative PCR (qPCR) remains the chosen method for high-precision mRNA abundance analysis. Essential for reliability of qPCR data is normalization using appropriate internal control genes (ICG), which is now, more than ever before, a fundamental step for accurate gene expression profiling. We mined mammary tissue microarray data on &gt;13,000 genes at -34, -14, 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d relative to parturition in 27 crossbred primiparous gilts to identify suitable ICG. Initial analysis revealed TBK1, PCSK2, PTBP1, API5, VAPB, QTRT1, TRIM41, TMEM24, PPP2R5B, and AP1S1 as the most stable genes (sample/reference = 1 +/- 0.2). We also included 9 genes previously identified as ICG in bovine mammary tissue. Gene network analysis of the 19 genes identified AP1S1, API5, MTG1, VAPB, TRIM41, MRPL39, and RPS15A as having no known co-regulation. In addition, UXT and ACTB were added to this list, and mRNA abundance of these 9 genes was measured by qPCR. Expression of all 9 of these genes was decreased markedly during lactation. In a previous study with bovine mammary tissue, mRNA of stably expressed genes decreased during lactation due to a dilution effect brought about by large increases in expression of highly abundant genes. To verify this effect, highly abundant mammary genes such as CSN1S2, SCD, FABP3, and LTF were evaluated by qPCR. The tested ICG had a negative correlation with these genes, demonstrating a dilution effect in the porcine mammary tissue. Gene stability analysis identified API5, VABP, and MRPL39 as the most stable ICG in porcine mammary tissue and indicated that the use of those 3 genes was most appropriate for calculating a normalization factor. Overall, results underscore the importance of proper validation of internal controls for qPCR and highlight the limitations of using absence of time effects as the criteria for selection of appropriate ICG. Further, we showed that use of the same ICG from one organism might not be suitable for qPCR normalization in other specie.
AP19 are the smallest polypeptide chain components of AP-2 and AP-1, the clathrin-associated protein complexes found in coated structures of the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells. cDNA clones representing the entire coding sequence of AP17 and AP19 were isolated from rat and mouse brain cDNA libraries, respectively. Determination of their nucleotide sequence predicts proteins of 142 and 158 amino acids with Mr 17,018 and 18,733. A sequence comparison of rat brain AP17 with mouse brain AP19 demonstrates that the small chains are highly related. A computer search for other related proteins has uncovered in yeast a previously unknown gene whose DNA sequence encodes a protein homologous to the small chain of AP complexes. The yeast sequence predicts Yap17p, a protein with 147 amino acids and a Mr of 17,373 that is slightly more related to the mammalian AP17 chain than to its AP19 counterpar.
m T helper (Th)-2 cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a major class of IL-4-producing T cells, required for regulation of type 2 humoral immunity; however, transcriptional control of IL-4 production in Tfh cells remains mainly unknown. Here, we show that the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like, Batf is important for IL-4 expression in Tfh cells rather than in canonical Th2 cells. Functionally, Batf in cooperation with interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 4 along with Stat3 and Stat6 trigger IL-4 production in Tfh cells by directly binding to and activation of the CNS2 region in the IL-4 locus. In addition, Batf-to-c-Maf signalling is an important determinant of IL-4 expression in Tfh cells. Batf deficiency impairs the generation of IL-4-producing Tfh cells that results in protection against allergic asthma. Our results thus indicate a positive role of Batf in promoting the generation of pro-allergic IL-4-producing Tfh cell.
out the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF) gene (Batf(-/-)) lack TH17 and follicular helper T cells, which demonstrates that Batf is a transcription factor important for T- and B-cell differentiatio.
tudy we examined whether BATF expression would influence allergic asthm.
rt of preschool control children and children with asthma, we analyzed BATF mRNA expression using real-time PCR in PBMCs. In a murine model of allergic asthma, we analyzed differences in this allergic disease between wild-type, Batf transgenic, and Batf(-/-) mic.
sence of corticosteroid treatment, children with recurrent asthma have a significant increase in BATF mRNA expression in their PBMCs. Batf(-/-) mice display a significant reduction in the pathophysiologic responses seen in asthmatic wild-type littermates. Moreover, we discovered a decrease in IL-3 production and IL-3-dependent mast cell development in Batf(-/-) mice. By contrast, IFN-γ was induced in lung CD4(+) and CD8(+) T&nbsp;cells. Intranasal delivery of anti-IFN-γ antibodies induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in wild-type but not in Batf(-/-) mice. Transgenic overexpression of Batf under the control of the CD2 promoter/enhancer augmented lung inflammation and IgE levels in the setting of experimental asthm.
ncreased in non-steroid-treated asthmatic children. Targeting BATF expression resulted in amelioration of the pathophysiologic responses seen in children with allergic asthma, and BATF has emerged as a novel target for antiasthma intervention.
type and function of liver dendritic cells (LDCs) are poorly understood. This Snapshot summarizes our current knowledge on LDCs in the healthy and injured liver, and their role in fibrosis progression and reversal. It also draws attention to various pitfalls in the current experimental design and conclusions based on available dat.
rk has identified a new subset of CD4(+) T cells named as Tfh cells that are localized in germinal centers and critical in germinal center formation. Tfh cell differentiation is regulated by IL-6 and IL-21, possibly via STAT3 factor, and B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) is specifically expressed in Tfh cells and required for their lineage specification. In the current study, we characterized the role of STAT5 in Tfh cell development. We found that a constitutively active form of STAT5 effectively inhibited Tfh differentiation by suppressing the expression of Tfh-associated factors (CXC motif) receptor 5 (CXCR5), musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-Maf), Bcl6, basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (Batf), and IL-21, and STAT5 deficiency greatly enhanced Tfh gene expression. Importantly, STAT5 regulated the expression of Tfh cell suppressor factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1); STAT5 deficiency impaired Blimp-1 expression and resulted in elevated expression of Tfh-specific genes. Similarly, inhibition of IL-2 potentiated Tfh generation, associated with dampened Blimp-1 expression; Blimp-1 overexpression inhibited Tfh gene expression in Stat5-deficient T cells, suggesting that the IL-2/STAT5 axis functions to regulate Blimp-1 expression. In vivo, deletion of STAT5 in CD4(+) T cells resulted in enhanced development of Tfh cells and germinal center B cells and led to an impairment of B cell tolerance in a well defined mouse tolerance model. Taken together, this study demonstrates that STAT5 controls Tfh differentiatio.
n controls of the carbon acquisition system in marine diatoms in response to environmental factors are an essential issue to understand the changes in marine primary productivity. A pyrenoidal β-carbonic anhydrase, PtCA1, is one of the most important candidates to investigate the control mechanisms of the CO(2) acquisition system in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. A detailed functional assay was carried out on the putative core regulatory region of the ptca1 promoter using a β-glucuronidase reporter in P. tricornutum cells under changing CO(2) conditions. A set of loss-of-function assays led to the identification of three CO(2)-responsive elements, TGACGT, ACGTCA, and TGACGC, at a region -86 to -42 relative to the transcription start site. Treatment with a cyclic (c)AMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP, revealed these three elements to be under the control of cAMP; thus, we designated them, from 5' to 3', as CO(2)-cAMP-Responsive Element1 (CCRE1), CCRE2, and CCRE3. Because the sequence TGACGT is known to be a typical target of human Activating Transcription Factor6 (ATF6), we searched for genes containing a basic zipper (bZIP) region homologous to that of ATF6 in the genome of P. tricornutum. Gel-shift assays using CCRE pentamers as labeled probes showed that at least one candidate of bZIP proteins, PtbZIP11, bound specifically to CCREs. A series of gain-of-function assays with CCREs fused to a minimal promoter strongly suggested that the alternative combination of CCRE1/2 or CCRE2/3 at proper distances from the minimal promoter is required as a potential target of PtbZIP11 for an effective CO(2) response of the ptca1 gen.
cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8(+) T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes--such as BATF--that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HI.
e leukemia virus transactivator, BLV Tax, augments transcription from three imperfect 21-bp repeats in the viral transcriptional regulatory region. Each BLV 21-bp repeat contains a cAMP response element (CRE) in the center and unique 5' and 3' neighboring sequences which are crucial for the transcriptional activation by BLV Tax. Here we describe the interactions of recombinant BLV Tax with cellular bZip proteins. The recombinant BLV Tax, tagged at the carboxy terminus with a hexahistidine extension, was prepared by solubilization in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation on the Ni(2+)-chelating Sepharose gel matrix. The renatured BLV TaxH6 activates the BLV LTR when introduced into HeLa cells by scrape loading. Furthermore, the purified BLV TaxH6 enhances binding of members of the CREB/ATF family of bZip proteins to CRE motifs by interacting with their bZip domains in vitro. Chemical cross-linking indicates that dimerization of bZip proteins such as CREB becomes greatly facilitated in the presence of BLV Tax. These results suggest that BLV Tax interacts directly with CREB/ATF-like factors to activate viral mRNA transcriptio.
 has been postulated to play an important role during feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection; however, its mechanism is not well characterized. This study is focused on apoptosis and transcriptional profiling of FIPV-infected cells following in vitro infection of CRFK cells with FIPV 79-1146 WSU. Flow cytometry was used to determine mode of cell death in first 42&nbsp;h post infection (hpi). FIPV infected cells underwent early apoptosis at 9 hpi (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) followed by late apoptosis at 12 hpi (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) and necrosis from 24 hpi (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Then, next generation sequencing was performed on 9 hpi and control uninfected cells by Illumina analyzer. An aggregate of 4546 genes (2229 down-regulated and 2317 up-regulated) from 17 cellular process, 11 molecular functions and 130 possible biological pathways were affected by FIPV. 131 genes from apoptosis cluster (80 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated) along with increase of apoptosis, p53, p38 MAPK, VEGF and chemokines/cytokines signaling pathways were probably involved in apoptosis process. Six of the de-regulated genes expression (RASSF1, BATF2, MAGEB16, PDCD5, TNFα and TRAF2) and TNFα protein concentration were analyzed by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively, at different time-points. Up-regulations of both pro-apoptotic (i.e. PDCD5) and anti-apoptotic (i.e. TRAF2) were detected from first hpi and continuing to deregulate during apoptosis process in the infected cell.
y members Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 belong to a class of transcription factors containing basic leucine zipper domains that regulate various immunological functions and control the development and differentiation of immune cells. Functional studies by others demonstrated a predominant role for Batf in controlling Th2 cell functions and lineage development of T lymphocytes as well as a critical role of Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 in CD8α+dendritic cell development. Moreover, Batf family member expression was measured in a vast collection of mouse and human cell types by cap analysis gene expression (CAGE), a recent developed sequencing technology, showing reasonable expression spectrum in immune cells consistent with previously published expression profiles. Batf and Batf3 were highly expressed in lymphocytes and the earlier moderately expressed in myeloid lineages. Batf2 was predominantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages. Functional studies in mice demonstrated that Batf2 has a central role in macrophage activation by regulating inflammatory responses during lipopolysaccharides stimulation and mycobacterial infection. Hence, Batf2 could be used as a biomarker and a potential host directed drug target in tuberculosis. Moreover, Batf2 act as a tumor suppressor gene and augmenting Batf2 in malignant cells might be an encouraging therapeutic treatment against cance.
 been found to be decreased in a variety of human malignancies, while its clinical significance and functional roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. Herein, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and to explore the potential functions of BATF2 in ESCC tissues and cell lines. BATF2 mRNA and protein expression levels in human tissues and human ESCC cell lines were evaluated by quantitative real&#8209;time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. BATF2 was upregulated by transfection of the pcDNA3.1&#8209;BATF2 plasmid into KYSE-410 cells. MTT and Transwell assays were used to investigate the effects of BATF2 on cellular proliferation and invasion. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. Cox's proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze univariate and multivariate survival. The results showed that, compared to the matched non-tumor tissues from 36&nbsp;ESCC patients, 80.56% (29/36) of the tumor tissues presented downregulation of BATF2 by WB analysis (P&lt;0.001). The results of IHC in 104&nbsp;patients who underwent surgery for ESCC showed that the expression of BATF2 was closely related to tumor differentiation (P=0.023) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.027), while there was no significant correlation with age (P=0.574), gender (P=0.357), tumor location (P=0.721) and TNM&nbsp;stage (P=0.126) of the patients. Pathological grade (P=0.027), clinical stage (P=0.000), lymph node metastasis (P=0.002) and BATF2 expression (P=0.028) were identified as independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). In the in&nbsp;vitro studies, upregulation of BATF2 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasive ability of the human ESCC KYSE-410 cells. In conclusion, as a tumor suppressor, BATF2 serves as a prognostic biomarker of ESCC and it may be a potential therapeutic target for ESCC treatmen.
cine zipper transcription factor Batf2 is poorly described, whereas Batf and Batf3 have been shown to play essential roles in dendritic cell, T cell, and B cell development and regulation. Batf2 was drastically induced in IFN-γ-activated classical macrophages (M1) compared with unstimulated or IL-4-activated alternative macrophages (M2). Batf2 knockdown experiments from IFN-γ-activated macrophages and subsequent expression profiling demonstrated important roles for regulation of immune responses, inducing inflammatory and host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, and Nos2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Beijing strain HN878)-infected macrophages further induced Batf2 and augmented host-protective Batf2-dependent genes, particularly in M1, whose mechanism was suggested to be mediated through both TLR2 and TLR4 by LPS and heat-killed HN878 (HKTB) stimulation experiments. Irf1 binding motif was enriched in the promoters of Batf2-regulated genes. Coimmunoprecipitation study demonstrated Batf2 association with Irf1. Furthermore, Irf1 knockdown showed downregulation of IFN-γ- or LPS/HKTB-activated host-protective genes Tnf, Ccl5, Il12b, and Nos2. Conclusively, Batf2 is an activation marker gene for M1 involved in gene regulation of IFN-γ-activated classical macrophages, as well as LPS/HKTB-induced macrophage stimulation, possibly by Batf2/Irf1 gene induction. Taken together, these results underline the role of Batf2/Irf1 in inducing inflammatory responses in M. tuberculosis infectio.
igate the expression and clinical significance of BATF2 in the oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC.
n of BATF2 mRNA and protein in 16 paired OTSCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor mucosa were examined using quantitative PCR, western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry assays, and the relation between BATF2 expression and clinical pathologic factor and prognosis was analyze.
red tissues, expression of BATF2 mRNA in 13 OTSCC tissues and expression of BATF2 protein in 14 OTSCC tissues were significantly lower than that in adjacent non-tumor mucosa. In 202 paraffin-embedded OTSCC samples, BATF2 was not expressed in 20 cases (9.9%), low expressed in 104 cases (51.5%) and highly expressed in 78 (38.6%). BATF2 expression level was significantly correlated with histological differentiation (P = 0.002). Patients with low BATF2 expression had significantly poorer overall survival and disease-free survival than those with high BATF2 expression (P &lt; 0.001.
 low expressed in OTSCC and related to tumor differentiation and prognosis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for this diseas.
novel IFN-stimulated gene, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. The objectives of this study were to determine how BATF2 expression is associated with colorectal cancer progression and patient outcome, to investigate how BATF2 overexpression inhibits hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET signaling, and to elucidate the rationale for combining MET inhibitors with IF.
ression in colorectal cancer tissues was determined and correlated with colorectal cancer patient prognosis. Cultured colorectal cancer cells were used to investigate the effects of BATF2 overexpression on the malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer cells and HGF/MET signaling. Tumor xenograft models were used to validate the effects of BATF2 on colorectal cancer xenograft growth and assess the efficacy of the combination of MET inhibitors with IFNs in colorectal cance.
ctal cancer tissues, BATF2 was found to be significantly downregulated, and its expression negatively correlated with MET expression. Decreased BATF2 expression was associated with progression and shorter patient survival in colorectal cancer. BATF2 overexpression promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in colorectal cancer cells, as well as dramatically blunted tumor xenograft growth. In addition, MET inhibitors in combination with IFNβ produced synergistic cytotoxicity both in vitro and in viv.
 these novel findings suggest that BATF2, a tumor suppressor gene, is a potent negative regulator of HGF/MET signaling in colorectal cancer and may serve as a prognostic tumor marker. Furthermore, these results provide a rationale for combining MET inhibitors with IFNs in preclinical trial.
tegration between IFNγ and TLRs in immune cells has been associated with the host defense against pathogens and injury, with a predominant role of STAT1. We hypothesize that STAT1-dependent transcriptional changes in vascular cells involved in cross-talk between IFNγ and TLR4, reflect pro-atherogenic responses in human atherosclerosis. Genome-wide investigation identified a set of STAT1-dependent genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between IFNγ and TLR4 in VSMCs. These included the chemokines Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl8, Ccrl2, Cxcl10 and Ccl5, adhesion molecules Cd40, Cd74, and antiviral and antibacterial genes Rsad2, Mx1, Oasl1, Gbp5, Nos2, Batf2 and Tnfrsf11a. Among the amplified genes was also Irf8, of which Ccl5 was subsequently identified as a new pro-inflammatory target in VSMCs and ECs. Promoter analysis predicted transcriptional cooperation between STAT1, IRF1, IRF8 and NFκB, with the novel role of IRF8 providing an additional layer to the overall complexity. The synergistic interactions between IFNγ and TLR4 also resulted in increased T-cell migration and impaired aortic contractility in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlated with STAT1 phosphorylation in vascular cells in plaques from human carotid arteries. Moreover, using data mining of human plaque transcriptomes, expression of a selection of these STAT1-dependent pro-atherogenic genes was found to be increased in coronary artery disease (CAD) and carotid atherosclerosis. Our study provides evidence to suggest that in ECs and VSMCs STAT1 orchestrates a platform for cross-talk between IFNγ and TLR4, and identifies a STAT1-dependent gene signature that reflects a pro-atherogenic state in human atherosclerosi.
so called SARI, is associated with several cancer types, and loss of BATF2 expression is frequently detected in aggressive and metastatic cancers. The expression of BATF2 was previously shown to slow the growth rate of malignant tumor cells injected into athymic nude mice, and decreased expression of BATF2 has been correlated to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the functional role of BATF2 in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) remains unknown. In the present study, we examined BATF2 expression in 16 fresh, paired OTSCC and adjacent non-tumor tissues, as well as in a normal tongue epithelial cell line and in 5 OTSCC cell lines by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. We also evaluated BATF2 expression in 202 paraffin&#8209;embedded OTSCC and 30 adjacent non-tumor samples by immunohistochemistry, and its relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis was investigated. We found that BATF2 expression was significantly reduced in the majority of the 16 OTSCC tumor tissues and the 5 OTSCC cell lines when compared with the non-tumor tissues and the normal tongue epithelial cell line, respectively. Consistent with these results, our immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that decreased BATF2 expression was present in 124 of the 202 cases and was significantly correlated with poor tumor differentiation (P=0.002). Patients with decreased BATF2 expression showed reduced survival when compared to those with high expression (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that BATF2 expression is an independent predictor of overall survival (P=0.001). These results demonstrate that BATF2 plays a tumor-suppressor role in the development of OTSCC and that BATF2 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for this diseas.
cine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF), BATF2 and BATF3 belong to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors, which regulate numerous cellular processes. Initially, BATF family members were thought to function only as inhibitors of AP-1-driven transcription, but recent studies have uncovered that these factors have unique, non-redundant and positive transcriptional activities in dendritic cells, B cells and T cells. The question of how BATF and BATF3 - which lack a transcriptional activation domain, unlike the AP-1 factors FOS and JUN - can exert unique positive transcriptional specificity has now been answered by the discovery that BATF molecules interact with members of the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) family. The capacity of the BATF leucine zipper regions to mediate dimerization with AP-1 factors and also to define cooperative interactions with heterologous factors explains both the positive transcriptional activity of BATF proteins and how they activate distinct sets of target genes compared with FO.
(suppressor of AP-1, regulated by IFN) gene, which is also called BATF2, is associated with the risk of several kinds of cancer, and loss of SARI expression is frequently detected in aggressive and metastatic cancer. However, the functional role of SARI in lung adenocarcinoma remains unknown. We have shown that loss of SARI expression initiates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is visualized by repression of E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and in clinical lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Using a human lung xenograft-mouse model, we observed that knocking down endogenous SARI in human carcinoma cells leads to the development of multiple lymph node metastases. Moreover, we showed that SARI functions as a critical protein in regulating EMT by modulating the (GSK)-3β-β-catenin signaling pathway. These results demonstrate the mechanism of SARI function in EMT and suggest that assessment of SARI may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma metastasi.
ranscription factor Batf3 is required for homeostatic development of CD8α(+) classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell responses against intracellular pathogens. Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for CD8α(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-γ. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally, physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably, manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of value in augmenting immune responses to vaccine.
xyalkanoate (PHA) synthesis regulatory protein PhaR contains a DNA binding domain (DBD) and a PHA granule binding domain (GBD), it anchors to the promoter region of PHA granule-associated protein (PhaP) to repress phaP expression. However, PhaR will bind to PHB granules and be released from phaP promoter region when PHA granules are formed in vivo, initiating expression of phaP gene. Based on this regulatory mechanism, a bacterial two-hybrid system was developed: PhaR was separated into two parts: DBD was used to fuse with the bait, GBD with the prey, and phaP was replaced by a reporter gene lacZ. However, GBD protein expressed in vivo formed inclusion bodies. Thus, PhaP with strong binding ability to PHB granules was employed to replace GB.
el interaction partners bFos, bJun and bATF2 were used to study the feasibility of this bacterial two-hybrid system compared with the controls lacking one or more essential elements of this system. Results showed that bFos, bJun and bATF2 bound tightly in pairs to allow strong expression of β-galactosidase in different expression levels. In contrast, very weak β-galactosidase activity was detected in all control group.
sidase activity level precisely correlated with the interaction force of tested protein pairs, and very weak β-galactosidase expression was detected throughout the control groups, which demonstrated the feasibility of this system for studying protein interaction.
F2, a basic leucine zipper protein, was recently detected in several normal immortalized cell lines but not in transformed cell lines. In addition, the expression of BATF2 also slowed the growth rate of malignant tumor cells injected into athymic nude mice. In this study, to study the role of BATF2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we examined BATF2 expression in 50 paired HCC tumorous and nontumorous tissues, as well as in five HCC cell lines. Moreover, BATF2 expression in 114 HCC patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis was investigated. We found that BATF2 expression was significantly reduced in most HCC tumorous tissues, when compared with nontumorous tissues, as well as in the five HCC cell lines. Consistent with these results, the immunohistochemistry revealed that decreased BATF2 expression was present in 63 of the 114 cases and was significantly correlated with age (p = 0.006), tumor size (p = 0.046) and tumor differentiation (p = 0.030). Patients with negative BATF2 expression showed a shorter survival than those with positive expression (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis revealed that BATF2 expression was an independent predictor of overall survival (p = 0.015). All the data support the hypothesis that BATF2 plays an important role in the progression of HCC and that it may work as a candidate tumor suppressor and a prognostic marker as well as a potential target for treatmen.
 Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in disease and controls many lysosomal functions. A key in understanding lysosomal Ca(2+) signaling was the discovery of the two-pore channels (TPCs) and their potential activation by NAADP. Recent work concluded that the TPCs function as a PI(3,5)P2 activated channels regulated by mTORC1, but not by NAADP. Here, we identified Mg(2+) and the MAPKs, JNK and P38 as novel regulators of TPC2. Cytoplasmic Mg(2+) specifically inhibited TPC2 outward current, whereas lysosomal Mg(2+) partially inhibited both outward and inward currents in a lysosomal lumen pH-dependent manner. Under controlled Mg(2+), TPC2 is readily activated by NAADP with channel properties identical to those in response to PI(3,5)P2. Moreover, TPC2 is robustly regulated by P38 and JNK. Notably, NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release in intact cells is regulated by Mg(2+), PI(3,5)P2, and P38/JNK kinases, thus paralleling regulation of TPC2 currents. Our data affirm a key role for TPC2 in NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) signaling and link this pathway to Mg(2+) homeostasis and MAP kinases, pointing to roles for lysosomal Ca(2+) in cell growth, inflammation and cance.
cellular signal-regulated protein kinase, ERK2, fully activated by phosphorylation and without a His(6) tag, shows little tendency to dimerize with or without either calcium or magnesium ions when analyzed by light scattering or analytical ultracentrifugation. Light scattering shows that ~90% of ERK2 is monomeric. Sedimentation equilibrium data (obtained at 4.8-11.2 μM ERK2) with or without magnesium (10 mM) are well described by an ideal one-component model with a fitted molar mass of 40180 ± 240 Da (without Mg(2+) ions) or 41290 ± 330 Da (with Mg(2+) ions). These values, close to the sequence-derived mass of 41711 Da, indicate that no significant dimerization of ERK2 occurs in solution. Analysis of sedimentation velocity data for a 15 μM solution of ERK2 with an enhanced van Holde-Weischet method determined the sedimentation coefficient (s) to be ~3.22 S for activated ERK2 with or without 10 mM MgCl(2). The frictional coefficient ratio (f/f(0)) of 1.28 calculated from the sedimentation velocity and equilibrium data is close to that expected for an ~42 kDa globular protein. The translational diffusion coefficient of ~8.3 × 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1) calculated from the experimentally determined molar mass and sedimentation coefficient agrees with the value determined by dynamic light scattering in the absence and presence of calcium or magnesium ions and a value determined by NMR spectrometry. ERK2 has been proposed to homodimerize and bind only to cytoplasmic but not nuclear proteins [Casar, B., et al. (2008) Mol. Cell 31, 708-721]. Our light scattering data show, however, that ERK2 forms a strong 1:1 complex of ~57 kDa with the cytoplasmic scaffold protein PEA-15. Thus, ERK2 binds PEA-15 as a monomer. Our data provide strong evidence that ERK2 is monomeric under physiological conditions. Analysis of the same ERK2 construct with the nonphysiological His(6) tag shows substantial dimerization under the same ionic condition.
1 is a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor potentially useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. A novel six-step synthesis suitable for large-scale preparation was developed in support of a drug development program at Merck Research Laboratories. The key steps include a tandem Heck-lactamization, N-oxidation, and a highly chemoselective Grignard addition of 4-(N-tert-butylpiperidinyl)magnesium chloride to a naphthyridone N-oxide. The N-oxide exerted complete chemoselectivity via chelation in directing the Grignard addition to the alpha position as opposed to 1,4-addition on the ene-lactam. The dihydropyridyl adduct was in situ aromatized with isobutylchloroformate followed by heating in pyridine. Syntheses of Grignard precursor, N-tert-butyl-4-chloro-piperidine, were accomplished via transamination with a quaternary ammonium piperidone or via addition of methylmagnesium chloride to an iminium ion. Utilizing this chemistry, multi-kilogram preparation of compound 1 was successfully demonstrate.
phil adhesion regulates a number of processes involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Neutrophil destructive potential can be modulated by adhesion, allowing alteration of inflammatory cell behaviour while preserving antimicrobial defences. beta(2)-Integrin-mediated neutrophil adhesion to albumin-coated latex beads (ACLB) allows modulation of integrin clustering and ligation and analysis of the effects of adhesion on neutrophil responses. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) enhanced neutrophil binding of different diameter ACLB equally, by almost four-fold, and independently of bead size. Adhesion of neutrophils to ACLB caused a size-dependent generation and release of O(2)(-) and also potentiated TNF alpha-induced O(2)(-) release. 2. Binding of ACLB was not affected by disruption of cytoskeletal integrity with nocodazole or cytochalasin D or following blockade of tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation and an intact cytoskeleton were essential for adhesion- and cytokine-induced O(2)(-) release from neutrophils. Inhibition of adhesion- and cytokine-induced O(2)(-) release by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) indicated that a Src-family tyrosine kinase was the principal regulatory pathway mediating this response in neutrophils, a distal role for p38 MAPK was revealed by use of SB203580. 3. Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Fgr, a Src-family tyrosine kinase, occurred following ACLB adhesion and exposure to TNF alpha, and was susceptible to inhibition by PP2. We suggest that activation of the key regulatory enzyme c-Fgr is achieved following ligation of a critical threshold of integrins following binding of large (&gt;3 microM) ACL.
ular regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) is a eukaryotic protein kinase whose activity is regulated by mitogenic stimuli. To gain insight into the catalytic properties of ERK2 and to complement structure-function studies, we undertook a pre-steady state kinetic analysis of the enzyme. To do this, ERK2 was quantitatively activated by MAPKK1 in vitro by monitoring the stoichiometry and site specificity of phosphorylation using a combination of protein mass spectrometry, tryptic peptide analysis, and (32)P radiolabeling. Using a quench-flow apparatus, MgATP(2-) was rapidly mixed (&lt;1 ms) with both ERK2 and the protein substrate EtsDelta138 in the presence of a saturating total concentration (20 mM) of magnesium ion at 27 degrees C and pH 7.5. An exponential burst of product was observed over the first few milliseconds that followed mixing. This burst had an amplitude alpha of 0.44 and was followed by a slower linear phase. The pre-steady state burst is consistent with two partially rate-limiting enzymatic steps, which have the following rate constants: k(2) = 109 +/- 9 s(-1) and k(3) = 56 +/- 4 s(-1). These are attributed to rapid phosphorylation of EtsDelta138 and the process of product release, respectively. Single-turnover experiments provided an independent determination of k(2) (106 +/- 25 s(-1)). The observed catalytic constant (k(cat)(obs)) was found to be sensitive to the concentration of ERK2. The data fit a model in which ERK2 monomers form dimers and suggest that both the monomeric and dimeric forms of ERK2 are active with catalytic constants (k(cat)) of 25 and 37 s(-1), respectively. In addition, the model suggests that in the presence of saturating concentrations of both magnesium and substrates ERK2 subunits dissociate with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 32 +/- 16 n.
ular regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) is a eukaryotic protein kinase whose activity is regulated by phorbol esters, serum, and growth factors, and displays enhanced activity in several human tumors. Despite its important biological function, its mechanism of catalysis and mode of regulation are poorly understood. Recently, we showed that in the presence of 10 mM magnesium chloride, ERK2 phosphorylates the transcription factor Ets-1 through a random-ordered ternary-complex mechanism [Waas, W. F., and Dalby, K. N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 12532]. Now we provide kinetic evidence that ERK2 must bind two divalent magnesium ions to facilitate catalysis at a physiologically relevant rate, because a second magnesium ion promotes both MgATP2- binding and phosphoryl transfer. The velocity dependence on magnesium at saturating concentrations of the protein substrate, Ets138, over a range of ATP4- and Mg2+ ion concentrations, supports the notion that magnesium is an essential activator of ERK2. At high (&gt; or = 1 mM) concentrations of ATP4-, the velocity dependence on total Mg2+ is sigmoidal, but plateaus at high concentrations of free Mg2+, where the enzyme is fully activated. At concentrations of Mg2+ of &lt; or = 4 mM, the velocity dependence on ATP4- displays a peak when the concentration of ATP4- approaches that of total Mg2+ and tends to zero at high concentrations of ATP4-, where the enzyme is predominantly unactivated. The observed velocity dependencies are consistent with the notion that ERK2*Etsdelta138 complexes and ATP4- compete for the same pool of Mg2+ ions in solution. No binding of ATP4- (0-2.5 mM) by ERK2 (65 microM) can be detected using isothermal titration calorimetry at 27 degrees C, pH 8.0, and an ionic strength of 0.15 M (KCl), suggesting that the complex, MgATP2-, is the true substrate for ERK2. In contrast, 5-iodotubericidin binds ERK2 tightly (K(d) = 1 microM) and displays a competitive inhibition pattern toward MgATP2- and a mixed pattern toward free Mg2+, suggesting that the binding of Mg2+ before MgATP2- is not compulsor.
nt study was designed to investigate the mechanism of action of low extracellular magnesium ion concentration ([Mg(2+)](o)) on isolated canine basilar arteries and single cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells from these arteries. Low-[Mg(2+)](o) medium (0-0.6 mM) produces endothelium-independent contractions in isolated canine basilar arteries in a concentration-dependent manner; the lower the concentration of [Mg(2+)](o), the stronger the contractions. The low-[Mg(2+)](o) medium-induced contractions are significantly attenuated by pretreatment of the arteries with low concentrations of either SB-203580, U-0126, PD-98059, genistein, or an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain inhibitor peptide. IC(50) levels obtained for these five antagonists are consistent with reported inhibitor constant (K(i)) values for these tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) antagonists. Low-[Mg(2+)](o) medium (0-0.6 mM) produces transient intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) peaks followed by a slow, sustained, and elevated plateau of [Ca(2+)](i) in primary single smooth muscle cells from canine basilar arteries. Low-[Mg(2+)](o) medium induces rapid and stable increases in [Ca(2+)](i); these increases are inhibited markedly in the presence of either SB-203580, U-0126, PD-98059, genistein or a SH2 domain inhibitor peptide. Several specific antagonists of known endogenously formed vasoconstrictors do not inhibit or attenuate either the low-[Mg(2+)](o)-induced contractions or the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i). The present study suggests that activation of several cellular signaling pathways, such as protein tyrosine kinases (including the Src family) and MAPK, appears to play important roles in low-[Mg(2+)](o)-induced contractions and the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in smooth muscle cells from canine basilar arterie.
elial tight junction determines the paracellular water and ion movement in the intestine and also prevents uptake of larger molecules, including antigens, in an uncontrolled manner. Claudin-2, one of the 27 mammalian claudins regulating that barrier function, forms a paracellular channel for small cations and water. It is typically expressed in leaky epithelia like proximal nephron and small intestine and provides a major pathway for the paracellular transport of sodium, potassium, and fluid. In intestinal inflammation (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), immune-mediated diseases (celiac disease), and infections (HIV enteropathy), claudin-2 is upregulated in small and large intestine and contributes to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism. In parallel to that upregulation, other epithelial and tight junctional features are altered and the luminal uptake of antigenic macromolecules is enhanced, for which claudin-2 may be partially responsible through induction of tight junction strand discontinuitie.
2+) exchanger-1 (NCX1) is a major calcium extrusion mechanism in renal epithelial cells enabling the efflux of one Ca(2+) ion and the influx of three Na(+) ions. The gradient for this exchange activity is provided by Na,K-ATPase, a hetero-oligomer consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and a regulatory β-subunit (Na,K-β) that also functions as a motility and tumor suppressor. We showed earlier that mice with heart-specific ablation (KO) of Na,K-β had a specific reduction in NCX1 protein and were ouabain-insensitive. Here, we demonstrate that Na,K-β associates with NCX1 and regulates its localization to the cell surface. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with Na,K-β knockdown have reduced NCX1 protein and function accompanied by 2.1-fold increase in free intracellular calcium and a corresponding increase in the rate of cell migration. Increased intracellular calcium up-regulated ERK1/2 via calmodulin-dependent activation of PI3K. Both myosin light chain kinase and Rho-associated kinase acted as mediators of ERK1/2-dependent migration. Restoring NCX1 expression in β-KD cells reduced migration rate and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that NCX1 functions downstream of Na,K-β in regulating cell migration. In parallel, inhibition of NCX1 by KB-R7943 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, LLC-PK1, and human primary renal epithelial cells (HREpiC) increased ERK1/2 activation and cell migration. This increased migration was associated with high myosin light chain phosphorylation by PI3K/ERK-dependent mechanism in HREpiC cells. These data confirm the role of NCX1 activity in regulating renal epithelial cell migratio.
city is a burdensome side effect of platinum-based chemotherapy that prevents administration of the full efficacious dosage and often leads to treatment withdrawal. Peripheral sensory neurotoxicity varies from paresthesia in fingers to ataxic gait, which might be transient or irreversible. Because the number of patients being treated with these neurotoxic agents is still increasing, the need for understanding the pathogenesis of this dramatic side effect is critical. Platinum derivatives, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, harm mainly peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglia neurons, possibly because of progressive DNA-adduct accumulation and inhibition of DNA repair pathways (e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinass), which finally mediate apoptosis. Oxaliplatin, with a completely different pharmacokinetic profile, may also alter calcium-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel kinetics through a calcium ion immobilization by oxalate residue as a calcium chelator and cause acute neurotoxicity. Polymorphisms in several genes, such as voltage-gated sodium channel genes or genes affecting the activity of pivotal metal transporters (e.g., organic cation transporters, organic cation/carnitine transporters, and some metal transporters, such as the copper transporters, and multidrug resistance-associated proteins), can also influence drug neurotoxicity and treatment response. However, most pharmacogenetics studies need to be elucidated by robust evidence. There are supportive reports about the effectiveness of several neuroprotective agents (e.g., vitamin E, glutathione, amifostine, xaliproden, and venlafaxine), but dose adjustment and/or drug withdrawal seem to be the most frequently used methods in the management of platinum-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. To develop alternative options in the treatment of platinum-induced neuropathy, studies on in vitro models and appropriate trials planning should be integrated into the future design of neuroprotective strategies to find the best patient-oriented solutio.
ition to a pathological phenotype such as Barrett's esophagus occurs via induction of resistance upon repeated contact with gastric refluxate in esophagus. This study examined the molecular changes within normal esophageal epithelial cells (EECs) under short-term acid loading and the role of these changes in defensive resistance against acidic cytotoxicity. After primary cultured EECs were exposed to pH 4-acidified medium (AM4), cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) activity were measured. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) MEK/ERK1/2, p38 and JNK; phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) were detected by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence staining. AM4 incubation induced intracellular ROS generation accompanied by increase in NOX activity, which was further increased by Na(+) /H(+) exchange-1 (NHE1)-dependent inhibition but was prevented by inhibition of NOX or mitochondria complex I. AM4 also induced phosphorylation of MEK/ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and all these effects, except for p38 MAPK phosphorylation, were abolished by inhibition of ROS. ROS-dependent PI3K/Akt activation, which mediates NF-κB nuclear translocation, was inhibited by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors and NHE1-specific inhibitor. All inhibitors of NHE, ROS, PTK, PI3K, or NF-κB further decreased AM4-induced cell viability. Acid loading in the presence of NHE1-dependent protection induced ROS generation by activating NOX and mitochondria complex I, which stimulated PTK/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB-dependent survival in EEC. Our data indicate that normal EEC initially respond to acid loading through intrinsic survival activatio.
 haloperidol iodide (F2), a novel compound, has shown palliative effects in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, we investigated the effects of F2 on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE)/Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) signal-transduction pathway involved in H2O2-induced Ca(2+) overload, in order to probe the underlying molecular mechanism by which F2 antagonizes myocardial I/R injury. Acute exposure of rat cardiac myocytes to 100 μM H2O2 increased both NHE and NCX activities, as well as levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK. The H2O2-induced increase in NCX current (I NCX) was nearly completely inhibited by the MEK inhibitor U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[o-aminophenylmercapto] butadiene), but only partly by the NHE inhibitor 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), indicating the I NCX increase was primarily mediated by the MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and partially through activation of NHE. F2 attenuated the H2O2-induced I NCX increase in a concentration-dependent manner. To determine whether pathway inhibition was H2O2-specific, we examined the ability of F2 to inhibit MEK/ERK activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF), and NHE activation by angiotensin II. F2 not only inhibited H2O2-induced and EGF-induced MEK/ERK activation, but also completely blocked both H2O2-induced and angiotensin II-induced increases in NHE activity, suggesting that F2 directly inhibits MEK/ERK and NHE activation. These results show that F2 exerts multiple inhibitions on the signal-transduction pathway involved in H2O2-induced I NCX increase, providing an additional mechanism for F2 alleviating intracellular Ca(2+) overload to protect against myocardial I/R injur.
n R (HuR) regulates stress responses through stabilizing and/or facilitating the translation of target mRNAs. The human TRA2β gene encodes splicing factor transformer 2β (Tra2β) and generates 5 mRNA isoforms (TRA2β1 to -5) through alternative splicing. Exposure of HCT116 colon cancer cells to sodium arsenite stimulated checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2)- and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38(MAPK))-mediated phosphorylation of HuR at positions S88 and T118. This induced an association between HuR and the 39-nucleotide (nt) proximal region of TRA2β exon 2, generating a TRA2β4 mRNA that includes exon 2, which has multiple premature stop codons. HuR knockdown or Chk2/p38(MAPK) double knockdown inhibited the arsenite-stimulated production of TRA2β4 and increased Tra2β protein, facilitating Tra2β-dependent inclusion of exons in target pre-mRNAs. The effects of HuR knockdown or Chk2/p38(MAPK) double knockdown were also confirmed using a TRA2β minigene spanning exons 1 to 4, and the effects disappeared when the 39-nt region was deleted from the minigene. In endogenous HuR knockdown cells, the overexpression of a HuR mutant that could not be phosphorylated (with changes of serine to alanine at position 88 [S88A], S100A, and T118A) blocked the associated TRA2β4 interaction and TRA2β4 generation, while the overexpression of a phosphomimetic HuR (with mutations S88D, S100D, and T118D) restored the TRA2β4-related activities. Our findings revealed the potential role of nuclear HuR in the regulation of alternative splicing programs under oxidative stres.
drug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) is a member of the ABCC subfamily of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters that remove cyclic nucleotides from platelets and uptake ADP into dense granule in platelets. However, whether MRP4 directly involves platelet activation remains unclear. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of MRP4 in platelet activation. Our results revealed that the MRP4 inhibitor MK571 inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation which was partially reversed by the PKA inhibitor H89, but not by the adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor SQ22536 and the guanylyl cyclase (GC) inhibitor ODQ, suggesting that MK571 can prevent collagen-induced aggregation via a route independent of cyclic nucleotide production. In the present study, we found that MK571 inhibited collagen-induced ATP release and calcium mobilization. The phosphorylation of protein kinase C, JNK, and Akt was also inhibited by MK571, and electron spin resonance experiment showed that MK571 significantly reduced hydroxyl radical formation. Moreover, MK571 delayed platelet plug formation in vitro by a PFA-100 device, and delayed thrombus formation in mesenteric venules of mice irradiated by fluorescein sodium. However, previous studies have reported that MK571 also blocks MRP1 and leukotriene D4 (LTD4) receptor. Therefore, whether MK571 inhibits platelet activation through MRP1 or LTD4 receptor needs to be considered and further defined. In conclusion, in addition to blocking the transport of cyclic nucleotides, MRP4 inhibition may prevent thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo. Our findings also support the idea that MRP4 may represent a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of thromboembolic disorder.
damage in the hippocampal formation which is more sensitive to ischemic stimulation and easily injured will cause severe learning and memory impairment. Therefore, inhibiting hippocampal neuron injuries is the main contributor for learning and memory impairment during cerebral ischemia. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a new type of neurotransmitter that regulates the nervous, circulatory and immune systems as well as various adverse factors that can reduce cerebral vascular or brain parenchyma injury. During an ischemic stroke, H2S inhibits hippocampal neuronal damage, reducing learning and memory impairment. However, this molecular mechanism has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, we established four-vessel occlusion model in rats with cerebral ischemia. We found that NaHS (28 mmol/kg, intraperitoneally, for 7 days before ischemia), donor of H2S, significantly shortened the distance and time of loading onto the hidden platform in the positioning navigation process, decreased the latency in the space exploration process when cognitive testing with Morris water maze was performed during ischemic stroke in rats. NaHS also significantly shortened latency and reduced the number of errors in the platform diving experiment. The survival rate of neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and the phosphorylation of Akt in the neurons were increased, the phosphorylation ASK1 and JNK3 were inhibited by NaHS. After an intracerebroventricular injection of LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, 10 μL, 100 nmol in 25% DMSO in PBS), the above effects of NaHS were attenuated. These findings suggest that H2S may improve the survival rate of hippocampal neurons and reduce the impairment of learning and memory by increasing the phosphorylation of Akt, inhibiting the phosphorylation of ASK1 and JNK3 in rats with induced ischemic strok.
sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is an effective hypotensive drug and is often used in pediatric intensive care units and to treat acute heart failure, clinical application of SNP is limited by its cardiotoxicity. NecroX-5 (NX-5) was recently developed and has the capacity to inhibit necrotic cell death. No current literature addresses whether NX-5 suppresses SNP-induced cell death or its mechanism of action. We have investigated the protective role of NX-5 against SNP-induced cell death in cardiomyocyte-like H9c2 cells. SNP treatment induced severe cell death, possibly through phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase (JNK) and activation of the apoptotic signaling pathway, including downregulation of Bcl-2 and cleavage of caspase-3. However, NX-5 suppresses SNP-induced cell death through inhibition of JNK activation and suppression of both downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression and caspase-3 cleavage. These findings will provide insights and facilitate development of antidotes to SNP toxicity in cardiac cell.
s a widespread environmental toxicant in the world and regarded as both a carcinogen and an anticarcinogen. The present study was designed to evaluate roles of mitogen-activated protein kinases in sodium arsenite-induced effects on primary-cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Results revealed a decreased viability of the cells exposed to sodium arsenite (from 0 to 50 μM) in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate assay showed that apoptosis was obviously induced by arsenite treatment. High phosphorylation expressions of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), but not of c-Jun N-terminal kinases were observed due to arsenite treatment by western blotting analysis. Furthermore, SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38) decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells whereas arsenite-stimulated toxicity was enhanced by U0126 (an inhibitor of ERK1/2). Taken together, these data suggest that p38 contributes to arsenite-induced apoptosis of rat CGNs, but ERK1/2 may involve in cell growth and surviva.
neuronal insult events, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, pathological processes of secondary neuronal injury play a key role in the severity of insult and clinical prognosis. Along with nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is regarded as the third gasotransmitter and endogenous neuromodulator and plays multiple roles in the central nervous system under physiological and pathological states, especially in secondary neuronal injury. The endogenous level of H2S in the brain is significantly higher than that in peripheral tissues, and is mainly formed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) in astrocytes and released in response to neuronal excitation. The mechanism of secondary neuronal injury exacerbating the damage caused by the initial insult includes microcirculation failure, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, neuronal apoptosis and calcium overload. H2S dilates cerebral vessels by activating smooth muscle cell plasma membrane ATP-sensitive K channels (KATP channels). This modification occurs on specific cysteine residues of the KATP channel proteins which are S-sulfhydrated. H2S counteracts glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity by inducing astrocytes to intake more glutamate from the extracellular space and thus increasing glutathione in neurons. In addition, H2S protects neurons from secondary neuronal injury by functioning as an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mediator. However, there are still some reports suggest that H2S elevates neuronal Ca(2+) concentration and may contribute to the formation of calcium overload in secondary neuronal injury. H2S also elicits calcium waves in primary cultures of astrocytes and may mediate signals between neurons and glia. Consequently, further exploration of the molecular mechanisms of H2S in secondary neuronal injury will provide important insights into its potential therapeutic uses for the treatment of acute neuronal insult event.
chronic arsenic exposure is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, the molecular mechanism underlying arsenic-induced atherosclerosis remains obscure. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate this molecular mechanism. We examined changes in the mRNA level of the lectin-like oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor (LOX-1) in a mouse aortic endothelial cell line, END-D, after sodium arsenite (SA) treatment. SA treatment significantly upregulated LOX-1 mRNA expression; this finding was also verified at the protein expression level. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analyses showed that the cellular uptake of fluorescence (Dil)-labeled oxLDL was significantly augmented with SA treatment. In addition, an anti-LOX-1 antibody completely abrogated the augmented uptake of Dil-oxLDL. We observed that SA increased the levels of the phosphorylated forms of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (NF-κB)/p65. SA-induced upregulation of LOX-1 protein expression was clearly prevented by treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), or an NF-κB inhibitor, caffeic acid phenethylester (CAPE). Furthermore, SA-augmented uptake of Dil-oxLDL was also prevented by treatment with NAC or CAPE. Taken together, our results indicate that arsenic upregulates LOX-1 expression through the reactive oxygen species-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway, followed by augmented cellular oxLDL uptake, thus highlighting a critical role of the aberrant LOX-1 signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced atherosclerosi.
centrations of the second messenger nitric oxide cause cellular stress leading to cell death. Ras proteins, possible targets of nitric oxide-induced nitrosylation, may act as mediators in nitrosative stress. To analyze the possible involvement of Ras proteins in nitric oxide cytotoxicity, a PC12 rat phaeochromocytoma cell line expressing a dominant negative Ras mutant protein was used in this study. Cytotoxic concentrations of the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside activated several proapoptotic mechanisms, including stimulation of the stress kinase pathways mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, induction and phosphorylation of the p53 protein, and inhibited Akt-mediated antiapoptotic signaling, independent of Ras function. Simultaneously, Ras-dependent stimulation of the prosurvival ERK pathway was also observed, followed by an increased activation of the caspase-9/caspase-3 cascade in cells with impaired Ras function. It is concluded that nitric oxide stimulation of multiple signaling pathways contributes to the cell death program, whereas concomitant activation of the Ras/ERK pathway provides a certain degree of protectio.
gic shock is associated with an inflammatory response consecutive to ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) that leads to cardiovascular failure and organ injury. The role of and the timing of administration of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) remain uncertain. Vascular effects of H2S are mainly mediated through K+ATP-channel activation. Herein, we compared the effects of D,L-propargylglycine (PAG), an inhibitor of H2S production, as well as sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), an H2S donor, on haemodynamics, vascular reactivity and cellular pathways in a rat model of I/R. We also compared the haemodynamic effects of NaHS administered before and 10 minutes after reperfusio.
lly ventilated and instrumented rats were bled during 60 minutes in order to maintain mean arterial pressure at 40 ± 2 mmHg. Ten minutes prior to retransfusion, rats randomly received either an intravenous bolus of NaHS (0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or PAG (50 mg/kg). PNU, a pore-forming receptor inhibitor of K+ATP channels, was used to assess the role of K+ATP channel.
 I/R induced a decrease in mean arterial pressure, lactic acidosis and ex vivo vascular hyporeactivity, which were attenuated by NaHS administered before reperfusion and PNU but not by PAG and NaHS administered 10 minutes after reperfusion. NaHS also prevented aortic inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide production while increasing Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation. NaHS reduced JNK activity and p-P38/P38 activation, suggesting a decrease in endothelial cell activation without variation in ERK phosphorylation. PNU + NaHS increased mean arterial pressure when compared with NaHS or PNU alone, suggesting a dual effect of NaHS on vascular reactivit.
 given before reperfusion protects against the effects of haemorrhage-induced I/R by acting primarily through a decrease in both proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and an upregulation of the Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathwa.
d-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) regulates metabolism, cell proliferation, and inflammation. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with reduced PPARγ expression, and hypoxia exposure regimens that cause PH reduce PPARγ expression. This study examines mechanisms of hypoxia-induced PPARγ downregulation in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia reduced PPARγ mRNA and protein levels, PPARγ activity, and the expression of PPARγ-regulated genes in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) exposed to 1% oxygen for 72 h. Similarly, exposure of mice to hypoxia (10% O₂) for 3 weeks reduced PPARγ mRNA and protein in mouse lung. Inhibiting ERK1/2 with PD98059 or treatment with siRNA directed against either NF-κB p65 or Nox4 attenuated hypoxic reductions in PPARγ expression and activity. Furthermore, degradation of H₂O₂ using PEG-catalase prevented hypoxia-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Nox4 expression, suggesting sustained ERK1/2-mediated signaling and Nox4 expression in this response. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that PPARγ and p65 bind directly to each other in a mutually repressive fashion. We conclude from these results that hypoxic regimens that promote PH pathogenesis and HPASMC proliferation reduce PPARγ expression and activity through ERK1/2-, p65-, and Nox4-dependent pathways. These findings provide novel insights into mechanisms by which pathophysiological stimuli such as hypoxia cause loss of PPARγ activity and pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PH. These results also indicate that restoration of PPARγ activity with pharmacological ligands may provide a novel therapeutic approach in selected forms of P.
 transport inhibitor DIDS is known to reduce aqueous humor secretion but questions remain about anion dependence of the effect. In some tissues, DIDS is reported to cause Na-K-ATPase inhibition. Here, we report on the ability of DIDS to inhibit Na-K-ATPase activity in nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (NPE) and investigate the underlying mechanism. Porcine NPE cells were cultured to confluence on permeable supports, treated with drugs added to both sides of the membrane, and then used for (86)Rb uptake measurements or homogenized to measure Na-K-ATPase activity or to detect protein phosphorylation. DIDS inhibited ouabain-sensitive (86)Rb uptake, activated Src family kinase (SFK), and caused a reduction of Na-K-ATPase activity. PP2, an SFK inhibitor, prevented the DIDS responses. In BCECF-loaded NPE, DIDS was found to reduce cytoplasmic pH (pHi). PP2-sensitive Na-K-ATPase activity inhibition, (86)Rb uptake suppression, and SFK activation were observed when a similar reduction of pHi was imposed by low-pH medium or an ammonium chloride withdrawal maneuver. PP2 and the ERK inhibitor U0126 prevented robust ERK1/2 activation in cells exposed to DIDS or subjected to pHi reduction, but U0126 did not prevent SFK activation or the Na-K-ATPase activity response. The evidence points to an inhibitory influence of DIDS on NPE Na-K-ATPase activity by a mechanism that hinges on SFK activation associated with a reduction of cytoplasmic p.
 subfamily member of AP-1 and has an important role in cellular stress responses. ATF2 has been implicated in a transcriptional response leading to cell migration and malignant tumor progression. However, little is known about the effect of arsenic on expression of ATF2 and regulatory pathways in human urothelial cells. In this study, ATF2 expression was measured in NaAsO(2)-treated human uroepithelial cell line (SV-HUC-1) with 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 μM concentrations in order to provide some basis data for the study on mechanism of bladder cancer induced by arsenic. We found that ATF2 expression levels at 2, 4, 8 and 10 μM arsenic-treated cells were significantly higher than those of control cells, and the strongest expression occurred in 4 μM NaAsO(2)-treated cells. Antioxidants (melatonin) and JNK or p38 inhibitors decreased significantly arsenic-induced ATF2 expression. Taken together, these data indicated that the increasing of ATF2 expression is mediated via oxidative stress induced by arsenic in SV-HUC-1 cells, and JNK or p38 rather than ERK is responsible for arsenic-induced ATF2 expression. ROS were also involved in arsenic induced the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathwa.
ersatile transcriptional repressors that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and appropriate subcellular localization of the Id proteins is important for their functions. We previously identified distinct functional nuclear export signals (NESs) in Id1 and Id2, but no active NES has been reported in Id3. In this study, we found that treatment with the stress-inducing metalloid arsenite led to the accumulation of GFP-tagged Id3 in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic accumulation was impaired by a mutation in the Id3 NES-like sequence resembling the Id1 NES, located at the end of the HLH domain. It was also blocked by co-treatment with the CRM1-specific nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB), but not with the inhibitors for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Importantly, we showed that the closely spaced N-terminal cysteine residues of Id3 interacted with the arsenic derivative phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and were essential for the arsenite-induced cytoplasmic accumulation, suggesting that arsenite induces the CRM1-dependent nuclear export of Id3 via binding to the N-terminal cysteines. Finally, we demonstrated that Id3 significantly repressed arsenite-stimulated transcription of the immediate-early gene Egr-1 and that this repression activity was inversely correlated with the arsenite-induced nuclear export. Our results imply that Id3 may be involved in the biological action of arsenit.
(Tyr) kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases have been thought to participate in the contractile response in various smooth muscles. The aim of the current study was to investigate the involvement of the Tyr kinase pathway in the contraction of bronchial smooth muscl.
arations of bronchi isolated from rats were suspended in an organ bath. Isometric contraction of circular smooth muscle was measured. Immunoblotting was used to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinasess (JNKs) in bronchial smooth muscl.
e the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase(s) in bronchial smooth muscle contraction, the effects of MPAK inhibitors were investigated in this study. The contraction induced by carbachol (CCh) was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with selective Tyr kinase inhibitors (genistein and ST638, n = 6, respectively), and a JNK inhibitor (SP600125, n = 6). The contractions induced by high K depolarization (n = 4), orthovanadate (a potent Tyr phosphatase inhibitor) and sodium fluoride (a G protein activator; NaF) were also significantly inhibited by selective Tyr kinase inhibitors and a JNK inhibitor (n = 4, respectively). However, the contraction induced by calyculin-A was not affected by SP600125. On the other hand, JNKs were phosphorylated by CCh (2.2 ± 0,4 [mean±SEM] fold increase). The JNK phosphorylation induced by CCh was significantly inhibited by SP600125 (n = 4.
dings suggest that the Tyr kinase/JNK pathway may play a role in bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Strategies to inhibit JNK activation may represent a novel therapeutic approach for diseases involving airway obstruction, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas.
f this study was to determine whether thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) mediates the cardioprotective effects of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in a model of ischemic-induced heart failure (HF.
 a cardiac-specific overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Trx1 and wild-type littermates were subjected to ischemic-induced HF. Treatment with H2S as sodium sulfide (Na2S) not only increased the gene and protein expression of Trx1 in the absence of ischemia but also augmented the HF-induced increase in both. Wild-type mice treated with Na2S experienced less left-ventricular dilatation, improved left-ventricular function, and less cardiac hypertrophy after the induction of HF. In contrast, Na2S therapy failed to improve any of these parameters in the dominant negative mutant of Trx1 mice. Studies aimed at evaluating the underlying cardioprotective mechanisms found that Na2S therapy inhibited HF-induced apoptosis signaling kinase-1 signaling and nuclear export of histone deacetylase 4 in a Trx1-dependent manne.
dings provide novel information that the upregulation of Trx1 by Na2S therapy in the setting of HF sets into motion events, such as the inhibition of apoptosis signaling kinase-1 signaling and histone deacetylase 4 nuclear export, which ultimately leads to the attenuationof left-ventricular remodelin.
gical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), recurrence is common, especially in patients presenting with vascular invasion or multifocal disease after curative surgery. Consequently, we examined the expression pattern and prognostic value of miR-19b in samples from these patient.
med a miRNA microarray to detect differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in 5 paired samples of HCC and non-tumoral adjacent liver tissue and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to validate the results in 81 paired samples of HCC and adjacent non-tumoral liver tissues. We examined the associations of miR-19b expression with clinicopathological parameters and survival. MiR-19b was knocked down in Hep3B and an mRNA microarray was performed to detect the affected gene.
he miRNA microarray and real-time PCR, miR-19b was significantly overexpressed in the HCC tumor compared with adjacent non-tumor liver tissues (P &lt; 0.001). The expression of miR-19b was significantly higher in patients who were disease-free 2&nbsp;years after surgery (P &lt; 0.001). High miR-19b expression levels were associated with higher α-fetoprotein levels (P = 0.017). In the log-rank test, high miR-19b was associated with better disease-free survival (median survival 37.107 vs. 11.357; P = 0.022). In Cox multivariate analysis, high miR-19b predicted better disease-free survival and overall survival (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.453, 95&nbsp;% confidence interval [CI] = 0.245-0.845, P = 0.013; HR = 0.318, CI = 0.120-0.846, P = 0.022, respectively). N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) was downregulated, while epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A), high-mobility group protein B2 (HMGB2), and mitogen activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14) were upregulated when miR-19b was knocked down in Hep3.
xpression of miR-19b was significantly correlated with better disease-free and overall survival in patients with HCC presenting with vascular invasion or multifocal disease after curative surgery. MiR-19b may influence the expression of NDRG1, EPCAM, HMGB2, HIF1A, and MAPK1.
roteins are known as regulators of actin-based cellular processes, and some of them are associated with the malignant progression of human cancer. Here, we show that expression of coronin 2A is up-regulated in human colon carcinom.
y included 26 human colon tumour specimens and 9 normal controls. Expression and localisation of coronin 2A was studied by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence imaging, cell fractionation, and immunoblotting. Functional roles of coronin 2A were analysed by over-expression and knock-down of the protein. Protein interactions were studied by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments, mass spectrometry analyses, and in vitro kinase and methylation assay.
ological investigation revealed that the expression of coronin 2A in colon tumour cells is up-regulated during the adenoma-adenocarcinoma progression. At the subcellular level, coronin 2A localised to multiple compartments, i.e. F-actin stress fibres, the front of lamellipodia, focal adhesions, and the nuclei. Over-expression of coronin 2A led to a reduction of F-actin stress fibres and elevated cell migration velocity. We identified two novel direct coronin 2A interaction partners. The interaction of coronin 2A with MAPK14 (mitogen activated protein kinase 14 or MAP kinase p38α) led to phosphorylation of coronin 2A and also to activation of the MAPK14 pathway. Moreover, coronin 2A interacted with PRMT5 (protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5), which modulates the sensitivity of tumour cells to TRAIL-induced cell deat.
hat increased expression of coronin 2A is associated with the malignant phenotype of human colon carcinoma. Moreover, we linked coronin 2A to MAPK14 and PRMT5 signalling pathways involved in tumour progressio.
nisms leading to the cell fate decision between apoptosis and senescence upon DNA damage are still unclear and have stochastic features. Cellular oxidative stress can generate DNA damage and activate the important mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (p38MAPK) that is involved in pathologies like Alzheimer's disease. Based on experimental evidence we propose a simple network that might operate at the core of the cell control machinery for the choice between apoptosis and senescence involving the cross-talk between p38MAPK, the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p16INK4a). We have performed two types of analyses, deterministic and stochastic, exploring the system's parameter space, in the first, we calculated the fixed points of the deterministic model and, in the second, we numerically integrated the master equation for the stochastic version. The model shows a variety of behaviors dependent on the parameters including states of high expression levels of p53 or p16INK4a that can be associated with an apoptotic or senescent phenotype, respectively, in agreement with experimental data. In addition, we observe both monostable and bistable behavior (where bistability is a phenomenon in which two stable steady states coexist for a fixed set of control parameter values) which here we suggest to be involved in the cell fate decision proble.
y, it has to be acknowledged that overexpressed heat shock protein B27 (HSPB27) have been implicated in the etiology of wide range of human cancers. However, the molecular mechanism leading to the disease initiation to progression in liver cancer is still unknown. Present work was undertaken to investigate the differentially expressed HSPB27 in association with those damages that lead to liver cancer development. For the identification of liver cancer biomarker, samples were subjected to comparative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and were further validated by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. After validation, in silico studies were applied to demonstrate the significantly induced phosphorylated and S-nitrosylated signals. The later included the interacting partner of HSPB27, i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinase-3 and 5 (MAPK3 and 5), ubiquitin C (UBC), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14), and tumor protein p53 (TP53), which bestowed with critical capabilities, namely, apoptosis, cell cycling, stress activation, tumor suppression, cell survival, angiogenesis, proliferation, and stress resistance. Taking together, these results shed new light on the potential biomarker HSPB27 that overexpression of HSPB27 did lead to upregulation of their interacting partner that together demonstrate their possible role as a novel tumor progressive agent for the treatment of metastasis in liver cancer. HSPB27 is a promising diagnostic marker for liver cancer although further large-scale studies are required. Also, molecular profiling may help pave the road to the discovery of new therapie.
y investigated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-mediated cardiac protection against apoptosis caused by diabetic lipotoxicity and explored the protective mechanisms involve.
gf21 mRNA expression was examined in a diabetic mouse model using real-time PCR. After pre-incubation of palmitate-treated cardiac H9c2 cells and primary cardiomyocytes with FGF21 for 15 h, apoptosis and Fgf21-induced cell-survival signalling were investigated using small interfering (si)RNA and/or pharmacological inhibitors. We also examined the cardiac apoptotic signalling and structural and functional indices in wild-type and Fgf21-knockout (Fgf21-KO) diabetic mic.
e model of type 1 diabetes, cardiac Fgf21 expression was upregulated about 40-fold at 2 months and 3-1.5-fold at 4 and 6 months after diabetes. FGF21 significantly reduced palmitate-induced cardiac apoptosis. Mechanistically, palmitate downregulated, but FGF21 upregulated, phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (p38 MAPK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibition of each kinase with its inhibitor and/or siRNA revealed that FGF21 prevents palmitate-induced cardiac apoptosis via upregulating the ERK1/2-dependent p38 MAPK-AMPK signalling pathway. In vivo administration of FGF21, but not FGF21 plus ERK1/2 inhibitor, to diabetic or fatty-acid-infused mice significantly prevented cardiac apoptosis and reduced inactivation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and AMPK and prevented cardiac remodelling and dysfunction. The Fgf21-KO mice were more susceptible to diabetes-induced cardiac apoptosis, and this could be prevented by administration of FGF21. Deletion of Fgf21 did not further exacerbate cardiac dysfunctio.
ults demonstrate that FGF21 prevents lipid- or diabetes-induced cardiac apoptosis by activating the ERK1/2-p38 MAPK-AMPK pathway. FGF21 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes-related cardiac damag.
ificity phosphatase (DUSP) 1 dephosphorylates and inactivates members of the MAPK superfamily, in particular, JNKs, p38α, and p38β MAPKs. It functions as an essential negative regulator of innate immune responses, hence disruption of the Dusp1 gene renders mice extremely sensitive to a wide variety of experimental inflammatory challenges. The principal mechanisms behind the overexpression of inflammatory mediators by Dusp1(-/-) cells are not known. In this study, we use a genetic approach to identify an important mechanism of action of DUSP1, involving the modulation of the activity of the mRNA-destabilizing protein tristetraprolin. This mechanism is key to the control of essential early mediators of inflammation, TNF, CXCL1, and CXCL2, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The same mechanism also contributes to the regulation of a large number of transcripts induced by treatment of macrophages with LPS. These findings demonstrate that modulation of the phosphorylation status of tristetraprolin is an important physiological mechanism by which innate immune responses can be controlle.
RIPK1 (receptor [TNFRSF]-interacting protein kinase 1) is emerging as a critical determinant of cell fate in response to cellular stress resulting from activation of death receptors and DNA damage, its potential role in cell response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress remains undefined. Here we report that RIPK1 functions as an important prosurvival mechanism in melanoma cells undergoing pharmacological ER stress induced by tunicamycin (TM) or thapsigargin (TG) through activation of autophagy. While treatment with TM or TG upregulated RIPK1 and triggered autophagy in melanoma cells, knockdown of RIPK1 inhibited autophagy and rendered the cells sensitive to killing by TM or TG, recapitulating the effect of inhibition of autophagy. Consistently, overexpression of RIPK1 enhanced induction of autophagy and conferred resistance of melanoma cells to TM- or TG-induced cell death. Activation of MAPK8/JNK1 or MAPK9/JNK2, which phosphorylated BCL2L11/BIM leading to its dissociation from BECN1/Beclin 1, was involved in TM- or TG-induced, RIPK1-mediated activation of autophagy; whereas, activation of the transcription factor HSF1 (heat shock factor protein 1) downstream of the ERN1/IRE1-XBP1 axis of the unfolded protein response was responsible for the increase in RIPK1 in melanoma cells undergoing pharmacological ER stress. Collectively, these results identify upregulation of RIPK1 as an important resistance mechanism of melanoma cells to TM- or TG-induced ER stress by protecting against cell death through activation of autophagy, and suggest that targeting the autophagy-activating mechanism of RIPK1 may be a useful strategy to enhance sensitivity of melanoma cells to therapeutic agents that induce ER stres.
 are glycan-binding adhesion molecules that mediate the initial steps of leukocyte recognition of endothelium. Cytokines control numerous aspects of CD4 Th cell differentiation, but how cytokines control the induction of ligands for E- and P-selectin on Th cell subsets remains poorly understood. Among 20 cytokines that affect Th cell differentiation, we identified six that induce expression of selectin ligands on murine CD4 T cells above the low levels associated with TCR engagement: IL-12, IL-18, IL-27, IL-9, IL-25, and TGF-β1. Collectively, these six cytokines could potentially account for selectin ligand expression on all of the currently defined nonsessile Th cell lineages, including Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 cells, as well as regulatory T cells. Induction of selectin ligand expression by each of these six cytokines was almost completely inhibited by pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not other MAPKs, or by conditional genetic deletion of p38α MAPK. Analysis of the expression of key glycosyltransferase genes revealed that p38α signaling was selectively required for induction of Fut7 and Gcnt1 but not for the induction of St3gal4 or St3gal6. Constitutively active MKK6, an immediate upstream activator of p38 MAPK, induced selectin ligand expression equivalent to that of cytokines, and this induction was completely dependent on the expression of p38α. Our results identify the repertoire of cytokines responsible for selectin ligand induction on CD4 T cells and provide a mechanistic link between Th cell development and T cell migratio.
nse peptides have recently gained much interest as novel anti-infectives owing to their ability to kill bacteria and simultaneously modulate host cell responses. The cationic host defense peptide GKY25 (GKYGFYTHVFRLKKWIQKVIDQFGE), derived from the C terminus of human thrombin, inhibits proinflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo, but the mode of action is unclear. In this study, we show that GKY25, apart from binding bacterial LPS, also interacts directly with monocytes and macrophages in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Moreover, GKY25 inhibits TLR4- and TLR2-induced NF-κB activation in response to several microbe-derived agonists. Furthermore, GKY25 reduces LPS-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs p38α and JNK1/2/3. FACS and electron microscopy analyses showed that GKY25 interferes with TLR4/myeloid differentiation protein-2 dimerization. The results demonstrate a previously undisclosed activity of the host defense peptide GKY25, based on combined LPS and cell interactions leading to inhibition of TLR4 dimerization and subsequent reduction of NF-κB activity and proinflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and macrophage.
38α plays a critical role in inflammation, it has been an attractive target for the development of anti-inflammation therapeutics. However, p38α inhibitors showed side effects, including severe liver toxicity, that often prevailed over the benefits in clinical studies, and the mechanism of toxicity is not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that p38α regulates the inflammatory responses in acute liver inflammation in a tissue-specific manner, and liver toxicity by p38α inhibitors may be a result of the inhibition of protective activity of p38α in the liver. Genetic ablation of p38α in T and NKT cells protected mice from liver injury in Con A-induced liver inflammation, whereas liver-specific deletion of p38α aggravated liver pathology. We found that p38α deficiency in the liver increased the expression of chemokines to recruit more inflammatory cells, indicating that p38α in the liver plays a protective anti-inflammatory role during acute liver inflammation. Therefore, our results suggest that p38α regulates the inflammatory responses in a tissue-specific manner, and that the tissue-specific p38α targeting strategies can be used for the development of an effective anti-inflammation treatment with an improved side-effect profil.
rginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a key epigenetic regulator that symmetrically dimethylates arginine residues on histones H3 and H4 to silence gene expression. PRMT5 is frequently observed in a complex with the cofactor methylosome protein 50 (MEP50), which is required for PRMT5 activity. PKCδ/p38δ signaling, a key controller of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, increases p21(Cip1) expression to suppress keratinocyte proliferation. We now show that MEP50 enhances keratinocyte proliferation and survival via mechanisms that include silencing of p21(Cip1) expression. This is associated with enhanced PRMT5-MEP50 interaction at the p21(Cip1) promoter and enhanced arginine dimethylation of the promoter-associated histones H3 and H4. It is also associated with a MEP50-dependent reduction in the level of p53, a key controller of p21(Cip1) gene expression. We confirm an important biological role for MEP50 and PRMT5 in regulating keratinocyte proliferation using a stratified epidermal equivalent model that mimics in vivo epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. In this model, PRMT5 or MEP50 knockdown results in reduced keratinocyte proliferation. We further show that PKCδ/p38δ signaling suppresses MEP50 expression, leading to reduced H3/H4 arginine dimethylation at the p21(Cip1) promoter, and that this is associated with enhanced p21(Cip1) expression and reduced cell proliferation. These findings describe an opposing action between PKCδ/p38δ MAPK signaling and PRMT5/MEP50 epigenetic silencing mechanisms in regulating cell proliferatio.
idence suggests that colonic macrophages and microRNAs play important roles in motor activity in the gastrointestinal tract. However, there are almost no data concerning colonic macrophages and microRNAs in slow transit constipatio.
se of this study was to investigate colonic macrophages and microRNA-128 expression in the pathogenesis of slow transit constipation in colon tissue.
kness colonic specimens from patients undergoing surgery for slow transit constipation, due to refractoriness to other therapeutic interventions (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;25), were compared to controls (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;25), and the number of colonic macrophages (as evaluated by specific monoclonal antibodies) was counted. Gene expression analysis of microRNA-128 was performed by microRNA microarray and qRT-PCR. Lastly, bioinformatics analysis, coupled with luciferase reporter assays, was used to investigate the mRNA transcript(s) targeted by microRNA-12.
to controls, 20 of 25 slow transit constipation patients (80&nbsp;%) had significantly higher numbers of macrophages in colonic specimens, coupled with down-regulation of microRNA-128. Linear regression analyses showed a significant negative correlation between macrophage number and microRNA-128 expression level. Among 83 bioinformatically predicated candidates, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (p38α) was validated to be a direct target of microRNA-128 in human intestinal epithelial cell.
y presents evidence for the negative correlation of macrophage number and microRNA-128 expression, in slow transit constipation patients, representing a possible mechanism of impaired gastrointestinal motilit.
e in macrophages, Coxiella burnetii hijacks the activation pathway of macrophages. Recently, we have demonstrated that C. burnetii, via its lipopolysaccharide (LPS), avoids the activation of p38α-MAPK through an antagonistic engagement of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4. We investigated the fine-tuned mechanism leading to the absence of activation of the p38α-MAPK despite TLR-4 engagement. In macrophages challenged with LPS from the avirulent variants of C. burnetii, TLR-4 and TLR-2 co-immunoprecipitated. This association was absent in cells challenged by the LPS of pathogenic C. burnetii. The disruption makes TLRs unable to signal during the recognition of the LPS of pathogenic C. burnetii. The disruption of TLR-2 and TLR-4 was induced by the re-organization of the macrophage cytoskeleton by C. burnetii LPS. Interestingly, blocking the actin cytoskeleton re-organization relieved the disruption of the association TLR-2/TLR-4 by pathogenic C. burnetii and rescued the p38α-MAPK activation by C. burnetii. We elucidated an unexpected mechanism allowing pathogenic C. burnetii to avoid macrophage activation by the disruption of the TLR-2 and TLR-4 associatio.
e (single or double-strand breaks) triggers adapted cellular responses. These responses are elicited through signalling pathways, which activate cell cycle checkpoints and basically lead to three cellular fates: cycle arrest promoting DNA repair, senescence (permanent arrest) or cell death. Cellular senescence is known for having a tumour-suppressive function and its regulation arouses a growing scientific interest. Here, we advance a qualitative model covering DNA damage response pathways, focusing on G1/S checkpoint enforcement, supposedly more sensitive to arrest than G2/M checkpoin.
 a discrete, logical model encompassing ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) pathways activation upon DNA damage, as well as G1/S checkpoint main components. It also includes the stress responsive protein p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 14) known to be involved in the regulation of senescence. The model has four outcomes that convey alternative cell fates: proliferation, (transient) cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. Different levels of DNA damage are considered, defined by distinct combinations of single and double-strand breaks. Each leads to a single stable state denoting the cell fate adopted upon this specific damage. A range of model perturbations corresponding to gene loss-of-function or gain-of-function is compared to experimental mutation.
 towards an integrative model of DNA-damage response pathways to better cover the onset of senescence, our model focuses on G1/S checkpoint enforcement. This model qualitatively agrees with most experimental observations, including experiments involving mutations. Furthermore, it provides some prediction.
ton acts as an endocrine organ that regulates energy metabolism and calcium and phosphorous homeostasis through the secretion of osteocalcin (Oc) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). However, evidence suggests that osteoblasts secrete additional unknown factors that contribute to the endocrine function of bone. To search for these additional factors, we generated mice with a conditional osteoblast-specific deletion of p38α MAPK known to display profound defects in bone homeostasis. Herein, we show that impaired osteoblast function is associated with a strong decrease in body weight and adiposity (P &lt; 0.01). The differences in adiposity were not associated with diminished caloric intake, but rather reflected 20% increased energy expenditure and the up-regulation of uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) (P &lt; 0.05). These alterations in lipid metabolism and energy expenditure were correlated with a decrease in the blood levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) (40% lower) rather than changes in the serum levels of insulin, Oc, or FGF23. Among all Npy-expressing tissues, only bone and primary osteoblasts showed a decline in Npy expression (P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the intraperitoneal administration of recombinant NPY partially restored the WAT weight and adipocyte size of p38α-deficient mice (P &lt; 0.05). Altogether, these results further suggest that, in addition to Oc, other bone-derived signals affect WAT and energy expenditure contributing to the regulation of energy metabolis.
 regulate migration and invasion. However, the mechanisms involved are only partially known. We had previously identified fibulin 3, which plays a role in migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis, as a gene regulated by p38α. We have characterized in detail how p38 MAPK regulates fibulin 3 expression and its role. We describe here for the first time that p38α, p38γ, and p38δ down-regulate fibulin 3 expression. p38α has a stronger effect, and it does so through hypermethylation of CpG sites in the regulatory sequences of the gene. This would be mediated by the DNA methylase, DNMT3A, which is down-regulated in cells lacking p38α, but once re-introduced represses Fibulin 3 expression. p38α through HuR stabilizes dnmt3a mRNA leading to an increase in DNMT3A protein levels. Moreover, by knocking-down fibulin 3, we have found that Fibulin 3 inhibits migration and invasion in MEFs by mechanisms involving p38α/β inhibition. Hence, p38α pro-migratory/invasive effect might be, at least in part, mediated by fibulin 3 down-regulation in MEFs. In contrast, in HCT116 cells, Fibulin 3 promotes migration and invasion through a mechanism dependent on p38α and/or p38β activation. Furthermore, Fibulin 3 promotes in vitro and in vivo tumor growth of HCT116 cells through a mechanism dependent on p38α, which surprisingly acts as a potent inducer of tumor growth. At the same time, p38α limits fibulin 3 expression, which might represent a negative feed-back loo.
sions, &quot;reactive astrocytes&quot; form a prominent cellular response. However, the nature of this astrocyte immune activity is not well understood. In order to study astrocytic immune responses to inflammation and injury, we generated mice with conditional deletion of p38α (MAPK14) in GFAP+ astrocytes. We studied the role of p38α signaling in astrocyte immune activation both in vitro and in vivo, and simultaneously examined the effects of astrocyte activation in CNS inflammation. Our results showed that specific subsets of cytokines (TNFα, IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10) are critically regulated by p38α signaling in astrocytes. In an in vivo CNS inflammation model of intracerebral injection of LPS, we observed markedly attenuated astrogliosis in conditional GFAPcre p38α(-/-) mice. However, GFAPcre p38α(-/-) mice showed marked upregulation of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL2, CXCL10, TNFα, and IL-1β compared to p38αfl/fl cohorts, suggesting that in vivo responses to LPS after GFAPcre p38α deletion are complex and involve interactions between multiple cell types. This finding was supported by a prominent increase in macrophage/microglia and neutrophil recruitment in GFAPcre p38α(-/-) mice compared to p38αfl/fl controls. Together, these studies provide important insights into the critical role of p38α signaling in astrocyte immune activatio.
accharide (LPS)-induced activation of TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) is followed by a subsequent overwhelming inflammatory response, a hallmark of the first phase of sepsis. Therefore, counteracting excessive innate immunity by autophagy is important to contribute to the termination of inflammation. However, the exact molecular details of this interplay are only poorly understood. Here, we show that PELI3/Pellino3 (pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffold protein in TLR4-signaling, is impacted by autophagy in macrophages (MΦ) after LPS stimulation. We noticed an attenuated mRNA expression of proinflammatory Il1b (interleukin 1, β) in Peli3 knockdown murine MΦ in response to LPS treatment. The autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) emerged as a potential PELI3 binding partner in TLR4-signaling. siRNA targeting Sqstm1 and Atg7 (autophagy related 7), pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin as well as blocking the lysosomal vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase by bafilomycin A1 augmented PELI3 protein levels, while inhibition of the proteasome had no effect. Consistently, treatment to induce autophagy by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase)) inhibition or starvation enhanced PELI3 degradation and reduced proinflammatory Il1b expression. PELI3 was found to be ubiquitinated upon LPS stimulation and point mutation of PELI3-lysine residue 316 (Lys316Arg) attenuated Torin2-dependent degradation of PELI3. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PELI3 colocalized with the typical autophagy markers MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β) and LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2). Our observations suggest that autophagy causes PELI3 degradation during TLR4-signaling, thereby impairing the hyperinflammatory phase during sepsi.
stituted imidazoles were designed as dual inhibitors of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 3 and p38α mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. A library of 45 derivatives was prepared and evaluated in a kinase activity assay for their ability to inhibit both kinases, JNK3 and p38α MAP kinase. Dual inhibitors with IC50 values down to the low double-digit nanomolar range at both enzymes were identified. The best balanced dual JNK3/p38α MAP kinase inhibitors are 6m (IC50: JNK3, 18 nM; p38α, 30 nM) and 14d (IC50: JNK3, 26 nM; p38α, 34 nM) featuring both excellent solubility and metabolic stability. They may serve as useful tool compounds for preclinical proof-of-principle studies in order to validate the synergistic role of both kinases in the progression of Huntington's diseas.
 is the current standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its efficacy is modest with low response rates and short response duration. Predictive biomarkers for sorafenib efficacy are necessary. However, efforts to determine biomarkers for sorafenib have led only to potential candidates rather than clinically useful predictors. Studies based on patient cohorts identified the potential of blood levels of angiopoietin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and transforming growth factor-β1 for predicting sorafenib efficacy. Alpha-fetoprotein response, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and treatment-related side effects may serve as early surrogate markers. Novel approaches based on super-responders or experimental mouse models may provide new directions in biomarker research. These studies identified tumor amplification of FGF3/FGF4 or VEGFA and tumor expression of phospho-Mapk14 and phospho-Atf2 as possible predictive markers that await validation. A group effort that considers various prognostic factors and proper collection of tumor tissues before treatment is imperative for the success of future biomarker research in advanced HC.
cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to its development and progression are not yet fully elucidated. Of note, it has been recently shown that conditional stk11 knockout mice develop atypical hyperplasia and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). We recently reported an inverse correlation between the activity of the STK11/AMPK pathway and the MAPK/p38 cascade in HIF1A-dependent malignancies. Furthermore, MAPK/p38 overactivation was detected in benign prostate hyperplasia, PIN and PCa in mice and humans. Here we report that STK11 expression is significantly decreased in PCa compared to normal tissues. Moreover, STK11 protein levels decreased throughout prostate carcinogenesis. To get insight into the role of STK11-MAPK/p38 activity balance in PCa, we treated PCa cell lines and primary biopsies with a well-established MAPK14-MAPK11 inhibitor (SB202190), which has been extensively used in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that inhibition of MAPK/p38 significantly affects PCa cell survival in a STK11-dependent manner. Indeed, we found that pharmacologic inactivation of MAPK/p38 does not affect viability of STK11-proficient PCa cells due to the triggering of the AMPK-dependent autophagic pathway, while it induces apoptosis in STK11-deficient cells irrespective of androgen receptor (AR) status. Of note, AMPK inactivation or autophagy inhibition in STK11-proficient cells sensitize SB202190-treated PCa cells to apoptosis. On the other end, reconstitution of functional STK11 in STK11-deficient PCa cells abrogates apoptosis. Collectively, our data show that STK11 is a key factor involved in the early phases of prostate carcinogenesis, and suggest that it might be used as a predictive marker of therapeutic response to MAPK/p38 inhibitors in PCa patient.
inases are one of the four subgroups of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily which are involved in the innate immunity. The p38 subfamily that includes four members namely p38α (MAPK14), p38β (MAPK11), p38γ (MAPK12) and p38δ (MAPK13), regulates the activation of several transcription factors. In this study, a p38β (OfMAPK11) homolog and a p38α (OfMAPK14) homolog of Oplegnathus fasciatus were identified at genomic level. Results clearly showed that both MAPK11 and MAPK14 are well-conserved at both genomic structural- and amino acid (aa)-levels. Genomic sequences of OfMAPK11 (∼15.6&nbsp;kb) and OfMAPK14 (∼13.4&nbsp;kb) had 12 exons. A comparison of exon-intron structural arrangement of these genes from different vertebrate lineages indicated that all the exon lengths are highly conserved, except their terminal exons. Full-length cDNAs of OfMAPK11 (3957&nbsp;bp) and OfMAPK14 (2504&nbsp;bp) encoded corresponding proteins of 361 aa and 360 aa, respectively. Both OfMAPK proteins harbored a Ser/Thr protein kinases catalytic domain (S_TKc domain) which includes an activation loop with a dual phosphorylation site (TGY motif) and several specific-binding sites for ATP and substrates. Molecular modeling of the activation loop and substrate binding sites of rock bream MAPKs revealed the conservation of crucial residues and their orientation in 3D space. Transcripts of OfMAPKs were ubiquitously detected in eleven tissues examined, however at different levels. The modulation of OfMAPKs' transcription upon pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs: flagellin, lipopolysaccharide and poly I:C) and pathogens (Edwardsiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae and rock bream iridovirus) was investigated. Among the seven examined tissues, the flagellin-challenge upregulated the mRNA level of both OfMAPKs in the head kidney. Meanwhile, modulation of OfMAPK mRNA expression in the liver upon other immune-challenges varied in a time-dependent manner. Collectively, these results suggest that OfMAPKs are true members of p38 subfamily, which might be induced by different immune stimul.
in controls osmotic water transport in the renal collecting duct through regulation of aquaporin-2. We carried out bioinformatic analysis of quantitative proteomic data from the accompanying paper to investigate mechanisms involved. The experiments used SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) in cultured mpkCCD cells to quantify each protein species in each of 5 differential-centrifugation (DC) fractions with or without the vasopressin analog (dDAVP). The mass spectrometry data and parallel western blotting experiments confirmed that dDAVP addition is associated with an increase of aquaporin-2 abundance in the 17,000 Xg pellet and a corresponding decrease in the 200,000 Xg pellet. Remarkably, all subunits of the cytoplasmic ribosome also increased in the 17,000 Xg pellet in response to dDAVP (P&lt;10(-34)) with a concomitant decrease in the 200,000 Xg pellet. Eukaryotic translation initiation complex 3 (eIF-3) subunits underwent parallel changes (P&lt;10(-6)). These findings are consistent with translocation of assembled ribosomes and eIF-3 complexes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum in response to dDAVP. Conversely, there was a systematic decrease in small GTPase abundances in the 17,000 Xg fraction. In contrast, most proteins showed no systematic redistribution among DC fractions including protein kinases. 246 of the 521 protein kinases coded by the mouse genome were identified, but many fewer were found to colocalize with aquaporin-2 among DC fractions. Bayes' Rule was used to integrate the new colocalization data with prior data in order to identify protein kinases most likely to phosphorylate aquaporin-2 at Ser256 (Camk2b&gt;Camk2d&gt;Prkaca) and Ser261 (Mapk1=Mapk3&gt;Mapk14.
e the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer effect of curcumin in human lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSQCC) SK-MES-1 cell.
ility was determined using MTT assay. Ribonucleic acid sequencing was performed to measure expression levels of transcripts in LSQCC cells treated with 15 μmol/L curcumin (treatment groups) or an equal amount of dimethylsulfoxide (control). Cuffdiff software was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in treatment groups, followed by enrichment analysis of DEGs using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for up and downregulated DEGs were constructed by Cytoscape software using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes data to identify hub node.
significantly reduced cell viability in LSQCC cells. In total, 380 DEGs including 154 upregulated and 126 downregulated genes were found in the treatment groups. The upregulated genes were enriched in base excision repair (BER, such as PCNA, POLL, and MUTYH) and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAT-STAT) signaling pathways (such as AKT1 and STAT5A), while the downregulated genes were enriched in nine pathways, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway (such as PTK2, VEGFA, MAPK1, and MAPK14) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (ARRB2, MAPK1, MAPK14, and NFKB1). PCNA and AKT1 were the hub nodes in the PPI network of upregulated genes while MAPK1, MAPK14, VEGFA, and NFKB1 were the hub nodes in the PPI network of downregulated gene.
might exert anti-cancer effects on LSQCC via regulating BER, JAT-STAT, VEGF, and MAPK signaling pathway.
of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in response to DNA damage has previously been studied, but its underlying mechanisms specific to ionizing radiation (IR) have remained to be elucidated. In this study, function of ATM on radiation-induced cell death in lung cancer H1299 cells was analyse.
g cancer cells, H1299, were used, and cell models with ATM(-/-) and MAPK14(-/-) were established by genetic engineering. Radiosensitivity was analysed using colony formation assays. Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were implemented to detect protein expression and interaction. MDC staining and GFP-LC3 relocalization were used to detect autophag.
 as well as phosphorylation of ATM was activated by ionizing radiation. Both the inhibitor of ATM, KU55933 and ATM silencing reduced phosphorylation of ATM and MAPKAPK2 expression. Both ATM(-/-) and MAPK14(-/-) cells displayed hypersensitivity. IR increased autophagy level by more than 129% in DMSO-treated cells, while only by 47% and 27% in KU55933-treated and ATM(-/-) cells respectively. MAPK14 knock-down alone gave rise to the basal autophagy level, but decreased notably after IR. KU55933 and ATM knock-down inhibited IR-induced autophagy by activating mTOR pathways. Both Beclin1-PI3KIII and Beclin1-MAPKAPK2 interactions as were remarkably affected by silencing either ATM or MAPK1.
ted IR-induced autophagy via the MAPK14 pathway, mTOR pathway and Beclin1/PI3KIII complexes. MAPK14 contributed to radiosensitization of H1299 cell.
r-associated pneumonia (VAP) is still an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. This research aimed to investigate the genes related to VAP and potential diagnosis target.
ession profiles data of GSE30385 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, which included 10 samples of patients with VAP and 10 samples of patients without VAP. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two types of patients were identified by limma package and the functions and pathways of DEGs were predicted by Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Next, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs of all genes in the samples were obtained from STRING database. Then we searched genes related to VAP in NCBI, and constructed a PPI network of these genes. Subsequently, the overlapped genes between genes in the PPI network and DEGs were searched, followed by expression patterns analysis. Furthermore, genes in PPI network were subjected to function and pathway enrichment analysis, and transcription factors were screened on the basis of TRANSFAC databas.
f 69 DEGs were screened between two types of patient samples, and 7 genes related to VAP were obtained. The overlapped genes (e.g. LTF, MAPK14) were enriched in MAPK cascade and immune system-related processes. In addition, MAPK14 was enriched in MAPK signaling pathwa.
elated genes (MAPK14 and LTF) might be the crucial genes in the pathogenesis of VAP, and be served as potential diagnostic target.
enia is a common psychiatric disorder with high heritability and complex genetic architecture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several significant loci associated with schizophrenia. However, the explained heritability is still low. Growing evidence has shown schizophrenia is attributable to multiple genes with moderate effects. In-depth mining and integration of GWAS data is urgently expected to uncover disease-related gene combination patterns. Network-based analysis is a promising strategy to better interpret GWAS to identify disease-related network modules. We performed a network-based analysis on three independent schizophrenia GWASs by using a refined analysis framework, which included a more accurate gene P-value calculation, dynamic network module searching algorithm and detailed functional analysis for the obtained modules genes. The result generated 79 modules including 238 genes, which form a highly connected subnetwork with more statistical significance than expected by chance. The result validated several reported disease genes, such as MAD1L1, MCC, SDCCAG8, VAT1L, MAPK14, MYH9 and FXYD6, and also obtained several novel candidate genes and gene-gene interactions. Pathway enrichment analysis of the module genes suggested they were enriched in several neural and immune system related pathways/GO terms, such as neurotrophin signaling pathway, synaptosome, regulation of protein ubiquitination, and antigen processing and presentation. Further crosstalk analysis revealed these pathways/GO terms were cooperated with each other, and identified several important genes, which might play vital roles to connect these functions. Our network-based analysis of schizophrenia GWASs will facilitate the understanding of genetic mechanisms of schizophreni.
fy genes with aberrant promoter methylation for developing novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets against primary colorectal cancer (CRC.
d CRC and adjacent normal tissues were collected from two CRC patients. A Resi: MBD2b protein-sepharose-4B column was used to enrich the methylated DNA fragments. Difference in the average methylation level of each DNA methylation region between the tumor and control samples was determined by log2 fold change (FC) in each patient to screen the differentially methylated DNA regions. Genes with log2FC value ≥4 or ≤-4 were identified to be hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively. Then, the underlying functions of methylated genes were speculated by Gene Ontology database and pathway enrichment analyses. Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction network was built using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database, and the transcription factor binding sites were screened via the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) databas.
2,284 and 1,142 genes were predicted to have aberrant promoter hypermethylation or hypomethylation, respectively. MAP3K5, MAP3K8, MAPK14, and MAPK9 with promoter hypermethylation functioned via MAPK signaling pathway, focal adhesion, or Wnt signaling pathway, whereas MAP2K1, MAPK3, MAPK11, and MAPK7 with promoter hypomethylation functioned via TGF-beta signaling pathway, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and chemokine signaling pathway. CREBBP, PIK3R1, MAPK14, APP, ESR1, MAPK3, and HRAS were the seven hubs in the constructed protein-protein interaction network. RPL22, RPL36, RPLP2, RPS7, and RPS9 were commonly regulated by transcription factors, and YY1 and IRF4 were hypermethylate.
APK3, HRAS, YY1, and IRF4 may be considered as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapy of CR.
on to its established role in inflammation, the stress-activated p38 MAP kinase pathway plays major roles in the regulation of cell cycle, senescence, and autophagy. Robust studies could establish mechanistic links between MAPK11-MAPK14/p38 signaling and macroautophagy converging at ATG9-trafficking and BECN1 phosphorylation. However, several reports seem to monitor MAPK11-MAPK14/p38-dependence of autophagy exclusively by the use of the SB203580/SB202190 class of MAPK14/MAPK11/p38α/β inhibitors. In this &quot;Letter to the editor&quot; we present data to support our claim that these inhibitors interfere with autophagic flux in a MAPK11-MAPK14/p38-independent manner and hence should no longer be used as pharmacological tools in the analysis of MAPK11-MAPK14/p38-dependence of autophagy. We propose a general guideline from Autophagy with regard to this issue to avoid such misinterpretations in the futur.
h-speed scanning atomic force microscopy, we directly observed single-molecular enzymatic elongation of hyaluronan polymer chains at intervals of 10 s on a mica or lipid bilayer surface, on which Pasteurella multocida hyaluronic acid synthase (pmHAS) was immobilized. The reaction was started by the addition of both UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine monomers. The average catalytic elongation rate constant (k(cat)) was found to be 1.8 mer s(-1) from one active enzyme physically adsorbed on a mica surface. When pmHAS was immobilized by inserting its hydrophobic tail part into lipid bilayers, most of the enzymes retained their activity, and the k(cat) values were found to be in the range 1-10 mer s(-1) for 29 enzymes (average was k(cat) = 2-4 mer s(-1)). These k(cat) values were lowest level of k(cat) = 1-100 s(-1) obtained in bulk solution by radioisotope method.
can branching enzyme, core2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT), forms O-glycans containing an N-acetylglucosamine branch connected to N-acetylgalactosamine (core2 O-glycans) on cell-surface glycoproteins. Here, we report that upregulation of C2GnT is closely correlated with progression of bladder tumours and that C2GnT-expressing bladder tumours use a novel strategy to increase their metastatic potential. Our results showed that C2GnT-expressing bladder tumour cells are highly metastatic due to their high ability to evade NK cell immunity and revealed the molecular mechanism of the immune evasion by C2GnT expression. Engagement of an NK-activating receptor, NKG2D, by its tumour-associated ligand, Major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A (MICA), is critical to tumour rejection by NK cells. In C2GnT-expressing bladder tumour cells, poly-N-acetyllactosamine was present on core2 O-glycans on MICA, and galectin-3 bound the NKG2D-binding site of MICA through this poly-N-acetyllactosamine. Galectin-3 reduced the affinity of MICA for NKG2D, thereby severely impairing NK cell activation and silencing the NK cells. This new mode of NK cell silencing promotes immune evasion of C2GnT-expressing bladder tumour cells, resulting in tumour metastasi.
t of microorganisms to surfaces is a prerequisite for colonization and biofilm formation. The hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus was able to attach to a variety of surfaces, such as glass, mica, pyrite, and carbon-coated gold grids. Deletion mutant analysis showed that for initial attachment the presence of flagella and pili is essential. Attached cells produced extracellular polysaccharides containing mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine. Genes possibly involved in the production of the extracellular polysaccharides were identifie.
is a linear polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and deacetylated glucosamine widely used as a wound-healing accelerator in clinical and veterinary medicine. Chitosan enhances the functions of inflammatory cells such as macrophages (Mphi), inducing the production of cytokines as well as the expression of activation markers, Fc receptors and mannose receptor. In this work we studied the effects of chitosan on the arginine metabolic pathways of both resident and inflammatory (proteose-peptone elicited) rat Mphi. Our results show that low molecular weight (LMW) chitosan activated moderately both the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase pathways in resident Mphi. In inflammatory Mphi treated with chitosan instead, the arginase activity was strongly enhanced. Supernatants of chitosan-stimulated Mphi enhanced the proliferation of the rat cell line C6. These findings suggest that the healing activity of chitosan could rely on the enhanced arginase activity observed in a wound-associated inflammatory milie.
ete sequence of the cDNA for the coding region of human mitochondrial translational release factor 1 has been obtained from human EST clones and 5'RACE. This sequence has been analyzed to provide insights into the relationship between release factors from bacteria and from mammalian mitochondria. The complete cDNA for the human mitochondrial ribosome recycling factor has been assembled using EST clones. This factor has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a His-tagged protei.
ecently described two yeast strains that are mutated in the MRF1 gene encoding the mitochondrial release factor mRF-1. Both mutants provoke gene-specific defects in mitochondrial translational termination. In the present study we report the cloning, sequencing, as well as an analysis of residual activities of both mutant mrf1 alleles. Each allele specifies a different single amino acid substitution located one amino acid apart. The amino acid changes do not affect the level or cellular localization of the mutant proteins, since equal amounts of wild type and mutant mRF-1 were detected in the mitochondrial compartment. Over-expression of the mutant alleles in wild type and mrf1 mutant yeast strains produces a phenotype consistent with a reduced affinity of the mutant release factors for the ribosome, indicating that the mutations map in a release factor domain involved in ribosome binding. We also demonstrate that nonsense suppression caused by a mutation in the mitochondrial homolog of the E. coli small ribosomal protein S4 can be reversed by a slight over-expression of the MRF1 gen.
ture of mitochondrial translation is the reduced number of transfer RNAs and reassignment of codons. For human mitochondria, a major unresolved problem is how the set of stop codons are decoded by the release factors mtRF1a and mtRF1. Here we present three-dimensional structural models of human mtRF1a and mtRF1 based on their homology to bacterial RF1 in the codon recognition domain, and the strong conservation between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomal RNA in the decoding region. Sequence changes in the less homologous mtRF1 appear to be correlated with specific features of the mitochondrial rRNA. Extensive computer simulations of the complexes with the ribosomal decoding site show that both mitochondrial factors have similar specificities and that neither reads the putative vertebrate stop codons AGA and AGG. Instead, we present a structural model for a mechanism by which the ICT1 protein causes termination by sensing the presence of these codons in the A-site of stalled ribosome.
 cells have long been considered as intrinsically tolerogenic or unable to elicit immune responses specific for dead cell-associated antigens. However, multiple stimuli can trigger a functionally peculiar type of apoptotic demise that does not go unnoticed by the adaptive arm of the immune system, which we named &quot;immunogenic cell death&quot; (ICD). ICD is preceded or accompanied by the emission of a series of immunostimulatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in a precise spatiotemporal configuration. Several anticancer agents that have been successfully employed in the clinic for decades, including various chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy, can elicit ICD. Moreover, defects in the components that underlie the capacity of the immune system to perceive cell death as immunogenic negatively influence disease outcome among cancer patients treated with ICD inducers. Thus, ICD has profound clinical and therapeutic implications. Unfortunately, the gold-standard approach to detect ICD relies on vaccination experiments involving immunocompetent murine models and syngeneic cancer cells, an approach that is incompatible with large screening campaigns. Here, we outline strategies conceived to detect surrogate markers of ICD in vitro and to screen large chemical libraries for putative ICD inducers, based on a high-content, high-throughput platform that we recently developed. Such a platform allows for the detection of multiple DAMPs, like cell surface-exposed calreticulin, extracellular ATP and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and/or the processes that underlie their emission, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and necrotic plasma membrane permeabilization. We surmise that this technology will facilitate the development of next-generation anticancer regimens, which kill malignant cells and simultaneously convert them into a cancer-specific therapeutic vaccin.
sus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Despite the prominent role of the adaptive immune system, the importance of controlling the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of GVHD has recently been rediscovered. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a crucial damage-associated molecular pattern signal that functions as a potent innate immune mediator in GVHD. In the present study, we investigated treatment of experimental GVHD through HMGB1 blockade using the compound cyclopentylamino carboxymethylthiazolylindole (NecroX)-7. Treated animals significantly attenuated GVHD-related mortality and inhibited severe tissue damage. These protective effects correlated with the decrease in HMGB1 expression and lower levels of reactive oxidative stress. Additionally, NecroX-7 inhibited the HMGB1-induced release of TNF and IL-6, as well as the expression of TLR-4 and receptor for advanced glycation end products. We also observed increased regulatory T cell numbers, which may be associated with regulation of differentiation signals independent of HMGB1. Taken together, these data indicate that NecroX-7 protects mice against lethal GVHD by reciprocal regulation of regulatory T/Th1 cells, attenuating systemic HMGB1 accumulation and inhibiting HMGB1-mediated inflammatory response. Our results indicate the possibility of a new use for a clinical drug that is effective for the treatment of GVH.
nt study addresses the issue of enhanced apoptotic response to AZT following co-treatment with an NF-kB inhibito.
igate this issue, different cell lines were assayed for susceptibility to AZT-mediated apoptosis without or with the addition of the NF-kB inhibitor Bay-11-7085. For further investigation, U937 cells were selected as good-responder cells to the combination treatment with 32 or 128 μM AZT, and 1 μM Bay-11-7085. Inhibition of NF-kB activation by Bay-11-7085 in cells treated with AZT was assayed through Western blot analysis of p65 expression and by EMSA. Involvement of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in mechanisms underlying the improved effect of AZT following Bay-11-7085 co-treatment, was evaluated by assaying the cytochrome c release and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) status using the JC-1 dye. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes in U937 cells after combination treatment was quantitatively evaluated through real-time PC.
that the combined treatment induced high levels of cytochrome c release and of MMP collapse in association with evident changes in the expression of both anti- and pro-apoptotic genes of the Bcl-2 family. Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly suppressed the sensitization of U937 cells to an enhanced apoptotic response to AZT following co-treatment with the NF-kB inhibito.
indings suggest that a combination regimen based on AZT plus an NF-kB inhibitor could represent a new chemotherapeutic tool for retrovirus-related pathologie.
rosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is known to exacerbate ischemic brain injury; however, the mechanism is unknown. Previous studies have evaluated the effects of TNF-α on neurons with long exposures to high doses of TNF-α, which is not pathophysiologically relevant. We characterized the rapid effects of TNF-α on basal respiration, ATP production, and maximal respiration using pathophysiologically relevant, post-stroke concentrations of TNF-α. We observed a reduction in mitochondrial function as early as 1.5 h after exposure to low doses of TNF-α, followed by a decrease in cell viability in HT-22 cells and primary neurons. Subsequently, we used the HT-22 cell line to determine the mechanism by which TNF-α causes a rapid and profound reduction in mitochondrial function. Pre-treating with TNF-R1 antibody, but not TNF-R2 antibody, ameliorated the neurotoxic effects of TNF-α, indicating that TNF-α exerts its neurotoxic effects through TNF-R1. We observed an increase in caspase 8 activity and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential after exposure to TNF-α which resulted in a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. These novel findings indicate for the first time that an acute exposure to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of TNF-α has neurotoxic effects mediated by a rapid impairment of mitochondrial function. This study focuses on the neurotoxic mechanism of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We demonstrate a prompt mitochondrial dysfunction followed by nerve cell loss after exposure to TNF-α. These studies may provide evidence that the immune system can rapidly and adversely affect brain function and that TNF-α signaling may be a target for neuroprotectio.
esearch on Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis requires relevant animal models that mimic the gradual and progressive development of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that characterizes the disease. Polymorphisms in engrailed 1 (En1), a homeobox transcription factor that is crucial for both the development and survival of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, are associated with sporadic PD. This suggests that En1 mutant mice might be a promising candidate PD model. Indeed, a mouse that lacks one En1 allele exhibits decreased mitochondrial complex I activity and progressive midbrain dopamine neuron degeneration in adulthood, both features associated with PD. We aimed to further characterize the disease-like phenotype of these En1(+/-) mice with a focus on early neurodegenerative changes that can be utilized to score efficacy of future disease modifying studies. We observed early terminal defects in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in En1(+/-) mice. Several weeks before a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra could be detected, we found that striatal terminals expressing high levels of dopaminergic neuron markers TH, VMAT2, and DAT were dystrophic and swollen. Using transmission electron microscopy, we identified electron dense bodies consistent with abnormal autophagic vacuoles in these terminal swellings. In line with these findings, we detected an up-regulation of the mTOR pathway, concurrent with a downregulation of the autophagic marker LC3B, in ventral midbrain and nigral dopaminergic neurons of the En1(+/-) mice. This supports the notion that autophagic protein degradation is reduced in the absence of one En1 allele. We imaged the nigrostriatal pathway using the CLARITY technique and observed many fragmented axons in the medial forebrain bundle of the En1(+/-) mice, consistent with axonal maintenance failure. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we found that nigrostriatal terminals in the dorsal striatum were severely deficient in dopamine release and reuptake. Our findings support a progressive retrograde degeneration of En1(+/-) nigrostriatal neurons, akin to what is suggested to occur in PD. We suggest that using the En1(+/-) mice as a model will provide further key insights into PD pathogenesis, and propose that axon terminal integrity and function can be utilized to estimate dopaminergic neuron health and efficacy of experimental PD therapie.
s mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are indispensible for activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, expression of cytokines and the CD95 ligand (CD95L/FasL). Here we show that activation-induced ROS generation is dependent on mitochondrial fission. Inhibition of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) results in reduced ROS levels and transcriptional activity of NF-κB leading to diminished proliferation and CD95L-dependent activation-induced cell death (AICD). Upon stimulation Drp1 is S-nitrosylated, which is required for oxidative signalling, AICD and cytokine production. In conclusion, we describe a novel signalling pathway that links TCR-induced nitric oxide release to mitochondrial fission and oxidative signallin.
tin-1 (Ang1) is a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and has key roles in the development of the vascular system and vascular protection. In a screen to define signalling pathways regulated by Ang1 in endothelial cells we found the RNA-binding protein hnRNP-K to be phosphorylated in response to Ang1. The ligand stimulated both tyrosine phosphorylation of hnRNP-K and recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Src to the RNA-binding protein. In endothelial cells hnRNP-K was found bound to mRNA encoding the mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2). Ang1 stimulation of cells resulted in the release of UCP2 mRNA from hnRNP-K. Using in vitro assays we confirmed direct binding between hnRNP-K and UCP2 mRNA. Furthermore Src induced phosphorylation of purified hnRNP-K and prevented UCP2 mRNA binding. Tyrosine 458 in the RNA-binding protein was found to be required for suppression of UCP2 mRNA binding by Src phosphorylation. In addition to releasing UCP2 mRNA from hnRNP-K, Ang1 induced an increase in UCP2 protein expression in endothelial cells without affecting total UCP2 mRNA levels. Consistent with the known effects of UCP2 to suppress generation of reactive oxygen species, Ang1 limited ROS production in endothelium stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-α. Taken together these data suggest that UCP2 mRNA is present in endothelial cells bound to hnRNP-K, which holds it in a translationally inactive state, and that Ang1 stimulates Src interaction with hnRNP-K, phosphorylation of the RNA-binding protein, release of these transcripts and upregulation of UCP2 protein expression. This study demonstrates a new mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of UCP2 by the vascular protective ligand Ang1. The ability to rapidly upregulate UCP2 protein expression may be important in protecting endothelial cells from excessive generation of potentially damaging reactive oxygen specie.
the results of several studies have underscored the regulatory effect of H1-histamine receptors in cell proliferation of some cancer cell types, its effect in prostate cancers remains unclear. We have therefore studied the effect of terfenadine (an H1-histamine receptor antagonist) in prostate cancer cell lines. Our data demonstrate that terfenadine was effective against PC-3 and DU-145 cells (two prostate cancer cell lines). In contrast, based on the sulforhodamine B assay, loratadine had less potency while fexofenadine and diphenhydramine had little effect. Terfenadine induced the cleavage of Mcl-1 cleavage into a pro-apoptotic 28-kDa fragment and up-regulation of Bak, resulting in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol. The activation of caspase cascades was detected to be linked to terfenadine action. Bak up-regulation was also examined at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and Bak activation was validated based on conformational change to expose the N terminus. Terfenadine also induced an indirect-but not direct-DNA damage response through the cleavage and activation of caspase-2, phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, phosphorylation of RPA32 and acetylation of Histone H3; these processes were highly correlated to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of caspase cascades. In conclusion, terfenadine induced apoptotic signaling cascades against HRPCs in a sequential manner. The exposure of cells to terfenadine caused the up-regulation and activation of Bak and the cleavage of Mcl-1, leading to the loss of ΔΨm and activation of caspase cascades which further resulted in DNA damage response and cell apoptosi.
 reprogramming is an important driver of tumor progression; however, the metabolic regulators of tumor cell motility and metastasis are not understood. Here, we show that tumors maintain energy production under nutrient deprivation through the function of HSP90 chaperones compartmentalized in mitochondria. Using cancer cell lines, we found that mitochondrial HSP90 proteins, including tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP-1), dampen the activation of the nutrient-sensing AMPK and its substrate UNC-51-like kinase (ULK1), preserve cytoskeletal dynamics, and release the cell motility effector focal adhesion kinase (FAK) from inhibition by the autophagy initiator FIP200. In turn, this results in enhanced tumor cell invasion in low nutrients and metastatic dissemination to bone or liver in disease models in mice. Moreover, we found that phosphorylated ULK1 levels were correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial HSP90 chaperones, including TRAP-1, overcome metabolic stress and promote tumor cell metastasis by limiting the activation of the nutrient sensor AMPK and preventing autophag.
nd cigarette smoke is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although a tie between smoking and cardiovascular disease is well established, the underlying mechanisms still remains elusive due to the lack of adequate animal models. This study was designed to use a mouse model of exposure to cigarette smoke, a surrogate of environmental tobacco smoke, to evaluate the impact of cardiac overexpression of heavy metal scavenger metallothionein on myocardial geometry, contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) properties and apoptosis following side-stream smoke exposur.
e wild-type FVB and metallothionein transgenic mice were placed in a chamber exposed to cigarette smoke for 1 hour daily for 40 days. Echocardiographic, cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) properties, fibrosis, apoptosis and mitochondrial damage were examine.
revealed that smoke exposure enlarged ventricular end systolic and diastolic diameters, reduced myocardial and cardiomyocyte contractile function, disrupted intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, facilitated fibrosis, apoptosis and mitochondrial damage (cytochrome C release and aconitase activity), the effects of which were attenuated or mitigated by metallothionein. In addition, side-stream smoke expose enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β without affecting pan protein expression in the heart, the effect of which was abolished or ameliorated by metallothionein. Cigarette smoke extract interrupted cardiomyocyte contractile function and intracellular Ca(2+) properties, the effect of which was mitigated by wortmannin and NA.
a suggest that side-stream smoke exposure led to myocardial dysfunction, intracellular Ca(2+) mishandling, apoptosis, fibrosis and mitochondrial damage, indicating the therapeutic potential of antioxidant against in second smoking-induced cardiac defects possibly via mitochondrial damage and apoptosi.
α-Trihydroxycholest-5-en-22-one 16-O-(2-O-4-methoxybenzoyl-β-D-xylopyranosyl)-(1→3)-2-O-acetyl-α-L-arabinopyranoside (OSW-1) is a natural product with potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer cells, but the exact mechanisms of action remain to be defined. In this study, we showed that OSW-1 effectively killed leukemia cells at subnanomolar concentrations through a unique mechanism by causing a time-dependent elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) prior to induction of apoptosis. A mechanistic study revealed that this compound inhibited the sodium-calcium exchanger 1 on the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) and a decrease in cytosolic Na(+). The elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) caused mitochondrial calcium overload and resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, OSW-1 also caused a Ca(2+)-dependent cleavage of the survival factor GRP78. Inhibition of Ca(2+) entry into the mitochondria by the uniporter inhibitor RU360 or by cyclosporin A significantly prevented the OSW-1-induced cell death, indicating the important role of mitochondria in mediating the cytotoxic activity. The extremely potent activity of OSW-1 against leukemia cells and its unique mechanism of action suggest that this compound may be potentially useful in the treatment of leukemi.
nsic apoptosis pathway is conserved from worms to humans and plays a critical role in the normal development and homeostatic control of adult tissues. As a result, numerous diseases from cancer to neurodegeneration are associated with either too little or too much apoptosi.
mphoma-2 (BCL-2) family members regulate cell death, primarily via their effects on mitochondria. In stressed cells, proapoptotic BCL-2 family members promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and cytochrome c (cyt c) release into the cytoplasm, where it stimulates formation of the &quot;apoptosome.&quot; This large, multimeric complex is composed of the adapter protein, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1, and the cysteine protease, caspase-9. Recent studies suggest that proteins involved in the processes leading up to (and including) formation of the apoptosome are subject to various forms of post-translational modification, including proteolysis, phosphorylation, and in some cases, direct oxidative modificatio.
ntense investigation of the intrinsic pathway, significant questions remain regarding how cyt c is released from mitochondria, how the apoptosome is formed and regulated, and how caspase-9 is activated within the comple.
tudies on the biochemistry of MOMP and apoptosome formation are needed to understand the mechanisms that underpin these critical processes, and novel animal models will be necessary in the future to ascertain the importance of the many posttranslational modifications reported for BCL-2 family members and components of the apoptosom.
 smoking can contribute to the development of many human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thousands of compounds are present in cigarette smoke, including a large number of reactive oxygen species that can cause DNA damage, leading to the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes. The PAR polymer is degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Here we have investigated the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on A549 human lung epithelial cells. CSE induced DNA damage (comet assay), PAR accumulation (immunofluorescence and immunoblotting), impaired proliferation (clonogenic survival assay and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing measurement), and cell death (MTT reduction, propidium iodide uptake, lactate dehydrogenase release). CSE-induced cell death was also characterized by mitochondrial depolarization but massive translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor could not be observed. To investigate the role of PARylation in CSE-induced oxidative stress, PARP-1- and PARG-silenced A549 cells were used. Silencing of both PARP-1 and PARG sensitized cells to CSE-induced toxicity: PARP-1- and PARG-silenced cell lines exhibited reduced clonogenic survival, displayed a delayed repair of DNA breaks, and showed higher levels of cytotoxicity. CSE triggered the production of mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Addition of superoxide dismutase increased, whereas catalase abolished, CSE-induced PAR formation. In summary, our data show that the superoxide-hydrogen peroxide-DNA breakage pathway activates the PAR cycle by PARP-1 and PARG, which serves as a survival mechanism in CSE-exposed cells. Our data also raise the possibility that the PARP-1/PARG status of smokers may be an important determinant of the efficiency of DNA repair in their lungs and of their susceptibility to CS-induced carcinogenesi.
oid dendritic cells (pDC) are potent APCs known to regulate immune responses to self-Ags, particularly DNA. The mitochondrial fraction of necrotic cells was found to most potently promote human pDC activation, as reflected by type I IFN release, which was dependent upon the presence of mitochondrial DNA and involved TLR9 and receptors for advanced glycation end products. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a highly abundant mitochondrial protein that is functionally and structurally homologous to high mobility group box protein 1, was observed to synergize with CpG-containing oligonucleotide, type A, DNA to promote human pDC activation. pDC type I IFN responses to TFAM and CpG-containing oligonucleotide, type A, DNA indicated their engagement with receptors for advanced glycation end products and TLR9, respectively, and were dependent upon endosomal processing and PI3K, ERK, and NF-κB signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that pDC contribute to sterile immune responses by recognizing the mitochondrial component of necrotic cells and further incriminate TFAM and mitochondrial DNA as likely mediators of pDC activation under these circumstance.
 mitochondrial membrane GTPase mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) is known to regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shape in addition to its mitochondrial fusion effects. However, its role in ER stress is unknown. We report here that induction of ER stress with either thapsigargin or tunicamycin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to up-regulation of Mfn2 mRNA and protein levels with no change in the expression of the mitochondrial shaping factors Mfn1, Opa1, Drp1, and Fis1. Genetic deletion of Mfn2 but not Mfn1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or cardiac myocytes in mice led to an increase in the expression of the ER chaperone proteins. Genetic ablation of Mfn2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts amplified ER stress and exacerbated ER stress-induced apoptosis. Deletion of Mfn2 delayed translational recovery through prolonged eIF2α phosphorylation associated with decreased GADD34 and p58(IPK) expression and elevated C/EBP homologous protein induction at late time points. These changes in the unfolded protein response were coupled to increased cell death reflected by augmented caspase 3/7 activity, lactate dehydrogenase release from cells, and an increase in propidium iodide-positive nuclei in response to thapsigargin or tunicamycin treatment. In contrast, genetic deletion of Mfn1 did not affect ER stress-mediated increase in ER chaperone synthesis or eIF2α phosphorylation. Additionally, ER stress-induced C/EBP homologous protein, GADD34, and p58(IPK) induction and cell death were not affected by loss of Mfn1. We conclude that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is an ER stress-inducible protein that is required for the proper temporal sequence of the ER stress respons.
usly identified novel thiazole derivatives able to reduce histone acetylation and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity in yeast. Among these compounds, 3-methylcyclopentylidene-[4-(4'-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl]hydrazone (CPTH6) has been selected and used throughout this stud.
t of CPTH6 on histone acetylation, cell viability and differentiation, cell-cycle distribution, and apoptosis in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumor cell lines has been evaluate.
showed that CPTH6 leads to an inhibition of Gcn5 and pCAF HAT activity. Moreover, it inhibits H3/H4 histones and α-tubulin acetylation of a panel of leukemia cell lines. Concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of cell viability, paralleled by accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase and depletion from the S/G(2)M phases, was observed. The role of mitochondrial pathway on CPTH6-induced apoptosis was shown, being a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, from mitochondria to cytosol, induced by CPTH6. Also the involvement of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on CPTH6-induced apoptosis was found after overexpression of the two proteins in leukemia cells. Solid tumor cell lines from several origins were shown to be differently sensitive to CPTH6 treatment in terms of cell viability, and a correlation between the inhibitory efficacy on H3/H4 histones acetylation and cytotoxicity was found. Differentiating effect on leukemia and neuroblastoma cell lines was also induced by CPTH.
ults make CPTH6 a suitable tool for discovery of molecular targets of HAT and, potentially, for the development of new anticancer therapies, which warrants further investigation.
ast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) biogenesis is translationally regulated. Mss51, a specific COX1 mRNA translational activator and Cox1 chaperone, drives the regulatory mechanism. During translation and post-translationally, newly synthesized Cox1 physically interacts with a complex of proteins involving Ssc1, Mss51, and Cox14, which eventually hand over Cox1 to the assembly pathway. This step is probably catalyzed by assembly chaperones such as Shy1 in a process coupled to the release of Ssc1-Mss51 from the complex. Impaired COX assembly results in the trapping of Mss51 in the complex, thus limiting its availability for COX1 mRNA translation. An exception is a null mutation in COX14 that does not affect Cox1 synthesis because the Mss51 trapping complexes become unstable, and Mss51 is readily available for translation. Here we present evidence showing that Cox25 is a new essential COX assembly factor that plays some roles similar to Cox14. A null mutation in COX25 by itself or in combination with other COX mutations does not affect Cox1 synthesis. Cox25 is an inner mitochondrial membrane intrinsic protein with a hydrophilic C terminus protruding into the matrix. Cox25 is an essential component of the complexes containing newly synthesized Cox1, Ssc1, Mss51, and Cox14. In addition, Cox25 is also found to interact with Shy1 and Cox5 in a complex that does not contain Mss51. These results suggest that once Ssc1-Mss51 are released from the Cox1 stabilization complex, Cox25 continues to interact with Cox14 and Cox1 to facilitate the formation of multisubunit COX assembly intermediate.
unodeficiency virus-associated neurological disease (HAND) still causes significant morbidity, despite success reducing viral loads with combination antiretroviral therapy. The dopamine (DA) system is particularly vulnerable in HAND. We hypothesize that early, &quot;reversible&quot; DAergic synaptic dysfunction occurs long before DAergic neuron loss. As such, aging human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals may be vulnerable to other age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), underscoring the need to understand shared molecular targets in HAND and PD. Previously, we reported that the neurotoxic HIV-1 transactivating factor (Tat) acutely disrupts mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis via ryanodine receptor (RyR) activation. Here, we further report that Tat disrupts DA transporter (DAT) activity and function, resulting in increased plasma membrane (PM) DAT and increased DAT V(max), without changes in K(m) or total DAT protein. Tat also increases calpain protease activity at the PM, demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of a cleavable fluorescent calpain substrate. Tat-increased PM DAT and calpain activity are blocked by the RyR antagonists ryanodine and dantrolene, the calpain inhibitor calpastatin, and by a specific inhibitor of GSK-3β. We conclude that Tat activates RyRs via a calcium- and calpain-mediated mechanism that upregulates DAT trafficking to the PM, and is independent of DAT protein synthesis, reinforcing the feasibility of RyR and GSK-3β inhibition as clinical therapeutic approaches for HAND. Finally, we provide key translational relevance for these findings by highlighting published human data of increased DAT levels in striata of HAND patients and by demonstrating similar findings in Tat-expressing transgenic mic.
ently, human mitochondria were regarded as unusual as they appeared to employ four stop codons to terminate translation. In addition to the UAA/UAG of the universal genetic code, two arginine triplets (AGA/AGG) had been re-assigned as termination signals. This posed the conundrum of what factor was responsible for recognizing these triplets to promote translation termination? Recent data indicates that in fact no protein is required to recognize AGA/AGG. Indeed, it is the absence of any cognate factor, tRNA or polypeptide that is important. On encountering either of these 'hungry' codons at the end of an open reading frame, instead of requiring a novel or modified release factor, human mitoribosomes employ -1 frameshifting to reposition a standard UAG codon in the A-site, indicating that only the universal UAA and UAG are used as stop codons. This renders a single mitochondrial release factor, mtRF1a, previously shown to be capable of terminating 11 of the 13 open reading frames encoded by the mitochondrial genome, to be sufficient to release all nascent human mitochondrial gene products from the mitoribosom.
s that preserve endothelial cell (EC) integrity remain elusive, but are critical for new strategies directed against endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus (DM). Here we demonstrate in primary cerebral ECs with a clinically relevant model of elevated d-glucose that Akt1 and the post-translational modification and subcellular trafficking of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO3a are critical for early apoptotic membrane signaling and subsequent degradation of nuclear DNA. FoxO3a also directly governs apoptotic mitochondrial signal transduction pathways, since gene knockdown of FoxO3a prevents mitochondrial membrane depolarization as well as the release of cytochrome c. Control of this apoptotic cascade extends to the rapid and progressive activation of caspases. The presence of FoxO3a is necessary for cleaved (active) caspase 1 and 3 expression, since loss of FoxO3a abrogates the induction of caspase activity. Our work identifies Akt1, FoxO3a and closely aligned pathways as key therapeutic targets during impaired glucose tolerance and D.
on termination is accomplished by proteins of the Class I release factor family (RF) that recognize stop codons and catalyze the ribosomal release of the newly synthesized peptide. Bacteria have two canonical RFs: RF1 recognizes UAA and UAG, RF2 recognizes UAA and UGA. Despite that these two release factor proteins are sufficient for de facto translation termination, the eukaryotic organellar RF protein family, which has evolved from bacterial release factors, has expanded considerably, comprising multiple subfamilies, most of which have not been functionally characterized or formally classified. Here, we integrate multiple sources of information to analyze the remarkable differentiation of the RF family among organelles. We document the origin, phylogenetic distribution and sequence structure features of the mitochondrial and plastidial release factors: mtRF1a, mtRF1, mtRF2a, mtRF2b, mtRF2c, ICT1, C12orf65, pRF1, and pRF2, and review published relevant experimental data. The canonical release factors (mtRF1a, mtRF2a, pRF1, and pRF2) and ICT1 are derived from bacterial ancestors, whereas the others have resulted from gene duplications of another release factor. These new RF family members have all lost one or more specific motifs relevant for bona fide release factor function but are mostly targeted to the same organelle as their ancestor. We also characterize the subset of canonical release factor proteins that bear nonclassical PxT/SPF tripeptide motifs and provide a molecular-model-based rationale for their retained ability to recognize stop codons. Finally, we analyze the coevolution of canonical RFs with the organellar genetic code. Although the RF presence in an organelle and its stop codon usage tend to coevolve, we find three taxa that encode an RF2 without using UGA stop codons, and one reverse scenario, where mamiellales green algae use UGA stop codons in their mitochondria without having a mitochondrial type RF2. For the latter, we put forward a &quot;stop-codon reinvention&quot; hypothesis that involves the retargeting of the plastid release factor to the mitochondrio.
a vertebrate mitochondrial protein with an unknown function that arose from a duplication of the mitochondrial release factor mtRF1a. To elucidate the function of mtRF1, we determined the positions that are conserved among mtRF1 sequences but that are different in their mtRF1a paralogs. We subsequently modeled the 3D structure of mtRF1a and mtRF1 bound to the ribosome, highlighting the structural implications of these differences to derive a hypothesis for the function of mtRF.
 predicts, in agreement with the experimental data, that the 3D structure of mtRF1a allows it to recognize the stop codons UAA and UAG in the A-site of the ribosome. In contrast, we show that mtRF1 likely can only bind the ribosome when the A-site is devoid of mRNA. Furthermore, while mtRF1a will adopt its catalytic conformation, in which it functions as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase in the ribosome, only upon binding of a stop codon in the A-site, mtRF1 appears specifically adapted to assume this extended, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolyzing conformation in the absence of mRNA in the A-sit.
t that mtRF1 specifically recognizes ribosomes with an empty A-site and is able to function as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase in those situations. Stalled ribosomes with empty A-sites that still contain a tRNA bound to a peptide chain can result from the translation of truncated, stop-codon less mRNAs. We hypothesize that mtRF1 recycles such stalled ribosomes, performing a function that is analogous to that of tmRNA in bacteri.
igated the genetic basis for a global and uniform decrease in mitochondrial translation in fibroblasts from patients in two unrelated pedigrees who developed Leigh syndrome, optic atrophy, and ophthalmoplegia. Analysis of the assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes showed severe decreases of complexes I, IV, and V and a smaller decrease in complex III. The steady-state levels of mitochondrial mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs were not reduced, nor were those of the mitochondrial translation elongation factors or the protein components of the mitochondrial ribosome. Using homozygosity mapping, we identified a 1 bp deletion in C12orf65 in one patient, and DNA sequence analysis showed a different 1 bp deletion in the second patient. Both mutations predict the same premature stop codon. C12orf65 belongs to a family of four mitochondrial class I peptide release factors, which also includes mtRF1a, mtRF1, and Ict1, all characterized by the presence of a GGQ motif at the active site. However, C12orf65 does not exhibit peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity in an in vitro assay with bacterial ribosomes. We suggest that it might play a role in recycling abortive peptidyl-tRNA species, released from the ribosome during the elongation phase of translatio.
e mitochondria use stop codons UAA and UAG decoded by the release factor (RF) MTRF1L and two reassigned arginine codons, AGA and AGG. A second highly conserved RF-like factor, MTRF1, which evolved from a gene duplication of an ancestral mitochondrial RF1 and not a RF2, is a good candidate for recognizing the nonstandard codons. MTRF1 differs from other RFs by having insertions in the two external loops important for stop codon recognition (tip of helix alpha5 and recognition loop) and by having key substitutions that are involved in stop codon interactions in eubacterial RF/ribosome structures. These changes may allow recognition of the larger purine base in the first position of AGA/G and, uniquely for RFs, only of G at position 2. In contrast, residues that support A and G recognition in the third position in RF1 are conserved as would be required for recognition of AGA and AGG. Since an assay with vertebrate mitochondrial ribosomes has not been established, we modified Escherichia coli RF1 at the helix alpha5 and recognition loop regions to mimic MTRF1. There was loss of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis activity with standard stop codons beginning with U (e.g., UAG), but a gain of activity with codons beginning with A (AAG in particular). A lower level of activity with AGA could be enhanced by solvent modification. These observations imply that MTRF1 has the characteristics to recognize A as the first base of a stop codon as would be required to decode the nonstandard codons AGA and AG.
eres are nucleoprotein complexes essential for maintaining the genomic integrity of linear chromosomes. Six telomere localizing proteins form a complex named &quot;shelterin/telosome&quot; to cooperatively regulate telomere length and protect chromosomal ends from DNA damage and repair responses. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking TRF1, a shelterin component, exhibit a high-incidence of broken or lost telomere FISH signals, supporting a critical role for TRF1 in telomere maintenance. We demonstrate that these abnormal telomere structures are not caused by the inability of TRF1-deficient cells to recruit TIN2 but are due to a specific role for TRF1 at telomeres. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the mTRF1 TRF homology (TRFH) domain is crucial for this abnormal telomere FISH phenotype. These novel findings suggest that the TRFH domain is crucial not only for dimerization of TRF1 and TIN2-telomere recruitment, but also telomere stabilizatio.
ere is a functional chromatin structure that consists of G-rich repetitive sequences and various associated proteins. Telomeres protect chromosomal ends from degradation, provide escape from the DNA damage response, and regulate telomere lengthening by telomerase. Multiple proteins that localize at telomeres form a complex called shelterin/telosome. One component, TRF1, is a double-stranded telomeric DNA binding protein. Inactivation of TRF1 disrupts telomeric localization of other shelterin components and induces chromosomal instability. Here, we examined how the telomeric localization of shelterin components is crucial for TRF1-mediated telomere-associated functions. We found that many of the mTRF1 deficient phenotypes, including chromosomal instability, growth defects, and dysfunctional telomere damage response, were suppressed by the telomere localization of shelterin components in the absence of functional mTRF1. However, abnormal telomere signals and telomere elongation phenotypes were either not rescued or only partially rescued, respectively. These data suggest that TRF1 regulates telomere length and function by at least two mechanisms; in one TRF1 acts through the recruiting/tethering of other shelterin components to telomeres, and in the other TRF1 seems to play a more direct rol.
amster cells frequently have altered karyotypes. To investigate the basis of recent observations that karyotypic alterations are related to telomeric fusions, we asked whether these alterations are due to lack of telomere repeat binding factor/s. Further, Chinese hamster chromosomes contain large blocks of interstitial telomeric repeats, which are preferentially involved in chromosome breakage and exchange, rendering it an interesting model for such studies. Here, we report on the cloning and the chromosomal localization of the Chinese hamster telomere repeat binding factor, chTRF1. The sequence analysis revealed, similar to human TRF1 (hTRF1), an N-terminal acidic domain, a TRF1 specific DNA binding motif and a C-terminal Myb type domain. Unlike mouse TRF1 (mTRF1), chTRF1 shows 97.5% identity to hTRF1. chTRF1 gene was localized on the long arm of chromosome 5. In vitro translation of chTRF1 resulted in protein product similar in molecular weight to hTRF1. Immunostaining of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) with anti-TRF1 antibody revealed punctate nuclear staining. At metaphase, antibodies failed to detect TRF1 on most of the chromosome ends and the interstitial telomeric repeat bands. These studies suggest that chTRF1 does not bind the interstitial telomeric repeats, and its presence at the metaphase chromosome ends is limited. The later could be a factor contributing to frequent karyotypic alterations observed in Chinese hamster cell.
 chromosome ends contain long arrays of TTAGGG repeats that are complexed to a telomere specific protein, the TTAGGG repeat binding factor, TRF1. Here we describe the characterization of genes encoding the human and mouse TRF1 proteins, hTRF1 and mTRF1. The mTRF1 cDNA was isolated based on sequence similarity to the hTRF1 cDNA and the mTRF1 mRNA was shown to be ubiquitously expressed as a single 1.9 kb polyadenylated transcript in mouse somatic tissues. High levels of a 2.1 kb transcript were found in testes. In vitro translation of the mTRF1 cDNA resulted in a 56 kDa protein that binds to TTAGGG repeat arrays. mTRF1 displayed the same sequence specificity as hTRF1, preferring arrays of TTAGGG repeats as a binding substrate over TTAGGC and TTGGGG repeats. Expression of an epitope-tagged version of mTRF1 showed that the protein is located at the ends of murine metaphase chromosomes. In agreement, conceptual translation indicated that mTRF1 and hTRF1 are similarly-sized proteins with nearly identical C-terminal Myb-related DNA binding motifs. In addition, comparison of the predicted mTRF1 and hTRF1 amino acid sequences showed that the acidic nature of the N-terminus of TRF1 is conserved and revealed a highly conserved novel domain of approximately 200 amino acids in the middle of the proteins. However, other regions of the proteins are poorly conserved (&lt;35% identity) and the overall level of identity of the mTRF1 and hTRF1 amino acid sequences is only 67%. The TRF1 genes are not syntenic; the hTRF1 gene localized to human chromosome 8 band q13 while the mTRF1 gene localized to mouse chromosome 17 band E3. The data indicate that the genes for mammalian telomeric proteins evolve rapidl.
n proteins were demonstrated to play key roles in various biological processes such as embryonic development, cell lineage determination, and cancer differentiation. Actin binding LIM protein 1 (abLIM1) was reported to be localized in a genomic region often deleted in human cancers and suggested to be involved in axon guidance. Recently, existence of a second family member was reported, actin binding LIM protein 2. By means of computational biology and comparative genomics, we now characterized an additional, third member of the actin binding LIM protein subgroup, actin binding LIM protein 3 (abLIM3). The human mRNA sequence was previously annotated as differentially regulated in hepatoblastoma compared to normal livers. Conservation of key structural features of abLIM1 and abLIM2, four LIM domains and a VHD domain, suggested comparable biological function of abLIM3 as a linker between actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways. AbLIM3 was found to be conserved in vertebrates, as orthologous sequences were characterized for mouse, fish, and frog. In addition, we report the existence of abLIM2 orthologs in fish and frog, suggesting a similar degree of evolutionary conservation. The intracellular localization of the abLIM3 protein was predicted to be nuclear by means of Reinhardt's neural network and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The corresponding abLIM3 gene was localized to chromosome 5q32 and spanned 119 kb, organized in 24 exons. An RT-PCR based expression profile available from the human unidentified gene-encoded (HUGE) database demonstrated highest expression for abLIM3 in heart, lung, liver, and brain/cerebellum accompanied by lower expression in multiple other tissues. Furthermore, abLIM3 was expressed in fetal liver, CNS, and spinal cor.
idence shows that nitric oxide (NO) may exhibit both pro-cancer and anti-cancer activities. The present study aimed to determine the differentially expressed proteins in NO-treated NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in order to investigate whether NO induces proteins with pro-cancer or anti-cancer effect.
 were treated with 300 μM of an NO donor 3,3-bis-(aminoethyl)-1-hydroxy-2-oxo-1-triazene (NOC-18) for 12 h. The changed protein patterns, which were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis using pH gradients of 4-7, were conclusively identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis of the peptide digest.
 differentially expressed proteins were identified in NOC-18-treated cells. Nine proteins [vinculin protein, keratin 19, ubiquitous tropomodulin, F-actin capping protein (α1 subunit), tropomyosin 3, 26S proteasome-associated pad1 homolog, T-complex protein 1 (ε subunit) N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, and heat shock protein 90] were increased and eight proteins (heat shock protein 70, glucosidase II, lamin B1, calreticulin, nucleophosmin 1, microtubule-associated protein retinitis pigmentosa/end binding family member 1, 150 kD oxygen-regulated protein precursor, and heat shock 70-related protein albino or pale green 2) were decreased by NOC-18 in the cells. Thirteen proteins are related to the suppression of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis while two proteins (heat shock protein 90 and N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase) are related to carcinogenesis. The functions of 150 kD oxygen-regulated protein precursor and T-complex protein 1 (ε subunit) are unknown in relation to carcinogenesi.
eins differentially expressed by NOC-18 are involved in inhibiting cancer developmen.
f array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool in molecular genetics has facilitated the identification of many new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (MMSs). Furthermore, this method has allowed for the identification of copy number variations (CNVs) whose pathogenic role has yet to be uncovered. Here, we report on our application of array CGH for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in 79 Russian children with intellectual disability (ID). Twenty-six pathogenic or likely pathogenic changes in copy number were detected in 22 patients (28%): 8 CNVs corresponded to known MMSs, and 17 were not associated with previously described syndromes. In this report, we describe our findings and comment on genes potentially associated with ID that are located within the CNV region.
rich protein (CRP) 2, a member of the LIM-only CRP family that contains two LIM domains, is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of blood vessels and functions to repress VSMC migration and vascular remodelling. The goal of this study was to define the molecular mechanisms by which CRP2 regulates VSMC migratio.
ion of VSMCs with CRP2-EGFP constructs revealed that CRP2 associated with the actin cytoskeleton. In response to chemoattractant stimulation, Csrp2 (mouse CRP2 gene symbol)-deficient (Csrp2(-/-)) VSMCs exhibited increased lamellipodia formation. Re-introduction of CRP2 abrogated the enhanced lamellipodia formation and migration of Csrp2(-/-) VSMCs following chemoattractant stimulation. Mammalian 2-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CRP2 interacts with p130Cas, a scaffold protein important for lamellipodia formation and cell motility. Immunofluorescence staining showed that CRP2 colocalized with phospho-p130Cas at focal adhesions (FAs)/terminal ends of stress fibres in non-migrating cells. Interestingly, in migrating cells phospho-p130Cas localized to the leading edge of lamellipodia and FAs, whereas CRP2 was restricted to FAs and stress fibres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p130Cas expression and phosphorylation promote neointima formation following arterial injur.
dies demonstrate that CRP2 sequesters p130Cas at FAs, thereby reducing lamellipodia formation and blunting VSMC migratio.
n of the platelet actin cytoskeleton by the Rho family of small GTPases is essential for the proper maintenance of hemostasis. However, little is known about how intracellular platelet activation from Rho GTPase family members, including Rac, Cdc42, and Rho, translate into changes in platelet actin structures. To better understand how Rho family GTPases coordinate platelet activation, we identified platelet proteins associated with Rac1, a Rho GTPase family member, and actin regulatory protein essential for platelet hemostatic function. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that upon platelet activation with thrombin, Rac1 associates with a set of effectors of the p21-activated kinases (PAKs), including GIT1, βPIX, and guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEFH1. Platelet activation by thrombin triggered the PAK-dependent phosphorylation of GIT1, GEFH1, and other PAK effectors, including LIMK1 and Merlin. PAK was also required for the thrombin-mediated activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, Akt, calcium signaling, and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure. Inhibition of PAK signaling prevented thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and blocked platelet focal adhesion and lamellipodia formation in response to thrombin. Together, these results demonstrate that the PAK signaling system is a key orchestrator of platelet actin dynamics, linking Rho GTPase activation downstream of thrombin stimulation to PAK effector function, MAP kinase activation, calcium signaling, and PS exposure in platelet.
esions are intricate protein complexes that facilitate cell attachment, migration, and cellular communication. Lasp-2 (LIM-nebulette), a member of the nebulin family of actin-binding proteins, is a newly identified component of these complexes. To gain further insights into the functional role of lasp-2, we identified two additional binding partners of lasp-2: the integral focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin. Of interest, the interaction of lasp-2 with its binding partners vinculin and paxillin is significantly reduced in the presence of lasp-1, another nebulin family member. The presence of lasp-2 appears to enhance the interaction of vinculin and paxillin with each other; however, as with the interaction of lasp-2 with vinculin or paxillin, this effect is greatly diminished in the presence of excess lasp-1. This suggests that the interplay between lasp-2 and lasp-1 could be an adhesion regulatory mechanism. Lasp-2's potential role in metastasis is revealed, as overexpression of lasp-2 in either SW620 or PC-3B1 cells-metastatic cancer cell lines-increases cell migration but impedes cell invasion, suggesting that the enhanced interaction of vinculin and paxillin may functionally destabilize focal adhesion composition. Taken together, these data suggest that lasp-2 has an important role in coordinating and regulating the composition and dynamics of focal adhesion.
n homology domain-containing, family H (with MyTH4 domain), member 2 (Plekhh2) is a 1491-residue intracellular protein highly enriched in renal glomerular podocytes for which no function has been ascribed. Analysis of renal biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis revealed a significant reduction in total podocyte Plekhh2 expression compared to controls. Sequence analysis indicated a putative α-helical coiled-coil segment as the only recognizable domain within the N-terminal half of the polypeptide, while the C-terminal half contains two PH, a MyTH4, and a FERM domain. We identified a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate consensus-binding site in the PH1 domain required for Plekhh2 localization to peripheral regions of cell lamellipodia. The N-terminal half of Plekkh2 is not necessary for lamellipodial targeting but mediates self-association. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that Plekhh2 directly interacts through its FERM domain with the focal adhesion protein Hic-5 and actin. Plekhh2 and Hic-5 coprecipitated and colocalized at the soles of podocyte foot processes in situ and Hic-5 partially relocated from focal adhesions to lamellipodia in Plekhh2-expressing podocytes. In addition, Plekhh2 stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton by attenuating actin depolymerization. Our findings suggest a structural and functional role for Plekhh2 in the podocyte foot processe.
 arborization is important for neuronal development as well as the formation of neural circuits. Rac1 is a member of the Rho GTPase family that serve as regulators of neuronal development. Breakpoint cluster region protein (BCR) is a Rac1 GTPase-activating protein that is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. Here, we show that BCR plays a key role in neuronal development. Dendritic arborization and actin polymerization were attenuated by overexpression of BCR in hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of BCR using specific shRNAs increased the dendritic arborization as well as actin polymerization. The number of dendrites in null mutant BCR(-/-) mice was considerably increased compared with that in wild-type mice. We found that the function of the BCR GTPase-activating domain could be modulated by protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor T (PTPRT), which is expressed principally in the brain. We demonstrate that tyrosine 177 of BCR was the main target of PTPRT and the BCR mutant mimicking dephosphorylation of tyrosine 177 alleviated the attenuation of dendritic arborization. Additionally the attenuated dendritic arborization found upon BCR overexpression was relieved upon co-expression of PTPRT. When PTPRT was knocked down by a specific shRNA, the dendritic arborization was significantly reduced. The activity of the BCR GTPase-activating domain was modulated by means of conversions between the intra- and inter-molecular interactions, which are finely regulated through the dephosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue by PTPRT. We thus show conclusively that BCR is a novel substrate of PTPRT and that BCR is involved in the regulation of neuronal development via control of the BCR GTPase-activating domain function by PTPR.
ine-rich protein (CRP) family is a subgroup of LIM domain proteins. CRP1, which cross-links actin filaments to make actin bundles, is the only CRP family member expressed in the CNS with little known about its function in nerve cells. Here, we report that CRP1 colocalizes with actin in the filopodia of growth cones in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of CRP1 expression by short hairpin RNA interference results in inhibition of filopodia formation and dendritic growth in neurons. Overexpression of CRP1 increases filopodia formation and neurite branching, which require its actin-bundling activity. Expression of CRP1 with a constitutively active form of Cdc42, a GTPase involved in filopodia formation, increases filopodia formation in COS-7 cells, suggesting cooperation between the two proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that neuronal activity upregulates CRP1 expression in hippocampal neurons via Ca²⁺ influx after depolarization. Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and cAMP response element binding protein mediate the Ca²⁺-induced upregulation of CRP1 expression. Furthermore, CRP1 is required for the dendritic growth induced by Ca²⁺ influx or CaMKIV. Together, these data are the first to demonstrate a role for CRP1 in dendritic growt.
member of the alpha-actinin-associated LIM protein (ALP)/enigma protein family, plays a role in neurite outgrowth in the peripheral nervous system. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not known. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of an E18 mouse whole-body cDNA library with CLP36 as the bait and isolated palladin as a CLP36-binding protein. Palladin is an actin-binding protein and it was shown to have a role in the extension of cortical neurons. A coimmunoprecipitation study showed that CLP36 and palladin formed a complex in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). In addition, CLP36 and palladin were colocalized in the neurites and cell bodies of primary DRG neurons. Furthermore, sciatic nerve transection increased the expression of both CLP36 and palladin mRNAs in DRG neurons, with the increase in CLP36 mRNA being more prominent. This implies that CLP36 has a more specific role in nerve regeneration than palladin. Our results suggest that CLP36 may interact with palladin to influence neurite outgrowth during sciatic nerve regeneratio.
an actin-binding, signaling pathway-regulated phosphoprotein that is overexpressed in several cancers. siRNA knockdown in cell lines retards cell migration, suggesting the possibility that Lasp1 upregulation influences cancer metastasis. Herein, we utilized a recently developed gene knockout model to assess the role of Lasp1 in modulating nontransformed cell functions. Wound healing and tumor initiation progressed more rapidly in Lasp1(-/-) mice compared with Lasp1(+/+) controls. Embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Lasp1(-/-) mice also migrated more rapidly in vitro. These MEFs characteristically possessed increased focal adhesion numbers and displayed more rapid attachment compared with wild-type MEFs. Differential microarray analyses revealed alterations in message expression for proteins implicated in cell migration, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization. Notably, the focal adhesion protein, lipoma preferred partner (LPP), a zyxin family member and putative Lasp1 binding protein, was increased about twofold. Because LPP gene disruption reduces cell migration, we hypothesize that LPP plays a role in enhancing the migratory capacity of Lasp1(-/-) MEFs, perhaps by modifying the subcellular localization of other motility-associated proteins. The striking contrast in the functional effects of loss of Lasp1 in innate cells compared with cell lines reveals distinct differences in mechanisms of motility and attachment in these model.
a member of the Shaker family of voltage-sensitive potassium channels and contributes to regulation of membrane excitability. The electrophysiological activity of Kv1.2 undergoes tyrosine kinase-dependent suppression in a process involving RhoA. We report that RhoA elicits suppression of Kv1.2 ionic current by modulating channel endocytosis. This occurs through two distinct pathways, one clathrin-dependent and the other cholesterol-dependent. Activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) via the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor elicits clathrin-dependent Kv1.2 endocytosis and consequent attenuation of its ionic current. LPA-induced channel endocytosis is blocked by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or by clathrin RNA interference. In contrast, steady-state endocytosis of Kv1.2 in unstimulated cells is cholesterol dependent. Inhibition of basal ROCK signaling with Y27632 increased surface Kv1.2, an effect that persists in the presence of clathrin small interfering RNA and that is not additive to the increase in surface channel levels elicited by the cholesterol sequestering drug filipin. Temperature block experiments show that ROCK affects cholesterol-dependent trafficking by modulating the recycling of endocytosed channel back to the plasma membrane. Both receptor-stimulated and steady-state Kv1.2 trafficking modulated by RhoA/ROCK required the activation of dynamin as well as the ROCK effector Lim-kinase, indicating a key role for actin remodeling in RhoA-dependent Kv1.2 regulatio.
er protein 185 (ZFP185), which contains a conservative Lin-l 1, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM) domain at its C-terminus, is a member of mouse LIM protein family. Although brahma-related gene 1(BRG1), the upstream regulation gene of ZFP185, is essential in the development and activation of T lymphocytes, there is no report on the involvement of ZFP185 in lymphocyte activation. The expression of ZFP185 protein was up-regulated significantly in T lymphocytes during their activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin, compared with non-activated T lymphocytes, as determined by western blot assays. However, over-expression of ZFP185 in EL4 cells showed no significant effect on the cell proliferation. Importantly, expression of ZFP185-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein in EL4 cells showed that ZFP185 uniquely localized in the uropod of lymphocytes as observed with a two-photon laser scanning confocal microscope. The direct interaction between ZFP185 and actin was supported by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. The special distribution of ZFP185 in uropod indicates the potential involvement of ZFP185 in T-cell morphology and movemen.
in family of actin-binding proteins plays an important role in actin filament dynamics in a variety of cells including striated muscle. We report here the identification of a new striated muscle Z-disc associated protein: lasp-2 (LIM and SH3 domain protein-2). Lasp-2 is the most recently identified member of the nebulin family. To evaluate the role of lasp-2 in striated muscle, lasp-2 gene expression and localization were studied in chick and mouse tissue, as well as in primary cultures of chick cardiac and skeletal myocytes. Lasp-2 mRNA was detected as early as chick embryonic stage 25 and lasp-2 protein was associated with developing premyofibril structures, Z-discs of mature myofibrils, focal adhesions, and intercalated discs of cultured cardiomyocytes. Expression of GFP-tagged lasp-2 deletion constructs showed that the C-terminal region of lasp-2 is important for its localization in striated muscle cells. Lasp-2 organizes actin filaments into bundles and interacts directly with the Z-disc protein alpha-actinin. These results are consistent with a function of lasp-2 as a scaffolding and actin filament organizing protein within striated muscle Z-disc.
f the ALP/Enigma family of PDZ-LIM proteins play a role in cytoskeletal anchorage and mutations in at least one member of this family are associated with human cardiomyopathy. Here, we describe the analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans alp-1 gene. alp-1 is predicted to encode the entire nematode ALP/Enigma protein family, consisting of one ALP-related protein with a single LIM domain and three Enigma-like proteins containing four LIM domains. We demonstrate that the ALP-1 proteins are expressed in muscle cells, where they localize to actin anchorage and muscle attachment sites. We show that the PDZ domain of the ALP-1 proteins is sufficient to target the protein to the dense bodies, which are important actin anchorage sites in C. elegans body wall muscle. We demonstrate that the C. elegans ALP/Enigma proteins are also localized to cell-cell junctions and to both epithelial and muscle cell nuclei. These findings suggest new roles for the ALP/Enigma protein family that may lead to the understanding of their involvement in cardiomyopath.
g evidence for the contractile nature of fish branchial pillar cells was provided by demonstrating the presence of actin fibers and a novel four-and-a-half LIM (FHL) protein in which expression is specific for contractile tissues and sensitive to the tension applied to the pillar cell. When eel gill sections were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, a selective fluorescent probe for fibrous actin, a strong bundle-like staining was observed around collagen columns in pillar cells, suggesting the presence of abundant actin fibers. A cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the actin-binding FHL family, FHL5, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library of eel gill. Northern analysis revealed that FHL5 mRNA is highly expressed only in gills, heart, and skeletal muscle. In gills, FHL5 was found to be confined to pillar cells by immunohistochemistry. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that FHL5 is present in both cytosol and nucleus; within the cytosol, a large portion of FHL5 is colocalized with the phalloidin-positive actin bundles. Furthermore, transfection of myogenic C2C12 cells with FHL5 cDNA demonstrated, in addition to its interaction with actin stress fibers, a nuclear shuttling activity of FHL5. The mRNA and protein levels were found to be elevated on 1) transfer of eels from seawater to freshwater, 2) volume expansion by infusion of isotonic dextran-saline, and 3) constriction of gill vasculature by bolus injection of endothelin-1. These results suggest contractile nature of pillar cells and a role of FHL5 in maintaining the integrity and regulating the dynamics of pillar cell.
ardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), while mutations in multiple genes cause autosomal dominant DCM. Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Based upon these data, and the recent descriptions of mutations in MLP in patients with DCM or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we screened patients for mutations in the MLP and alpha-actinin-2 genes. We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R). This is within a highly conserved region adjacent to the first LIM domain involved in alpha-actinin binding. Analysis in cell culture systems demonstrated that the mutation abolishes the interaction between MLP and alpha-actinin-2 and the cellular localization of MLP was altered. In another individual with DCM, a W4R mutation was identified. However, this mutation did not segregate with disease in this family. In another patient with DCM, a Q9R mutation was identified in alpha-actinin-2. This mutation also disrupted the interaction with MLP and appeared to inhibit alpha-actinin function in cultured cells, in respect to the nuclear localization of actinin and the initiation of cellular differentiatio.
a preferred partner LPP is a member of the zyxin family of proteins. In this paper, we demonstrate that the structural similarities observed between zyxin and LPP also extend to their interaction capabilities. Similar to zyxin, LPP was found to bind to alpha-actinin in vitro. This interaction was confirmed in yeast and mammalian cells. Studies utilizing the three-hybrid system further indicated that zyxin and LPP compete for the same binding site in alpha-actinin. This site was mapped to the central rod of alpha-actinin, which contains spectrin-like repeats 2 and 3. In the case of LPP, a conserved motif present at the N-terminus was shown to be responsible for the interaction. Constructs lacking this motif did not bind to alpha-actinin in the yeast two-hybrid system and were not able to recruit alpha-actinin to an ectopic site in mammalian cells. Quantitative data obtained with the two-hybrid and the three-hybrid system suggest that LPP has a lower affinity for alpha-actinin than zyxin. It is likely that this difference leads to slightly different roles played by LPP and zyxin during the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesion.
member of the paxillin family of adaptor molecules, is localized at focal adhesion and implicated in integrin-mediated signaling. Hic-5 and paxillin exhibit structural homology and share interacting factors, however, diverse functions are suggested for them. In this study, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening to identify Hic-5 interacting factors using its LD3-4 region, which includes the Hic-5-specific amino acid sequence, as a bait. Through the screening, we identified GIT1, an Arf GTPase-activating protein, as a Hic-5 binding protein. The interaction of these two proteins was mediated by the LD3 motif of Hic-5 and the C-terminal region, which includes a paxillin-binding subdomain, of GIT1. Although GIT1 is known as a paxillin-binding protein, we only observed weak association of paxillin with GIT1 in the overexpression system. In contrast, Hic-5 firmly bound to GIT1 under the same conditions. In addition, the paxillin/GIT1 complex contained PIX, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, whereas the Hic-5/GIT1 complex contained a smaller amount of PIX. These results suggested that paxillin and Hic-5 associate with GIT1 with different binding modes, and that the Hic-5 complex possesses static features compared with the paxillin complex, which contains both positive and negative regulators of GTPases involved in actin dynamics. Moreover, Hic-5-mediated inhibition of cell spreading was restored by co-expression of the C-terminal fragment of GIT1, which perturbs the interaction of Hic-5 with endogenous GIT1. Thus, it was demonstrated that Hic-5 and GIT1 interact functionally in addition to showing a physical associatio.
ization of proteins to particular intracellular compartments often regulates their functions. Zyxin is a LIM protein found prominently at sites of cell adhesion, faintly in leading lamellipodia, and transiently in cell nuclei. Here we have performed a domain analysis to identify regions in zyxin that are responsible for targeting it to different subcellular locations. The N-terminal proline-rich region of zyxin, which harbors binding sites for alpha-actinin and members of the Ena/VASP family, concentrates in lamellipodial extensions and weakly in focal adhesions. The LIM region of zyxin displays robust targeting to focal adhesions. When overexpressed in cells, the LIM region of zyxin causes displacement of endogenous zyxin from focal adhesions. Upon mislocalization of full-length zyxin, at least one member of the Ena/VASP family is also displaced, and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton is perturbed. Zyxin also has the capacity to shuttle between the nucleus and focal adhesion sites. When nuclear export is inhibited, zyxin accumulates in cell nuclei. The nuclear accumulation of zyxin occurs asynchronously with approximately half of the cells exhibiting nuclear localization of zyxin within 2.3 h of initiating leptomycin B treatment. Our results provide insight into the functions of different zyxin domain.
on to regulating cell motility, contractility, and cytokinesis, the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the regulation of transcription and gene expression. We have previously identified a novel muscle-specific actin-binding protein, STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signaling), which directly binds actin and stimulates serum-response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription. To further dissect the STARS/SRF pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle cDNA library using STARS as bait, and we identified two novel members of the ABLIM protein family, ABLIM-2 and -3, as STARS-interacting proteins. ABLIM-1, which is expressed in retina, brain, and muscle tissue, has been postulated to function as a tumor suppressor. ABLIM-2 and -3 display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns with the highest expression levels in muscle and neuronal tissue. Moreover, these novel ABLIM proteins strongly bind F-actin, are localized to actin stress fibers, and synergistically enhance STARS-dependent activation of SRF. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ABLIM expression utilizing small interfering RNA significantly blunted SRF-dependent transcription in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. These findings suggest that the members of the novel ABLIM protein family may serve as a scaffold for signaling modules of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby modulate transcriptio.
reat efforts to improve survival rates, the prognosis of lung cancer patients is still very poor, mainly due to high invasiveness. We developed brain metastatic PC14PE6/LvBr4 cells through intracardiac injection of lung adenocarcinoma PC14PE6 cells. Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses revealed that PC14PE6/LvBr4 cells had mesenchymal characteristics and higher invasiveness than PC14PE6 cells. We found that cyclin D1 was upregulated, miR-95-3p was inversely downregulated, and pri-miR-95 and its host gene, ABLIM2, were consistently decreased in PC14PE6/LvBr4 cells. MiR-95-3p suppressed cyclin D1 expression through direct binding to the 3' UTR of cyclin D1 mRNA and suppressed invasiveness, proliferation, and clonogenicity of PC14PE6/LvBr4 cells. Ectopic cyclin D1 reversed miR-95-3p-mediated inhibition of invasiveness and clonogenicity, demonstrating cyclin D1 downregulation is involved in function of miR-95-3p. Using bioluminescence imaging, we found that miR-95-3p suppressed orthotopic tumorigenicity and brain metastasis in vivo and increased overall survival and brain metastasis-free survival. Consistent with in vitro metastatic cells, the levels of miR-95-3p, pri-miR-95, and ABLIM2 mRNA were decreased in brain metastatic tissues compared with lung cancer tissues and higher cyclin D1 expression was involved in poor prognosis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-95-3p is a potential therapeutic target for brain metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cell.
intron structures of the human, rat and mouse ABLIM2 gene were determined in silico. The experimental verification resulted in the revealing of two mRNA isoforms of the ABLIM2 gene. The isoforms a and b contained 20 exons and 18 exons, respectively. The highest expression of both isoforms was observed in rat brain and eye and in mouse embryos. The 5'-UTR region of the ABLIM2 gene was 127 bp in rat and mouse, but in human, it was 65 bp. The site of polyadenylation was shown to be present at a distance of 682 bp from the stop-codon in human and rat and 684 bp in mouse. The in silico analysis of the gene 5'-region was performed. The high density of brain and CNS specific transcription factors' binding sites in the promoter region was shown for all three organisms. The comparison of the amino acid sequences of the human ABLIM2 and ABLIM1 proteins showed that the number and arrangement of domains (four LIM-domains in the N-end region and the C-end VHP-domain) were similar. The structure of the ABLIM2 proteins was similar in all three organisms. On the basis of our data, it was assumed that the ABLIM2 protein was necessary for the normal functioning of neuron.
ctivated protein kinase 4 (MAP4K4) regulates the MEK kinase cascade and is implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement and migration; however, identifying MAP4K4 substrates has remained a challenge. To ascertain MAP4K4-dependent phosphorylation events, we combined phosphoproteomic studies of MAP4K4 inhibition with in vitro assessment of its kinase specificity. We identified 235 phosphosites affected by MAP4K4 inhibition in cells and found that pTP and pSP motifs were predominant among them. In contrast, in vitro assessment of kinase specificity showed that MAP4K4 favors a pTL motif. We showed that MAP4K4 directly phosphorylates and coimmunoprecipitates with FERM, RhoGEF, and pleckstrin domain-containing protein 1 (FARP1). MAP4K4 inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells increases neurite outgrowth, a process known to involve FARP1. As FARP1 and MAP4K4 both contribute to cytoskeletal rearrangement, the results suggest that MAP4K4 exerts some of its effects on the cytoskeleton via phosphorylation of FARP.
iological roles for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) have necessitated the identification of potent inhibitors in order to study its function in various disease contexts. In particular, compounds that can be used to carry out such studies in vivo would be critical for elucidating the potential for therapeutic intervention. A structure-based design effort coupled with property-guided optimization directed at minimizing the ability of the inhibitors to cross into the CNS led to an advanced compound 13 (GNE-495) that showed excellent potency and good PK and was used to demonstrate in vivo efficacy in a retinal angiogenesis model recapitulating effects that were observed in the inducible Map4k4 knockout mic.
n vitro suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) attenuates insulin signaling, but confirmation in vivo is lacking since Map4k4 knockout is lethal during embryogenesis. We thus generated mice with floxed Map4k4 alleles and a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/ERT2 recombinase under the control of the ubiquitin C promoter to induce whole-body Map4k4 deletion after these animals reached maturity. Tamoxifen administration to these mice induced Map4k4 deletion in all tissues examined, causing decreased fasting blood glucose concentrations and enhanced insulin signaling to AKT in adipose tissue and liver but not in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, however, mice generated with a conditional Map4k4 deletion in adiponectin-positive adipocytes or in albumin-positive hepatocytes displayed no detectable metabolic phenotypes. Instead, mice with Map4k4 deleted in Myf5-positive tissues, including all skeletal muscles tested, were protected from obesity-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Remarkably, these mice also showed increased insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue but not skeletal muscle, similar to the metabolic phenotypes observed in inducible whole-body knockout mice. Taken together, these results indicate that (i) Map4k4 controls a pathway in Myf5-positive cells that suppresses whole-body insulin sensitivity and (ii) Map4k4 is a potential therapeutic target for improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabete.
dal crystal toxins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are widely used as biopesticide sprays or expressed in transgenic crops to control insect pests. However, large-scale use of Bt has led to field-evolved resistance in several lepidopteran pests. Resistance to Bt Cry1Ac toxin in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), was previously mapped to a multigenic resistance locus (BtR-1). Here, we assembled the 3.15 Mb BtR-1 locus and found high-level resistance to Cry1Ac and Bt biopesticide in four independent P. xylostella strains were all associated with differential expression of a midgut membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALP) outside this locus and a suite of ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily C (ABCC) genes inside this locus. The interplay between these resistance genes is controlled by a previously uncharacterized trans-regulatory mechanism via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Molecular, biochemical, and functional analyses have established ALP as a functional Cry1Ac receptor. Phenotypic association experiments revealed that the recessive Cry1Ac resistance was tightly linked to down-regulation of ALP, ABCC2 and ABCC3, whereas it was not linked to up-regulation of ABCC1. Silencing of ABCC2 and ABCC3 in susceptible larvae reduced their susceptibility to Cry1Ac but did not affect the expression of ALP, whereas suppression of MAP4K4, a constitutively transcriptionally-activated MAPK upstream gene within the BtR-1 locus, led to a transient recovery of gene expression thereby restoring the susceptibility in resistant larvae. These results highlight a crucial role for ALP and ABCC genes in field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac and reveal a novel trans-regulatory signaling mechanism responsible for modulating the expression of these pivotal genes in P. xylostell.
ly of focal adhesions (FAs) allows cell retraction and integrin detachment from the extracellular matrix, processes critical for cell movement. Growth of microtubules (MTs) can promote FA turnover by serving as tracks to deliver proteins essential for FA disassembly. The molecular nature of this FA &quot;disassembly factor,&quot; however, remains elusive. By quantitative proteomics, we identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) as an FA regulator that associates with MTs. Knockout of MAP4K4 stabilizes FAs and impairs cell migration. By exploring underlying mechanisms, we further show that MAP4K4 associates with ending binding 2 (EB2) and IQ motif and SEC7 domain-containing protein 1 (IQSEC1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for Arf6, whose activation promotes integrin internalization. Together, our findings provide critical insight into FA disassembly, suggesting that MTs can deliver MAP4K4 toward FAs through EB2, where MAP4K4 can, in turn, activate Arf6 via IQSEC1 and enhance FA dissolutio.
igate the genome copy number variation (CNV) related with keloid using the whole-gene resequencing technolog.
pedigree containing 4 generation of 27 people was studied. Five people (4 cases of keloid patients, and 1 case of normal) were selected to extract the genomic DNA. Then the whole-gene resequencing technique was used to check the variations based on the Illumina Hiseq 200.
atabase comparison and variation annotation analysis, 15 CNVs associated with scar hyperplasia were obtained. DAVID software was used to do the Gene Ontology and pathway analysis. Five CNVs were closely related to the keloid formation. They were growth factor receptor-bound 7 (Grb7), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 15 (MAP3K15), kruppel-like factors 7 (KLF7) and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2-2). These CNVs were involved in the process of epidermal cells formation and differentiation, cell exocrine and cell adhesio.
 5 CNVs associated with scar hyperplasia. Especially MAP3K15 and MAP4K4 deserve more research to find their function in keloid formatio.
ctivated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is a serine/threonine kinase implicated in the regulation of many biological processes. A fragment-based lead discovery approach was used to generate potent and selective MAP4K4 inhibitors. The fragment hit pursued in this article had excellent ligand efficiency (LE), an important attribute for subsequent successful optimization into drug-like lead compounds. The optimization efforts eventually led us to focus on the pyridopyrimidine series, from which 6-(2-fluoropyridin-4-yl)pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (29) was identified. This compound had low nanomolar potency, excellent kinase selectivity, and good in vivo exposure, and demonstrated in vivo pharmacodynamic effects in a human tumor xenograft mode.
c modification, particularly changes in DNA methylation at gene promoters, is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, the analysis of DNA methylation in atherosclerosis has been limited to a few selected candidate genes. In this study, we therefore performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in the atherosclerotic human aorta. A total of 48 post-mortem human aortic intima specimens were examined. To avoid the effects of interindividual variation, we performed intraindividual paired comparisons between atheromatous plaque lesions and corresponding plaque-free tissue for 24 subjects. Bisulfite-modified genomic DNA was analyzed for DNA methylation with a specific microarray (Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip). We compensated for multiple comparisons by applying Bonferroni's correction for statistical significance of association. DNA methylation was significantly (P&lt;1.03x10⁻⁷) reduced at 15 CpG sites in 14 genes and increased at 30 CpG sites in 22 genes in atheromatous plaque compared with plaque-free intima. Three of the hypomethylated genes [Drosophila headcase (HECA), early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)] and three of the hypermethylated genes [human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4), zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and FYN] were previously been implicated in atherosclerosis. The overexpression of HECA, EBF1 or NOD2 or the suppression of MAP4K4, ZEB1 or FYN expression in cultured HEK293 cells resulted in significant (P&lt;4.80x10⁻⁷) changes in the expression of atherosclerosis-related genes, as determined with an expression microarray (Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip). Our findings suggested that HECA, EBF1 and NOD2 were significantly hypomethylated, whereas MAP4K4, ZEB1 and FYN were hypermethylated, in atheromatous plaque lesions compared with plaque-free intima. Epigenetic mechanisms may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosi.
f this study was to analyze the roles of miR-143 and miR-145, as well as the gene and protein expression of their targets (KRAS, ERK5, MAP3K3, and MAP4K4) in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH.
ed the specimens of 44 patients diagnosed with BPH who underwent surgical treatment. The control group consisted of prostate samples from 2 young patients who were organ donors. miRNAs and their target genes were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and protein levels were assessed by Western blottin.
nd miR-145 were overexpressed in, respectively, 62.5% and 73.8% of the cases. The ERK5 and MAP4K4 genes were underexpressed respectively in 59.4% and 100% of the BPH samples, whereas KRAS and MAP3K3 were overexpressed respectively in 79.4% and 61.5% of the samples. Increased protein expression was found for both KRAS (4,312.2 luminance/area) and MAP3K3 (7,461.7 luminance/area), while the ERK5 protein was more abundant in the samples from patients with prostate larger than 60 grams (p=0.019.
xpression of miR-143 and miR-145 in BPH samples suggests an association with the pathogenesis of the disease; additionally, the latter miRNA may act through the inhibition of MAP4K4. KRAS and MAP3K3 overexpression may also be associated with BPH pathogenesis. Further analyses are necessary to confirm these result.
lian striatin family consists of three proteins, striatin, S/G2 nuclear autoantigen, and zinedin. Striatin family members have no intrinsic catalytic activity, but rather function as scaffolding proteins. Remarkably, they organize multiple diverse, large signaling complexes that participate in a variety of cellular processes. Moreover, they appear to be regulatory/targeting subunits for the major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. In addition, striatin family members associate with germinal center kinase III kinases as well as other novel components, earning these assemblies the name striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. Recently, there has been a great increase in functional and mechanistic studies aimed at identifying and understanding the roles of STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes in cellular processes of multiple organisms. These studies have identified novel STRIPAK and STRIPAK-like complexes and have explored their roles in specific signaling pathways. Together, the results of these studies have sparked increased interest in striatin family complexes because they have revealed roles in signaling, cell cycle control, apoptosis, vesicular trafficking, Golgi assembly, cell polarity, cell migration, neural and vascular development, and cardiac function. Moreover, STRIPAK complexes have been connected to clinical conditions, including cardiac disease, diabetes, autism, and cerebral cavernous malformation. In this review, we discuss the expression, localization, and protein domain structure of striatin family members. Then we consider the diverse complexes these proteins and their homologs form in various organisms, emphasizing what is known regarding function and regulation. Finally, we explore possible roles of striatin family complexes in disease, especially cerebral cavernous malformatio.
issue lipogenesis is paradoxically impaired in human obesity, promoting ectopic triglyceride (TG) deposition, lipotoxicity, and insulin resistance. We previously identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4), a sterile 20 protein kinase reported to be upstream of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, as a novel negative regulator of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes. Using full-genome microarray analysis we uncovered a novel role for Map4k4 as a suppressor of lipid synthesis. We further report here the surprising finding that Map4k4 suppresses adipocyte lipogenesis independently of JNK. Thus, while Map4k4 silencing in adipocytes enhances the expression of lipogenic enzymes, concomitant with increased conversion of (14)C-glucose and (14)C-acetate into TGs and fatty acids, JNK1 and JNK2 depletion causes the opposite effects. Furthermore, high expression of Map4k4 fails to activate endogenous JNK, while Map4k4 depletion does not attenuate JNK activation by tumor necrosis factor α. Map4k4 silencing in cultured adipocytes elevates both the total protein expression and cleavage of sterol-regulated element binding protein-1 (Srebp-1) in a rapamycin-sensitive manner, consistent with Map4k4 signaling via mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We show Map4k4 depletion requires Srebp-1 upregulation to increase lipogenesis and further show that Map4k4 promotes AMP-protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and the phosphorylation of mTORC1 binding partner raptor (Ser792) to inhibit mTORC1. Our results indicate that Map4k4 inhibits adipose lipogenesis by suppression of Srebp-1 in an AMPK- and mTOR-dependent but JNK-independent mechanis.
lated trimethyl chitosan-cysteine (GTC) nanoparticles (NPs) were developed for oral delivery of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) siRNA (siMap4k4) to the activated macrophages for treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC). siRNA loaded GTC NPs were prepared based on ionic gelation of GTC with anionic crosslinkers (tripolyphosphate (TPP) or hyaluronic acid (HA)). The types of crosslinkers involved in GTC NPs significantly affected their physicochemical characteristics. GTC/TPP NPs with smaller particle size and lower zeta potential possessed superior structural stability in gastrointestinal environment compared to GTC/HA NPs. Cellular uptake of GTC/TPP NPs in activated macrophages was significantly enhanced compared to trimethyl chitosan-cysteine (TC)/TPP NPs owing to galactose receptor-mediated endocytosis. The in&nbsp;vitro and in&nbsp;vivo gene knockdown measurement showed that siMap4k4 loaded GTC/TPP NPs effectively inhibited TNF-α production, which remarkably outperformed siMap4k4 loaded TC/TPP NPs. Compared to TC/TPP NPs, GTC/TPP NPs more efficiently promoted the distribution of siRNA in ulcerative colon following oral administration. Daily oral administration of GTC/TPP NPs containing siMap4k4 significantly improved DSS-induced body weight loss, colon length shortening, and increase of myeloperoxidase activity. This study would provide an effective approach for oral siRNA delivery in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
differentiation into mature myotubes is a critical step in the development and repair of human skeletal muscle. Here we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based silencing of the Ste20-like mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (Map4k4) in C2C12 myoblasts markedly enhances expression of myogenic differentiation genes, myoblast fusion, and myotube diameter. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated expression of native Map4k4 in C2C12 cells attenuates each of these processes, indicating that Map4k4 is a negative regulator of myogenic differentiation and hypertrophy. Expression of a Map4k4 kinase-inactive mutant enhances myotube formation, suggesting that the kinase activity of Map4k4 is essential for its inhibition of muscle differentiation. Map4k4 regulation of myogenesis is unlikely to be mediated by classic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, because no significant difference in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is observed in Map4k4-silenced cells. Furthermore, silencing of these other MAPKs does not result in a hypertrophic myotube phenotype like that seen with Map4k4 depletion. Uniquely, Map4k4 silencing upregulates the expression of the myogenic regulatory factor Myf5, whose depletion inhibits myogenesis. Furthermore, Myf5 is required for enhancement of myotube formation in Map4k4-silenced cells, while Myf5 overexpression rescues Map4k4-mediated inhibition of myogenic differentiation. These results demonstrate that Map4k4 is a novel suppressor of skeletal muscle differentiation, acting through a Myf5-dependent mechanis.
ctivated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is expressed in all diabetes-relevant tissues and mediates cytokine-induced insulin resistance. We investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAP4K4 locus associate with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, impaired insulin release, or elevated plasma cytokines. The best hit was tested for association with type 2 diabetes. Subjects (N = 1,769) were recruited from the Tübingen Family (TÜF) study for type 2 diabetes and genotyped for tagging SNPs. In a subgroup, cytokines were measured. Association with type 2 diabetes was tested in a prospective case-cohort study (N = 2,971) derived from the EPIC-Potsdam study. Three SNPs (rs6543087, rs17801985, rs1003376) revealed nominal and two SNPs (rs11674694, rs11678405) significant associations with 2-hour glucose levels. SNPs rs6543087 and rs11674694 were also nominally associated with decreased insulin sensitivity. Another two SNPs (rs2236936, rs2236935) showed associations with reduced insulin release, driven by effects in lean subjects only. Three SNPs (rs11674694, rs13003883, rs2236936) revealed nominal associations with IL-6 levels. SNP rs11674694 was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, common variation in MAP4K4 is associated with insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, possibly via this gene's role in inflammatory signalling. This variation's impact on insulin sensitivity may be more important since its effect on insulin release vanishes with increasing BM.
ing evidence indicates that mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is frequently overexpressed in many types of human cancers, and plays important roles in transformation, invasiveness, adhesion, and cell migration. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression and prognostic significance of MAP4K4 in lung adenocarcinoma. The results of real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed an enhanced expression of MAP4K4 in lung adenocarcinomas relative to adjacent non-tumorous lung tissues at both transcriptional and translational levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that 130 of 309 (42%) lung adenocarcinomas had high expression of MAP4K4. MAP4K4 overexpression was significantly correlated with histological grade (p=0.027), pT status (p=0.048), pN status (p=0.006), and pleural invasion (p=0.024). Patients with high MAP4K4 expression had a shorter overall survival compared with those with low MAP4K4 expression, regardless of histological grade, pT status, pN status, or pleural invasion status. Multivariate analysis identified MAP4K4 as an independent prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that elevated MAP4K4 expression is closely associated with lung adenocarcinoma progression and has an independent prognostic value in predicting overall survival for patients with lung adenocarcinom.
 (miRNAs) represent small noncoding RNAs that play a role in many diseases, including diabetes. miRNAs target genes important for pancreas development, β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and exocytosis. Previously, we documented that microRNA-30d (miR-30d), one of miRNAs up-regulated by glucose, induces insulin gene expression in pancreatic β-cells. Here, we found that the induction of insulin production by overexpression of miR-30d is associated with increased expression of MafA, a β-cell-specific transcription factor. Of interest, overexpression of miR-30d prevented the reduction in both MafA and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) with TNF-α exposure. Moreover, we identified that mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (MAP4K4), a TNF-α-activated kinase, is a direct target of miR-30d. Overexpression of miR-30d protected β-cells against TNF-α suppression on both insulin transcription and insulin secretion through the down-regulation of MAP4K4 by the miR-30d. A decrease of miR-30d expression was observed in the islets of diabetic db/db mice, in which MAP4K4 expression level was elevated. Our data support the notion that miR-30d plays multiple roles in activating insulin transcription and protecting β-cell functions from impaired by proinflammatory cytokines and underscore the concept that miR-30d may represent a novel pharmacological target for diabetes interventio.
ctivated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) is overexpressed in many types of cancer. Herein, we aimed to investigate its expression pattern, clinical significance, and biological function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC.
pression was examined in 20 fresh HCCs and corresponding nontumor liver tissues. Immunohistochemistry for MAP4K4 was performed on additional 400 HCCs, of which 305 (76%) were positive for hepatitis B surface antigens. The clinical significance of MAP4K4 expression was analyzed. MAP4K4 downregulation was performed in HCC cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B with high abundance of MAP4K4, and the effects of MAP4K4 silencing on cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were evaluated. Quantitative real-time PCR arrays were employed to identify the MAP4K4-regulated signaling pathway.
s aberrantly overexpressed in HCCs relative to adjacent nontumor liver tissues. This overexpression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, increased histologic grade, advanced tumor stage, and intrahepatic metastasis, as well as worse overall survival and higher early recurrence rate. Knockdown of the MAP4K4 expression reduced cell proliferation, blocked cell cycle at S phase, and increased apoptosis. The antitumor effects of MAP4K4 silencing were also observed in vivo, manifested as retarded tumor xenograft growth. Furthermore, multiple tumor progression-related signaling pathways including JNK, NFκB, and toll-like receptors were repressed by MAP4K4 downregulatio.
erexpression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis of HCC patients, and inhibition of its expression might be of therapeutic significanc.
nd type 2 diabetes present partially overlapping phenotypes with systemic inflammation as a common feature, raising the hypothesis that elevated cytokine levels may contribute to peripheral insulin resistance as well as the decreased beta cell functional mass observed in type 2 diabetes. In healthy humans, TNF-alpha infusion induces skeletal muscle insulin resistance. We now explore the impact of TNF-alpha on primary beta cell function and the underlying signaling pathways. Human and rat primary beta cells were sorted by FACS and cultured for 24 h +/- 20 ng/ml TNF-alpha to explore the impact on apoptosis, proliferation, and short-term insulin secretion (1 h, 2.8 mm glucose followed by 1 h, 16.7 mm glucose at the end of the 24-h culture period) as well as key signaling protein phosphorylation and expression. Prior exposure to TNF-alpha for 24 h inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from primary beta cells. This is associated with a decrease in glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of key proteins in the insulin signaling pathway including Akt, AS160, and other Akt substrates, ERK as well as the insulin receptor. Strikingly, TNF-alpha treatment decreased IRS-2 protein level by 46 +/- 7% versus control, although mRNA expression was unchanged. While TNF-alpha treatment increased MAP4K4 mRNA expression by 33 +/- 5%, knockdown of MAP4K4 by siRNA-protected beta cells against the detrimental effects of TNF-alpha on both insulin secretion and signaling. We thus identify MAP4K4 as a key upstream mediator of TNF-alpha action on the beta cell, making it a potential therapeutic target for preservation of beta cell function in type 2 diabete.
ncing by double-stranded RNA, denoted RNA interference, represents a new paradigm for rational drug design. However, the transformative therapeutic potential of short interfering RNA (siRNA) has been stymied by a key obstacle-safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo. Macrophages are particularly attractive targets for RNA interference therapy because they promote pathogenic inflammatory responses in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. Here we report the engineering of beta1,3-D-glucan-encapsulated siRNA particles (GeRPs) as efficient oral delivery vehicles that potently silence genes in mouse macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Oral gavage of mice with GeRPs containing as little as 20 microg kg(-1) siRNA directed against tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-alpha) depleted its messenger RNA in macrophages recovered from the peritoneum, spleen, liver and lung, and lowered serum Tnf-alpha levels. Screening with GeRPs for inflammation genes revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (Map4k4) is a previously unknown mediator of cytokine expression. Importantly, silencing Map4k4 in macrophages in vivo protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality by inhibiting Tnf-alpha and interleukin-1beta production. This technology defines a new strategy for oral delivery of siRNA to attenuate inflammatory responses in human diseas.
ed preadipocyte differentiation in obese and nonobese individuals and the effect of cytokines and wingless-type MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus) integration site family, member 3A (Wnt3a) protein on preadipocyte differentiation and phenotyp.
 subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from a total of 51 donors with varying BMI. After isolation of the adipose and stromalvascular cells, inflammatory cells (CD14- and CD45-positive cells) were removed by immune magnetic separation. CD133-positive cells, containing early progenitor cells, were also isolated and quantified. The CD14- and CD45-negative preadipocytes were cultured with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, resistin, or Wnt3a with or without a differentiation cocktai.
r of preadipocytes able to differentiate to adipose cells was negatively correlated with both BMI and adipocyte cell size of the donors, whereas the number of CD133-positive cells was positively correlated with BMI, suggesting an impaired differentiation of preadipocytes in obesity. Cultured preadipocytes, like freshly isolated mature adipocytes, from obese individuals had an increased expression of mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (MAP4K4), which is known to inhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma induction. TNF-alpha, but not IL-6 or resistin, increased Wnt10b, completely inhibited the normal differentiation of the preadipocytes, and instead induced a proinflammatory and macrophage-like phenotype of the cell.
ent number of preadipocytes in the abdominal subcutaneous tissue that can undergo differentiation is reduced in obesity with enlarged fat cells, possibly because of increased MAP4K4 levels. TNF-alpha promoted a macrophage-like phenotype of the preadipocytes, including several macrophage markers. These results document the plasticity of human preadipocytes and the inverse relationship between lipid storage and proinflammatory capacit.
e activity is a crucial cell-autonomous factor supporting tumor initiation and progression. To decipher pathways impacted by Ral, we have generated null and hypomorph alleles of the Drosophila melanogaster Ral gene. Ral null animals were not viable. Reduced Ral expression in cells of the sensory organ lineage had no effect on cell division but led to postmitotic cell-specific apoptosis. Genetic epistasis and immunofluorescence in differentiating sensory organs suggested that Ral activity suppresses c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and induces p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. HPK1/GCK-like kinase (HGK), a MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase that can drive JNK activation, was found as an exocyst-associated protein in vivo. The exocyst is a Ral effector, and the epistasis between mutants of Ral and of msn, the fly ortholog of HGK, suggest the functional relevance of an exocyst/HGK interaction. Genetic analysis also showed that the exocyst is required for the execution of Ral function in apoptosis. We conclude that in Drosophila Ral counters apoptotic programs to support cell fate determination by acting as a negative regulator of JNK activity and a positive activator of p38 MAP kinase. We propose that the exocyst complex is Ral executioner in the JNK pathway and that a cascade from Ral to the exocyst to HGK would be a molecular basis of Ral action on JN.
lity is a complex biological process, involved in development, inflammation, homeostasis, and pathological processes such as the invasion and metastatic spread of cancer. Here, we describe a genomic screen designed to identify inhibitors of cell migration. A library of 10,996 small interfering RNAs (targeting 5,234 human genes) was screened for their ability to block the migration of a highly motile ovarian carcinoma cell line, SKOV-3, by using a 384-well wound-healing assay coupled with automated microscopy and wound quantification. Two or more small interfering RNAs against four genes, CDK7, DYRK1B, MAP4K4 (NIK/HGK) (MAP4K4, mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4), and SCCA-1 (SerpinB3), potently blocked the migration of SKOV-3 cells, concordant with reduced transcript levels. Further studies of the promigratory role of MAP4K4 showed that the knockdown of this transcript inhibited the migration of multiple carcinoma cell lines, indicating a broad role in cell motility and potently suppressed the invasion of SKOV-3 cells in vitro. The effect of MAP4K4 on cellular migration was found to be mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase, independent of AP1 activation and downstream transcription. Accordingly, small molecule inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase suppressed SKOV-3 cell migration, underscoring the potential therapeutic utility of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition in cancer progressio.
 serine/threonine kinase STE20 activates a signaling cascade that includes STE11 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase), STE7 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase), and FUS3/KSS1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) in response to signals from both Cdc42 and the heterotrimeric G proteins associated with transmembrane pheromone receptors. Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction, we have isolated a human cDNA encoding a protein kinase homologous to STE20. This protein kinase, designated HPK/GCK-like kinase (HGK), has nucleotide sequences that encode an open reading frame of 1165 amino acids with 11 kinase subdomains. HGK was a serine/threonine protein kinase that specifically activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway when transfected into 293T cells, but it did not stimulate either the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 kinase pathway. HGK also increased AP-1-mediated transcriptional activity in vivo. HGK-induced JNK activation was inhibited by the dominant-negative MKK4 and MKK7 mutants. The dominant-negative mutant of TAK1, but not MEKK1 or MAPK upstream kinase (MUK), strongly inhibited HGK-induced JNK activation. TNF-alpha activated HGK in 293T cells, as well as the dominant-negative HGK mutants, inhibited TNF-alpha-induced JNK activation. These results indicate that HGK, a novel activator of the JNK pathway, may function through TAK1, and that the HGK --&gt; TAK1 --&gt; MKK4, MKK7 --&gt; JNK kinase cascade may mediate the TNF-alpha signaling pathwa.
matory cytokines play important roles in insulin resistance. Here we report that mice with a T-cell-specific conditional knockout of HGK (T-HGK cKO) develop systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This condition is ameliorated by either IL-6 or IL-17 neutralization. HGK directly phosphorylates TRAF2, leading to its lysosomal degradation and subsequent inhibition of IL-6 production. IL-6-overproducing HGK-deficient T cells accumulate in adipose tissue and further differentiate into IL-6/IL-17 double-positive cells. Moreover, CCL20 neutralization or CCR6 deficiency reduces the Th17 population or insulin resistance in T-HGK cKO mice. In addition, leptin receptor deficiency in T cells inhibits Th17 differentiation and improves the insulin sensitivity in T-HGK cKO mice, which suggests that leptin cooperates with IL-6 to promote Th17 differentiation. Thus, HGK deficiency induces TRAF2/IL-6 upregulation, leading to IL-6/leptin-induced Th17 differentiation in adipose tissue and subsequent insulin resistance. These findings provide insight into the reciprocal regulation between the immune system and the metabolis.
ic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease, characterized by motor neuron (MN) death, for which there are no truly effective treatments. Here, we describe a new small molecule survival screen carried out using MNs from both wild-type and mutant SOD1 mouse embryonic stem cells. Among the hits we found, kenpaullone had a particularly impressive ability to prolong the healthy survival of both types of MNs that can be attributed to its dual inhibition of GSK-3 and HGK kinases. Furthermore, kenpaullone also strongly improved the survival of human MNs derived from ALS-patient-induced pluripotent stem cells and was more active than either of two compounds, olesoxime and dexpramipexole, that recently failed in ALS clinical trials. Our studies demonstrate the value of a stem cell approach to drug discovery and point to a new paradigm for identification and preclinical testing of future ALS therapeutic.
igate the effects of RNA interference targeting hepatocyte progenitor kinase-like kinase (HGK) in the invasion and adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line HepG.
red insert DNA fragments specific to HGK gene and one negative control DNA fragment were synthesized and inserted into RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ-ZsGreen vector. Western blotting assay and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to screen the vector with a highest inhibitory rate. The vector was used to generate recombinant retrovirus specific to HGK. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to examine cell growth; wound closure assay and cell adhesion assay were employed to investigate cell migration and adhesion respectively; and transwell assay and three-dimensional culture invasion assay were used to detect cell invasion. The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB were detected by Western blotting assa.
time RT-PCR and Western blotting assay showed that cells transfected with retrovirus mediating RNAi targeting of HGK (RV-shHGK)-1 vector had the strongest inhibition of HGK protein, with an inhibition rate of 76%, and this vector was used to generate recombinant retrovirus RV-shHGK-1. Cell adhesion assay and MTT assay found that cell adhesion and growth of the cells infected with RV-shHGK-1 were significantly lower than those of the control cells (P &lt; 0.05). Wound closure assay, transwell assay and three-dimensional culture invasion assay showed that the cell invasiveness was significantly less in HGK knockdown cells than in the control cells (P &lt; 0.05). The expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9 and NF-κB were inhibited in HepG2 cells infected with RV-shHGK-.
lation of HGK can obviously inhibit the migration and invasion of HepG2 cells in vitro. HGK may be a new therapeutic target for treatment of HC.
ive activation of RhoA-dependent RhoA kinase (ROCK) signalling is known to promote cellular transformation and the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 has the ability to suppress focus formation of RhoA transformed NIH3T3 cell.
r novel structural analogues of Y27632 were synthesised and tested for their ability to persistently inhibit the transformation of NIH3T3 cells by Rho guanidine exchange factor 16 (ARHGEF16) or Ras. In vitro kinase inhibitor profiling, co-culture of transformed cells with non-transformed cells and a novel Lucifer yellow/PKH67 dye transfer method were used to investigate their mode of actio.
32 analogues inhibited transformed focus formation that persisted when the compound was withdrawn. No toxicity was observed against either transformed or non-transformed cells and the effect was dependent on co-culture of these two cell types. In vitro kinase inhibitor profiling indicated that these compounds had reduced activity against ROCK compared with Y27632, targeting instead Aurora A (AURKA), p38 (MAPK14) and Hgk (MAP4K4). Dye transfer analysis showed they increased gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between transformed and non-transformed cell.
a are the first to suggest that transient blockade of specific kinases can induce a persistent inhibition of non-contact inhibited transformed colony formation and can also remove pre-formed colonies. These effects could potentially be mediated by the observed increase in GJIC between transformed and non-transformed cells. Selection of kinase inhibitors with this property may thus provide a novel strategy for cancer chemopreventio.
tocyte progenitor kinase-like/germinal center kinase-like kinase) is a member of the human STE20/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase family of serine/threonine kinases and is the ortholog of mouse NIK (Nck-interacting kinase). We have cloned a novel splice variant of HGK from a human tumor line and have further identified a complex family of HGK splice variants. We showed HGK to be highly expressed in most tumor cell lines relative to normal tissue. An active role for this kinase in transformation was suggested by an inhibition of H-Ras(V12)-induced focus formation by expression of inactive, dominant-negative mutants of HGK in both fibroblast and epithelial cell lines. Expression of an inactive mutant of HGK also inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of cells yet had no effect on proliferation in monolayer culture. Expression of HGK mutants modulated integrin receptor expression and had a striking effect on hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated epithelial cell invasion. Together, these results suggest an important role for HGK in cell transformation and invasivenes.
uman guanylate-binding protein (GBP) hGBP3 was identified and characterized. Similar as the two human guanylate-binding proteins hGBP1 and hGBP2, hGBP3 has the first two motifs of the three classical guanylate-binding motifs, GXXXXGKS (T) and DXXG, but lacks the N (T) KXD motif. Escherichia coli-expressed hGBP3 protein specifically binds to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Using a yeast two-hybrid system, it was revealed that the N-terminal region of hGBP3 binds to the C-terminal regulatory domain of NIK/HGK, a member of the group I GCK (germinal center kinase) family. This interaction was confirmed by in vitro glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assay.
rosis factor superfamily ligands and receptors are responsible for development, immunity, and homeostasis of metazoan organisms. Thus, it is not surprising that signals emanating from these receptors are tightly regulated. Binding of TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) to its cognate receptor, FN14, triggers the assembly of receptor-associated signaling complex, which allows the activation of canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Ubiquitin ligases cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2 (c-IAP1 and 2) and adaptor proteins TNFR-associated factors 2 and 3 (TRAF2 and TRAF3) are crucial for the regulation of TWEAK signaling as they facilitate the recruitment of distal signaling components including IKK and linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex complexes. At the same time c-IAP1/2, together with TRAF2 and TRAF3, promote constitutive ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) - a kinase with critical role in the activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling. While c-IAP1/2 mediated ubiquitination allows the activation of TWEAK-stimulated canonical NF-κB signaling, these E3 ligases are negative regulators of non-canonical signaling. TWEAK stimulation prompts the recruitment of c-IAP1/2 as well as TRAF2 and TRAF3 to the FN14 signaling complex leading to c-IAP1/2 autoubiquitination and degradation, which stabilizes NIK and allows subsequent phosphorylation of IKKα and partial proteasomal processing of p100 to activate gene expression. Recent studies have revealed that the spatio-temporal pattern of TWEAK-stimulated ubiquitination is a carefully orchestrated process involving several substrates that are modified by different ubiquitin linkages. Understanding the significance of ubiquitination for TWEAK signaling is important for the overall understanding of TWEAK biology and for the design of therapeutics that can be used in the treatment of human pathologies that are driven by TWEAK/FN14 expression and activit.
oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion radical or hydroxyl radical, play an important role in inflammation processes as well as in transduction of signals from receptors to interleukin -1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS). NADPH oxidase increases the ROS levels, leading to inactivation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP): MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). Inactivation of phosphatases results in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), which, in turn, activate cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (cPLA₂). ROS cause cytoplasmic calcium influx by activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphorylation of IP₃-sensitive calcium channels. ROS activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) via IκB kinase (IKK) through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) or NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). IKK phosphorylates NF-κB α subunit (IκBα) at Ser³². Oxidative stress inactivates NIK and IκB kinase γ subunit/NF-κB essential modulator (IKKγ/NEMO), which might cause activation of NF-κB that is independent on IKK and inhibitor of IκBα degradation, including phosphorylation of Tyr⁴² at IκBα by c-Src and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), phosphorylation of the domain rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine and threonine (PEST) sequence by casein kinase II and inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). NF-κB and MAPK cascades-activated transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) and CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300) lead to expression of cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (cPLA₂), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES-1), and thus to increased release of arachidonic acid and production of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). ROS increase the activity of hematopoietic-type PGD synthase (H-PGDS), and, as a result, the production of prostaglandin D₂ (PGD₂). However, the superoxide radical reacts with nitric oxide forming peroxynitrite that inactivates prostaglandin I synthase (PGIS), suppressing the production of prostaglandin I₂ (PGI₂). ROS do not affect thromboxane synthesis in a direct manner; this is achieved by an increase in cPLA₂ activity and COX-2 expression. The aim of this review was to summarize knowledge of influence of ROS on the synthesis of prostanoids from arachidonic aci.
 immune signal (CD14-TLR and TNF) in leishmaniasis can be linked to EGFR pathway involved in wound healing, through crosstalk points. This signaling network can be further linked to a synthetic gene circuit acting as a positive feedback loop to elicit a synchronized intercellular communication among the immune cells which may contribute to a better understanding of signaling dynamics in leishmaniasi.
econstruction with positive feedback loop, simulation (ODE 15s solver) and sensitivity analysis of CD14-TLR, TNF and EGFR was done in SimBiology (MATLAB 7.11.1). Cytoscape and adjacency matrix were used to calculate network topology. PCA was extracted by using sensitivity coefficient in MATLAB. Model reduction was done using time, flux and sensitivity scor.
as five crosstalk points: NIK, IκB-NFκB and MKK (4/7, 3/6, 1/2) which show high flux and sensitivity. PI3K in EGFR pathway shows high flux and sensitivity. PCA score was high for cytoplasmic ERK1/2, PI3K, Atk, STAT1/3 and nuclear JNK. Of the 125 parameters, 20% are crucial as deduced by model reductio.
be linked to CD14-TLR and TNF through the MAPK crosstalk points. These pathways may be controlled through Ras and Raf that lie upstream of signaling components ERK ½ (c) and JNK (n) that have a high PCA score via a synthetic gene circuit for activating cell-cell communication to elicit an inflammatory response. Also a disease resolving effect may be achieved through PI3K in the EGFR pathwa.
structed signaling network can be linked to a gene circuit with a positive feedback loop, for cell-cell communication resulting in synchronized response in the immune cell population, for disease resolving effect in leishmaniasi.
ctivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays an important role in response to viral infection. The aim of this study was to explore the function and mechanism of MAPK signaling pathway in enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection of human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell.
 of RD cells was observed using annexin V-FITC/PI binding assay under a fluorescence microscope. Cellular RNA was extracted and transcribed to cDNA. The expressions of 56 genes of MAPK signaling pathway in EV71-infected RD cells at 8h and 20h after infection were analyzed by PCR array. The levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α in the supernatant of RD cells infected with EV71 at different time points were measured by ELIS.
lity of RD cells decreased obviously within 48h after EV71 infection. Compared with the control group, EV71 infection resulted in the significantly enhanced releases of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-α from infected RD cells (p&lt;0.05). At 8h after infection, the expressions of c-Jun, c-Fos, IFN-β, MEKK1, MLK3 and NIK genes in EV71-infected RD cells were up-regulated by 2.08-6.12-fold, whereas other 19 genes (e.g. AKT1, AKT2, E2F1, IKK and NF-κB1) exhibited down-regulation. However, at 20h after infection, those MAPK signaling molecules including MEKK1, ASK1, MLK2, MLK3, NIK, MEK1, MEK2, MEK4, MEK7, ERK1, JNK1 and JNK2 were up-regulated. In addition, the expressions of AKT2, ELK1, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB p65, PI3K and STAT1 were also increase.
ction induces the differential gene expressions of MAPK signaling pathway such as ERK, JNK and PI3K/AKT in RD cells, which may be associated with the secretions of inflammatory cytokines and host cell apoptosi.
l, one of the phytoestrogens, is found in berries and Brassica and Allium species and is known to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammation effect of kaempferol in an aged animal model. To examine the effect of kaempferol in aged Sprague-Dawley rats, kaempferol was fed at 2 or 4 mg/kg/day for 10 days. The data show that kaempferol exhibited the ability to maintain redox balance. Kaempferol suppressed nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and expression of its target genes cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and regulated upon activation, and normal T-cell expressed and secreted in aged rat kidney and in tert-butylhydroperoxide-induced YPEN-1 cells. Furthermore, kaempferol suppressed the increase of the pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB cascade through modulation of nuclear factor-inducing kinase (NIK)/IkappaB kinase (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in aged rat kidney. Based on these results, we concluded that anti-oxidative kaempferol suppressed the activation of inflammatory NF-kappaB transcription factor through NIK/IKK and MAPKs in aged rat kidne.
exerts apoptosis throughout an intracellular transduction pathway that involves the kinase proteins TRAF-2 (integration point of apoptotic and survival signals), ASK1 (pro-apoptotic protein), MEK-4 (p38 activator and metastasis suppressor gene), JNK (stress mitogen activated protein kinase) and the transcription factor AP-1. TNFalpha also exerts proliferation by p38 activation, or when TRAF-2 simultaneously induces the transcription factor NF-kappaB by NIK. NIK and p38 may also be activated by IL-1. P38 activated several transcription factors such as Elk-1, ATF-2 and NF-kappaB. NIK also may activate NF-kappaB. The aim of the present article was to evaluate the different components of this TNFalpha/IL-1 transduction pathway in human prostate carcinoma (PC) in comparison with normal human prostate. In prostate cancer, pro-apoptotic TNFalpha/AP-1 pathway is probably inactivated by different factors such as p21 (at ASK-1 level) and bcl-2 (at JNK level), or diverted towards p38 or NIK activation. IL-1alpha enhances proliferation through IL-1RI that activates either NIK or p38 transduction pathway. P38 and NIK activate different transcription factors related with cell proliferation and survival such as ATF-2, Elk-1 or NF-kappaB. In order to search a possible target to cancer prostate treatment we proposed that inhibition of several proinflamatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNFalpha might be a possible target for PC treatment, because decrease the activity of all transduction pathway members that activate transcription factors as NF-kappaB, Elk-1 or ATF-.
oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the regulation of NF-kappaB activation, which plays an important role in inflammation and cell survival. However, the molecular mechanisms of ROS in NF-kappaB activation remain poorly defined. We found that the non-provitamin A carotenoid, lutein, decreased intracellular H(2)O(2) accumulation by scavenging superoxide and H(2)O(2) and the NF-kappaB-regulated inflammatory genes, iNOS, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and cyclooxygenase-2, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Lutein inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation, which highly correlated with its inhibitory effect on LPS-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation, IkappaB degradation, nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to the kappaB motif of the iNOS promoter. This compound inhibited LPS- and H(2)O(2)-induced increases in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, PTEN inactivation, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), and Akt phosphorylation, which are all upstream of IKK activation, but did not affect the interaction between Toll-like receptor 4 and MyD88 and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and gp91(phox) deletion reduced the LPS-induced NF-kappaB signaling pathway as lutein did. Moreover, lutein treatment and gp91(phox) deletion decreased the expressional levels of the inflammatory genes in vivo and protected mice from LPS-induced lethality. Our data suggest that H(2)O(2) modulates IKK-dependent NF-kappaB activation by promoting the redox-sensitive activation of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt and NIK/IKK pathways. These findings further provide new insights into the pathophysiological role of intracellular H(2)O(2) in the NF-kappaB signal pathway and inflammatory proces.
ed the role of osteopontin (OPN) in NIK- and MEKK1-dependent MMP-9 activation, melanoma growth and lung metastasis and its clinical significance in malignant melanoma. Here we report that OPN induces alphavbeta3 integrin-mediated MEKK1-dependent JNK1 phosphorylation. OPN stimulates NIK- or JNK1-dependent c-Jun expression. In contrast, OPN induces MEKK1-dependent JNK1 activation that leads to downregulation of ERK1/2 activation. OPN triggers NIK- and MEKK1-dependent AP-1 activation whereas NIK-dependent AP-1 activation is independent of JNK1 that leads to pro-MMP-9 activation. In vivo studies indicate that the levels of pNIK and MMP-9 are significantly higher in the OPN-induced primary tumor and metastasized lung compared to control. Clinical data revealed that the enhanced level of OPN and pNIK expression in the skin biopsies correlates with Clark's level and Breslow thickness. Altogether, OPN regulates negative cross-talk between NIK/ERK and MEKK1/JNK1 pathways that controls melanoma progressio.
se 4 (MKK4) is a dual-specificity kinase that activates both JNK and p38 MAPK. However, the mechanism by which MKK4 regulates TNF-induced apoptosis is not fully understood. Therefore, we used fibroblasts derived from MKK4 gene-deleted (MKK4-KO) mice to determine the role of this kinase in TNF signaling. We found that when compared with the wild-type cells, deletion of MKK4 gene enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis, and this correlated with down-regulation of TNF-induced cell-proliferative (COX-2 and cyclin D1) and antiapoptotic (survivin, IAP1, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and cFLIP) gene products, all regulated by NF-kappaB. Indeed we found that TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation was abrogated in MKK4 gene-deleted cells, as determined by DNA binding. Further investigation revealed that TNF-induced I kappaB alpha kinase activation, I kappaB alpha phosphorylation, I kappaB alpha degradation, and p65 nuclear translocation were all suppressed in MKK4-KO cells. NF-kappaB reporter assay revealed that NF-kappaB activation induced by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and I kappaB alpha kinase was modulated in gene-deleted cells. Overall, our results indicate that MKK4 plays a central role in TNF-induced apoptosis through the regulation of NF-kappaB-regulated gene product.
butein (3,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-fibrogenic activities, very little is known about its mechanism of action. Because numerous effects modulated by butein can be linked to interference with the NF-kappaB pathway, we investigated in detail the effect of this chalcone on NF-kappaB activity. As examined by DNA binding, we found that butein suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-kappaB activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner; suppressed the NF-kappaB activation induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens; and inhibited the NF-kappaB reporter activity induced by TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, TAK1/TAB1, and IKK-beta. We also found that butein blocked the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha by inhibiting IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) activation. We found the inactivation of IKK by butein was direct and involved cysteine residue 179. This correlated with the suppression of phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of p65. In this study, butein also inhibited the expression of the NF-kappaB-regulated gene products involved in anti-apoptosis (IAP2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and invasion (COX-2 and MMP-9). Suppression of these gene products correlated with enhancement of the apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents; and inhibition of cytokine-induced cellular invasion. Overall, our results indicated that antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities previously assigned to butein may be mediated in part through the direct inhibition of IKK, leading to the suppression of the NF-kappaB activation pathwa.
nent systems, consisting of proteins with histidine kinase and/or response regulator domains, regulate environmental responses in bacteria, Archaea, fungi, slime molds, and plants. Here, we characterize RRG-1, a response regulator protein from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The cell lysis phenotype of Delta rrg-1 mutants is reminiscent of osmotic-sensitive (os) mutants, including nik-1/os-1 (a histidine kinase) and strains defective in components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: os-4 (MAPK kinase kinase), os-5 (MAPK kinase), and os-2 (MAPK). Similar to os mutants, Delta rrg-1 strains are sensitive to hyperosmotic conditions, and they are resistant to the fungicides fludioxonil and iprodione. Like os-5, os-4, and os-2 mutants, but in contrast to nik-1/os-1 strains, Delta rrg-1 mutants do not produce female reproductive structures (protoperithecia) when nitrogen starved. OS-2-phosphate levels are elevated in wild-type cells exposed to NaCl or fludioxonil, but they are nearly undetectable in Delta rrg-1 strains. OS-2-phosphate levels are also low in Delta rrg-1, os-2, and os-4 mutants under nitrogen starvation. Analysis of the rrg-1(D921N) allele, mutated in the predicted phosphorylation site, provides support for phosphorylation-dependent and -independent functions for RRG-1. The data indicate that RRG-1 controls vegetative cell integrity, hyperosmotic sensitivity, fungicide resistance, and protoperithecial development through regulation of the OS-4/OS-5/OS-2 MAPK pathwa.
ry objective of this study was to evaluate the ability and mechanism of action of kaempferol, which is contained in extracts from Nelumbo nucifera, a well-known Oriental herb used in traditional medicine, with regard to the inhibition of iNOS and TNF-alpha expression in aged rat gingival tissues. We conducted an investigation into the age-related effects of kaempferol on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GSH oxidative status in samples of aged gingival tissues. Western blotting was conducted in order to determine the expression of iNOS, TNF-alpha, p38 MAPK, NIK/IKK, p65 and IkappaBalpha in the sample tissues. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were conducted in an effort to characterize the binding activities of NF-kappaB transcription factors in the aged rat gingival nuclear extracts. Our results indicate that kaempferol reduced ROS levels and augmented GSH levels in a dose-dependent manner in the aged gingival tissues. Kaempferol was shown to effect a significant reduction in iNOS and TNF-alpha protein levels, as compared to control gingival tissue samples. The results of Western blot analysis revealed that kaempferol treatment effected the reduction of iNOS and TNF-alpha expression, decreased nuclear p65 and increased cytosolic p65, down-regulation of Erk, p38, JNK and NIK/IKK expression. The EMSA results also indicated that kaempferol, when administered to the rat tissues, attenuated the NF-kappaB nuclear binding activity. Kaempferol may inhibit ROS generation via the inhibition of iNOS and TNF-alpha expression in aged gingival tissues, via the modulation of the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways, especially NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-mediated alternative pathway, in CD40-mediated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 productions by immature or mature dendritic cells (DCs) was investigated. Murine myeloid DCs were matured by treatment with lipopolysaccharide. CD40 ligation induced modest or vigorous cytokine productions in immature or mature DCs, respectively. After CD40 ligation, p38 MAPK was significantly activated in either immature or mature DCs. SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, markedly decreased CD40-mediated IL-6 and IL-12 productions in immature DCs. In mature DCs, SB203580 significantly decreased CD40-mediated IL-6 but not IL-12 production. On the other hand, CD40 ligation induced vigorous activation of the NF-kappaB alternative pathway including p100 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocations of p52, a processed form of p100, and RelB in mature but not immature DCs. The CD40-mediated phosphorylation of p100 was completely abolished in NIK-mutated mature DCs. The NIK mutation markedly reduced CD40-mediated IL-12 but not IL-6 production by mature DCs. Taken together, we concluded that IL-6 and IL-12 productions in response to CD40 ligation were controlled by p38 MAPK and NIK mediated alternative pathway, respectively, in mature DC.
in-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 is a key modulator of whole body glucose homeostasis, and its selective loss in adipose tissue or skeletal muscle causes insulin resistance and diabetes. Here we report an RNA interference-based screen of protein kinases expressed in adipocytes and identify four negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport: the protein kinases PCTAIRE-1 (PCTK1), PFTAIRE-1 (PFTK1), IkappaB kinase alpha, and MAP4K4/NIK. Integrin-linked protein kinase was identified as a positive regulator of this process. We characterized one of these hits, MAP4K4/NIK, and found that it is unique among mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases expressed in cultured adipocytes in attenuating hexose transport. Remarkably, MAP4K4/NIK suppresses expression of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, and PPARgamma and of GLUT4 itself in these cells. RNA interference-mediated depletion of MAP4K4/NIK early in differentiation enhances adipogenesis and triglyceride deposition, and even in fully differentiated adipocytes its loss up-regulates GLUT4. Conversely, conditions that inhibit adipogenesis such as TNF-alpha treatment or depletion of PPARgamma markedly up-regulate MAP4K4/NIK expression in cultured adipocytes. Furthermore, TNF-alpha signaling to down-regulate GLUT4 is impaired in the absence of MAP4K4/NIK, indicating that MAP4K4 expression is required for optimal TNF-alpha action. These results reveal a MAP4K4/NIK-dependent signaling pathway that potently inhibits PPARgamma-responsive gene expression, adipogenesis, and insulin-stimulated glucose transpor.
acting kinase-like embryo-specific kinase (NESK) is a protein kinase that is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle during the late stages of mouse embryogenesis. NESK belongs to the germinal center kinase (GCK) family and selectively activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway when overexpressed in cultured cells. Some members of the GCK family have been shown to be proteolytically cleaved and activated during apoptosis. Here, we report that NESK is also proteolytically cleaved during apoptosis. Treatment of NESK-transfected HeLa cells with TNF-alpha in the presence of cycloheximide or with staurosporine induced proteolytic cleavage of NESK. The cleavage of NESK occurred at two sites, generating three fragments: an N-terminal fragment containing a kinase domain, an intermediate fragment and a C-terminal fragment containing a regulatory CNH domain. These two cleavages occurred in a stepwise manner and were dependent on a caspase activity. The cleavage sites were identified as aspartic acid residues at 868 and 1091. The N-terminal fragment had less kinase activity than the full-length NESK and did not activate the JNK pathway. In contrast, the C-terminal fragment activated the JNK pathway more strongly than the full-length NESK and promoted TNF-alpha-induced apoptotic cell death. These results implicate NESK in the JNK pathway-mediated promotion of apoptosis through its C-terminal regulatory domain generated by proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis, in a unique manner different from other GCK family kinase.
/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) is a member of the germinal center family of kinases that are homologous to the yeast sterile 20 (Ste20) kinases and regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell morphology, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and survival. Here, we present the cloning and functional characterization of a novel human Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase beta (hMINK beta) that encodes a polypeptide of 1312 amino acids. hMINK beta is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues with at least five alternatively spliced isoforms. Similar to Nck interacting kinase (NIK) and Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK), hMINK beta moderately activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and associates with Nck via the intermediate domain in the yeast two-hybrid system and in a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. Interestingly, overexpression of the kinase domain deleted and kinase-inactive mutants of hMINK beta in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells enhanced cell spreading, actin stress fiber formation, and adhesion to extracellular matrix, as well as decreased cell motility and cell invasion. Furthermore, these mutants also promoted cell-cell adhesion in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells, evidenced with cell growth in clusters and increased membrane localization of beta-catenin, a multifunctional protein involved in E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Finally, hMINK beta protein was found to colocalize with the Golgi apparatus, implicating that hMINK beta might exert its functions, at least in part, through the modulation of intracellular protein transport. Taken together, these results suggest that hMINK beta plays an important role in cytoskeleton reorganization, cell adhesion, and cell motilit.
hexenal (HHE) is known to affect redox balance during aging, included are vascular dysfunctions. To better understand vascular abnormality through the molecular alterations resulting from HHE accumulation in aging processes, we set out to determine whether up-regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by HHE is mediated through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells. HHE induced NF-kappaB activation by inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) phosphorylation via the IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK) pathway. HHE increased the activity of p38 MAPK and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), but not c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, indicating that p38 MAPK and ERK are closely involved in HHE-induced NF-kappaB transactivation. Pretreatment with ERK inhibitor PD98059, and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, attenuated the induction of p65 translocation, IkappaB phosphorylation, and NF-kappaB luciferase activity. These findings strongly suggest that HHE induces NF-kappaB activation through IKK/NIK pathway and/or p38 MAPK and ERK activation associated with oxidative stress in endothelial cell.
ention by the dithiolethione analogue oltipraz (4-methyl-5-(2-pyrazinyl)-1,2-dithiole-3-thione) may occur through several mechanisms, among them stimulation of detoxication activity. The phase II detoxication enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1; EC 1.6.99.2) also known as quinone reductase (QR) is well established to undergo transcriptional activation following oltipraz treatment of colon cancer cells in culture. Promoter analysis of the QR gene in oltipraztreated cells reveals the involvement of both the AP-1 and NF-kappaB elements in the response. The emerging role of NF-kappaB in cell survival prompted a fuller analysis of effects of oltipraz on this pathway. Oltipraz treatment of both HCT116 and HT29 cells results in the induction of proteins involved in both pathways of NF-kappaB activation, including p65, IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). IkappaBalpha total protein levels were unchanged, but phosphorylation of the inhibitor was also induced in both lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis confirmed induction of protein binding to a consensus NF-kappaB element, and transcriptional activation was further confirmed using a reporter construct. Transcriptional activation of QR was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by dominant-negative NF-kappaB in both cell lines. The molecular mechanism that triggers IKK activation in response to oltipraz was also examined using inhibitory constructs of NIK and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3). We found that both MEKK3 and NIK exert effects on IKKalpha/beta activation, but through different pathways. Furthermore, the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) was found to interact strongly with MEKK3 during oltipraz-induced NF-kappaB signaling, implying a role for tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling in the action of oltipraz. These results implicate a novel signaling pathway for the action of oltipraz in QR gene regulatio.
ter pylori-infected gastric mucosa displays a conspicuous infiltration of mononuclear cells and neutrophils. RANTES (short for &quot;regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted&quot;) is a chemoattractant cytokine (chemokine) important in the infiltration of T lymphocytes and monocytes. RANTES may therefore contribute to the cellular infiltrate in the H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa. The aim of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanism responsible for H. pylori-mediated RANTES expression. We observed that gastric epithelial cells produced RANTES upon coculture with H. pylori. In addition, H. pylori induced RANTES mRNA expression and an increase in luciferase activity in cells which were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct derived from the RANTES promoter, in gastric epithelial cells, indicating that the induction of RANTES production occurred at the transcriptional level. Induction of RANTES was dependent on an intact cag pathogenicity island. Activation of the RANTES promoter by H. pylori occurred through the action of NF-kappa B. Transfection of kinase-deficient mutants of I kappa B kinase (IKK) and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase (NIK) inhibited H. pylori-mediated RANTES activation. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha- or interleukin-1/Toll-like receptor signaling molecules-such as mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1, MyD88, and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-did not play a role in RANTES activation by H. pylori. Collectively, H. pylori induced NF-kappa B activation through an intracellular signaling pathway that involved IKK and NIK, leading to RANTES gene transcription. RANTES induction by H. pylori may play an important role in gastric inflammatio.
ating activity of the Arp2/3 complex promotes the assembly of branched actin filaments that drive plasma membrane protrusion in migrating cells. Arp2/3 complex binding to nucleation-promoting factors of the WASP and WAVE families was previously thought to be sufficient to increase nucleating activity. However, phosphorylation of the Arp2 subunit was recently shown to be necessary for Arp2/3 complex activity. We show in mammary carcinoma cells that mutant Arp2 lacking phosphorylation assembled with endogenous subunits and dominantly suppressed actin filament assembly and membrane protrusion. We also report that Nck-interacting kinase (NIK), a MAP4K4, binds and directly phosphorylates the Arp2 subunit, which increases the nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex. In cells, NIK kinase activity was necessary for increased Arp2 phosphorylation and plasma membrane protrusion in response to epidermal growth factor. NIK is the first kinase shown to phosphorylate and increase the activity of the Arp2/3 complex, and our findings suggest that it integrates growth factor regulation of actin filament dynamic.
rtebrate gastrulation, an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is necessary for migration of mesoderm from the primitive streak. We demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase and a p38-interacting protein (p38IP) are critically required for downregulation of E-cadherin during gastrulation. In an ENU-mutagenesis screen we identified the droopy eye (drey) mutation, which affects splicing of p38IP. p38IP(drey) mutant embryos display incompletely penetrant defects in neural tube closure, eye development, and gastrulation. A stronger allele (p38IP(RRK)) exhibits gastrulation defects in which mesoderm migration is defective due to deficiency in E-cadherin protein downregulation in the primitive streak. We show that p38IP binds directly to p38 and is required for p38 activation in vivo. Moreover, both p38 and p38IP are required for E-cadherin downregulation during gastrulation. Finally, p38 regulates E-cadherin protein expression downstream from NCK-interacting kinase (NIK) and independently of the regulation of transcription by Fibroblast Growth Factor (Fgf) signaling and Snai.
ecently demonstrated that nuclear factor-inducing kinase (NIK) plays a crucial role in osteopontin (OPN)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase/I kappa B alpha kinase-dependent nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B)-mediated promatrix metalloproteinase-9 activation (Rangaswami, H., Bulbule, A., and Kundu, G. C. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 38921-38935). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which OPN regulates NIK/MEKK1-dependent activating protein-1 (AP-1)-mediated promatrix metalloproteinase-9 activation and whether JNK1 plays any role in regulating both these pathways that control the cell motility are not well defined. Here we report that OPN induces alpha v beta3 integrin-mediated MEKK1 phosphorylation and MEKK1-dependent JNK1 phosphorylation and activation. Overexpression of NIK enhances OPN-induced c-Jun expression, whereas overexpressed NIK had no role in OPN-induced JNK1 phosphorylation and activation. Sustained activation of JNK1 by overexpression of wild type but not kinase negative MEKK1 resulted in suppression of ERK1/2 activation. But this did not affect the OPN-induced NIK-dependent ERK1/2 activation. OPN stimulated both NIK and MEKK1-dependent c-Jun expression, leading to AP-1 activation, whereas NIK-dependent AP-1 activation is independent of JNK1. OPN also enhanced JNK1-dependent/independent AP-1-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion, uPA-dependent promatrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation, cell motility, and invasion. OPN stimulates tumor growth, and the levels of c-Jun, AP-1, urokinase type plasminogen activator, and MMP-9 were higher in OPN-induced tumor compared with control. To our knowledge this is first report that OPN induces NIK/MEKK1-mediated JNK1-dependent/independent AP-1-mediated pro-MMP-9 activation and regulates the negative crosstalk between NIK/ERK1/2 and MEKK1/JNK1 pathways that ultimately controls the cell motility, invasiveness, and tumor growt.
 are heterodimeric (alphabeta) transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands. Through interactions with molecular partners at cell junctions, they provide a connection between the ECM and the cytoskeleton and regulate many aspects of cell behavior. A number of integrin-associated molecules have been identified; however, in many cases, their function and role in the animal remain to be clarifie.
dentified the Nck-interacting kinase (NIK), a member of the STE20/germinal center kinase (GCK) family, as a partner for the beta1A integrin cytoplasmic domain. We find that NIK is expressed in the nervous system and other tissues in mouse embryos and colocalizes with actin and beta1 integrin in cellular protrusions in transfected cells. To demonstrate the functional significance of this interaction, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, since it has only one beta (PAT-3) integrin chain, two alpha (INA-1 and PAT-2) integrin chains, and a well-conserved NIK ortholog (MIG-15). Using three methods, we show that reducing mig-15 activity results in premature branching of commissures. A significant aggravation of this defect is observed when mig-15 activity is compromised in a weak ina-1 background. Neuronal-specific RNA interference against mig-15 or pat-3 leads to similar axonal defects, thus showing that both mig-15 and pat-3 act cell autonomously in neurons. Finally, we show a genetic interaction between mig-15, ina-1, and genes that encode Rac GTPase.
eral models, we provide the first evidence that the kinase NIK and integrins interact in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is required for proper axonal navigation in C. elegan.
reviously shown that the Drosophila Ste20 kinase encoded by misshapen (msn) is an essential gene in Drosophila development. msn function is required to activate the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), basket (Bsk), to promote dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. Later in development, msn expression is required in photoreceptors in order for their axons to project normally. A mammalian homolog of msn, the NCK-interacting kinase (NIK) (recently renamed to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4; Map4k4), has been shown to activate JNK and to bind the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter NCK. To determine whether NIK also plays an essential role in mammalian development, we created mice deficient in NIK by homologous recombination at the Nik gene. Nik(-/-) mice die postgastrulation between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5. The most striking phenotype in Nik(-/-) embryos is the failure of mesodermal and endodermal cells that arise from the anterior end of the primitive streak (PS) to migrate to their correct location. As a result Nik(-/- )embryos fail to develop somites or a hindgut and are truncated posteriorly. Interestingly, chimeric analysis demonstrated that NIK has a cell nonautonomous function in stimulating migration of presomitic mesodermal cells away from the PS and a second cell autonomous function in stimulating the differentiation of presomitic mesoderm into dermomyotome. These findings indicate that despite the large number of Ste20 kinases in mammalian cells, members of this family play essential nonredundant function in regulating specific signaling pathways. In addition, these studies provide evidence that the signaling pathways regulated by these kinases are diverse and not limited to the activation of JNK because mesodermal and somite development are not perturbed in JNK1-, and JNK2-deficient mic.
 tolerance protects the host by limiting excessive 'cytokine storm' during sepsis, but compromises the ability to counteract infections in septic shock survivors. It reprograms Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 responses by attenuating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines without suppressing anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, but the mechanisms of reprogramming remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the induction of endotoxin tolerance in human monocytes, THP-1 and MonoMac-6 cells inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated phosphorylation of Lyn, c-Src and their recruitment to TLR4, but increased total protein phosphatase (PP) activity and the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B, PP2A, PTP nonreceptor type (PTPN) 22 and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1. Chemical PP inhibitors, okadaic acid, dephostatin and cantharidic acid markedly decreased or completely abolished LPS tolerance, indicating the importance of phosphatases in endotoxin tolerization. Overexpression of PTPN22 decreased LPS-mediated nuclear factor (NF)-x03BA;B activation, p38 phosphorylation and CXCL8 gene expression, while PTPN22 ablation upregulated LPS-induced p65 NF-x03BA;B and p38 phosphorylation and the expression of TNF-α and pro-IL-1β mRNA, indicating PTPN22 as an inhibitor of TLR4 signaling. Thus, LPS tolerance interferes with TLR4 signaling by inhibiting Lyn and c-Src phosphorylation and their recruitment to TLR4, while increasing the phosphatase activity and expression of PP2A, PTPN22, PTP1B and MKP.
te hemostasis is essential for clear visualization of the neural structures and cleavage planes. It is also essential for avoiding heat-induced injury, minimizing blood loss, and reducing operative tim.
ine the role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in platelet-dependent hemostasis during neurosurger.
fication of aggregation, activation of integrin αIIbβ3, intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, and activation of signaling cascades in platelets were evaluated. For comparison, various concentrations of a commercially available artificial CSF solution (aCSF) (Artcereb), an artificial CSF solution prepared by the authors, and normal saline (NS) were used. Differences between aCSF and NS in obtaining in vivo hemostasis were assessed by measuring the tail vein bleeding time in C57BL/6N mic.
aggregation was directly amplified by the addition of aCSF through increased activation of integrin αIIbβ3, phosphatidylserine exposure, and P-selectin expression. However, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were not primarily related to coagulation activity. Activation of Src kinase was related to platelet activation by aCSF. The elimination of sodium bicarbonate from aCSF and the addition of the selective inhibitor of the HCO3/Cl exchanger, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid disodium salt, significantly inhibited platelet aggregation. The bleeding time in aCSF-treated mice was significantly shorter than that in NS-treated mic.
carbonate facilitates hemostasis through amplification of platelet aggregation function. The existence of CSF and irrigation with aCSF provides better conditions for physiological hemostasis and has the potential of improving hemostasis by bipolar coagulation or with irrigation during neuroendoscopic procedure.

 to study the impact of Chaihushugan San (CSS) on the behavior of perimenopausal rats with liver-Qi stagnation (LQS) and to investigate the effect of CSS on signal transduction of the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in the hippocampi of rats induced by immobilizatio.
-week-old female rats were divided into two groups by the random number table method: model control group (MCG) and CSS group (CSSG), with 10 rats in each group. Ten-week-old female rats were used as the normal control group (NCG). CSS effects were assessed using rats exposed to immobilization stress by measuring body weight and sucrose consumption, serum hormone levels, and observing performance in the open field test (OFT). Molecular mechanisms were examined by measuring the effect of CSS on expression of Raf1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 mRNA in hippocampi using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and by measuring levels of these proteins and related phospho-proteins using Western blottin.
ausal rats with LQS had decreased locomotor activity; reduced sucrose consumption; and increased serum levels of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and corticosterone (CORT). Activation of hippocampal Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was suppressed significantly in the MCG, and activation was increased after 21 days of CSS treatmen.
ignificant effects upon relief of the symptoms of LQS in immobilization-induced rats. The mechanism underlying this action might (at least in part) be mediated by reversal of disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathwa.
ds (Cuminum cyminum L.) have been commonly used in food flavoring and perfumery. In this study, cumin essential oil (CuEO) extracted from seeds was employed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and the underlying mechanisms. A total of 26 volatile constituents were identified in CuEO by GC-MS, and the most abundant constituent was cuminaldehyde (48.773%). Mitochondrial-respiration-dependent 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) reduction assay demonstrated that CuEO did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect at the employed concentrations (0.0005-0.01%). Real-time PCR tests showed that CuEO significantly inhibited the mRNA expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), interleukin- (IL-) 1, and IL-6. Moreover, western blotting analysis revealed that CuEO blocked LPS-induced transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggested that CuEO exerted anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells via inhibition of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and JNK signaling; the chemical could be used as a source of anti-inflammatory agents as well as dietary complement for health promotio.
igate the effects of different concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) on proliferation and apoptosis of cultured cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) from neonatal mice and to elucidate related mechanism.
prague-Dawley (SD) rats were isolated and cultured and divided into normal control group and different concentration of NE intervention groups (0.1, 1, 10, 50, and 100 µmol/L). Water soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) assay was carried out to detect the viability of CFBs. Morphology of apoptosis cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscope with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The expressions of collagen I, collagen III, pro-oncogene c-myc in CFBs were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The phospho-mitogen activated protein kinase (p-p38MAPK) and caspase3 protein levels were examined by Western blo.
tion was significantly increased in 1 µmol/L and 10 µmol/L groups compared with the normal control group (1.05 ± 0.05 and 1.09 ± 0.02 vs. 1.00 ± 0.03, all P &lt; 0.05).CFBs apoptosis was significantly enhanced in 50 µmol/L and 100 µmol/L groups ((22.69 ± 2.18)% and (36.40 ± 6.80)% vs.(4.50 ± 1.08)%, all P &lt; 0.05). Expression of Collagen I peaked in 10 µmol/L group, expression of collagen III and c-myc increased dose-dependently in proportion to increasing NE concentrations (all P &lt; 0.05 vs. control group). The expression of p-p38MAPK and caspase3 was also significantly upregulated in a dose-dependent manner in NE groups (all P &lt; 0.05 vs. control group.
ntration NE induces CFBs proliferation and high concentration NE promotes CFBs apoptosis. p38MAPK phosphorylation may be a major mediator of NE-induced effects on CFB.
 smoking is one of the most important risk factors for the development of various diseases. Nicotine is the most extensively investigated component of cigarette smoke, and a comprehensive analysis of the genes induced by nicotine stimulation revealed that interleukin-8 (IL-8) was induced in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell (OSCC). Based on this background, the signaling mechanisms of nicotine-mediated IL-8 induction in OSCC was investigated. Augmented IL-8 secretion by Ca9-22 cells was blocked by the NF-κB inhibitor L-1-4'-tosylamino-phenylethyl-chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-specific inhibitor α-bungarotoxin (αBtx). The downstream signaling pathway was further examined by pre-incubating the cells with inhibitors against mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK II). Only the CaMK II inhibitor was found to exert an inhibitory effect on nicotine-mediated IL-8 secretion. Pre-treatment of the Ca9-22 cells with the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM drastically inhibited IL-8 secretion. Although nicotine stimulation induced the phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, pre-treatment with BAPTA-AM was found to inhibit this activity significantly. CaMK II-dependent p65 phosphorylation was confirmed by pre-incubation of the cells with CaMK II inhibitor. The results from this study indicate that the binding of nicotine to nAChR induces Ca(2+) influx, which results in the activation and phosphorylation of CaMK II and NF-κB p65, respectively. Nicotine-mediated IL-8 induction should be a trigger for the initiation of various diseases. J. Cell. Biochem. 9999: 1-7, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, In.
-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1, formerly known as GPR30) has been proposed as the receptor for estrogen-induced, growth of leiomyomas though its precise mechanisms of action are not clear. We obtained leiomyoma cells (LC) and normal smooth muscle cells from 28 women (n = 28, median age 38 years, median parity 1.0). We incubated them with 17-β estradiol (E2), after blocking, or upregulating, expression of GPER-1 with ICI182,780 (a GPER-1 agonist) and siGPR30, respectively. We evaluated the role of GPER-1 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway using Western blot analysis. We studied cell proliferation with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, and, mitotic activity with phosphohistone H3 (PPH3) expression in leiomyoma, and, matched, normal, smooth muscle tissues using standard immunohistochemistry. Downregulation of GPER-1 expression with siGPR30 partially attenuated the E2-activated MAPK signaling pathway (p &lt; 0.01). Upregulation of GPER-1 with ICI182,780 enhanced the E2-activated MAPK signaling pathway (p &lt; 0.01). ICI182,780 enhanced E2-induced proliferation of LC (p &lt; 0.01), while knock down of the GPER-1 gene with GPER-1 small interfering RNA partially inhibited E2-induced cell proliferation (p &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences in PPH3 expression between LCs and normal smooth muscle tissues (p &gt; 0.05). Neither ICI182,780 nor siGPR30 increased mitosis in LCs (p &gt; 0.05). Our results indicate that GPER-1 mediates proliferation of estrogen-induced, LC by activating the MAPK pathway, and, not by promoting mitosi.
ease is the leading cause of human death in the 21st century. Heart transplantation is a promising way to treat this. Because donor resources are limited, cell-based therapy has been developed as an alternative. Therefore, genes that trigger cardiogenesis could have potential in the treatment of heart disease. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is reported to stimulate cardiomyocyte proliferation under conditions of myocardial infarction, but little is known about its function during cardiac differentiation. In this study, we established an in vitro cardiogenesis model through a reliable chemical induction protocol to determine whether FGF1 and its gene expression are involved in cardiogenesis. Oxytocin, not only a well-known hormone but also a cardiac differentiation inducer, was used in a mouse embryonic stem cell line, E14Tg2a, to achieve cardiac differentiation. After differentiation, beating cell clusters appeared and the expression of FGF1B mRNA was upregulated in the late differentiation stage (differentiation days 8-14). Interestingly, FGF1B expression patterns during cardiac differentiation were similar to those of a mature cardiomyocyte marker, troponin T2, cardiac. The blockage of FGF1-FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling reduced not only the appearance of beating cluster formation but also the expression levels of cardiomyocyte-associated genes. Moreover, by investigating FGF1 downstream signaling cascades, we observed that the efficiency of beating cluster formation was mainly regulated through the FGF1-FGFR-PKC signaling axis. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that FGF1 could regulate cardiogenesis primarily through the protein kinase C signaling, but not through the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, pathwa.
1 (DKK-1) is an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalling and has been associated with the progression of osteolytic bone metastases by impairing osteoblast activity. In addition, there is growing evidence supporting a direct anti-tumour effect of DKK-1. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulates intracellular responses that have been linked to cell cycle, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. P38 inhibitors are currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of malignancies. However, the influence of p38 on DKK-1 in breast cancer remains elusive. In this work, we show that p38 inhibition using SB202190 or LY2228820 potently suppressed DKK-1 expression by MDA-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines as well melanoma derived MDA-435 cells. Vice versa, activation of p38 signalling by anisomycin induced DKK-1 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of DKK-1 expression in 97 breast cancer samples revealed that high expression of p38 was associated with a higher expression of DKK-1 compared to tumours with low p38 expression. In conclusion, these results support a role of p38 in the regulation of DKK-1 in osteolytic tumours and warrant further research on the potential of p38 inhibition for the treatment of malignant bone diseas.
f this study was to determine the role of ALDH2 in the injury of liver from brain-dead donors. Using brain-dead rabbit model and hypoxia model, levels of ALDH2 and apoptosis in tissues and cell lines were determined by Western blot, flow cytometry (FCM), and transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-16-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. After the expression of ALDH2 during hypoxia had been inhibited or activated, the accumulations of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and molecules involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were analyzed using ELISA kit and Western blot. The low expression of phosphorylated ALDH2 in liver was time-dependent in the brain-dead rabbit model. Immunohistochemistry showed ALDH2 was primarily located in endothelial, and the rates of cell apoptosis in the donation after brain-death (DBD) rabbit groups significantly increased with time. Following the treatment of inhibitor of ALDH2, daidzein, in combination with hypoxia for 8 h, the apoptosis rate and the levels of 4-HNE, P-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in contrast to that in hypoxic HUVECs; however, they all decreased after treatment with Alda-1 and hypoxia compared with that in hypoxic HUVECs (P &lt; 0.05). Instead, the levels of P-P38, P-ERK, P-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3 decreased and the ratio of bcl-2/bax increased with ad-ALDH2 (10(6) pfu/ml) in combination with hypoxia for 8 h, which significantly alleviated in contrast to that in hypoxic HUVECs. We found low expression of ALDH2 and high rates of apoptosis in the livers of brain-dead donor rabbits. Furthermore, decreased ALDH2 led to apoptosis in HUVECs through MAPK pathwa.
en activated protein kinase (MAPK) α modulates microglia-mediated inflammatory responses and a number of neuronal physiological processe.
te pre-clinically the pharmacological effects in the brain of p38 MAPKα inhibition with a brain-penetrant specific chemical antagonis.
 blood-brain barrier penetrant, highly selective p38 MAPKα inhibitor, and clinical stage investigational drug, was utilized. Initially, a pilot study in 26-month-old Tg2576 mice was conducted. Subsequently, a definitive dose-response study was conducted in aged (20-22 months) rats with identified cognitive deficits; n = 15 per group: vehicle, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 mg/kg VX-745 by oral gavage twice daily for 3 weeks. Assessments in aged rats included IL-1β, PSD-95, TNFα protein levels in hippocampus; and Morris water maze (MWM) test for cognitive performanc.
ct could not be assessed in Tg2576 mice, as little inflammation was evident. In cognitively-impaired aged rats, VX-745 led to significantly improved performance in the MWM and significant reduction in hippocampal IL-1β protein levels, though the effects were dissociated as the MWM effect was evident at a lower dose level than that required to lower IL-1β. Drug concentration-effect relationships and predicted human doses were determine.
 inhibition of p38 MAPKα with VX-745 in aged rats reduces hippocampal IL-1β levels and improves performance in the MWM. As the two effects occur at different dose levels, the behavioral effect appears to be via a mechanism that is independent of reducing cytokine production. The predicted human doses should minimize risks of systemic toxicit.
igate whether low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (US) has different protective effects on early and late rabbit osteoarthritis cartilage via the integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathwa.
x New Zealand White rabbits were divided into early control, early osteoarthritis, early treatment, late control, late osteoarthritis, and late treatment groups. The early and late osteoarthritis and treatment groups underwent anterior cruciate ligament transection. The remaining groups underwent sham operations with knee joint exposure. The early and late treatment groups were exposed to low-intensity pulsed US 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. After 6 weeks of US exposure, pathologic changes on the articular surface of the femoral condyle were assessed by modified Mankin scores. Expression of type II collagen, matrix metalloproteinase, integrin β1, phosphorylated FAK, and MAPKs (including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, MAPK 38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) was assessed by Western blot analysi.
 damage was less severe in the early treatment group than the early osteoarthritis group. The Mankin score was significantly lower in the early treatment group than the early osteoarthritis group (P &lt; .05). There was no significant difference in cartilage damage or Mankin score between the late treatment and late osteoarthritis groups. There was a significant increase in type II collagen expression but a significant decrease in matrix metalloproteinase 13 expression in the early treatment group compared to the early osteoarthritis group, whereas no significant difference was found between the late treatment and late osteoarthritis groups. Integrin β1 and phosphorylated FAK expression was significantly higher, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylated MAPK 38 expression was significantly lower in the early treatment group than the early osteoarthritis grou.
ngs indicate that low-intensity pulsed US protects cartilage from damage in early-stage osteoarthritis via the integrin/FAK/MAPK pathwa.
genesis of endometriosis, a common benign disease, remains ill-defined, although it is clear that chronic inflammation plays a crucial role through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. All current medical therapies for endometriosis are antigonadotropic, and therefore have a contraceptive effect. A concerted research effort is hence warranted with the aim of delivering novel therapeutics that reduces disease symptoms without blocking ovulation. Areas covered: The authors review the complex pathogenic mechanisms of chronic inflammation in endometriosis and their relationships with MAPK pathways. The authors conducted a literature search of descriptive and functional targeted validation of MAPK in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The effects of MAPK inhibitors, which constitute potential agents for future treatments, are also described. Expert opinion: Preliminary studies have highlighted a crucial role for MAPK in driving endometriosis-related inflammation. MAPK inhibitors exhibit potent activity in terms of controlling growth of endometriosis lesions both in vitro and in animal models. As MAPK inhibitors are known to have a multitude of undesirable side effects, their use in humans has to be approached with great care. Indeed, use of these drugs would probably be limited to short exposures prior to surgery in cases involving the most severe disease phenotype.
meric G-protein signaling has been shown to modulate a wide variety of intracellular signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. The activity of one MAPK family class, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), has been traditionally linked to the activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the plasma membrane. Using a unique set of G-protein signaling tools developed in our laboratory, we show that subcellular domain-specific JNK activity is inhibited by the activation of Gαi3, the Gαi isoform found predominantly within intracellular membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface, and their associated vesicle pools. Regulators of intracellular Gαi3, including activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3) and the regulator of G-protein signaling protein 4 (RGS4), have a marked impact on the regulation of JNK activity. Together, these data support the existence of unique intracellular signaling complexes that control JNK activity deep within the cell. This work highlights some of the cellular pathways that are regulated by these intracellular complexes and identifies potential strategies for their regulation in mammalian cell.
isone is a growth hormone frequently used in the treatment of low back pain. Hydrocortisone treatment has an anti-inflammation effect, which also inactivates glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition. Translocation of GLUT4 regulates body glucose homeostasis and muscle repair and is induced by insulin. In this study, 56 SD rats were divided into seven groups, and were treated with insulin or hydrocortisone in sedentary or exercise training groups. The muscle proteins and biochemical blood parameters were analyzed after 7 days of treatments. The results showed that the serum glucose increased in hydrocortisone treatment accompanied by GLUT4 inactivation in both the sedentary and exercise training rats. In the exercise training groups, GLUT4 was redistributed on the plasma membrane on co-treatment with insulin and hydrocortisone through Akt phosphorylation. Insulin treatment exerted a compensatory feedback effect on the GLUT4 translocation on hydrocortisone cotreatment, which was the cause of GLUT4 inactivatio.
y, we reported that nicotine withdrawal (NT) significantly increased pain sensitivity in rats. Recent reports suggest that fractalkine is involved in the spinal cord neuron-to-microglia activation via CX3CR1 signaling. However, its contribution to NT-induced hyperalgesia and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, a rat model of NT was used to test the changes in CX3CR1 expression in the spinal cord. We also evaluated the effect of the CX3CR1 neutralizing antibody on spinal microglial activity, the expression of phosphorylated p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38-MAPK) and heat-induced pain responses. We established a NT model via subcutaneous injection of pure nicotine (3&nbsp;mg/kg), three times daily for 7&nbsp;days. The expression of CX3CR1 was studied by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Following NT, the rats received daily intrathecal injections of CX3CR1 neutralizing antibody for 3&nbsp;days. The change in paw withdrawal latency (PWL) was observed. The activation of microglia and the expression of p-p38-MAPK were investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The expression of CX3CR1 was significantly increased after NT and co-localized with IBA-1. NT rats treated with CX3CR1 neutralizing antibody showed significantly increased PWL on day 4 after NT. Furthermore, the activation of microglia and the expression of p-p38-MAPK in the spinal cord were suppressed. These results indicate that microglial CX3CR1/p38MAPK pathway is critical for the development of pain hypersensitivity after N.
 the hypothesis that ingestion of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) prior to an acute session of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) would augment signalling cascades and gene expression linked to mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle. On two occasions separated by ~1 wk, nine men (22±2 y; 78±13 kg, VO2peak = 48±8 mL kg(-1) min(-1); mean ± SD) performed 10x60-s cycling efforts at an intensity eliciting ~90% of maximal heart rate (263±40 W), interspersed with 60 s of recovery. In a double-blind, crossover manner, subjects ingested a total of 0.4 g kg b.w.(-1) NaHCO3 prior to exercise (BICARB) or an equimolar amount of the placebo, sodium chloride (PLAC). Venous blood bicarbonate and pH were elevated at all time points post-ingestion (p&lt;0.05) in BICARB vs. PLAC. During exercise, muscle glycogen utilization (126±47 vs. 53±38 mmol kg d.w.(-1); p &lt; 0.05) and blood lactate accumulation (12.8±2.6 vs. 10.5±2.8 mmol L(-1); p &lt; 0.05) were greater in BICARB vs. PLAC. The acute exercise-induced increase in the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a downstream marker of AMP-activated protein kinase activity, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were similar between treatments (p&gt;0.05). However, the increase in PGC-1α mRNA expression after 3 h of recovery was higher in BICARB vs. PLAC (~7- vs. 5-fold compared to rest, p&lt;0.05). We conclude that NaHCO3 prior to HIIT alters the mRNA expression of this key regulatory protein associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. The elevated PGC-1α mRNA response provides a putative mechanism to explain the enhanced mitochondrial adaptation seen after chronic NaHCO3-supplemented HIIT in rat.
n of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) has been associated with the inhibition of inflammatory nociception and the attenuation of morphine antinociceptive tolerance. In this study, the authors investigated the impact of AMPK activation through resveratrol treatment on bone cancer pai.
eption was assessed by measuring the incidence of foot withdrawal in response to mechanical indentation in rats (n = 8). Cytokine expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (n = 8). Cell signalings were assayed by western blot (n = 4) and immunohistochemistry (n = 5). The microglial cell line BV-2, primary astrocytes, and neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells were cultured to investigate the in vitro effect.
ol and 5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide, the AMPK activators, significantly attenuated bone cancer pain in rats with tumor cell implantation (TCI; threshold of mechanical withdrawal, resveratrol vs. vehicle: 10.1 ± 0.56 vs. 4.1 ± 0.37; 5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide vs. vehicle: 8.2 ± 0.17 vs. 4.1 ± 0.37, mean ± SEM); these effects were reversed by the AMPK inhibitor compound C (compound C vs. resveratrol: 6.2 ± 1.35 vs. 10.1 ± 0.56, mean ± SEM). Resveratrol has an AMPK-dependent inhibitory effect on TCI-evoked astrocyte and microglial activation. The antinociceptive effects of resveratrol were partially mediated by the reduced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines in an AMPK-dependent manner. Furthermore, resveratrol potently inhibited inflammatory factors-mediated protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in neurons. Acute pain evoked by proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord was significantly attenuated by resveratro.
vation in the spinal glia by resveratrol may have utility in the treatment of TCI-induced neuroinflammation, and our results further implicate AMPK as a novel target for the attenuation of bone cancer pai.
c ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with a survival rate of 4-6 months from diagnosis. PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western world, with a mortality rate of 10 cases per 100,000 population. Chemotherapy constitutes only a palliative strategy, with limited effects on life expectanc.
igate the biological response of PDAC to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-kappaB (NF-kB) inhibitors and the role of autophagy in the modulation of these signaling pathways in order to address the challenge of developing improved medical protocols for patients with PDA.
cell lines, MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1, were used as PDAC models. Cells were exposed to inhibitors of MAPK or NF-kB survival pathways alone or after autophagy inhibition. Several aspects were analyzed, as follows: cell proliferation, by [(3)H]TdR incorporation; cell death, by TUNEL assay, regulation of autophagy by LC3-II expression level and modulation of pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins by Western blo.
trated that the inhibition of the MAPK and NF-kB survival pathways with U0126 and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), respectively, produced strong inhibition of pancreatic tumor cell growth without inducing apoptotic death. Interestingly, U0126 and CAPE induced apoptosis after autophagy inhibition in a caspase-dependent manner in MIA PaCa-2 cells and in a caspase-independent manner in PANC-1 cell.
resent evidence that allows us to consider a combined therapy regimen comprising an autophagy inhibitor and a MAPK or NF-kB pathway inhibitor as a possible treatment strategy for pancreatic cance.
 pathway plays a central role in tissue homoeostasis, and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. Core components of the Hippo pathway include a kinase cascade of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 and the transcription co-activators YAP/TAZ. In response to stimulation, LATS1/2 phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ, the main effectors of the Hippo pathway. Accumulating evidence suggests that MST1/2 are not required for the regulation of YAP/TAZ. Here we show that deletion of LATS1/2 but not MST1/2 abolishes YAP/TAZ phosphorylation. We have identified MAP4K family members-Drosophila Happyhour homologues MAP4K1/2/3 and Misshapen homologues MAP4K4/6/7-as direct LATS1/2-activating kinases. Combined deletion of MAP4Ks and MST1/2, but neither alone, suppresses phosphorylation of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ in response to a wide range of signals. Our results demonstrate that MAP4Ks act in parallel to and are partially redundant with MST1/2 in the regulation of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ, and establish MAP4Ks as components of the expanded Hippo pathwa.
inases are potential therapeutic targets for heart failure, but most studies of cardiac protein kinases derive from other systems, an approach that fails to account for specific kinases expressed in the heart and the contractile cardiomyocytes. We aimed to define the cardiomyocyte kinome (i.e. the protein kinases expressed in cardiomyocytes) and identify kinases with altered expression in human failing heart.
n profiling (Affymetrix microarrays) detected &gt;400 protein kinase mRNAs in rat neonatal ventricular myocytes (NVMs) and/or adult ventricular myocytes (AVMs), 32 and 93 of which were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated (greater than two-fold), respectively, in AVMs. Data for AGC family members were validated by qPCR. Proteomics analysis identified &gt;180 cardiomyocyte protein kinases, with high relative expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and other known cardiomyocyte kinases (e.g. CAMKs, cAMP-dependent protein kinase). Other kinases are poorly investigated (e.g. Slk, Stk24, Oxsr1). Expression of Akt1/2/3, BRaf, ERK1/2, Map2k1, Map3k8, Map4k4, MST1/3, p38-MAPK, PKCδ, Pkn2, Ripk1/2, Tnni3k, and Zak was confirmed by immunoblotting. Relative to total protein, Map3k8 and Tnni3k were up-regulated in AVMs vs. NVMs. Microarray data for human hearts demonstrated variation in kinome expression that may influence responses to kinase inhibitor therapies. Furthermore, some kinases were up-regulated (e.g. NRK, JAK2, STK38L) or down-regulated (e.g. MAP2K1, IRAK1, STK40) in human failing heart.
acterization of the spectrum of kinases expressed in cardiomyocytes and the heart (cardiomyocyte and cardiac kinomes) identified novel kinases, some of which are differentially expressed in failing human hearts and could serve as potential therapeutic target.
sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of KS, the most common AIDS-related malignancy. The majority of KS tumor cells harbor latent KSHV virus but only a small percentage undergoes spontaneous lytic replication. Viral reactivation from latency is crucial for the pathogenesis and development of KS, but the cellular mechanisms underlying the switch between viral latency and replication are not well understoo.
 of let-7 miRNAs and MAP4K4 in KSHV infected 293T cells were quantified by real-time PCRs. Let-7 expression was silenced by the miRNA sponge technique. In let-7a transfected 293T cells, the expression of MAP4K4 was measured by real-time PCR and western blot. Luciferease expression was employed to examine the effect of let-7a on the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the MAP4K4 gene in 293T cells. Real-time PCR was used to quantify the KSHV copy numbers in BC-3 cells in which the expression of let-7a and/or MAP4K4 were altered. Finally, ERK, JNK and p38 protein production and their phosphorylation status were detected by western blots in let-7a or MAP4K4 transfected BCBL-1 cell.
ssion of microRNA let-7 was dramatically decreased in KSHV infected 293T cells, but that of MAP4K4 was increased significantly. Let-7a is physically associated with and targets the MAP4K4 3'UTR, and inhibits MAP4K4 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. MAP4K4 stimulates KSHV reactivation from latency, whereas let-7a inhibits the function of MAP4K4 by reversing the function of MAP4K4 on JNK, phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK1/2 level.
ts establish that let-7a specifically suppresses MAP4K4 expression, and further inhibits KSHV reactivation by interfering with the function of MAP4K4 on the MAPK pathway, highlighting let-7a as a potential treatment for K.
determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) plays an important role in tumor cell metastasis and apoptosis. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), responsible for 1.5% of all cancers, is one of the most common head and neck malignancies. Accumulating evidence shows that SOX2 is overexpressed in several human tumors, including lung cancer, esophageal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, breast cancer, ovarian carcinoma and glioma. Our study aimed to investigate the silencing effects of SOX2 expression using RNA interference (RNAi) on various biological processes in laryngeal cancer TU212 cells, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. We also studied the involvement of the MAPK/JNK signaling pathway in the biological effects of SOX2 siRNA in TU212 cells. We found that silencing SOX2 decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of TU212 cells, and induced apoptosis. This effect of silencing SOX2 could be reversed by silencing MAP4K4. Therefore, we consider SOX2 as a key regulator of the upstream MAP4K4/JNK signaling pathways that could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with or prevention of laryngeal cance.
y reports on genetic susceptibility to ectopic calcification in the LG/J and SM/J advanced intercross mice. Using 347 mice in 98 full-sibships, destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM) was performed to induce joint injury. We found that joint destabilization instigated ectopic calcifications as detected and quantified by micro-CT. We performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to map ectopic calcification phenotypes to discrete genomic locations. To validate the functional significance of the selected QTL candidate genes, we compared mRNA expression between parental LG/J and SM/J inbred strains. Overall, we detected 20 QTLs affecting synovial and meniscus calcification phenotypes with 11 QTLs linked to synovial calcification. Functional and bioinformatic analyses of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified functional classifications relevant to angiogenesis (Myo1e, Kif26b, Nprl3, Stab2, Fam105b), bone metabolism/calcification (Tle3, Tgfb2, Lipc, Nfe2l1, Ank, Fam105b), arthritis (Stab2, Tbx21, Map4k4, Hoxb9, Larp6, Col1a2, Adam10, Timp3, Nfe2l1, Trpm3), and ankylosing-spondylitis (Ank, Pon1, Il1r2, Tbkbp1) indicating that ectopic calcification involves multiple mechanisms. Furthermore, the expression of 11 out of 78 candidate genes was significantly different between LG/J and SM/J. Correlation analysis showed that Aff3, Fam81a, Syn3, and Ank were correlated with synovial calcification. Taken together, our findings of multiple genetic loci suggest the involvement of multiple genes contributing to ectopic calcification. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

ve loss and impaired restoration of neuronal activity are hallmarks of neurological diseases, and new small molecules with neurotrophic activity are in high demand. The militarinone alkaloids and structurally simplified analogues with 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone core structure induce pronounced neurite outgrowth, but their protein target has not been identified. Reported herein is the synthesis of a militarinone-inspired 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone collection, its investigation for enhancement of neurite outgrowth, and the discovery of the stress pathway kinase MAP4K4 as a target of the discovered neuritogenic pyridones. The most potent 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone is a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of MAP4K4 but not of the other stress pathway related kinases, as proven by biochemical analysis and by a crystal structure of the inhibitor in complex with MAP4K4. The findings support the notion that MAP4K4 may be a new target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.
forming a fragment based screen the resulting hits need to be prioritized for follow-up structure elucidation and chemistry. This paper describes a new similarity metric, Atom-Atom-Path (AAP) similarity that is used in conjunction with the Directed Sphere Exclusion (DISE) clustering method to effectively organize and prioritize the fragment hits. The AAP similarity rewards common substructures and recognizes minimal structure differences. The DISE method is order-dependent and can be used to enrich fragments with properties of interest in the first cluster.
 of the software is demonstrated by its application to the MAP4K4 fragment screening hits using ligand efficiency (LE) as quality measure. The first clusters contain the hits with the highest LE. The clustering results can be easily visualized in a LE-over-clusters scatterplot with points colored by the members' similarity to the corresponding cluster seed. The scatterplot enables the extraction of preliminary SA.
led structure differentiation of the AAP similarity metric is ideal for fragment-sized molecules. The order-dependent nature of the DISE clustering method results in clusters ordered by a property of interest to the teams. The combination of both allows for efficient prioritization of fragment hit for follow-ups. Graphical abstractAAP similarity computation and DISE clustering visualizatio.
tive of this study was to investigate the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and TLR-associated signalling pathway genes in oral lichen planus (OLP.
, immunohistochemistry was used to determine TLR expression in 12 formalin-fixed archival OLP tissues with 12 non-specifically inflamed oral tissues as controls. RNA was isolated from further fresh samples of OLP and non-specifically inflamed oral tissue controls (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 for both groups) and used in qRT(2) -PCR focused arrays to determine the expression of TLRs and associated signalling pathway genes. Genes with a statistical significance of ±two-fold regulation (FR) and a P-value&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05 were considered as significantly regulate.
ntly more TLR4(+) cells were present in the inflammatory infiltrate in OLP compared with the control tissues (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the numbers of TLR2(+) and TLR8(+) cells between the groups. TLR3 was significantly downregulated in OLP (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01). TLR8 was upregulated in OLP, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. The TLR-mediated signalling-associated protein genes MyD88 and TIRAP were significantly downregulated (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01 and P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), as were IRAK1 (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), MAPK8 (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01), MAP3K1 (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), MAP4K4 (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), REL (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01) and RELA (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01). Stress proteins HMGB1 and the heat shock protein D1 were significantly downregulated in OLP (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.01.
dings suggest a downregulation of TLR-mediated signalling pathways in OLP lesion.
ation is a stepwise process that coordinates multiple molecular machineries. Using in vitro angiogenesis screens with short interfering RNA and chemical inhibitors, we define here a MAP4K4-moesin-talin-β1-integrin molecular pathway that promotes efficient plasma membrane retraction during endothelial cell migration. Loss of MAP4K4 decreased membrane dynamics, slowed endothelial cell migration, and impaired angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In migrating endothelial cells, MAP4K4 phosphorylates moesin in retracting membranes at sites of focal adhesion disassembly. Epistasis analyses indicated that moesin functions downstream of MAP4K4 to inactivate integrin by competing with talin for binding to β1-integrin intracellular domain. Consequently, loss of moesin (encoded by the MSN gene) or MAP4K4 reduced adhesion disassembly rate in endothelial cells. Additionally, α5β1-integrin blockade reversed the membrane retraction defects associated with loss of Map4k4 in vitro and in vivo. Our study uncovers a novel aspect of endothelial cell migration. Finally, loss of MAP4K4 function suppressed pathological angiogenesis in disease models, identifying MAP4K4 as a potential therapeutic targe.
astoma (MB) comprises four molecularly and genetically distinct subgroups of embryonal brain tumors that develop in the cerebellum. MB mostly affects infants and children and is difficult to treat because of frequent dissemination of tumor cells within the leptomeningeal space. A potential promoter of cell dissemination is the c-Met proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, which is aberrantly expressed in many human tumors including MB. Database analysis showed that c-Met is highly expressed in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup and in a small subset of Group 3 and Group 4&nbsp;MB tumors. Using a cell-based three-dimensional cell motility assay combined with live-cell imaging, we investigated whether the c-Met ligand HGF could drive dissemination of MB cells expressing high levels of c-Met, and determined downstream effector mechanisms of this process. We detected variable c-Met expression in different established human MB cell lines, and we found that in lines expressing high c-Met levels, HGF promoted cell dissemination and invasiveness. Specifically, HGF-induced c-Met activation enhanced the capability of the individual cells to migrate in a JNK-dependent manner. Additionally, we identified the Ser/Thr kinase MAP4K4 as a novel driver of c-Met-induced invasive cell dissemination. This increased invasive motility was due to MAP4K4 control of F-actin dynamics in structures required for migration and invasion. Thus, MAP4K4 couples growth factor signaling to actin cytoskeleton regulation in tumor cells, suggesting that MAP4K4 could present a promising novel target to be evaluated for treating growth factor-induced dissemination of MB tumors of different subgroups and of other human cancer.
wth cascade is a complicated and multistep process with numerous obstacles. Until recently, evidences have shown the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we explored the role of miR-194 and its downstream pathway in CRC. We acquired data through miRNA microarray profiles, showing that the expression of miR-194 was significantly suppressed in CRC tissues compared with corresponding noncancerous tissues. Decreased miR-194 expression was obviously associated with tumor size and tumor differentiation, as well as TNM stage. Both Kaplan-Meier and multivariate survival analysis showed that downregulated miR-194 was associated with overall survival. Moreover, functional assays indicated that overexpression of miR-194 in CRC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, we found MAP4K4 was the direct target of miR-194. Silencing of MAP4K4 resulted in similar biological behavior changes to that of overexpression of miR-194. We also observed through Human Gene Expression Array that MDM2 was one of the downstream targets of MAP4K4. Knockdown of MAP4K4 downregulated MDM2 expression through transcription factor c-Jun binding to the -1063 to -1057&nbsp;bp of the promoter. These results suggest that miR-194, regulating the MAP4K4/c-Jun/MDM2 signaling pathway, might act as a tumor suppressor and serve as a novel target for CRC prevention and therap.
o the mammalian intestine, the Drosophila adult midgut has resident stem cells that support growth and regeneration. How the niche regulates intestinal stem cell activity in both mammals and flies is not well understood. Here, we show that the conserved germinal center protein kinase Misshapen restricts intestinal stem cell division by repressing the expression of the JAK-STAT pathway ligand Upd3 in differentiating enteroblasts. Misshapen, a distant relative to the prototypic Warts activating kinase Hippo, interacts with and activates Warts to negatively regulate the activity of Yorkie and the expression of Upd3. The mammalian Misshapen homolog MAP4K4 similarly interacts with LATS (Warts homolog) and promotes inhibition of YAP (Yorkie homolog). Together, this work reveals that the Misshapen-Warts-Yorkie pathway acts in enteroblasts to control niche signaling to intestinal stem cells. These findings also provide a model in which to study requirements for MAP4K4-related kinases in MST1/2-independent regulation of LATS and YA.
tin family of proteins, comprising STRN, STRN3 and STRN4, are multidomain-containing proteins that associate with additional proteins to form a large protein complex. We previously reported that STRN4 directly associated with protein kinases, such as MINK1, TNIK and MAP4K4, which are associated with tumor suppression or tumor progression. However, it remains unclear whether STRN4 is associated with tumor progression. In this report, we examined the role that STRN4 plays in cancer malignancy. We show that depletion of STRN4 suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion and the anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells. In addition, STRN4 knockdown increases the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. Finally, we show that STRN4 knockdown suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells in mice. Our results demonstrate a possible role of STRN4 in tumor progressio.
t activation and proliferation are important for fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation, a crucial process in the pathological changes that define renal interstitial fibrosis. The left-right determination factor (Lefty) is an important cytokine of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family, with two variants, Lefty-1 and Lefty-2, in mice. Lefty has diverse functions, such as the regulation of embryonic development, the inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling, and the suppression of tumor activity. However, whether Lefty-1 influences fibroblast activation and proliferation, and consequently prevents fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether Lefty-1 can attenuate TGF-β1-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblast cells (NRK-49F), as well as the mechanisms underlying any effects. Results showed that the typical fibroblast cell morphology of NRK-49F cells was altered after TGF-β1 treatment and that Lefty-1 significantly prevented this change in a dose-dependent manner. Further analyses demonstrated decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, collagen I(A1), alpha-smooth muscle actin, and fibronectin expression. Lefty-1 further induced remarkable reductions in TGF-β1-induced Smad3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase-10/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-3) signaling, and enhanced expression of the antifibrotic factor bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-5. However, without TGF-β1, Lefty-1 had no effect on Smad3, JNK-3, and BMP-5 activation and fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Lefty-1 can alleviate TGF-β1-mediated activation and the proliferation of fibroblasts. Furthermore, Lefty-1 may prevent fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation in part via modulations of Smad3, JNK-3, and BMP-5 activities in the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathwa.
a major is a parasite that resides and replicates in macrophages. We previously showed that the parasite enhanced CD40-induced Raf-MEK-ERK signaling but inhibited PI3K-MKK-p38MAPK signaling to proleishmanial effects. As Raf and PI3K have a Ras-binding domain but exert opposite effects on Leishmania infection, we examined whether Ras isoforms had differential roles in Leishmania infection. We observed that L. major enhanced N-Ras and H-Ras expression but inhibited K-Ras expression in macrophages. L. major infection enhanced N-Ras activity but inhibited H-Ras and K-Ras activity. TLR2 short hairpin RNA or anti-TLR2 or anti-lipophosphoglycan Abs reversed the L. major-altered N-Ras and K-Ras expressions. Pam3CSK4, a TLR2 ligand, enhanced N-Ras expression but reduced K-Ras expression, indicating TLR2-regulated Ras expression in L. major infection. Whereas N-Ras silencing reduced L. major infection, K-Ras and H-Ras silencing enhanced the infection both in macrophages in vitro and in C57BL/6 mice. BALB/c-derived macrophages transduced with lentivirally expressed N-Ras short hairpin RNA and pulsed with L. major-expressed MAPK10 enhanced MAPK10-specific Th1-type response. CD40-deficient mice primed with these macrophages had reduced L. major infection, accompanied by higher IFN-γ but less IL-4 production. As N-Ras is activated by Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, we modeled the N-Ras-Sos interaction and designed two peptides from their interface. Both the cell-permeable peptides reduced L. major infection in BALB/c mice but not in CD40-deficient mice. These data reveal the L. major-enhanced CD40-induced N-Ras activation as a novel immune evasion strategy and the potential for Ras isoform-targeted antileishmanial immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxi.
edicinal chemistry lead optimization studies focused on calculated properties and guided by X-ray crystallography and computational modeling, potent pan-JNK inhibitors were identified that showed submicromolar activity in a cellular assay. Using in vitro ADME profiling data, 9t was identified as possessing favorable permeability and a low potential for efflux, but it was rapidly cleared in liver microsomal incubations. In a mouse pharmacokinetics study, compound 9t was brain-penetrant after oral dosing, but exposure was limited by high plasma clearance. Brain exposure at a level expected to support modulation of a pharmacodynamic marker in mouse was achieved when the compound was coadministered with the pan-cytochrome P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazol.
tivated c-Jun N-terminal Kinase-3 (JNK3) has been reported to act on mitochondrion to promote neuronal cell death. Phosphorylation of mitochondrial Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) plays an important role in mitochondria-mediated cell death. Keeping these in view phosphorylation of rat brain VDAC by JNK3 has been studied in vitro. Pro Q Diamond phospho-protein staining experiment demonstrates VDAC is phosphorylated by JNK3. Bilayer electrophysiological experiments show that single-channel conductance of VDAC phosphorylated by JNK3 is significantly lower than that of the native VDAC at a membrane potential. The opening probability of VDAC undergoes massive reduction due to phosphorylation by JNK3. These indicate closure of VDAC due to phosphorylation by JNK3. Treatment of phosphorylated VDAC with alkaline phosphatase reversed the VDAC functional activity as shown by single-channel current and opening probability. The physiological consequence of closure of VDAC as a result of phosphorylation has been attributed to JNK3 dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosi.
igate whether activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) promotes the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by upregulating the protein levels of c-jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3.
 receptor 3-specific activator, Poly(I:C) (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid), or PBS was injected into the vitreous humor of Thy1-YFP mice. At 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatments, degeneration of RGCs was assessed by using antibodies against brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3a (Brn3a). A TLR3-specific inhibitor was injected into the vitreous humor with or without Poly(I:C). Western blot assays were performed to determine relative levels of TLR3, JNK3, pJNK3, and sterile alpha and HEAT/Armadillo motif-containing 1 (SARM1) proteins in retinal protein extracts, and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to determine their cellular localization in the retina. Mouse eyes were treated with Poly(I:C) or PBS along with MitoTracker Red, and colocalization of MitoTracker Red and JNK3 in the retinas was determined by using antibodies against JNK.
 activated TLR3 and upregulated its downstream target protein JNK3 but not SARM1 in the retina. Poly(I:C) activated TLR3 and upregulated JNK3 specifically in RGCs and promoted a significant degeneration of RGCs over a 72-hour time period. Toll-like receptor 3 upregulated the levels of JNK3 protein in the cytoplasm of RGCs, but not in the mitochondria. Toll-like receptor 3-specific inhibitor downregulated Poly(I:C)-mediated upregulation of JNK3 protein, and, in turn, significantly attenuated TLR3-induced degeneration of RGC.
resented in this study show that the activation of TLR3 alone promotes the degeneration of RGCs by upregulating the protein levels of JNK.
 charantia (MC) is a medicinal plant for stroke treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine, but its active compounds and molecular targets are unknown yet. M. charantia polysaccharide (MCP) is one of the important bioactive components in MC. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that MCP has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through scavenging superoxide (O2(-)), nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK3) signaling cascades. We conducted experiments with in vivo global and focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rat models and in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) neural cells. The effects of MCP on apoptotic cell death and infarction volume, the bioactivities of scavenging O2(-), NO and ONOO(-), inhibiting lipid peroxidation and modulating JNK3 signaling pathway were investigated. Major results are summarized as below: (1) MCP dose-dependently attenuated apoptotic cell death in neural cells under OGD condition in vitro and reduced infarction volume in ischemic brains in vivo; (2) MCP had directing scavenging effects on NO, O2(-) and ONOO(-) and inhibited lipid peroxidation; (3) MCP inhibited the activations of JNK3/c-Jun/Fas-L and JNK3/cytochrome C/caspases-3 signaling cascades in ischemic brains in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that MCP could be a promising neuroprotective ingredient of M. charantia and its mechanisms could be at least in part attributed to its antioxidant activities and inhibiting JNK3 signaling cascades during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injur.
 with rotenone, both in vitro and in vivo, is widely used to model dopamine neuron death in Parkinson's disease upon exposure to environmental neurotoxicants and pesticides. Mechanisms underlying rotenone neurotoxicity are still being defined. Our recent studies suggest that rotenone-induced dopamine neuron death involves microtubule destabilization, which leads to accumulation of cytosolic dopamine and consequently reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is required for rotenone-induced dopamine neuron death. Here we report that the neural specific JNK3 isoform of the JNKs, but not JNK1 or JNK2, is responsible for this neuron death in primary cultured dopamine neurons. Treatment with taxol, a microtubule stabilizing agent, attenuates rotenone-induced phosphorylation and presumably activation of JNK. This suggests that JNK is activated by microtubule destabilization upon rotenone exposure. Moreover, rotenone inhibits VMAT2 activity but not VMAT2 protein levels. Significantly, treatment with SP600125, a pharmacological inhibitor of JNKs, attenuates rotenone inhibition of VMAT2. Furthermore, decreased VMAT2 activity following in vitro incubation of recombinant JNK3 protein with purified mesencephalic synaptic vesicles suggests that JNK3 can inhibit VMAT2 activity. Together with our previous findings, these results suggest that rotenone induces dopamine neuron death through a series of sequential events including microtubule destabilization, JNK3 activation, VMAT2 inhibition, accumulation of cytosolic dopamine, and generation of ROS. Our data identify JNK3 as a novel regulator of VMAT2 activit.
 N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) is expressed primarily in the brain. Numerous reports have shown that inhibition of JNK3 is a promising strategy for treatment of neurodegeneration. The optimization of aminopyrazole-based JNK3 inhibitors with improved potency, isoform selectivity, and pharmacological properties by structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies utilizing biochemical and cell-based assays, and structure-based drug design is reported. These inhibitors had high selectivity over JNK1 and p38α, minimal cytotoxicity, potent inhibition of 6-OHDA-induced mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and ROS generation, and good drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties for iv dosing. 26n was profiled against 464 kinases and was found to be highly selective hitting only seven kinases with &gt;80% inhibition at 10 μM. Moreover, 26n showed good solubility, good brain penetration, and good DMPK properties. Finally, the crystal structure of 26k in complex with JNK3 was solved at 1.8 Å to explore the binding mode of aminopyrazole based JNK3 inhibitor.
 N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) play important roles in cell responses to stress or growth factor stimulation. The JNK1α1 isoform shares &gt;90% identity with a predominantly neuronal JNK3α1 isoform, but JNK3α1 also includes a distinctive 38 amino acid N-terminal sequence. To address the outstanding question of the potential for these JNK isoforms to have different binding partners that mediate different biological actions, the work presented here refined the yeast two-hybrid approach to identify and categorize binding partners for JNK1α1 and JNK3α1. Specifically, site-directed mutagenesis of the JNK1α1 common docking (CD) domain that mediates typical JNK-binding domain (JBD)-dependent interactions, truncation of the distinctive JNK3 N-terminal domain (i.e. ΔN JNK3α1), and interaction evaluation in the yeast two-hybrid system defined the interacting partners as either JNK1-specific interactors (ATF7, FUS, KCNE4, PIAS1, SHANK1, TKT), typical JBD-dependent interactors shared by JNK1α1 and JNK3α1 (AKAP6, BMPR2, EEF1A1, GFAP, GRIP2, GTF2F1, HDAC2, MAP1B, MYO9B, PTPN2, RABGAP1, RUSC2, SUMO1, SYPL1, TOPBP1, ZNF668), or JNK3-specific partners (ATXN1, NNAT, PTGDS) dependent on interaction with the JNK3 N-terminal extension. The interacting partners ATF7, AKAP6, and ATXN1 were explored further as representatives of these different classes. Two potential JBDs were identified in ATF7 as important for its interaction with JNK1α1, but additionally an interaction between ATF7 and ΔN JNK3α1 was shown to be JBD-dependent, suggesting that the JNK3α1 N-terminus prevents interaction with some proteins. For the shared partner AKAP6, one of the multiple potential JBDs predicted by sequence analysis was important for the AKAP6-JNK interaction in the yeast screening system as well as in mammalian cells. Finally, the ATXN1-JNK3α1 interaction was dependent on the JNK3α1 N-terminus in a mammalian cell context. These studies therefore highlight a diversity of potential JNK-interacting partners with both JBD-dependent as well as JBD-independent modes of interactio.
of human Jurkat T cells to JNK inhibitor IX (JNKi), targeting JNK2 and JNK3, caused apoptotic DNA fragmentation along with G2/M arrest, phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bim, Δψm loss, and activation of Bak and caspase cascade. These JNKi-induced apoptotic events were abrogated by Bcl-2 overexpression, whereas G2/M arrest, cyclin B1 up-regulation, Cdk1 activation, and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins were sustained. In the concomitant presence of the G1/S blocking agent aphidicolin and JNKi, the cells underwent G1/S arrest and failed to induce all apoptotic events. The JNKi-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins and mitochondrial apoptotic events were suppressed by the Cdk1 inhibitor. Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that mitotic spindle defect and prometaphase arrest were the underlying factors for the G2/M arrest. These results demonstrate that JNKi-induced mitochondrial apoptosis was caused by microtubule damage-mediated prometaphase arrest, prolonged Cdk1 activation, and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins in Jurkat T cell.
kainate receptors play important roles in ischemic stroke, the molecular mechanisms underlying postischemic regulation of kainate receptors remain unclear. In this study we demonstrate that Src family kinases contribute to the potentiation of kainate receptor function. Brain ischemia and reperfusion induce rapid and sustained phosphorylation of the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 by Src in the rat hippocampus, implicating a critical role for Src-mediated GluK2 phosphorylation in ischemic brain injury. The NMDA and kainate receptors are involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of GluK2. GluK2 binds to Src, and the tyrosine residue at position 590 (Y590) on GluK2 is a major site of phosphorylation by Src kinases. GluK2 phosphorylation at Y590 is responsible for increases in whole-cell currents and calcium influx in response to transient kainate stimulation. In addition, GluK2 phosphorylation at Y590 facilitates the endocytosis of GluK2 subunits, and the activation of JNK3 and its substrate c-Jun after long-term kainate treatment. Thus, Src phosphorylation of GluK2 plays an important role in the opening of kainate receptor channels and downstream proapoptosis signaling after brain ischemia. The present study reveals an additional mechanism for the regulation of GluK2-containing kainate receptors by Src family kinases, which may be of pathological significance in ischemic strok.
ies have characterized how changes to the stability and internal motions of a protein during activation can contribute to their catalytic function, even when structural changes cannot be observed. Here, unfolding studies and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HX) mass spectrometry were used to investigate the changes to the stability and conformation/conformational dynamics of JNK1β1 induced by phosphorylative activation. Equivalent studies were also employed to determine the effects of nucleotide binding on both inactive and active JNK1β1 using the ATP analogue, 5'-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). JNK1β1 phosphorylation alters HX in regions involved in catalysis and substrate binding, changes that can be ascribed to functional modifications in either structure and/or backbone flexibility. Increased HX in the hinge between the N- and C-terminal domains implied that it acquires enhanced flexibility upon phosphorylation that may be a prerequisite for interdomain closure. In combination with the finding that nucleotide binding destabilizes the kinase, the patterns of solvent protection by AMP-PNP were consistent with a novel mode of nucleotide binding to the C-terminal domain of a destabilized and open domain conformation of inactive JNK1β1. Solvent protection by AMP-PNP of both N- and C-terminal domains in active JNK1β1 revealed that the domains close around nucleotide upon phosphorylation, concomitantly stabilizing the kinase. This suggests that phosphorylation activates JNK1β1 in part by increasing hinge flexibility to facilitate interdomain closure and the creation of a functional active site. By uncovering the complex interplay that occurs between nucleotide binding and phosphorylation, we present new insight into the unique mechanisms by which JNK1β1 is regulate.
studies have suggested that the novel BH3 mimetic S1 could induce apoptosis in diverse tumor cell lines through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or mitochondrial cell death pathways. The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) through inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) is closely connected to ER stress-induced apoptosis. However, the role of JNK is complex, as there are different JNK subtypes and the function of each subtype is still not entirely clear. Here we found that the mRNA expression of JNK3 was continuously high in S1-treated human ovarian cancer SKOV3/DDP cells using a human unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway PCR array. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK3 increased cell sensitivity to apoptosis induced by S1. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK3 induced accumulation of both acidic compartment and p62, and upregulated ROS production. Our results suggest that JNK3 plays a pro-survival role during ER stress through preventing the block of autophagic flux and reducing oxidative stress in SKOV3/DDP cells. Inhibition of JNK3 may be a potential method to enhance the killing effect of the Bcl-2 inhibitor S.
ion of beta cell against apoptosis is one of the therapeutic benefits of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) antidiabetic mimetics for preserving the functional beta cell mass exposed to diabetogenic condition including proinflammatory cytokines. The mitogen activated protein kinase 10 also called c-jun amino-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) plays a protective role in insulin-secreting cells against death caused by cytokines. In this study, we investigated whether the JNK3 expression is associated with the protective effect elicited by the GLP1 mimetic exendin 4. We found an increase in the abundance of JNK3 in isolated human islets and INS-1E cells cultured with exendin 4. Induction of JNK3 by exendin 4 was associated with an increased survival of INS-1E cells. Silencing of JNK3 prevented the cytoprotective effect of exendin 4 against apoptosis elicited by culture condition and cytokines. These results emphasize the requirement of JNK3 in the antiapoptotic effects of exendin .
n readthrough is used extensively by viruses to expand their gene expression. Until recent discoveries in Drosophila, only a very limited number of readthrough cases in chromosomal genes had been reported. Analysis of conserved protein coding signatures that extend beyond annotated stop codons identified potential stop codon readthrough of four mammalian genes. Here we use a modified targeted bioinformatic approach to identify a further three mammalian readthrough candidates. All seven genes were tested experimentally using reporter constructs transfected into HEK-293T cells. Four displayed efficient stop codon readthrough, and these have UGA immediately followed by CUAG. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that in the four readthrough candidates containing UGA-CUAG, this motif is conserved not only in mammals but throughout vertebrates with the first six of the seven nucleotides being universally conserved. The importance of the CUAG motif was confirmed using a systematic mutagenesis approach. One gene, OPRL1, encoding an opiate receptor, displayed extremely efficient levels of readthrough (∼31%) in HEK-293T cells. Signals both 5' and 3' of the OPRL1 stop codon contribute to this high level of readthrough. The sequence UGA-CUA alone can support 1.5% readthrough, underlying its importanc.
oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules during angiogenesis; however, the mechanisms used for such signaling events remain unclear. Stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) is one of the most potent angiogenic chemokines. Here, we examined the role of ROS in the regulation of SDF-1α-dependent angiogenesi.
rtic endothelial cells were treated with SDF-1α, and intracellular ROS generation was monitored. SDF-1α treatment induced bovine aortic endothelial cell migration and ROS generation, with the majority of ROS generated by bovine aortic endothelial cells at the leading edge of the migratory cells. Antioxidants and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) inhibitors blocked SDF-1α-induced endothelial migration. Furthermore, knockdown of either NOX5 or p22phox (a requisite subunit for NOX1/2/4 activation) significantly impaired endothelial motility and tube formation, suggesting that multiple NOXs regulate SDF-1α-dependent angiogenesis. Our previous study demonstrated that c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 activity is essential for SDF-1α-dependent angiogenesis. Here, we identified that NOX5 is the dominant NOX required for SDF-1α-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 activation and that NOX5 and MAP kinase phosphatase 7 (MKP7; the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 phosphatase) associate with one another but decrease this interaction on SDF-1α treatment. Furthermore, MKP7 activity was inhibited by SDF-1α, and this inhibition was relieved by NOX5 knockdown, indicating that NOX5 promotes c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 activation by blocking MKP7 activit.
de that NOX is required for SDF-1α signaling and that intracellular redox balance is critical for SDF-1α-induced endothelial migration and angiogenesi.
matching analyses show that Clostridium tetani neurotoxin shares numerous pentapeptides (68, including multiple occurrences) with 42 human proteins that, when altered, have been associated with epilepsy. Such a peptide sharing is higher than expected, nonstochastic, and involves tetanus toxin-derived epitopes that have been validated as immunopositive in the human host. Of note, an unexpected high level of peptide matching is found in mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MK10), a protein selectively expressed in hippocampal areas. On the whole, the data indicate a potential for cross-reactivity between the neurotoxin and specific epilepsy-associated proteins and may help evaluate the potential risk for epilepsy following immune responses induced by tetanus infection. Moreover, this study may contribute to clarifying the etiopathogenesis of the different types of epileps.
 is known to improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, but it poorly absorbed into the blood stream from the gut. Therefore, the exact underlying mechanism for berberine is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of berberine on glucose metabolism in diabetic rats and tested the hypothesis that berberine acts directly in the terminal ileum.
 divided into a control group, diabetic group (DM), low dose of berberine group (BerL) and high dose of berberine group (BerH). Ileum samples were analyzed using a Roche NimbleGen mRNA array, qPCR and immunohistochemistr.
that 8&nbsp;weeks of treatment with berberine significantly decreased fasting blood glucose levels. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed that blood glucose was significantly reduced in the BerL and BerH groups before and at 30&nbsp;min, 60&nbsp;min and 120&nbsp;min after oral glucose administration. Plasma postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were increased in the berberine-treated groups. The ileum from the BerH group had 2112 genes with significantly changed expression (780 increased, 1332 decreased). KEGG pathway analyses indicated that all differentially expressed genes included 9 KEGG pathways. The top two pathways were the MAPK signaling pathway and the GnRH signaling pathway. Q-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry verified that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (Glp1r) and mitogen activated protein kinase 10 (Mapk10) were significantly up-regulated, in contrast, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (Gnrhr) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (Gnrh1) were down-regulated in the BerH grou.
suggest that berberine can improve blood glucose levels in diabetic rats. The mechanisms involved may be in the MAPK and GnRh-Glp-1 pathways in the ileu.
the molecular mechanisms driving chemoresistance and relapse of ovarian cancer have been widely studied, the key molecules have not been identified. In this study, the expression of miR-29b messenger RNA (mRNA) and its targeted genes, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), and autophagy-related protein 9A (ATG9A), were investigated in ovarian carcinomas, and their associations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival of patients with ovarian cancer were analyzed. The protein expression of MCL1, MAPK10, and ATG9A was measured using immunohistochemistry. miR-29b mRNA and ATG9A gene mRNA levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results demonstrated that the percentage of MCL1, MAPK10, and ATG9A protein-positive cases were significantly higher, whereas miR-29b was significantly lower in ovarian serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas than that in normal tissues. MAPK10 was significantly associated with higher histopathologic grading. The percentage of positive myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, ATG9A, and MAPK10 protein expression and low miR-29b mRNA expression were significantly higher in cases with clinical stage III and IV ovarian cancer than in cases with clinical stage II ovarian cancer. High ATG9A protein and low miR-29b mRNA expression were significantly associated with relapse. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a negative correlation between MAPK10 or ATG9A protein expression and overall as well as progression-free survival, whereas a positive correlation was observed between miR-29b mRNA expression and overall as well as progression-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that elevated MAPK10 or ATG9A protein and lowered miR-29b mRNA expression in ovarian carcinoma was an independent poor prognostic predictor. Our study suggested that miR-29b mRNA, MAPK10 protein expression, and ATG9A protein expression are closely related to chemosensitivity of ovarian carcinom.
 N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are stress-activated serine-threonine kinases that have recently been linked to various neurological disorders. We previously described a patient with intellectual disability (ID) and seizures (Patient 1), carrying a de novo chromosome translocation affecting the CNS-expressed MAPK10/JNK3 gene. Here, we describe a second ID patient (Patient 2) with a similar translocation that likewise truncates MAPK10/JNK3, highlighting a role for JNK3 in human brain development. We have pinpointed the breakpoint in Patient 2, which is just distal to that in Patient 1. In both patients, the rearrangement resulted in a predicted protein interrupted towards the C-terminal end of the kinase domain. We demonstrate that these truncated proteins, although capable of weak interaction with various known JNK scaffolds, are not capable of phosphorylating the classical JNK target c-Jun in vitro, which suggests that the patient phenotype potentially arises from partial loss of JNK3 function. We next investigated JNK3-binding partners to further explore potential disease mechanisms. We identified PSD-95, SAP102 and SHANK3 as novel interaction partners for JNK3, and we demonstrate that JNK3 and PSD-95 exhibit partially overlapping expression at synaptic sites in cultured hippocampal neurons. Moreover, JNK3, like JNK1, is capable of phosphorylating PSD-95 in vitro, whereas disease-associated mutant JNK3 proteins do not. We conclude that reduced JNK3 activity has potentially deleterious effects on neuronal function via altered regulation of a set of post-synaptic protein.
ung disease (HSCR) is a neurocristopathy characterized by absence of intramural ganglion cells along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. The HSCR phenotype is highly variable with respect to gender, length of aganglionosis, familiality and the presence of additional anomalies. By molecular genetic analysis, a minimum of 11 neuro-developmental genes (RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZFHX1B, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4) are known to harbor rare, high-penetrance mutations that confer a large risk to the bearer. In addition, two other genes (RET, NRG1) harbor common, low-penetrance polymorphisms that contribute only partially to risk and can act as genetic modifiers. To broaden this search, we examined whether a set of 67 proven and candidate HSCR genes harbored additional modifier alleles. In this pilot study, we utilized a custom-designed array CGH with ∼33,000 test probes at an average resolution of ∼185 bp to detect gene-sized or smaller copy number variants (CNVs) within these 67 genes in 18 heterogeneous HSCR patients. Using stringent criteria, we identified CNVs at three loci (MAPK10, ZFHX1B, SOX2) that are novel, involve regulatory and coding sequences of neuro-developmental genes, and show association with HSCR in combination with other congenital anomalies. Additional CNVs are observed under relaxed criteria. Our research suggests a role for CNVs in HSCR and, importantly, emphasizes the role of variation in regulatory sequences. A much larger study will be necessary both for replication and for identifying the full spectrum of small CNV effect.
ine the specific gene expression in B-cell lymphoma subtypes, we compared expression profiles of cell lines from transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL), Epstein-Barr virus-negative (EBV(-)) Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and EBV(+)BL. Complementary DNAs were synthesized from these cell lines and hybridized with the Atlas Human 1.2 Array membrane. Hierarchical clustering analysis based upon the levels of 43 genes highlighted characteristic expression patterns of the 3 lymphoma subtypes. Genes expressed at higher levels in tFL than EBV(-)BL and EBV(+)BL included calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CAMK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10). EBV(-)BL was characterized by high-level expression of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), heat shock 27 kD protein 1 (HSPB1) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1 (MADH1). Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FGR) was the most significant gene to delineate EBV(+)BL. A subtype prediction algorithm using 34 genes correctly classified 22 (92%) of 24 lymphomas into FL/tFL, EBV(-)BL or EBV(+)BL. By comparison with normal reference B-cell materials, the expression patterns of the selected genes were characteristic of lymphomas. We extended the clustering analysis to cell lines from de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The DLBCL cell lines were either separated from the former 3 lymphoma subtypes or segregated with EBV(+)BL, possibly reflecting variable genetic abnormalities. The associations of CAMK1 with tFL, APP and MADH1 with EBV(-)BL, FGR with EBV(+)BL, and BCL2 with tFL and DLBCL were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction assays. This study has provided new molecular markers, expressions of which are closely associated with B-cell lymphoma subtype.
ells are the main source of paracrine support to motor neurons. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been correlated to motor neuron death in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Despite the involvement of Schwann cells in early neuromuscular disruption in ALS, detailed molecular events of a dying-back triggering are unknown. Sciatic nerves of presymptomatic (60-day-old) SOD1(G93A) mice were submitted to a high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis. DAVID demonstrated the deregulated genes related to death, stress and mitochondrion, which allowed the identification of Cell cycle, ErbB signaling, Tryptophan metabolism and Rig-I-like receptor signaling as the most representative KEGG pathways. The protein-protein interaction networks based upon deregulated genes have identified the top hubs (TRAF2, H2AFX, E2F1, FOXO3, MSH2, NGFR, TGFBR1) and bottlenecks (TRAF2, E2F1, CDKN1B, TWIST1, FOXO3). Schwann cells were enriched from the sciatic nerve of presymptomatic mice using flow cytometry cell sorting. qPCR showed the up regulated (Ngfr, Cdnkn1b, E2f1, Traf2 and Erbb3, H2afx, Cdkn1a, Hspa1, Prdx, Mapk10) and down-regulated (Foxo3, Mtor) genes in the enriched Schwann cells. In conclusion, molecular analyses in the presymptomatic sciatic nerve demonstrated the involvement of death, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial pathways in the Schwann cell non-autonomous mechanisms in the early stages of AL.
 dimension of the Columbian Exchange entailed substantial genetic admixture between ancestral source populations from Africa, the Americas and Europe, which had evolved separately for many thousands of years. We sought to address the implications of the creation of admixed American genomes, containing novel allelic combinations, for human health and fitness via analysis of an admixed Colombian population from Medellin. Colombian genomes from Medellin show a wide range of three-way admixture contributions from ancestral source populations. The primary ancestry component for the population is European (average = 74.6%, range = 45.0%-96.7%), followed by Native American (average = 18.1%, range = 2.1%-33.3%) and African (average = 7.3%, range = 0.2%-38.6%). Locus-specific patterns of ancestry were evaluated to search for genomic regions that are enriched across the population for particular ancestry contributions. Adaptive and innate immune system related genes and pathways are particularly over-represented among ancestry-enriched segments, including genes (HLA-B and MAPK10) that are involved in defense against endemic pathogens such as malaria. Genes that encode functions related to skin pigmentation (SCL4A5) and cutaneous glands (EDAR) are also found in regions with anomalous ancestry patterns. These results suggest the possibility that ancestry-specific loci were differentially retained in the modern admixed Colombian population based on their utility in the New World environmen.

s (RAD001, Afinitor(®)) is an oral, selective mTOR inhibitor recently approved by the US-FDA in combination with exemestane for treatment of hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer. To date, no molecular predictors of response to everolimus in breast cancer have been identified. We hypothesized predictive markers could be identified using preclinical models. Using a molecularly characterized panel of human breast cancer and immortalized breast epithelial cell lines, we determined sensitivity to everolimus alone or in combination with ER- or HER2- targeted therapy. Gene expression microarrays and comparative genomic hybridization were performed on the cell lines to identify predictors of response to everolimus. Among 13 everolimus-sensitive cell lines, 10/13(77 %) were luminal, while in 26 resistant cell lines, 16/26(62 %) were non-luminal, and 10/26(38 %) were luminal. Only 3/24 non-luminal lines were sensitive, two of which were HER2+. Everolimus enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of both tamoxifen (TAM) and fulvestrant (FUL) in ER+ breast cancer cell lines, as well as trastuzumab in HER2+ cell lines. Everolimus + FUL but not everolimus + TAM reversed acquired resistance to TAM. Everolimus inhibited mTOR in tested cell lines by decreasing S6 phosphorylation, mediating its anti-proliferative effect by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Chromosomal amplifications of AURKA (p value = 0.04) and HER2 (p value = 0.03) were each associated with increased sensitivity to everolimus. Transcript expression microarrays identified GSK3A, PIK3R3, KLF8, and MAPK10 among the genes overexpressed in sensitive luminal lines, while PGP, RPL38, GPT, and GFAP were among the genes overexpressed in resistant luminal cell lines. These preclinical in vitro data provide further support for continued clinical development of everolimus in luminal (ER+ or HER2+) breast cancer in combination with targeted therapies. We identified several potential molecular markers associated with response to everolimus that will require validation in clinical materia.
creening has the potential to accelerate and reduce costs of probe development and drug discovery. To develop and benchmark virtual screening methods, validation data sets are commonly used. Over the years, such data sets have been constructed to overcome the problems of analogue bias and artificial enrichment. With the rapid growth of public domain databases containing high-throughput screening data, such as the PubChem BioAssay database, there is an increased possibility to use such data for validation. In this study, we identify PubChem data sets suitable for validation of both structure- and ligand-based virtual screening methods. To achieve this, high-throughput screening data for which a crystal structure of the bioassay target was available in the PDB were identified. Thereafter, the data sets were inspected to identify structures and data suitable for use in validation studies. In this work, we present seven data sets (MMP13, DUSP3, PTPN22, EPHX2, CTDSP1, MAPK10, and CDK5) compiled using this method. In the seven data sets, the number of active compounds varies between 19 and 369 and the number of inactive compounds between 59 405 and 337 634. This gives a higher ratio of the number of inactive to active compounds than what is found in most benchmark data sets. We have also evaluated the screening performance using docking and 3D shape similarity with default settings. To characterize the data sets, we used physicochemical similarity and 2D fingerprint searches. We envision that these data sets can be a useful complement to current data sets used for method evaluatio.
tudied the effects of cell communication on human beta cell function and resistance to cytotoxicity using the novel human insulin-secreting cell line 1.1B4 configured as monolayers and pseudoislets. Incubation with the incretin gut hormones GLP-1 and GIP caused dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from 1.1B4 cell monolayers and pseudoislets. The secretory responses were 1.5-2.7-fold greater than monolayers. Cell viability (MTT), DNA damage (comet assay) and apoptosis (acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining) were investigated following 2-h exposure of 1.1B4 monolayers and pseudoislets to ninhydrin, H2O2, streptozotocin, glucose, palmitate or cocktails of proinflammatory cytokines. All agents tested decreased viability and increased DNA damage and apoptosis in both 1.1B4 monolayers and pseudoislets. However, pseudoislets exhibited significantly greater resistance to cytotoxicity (1.5-2.7-fold increases in LD50) and lower levels of DNA damage (1.3-3.4-fold differences in percentage tail DNA and olive tail moment) and apoptosis (1.3-1.5-fold difference) compared to monolayers. Measurement of gene expression by reverse-transcription, real-time PCR showed that genes involved with insulin secretion (INS, PDX1, PCSK1, PCSK2, GLP1R and GIPR), cell-cell communication (GJD2, GJA1 and CDH1) and antioxidant defence (SOD1, SOD2, GPX1 and CAT) were significantly upregulated in pseudoislets compared to monolayers, whilst the expression of proapoptotic genes (NOS2, MAPK8, MAPK10 and NFKB1) showed no significant differences. In summary, these data indicate cell-communication associated with three-dimensional islet architecture is important both for effective insulin secretion and for protection of human beta cells against cytotoxicit.
tude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening form of non-cardiogenic edema which occurs in unacclimatized but otherwise normal individuals within two to four days after rapid ascent to altitude beyond 3000 m. The precise pathoetiology and inciting mechanisms regulating HAPE remain unclea.
med global gene expression profiling in individuals with established HAPE compared to acclimatized individuals. Our data suggests concurrent modulation of multiple pathways which regulate vascular homeostasis and consequently lung fluid dynamics. These pathways included those which regulate vasoconstriction through smooth muscle contraction, cellular actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and endothelial permeability/dysfunction. Some notable genes within these pathways included MYLK; rho family members ARGEF11, ARHGAP24; cell adhesion molecules such as CLDN6, CLDN23, PXN and VCAM1 besides other signaling intermediates. Further, several important regulators of systemic/pulmonary hypertension including ADRA1D, ECE1, and EDNRA were upregulated in HAPE. We also observed significant upregulation of genes involved in paracrine signaling through chemokines and lymphocyte activation pathways during HAPE represented by transcripts of TNF, JAK2, MAP2K2, MAP2K7, MAPK10, PLCB1, ARAF, SOS1, PAK3 and RELA amongst others. Perturbation of such pathways can potentially skew vascular homeostatic equilibrium towards altered vascular permeability. Additionally, differential regulation of hypoxia-sensing, hypoxia-response and OXPHOS pathway genes in individuals with HAPE were also observe.
reveals specific components of the complex molecular circuitry underlying HAPE. We show concurrent perturbation of multiple pathways regulating vascular homeostasis and suggest multi-genic nature of regulation of HAP.
associated with higher incidence of heart failure and death following myocardial infarction (MI). The molecular and cellular changes that lead to these worse outcomes are not know.
 aging mice underwent induction of MI by LAD ligation. There was a significant increase in mortality in the aging mice. Neither the young nor aging hearts after MI had inducible ventricular tachycardia. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis increases early after MI in young and aging mice, but to a much greater degree in the aging mice. Caspase inhibition with Ac-DEVD-CHO resulted in a 61% reduction in activated caspase-3 and an 84% reduction in apoptosis in cardiomyocytes in young mice (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), but not in aging mice. Gene pathway profiling demonstrated activation of both the caspase and Map3k1/Mapk10 pathways in aging mice following MI, which may contribute to their resistance to caspase inhibitio.
rts activate distinct apoptotic pathways have more cardiomyocyte apoptosis and are resistant to antiapoptotic therapies following MI. Novel or combination approaches may be required to improve outcomes in aging patients following M.
tudy, three kinds of phenothiazine drugs were analyzed to explore their potential antitumor mechanisms. First, target proteins that could interact with chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and trifluoperazine were predicted. Then, the target proteins of the three drugs were intersected. Cell signaling pathway enrichment and related disease enrichment were conducted for the intersected proteins to extract the enrichment categories associated with tumors. By regulation network analysis of the protein interactions, the mechanisms of action of these target proteins in tumor tissue were clarified, thus confirming the potential antitumor mechanisms of the phenothiazine drugs. The final results of cell signaling pathway enrichment and related disease enrichment showed that the categories with the highest score were all found in tumors. Target proteins belonging to the tumor category included signaling pathway members such as Wnt, MAPK and retinoic acid receptor. Moreover, another target protein, MAPK8, could indirectly act on target proteins CDK2, IGF1R, GSK3B, RARA, FGFR2 and MAPK10, thereby affecting tumor cell division and proliferation. Therefore, phenothiazine drugs may have potential antitumor effects, and tumor-associated target proteins play important roles in the process of cell signaling transduction cascade.
ion of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a kind of disease with physical barriers and neurological disorders. The objective of this study was to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OPLL patient ligament cells and identify the target sites for the prevention and treatment of OPLL in clinic. Gene expression data GSE5464 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus; then DEGs were screened by limma package in R language, and changed functions and pathways of OPLL cells compared to normal cells were identified by DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery); finally, an interaction network of DEGs was constructed by string. A total of 1536 DEGs were screened, with 31 down-regulated and 1505 up-regulated genes. Response to wounding function and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway may involve in the development of OPLL. Genes, such as PDGFB, PRDX2 may involve in OPLL through response to wounding function. Toll-like receptor signaling pathway enriched genes such as TLR1, TLR5, and TLR7 may involve in spine cord injury in OPLL. PIK3R1 was the hub gene in the network of DEGs with the highest degree; INSR was one of the most closely related genes of it. OPLL related genes screened by microarray gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analysis may be helpful for elucidating the mechanism of OPL.
recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a handful of variants with best significance for coronary artery disease (CAD), it remains a challenge to summarize the underlying biological information from the abundant genotyping data. Here, we propose an integrated network analysis that effectively combines GWAS genotyping dataset, protein-protein interaction (PPI) database, literature and pathway annotation information. This three-step approach was illustrated for a comprehensive network analysis of CAD as the following. First, a network was constructed from PPI database and CAD seed genes mined from the available literatures. Then, susceptibility network modules were captured from the results of gene-based association tests. Finally, susceptibility modules were annotated with potential mechanisms for CAD via the KEGG pathway database. Our network analysis identified four susceptibility modules for CAD including a complex module that consisted of 15 functional inter-connected sub-modules, AGPAT3-AGPAT4-PPAP2B module, ITGA11-ITGB1 module and EMCN-SELL module. MAPK10 and COL4A2 among the top-scored focal adhesion pathway related module were the most significant genes (MAPK10: OR=32.5, P=3.5 × 10(-11); COL4A2: OR=2.7, P=2.8 × 10(-10)). The significance of the two genes were further validated by other two gene-based association tests (MAPK10: P=0.009 and 0.007; COL4A2: P=0.001 and 0.023) and another independent GWAS dataset (MAPK10: P=0.001; COL4A2: P=0.0004). Furthermore, 34 out of 44 previously reported CAD susceptibility genes were captured by our CAD PPI network and 17 of them were also significant genes. The susceptibility modules identified in our study might provide novel clues for the clarification of CAD pathogenesis in the futur.
de association studies (GWAS) have revealed numerous associations between many phenotypes and gene candidates. Frequently, however, further elucidation of gene function has not been achieved. A recent GWAS identified 69 candidate genes associated with elevated liver enzyme concentrations, which are clinical markers of liver disease. To investigate the role of these genes in liver homeostasis, we narrowed down this list to 12 genes based on zebrafish orthology, zebrafish liver expression and disease correlation. To assess the function of gene candidates during liver development, we assayed hepatic progenitors at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf) and hepatocytes at 72 hpf using in situ hybridization following morpholino knockdown in zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of three genes (pnpla3, pklr and mapk10) decreased expression of hepatic progenitor cells, whereas knockdown of eight genes (pnpla3, cpn1, trib1, fads2, slc2a2, pklr, mapk10 and samm50) decreased cell-specific hepatocyte expression. We then induced liver injury in zebrafish embryos using acetaminophen exposure and observed changes in liver toxicity incidence in morphants. Prioritization of GWAS candidates and morpholino knockdown expedites the study of newly identified genes impacting liver development and represents a feasible method for initial assessment of candidate genes to instruct further mechanistic analyses. Our analysis can be extended to GWAS for additional disease-associated phenotype.
ine the profiles of differential expression of genes and micro (mi)RNAs in patients with alcoholic hepatiti.
 was extracted from peripheral blood samples of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and control individuals. Microarrays were utilized to detect genes and miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups. The significance level (P-values) and false discovery rate were assessed with a random variance model. Node genes and key miRNAs were identified and analyzed to determine the roles of various molecular networks and processes in disease pathogenesi.
f 1123 genes and 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The node genes modulating disease-related networks were: MAPK10, RAP1A, ADCY8, CBL, and SOCS1. The key miRNAs were: hsa-miR-570, hsa-miR-29, chsa-miR-1228*, hsa-miR-99a*, hsa-miR-1299, and hsa-miR-32.
 hepatitis patients show differential expression of genes involved in a broad range of biological processes, including apoptosis, immune response, activity of cancer genes, cell cycle and glutathione metabolism. This disease-related profile of gene expression provides valuable insights into the pathogenic process and may help future efforts to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for alcoholic hepatiti.
tive detection and management of muscle-invasive bladder Transition Cell Carcinoma (TCC) continues to be an urgent clinical challenge. While some differences of gene expression and function in papillary (Ta), superficial (T1) and muscle-invasive (≥T2) bladder cancers have been investigated, the understanding of mechanisms involved in the progression of bladder tumors remains incomplete. Statistical methods of pathway-enrichment, cluster analysis and text-mining can extract and help interpret functional information about gene expression patterns in large sets of genomic data. The public availability of patient-derived expression microarray data allows open access and analysis of large amounts of clinical data. Using these resources, we investigated gene expression differences associated with tumor progression and muscle-invasive TCC. Gene expression was calculated relative to Ta tumors to assess progression-associated differences, revealing a network of genes related to Ras/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways with increased expression. Further, we identified genes within this network that are similarly expressed in superficial Ta and T1 stages but altered in muscle-invasive T2 tumors, finding 7 genes (COL3A1, COL5A1, COL11A1, FN1, ErbB3, MAPK10 and CDC25C) whose expression patterns in muscle-invasive tumors are consistent in 5 to 7 independent outside microarray studies. Further, we found increased expression of the fibrillar collagen proteins COL3A1 and COL5A1 in muscle-invasive tumor samples and metastatic T24 cells. Our results suggest that increased expression of genes involved in mitogenic signaling may support the progression of muscle-invasive bladder tumors that generally lack activating mutations in these pathways, while expression changes of fibrillar collagens, fibronectin and specific signaling proteins are associated with muscle-invasive disease. These results identify potential biomarkers and targets for TCC treatments, and provide an integrated systems-level perspective of TCC pathobiology to inform future studie.
tely 10% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) overexpress the cytokine receptor subunit CRLF2, which may confer a poor prognosis. CRLF2 binds its ligand thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a heterodimer with IL7R. Subsets of CRLF2-overexpressing B-ALLs also have a gain-of-function CRLF2 F232C mutation or activating mutations in JAK2. Whether these mutant alleles confer differences in signaling has not been addressed. Through a domain mutation analysis, we demonstrate a distinct dependence on the CRLF2 intracellular tyrosine Y368 in signaling by CRLF2 F232C, but not signaling induced by TSLP or through CRLF2/mutant JAK2. In contrast, CRLF2 signaling in each context is strictly dependent on both the CRLF2 box1 domain and the intracellular tryptophan W286. Using a global quantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by TSLP, we previously identified TSLP-induced phosphorylation of multiple kinases implicated in B-cell receptor signaling, including Lyn, Btk, Hck, Syk, MAPK8, MAPK9, and MAPK10. We now demonstrate that cells dependent on CRLF2/mutant JAK2 have reduced phosphorylation at these targets, suggesting that the kinases promote TSLP-mediated proliferation but serve as negative regulators of CRLF2/mutant JAK2 signaling. Thus, targetable nodes downstream of CRLF2 differ based on the presence or absence of additional mutations in CRLF2 signaling component.
e 4q deletion syndrome (4q- syndrome) is a rare condition, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000. Although variable, the clinical spectrum commonly includes craniofacial, developmental, digital, skeletal, and cardiac involvement. Data on the genotype-phenotype correlation within the 4q arm are limited. We present detailed clinical and genetic information by array CGH on 20 patients with 4q deletions. We identified a patient who has a ∼465 kb deletion (186,770,069-187,234,800, hg18 coordinates) in 4q35.1 with all clinical features for 4q deletion syndrome except for developmental delay, suggesting that this is a critical region for this condition and a specific gene responsible for orofacial clefts and congenital heart defects resides in this region. Since the patients with terminal deletions all had cleft palate, our results provide further evidence that a gene associated with clefts is located on the terminal segment of 4q. By comparing and contrasting our patients' genetic information and clinical features, we found significant genotype-phenotype correlations at a single gene level linking specific phenotypes to individual genes. Based on these data, we constructed a hypothetical partial phenotype-genotype map for chromosome 4q which includes BMP3, SEC31A, MAPK10, SPARCL1, DMP1, IBSP, PKD2, GRID2, PITX2, NEUROG2, ANK2, FGF2, HAND2, and DUX4 gene.
c β-cell dysfunction is central to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Prolonged elevated levels of circulating free-fatty acids and hyperglycemia, also termed glucolipotoxicity, mediate β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis associated with increased c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activity. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress are elicited by palmitate and high glucose concentrations further potentiating JNK activity. Our aim was to determine the role of the JNK subtypes JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 in palmitate and high glucose-induced β-cell apoptosis. We established insulin-producing INS1 cell lines stably expressing JNK subtype specific shRNAs to understand the differential roles of the individual JNK isoforms. JNK activity was increased after 3 h of palmitate and high glucose exposure associated with increased expression of ER and mitochondrial stress markers. JNK1 shRNA expressing INS1 cells showed increased apoptosis and cleaved caspase 9 and 3 compared to non-sense shRNA expressing control INS1 cells when exposed to palmitate and high glucose associated with increased CHOP expression, ROS formation and Puma mRNA expression. JNK2 shRNA expressing INS1 cells did not affect palmitate and high glucose induced apoptosis or ER stress markers, but increased Puma mRNA expression compared to non-sense shRNA expressing INS1 cells. Finally, JNK3 shRNA expressing INS1 cells did not induce apoptosis compared to non-sense shRNA expressing INS1 cells when exposed to palmitate and high glucose but showed increased caspase 9 and 3 cleavage associated with increased DP5 and Puma mRNA expression. These data suggest that JNK1 protects against palmitate and high glucose-induced β-cell apoptosis associated with reduced ER and mitochondrial stres.
the natural medium of molecules in the cell and plays an important role in protein structure, function and interaction with small molecule ligands. However, the widely used molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method for binding energy calculation does not explicitly take account of water molecules that mediate key protein-ligand interactions. We have developed a protocol to include water molecules that mediate ligand-protein interactions as part of the protein structure in calculation of MM/PBSA binding energies (a method we refer to as water-MM/PBSA) for a series of JNK3 kinase inhibitors. Improved correlation between water-MM/PBSA binding energies and experimental IC50 values was obtained compared to that obtained from classical MM/PBSA binding energy. This improved correlation was further validated using sets of neuraminidase and avidin inhibitors. The observed improvement, however, appears to be limited to systems in which there are water-mediated ligand-protein hydrogen bond interactions. We conclude that the water-MM/PBSA method performs better than classical MM/PBSA in predicting binding affinities when water molecules play a direct role in mediating ligand-protein hydrogen bond interaction.
arrestins bind dozens of non-receptor partners, the interaction sites for most signaling proteins remain unknown. Here we report the identification of arrestin-3 elements involved in binding MAP kinase JNK3α2. Using purified JNK3α2 and MBP fusions containing separated arrestin-3 domains and peptides exposed on the non-receptor-binding surface of arrestin-3 we showed that both domains bind JNK3α2 and identified one element on the N-domain and two on the C-domain that directly interact with JNK3α2. Using in vitro competition we confirmed that JNK3α2 engages identified N-domain element and one of the C-domain peptides in the full-length arrestin-3. The 25-amino acid N-domain element has the highest affinity for JNK3α2, suggesting that it is the key site for JNK3α2 docking. The identification of elements involved in protein-protein interactions paves the way to targeted redesign of signaling proteins to modulate cell signaling in desired ways. The tools and methods developed here to elucidate the molecular mechanism of arrestin-3 interactions with JNK3α2 are suitable for mapping of arrestin-3 sites involved in interactions with other partner.
ity of all mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is stimulated via phosphorylation by upstream MAPK kinases (MAPKK), which are in their turn activated via phosphorylation by MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs). The cells ensure the specificity of signaling in these cascades by employing a variety of scaffolding proteins that bind matching MAPKKKs, MAPKKs, and MAPKs. All four vertebrate arrestin subtypes bind JNK3, but only arrestin-3 serves as a scaffold, promoting JNK3 activation in intact cells. Arrestin-3-mediated JNK3 activation does not depend on arrestin-3 interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as demonstrated by the ability of some arrestin mutants that cannot bind receptors to activate JNK3, whereas certain mutants with enhanced GPCR binding fail to promote JNK3 activation. Recent findings suggest that arrestin-3 directly binds both MAPKKs necessary for JNK activation and facilitates JNK3 phosphorylation at both Thr (by MKK4) and Tyr (by MKK7). JNK3 is expressed in a limited set of cell types, whereas JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms are as ubiquitous as arrestin-3. Recent study showed that arrestin-3 facilitates the activation of JNK1 and JNK2, scaffolding MKK4/7-JNK1/2/3 signaling complexes. In all cases, arrestin-3 acts by bringing the kinases together: JNK phosphorylation shows biphasic dependence on arrestin-3, being enhanced at lower and suppressed at supraoptimal concentrations. Thus, arrestin-3 regulates the activity of multiple JNK isoforms, suggesting that it might play a role in survival and apoptosis of all cell type.
s is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine and has been proven beneficial for many aspects of human health. It is important to explore the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of astragalus injection in cerebral ischemia reperfusion injur.
 cerebral ischemic model with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion was established by Longa's method in healthy adult male Wistar rats, and treated by injecting intraperitoneally astragalus injection (3&nbsp;ml/kg). The neurobehavioral function of rats was evaluated by Longa's test. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry and the cerebral infarct volume was calculated by tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain. The shape and structure of neurons in parahippocampal area was observed by HE stain and the neuronal apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and flow cytometry. The expressions of c-jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) mRNA and protein were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical assay and Western blotting respectivel.
atment with astragalus injection, the expressions of JNK3 mRNA and protein reduced significantly, the number of neuronal apoptosis minus, the cerebral infarct volume shrink, the neuronal shape-structure and animal neurobehavioral function improved significantly than those in model rat.
gested that astragalus injection could inhibit neuronal apoptosis, reduce infarct volume and improve neurobehavioral function by down-regulating the expression of JNK3 gene after cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in rat.
ns in microtubule motor transport are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Post-translational modification of the cargo-binding domain of the light and heavy chains of kinesin has been shown to regulate transport, but less is known about how modifications of the motor domain affect transport. Here we report on the effects of phosphorylation of a mammalian kinesin motor domain by the kinase JNK3 at a conserved serine residue (Ser-175 in the B isoform and Ser-176 in the A and C isoforms). Phosphorylation of this residue has been implicated in Huntington disease, but the mechanism by which Ser-175 phosphorylation affects transport is unclear. The ATPase, microtubule-binding affinity, and processivity are unchanged between a phosphomimetic S175D and a nonphosphorylatable S175A construct. However, we find that application of force differentiates between the two. Placement of negative charge at Ser-175, through phosphorylation or mutation, leads to a lower stall force and decreased velocity under a load of 1 piconewton or greater. Sedimentation velocity experiments also show that addition of a negative charge at Ser-175 favors the autoinhibited conformation of kinesin. These observations imply that when cargo is transported by both dynein and phosphorylated kinesin, a common occurrence in the cell, there may be a bias that favors motion toward the minus-end of microtubules. Such bias could be used to tune transport in healthy cells when properly regulated but contribute to a disease state when misregulate.
3 was previously shown to bind JNK3α2, MKK4, and ASK1. However, full JNK3α2 activation requires phosphorylation by both MKK4 and MKK7. Using purified proteins we show that arrestin-3 directly interacts with MKK7 and promotes JNK3α2 phosphorylation by both MKK4 and MKK7 in vitro as well as in intact cells. The binding of JNK3α2 promotes an arrestin-3 interaction with MKK4 while reducing its binding to MKK7. Interestingly, the arrestin-3 concentration optimal for scaffolding the MKK7-JNK3α2 module is ∼10-fold higher than for the MKK4-JNK3α2 module. The data provide a mechanistic basis for arrestin-3-dependent activation of JNK3α2. The opposite effects of JNK3α2 on arrestin-3 interactions with MKK4 and MKK7 is the first demonstration that the kinase components in mammalian MAPK cascades regulate each other's interactions with a scaffold protein. The results show how signaling outcomes can be affected by the relative expression of scaffolding proteins and components of signaling cascades that they assembl.
damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase triggers multiple events to promote cell survival and facilitate repair. If damage is excessive, ATM stimulates cytokine secretion to alert neighboring cells and apoptosis to eliminate the afflicted cell. ATM augments cell survival by activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB; however, how ATM induces cytokine production and apoptosis remains elusive. Here we uncover a p53-independent mechanism that transmits ATM-driven cytokine and caspase signals upon strong genotoxic damage. Extensive DNA lesions stimulated two sequential NF-κB activation phases, requiring ATM and NEMO/IKK-γ: The first phase induced TNF-α-TNFR1 feedforward signaling, promoting the second phase and driving RIP1 phosphorylation. In turn, RIP1 kinase triggered JNK3/MAPK10-dependent interleukin-8 secretion and FADD-mediated proapoptotic caspase-8 activation. Thus, in the context of excessive DNA damage, ATM employs NEMO and RIP1 kinase through autocrine TNF-α signaling to switch on cytokine production and caspase activation. These results shed light on cell-fate regulation by AT.
ponse factor (SRF) is an obligatory transcription factor, required for the formation of vertebrate mesoderm leading to the origin of the cardiovascular system. Protein A-TEV-tagged chromatin immunoprecipitation technology was used to collect direct SRF-bound gene targets from pluripotent P19 cells, induced by Me2SO treatment into an enriched cardiac cell population. From 242 sequenced DNA fragments, we identified 188 genomic DNA fragments as potential direct SRF targets that contain CArG boxes and CArG-like boxes. Of the 92 contiguous genes that were identified, a subgroup of 43 SRF targets was then further validated by co-transfection assays with SRF. Expression patterns of representative candidate genes were compared with the LacZ reporter expression activity of the endogenous SRF gene. According to the Unigene data base, 84% of the SRF target candidates were expressed, at least, in the heart. In SRF null embryonic stem cells, 81% of these SRF target candidates were greatly affected by the absence of SRF. Among these SRF-regulated genes, Raf1, Map4k4, and Bicc1 have essential roles in mesoderm formation. The 12 regulated SRF target genes, Mapk10 (JNK3), Txnl2, Azi2, Tera, Sema3a, Lrp4, Actc1, Myl3, Hspg2, Pgm2, Hif3a, and Asb5, have been implicated in cardiovascular formation, and the Ski and Hes6 genes have roles in muscle differentiation. SRF target genes related to cell mitosis and cycle, E2f5, Npm1, Cenpb, Rbbp6, and Scyl1, expressed in the heart tissue were differentially regulated in SRF null ES cell.
he uncontested role of p53 in cycle arrest/cell death after cisplatin treatment, to date the question whether wild-type p53 confers a resistant or sensitive status on the cell is still a matter of debate. Isogenic and isophenotypic human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell line variants for p53 differently expressed cycle genes after cisplatin treatment. Seven genes (CDC6-related protein, CCNC, GAS1, TFDP2, MAPK10/JNK3, WEE1, RPA1) selected after expression on an Atlas human cell cycle array were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. While cisplatin treatment increased their expression in p53 wild-type cells it decreased it in cells with inactivated p53 and had no or less effect on cells with mutated p53. These results show that in a well-defined system, different alterations of p53 can lead to a different regulation of genes and hence to either resistance or sensitivity to cisplatin. Moreover for the first time, MAPK10/JNK3 was identified in human thyroid cells and tissue. Four of the genes (CDC6-related protein, CCNC, GAS1 and TFDP2) were decreased in human papillary carcinoma tissues. Relevance of these genes (especially a decrease in GAS1 in thyroid papillary carcinoma) in various malignant pathologies has already been shown. These genes may be explored as new markers in advanced thyroid cancer such as metastatic and anaplastic forms displaying p53 alteration.
ctivated protein (MAP) kinases are proline-directed, serine/threonine kinases that respond to a variety of extracellular signals. A subgroup of these kinases, stress-activated protein (SAP) kinases, phosphorylate c-jun in response to cellular stress. Using monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3F12, we have cloned and partially characterized p493F12 kinase, a mouse homologue of the rat SAP beta kinase and described its expression in the adult and developing mouse. Unlike previously reported MAP and SAP kinases, it is primarily expressed as a 2.7 kb transcript in neurons in the nervous system of the adult mouse. A 2.4 kb transcript is also expressed in the testis. Immunocytochemically, MAb 3F12 decorates a loop-like structure encircling the nucleus in the cytoplasm of neurons in the adult brain, and distinct perinuclear dots in the embryos. In situ hybridization first reveals expression in post-mitotic neurons, on embryonic day 11. The mRNA is also expressed in the Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cell line and is not upregulated in response to differentiating agents. The neuronal specificity of this kinase suggests the presence of a signal transduction cascade unique to neurons. As the amino acid sequence is highly conserved in the human and mouse, the latter may serve as a model for regulation and expression of this kinas.
l antibody 3F12 identifies a cytoplasmic antigen of 49 kDa in human hippocampus and neocortex. The distribution of 3F12 immunoreactive neurons closely matches that of Alzheimer's disease (AD) targeted neurons in these areas. In some hippocampal neurons of AD patients, this antigen colocalizes with ALZ-50, indicating the presence of AD pathology in these neurons. Molecular characterization of the 3F12 cDNA revealed it to be a member of the MAP kinase family, showing 43% amino acid sequence identity to human extracellular related kinase 2 (p42mapk). We have confirmed that p493F12 kinase autophosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues, as expected for a MAP kinase. The p49 mRNA is expressed exclusively in the nervous system. In the brain, the distribution of these neurons closely corresponds to 3F12 antigen-bearing neurons. The p493F12 gene maps to the human chromosome 21q21 region, a region that may be important in the pathogenesis of AD and Down's syndrom.
on of viral nucleic acids leads to type I and type III IFN gene expression and activation of host antiviral responses. At present, type III IFN genes are the least well-characterized IFN types. Here, we demonstrate that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in regulating IFN-λ1 gene expression in response to various types of RNA molecules in human moDCs. Inhibition of p38 MAPK strongly reduced IFN gene expression, and overexpression of p38α MAPK enhanced IFN-λ1 gene expression in RNA-stimulated moDCs. The regulation of IFN gene expression by p38 MAPK signaling was independent of protein synthesis and thus, a direct result of RNA stimulation. Moreover, the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS-IRF3 pathway was required for p38α MAPK to up-regulate IFN-λ1 promoter activation, whereas the MyD88-IRF7 pathway was not needed, and the regulation was not involved directly in IRF7-dependent IFN-α1 gene expression. The stimulatory effect of p38α MAPK on IFN-λ1 mRNA expression in human moDCs did not take place directly via the activating TBK1/IKKε complex, but rather, it occurred through some other parallel pathways. Furthermore, mutations in ISRE and NF-κB binding sites in the promoter region of the IFN-λ1 gene led to a significant reduction in p38α MAPK-mediated IFN responses after RNA stimulation. Altogether, our data suggest that the p38α MAPK pathway is linked with RLR signaling pathways and regulates the expression of early IFN genes after RNA stimulation cooperatively with IRF3 and NF-κB to induce antiviral responses furthe.
en-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory protein that is activated in response to cellular stress. While p38 is known to be activated in response to cerebral ischemia, the precise role of p38 and its isoforms in ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis remains unclear. In the current study, we examined the differential activation and functional roles of p38α and p38β MAPK isoforms in short-term ovariectomized female rats treated with either the neuroprotective ovarian hormone 17beta-estradiol (E2) or placebo in a model of global cerebral ischemia (GCI). GCI induced biphasic activation of total p38 in the hippocampal CA1, with peaks at 30 min and 1 day after 10-min ischemia-reperfusion. Further study demonstrated that activated p38α, but not p38β, translocated to the nucleus 30 min and 3 h post reperfusion, and that this event coincided with increased phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a p38 target protein. Intriguingly, activated p38α was also enhanced in mitochondrial fractions of CA1 neurons 1 day after GCI, and there was loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as enhanced cytochrome c release and caspase-3 cleavage at 2 days post GCI. Importantly, E2 prevented the biphasic activation of p38, as well as both nuclear and mitochondrial translocation of p38α after GCI, and these findings correlated with attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction and delayed neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1. Furthermore, administration of a p38 inhibitor was able to mimic the neuroprotective effects of E2 in the hippocampal CA1 region by preventing nuclear and mitochondrial translocation of p38α, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and neuronal apoptosis. As a whole, this study suggests that changes in subcellular localization of the activated p38α isoform are required for neuronal apoptosis following GCI, and that E2 exerts robust neuroprotection, in part, through dual inhibition of activation and subcellular trafficking of p38.
ed understanding of the molecular pathways that drive tooth morphogenesis and enamel secretion is needed to generate teeth from organ cultures for therapeutic implantation or to determine the pathogenesis of primary disorders of dentition (Abdollah, S., Macias-Silva, M., Tsukazaki, T., Hayashi, H., Attisano, L., and Wrana, J. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 27678-27685). Here we present a novel ectodermal dysplasia phenotype associated with conditional deletion of p38α MAPK in ectodermal appendages using K14-cre mice (p38α(K14) mice). These mice display impaired patterning of dental cusps and a profound defect in the production and biomechanical strength of dental enamel because of defects in ameloblast differentiation and activity. In the absence of p38α, expression of amelogenin and β4-integrin in ameloblasts and p21 in the enamel knot was significantly reduced. Mice lacking the MAP2K MKK6, but not mice lacking MAP2K MKK3, also show the enamel defects, implying that MKK6 functions as an upstream kinase of p38α in ectodermal appendages. Lastly, stimulation with BMP2/7 in both explant culture and an ameloblast cell line confirm that p38α functions downstream of BMPs in this context. Thus, BMP-induced activation of the p38α MAPK pathway is critical for the morphogenesis of tooth cusps and the secretion of dental ename.
t interactions of a popular immunosuppressant Cyclosporine A (CSA) with several proteins besides its molecular target, cyclophilin A, are implicated in the activation of signaling pathways that lead to numerous side effects of this dru.
uctural human proteome and a novel algorithm for inverse ligand binding prediction, ILbind, we determined a comprehensive set of 100+ putative partners of CSA. We empirically show that predictive quality of ILbind is better compared with other available predictors for this compound. We linked the putative target proteins, which include many new partners of CSA, with cellular functions, canonical pathways and toxicities that are typical for patients who take this drug. We used complementary approaches (molecular docking, molecular dynamics, surface plasmon resonance binding analysis and enzymatic assays) to validate and characterize three novel CSA targets: calpain 2, caspase 3 and p38 MAP kinase 14. The three targets are involved in the apoptotic pathways, are interconnected and are implicated in nephrotoxicit.
can be used to predict drug effects and generate hypotheses around alternative indications. To support Losmapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor in development for acute coronary syndrome, we characterized gene variation in MAPK11/14 genes by exome sequencing and follow-up genotyping or imputation in participants well-phenotyped for cardiovascular and metabolic trait.
tion of genetic variation in MAPK11 and MAPK14 genes using additive genetic models in linear or logistic regression with cardiovascular, metabolic, and biomarker phenotypes highlighted an association of RS2859144 in MAPK14 with myeloperoxidase in a dyslipidemic population (Genetic Epidemiology of Metabolic Syndrome Study), P=2.3×10(-6)). This variant (or proxy) was consistently associated with myeloperoxidase in the Framingham Heart Study and Cardiovascular Health Study studies (replication meta-P=0.003), leading to a meta-P value of 9.96×10(-7) in the 3 dyslipidemic groups. The variant or its proxy was then profiled in additional population-based cohorts (up to a total of 58 930 subjects) including Cohorte Lausannoise, Ely, Fenland, European Prospective Investigation of Cancer, London Life Sciences Prospective Population Study, and the Genetics of Obesity Associations study obesity case-control for up to 40 cardiovascular and metabolic traits. Overall analysis identified the same single nucleotide polymorphisms to be nominally associated consistently with glomerular filtration rate (P=0.002) and risk of obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2), P=0.004.
eroxidase is a prognostic marker of coronary events, the MAPK14 variant may provide a mechanistic link between p38 map kinase and these events, providing information consistent with current indication of Losmapimod for acute coronary syndrome. If replicated, the association with glomerular filtration rate, along with previous biological findings, also provides support for kidney diseases as alternative indication.
 on a quantitative study of small molecule binding kinetics on protein microarrays with plasmonic-based electrochemical impedance microscopy (P-EIM). P-EIM measures electrical impedance optically with high spatial resolution by converting a surface charge change to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) image intensity change, and the signal is not scaled to the mass of the analyte. Using P-EIM, we measured binding kinetics and affinity between small molecule drugs (imatinib and SB202190) and their target proteins (kinases Abl1 and p38-α). The measured affinity values are consistent with reported values measured by an indirect competitive binding assay. We also found that SB202190 has weak bindings to ABL1 with KD &gt; 10 μM, which is not reported in the literature. Furthermore, we found that P-EIM is less prone to nonspecific binding, a long-standing issue in SPR. Our results show that P-EIM is a novel method for high-throughput measurement of small molecule binding kinetics and affinity, which is critical to the understanding of small molecules in biological systems and discovery of small molecule drug.
l cancer (CRC) remains one of the most common malignancies in the world. Although surgical resection combined with adjuvant therapy is effective at the early stages of the disease, resistance to conventional therapies is frequently observed in advanced stages, where treatments become ineffective. Resistance to cisplatin, irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy has been shown to involve mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and recent studies identified p38α MAPK as a mediator of resistance to various agents in CRC patients. Studies published in the last decade showed a dual role for the p38α pathway in mammals. Its role as a negative regulator of proliferation has been reported in both normal (including cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, fibroblasts, hematopoietic and lung cells) and cancer cells (colon, prostate, breast, lung tumor cells). This function is mediated by the negative regulation of cell cycle progression and the transduction of some apoptotic stimuli. However, despite its anti-proliferative and tumor suppressor activity in some tissues, the p38α pathway may also acquire an oncogenic role involving cancer related-processes such as cell metabolism, invasion, inflammation and angiogenesis. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the predominant role of the p38α MAPK pathway in CRC development and chemoresistance. In our view, this might help establish the therapeutic potential of the targeted manipulation of this pathway in clinical setting.
nisms underlying lipotoxic/diabetic cardiomyopathy remain poorly understood. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) levels, elevated in obesity and type 2 diabetes, induce apoptosis in many cell types including cardiomyocytes. Signaling pathways, including the p38α mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathway, have been implicated in apoptosis due to a diverse range of insult.
 the hypothesis that SFA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is dependent on p38α activatio.
lt ventricular cardiomyocytes (AC16 cells) were exposed to high physiological levels of palmitate (PA), a SFA. The apoptotic response was measured using annexin-V by flow cytometry, and the p38α-dependent pathway was evaluated using a p38 inhibitor PD169316, and by p38α small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. PA exposure for 16 h dose-dependently increased apoptosis in AC16 cardiomyocytes (control: 2.6±0.6%, 150 μM PA: 3.5±0.9%, 300 μM PA: 11.5±1.6%, n=4, p&lt;0.01). PA did not change total p38α protein levels, but increased p38α phosphorylation dose-dependently (n=5, p&lt;0.01). PD169316 tended to reduce PA-induced apoptosis (n=4, p=0.05). Specific p38α siRNA markedly reduced the expression of p38α but not p38β (n=3, p&lt;0.0001), and dose-dependently attenuated PA-induced apoptosis (control siRNA: 7.7±1.0%, 300 μM PA: 34.4±5.0%, 300 μM PA+30 pmol siRNA: 23.7±4.4%, 300 μM PA+60 pmol siRNA: 19.7±2.6%, 300 μM PA+120 pmol siRNA: 17.3±2.8%, n=4, p&lt;0.0001.
ults demonstrate that PA induces p38α activation, and reducing p38α expression attenuates PA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Our results support a potential mechanism by which high plasma SFA levels through p38α activation may lead to the development of lipotoxic/diabetic cardiomyopath.
dystrophies are a group of genetic diseases that lead to muscle wasting and, in most cases, premature death. Cytokines and inflammatory factors are released during the disease process where they promote deleterious signaling events that directly participate in myofiber death. Here, we show that p38α, a kinase in the greater mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling network, serves as a nodal regulator of disease signaling in dystrophic muscle. Deletion of Mapk14 (p38α-encoding gene) in the skeletal muscle of mdx- (lacking dystrophin) or sgcd- (δ-sarcoglycan-encoding gene) null mice resulted in a significant reduction in pathology up to 6 months of age. We also generated MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6) muscle-specific transgenic mice to model heightened p38α disease signaling that occurs in dystrophic muscle, which resulted in severe myofiber necrosis and many hallmarks of muscular dystrophy. Mechanistically, we show that p38α directly induces myofiber death through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway involving direct phosphorylation and activation of the pro-death Bcl-2 family member Bax. Indeed, muscle-specific deletion of Bax, but not the apoptosis regulatory gene Tp53 (encoding p53), significantly reduced dystrophic pathology in the muscles of MKK6 transgenic mice. Moreover, use of a p38 MAPK pharmacologic inhibitor reduced dystrophic disease in Sgcd(-/-) mice suggesting a future therapeutic approach to delay diseas.
 (BBR), a component from traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to possess anti-tumor activity against a wide spectrum of cancer cells including human lung cancer, but the detailed mechanism underlining this has not been well elucidate.
tudy, the effect of berberine on cell growth and apoptosis were assessed by MTT, flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining assays. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, and expressions of p38 MAPK isoforms α and β, total ERK1/2, p53, FOXO3a and p21 protein were evaluated by Western Blot analysis. Silencing of p38 MAPK isoform α and β, p53, FOXO3a and p21 were performed by siRNA methods. Exogenous expression of FOXO3a was carried out by electroporated transfection assay.
 that BBR significantly inhibited growth and induced cell cycle arrest of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in the G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that BBR increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 in a time-dependent and induced protein expression of tumor suppressor p53 and transcription factor FOXO3a in a dose-dependent fashion. The specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580), and silencing of p38α MAPK by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), but not ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) blocked the stimulatory effects of BBR on protein expression of p53 and FOXO3a. Interestingly, inhibition of p53 using one specific inhibitor (Pifithrin-α) and silencing of p53 using siRNAs overcome the inhibitory effect of BBR on cell growth. Silencing of FOXO3a appeared to attenuate the effect of BBR on p53 expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, BBR induces the protein expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CIP1/WAF1), which was not observed in cells silencing of p53 or FOXO3α gene. Intriguingly, exogenous expression of FOXO3a enhanced the expression of p21 (CIP1/WAF1) and strengthened BBR-induced apoptosi.
ts show that BBR inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of NSCLC cells through activation of p38α MAPK signaling pathway, followed by induction of the protein expression of p53 and FOXO3a. The latter contribute to the BBR-increased p21 (CIP1/WAF1) protein expression. The exogenous FOXO3a, interaction and mutually exclusive events of p53 and FOXO3a augment the overall response of BB.
e growth factor (HGF) is a paracrine factor involved in organogenesis, tissue repair, and wound healing. We report here that HGF promotes osteogenic differentiation through the transcription of key osteogenic markers, including osteocalcin, osterix, and osteoprotegerin in human mesenchymal stem cells and is a necessary component for the establishment of osteoblast mineralization. Blocking endogenous HGF using PHA665752, a c-Met inhibitor (the HGF receptor), or an HGF-neutralizing antibody attenuates mineralization, and PHA665752 markedly reduced alkaline phosphatase activity. Moreover, we report that HGF promotion of osteogenic differentiation involves the rapid phosphorylation of p38 and differential regulation of its isoforms, p38α and p38β. Western blot analysis revealed a significantly increased level of p38α and p38β protein, and reverse transcription quantitative PCR revealed that HGF increased the transcriptional level of both p38α and p38β. Using small interfering RNA to reduce the transcription of p38α and p38β, we saw differential roles for p38α and p38β on the HGF-induced expression of key osteogenic markers. In summary, our data demonstrate the importance of p38 signaling in HGF regulation of osteogenic differentiatio.
en-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase MK5 is a substrate of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, ERK3 and ERK4. Cell culture and animal studies have demonstrated that MK5 is involved in tumour suppression and promotion, embryogenesis, anxiety, cell motility and cell cycle regulation. In the present study, homology models of MK5 were used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of: (1) MK5 alone; (2) MK5 in complex with an inhibitor; and (3) MK5 in complex with the interaction partner p38α. The calculations showed that the inhibitor occupied the active site and disrupted the intramolecular network of amino acids. However, intramolecular interactions consistent with an inactive protein kinase fold were not formed. MD with p38α showed that not only the p38 docking region, but also amino acids in the activation segment, αH helix, P-loop, regulatory phosphorylation region and the C-terminal of MK5 may be involved in forming a very stable MK5-p38α complex, and that p38α binding decreases the residual fluctuation of the MK5 model. Electrostatic Potential Surface (EPS) calculations of MK5 and p38α showed that electrostatic interactions are important for recognition and bindin.
rticularly mechano-sensitive musculoskeletal cells such as tenocytes, routinely encounter oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can not only stimulate tissue repair, but also cause damage leading to tissue degeneration. As diabetes is associated with increased oxidative damage as well as increased risk of tendon degeneration, the aim of this study was to determine if extracellular glucose levels alter the response of tendon cells to oxidative stress. Primary human tenocytes were cultured in either high (17.5 mM) or low (5 mM) glucose and treated with 100 μM hydrogen peroxide. In low glucose, peroxide-treated cells remained fully viable and collagen synthesis was increased, suggesting an anabolic response. In high glucose, however, peroxide treatment led to increased bim-mediated apoptosis. The activities of both forkhead box O (FOXO1) and p53 were required for upregulation of bim RNA expression in high glucose. We found that both p53-mediated inhibition of the bim repressor micro RNA (miR17-92) and FOXO1-mediated upregulation of bim transcription were required to permit accumulation of bim RNA. High glucose coupled with oxidative stress resulted in upregulation of miR28-5p, which directly inhibited expression of the p53 deacetylase sirtuin 3, resulting in increased levels of acetylated p53. In peroxide-treated cells in both high and low glucose, protein levels of acetylated FOXO1 as well as HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) were increased. However, under low-glucose conditions, peroxide treatment resulted in activation of p38, which inhibited FOXO1-mediated but promoted HIF1α-mediated transcriptional activity. In low glucose, HIF1α upregulated expression of sox9 and scleraxis, two critical transcription factors involved in establishing the tenocyte phenotype, and increased collagen synthesis. The switch from FOXO1-mediated (proapoptosis) to HIF1α-mediated (prodifferentiation) transcription occurred at an extracellular glucose concentration of 7 mM, a concentration equivalent to the maximum normal blood glucose concentration. Extracellular glucose has a profound effect on the cellular response to oxidative stress. A level of oxidative stress normally anabolic may be pathological in high glucos.
 kinase inhibitor SKF86002 lacks intrinsic fluorescence but becomes fluorescent upon binding to the ATP-binding sites of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α). It was found that co-crystals of this compound with various kinases were distinguishable by their strong fluorescence. The co-crystals of SKF86002 with p38α, Pim1, ASK1, HCK and AMPK were fluorescent. Addition of SKF86002, which binds to the ATP site, to the co-crystallization solution of HCK promoted protein stability and thus facilitated the production of crystals that otherwise would not grow in the apo form. It was further demonstrated that the fluorescence of SKF86002 co-crystals can be applied to screen for candidate kinase inhibitors. When a compound binds competitively to the ATP-binding site of a kinase crystallized with SKF86002, it displaces the fluorescent SKF86002 and the crystal loses its fluorescence. Lower fluorescent signals were reported after soaking SKF86002-Pim1 and SKF86002-HCK co-crystals with the inhibitors quercetin, a quinazoline derivative and A-419259. Determination of the SKF86002-Pim1 and SKF86002-HCK co-crystal structures confirmed that SKF86002 interacts with the ATP-binding sites of Pim1 and HCK. The structures of Pim1-SKF86002 crystals soaked with the inhibitors quercetin and a quinazoline derivative and of HCK-SKF86002 crystals soaked with A-419259 were determined. These structures were virtually identical to the deposited crystal structures of the same complexes. A KINOMEscan assay revealed that SKF86002 binds a wide variety of kinases. Thus, for a broad range of kinases, SKF86002 is useful as a crystal marker, a crystal stabilizer and a marker to identify ligand co-crystals for structural analysi.
muscle aging results in a gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle function and regenerative capacity, which can lead to sarcopenia and increased mortality. Although the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia remain unclear, the skeletal muscle stem cell, or satellite cell, is required for muscle regeneration. Therefore, identification of signaling pathways affecting satellite cell function during aging may provide insights into therapeutic targets for combating sarcopenia. Here, we show that a cell-autonomous loss in self-renewal occurs via alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, p38α and p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in satellite cells from aged mice. We further demonstrate that pharmacological manipulation of these pathways can ameliorate age-associated self-renewal defects. Thus, our data highlight an age-associated deregulation of a satellite cell homeostatic network and reveal potential therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of progressive muscle wastin.
s are the most abundant glial cell in the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) and optic nerve head (ONH), and perform essential roles in maintaining retinal ganglion cell (RGC) detoxification and homeostasis. Mature astrocytes are relatively quiescent, but rapidly undergo a phenotypic switch in response to insult, characterized by upregulation of intermediate filament proteins, loss of glutamate buffering, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased antioxidant production. These changes result in both positive and negative influences on RGCs. However, the mechanism regulating these responses is still unclear, and pharmacologic strategies to modulate select aspects of this switch have not been thoroughly explored. Here we describe a system for rapid culture of mature astrocytes from the adult rat retina that remain relatively quiescent, but respond robustly when challenged with oxidative damage, a key pathogenic stress associated with inner retinal injury. When primary astrocytes were exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) we consistently observed characteristic changes in activation markers, along with increased expression of detoxifying genes, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. This in vitro model was then used for a pilot chemical screen to target specific aspects of this switch. Increased activity of p38α and β Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) were identified as a necessary signal regulating expression of MnSOD, and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), with consequent changes in ROS-mediated injury. Additionally, multiplex cytokine profiling detected p38 MAPK-dependent secretion of IL-6, MCP-1, and MIP-2α, which are proinflammatory signals recently implicated in damage to the inner retina. These data provide a mechanism to link increased oxidative stress to proinflammatory signaling by astrocytes, and establish this assay as a useful model to further dissect factors regulating the reactive switc.
r of large-scale high-dimensional datasets recording different aspects of a single disease is growing, accompanied by a need for frameworks that can create one coherent model from multiple tensors of matched columns, e.g., patients and platforms, but independent rows, e.g., probes. We define and prove the mathematical properties of a novel tensor generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), which can simultaneously find the similarities and dissimilarities, i.e., patterns of varying relative significance, between any two such tensors. We demonstrate the tensor GSVD in comparative modeling of patient- and platform-matched but probe-independent ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) tumor, mostly high-grade, and normal DNA copy-number profiles, across each chromosome arm, and combination of two arms, separately. The modeling uncovers previously unrecognized patterns of tumor-exclusive platform-consistent co-occurring copy-number alterations (CNAs). We find, first, and validate that each of the patterns across only 7p and Xq, and the combination of 6p+12p, is correlated with a patient's prognosis, is independent of the tumor's stage, the best predictor of OV survival to date, and together with stage makes a better predictor than stage alone. Second, these patterns include most known OV-associated CNAs that map to these chromosome arms, as well as several previously unreported, yet frequent focal CNAs. Third, differential mRNA, microRNA, and protein expression consistently map to the DNA CNAs. A coherent picture emerges for each pattern, suggesting roles for the CNAs in OV pathogenesis and personalized therapy. In 6p+12p, deletion of the p21-encoding CDKN1A and p38-encoding MAPK14 and amplification of RAD51AP1 and KRAS encode for human cell transformation, and are correlated with a cell's immortality, and a patient's shorter survival time. In 7p, RPA3 deletion and POLD2 amplification are correlated with DNA stability, and a longer survival. In Xq, PABPC5 deletion and BCAP31 amplification are correlated with a cellular immune response, and a longer surviva.
AP kinases (p38 MAPKs) represent an important family centrally involved in mediating extracellular signaling. Recent studies indicate that family members such as MAPK13 (p38δ) display a selective cellular and tissue expression and are therefore involved in specific diseases. Detailed structural studies of all p38 MAPK family members are crucial for the design of specific inhibitors. In order to facilitate such ventures, the structure of MAPK13 was determined in both the inactive (unphosphorylated; MAPK13) and active (dual phosphorylated; MAPK13/pTpY) forms. Here, the first preparation, crystallization and structure determination of MAPK13/pTpY are presented and the structure is compared with the previously reported structure of MAPK13 in order to facilitate studies for structure-based drug design. A comprehensive analysis of inactive versus active structures for the p38 MAPK family is also presented. It is found that MAPK13 undergoes a larger interlobe configurational rearrangement upon activation compared with MAPK14. Surprisingly, the analysis of activated p38 MAPK structures (MAP12/pTpY, MAPK13/pTpY and MAPK14/pTpY) reveals that, despite a high degree of sequence similarity, different side chains are used to coordinate the phosphorylated residues. There are also differences in the rearrangement of the hinge region that occur in MAPK14 compared with MAPK13 which would affect inhibitor binding. A thorough examination of all of the active (phosphorylated) and inactive (unphosphorylated) p38 MAPK family member structures was performed to reveal a common structural basis of activation for the p38 MAP kinase family and to identify structural differences that may be exploited for developing family member-specific inhibitor.
ed cells, not many mitochondria are degraded by mitophagy induced by physiological cellular stress. We observed mitophagy in HeLa cells using a method that relies on the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein Keima. With this approach, we found that mitophagy was barely induced by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone treatment, which is widely used as an inducer of PARK2/Parkin-related mitophagy, whereas a small but modest amount of mitochondria were degraded by mitophagy under conditions of starvation or hypoxia. Mitophagy induced by starvation or hypoxia was marginally suppressed by knockdown of ATG7 and ATG12, or MAP1LC3B, which are essential for conventional macroautophagy. In addition, mitophagy was efficiently induced in Atg5 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, knockdown of RAB9A and RAB9B, which are essential for alternative autophagy, but not conventional macroautophagy, severely suppressed mitophagy. Finally, we found that the MAPKs MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK14/p38 were required for mitophagy. Based on these findings, we conclude that mitophagy in mammalian cells predominantly occurs through an alternative autophagy pathway, requiring the MAPK1 and MAPK14 signaling pathway.
formation and subsequent anterior-posterior (A-P) axis elongation are fundamental aspects of gastrulation, which is initiated by formation of the primitive streak (PS). Convergent extension (CE) movements and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are important for A-P axis elongation in vertebrate embryos. The evolutionarily conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway regulates CE, and Wnts regulate many aspects of gastrulation including CE and EMT. However, the Wnt ligands that regulate A-P axis elongation in mammalian development remain unknown. Wnt11 and Wnt5a regulate axis elongation in lower vertebrates, but only Wnt5a, not Wnt11, regulates mammalian PCP signaling and A-P axis elongation in development. Here, by generating Wnt5a; Wnt11 compound mutants, we show that Wnt11 and Wnt5a play redundant roles during mouse A-P axis elongation. Both genes regulate trunk notochord extension through PCP-controlled CE of notochord cells, establishing a role for Wnt11 in mammalian PCP. We show that Wnt5a and Wnt11 are required for proper patterning of the neural tube and somites by regulating notochord formation, and provide evidence that both genes are required for the generation and migration of axial and paraxial mesodermal precursor cells by regulating EMT. Axial and paraxial mesodermal precursors ectopically accumulate in the PS at late gastrula stages in Wnt5a(-/-); Wnt11(-/-) embryos and these cells ectopically express epithelial cell adhesion molecules. Our data suggest that Wnt5a and Wnt11 regulate EMT by inducing p38 (Mapk14) phosphorylation. Our findings provide new insights into the role of Wnt5a and Wnt11 in mouse early development and also in cancer metastasis, during which EMT plays a crucial rol.
abetes (T2D) is characterized as hyperglycaemia caused by defects in insulin secretion, and it affects target tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue. Therefore, analyzing the changes of gene expression profiles in these tissues is important to elucidate the pathogenesis of T2D. We, therefore, measured the gene transcript alterations in liver and skeletal muscle of rat with induced T2D, to detect differentially expressed genes in liver and skeletal muscle and perform gene-annotation enrichment analysi.
esent study, skeletal muscle and liver tissue from 10 streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and 10 control rats were analyzed using gene expression microarrays. KEGG pathways enriched by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by WebGestalt Expander and GATHER software. DEGs were validated by the method of real-time PCR and western blo.
9,929 expressed genes across the genome, 1,305 and 997 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, P&lt;0.01) were identified in comparisons of skeletal muscle and liver, respectively. Large numbers of DEGs (200) were common in both comparisons, which was clearly more than the predicted number (131 genes, P&lt;0.001). For further interpretation of the gene expression data, three over-representation analysis softwares (WebGestalt, Expander and GATHER) were used. All the tools detected one KEGG pathway (MAPK signaling) and two GO (gene ontology) biological processes (response to stress and cell death), with enrichment of DEGs in both tissues. In addition, PPI (protein-protein interaction) networks constructed using human homologues not only revealed the tendency of DEGs to form a highly connected module, but also suggested a &quot;hub&quot; role of p38-MAPK-related genes (such as MAPK14) in the pathogenesis of T2.
ts indicated the considerably aberrant MAPK signaling in both insulin-sensitive tissues of T2D rat, and that the p38 may play a role as a common &quot;hub&quot; in the gene module response to hyperglycaemia. Furthermore, our research pinpoints the role of several new T2D-associated genes (such as Srebf1 and Ppargc1) in the human populatio.
s can reduce fertility and development in livestock, notably in pigs and poultry, although the effect of most mycotoxins on reproductive function in cattle has not been established. One major mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol (DON), not only targets immune cells and activates the ribotoxic stress response (RSR) involving MAPK activation, but also inhibits oocyte maturation in pigs. In this study, we determined the effect of DON on bovine granulosa cell function using a serum-free culture system. Addition of DON inhibited estradiol and progesterone secretion, and reduced levels of mRNA encoding estrogenic (CYP19A1) but not progestogenic (CYP11A1 and STAR) proteins. Cell apoptosis was increased by DON, which also increased FASLG mRNA levels. The mechanism of action of DON was assessed by western blotting and PCR experiments. Addition of DON rapidly and transiently increased phosphorylation of MAPK3/1, and resulted in a more prolonged phosphorylation of MAPK14 (p38) and MAPK8 (JNK). Activation of these pathways by DON resulted in time- and dose-dependent increases in abundance of mRNA encoding the transcription factors FOS, FOSL1, EGR1, and EGR3. We conclude that DON is deleterious to granulosa cell function and acts through a RSR pathwa.
 and senescence have been described as central features of cell biology, but the interplay between these mechanisms remains obscure. Using a therapeutically relevant model of DNA damage-induced senescence in human glioma cells, we demonstrated that acute treatment with temozolomide induces DNA damage, a transitory activation of PRKAA/AMPK-ULK1 and MAPK14/p38 and the sustained inhibition of AKT-MTOR. This produced a transient induction of autophagy, which was followed by senescence. However, at the single cell level, this coordinated transition was not observed, and autophagy and senescence were triggered in a very heterogeneous manner. Indeed, at a population level, autophagy was highly negatively correlated with senescence markers, while in single cells this correlation did not exist. The inhibition of autophagy triggered apoptosis and decreased senescence, while its activation increased temozolomide-induced senescence, showing that DNA damage-induced autophagy acts by suppressing apoptosi.
in (OPN; also known as Secreted Phosphoprotein 1, SPP1) is a secreted extra-cellular matrix (ECM) protein that binds to a variety of cell surface integrins to stimulate cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion and communication. It is generally accepted that OPN interacts with apically expressed integrin receptors on the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) and conceptus trophectoderm to attach the conceptus to the uterus for implantation. Research conducted with pigs and sheep has significantly advanced understanding of the role(s) of OPN during implantation through exploitation of the prolonged peri-implantation period of pregnancy when elongating conceptuses are free within the uterine lumen requiring extensive paracrine signaling between conceptus and endometrium. This is followed by a protracted and incremental attachment cascade of trophectoderm to uterine LE during implantation, and development of a true epitheliochorial or synepitheliochorial placenta exhibited by pigs and sheep, respectively. In pigs, implanting conceptuses secrete estrogens which induce the synthesis and secretion of OPN in adjacent uterine LE. OPN then binds to αvβ6 integrin receptors on trophectoderm, and the αvβ3 integrin receptors on uterine LE to bridge conceptus attachment to uterine LE for implantation. In sheep, implanting conceptuses secrete interferon tau that prolongs the lifespan of CL. Progesterone released by CL then induces OPN synthesis and secretion from the endometrial GE into the uterine lumen where OPN binds integrins expressed on trophectoderm (αvβ3) and uterine LE (identity of specific integrins unknown) to adhere the conceptus to the uterus for implantation. OPN binding to the αvβ3 integrin receptor on ovine trophectoderm cells induces in vitro focal adhesion assembly, a prerequisite for adhesion and migration of trophectoderm, through activation of: 1) P70S6K via crosstalk between FRAP1/MTOR and MAPK pathways; 2) MTOR, PI3K, MAPK3/MAPK1 (Erk1/2) and MAPK14 (p38) signaling to stimulate trohectoderm cell migration; and 3) focal adhesion assembly and myosin II motor activity to induce migration of trophectoderm cells. Further large in vivo focal adhesions assemble at the uterine-placental interface of both pigs and sheep and identify the involvement of sizable mechanical forces at this interface during discrete periods of trophoblast migration, attachment and placentation in both specie.
cal role of microRNAs in cancer development has been extensively described. miRNAs are both specific markers and putative therapy targets. miR-155 has been identified to be an oncomiRNA and is highly expressed in several solid cancers, including glioblastoma. In this study, we found that miR-155 is a good potential therapy target. Knockdown of miR-155 sensitizes glioma cells to the chemotherapy of temozolomide (TMZ) by targeting the p38 isoforms mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 [MAPK13, also known as p38 MAPKδ or stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4)] and MAPK14 (also known as p38 MAPKα). As tumor suppressor genes, MAPK13 and MAPK14 play important roles in lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing cell apoptosis, and slowing the progression of cancer. Knockdown of miR-155 enhanced the anticancer effect of TMZ on glioma by targeting the MAPK13 and MAPK14-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis, but did not affect the secretion of MMP2 and MMP.
f this study was to evaluate the osteoprotective effect of aqueous Rhizoma Dioscoreae extract (RDE) on the alveolar bone of rats with ovariectomy-induced bone los.
star rats were subjected to either ovariectomy or a sham operation (SHAM). The ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with vehicle (OVX) or RDE by oral gavage or with 17β-estradiol (E2) subcutaneously. After treatments, the bone mineral density (BMD), the three-dimensional bone architecture of the alveolar bone and the plasma biomarkers of bone turnover were analyzed to assess bone metabolism, and the histomorphometry of the alveolar bone was observed. Microarrays were used to evaluate gene expression profiles in alveolar bone from RDE-treated and OVX rats. The differential expression of genes was further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The key findings were verified using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR.
ts showed that RDE inhibited alveolar bone loss in OVX rats. Compared to the OVX rats, the RDE-treated rats showed upregulated expression levels of 207 genes and downregulated expression levels of 176 genes in the alveolar bone. The IPA showed that several genes had the potential to code for proteins that were involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wnt7a, Fzd2, Tcf3, Spp1, Frzb, Sfrp2 and Sfrp4) and the p38 MAPK signaling pathway (Il1rn and Mapk14.
eriments revealed that RDE could inhibit ovariectomy-induced alveolar bone loss in rats. The mechanism of this anti-osteopenic effect in alveolar bone may be involved in the reduced abnormal bone remodeling, which is associated with the modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin and the p38 MAPK signaling pathways via gene regulatio.
senescence, leading to cell death through prevention of regular cell renewal, is associated with the upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p16(INK4a). While this mechanism has been described as leading to progressive nephron loss, p16(INK4a) upregulation in renal cell carcinoma has been linked to a disease-specific improved patient survival rate. While in both conditions endothelin-1 is also upregulated, the signaling pathway connecting ET-1 to p16(INK4a) has not been characterized until this stud.
ure, qRT-PCR, Western Blot, immunoprecipitation (IP), proximity ligation assay (PLA), and non-radioactive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA.
ant renal proximal tumor cells (Caki-1), an activation of p16(INK4a) and p21(waf1/cip1) was observed. An increased expression of E-26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors was detectable. Using specific antibodies, a complex formation between ETS1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2) was shown. A further complex partner was Mxi2. EMSA with supershift analysis for ETS1 and Mxi2 indicated the involvement of both factors in the protein-DNA interaction. After specifically blocking the endothelin receptors, ETS1 expression was significantly downregulated. However, the endothelin B receptor dependent downregulation was stronger than that of the A receptor. In contrast, primary proximal tubule cells showed a nuclear decrease after ET-1 stimulation. This indicates that other ETS members may be involved in the observed p16(INK4a) upregulation (as described in the literature.
2 and Mxi2 are important complex partners initiating increased p16(INK4a) and p21w(af1/cip1) activation in renal tumor cell.
xtracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are tightly regulated by the cellular microenvironment in which they operate. Mxi2 is a p38α splice isoform capable of binding to ERK1/2 and ensuring their translocation to the nucleus. Therein Mxi2 sustains ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels and, as a consequence, ERK1/2 nuclear signals are enhanced. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still unclear. In the present study, we show that Mxi2 prevents nuclear but not cytoplasmic phosphatases from binding to and dephosphorylating ERK1/2, disclosing an unprecedented mechanism for the spatial regulation of ERK1/2 activation. We also demonstrate that the kinetics of ERK1/2 extranuclear signals can be significantly altered by artificially tethering Mxi2 to the cytoplasm. In this case, Mxi2 abolishes ERK1/2 inactivation by cytoplasmic phosphatases and potentiates ERK1/2 functions at this compartment. These results highlight Mxi2 as a key spatial regulator of ERK1/2 functions, playing a pivotal role in the balance between ERK1/2 nuclear and cytoplasmic signal.
ctivated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a superfamily of cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that transduce many types of extracellular stimuli into cellular responses. p38MAPK is a member of this family with its active form in a diphosphorylated state (p38MAPKdiP). Two strong anti-p38MAPKdiP immunoreactive bands (apparent molecular weight 38 and 34 kDa) were detected by Western blotting in cultured astrocytes. Using a specific antibody and employing immunoprecipitation procedures and SELDI-TOF analysis, the 34 kDa band was found to correspond to Mxi2, a splice variant of p38MAPK; cultured astrocytes therefore express Mxi2. Separate protein extractions of different subcellular fractions, and fluorescent immunovisualisation employing confocal microscopy, showed Mxi2 to have a non-nuclear, cytosolic distribution in the studied cells. ERK1/2, protein whose intracellular distribution is influenced by Mxi2, showed the same cytoplasmic pattern than Mxi.
egulation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases is an essential yet largely unveiled mechanism for ensuring the fidelity and specificity of their signals. Mxi2 is a p38alpha isoform with the ability to bind ERK1/2. Herein we show that Mxi2 has profound effects on ERK1/2 nucleocytoplasmic distribution, promoting their accumulation in the nucleus. Downregulation of endogenous Mxi2 by RNAi causes a marked reduction of ERK1/2 in the nucleus, accompanied by a pronounced decline in cellular proliferation. We demonstrate that Mxi2 functions in nuclear shuttling of ERK1/2 by enhancing the nuclear accumulation of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in the absence of stimulation. This process requires the direct interaction of both proteins and a high-affinity binding of Mxi2 to ERK-binding sites in nucleoporins, In this respect, Mxi2 acts antagonistically to PEA15, displacing it from ERK1/2 complexes. These results point to Mxi2 as a key spatial regulator for ERK1/2 and disclose an unprecedented stimulus-independent mechanism for ERK nuclear impor.
ery extracellular ligand that has been found to play a role in regulating bone biology acts, at least in part, through MAPK pathways. Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about the contribution of MAPKs to osteoblast biology in vivo. Here we report that the p38 MAPK pathway is required for normal skeletogenesis in mice, as mice with deletion of any of the MAPK pathway member-encoding genes MAPK kinase 3 (Mkk3), Mkk6, p38a, or p38b displayed profoundly reduced bone mass secondary to defective osteoblast differentiation. Among the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, we identified TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as MAP3K7) as the critical activator upstream of p38 in osteoblasts. Osteoblast-specific deletion of Tak1 resulted in clavicular hypoplasia and delayed fontanelle fusion, a phenotype similar to the cleidocranial dysplasia observed in humans haploinsufficient for the transcription factor runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Mechanistic analysis revealed that the TAK1-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK axis phosphorylated Runx2, promoting its association with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), which was required to regulate osteoblast genetic programs. These findings reveal an in vivo function for p38beta and establish that MAPK signaling is essential for bone formation in vivo. These results also suggest that selective p38beta agonists may represent attractive therapeutic agents to prevent bone loss associated with osteoporosis and agin.
ped a pharmacophore model for type II inhibitors that was used to guide the construction of a library of kinase inhibitors. Kinome-wide selectivity profiling of the library resulted in the identification of a series of 4-substituted 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines that exhibited potent inhibitory activity against two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), TAK1 (MAP3K7) and MAP4K2, as well as pharmacologically well interrogated kinases such as p38α (MAPK14) and ABL. Further investigation of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) resulted in the identification of potent dual TAK1 and MAP4K2 inhibitors such as 1 (NG25) and 2 as well as MAP4K2 selective inhibitors such as 16 and 17. Some of these inhibitors possess good pharmacokinetic properties that will enable their use in pharmacological studies in vivo. A 2.4 Å cocrystal structure of TAK1 in complex with 1 confirms that the activation loop of TAK1 assumes the DFG-out conformation characteristic of type II inhibitor.
gen-activated protein kinase (p38α) is activated by a variety of mechanisms, including autophosphorylation initiated by TGFβ-activated kinase 1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) during myocardial ischemia and other stresses. Chemical-genetic approaches and coexpression in mammalian, bacterial and cell-free systems revealed that mouse p38α autophosphorylation occurs in cis by direct interaction with TAB1(371-416). In isolated rat cardiac myocytes and perfused mouse hearts, TAT-TAB1(371-416) rapidly activates p38 and profoundly perturbs function. Crystal structures and characterization in solution revealed a bipartite docking site for TAB1 in the p38α C-terminal kinase lobe. TAB1 binding stabilizes active p38α and induces rearrangements within the activation segment by helical extension of the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif, allowing autophosphorylation in cis. Interference with p38α recognition by TAB1 abolishes its cardiac toxicity. Such intervention could potentially circumvent the drawbacks of clinical pharmacological inhibitors of p38 catalytic activit.
dependence of p53 and MDM2 is critical for proper cell survival and cell death and, when altered, can lead to tumorigenesis. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways function in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell growth, migration, differentiation, and death. Here we discovered that transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1 (TAB1), an activator of TAK1 and of p38α, associates with and inhibits the E3 ligase activity of MDM2 toward p53 and its homolog, MDMX. Depletion of TAB1 inhibits MDM2 siRNA-mediated p53 accumulation and p21 induction, partially rescuing cell cycle arrest induced by MDM2 ablation. Interestingly, of several agents commonly used as DNA-damaging therapeutics, only cell death caused by cisplatin is mitigated by knockdown of TAB1. Two mechanisms are required for TAB1 to regulate apoptosis in cisplatin-treated cells. First, p38α is activated by TAB1 to phosphorylate p53 N-terminal sites, leading to selective induction of p53 targets such as NOXA. Second, MDMX is stabilized in a TAB1-dependent manner and is required for cell death after cisplatin treatment. Interestingly TAB1 levels are relatively low in cisplatin-resistant clones of ovarian cells and in ovarian patient's tumors compared with normal ovarian tissue. Together, our results indicate that TAB1 is a potential tumor suppressor that serves as a functional link between p53-MDM2 circuitry and a key MAPK signaling pathwa.
 the adaptor protein (transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1) (TAB1)-mediated non-canonical activation of p38α to limit ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury after an acute myocardial infarction seems to be attractive since TAB1/p38α interaction occurs specifically in very limited circumstances and possesses unique structural basis. However, so far no TAB1/p38α interaction inhibitor has been reported due to the limited knowledge about the interfaces. In this study, we sought to identify key amino acids essential for the unique mode of interaction with computer-guided molecular simulations and molecular docking. After validation of the predicted three-dimensional (3-D) structure of TAB1/p38α complex, we designed several peptides and evaluated whether they could block TAB1/p38α interaction with selectivity. We found that a cell-permeable peptide worked as a selective TAB1/p38α interaction inhibitor and decreased myocardial I/R injury. To our knowledge, this is the first TAB1/p38α interaction inhibito.
en-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38α is a key regulator in many cellular processes, whose activity is tightly regulated by upstream kinases, phosphatases and other regulators. Transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an upstream kinase in p38α signaling, and its full activation requires a specific activator, the TAK1-binding protein (TAB1). TAB1 was also shown to be an inducer of p38α's autophosphorylation and/or a substrate driving the feedback control of p38α signaling. Here we determined the complex structure of the unphosphorylated p38α and a docking peptide of TAB1, which shows that the TAB1 peptide binds to the classical MAPK docking groove and induces long-range conformational changes on p38α. Our structural and biochemical analyses suggest that TAB1 is a reasonable substrate of p38α, yet the interaction between the docking peptide and p38α may not be sufficient to trigger trans-autophosphorylation of p38.
ate pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) is not yet well understood. Recently, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4 and gut microbial flora have been proved as playing important roles in the process of UC. This study was to evaluate the effect of TLR2 and TLR4 monoclonal antibodies on gut microbial flora in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse mode.
ted the effects of the TLR2 and TLR4 monoclonal antibodies on the development of DSS-induced colitis. Clinical symptoms were evaluated by the disease activity index (DAI), while tissue samples were evaluated by histological scoring (HS). Meanwhile, the mucosal mRNA expressions of TLR2, TLR4, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-17 were analyzed by Realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mucosal protein TRAF6, TAB1, P-IKK, P-P38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPL) and c-jun expressions of the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways were analyzed using Western blot. The mucosal nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) was analyzed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Fecal samples were obtained directly from the cecum for microbiological studie.
ns of TLR2 and TLR4 in colonic epithelial cells on DSS-induced colitis were much higher than normal ones. After the treatment with TLR2mAb and TLR4mAb, DAI and HS were decreased significantly. The UC model group showed a conspicuous increase of Escherichia coli and decreases of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. After being treated with TLR2mAb or/and TLR4mAb, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. increased to the normal leve.
nd TLR4mAb can suppress the development of DSS-induced colitis and increase counts of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteri.
 important stress activated protein kinase involved in gene regulation, proliferation, differentiation, and cell death regulation in heart. p38 kinase activity can be induced through canonical pathway via upstream kinases or by noncanonical autophosphorylation. The intracellular p38 kinase activity is tightly regulated and maintained at low level under basal condition. The underlying regulatory mechanism for canonical p38 kinase activation is well-studied, but the regulation of noncanonical p38 autophosphorylation remains poorly understoo.
igated the molecular basis for the regulation of noncanonical p38 autophosphorylation and its potential functional impact in cardiomyocyte.
h proteomic and biochemical tools, we established that heat shock protein (Hsp)90-Cdc37 chaperones are part of the p38alpha signaling complex in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo. The Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone complex interacts with p38 via direct binding between p38 and Cdc37. Cdc37 expression is both sufficient and necessary to suppress noncanonical p38 activation via autophosphorylation at either basal state or under TAB1 (TAK1 binding protein-1) induction. In contrast, Cdc37 expression has no impact on p38 activation by canonical upstream kinase MKK3 or oxidative stress. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibition results in p38 activation via autophosphorylation, and p38 activity contribute to apoptotic cell death induced by Hsp90 inhibitio.
 has revealed a so far uncharacterized function of Hsp90-Cdc37 as an endogenous regulator of noncanonical p38 activit.
studies have revealed that transforming growth factor-beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAB1) interacts with p38alpha and induces p38alpha autophosphorylation. Here, we examine the sequence requirements in TAB1 and p38alpha that drive their interaction. Deletion and point mutations in TAB1 reveal that a proline residue in the C terminus of TAB1 (Pro412) is necessary for its interaction with p38alpha. Furthermore, a cryptic D-domain-like docking site was identified adjacent to the N terminus of Pro412, putting Pro412 in the phi(B)+3 position of the docking site. Through mutational analysis, we found that the previously identified hydrophobic docking groove in p38alpha is involved in this interaction, whereas the CD domain and ED domain are not. Furthermore, chimeric analysis with p38beta (which does not bind to TAB1) revealed a previously unidentified locus of p38alpha comprising Thr218 and Ile275 that is essential for specific binding of p38alpha to TAB1. Converting either of these residues to the corresponding amino acid of p38beta abolishes p38alpha interaction with TAB1. These p38alpha mutants still can be fully activated by p38alpha upstream activating kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, but their basal activity and activation in response to some extracellular stimuli are reduced. Adjacent to Thr218 and Ile275 is a site where large conformational changes occur in the presence of docking-site peptides derived from p38alpha substrates and activators. This suggests that TAB1-induced autophosphorylation of p38alpha results from conformational changes that are similar but unique to those seen in p38alpha interactions with its substrates and activating kinase.
n of dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for their ability to stimulate resting naive T cells in primary immune responses. Previous studies demonstrated that collagen, such as type I collagen, could facilitate DC maturation; however, the basis of collagen-mediated DC maturation remains unclear. Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a nonintegrin collagen receptor constitutively expressed in a variety of epithelial cells, including tumor cells, and is inducible in leukocytes. In this study, we evaluated the role of DDR1 in DC maturation using human monocyte-derived DCs. Two DDR1 isoforms, DDR1a and DDR1b, were expressed in both immature and mature DCs. Activation of DDR1 on immature DCs resulted in their partial maturation; however, DDR1 activation markedly amplified TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs through activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), suggesting the involvement of DDR1b in this process. Activation of DDR1b on differentiated DDR1b-overexpressing THP-1 cells or DDR1 on mature DCs induced the formation of TNFR associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 binding protein 1beta/p38alpha MAPK complex and p38alpha autophosphorylation. Transfection of differentiated DDR1b-overexpressing THP-1 cells with dominant negative TRAF6 completely abrogated DDR1b-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation, indicating a critical role of TRAF6 in DDR1b-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Taken together, our data suggest that DDR1b-collagen interaction augments the maturation of DCs in a tissue microenvironment through a unique TRAF6/TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 binding protein 1beta/p38alpha MAPK signaling cascade and contributes to the development of adaptive immune response.
en-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play an important role in a variety of biological processes. Activation of MAPKs is mediated by phosphorylation on specific regulatory tyrosine and threonine sites. We have recently found that activation of p38alpha MAPK can be carried out not only by its upstream MAPK kinases (MKKs) but also by p38alpha autophosphorylation. p38alpha autoactivation requires an interaction of p38alpha with TAB1 (transforming growth factor-beta-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1). The autoactivation mechanism of p38alpha has been found to be important in cellular responses to a number of physiologically relevant stimuli. Here, we report the characterization of a splicing variant of TAB1, TAB1beta. TAB1 and TAB1beta share the first 10 exons. The 11th and 12th exons of TAB1 were spliced out in TAB1beta, and an extra exon, termed exon beta, downstream of exons 11 and 12 in the genome was used as the last exon in TAB1beta. The mRNA of TAB1beta was expressed in all cell lines examined. The TAB1beta mRNA encodes a protein with an identical sequence to TAB1 except the C-terminal 69 amino acids were replaced with an unrelated 27-amino acid sequence. Similar to TAB1, TAB1beta interacts with p38alpha but not other MAPKs and stimulates p38alpha autoactivation. Different from TAB1, TAB1beta does not bind or activate TAK1. Inhibition of TAB1beta expression with RNA interference in MDA231 breast cancer cells resulted in the reduction of basal activity of p38alpha and invasiveness of MDA231 cells, suggesting that TauAlphaBeta1beta is involved in regulating p38alpha activity in physiological condition.
lation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) on specific tyrosine and threonine sites by MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs) is thought to be the sole activation mechanism. Here, we report an unexpected activation mechanism for p38alpha MAPK that does not involve the prototypic kinase cascade. Rather it depends on interaction of p38alpha with TAB1 [transforming growth factor-beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1] leading to autophosphorylation and activation of p38alpha. We detected formation of a TRAF6-TAB1-p38alpha complex and showed stimulus-specific TAB1-dependent and TAB1-independent p38alpha activation. These findings suggest that alternative activation pathways contribute to the biological responses of p38alpha to various stimul.
0 gene was initially cloned by virtue of its disruption by the translocation breakpoint in some t(10;14) lymphoid neoplasms. LYT-10 is now known to encode a component of the NF-kappaB family of transcriptional activators and has therefore also been designated NFkappaB2. Activation of NF-kappaB is generally associated with its transfer to the nucleus and is followed by a rapid increase in expression of its target genes, which include cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). IL-6 can also be induced by other transcription factors such as NF-IL6. We studied the interaction of IL-1 and these transcription factors in two renal cell carcinoma cell lines (ACHN and Caki-1). These lines produce high levels of IL-6, show endogenous chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity for the IL-6 promoter, and have high basal levels of transcripts encoding the NF-kappaB components Lyt-10, p50, and p65 as well as the NF-IL6 transcription factor. IL-1alpha and IL-1beta markedly increased steady-state levels of LYT-10 (NFkappaB2) transcripts and nuclear Lyt-10 protein in both cell lines. Levels of the NFkappaB1 (p50-encoding), p65, and NF-IL6 transcripts also increased after IL-1 exposure. These changes were accompanied by a 20-fold or greater increase in levels of IL-6 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein. Our observations suggest that the mechanism by which IL-1alpha or IL-1beta induces IL-6 may be mediated through increases in LYT-10 mRNA and protein levels as well as increases in expression of other transcription factors (NFkappaB1, p65, and NF-IL6), in addition to the known ability of IL-1 to post-translationally activate NF-kappa.
dentified a novel human gene on chromosome 10q24 located contiguously to the 3' end of the NFKB2/lyt-10 gene in a tail to tail arrangement. We describe here a cDNA of 4307 bp, isolated from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 71 kDa. Database homology searches indicate that this is a novel gene coding for a putative protein containing two discrete domains with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains, respectively. We named this gene PSD (plekstrin-Sec7 domains gene). Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the presence of three different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately 4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which is expressed only in brain. Our data suggest that the PSD gene may code for a protein related to a recently identified protein family containing both the Sec7 and the PH domains thought to be involved in signaling transduction processe.
2 (Lyt-10) gene codes for an NF-kappaB-related transcription factor containing rel-polyG-ankyrin domains. Rearrangements of the NFKB-2 locus leading to the production of 3' truncated NFKB-2 proteins are recurrently found in lymphoid neoplasms, particularly cutaneous lymphomas. Such mutant NFKB-2 proteins have lost the ability to repress transcription that is typical of NFKB-2 subunit p52, and function as constitutive transcriptional activators. To verify whether the expression of abnormal NFKB-2 proteins can lead to malignant transformations in mammalian cells, we transfected human lymphoblastoid cell lines and murine fibroblasts (Balb/3T3) with expression vectors carrying the cDNAs coding for normal NFKB-2p52, Lyt-10C alpha or LB40 proteins, which are representative of the abnormal types found in lymphoma cases. The expression of both normal and mutant NFKB-2 proteins has a lethal effect on lymphoblastoid cells and a cytotoxic effect was also observed in murine fibroblasts. The fibroblast cell lines expressing Lyt-10C alpha or LB40, but not those expressing normal NFKB-2p52, were capable of forming colonies in soft agar. The analysis of individual clones revealed that cloning efficiency correlated with the expression levels of the abnormal proteins. Injection of the Lyt-10C alpha-transfected Balb cells in SCID mice led to tumor formation in all of the animals, whereas no tumors were observed in the mice injected with control or NFKB-2p52-transfected cells, thus indicating that abnormal NFKB-2 protein expression is tumorigenic in vivo. Our results show that mutant NFKB-2 proteins can lead to the transformed phenotype, and support the hypothesis that alterations in NFKB-2 genes may play a role in lymphomagenesi.
B transcription factors regulate the expression of a variety of genes involved in immune responses and cell growth. In higher vertebrates, the NF-kappa B family encompasses five distinct members. Three NF-kappa B proteins, p65/RelA, RelB, and c-rel/Rel, have high transactivating potential in addition to their DNA binding activity. Two subunits, NF-kappa B1p50 and NF-kappa B2p52, coded respectively by the NFKB1 and NFKB2 genes, may only have DNA binding activity. Moreover, p50 and p52 subunits are translated as precursors, respectively p105 and p100, which can be processed into the mature active forms by the removal of their carboxy-terminal ankyrin domain. The five proteins share a homologous amino-terminal domain (rel domain) involved in DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear transport, and binding of regulatory subunits. All members form homo- and heterodimeric complexes with different DNA binding specificity and transactivating potential. Structural alterations of some members of the NF-kappa B gene family have been observed in lymphoid malignancies. In particular, the NFKB2 gene, localized on chromosome 10q24, represents a candidate proto-oncogene, since it has been found rearranged in certain types of lymphoma and more commonly in cutaneous lymphoma. Molecular analysis indicated that these rearrangements may occur as a consequence of chromosomal translocations or small internal chromosomal deletions. Rearrangements cluster within the carboxy-terminal ankyrin domain of the NFKB2 gene leading to the production of carboxy-terminally truncated proteins which, in some cases, are fused to heterologous protein domains. Experimental data showed that these abnormal proteins are constitutively localized in the nucleus, have lost the transcriptional repressor functions typical of normal NF-kappa B2p52 and may be capable of transactivation activity. These findings suggest that abnormal NFKB2 proteins may contribute to lymphomagenesis by altering the NF-kappa B system, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and leading to the activation of specific subsets of kappa B-controlled gene.
ranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, primary cutaneous lymphomas (CLs) represent a consistent group of B- and T-cell malignancies. We investigated the arrangement of Ig and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, together with the involvement of several oncogenes and the tumor-suppressor gene p53, in a panel of primary cutaneous B- and T-cell lymphomas (CBCLs and CTCLs). Southern blot analysis was performed to detect rearrangements of the Ig, c-myc, bcl-1, bcl-2, bcl-3, bcl-6, and the NFKB2/lyt-10 genes in 52 cases of CBCLs and of the TCR, bcl-3, and NFKB2/lyt-10 genes in 38 cases of CTCLs. tal-1 gene deletions were analyzed in CTCLs by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). p53 gene mutations were assayed using PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct DNA sequencing in CBCL and CTCL cases. Clonal rearrangements of Ig genes or oncogenes were found in 25 of the 52 CBCLs. In particular, we detected rearrangements of the bcl-1 locus (2 cases), the bcl-2 gene (2 cases), the NFKB2/lyt-10 gene (2 cases), and the bcl-6 gene (1 case); interestingly, 4 of these cases showed a germline arrangement of the Ig genes. Clonal rearrangements of TCR genes were detected in 37 of the 38 CTCLs. Rearrangements of the NFKB2/lyt-10 gene were present in 2 cases and tal-1 gene deletions in 3 CTCL cases; p53 gene mutations were detected in 1 CTCL case. Overall, our data indicate that (1) clonal rearrangement of Ig genes is frequently undetectable by means of Southern blot in CBCLs (60%); (2) genetic lesions are involved in a limited but significant fraction of primary CLs showing a molecular marker of clonality (13/62; 20%); and (3) rearrangements of the bcl-1, bcl-2, or bcl-6 loci, associated with specific subsets of nodal lymphoid neoplasias, are rarely observed in CBCLs. Moreover, our results suggest that tal-1 gene deletions may play a pathogenetic role in non-acute T-cell malignancies and that, in the context of lymphoid malignancies, CLs may represent a favorable target for the possible oncogenic potential of the NFKB2/lyt-10 gen.
to clarify the transcriptional regulation of the NFKB2 gene (lyt-10, NF-kappa Bp100), we have characterized the structure and function of its promoter regions. Based on the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones and the 5' flanking genomic region of the NFKB2 gene, RT-PCR analysis in a number of human cell lines demonstrated the presence of two alternative noncoding first exons (1a and 1b). Two distinct promoter regions, P1 and P2, were identified upstream of each exon, containing multiple sites of transcription initiation, as shown by RNase protection analysis. Sequence analysis of these regions showed a CAAT box upstream of exon 1a and high G-C content regions within both P1 and P2. Consensus binding sites for transcription factors, including SP1, AP1 and putative NF-kappa B (kappa B sites), were found upstream of each exon. In particular, six kappa B sites were identified, all but one of them capable of binding NF-kappa B complexes in vitro. Transfection in HeLa cells of plasmids containing P1 and P2 sequences linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene indicated that both P1 and P2 can act independently as promoters. Co-transfection of NF-kappa B effector plasmids (NF-kappa Bp52 and RelA) with a reporter gene linked to P1 and P2 showed that the NFKB2 promoter regions are regulated by NF-kappa B factors. RelA transactivates the NFKB2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas NF-kappa Bp52 acts as a repressor, indicating that the NFKB2 gene may be under the control of a negative feedback regulatory circui.
esent study we investigated the pathogenetic role of c-myc, bcl-2, and lyt-10 oncogenes, bcl-1 locus, and p53 suppressor gene in a representative panel of cutaneous lymphomas, including 25 cases of cutaneous B cell lymphoma (CBCL) and 29 cases of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). In our analysis four cases of CBCL were found rearranged for bcl-2 and two for the bcl-1 locus. Two cases of CTCL and one case of CBCL were found rearranged for lyt-10. No rearrangements of c-myc oncogene were found in CBCL. Analysis of p53 gene showed mutation only in one case of mycosis fungoides in tumoral stage, at codon 163 of p53 gene (TAC--&gt;CAC; Tyr--&gt; Asp). Our data suggest that in primary CBCL bcl-2 oncogenes and bcl-1 locus are rarely involved. Furthermore, in primary CTCL p53 gene is not affected at significant frequency. The occurrence of p53 mutation in a patient affected by mycosis fungoides in tumoral stage may represent an involvement of p53 gene in tumor progression of CTCL, a finding observed in several types of human cance.
(lyt-10) gene codes for a protein that is a member of the NK-kappa B/rel family of transcription factors containing a DNA-binding rel domain and a carboxy-terminal ankyrin-like domain. The NFKB2 gene represents a candidate proto-oncogene, since it has been found to be involved in a chromosomal translocation t(10;14)(q24;q32) in one case of B-cell lymphoma and in gene rearrangements in various types of lymphoid malignancies. To elucidate the structural and functional consequences of NFKB2 rearrangements, we report the molecular characterization of three novel rearranged NFKB2 genes in lymphoid tumors. In one case of multiple myeloma (MM), cloning and sequencing analysis of reciprocal breakpoint sites showed that they occurred within intron 15 of the NFKB2 gene and led to the complete deletion of the 3' portion of the gene coding for the ankyrin domain. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that the novel regions involved in the NFKB2 rearrangement originated from chromosome 7q34, thus implying the occurrence of a t(7;10)(q34;q24) reciprocal chromosomal translocation. In one case of T-cell cutaneous lymphoma (CTCL) and in one of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), NFKB2 rearrangements occurred, respectively, within exons 18 and 20 of the gene and involved recombinations with distinct regions of chromosome 10q24. Molecular analysis suggested that these rearrangements may occur as a consequence of small internal chromosomal deletions. In both of these cases, the rearrangements led to specific carboxy-terminal truncations of NFKB2 generating abnormal transcripts that coded for proteins lacking portions of the ankyrin domain. These proteins localize in the nucleus, suggesting their constitutive activation in vivo. Overall, our results indicate that NFKB2 rearrangements in lymphoid neoplasia may occur by heterogeneous mechanisms, including internal chromosomal deletion or chromosomal translocation. The common consequence of these rearrangements appears to be the deletion of 3' sequences of NFKB2 leading to the production of carboxy-truncated constitutively nuclear proteins that may be involved in tumorigenesi.
B is an inducible transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in immune and inflammation responses and in cellular growth control. Typically, NF-kappa B is localized in the cytoplasm complexed with members of the I kappa B family. The most well characterized form of NF-kappa B is comprised of a heterodimer of a 50 kD (p50/NFKB1) and a 65 kD (p65/RelA) protein. This heterodimeric protein was thought to be primarily responsible for transcriptional regulation of target genes. However, recent studies have led to the identification of other kappa B binding proteins such as c-Rel, RelB and p52 (NFKB2/lyt-10) although their role in gene regulation has been less clear. Here, using gel mobility shift assays as well as a highly sensitive DNA-protein crosslinking assay, we provide evidence for the existence of multiple tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- inducible kappa B binding complexes containing various members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family, namely p50 and p65 as well as the c-Rel and p52 oncoproteins. Dimeric complexes containing various combinations of these proteins appear rapidly in nuclei of TNF-alpha-stimulated cells and include, along with a p50-p65 heterodimer, p50-c-Rel, p65-c-Rel, p52-c-Rel and p52-p65 complexes. The presence of multiple inducible complexes containing distinct combinations of NF-kappa B/Rel family members indicate that specific kappa B responsive genes may be regulated in an NF-kappa B subunit-dependent manne.
2 gene (previously LYT-10, NF-kappa Bp100 or NF-kappa Bp97) codes for a NF-kappa B/rel related protein which is highly homologous to NFKB-1 (previously NF-kappa Bp105) within its rel, poly-glycine and ankyrin domains. The NFKB-2 gene is a candidate proto-oncogene since it is involved in lymphoma-associated chromosomal aberrations. In order to gain insight into the physiological function and role in tumorigenesis of NFKB-2, we have analysed its mechanism of expression and role in transcriptional regulation. We report that, contrary to previous studies, a single 3.2 kb mRNA species and its 100 kD (p100) primary translation product is detectable in all cell types tested. A second NFKB-2 protein, p52, corresponding to the amino-terminal half (rel domain) of NFKB-2 p100, is detectable in the same cell types and derives from the post-translational processing of p100. While p100 is constitutively localized in the cytoplasm, NF-kappa B induction by TPA treatment of Hela cells is associated with cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation of NFKB-2 p52 and its appearance within DNA-binding NF-kappa B complexes. NFKB-2 p52 differs from NFKB-1p50 in its differential affinity for kappa B sequences: by itself it binds H2/HLA-kappa B sites more efficiently than HIV/IgK-kappa B sites, while it can bind both sites efficiently when complexed with Rel-A(p65). Transient co-transfection of expression and reporter plasmids in cells devoid of endogenous NF-kappa B activity showed that p52 has no intrinsic transcriptional activation capabilities: it can stimulate Rel-A(p65)-driven transcription by formation of p65/p52 heterodimers, whereas, overexpressed, it down-regulates p65-dependent transcription by formation of inactive p52/p52 homodimers. These results indicate that the NFKB-2 gene codes for an inducible NF-kappa B transcription factor with the capability of differentially regulating NF-kappa B transcription depending on its abundance in the nucleu.
, biochemical and epidemiological evidence implicate HTLV-I as an etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL). The Tax protein of HTLV-I, a positive transcriptional activator of HTLV-I gene expression, is a viral oncogene that also increases transcription of cellular genes including GM-CSF, IL-2R alpha and IL-2. One of the cellular targets of the trans-activating effects of Tax is the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors, pleiotropic regulators of immunoregulatory, cytokine and viral gene expression. In this report, we demonstrate that NFKB2 (lyt-10) and c-Rel are overexpressed in HTLV-I infected and Tax-expressing cells and, together, account for the majority of the constitutive NF-kappa B binding activity in these cells before and after PMA stimulation. Most importantly, we show a Tax-dependent correlation between expression of NFKB2(p100) and processing to the DNA binding NFKB2(p52) form, induction of c-Rel, and trans-activation of NF-kappa B-mediated gene expression. Furthermore, the NFKB2 precursor is physically associated with c-Rel and with Tax in HTLV-I infected cells. We propose that NFKB2 synthesis and processing allows continuous nuclear expression of an otherwise cytoplasmic protein and, in conjunction with overexpression of c-Rel, NFKB2 alters the NF-kappa B signalling pathway and contributes to leukemic transformation of T cells by HTLV-.
B is a transcription factor composed of the p50 and p65 subunits. Recent works identified another human gene which encodes a molecule related to the p50 subunit, termed p50B, p49 or lyt-10. Here, we isolated the cDNA clones encoding chicken p50B/p97 (Lyt-10). The deduced amino acid sequence of the precursor protein, p97, shows conservation of the overall structure, and 86% identity in the Rel homology domain (RHD) and 56% identity in the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) to human p50B/p97. Expression of this gene is highest in the chicken splee.
B is an important transcription factor regulating expression of genes involved in immune function, inflammation, and cellular growth control. NF-kappa B activity is induced by numerous stimuli, such as phorbol esters, B- and T-cell mitogens, the cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, and serum growth factors. The standard model for the induction of NF-kappa B activity involves the release of the transcription factor from a cytoplasmic inhibitor termed I kappa B, allowing translocation of NF-kappa B to the nucleus. I kappa B contains multiple copies of the so-called ankyrin repeat, which are apparently necessary for its function. Subunits comprising NF-kappa B and related binding activities are members of the Rel multigene family. Two such subunits, p50 and p52 (also called p50B), are proteolytically processed from precursors of 105 kDa (also called p105 and NFKB1) and 100 kDa (also called p100, NFKB2, and Lyt-10), respectively. Both contain N-terminal Rel-homologous domains as well as multiple copies of C-terminal ankyrin repeats. We show here that NF-kappa B p100 is a component of the previously identified DNA-binding activity H2TF1. In addition, we show that p100 is localized in the cytoplasm in HeLa cells, where it is associated with c-Rel, p50, or p65 (RelA). In transient-transfection assays, p100 represses the ability of NF-kappa B p65 to activate a kappa B-containing reporter construct. Transfection of p100 also results in a loss of nuclear p65 DNA binding to a kappa B probe, as measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and a loss of nuclear p65 immunoreactivity, as measured by immunoblotting. This loss of nuclear p65 is paralleled by a gain of p65 DNA-binding activity and immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm. We interpret these data as demonstrating that p100 functions as an I kappa B-like molecule to sequester Rel family members in the cytoplasm. Proteolytic processing of p100 to the activator p52 is predicted to generate several new forms of Rel family heterodimers and therefore represents a form of regulation of NF-kappa B activity distinct from the classic I kappa B pathwa.
reviously reported the identification of a novel putative proto-oncogene involved in the breakpoint of a t(10;14)(q24;q32) chromosomal translocation in a case of B-cell lymphoma. This gene, called lyt-10 (NFKB2/p52), is a member of the NF-kappa B family of transcription factors and displays a high degree of homology with the NFKB1/p50. Here we describe the genomic organization of the lyt-10 gene based on the restriction analysis of genomic phage clones and the sequence determination of exon-intron boundaries. The lyt-10 gene spans a genomic region of about 8 kb on 10q24, and contains 24 exons, ranging in size between 41 and 258 base pairs. To improve the understanding of the role of lyt-10 in lymphomagenesis, we performed Southern blot analysis to detect alterations of the lyt-10 gene in a large panel of cases representative of different types of lymphoid malignancies. We found rearrangements in 5 of 228 (approximately 2%) cases analysed: two cases of B-cell lymphoma, one case of multiple myeloma and two cases of T-cell lymphoma. The use of various probes specific for different regions of the lyt-10 locus revealed that rearrangements in positive cases lead to the partial or total deletion of the carboxy-terminal region containing the ankyrin domain. Taken together, our results indicate that lyt-10 gene rearrangements represent a recurrent lesion that may be involved in the pathogenesis of both B- and T-cell malignancies, and suggest that truncation of the ankyrin domain may be a common mechanism of lesion leading to abnormal lyt-10 activation in lymphoid neoplasi.
a ubiquitous major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific transcription factor, which binds to the palindromic kappa B enhancer site upstream of MHC class I genes. Here we report that H2TF1 consists of a polypeptide with relative molecular mass 110,000, that corresponds to the predicted 100-kDa product (NF-kappa B2 p100) encoded by the candidate proto-oncogene nfkb2 (lyt-10). H2TF1 was purified by a novel affinity chromatography method and identified as the NF-kappa B2 p100 polypeptide by peptide sequencing as well as by reactivity with a specific antiserum. Purified H2TF1 binds the MHC kappa B site with high affinity (KD = 3 x 10(-11) M), in contrast with previous reports that NF-kappa B2 p100 did not bind DN.
sed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to perform precise chromosomal mapping of the genes encoding the transcription factors c-rel, NF-kappa Bp50, NF-kappa Bp65, and lyt-10. The previously published assignments of c-rel and NF-kappa Bp50 have been refined to specific bands. The map position of lyt-10, inferred from its isolation from a t(10;14)(q24;q32) translocation, has been confirmed. NF-kappa Bp65 has now been mapped to 11q13, a site of frequent involvement in aberration in multiple tumor type.
egradation of the p100 subunit to generate p52 subunit is a hallmark of the alternative NF-κB pathway, which has been implicated in cancer. Here, we uncovered a role of the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex in mediating p100-to-p52 processing and therefore positively regulating the alternative NF-κB pathway. We observed an elevation of p97 mRNA levels in lymphoma patients, which positively correlates with NFKB2 expression, a downstream target gene of the alternative NF-κB pathway. Moreover, NFKB2 mRNA levels were aberrantly down-regulated in patients with inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), a disease caused by mutation of p97. Inactivation of p97 or depletion of the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex inhibits the processing of p100 into p52, decreasing transcription of the downstream target genes. Further analyses reveal that the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex interacts with F-box and WD repeats protein SCF(βTrCP) complex to regulate the partial degradation of p100, a process involving K48- and K11-linked ubiquitination. In line with this, in LPS-induced lung damage mice model, generation of p52 is significantly decreased in p97-KD mice compared with mock mice. Finally, abrogation of p97 ATPase activity by its specific inhibitor DBeQ, efficiently decreased proliferation of lymphoma cells. Collectively, our study revealed a regulatory role of the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex in regulating p100 partial degradation, highlighting the potential of p97 as a drug target for cancers with aberrant activation of the alternative NF-κB pathwa.
rial cell wall muramyl dipeptides MDP and glucosaminyl-MDP (GMDP) are powerful immunostimulators but their binding target remains controversial. We previously reported expression cloning of GMDP-binding polypeptides and identification of Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) as their sole target. Here we show specific binding of GMDP to recombinant YB-1 protein and subcellular colocalization of YB-1 and GMDP. GMDP binding to YB-1 upregulated gene expression levels of NF-κB2, a mediator of innate immunity. Furthermore, YB-1 knockdown abolished GMDP-induced Nfkb2 expression. GMDP/YB-1 stimulation led to NF-κB2 cleavage, transport of activated NF-κB2 p52 to the nucleus, and upregulation of NF-κB2-dependent chemokine Cxcr4 gene expression. Therefore, our findings identify YB-1 as new target for muramyl peptide signalin.
containing pharmaceuticals are potent therapeutic agents that influence multiple cellular pathways. Despite proven clinical efficacy, there is a significant lack of data that directly defines the molecular mechanisms of action of related, yet distinct fumarate compounds. We systematically compared the impact of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), monomethyl fumarate (MMF) and a mixture of monoethyl fumarate salts (Ca(++), Mg(++), Zn(++); MEF) on defined cellular responses. We demonstrate that DMF inhibited NF-κB-driven cytokine production and nuclear translocation of p65 and p52 in an Nrf2-independent manner. Equivalent doses of MMF and MEF did not affect NF-κB signaling. These results highlight a key difference in the biological impact of related, yet distinct fumarate compound.
croenvironment functions as an important determinant of the inflammatory response elicited by the resident cells. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Our systems-level analyses identified a duration code that instructs stimulus specific crosstalk between TLR4-activated canonical NF-κB pathway and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR) induced non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Indeed, LTβR costimulation synergistically enhanced the late RelA/NF-κB response to TLR4 prolonging NF-κB target gene-expressions. Concomitant LTβR signal targeted TLR4-induced newly synthesized p100, encoded by Nfkb2, for processing into p52 that not only neutralized p100 mediated inhibitions, but potently generated RelA:p52/NF-κB activity in a positive feedback loop. Finally, Nfkb2 connected lymphotoxin signal within the intestinal niche in reinforcing epithelial innate inflammatory RelA/NF-κB response to Citrobacter rodentium infection, while Nfkb2(-/-) mice succumbed to gut infections owing to stromal defects. In sum, our results suggest that signal integration via the pleiotropic NF-κB system enables tissue microenvironment derived cues in calibrating physiological response.
dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), a mammalian mitochondrial serine kinase has emerged as an interesting candidate for diabetes therapy. Due to the high prevalence of this disease especially type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the health complications associated with it, there is extensive effort to find the appropriate treatment. Understanding the regulation of PDK4 activity would therefore contribute significantly to the development of therapeutic agents. This research outlines the utilization of bioinformatics tools such as Interweaver, ClustalW and Protein Structure Visualizer, in order to predict proteins that potentially interact with PDK4 and possibly regulate its activity. Interweaver database identified 96 proteins that have possible interaction sites for PDK4. Protein p100/p49, containing a death domain that is known to have a role in suppressing apoptosis, was identified as a potential partner for PDK4. The alignment between p100/p49 primary sequence and that of PDK4 using ClustalW demonstrated sequence similarity between the two proteins. Swiss PDB Viewer then located the positions of the amino acids that are in the hypothetical protein binding motif of p100/p49 within the 3D structure of hPDK4. These amino acids were found to be located in the region of PDK4 which is known to bind protein substrates of PDK4 and may be accessible to other proteins as well. These findings were very interesting as PDK4 has not previously been associated with apoptosis and this could be the link between apoptosis and insulin resistance. Cell biology studies were then performed to verify the relationship between PDK4 and apoptosis. In this regard, HeLa and HepG2 cells were treated with apoptosis-inducing agents such as TNFα, C2-ceramide, and linoleic acid. These cells were then monitored for apoptosis and PDK4 mRNA expression using a DNA laddering assay as well as Real Time PCR. The results showed that these factors induced apoptosis in a concentration dependent manner and suppressed PDK4 mRNA levels. These findings suggested a relationship between PDK4 and apoptosi.
inase NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) mediates the activation of the noncanonical NF-κB2 pathway, and it plays an important role in regulating immune cell development and liver homeostasis. NIK levels are extremely low in quiescent cells due to ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, and cytokines stimulate NIK activation through increasing NIK stability; however, regulation of NIK stability is not fully understood. Here we identified CHIP (carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein) as a new negative regulator of NIK. CHIP contains three N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a middle dimerization domain, and a C-terminal U-box. The U-box domain contains ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that promotes ubiquitination of CHIP-bound partners. We observed that CHIP bound to NIK via its TPR domain. In both HEK293 and primary hepatocytes, overexpression of CHIP markedly decreased NIK levels at least in part through increasing ubiquitination and degradation of NIK. Accordingly, CHIP suppressed NIK-induced activation of the noncanonical NF-κB2 pathway. CHIP also bound to TRAF3, and CHIP and TRAF3 acted coordinately to efficiently promote NIK degradation. The TPR but not the U-box domain was required for CHIP to promote NIK degradation. In mice, hepatocyte-specific overexpression of NIK resulted in liver inflammation and injury, leading to death, and liver-specific expression of CHIP reversed the detrimental effects of hepatic NIK. Our data suggest that CHIP/TRAF3/NIK interactions recruit NIK to E3 ligase complexes for ubiquitination and degradation, thus maintaining NIK at low levels. Defects in CHIP regulation of NIK may result in aberrant NIK activation in the liver, contributing to live injury, inflammation, and diseas.
cR (FcμR) promotes B cell survival, but the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. We show using FcμR(-/-) and wild-type mice that FcμR specifically enhanced B cell survival induced by BCR cross-linking with F(ab')2-anti-IgM Abs while having no effect on survival when the B cells were activated by CD40 ligation or LPS stimulation. FcμR expression was markedly upregulated by anti-IgM stimulation, which may promote enhanced FcμR signaling in these cells. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analyses demonstrated that FcμR colocalized with the BCR on the plasma membrane of primary B cells. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis further revealed that FcμR physically interacted with the BCR complex. Because NF-κB plays a prominent role in B cell survival, we analyzed whether FcμR was involved in BCR-triggered NF-κB activation. FcμR did not affect BCR-triggered IκBα phosphorylation characteristic of the canonical NF-κB activation pathway but promoted the production of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway component p52. Consistent with the elevated p52 levels, FcμR enhanced BCR-triggered expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-xL. Importantly, FcμR stimulation alone in the absence of BCR signaling had no effect on either IκBα phosphorylation or the expression of p52 and BCL-xL. Therefore, FcμR relied on the BCR signal to activate the noncanonical NF-κB pathway and enhance B cell survival. These results reveal a cross-talk downstream of FcμR and BCR signaling and provide mechanistic insight into FcμR-mediated enhancement of B cell survival after BCR stimulatio.
nalling is an important factor in the development of inflammation-associated cancers. Mouse models of Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer and colitis-associated colorectal cancer have demonstrated that classical NF-κB signalling is an important regulator of these processes. In the stomach, it has also been demonstrated that signalling involving specific NF-κB proteins, including NF-κB1/p50, NF-κB2/p52, and c-Rel, differentially regulate the development of gastric pre-neoplasia. To investigate the effect of NF-κB subunit loss on colitis-associated carcinogenesis, we administered azoxymethane followed by pulsed dextran sodium sulphate to C57BL/6, Nfkb1(-/-), Nfkb2(-/-), and c-Rel(-/-) mice. Animals lacking the c-Rel subunit were more susceptible to colitis-associated cancer than wild-type mice, developing 3.5 times more colonic polyps per animal than wild-type mice. Nfkb2(-/-) mice were resistant to colitis-associated cancer, developing fewer polyps per colon than wild-type mice (median 1 compared to 4). To investigate the mechanisms underlying these trends, azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate were administered separately to mice of each genotype. Nfkb2(-/-) mice developed fewer clinical signs of colitis and exhibited less severe colitis and an attenuated cytokine response compared with all other groups following DSS administration. Azoxymethane administration did not fully suppress colonic epithelial mitosis in c-Rel(-/-) mice and less colonic epithelial apoptosis was also observed in this genotype compared to wild-type counterparts. These observations demonstrate different functions of specific NF-κB subunits in this model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis. NF-κB2/p52 is necessary for the development of colitis, whilst c-Rel-mediated signalling regulates colonic epithelial cell turnover following DNA damag.
mphoma (Bcl)-3 is a nonclassical member of the IκB protein family known to interact with transcriptionally inactive NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 homodimers to modulate gene expression. Besides its action as an oncoprotein, Bcl-3 has been shown to have both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions depending on the cell-type affected. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Tassi et&nbsp;al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2015. 45: 1059-1068] report that Bcl-3 inhibits the production of the proinflammatory chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 in keratinocytes, thereby restricting the influx of CD8(+) effector T cells in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis. In addition, mice with a global deficiency of Bcl-3 show enhanced ear swelling responses in the late phase of contact hypersensitivity responses. Besides keratinocytes, other radioresistant cell types appear to also utilize Bcl-3 to dampen the inflammatory response. This Commentary will discuss the evidence supporting Bcl-3 as a critical player in limiting inflammation during the later stages of contact hypersensitivit.
an atypical member of the IκB family. Bcl-3 functions as a cofactor of p50/NF-κB1 or p52/NF-κB2 homodimers in nuclei, where it modulates NF-κB-regulated transcription in a context-dependent way. Bcl-3 has tumorigenic potential, is critical in host defense of pathogens, and has been reported to ameliorate or exacerbate inflammation, depending on disease model. However, cell-specific functions of Bcl-3 remain largely unknown. Here, we explored the role of Bcl-3 in a contact hypersensitivity (CHS) mouse model, which depends on the interplay between keratinocytes and immune cells. Bcl-3-deficient mice exhibited an exacerbated and prolonged CHS response to oxazolone. Increased inflammation correlated with higher production of chemokines CXCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10, and consequently increased recruitment of neutrophils and CD8(+) T cells. BM chimera experiments indicated that the ability of Bcl-3 to reduce the CHS response depended on Bcl-3 activity in radioresistant cells. Specific ablation of Bcl-3 in keratinocytes resulted in increased production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 and sustained recruitment of specifically CD8(+) T cells. These findings identify Bcl-3 as a critical player during the later stage of the CHS reaction to limit inflammation via actions in radioresistant cells, including keratinocyte.
drome is a rare condition combining anterior pituitary hormone deficiency with common variable immunodeficiency. NFKB2 mutations have recently been identified in patients with ACTH and variable immunodeficiency. A similar mutation was previously found in Nfkb2 in the immunodeficient Lym1 mouse strain, but the effect of the mutation on endocrine function was not evaluate.
ained six unrelated DAVID syndrome families. We performed whole exome and traditional Sanger sequencing to search for causal genes. Lym1 mice were examined for endocrine developmental anomalie.
 in the NFKB2 gene were identified in three of our families through whole exome sequencing, and in a fourth by direct Sanger sequencing. De novo origin of the mutations could be demonstrated in three of the families. All mutations lie near the C-terminus of the protein-coding region, near signals required for processing of NFΚB2 protein by the alternative pathway. Two of the probands had anatomical pituitary anomalies, and one had growth and thyroid hormone as well as ACTH deficiency; these findings have not been previously reported. Two children of one of the probands carried the mutation and have to date exhibited only an immune phenotype. No mutations were found near the C-terminus of NFKB2 in the remaining two probands; whole exome sequencing has been performed for one of these. Lym1 mice, carrying a similar Nfkb2 C-terminal mutation, showed normal pituitary anatomy and expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC.
m previous findings that mutations near the C-terminus of NFKB2 cause combined endocrine and immunodeficiencies. De novo status of the mutations was confirmed in all cases for which both parents were available. The mutations are consistent with a dominant gain-of-function effect, generating an unprocessed NFKB2 super-repressor protein. We expand the potential phenotype of such NFKB2 mutations to include additional pituitary hormone deficiencies as well as anatomical pituitary anomalies. The lack of an observable endocrine phenotype in Lym1 mice suggests that the endocrine component of DAVID syndrome is either not due to a direct role of NFKB pathways on pituitary development, or else that human and mouse pituitary development differ in its requirements for NFKB pathway functio.
activator of the noncanonical NFκB pathway, provides critical survival signals during B cell maturation and contributes to B cell proliferation. We found that the NFκB family member RelB is required ex vivo for B cell maturation, but cRel is required for proliferation. Combined molecular network modeling and experimentation revealed Nfkb2 p100 as a pathway switch; at moderate p100 synthesis rates in maturing B cells, BAFF fully utilizes p100 to generate the RelB:p52 dimer, whereas at high synthesis rates, p100 assembles into multimeric IκBsome complexes, which BAFF neutralizes in order to potentiate cRel activity and B cell expansion. Indeed, moderation of p100 expression or disruption of IκBsome assembly circumvented the BAFF requirement for full B cell expansion. Our studies emphasize the importance of p100 in determining distinct NFκB network states during B cell biology, which causes BAFF to have context-dependent functional consequence.
nisms that govern proteolytic maturation or complete destruction of the precursor proteins p100 and p105 are fundamental to homeostasis and activation of NF-κB; however, they remain poorly understood. Using mass-spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of noncanonical LTβR-induced signaling, we demonstrate that stimulation induces simultaneous processing of both p100 and p105. The precursors not only form hetero-oligomers but also interact with the ATPase VCP/p97, and their induced proteolysis strictly depends on the signal response domain (SRD) of p100, suggesting that the SRD-targeting proteolytic machinery acts in cis and in trans. Separation of cellular pools by isotope labeling revealed synchronous dynamics of p105 and p100 proteolysis. The generation of p50 and p52 from their precursors depends on functional VCP/p97. We have developed quantitative mathematical models that describe the dynamics of the system and predict that p100-p105 complexes are signal responsiv.
an atypical member of the IκB family that modulates transcription in the nucleus via association with p50 (NF-κB1) or p52 (NF-κB2) homodimers. Despite evidence attesting to the overall physiologic importance of Bcl-3, little is known about its cell-specific functions or mechanisms. Here we demonstrate a T-cell-intrinsic function of Bcl-3 in autoimmunity. Bcl-3-deficient T cells failed to induce disease in T cell transfer-induced colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The protection against disease correlated with a decrease in Th1 cells that produced the cytokines IFN-γ and GM-CSF and an increase in Th17 cells. Although differentiation into Th1 cells was not impaired in the absence of Bcl-3, differentiated Th1 cells converted to less-pathogenic Th17-like cells, in part via mechanisms involving expression of the RORγt transcription factor. Thus, Bcl-3 constrained Th1 cell plasticity and promoted pathogenicity by blocking conversion to Th17-like cells, revealing a unique type of regulation that shapes adaptive immunit.
on of I kappaB (κB) inhibitors is critical to activation of dimeric transcription factors of the NF-κB family. There are two types of IκB inhibitors: the prototypical IκBs (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε), which form low-molecular-weight (MW) IκB:NF-κB complexes that are highly stable, and the precursor IκBs (p105/IκBγ and p100/IκBδ), which form high-MW assemblies, thereby suppressing the activity of nearly half the cellular NF-κB [Savinova OV, Hoffmann A, Ghosh G (2009) Mol Cell 34(5):591-602]. The identity of these larger assemblies and their distinct roles in NF-κB inhibition are unknown. Using the X-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of p100/IκBδ and functional analysis of structure-guided mutants, we show that p100/IκBδ forms high-MW (IκBδ)4:(NF-κB)4 complexes, referred to as kappaBsomes. These IκBδ-centric &quot;kappaBsomes&quot; are distinct from the 2:2 complexes formed by IκBγ. The stability of the IκBδ tetramer is enhanced upon association with NF-κB, and hence the high-MW assembly is essential for NF-κB inhibition. Furthermore, weakening of the IκBδ tetramer impairs both its association with NF-κB subunits and stimulus-dependent processing into p52. The unique ability of p100/IκBδ to stably interact with all NF-κB subunits by forming kappaBsomes demonstrates its importance in sequestering NF-κB subunits and releasing them as dictated by specific stimuli for developmental program.
actor κB regulates various genes involved in the immune response, inflammation, cell survival, and development. NF-κB activation is controlled by proteins possessing ankyrin repeats, such as IκBs. A precursor of the NF-κB2 (p52) subunit, p100, contains ankyrin repeats in its C-terminal portion and has been found to act as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of RelA in the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. Here, we demonstrate that p100 also suppresses c-Rel function in dendritic cells. Expression of the p19 and p40 subunits of IL-23, a c-Rel-dependent cytokine, was enhanced in p100-deficient cells, although expression of a RelA-dependent cytokine, TNF-α, was reduced. Nuclear translocation of c-Rel was enhanced in p100-deficient cells. p100, and not the processed p52 form, associated with c-Rel in the steady state and dissociated immediately after lipopolysaccharide stimulation in wild-type dendritic cells. Four hours after the stimulation, p100 was newly synthesized and associated with c-Rel again. In cells expressing both c-Rel and RelA, c-Rel is preferentially suppressed by p10.
ity of dendritic cells (DC) to regulate adaptive immunity is controlled by their maturation state and lifespan. Although TNF is a well-known maturation and survival factor for DC, the role of the two TNFR, TNFR1 and TNFR2, in mediating these effects is poorly understood. By using unique TNF variants that selectively signal through TNFR1 and/or TNFR2, we demonstrate differential functions of TNFR in human monocyte-derived and blood CD1c(+) DC. Activation of TNFR1, but not TNFR2, efficiently induced DC maturation, as defined by enhanced expression of cell surface maturation markers (CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR) as well as enhanced T cell stimulatory capacity. In contrast, both TNFR1 and TNFR2 significantly protected DC against cell death, indicating that innate signals can promote DC survival in the absence of DC maturation. We further show differential activation of NF-κB signaling pathways by the TNFR: TNFR1 activated both the p65 and p52 pathways, whereas TNFR2 triggered p52, but not p65, activation. Accordingly, the p65 NF-κB pathway only played a role in the prosurvival effect of TNFR1. However, cell death protection through both TNFR was mediated through the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL pathway. Taken together, our data show that TNFR1, but not TNFR2, signaling induces DC maturation, whereas DC survival can be mediated independently through both TNFR. These data indicate differential but partly overlapping responses through TNFR1 and TNFR2 in both inflammatory and conventional DC, and they demonstrate that DC maturation and DC survival can be regulated through independent signaling pathway.
tive antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is very effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication and restoring immune functions in HIV-infected individuals. However, it fails to eradicate the latent viral reservoirs and fully resolve chronic inflammation in HIV infection. The &quot;shock-and-kill&quot; strategy was recently proposed to induce latent HIV expression in the presence of HAART. Recent studies have shown that the protein kinase C (PKC) agonists are highly potent in inducing latent HIV expression from the viral reservoirs in vitro and ex vivo and in protecting primary CD4(+) T cells from HIV infection through down-modulation of their HIV coreceptor expression. The PKC agonists are excellent candidates for advancing to clinical HIV eradication strategies. This article will present a critical review of the structure and function of known PKC agonists, their mechanisms for the reactivation of latent HIV expression, and the potential of these compounds for advancing clinical HIV eradication strategie.
 two major pathways leading to induction of NF-κB subunits. The classical (or canonical) pathway typically leads to the induction of RelA or c-Rel containing complexes, and involves the degradation of IκBα in a manner dependent on IκB kinase (IKK) β and the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO. The alternative (or non-canonical) pathway, involves the inducible processing of p100 to p52, leading to the induction of NF-κB2(p52)/RelB containing complexes, and is dependent on IKKα and NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). Here we demonstrate that in primary human fibroblasts, the alternative NF-κB pathway subunits NF-κB2 and RelB have multiple, but distinct, effects on the expression of key regulators of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and protein stability. Specifically, following siRNA knockdown, quantitative PCR, western blot analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show that NF-κB2 regulates the expression of CDK4 and CDK6, while RelB, through the regulation of genes such as PSMA5 and ANAPC1, regulates the stability of p21WAF1 and the tumour suppressor p53. These combine to regulate the activity of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, leading to induction of polycomb protein EZH2 expression. Moreover, our ChIP analysis demonstrates that EZH2 is also a direct NF-κB target gene. Microarray analysis revealed that in fibroblasts, EZH2 antagonizes a subset of p53 target genes previously associated with the senescent cell phenotype, including DEK and RacGAP1. We show that this pathway provides the major route of crosstalk between the alternative NF-κB pathway and p53, a consequence of which is to suppress cell senescence. Importantly, we find that activation of NF-κB also induces EZH2 expression in CD40L stimulated cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients. We therefore propose that this pathway provides a mechanism through which microenvironment induced NF-κB can inhibit tumor suppressor function and promote tumorigenesi.
al dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse pathologies ranging from vascular and immune diseases to cancer. TNF-α is one of the mediators of endothelial dysfunction through the activation of transcription factors, including NF-κB. While HUVEC (macrovascular cells) have been largely used in the past, here, we documented an NF-κB gene signature in TNFα-stimulated microvascular endothelial cells HMEC often used in tumor angiogenesis studie.
ed mRNA expression of 55 NF-κB related genes using quantitative RT-PCR in HUVEC and HMEC. Our study identified twenty genes markedly up-regulated in response to TNFα, including adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and apoptosis regulators, some of them being identified as TNF-α-inducible genes for the first time in endothelial cells (two apoptosis regulators, TNFAIP3 and TNFRSF10B/Trail R2 (DR5), the chemokines GM-CSF/CSF2 and MCF/CSF1, and CD40 and TNF-α itself, as well as NF-κB components (RELB, NFKB1 or 50/p105 and NFKB2 or p52/p100). For eight genes, the fold induction was much higher in HMEC, as compared to HUVEC. Most importantly, our study described for the first time a connection between NF-κB activation and the induction of most, if not all, of these genes in HMEC as evaluated by pharmacological inhibition and RelA expression knock-down by RNA interference. Moreover, since TNF-α is highly expressed in tumors, we further applied the NF-κB gene signature documented in TNFα-stimulated endothelial cells to human breast tumors. We found a significant positive correlation between TNF and the majority (85 %) of the identified endothelial TNF-induced genes in a well-defined series of 96 (48 ERα positive and 48 ERα negative) breast tumor.
ether these data suggest the potential use of this NF-κB gene signature in analyzing the role of TNF-α in the endothelial dysfunction, as well as in breast tumors independently of the presence of ER.
actor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation has been recognised as an important mechanism in the development of cancers. However, expression status of NF-kappaB-related proteins in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues is largely unknown. In this study, we analysed expressions of NF-kappaB members (p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA) and IKKepsilon in ESCC tissue.
ed the expression of p50/105, p52/p100, RelA and IKKepsilon in 58 ESCC patients' tissues by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray (TMA) metho.
sophageal squamous cells expressed p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA in 5%, 79% and 10% of the tissues in cytoplasm, respectively; however, only p52/p100 was expressed in the nuclei (12%). The cancer tissues expressed p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA in 93%, 95% and 95% in cytoplasm and/or nuclei, respectively. Nuclear immunostainings of NF-kappaB members p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA, which are considered activation of NF-kappaB signalling, were observed in 34%, 60% and 26% of the cancers, respectively. IKKepsilon is expressed in cytoplasm in 50% of the normal squamous tissues and 84% of the cancer tissues. However, none of the expression of p50/105, p52/p100, RelA or IKKepsilon was associated with pathological characteristics, including differentiation, depth of invasion and TNM stag.
ased nuclear expressions of p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA as well as increased cytoplasmic expression of IKKepsilon in the ESCC tissues compared to the normal squamous cells suggested that over-expression of these proteins may be related to activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and might play a role in the development of ESC.
ppaB signaling pathways have a critical role in the development and progression of various cancers. In this study, we demonstrated that the small cell lung cancer cell line (SCLC) H69 expressed a unique NF-kappaB profile as compared to other cancer cell lines. The p105/p50, p100/p52, c-Rel, and RelB protein and mRNA transcripts were absent in H69 cells but these cells expressed RelA/p65. The activation of H69 cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the induction of RelB and p100 expression. The treatment also induced the nuclear translocation of RelB without the processing of p100 to p52. Furthermore, LPS-induced beta1 integrin expression and cellular attachment through an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism. Blocking RelB expression prevented the increase in the expression of beta1 integrin and the attachment of H69. Taken together, the results suggest that RelB was responsible for the LPS-mediated attachment and may play an important role in the progression of some cancer.
n of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling is considered an important mechanism in the development of prostate cancers. A recent study revealed that IkappaB kinase epsilon (IKKepsilon), an activator of NF-kappaB, was overexpressed in breast cancers and acted as an oncogene. Expression of NF-kappaB members has been reported in prostate cancer tissues, but expression of IKKepsilon has not yet been studied in prostate cancers. In this study, we attempted to explore as to whether expressions of IKKepsilon and NF-kappaB members p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA are altered in prostate cancers. We analyzed the expression of IKKepsilon, p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA in 107 prostate adenocarcinoma tissues by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray (TMA) method. In the TMA, IKKepsilon is expressed in basal cells, but not in alveolar cells in normal prostate glands. IKKepsilon is expressed in 60.0% of prostate intraepithelial neoplasm (PIN) and 70.1% of the prostate cancers in the cytoplasm. Nuclear immunostainings of NF-kappaB members p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA, which are considered activation of NF-kappaB signaling, were observed respectively in 28.0%, 18.7% and 37.4% of the cancers. Nuclear staining was detected neither in normal alveolar cells nor in PIN. However, none of the expression of p50/105 nor p52/p100 nor RelA nor IKKepsilon was associated with pathologic characteristics, including size of the cancers, age, Gleason score and stage. The increased cytoplasmic expression of IKKepsilon as well as the increased nuclear expressions of p50/105, p52/p100 and RelA in the prostate cancers compared to normal alveolar cells suggested that overexpression of these proteins may be related to activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and might play a role in tumorigenesis of prostate cancer.
 Nfkb2 proteins p105 and p100 serve both as NF-kappaB precursors and inhibitors of NF-kappaB dimers. In a biochemical characterization of endogenous cytoplasmic and purified recombinant proteins, we found that p105 and p100 assemble into high-molecular-weight complexes that contribute to the regulation of all NF-kappaB isoforms. Unlike the classical inhibitors IkappaBalpha, -beta, and -epsilon, high-molecular-weight complexes of p105 and p100 proteins bind NF-kappaB subunits in two modes: through direct dimerization of Rel homology domain-containing NF-kappaB polypeptides and through interactions of the p105 and p100 ankyrin repeats with preformed NF-kappaB dimers, thereby mediating the bona fide IkappaB activities, IkappaBgamma and IkappaBdelta. Our biochemical evidence suggests an assembly pathway in which kinetic mechanisms control NF-kappaB dimer formation via processing and assembly of large complexes that contain IkappaB activitie.
ppaB family member RelB has many properties not shared by other family members such as restricted subunit association and lack of regulation by the classical IkappaB proteins. We show that the protein level of RelB is significantly reduced in the absence of p100 and reduced even more when both p100 and p105 are absent. RelB stabilizes itself by directly interacting with p100, p105, and their processed products. However, RelB forms complexes with its partners using different interaction modes. Although the C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of p105 is not involved in the RelB-p105 complex formation, all domains and flexible regions of each protein are engaged in the RelB-p100 complex. In several respects the RelB-p52 and RelB-p100 complexes are unique in the NF-kappaB family. The N-terminal domain of p100/p52 interacts with RelB but not RelA. The transcriptional activation domain of RelB, but not RelA, directly interacts with the processing region of p100. These unique protein-protein contacts explain why RelB prefers p52 as its dimeric partner for transcriptional activity and is retained in the cytoplasm as an inhibited complex by p100. This association-mediated stabilization of RelB implies a possible role for RelB in the processing of p100 into p5.
ppaB signaling pathway regulates the activity of multiple dimeric transcription factors that are generated from five distinct monomers. The availabilities of specific dimers are regulated during cell differentiation and organ development and determine the cell's responsiveness to inflammatory or developmental signals. An altered dimer distribution is a hallmark of many chronic diseases. Here, we reveal that the cellular processes that generate different NF-kappaB dimers are highly connected through multiple cross-regulatory mechanisms. First, we find that steady-state expression of RelB is regulated by the canonical pathway and constitutive RelA activity. Indeed, synthesis control of RelB is the major determinant of noncanonical NF-kappaB dimer activation. Second, processing, not synthesis, of p100 and p105 is mechanistically linked via competitive dimerization with a limited pool of RelA and RelB. This homeostatic cross-regulatory mechanism determines the availability of the p50- and p52-containing dimers and also of the noncanonical IkappaB p100. Our results inform a wiring diagram to delineate NF-kappaB dimer formation that emphasizes that inflammatory and developmental signaling cannot be considered separately but are highly interconnecte.
accharides (LPS) are potent polyclonal B-lymphocyte activators. Recently, we have shown that LPS inhibits both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis in mature B lymphocytes, through cytosolic retention of Bax, a proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, by preventing its translocation to mitochondria. Research within the last few years has revealed that members of the NF-kappaB transcription factor regulate cell viability by activating genes involved in mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. In this report, we examined the effect of sustained LPS stimulation on cytosolic and nuclear proteins of the IkappaB/NF-kappaB family to determine which NF-kappaB pathway, canonical (classical) or noncanonical (alternative), is activated by this agent in mature B cells. Immunoblotting analyses showed that LPS induced a time-dependent degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitors IkappaBbeta and IkappaBepsilon (preferentially to isoform IkappaBalpha), via IkappaB kinase beta. In addition, we observed that LPS triggered the processing of NF-kappaB p105 to p50 and that of NF-kappaB p100 to p52 in parallel with nuclear translocation of active p50 and p52, as NF-kappaBp50/RelA and NF-kappaBp52/RelB heterodimers, respectively. These results suggest that sustained stimulation with LPS can activate NF-kappaB through both classical and alternative pathway.
 of the rodent heart activates the fetal gene program, decreases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PPARalpha-regulated gene expression (MCAD), and induces cardiomyocyte atrophy. NF-kappaB regulates the fetal gene program and PPARalpha-regulated gene expression during cardiac hypertrophy and induces atrophy in skeletal muscle. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that NF-kappaB is the regulator for activation of the fetal gene program, for downregulation of PPARalpha and PPARalpha-regulated gene expression, and for cardiomyocyte atrophy in the heart subjected to mechanical unloadin.
n of the inhibitory kappa B kinase beta (IKKbeta)/NF-kappaB pathways were measured in the heterotopically transplanted rat heart using Western blotting of total and phospho-IKKbeta and using transcription factor ELISA's for the five members of the NF-kappaB family (p65 (Rel A), p105/p50, c-Rel, RelB, and p100/p52). In loss of function experiments, we transplanted hearts of p105/p50 knockout mice into wildtype mice and compared changes in gene expression and cardiomyocyte size with wildtype hearts transplanted into wildtype mic.
 phospho-IKKbeta levels significantly increased in the transplanted heart seven days after surgery. The activation of IKKbeta was paralleled by increased DNA binding activity of p65 and p105/p50. Mechanical unloading induced myosin heavy chain beta expression and decreased cardiomyocyte size in hearts of both wildtype and p105/p050 knockout animals. In contrast, the downregulation of PPARalpha and MCAD was significantly attenuated or prevented in the hearts of p105/p50 knockout mic.
ta/p65/p50 pathway is activated in the unloaded rodent heart and a likely regulator for the downregulation of PPARalpha and PPARalpha-regulated gene expressio.
two decades have led to a tremendous work on the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its molecular mechanisms of activation. The nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB is controlled by two main pathways: the classical and the alternative NF-kappaB pathways. The classical NF-kappaB pathway activates the IKK complex that controls the inducible degradation of most IkappaB family members that are IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, IkappaBvarepsilon and p105. The alternative NF-kappaB pathway induces p100 processing and p52 generation through the activation of at least two kinases, which are NIK and IKKalpha. Genetic studies have shown that IKKgamma is dispensable for the alternative pathway, which suggests the existence of an alternative IKKalpha-containing complex. It is noteworthy that activation of particular p52 heterodimers like p52/RelB requires solely the alternative pathway while activation of p52/p65 or p52/c-Rel involves a &quot;hybrid pathway&quot;. Among others, LTbetaR, BAFF-R, CD40 and RANK have the ability to induce the alternative pathway. The latter plays some roles in biological functions controlled by these receptors, which are the development of secondary lymphoid organs, the proliferation, survival and maturation of B cell, and the osteoclastogenesis. Exacerbated activation of the alternative pathway is potentially associated to a wide range of disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis or B cell lymphomas. Therefore, inhibitors of the alternative pathway could be valuable tools for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and cancer.
udies revealed that the lymphotoxin/lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT)/LTbetaR system activates the noncanonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway involving I kappa B kinase 1/I kappa B kinase alpha (IKK1/IKKalpha) and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) to direct processing of the nfkappab2 protein p100 to yield RelB:p52 complexes. Despite the biochemical evidence, LT-, RelB-, p52-deficient mice show discrepant phenotypes. We now demonstrate that p105/p50 also constitutes an important pathway for LTbetaR signaling. Our studies revealed that mice deficient in either p50 or p52 have defects in the formation of inguinal lymph nodes (LNs), but that the complete defect in lymph node formation and splenic microarchitecture seen in LT-deficient mice is recapitulated only in mice deficient in both p50 and p52. Biochemically, we find not only that both p50- and p52-containing NF-kappaB activities are induced by LTbetaR signaling, but that the induction of NF-kappaB-containing complexes by LTbetaR engagement is perturbed in single knockouts. Importantly, the LTbetaR can additionally activate the less well-characterized p52:RelA and p50:RelB pathways, which play pivotal roles in vivo for the development and organization of lymphoid structures. Our genetic, cellular, and molecular evidence points toward a model of LT-mediated NF-kappaB regulation in which p105/p50 and p100/p52 have distinct and coordinating molecular specificities but differ in the upstream signaling pathways that regulate the.
reviously shown that functional components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway are up-regulated and sequestered in the cytoplasm of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)-transformed cell lines leading to a reduced activity of NF-kappaB. In this study, we examined the expression of the NF-kappaB precursors p100 and p105 in keratinocytes transformed or not by HPV16. Western immunoblotting experiments demonstrated high levels of p100 and p105 proteins not only in HPV16+ cervical carcinoma-derived keratinocytes but also in keratinocytes stably transfected by HPV16 E6 or E7 oncogenes. Moreover, p100 and p105 proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear in keratinocytes expressing E7 and E6, respectively. A predominantly cytoplasmic localization of E7 protein was also detected in all keratinocytes expressing E7. Our results suggest that HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins modulate the expression and the subcellular localization of p100 and p105 NF-kappaB precursor.
odes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. While p52 functions as a Rel transcription factor, the larger p100 protein acts as a cytoplasmic inhibitor of select NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor complexes. Because of their distinct functions, we have studied the biochemical basis for the production of these two nfkb2-derived gene products. Like the p50 product of the nfkb1 gene, p52 is principally generated in a cotranslational manner involving proteolytic processing by the proteasome. The generation of p52 is dependent on a glycine-rich region (GRR) located upstream of the p52 C-terminus, and repositioning of this GRR alters the location of proteasome processing. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105. Using p100/p105 chimeras containing different segments of the nfkb1 and nfkb2 genes, we have found that diminished p52 processing is a property conferred by peptide sequences located downstream of the GRR, flanking the site of p52 processin.
on of highly purified primary T lymphocytes through CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules induces a long-term proliferation, dependent on persistent autocrine secretion of interleukin 2 (IL-2), high and prolonged expression of inducible CD25/IL-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2Ralpha), and secretion of growth factors such as the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). CD28 costimulation appears to activate cytokine gene expression through conserved kappaB-related CD28 response (CD28RE) or cytokine 1 (CK-1) elements in addition to canonical NF-kappaB-binding sites. In this report, we assess: 1) the evolution of the expression, over an 8-day time period, of the Rel/NF-kappaB family of proteins in costimulated versus TcR/CD3-stimulated primary T cells; 2) the impact of changes on the in vitro occupancy of GM-CSF kappaB and CK-1, as well as IL-2Ralpha kappaB sites; and 3) the differential regulation of newly synthesized p65 and c-Rel by IkappaB proteins. We show that CD2+CD28 stimulation specifically induces, at maximal T cell proliferation phase, sustained nuclear overexpression of NFKB2 p52 and c-Rel subunits which might rely on long-lasting processing of p100 precursor for p52 and increased neosynthesis of c-Rel. This up-regulation correlates with sustained occupancy of GM-CSF kappaB and CK-1 elements by both proteins. Conversely, these subunits do not appear to bind to the IL-2Ralpha kappaB site. Costimulation, but not TcR/CD3 stimulation, appears supported by sustained down-regulation of both IkappaBalpha and -beta regulators. Furthermore, contrary to p65, c-Rel appears to display little affinity for p105, p100 and IkappaBalpha regulator.
ic degradation of the C-terminal region of NF-(kappa)B precursors to their active DNA binding forms represents an important regulatory step in the activation of NF-(kappa)B. NF-(kappa)B2(p100) is found ubiquitously in the cytoplasm; however, the site and mechanism of processing to p52 have not previously been defined. We show by deletion mapping that processing of NF-(kappa)B2(p100) terminates at alanine 405 to generate p52 and is prevented by specific inhibitors of the multicatalytic proteinase complex. Although the C-terminal I(kappa)B-like domain of NF-(kappa)B2(p100) was constitutively phosphorylated, disruption of this phosphorylation by mutagenesis demonstrated that it was not required as a signal to mediate processing. Mutational analysis further showed that cleavage of NF-(kappa)B2 is not dependent on a specific sequence motif adjacent to alanine 405, the ankyrin repeats, or other C-terminal sequences but is directed by structural determinants amino terminal to the cleavage site, within the Rel homology domain and/or the glycine hinge region. The level of processing of NF-(kappa)B2(p100) was much lower than that of NF-(kappa)B1(p105) and differed from that of I(kappa)B-alpha, suggesting differential control of processing of NF-(kappa)B/I(kappa)B family member.
 gene encodes three proteins of the NF-kappa B/Rel and I kappa B families: p105, p50, and (in mouse) I kappa B-gamma. We determined the complete genomic structure of human NFKB1. NFKB1 spans 156 kb and has 24 exons with introns varying between 40,000 and 323 bp in length. Although NFKB2, which encodes p100 and p52, also has 24 exons and has a comparable exon-intron structure, it is 20 times shorter (8 kb; Fracchiola et al. (1993) Oncogene 8, 2839-2845) than NFKB1. We propose that the long size of NFKB1 is important for transient activation of NF-kappa B complexes containing p50. I kappa B-gamma corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal half of p105. DNA sequence analysis showed that the 3'-end of human intron 11 and the 5'-end of exon 12 of NFKB1 are colinear with the 5'-untranslated region of mouse I kappa B-gamma cDNA. I kappa B-gamma is thus likely to be generated by transcription starting within intron 11 and not by alternative splicing of the mouse mRNA encoding p105 and p5.
in of HTLV-1 triggers transcriptional activation through enhancers, NF-kappa B binding site, 21-bp enhancer, and serum response element. Previously, we demonstrated binding of Tax to transcription factors NF-kappa B1 p105 and p50. Here, we report that Tax enhances expression of NF-kappa B2 at the mRNA level and proteins; the effect was more apparent on the p52 expression than on its precursor p100, suggesting post-translational regulation. Consistent with these observations, HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines expressed higher levels of p52. Tax binds to the protein products p52 and p100 which inhibits NF-kappa B proteins forming cytoplasmic complexes; the binding to p100 was preferential over NF-kappa B1 p105. However, Tax did not induce efficient dissociation of the cytoplasmic complexes p100/c-Rel or p100/p65, and thus did not induce nuclear translocation of c-Rel or p65. This was in sharp contrast to the previous observation that Tax dissociated the p105/c-Rel and I kappa B-gamma/p65 complexes. These results indicate that HTLV-1 Tax interacts with NF-kappa B2 p100 and p52 and upregulate the NF-kappa B function, but their contribution to Tax-mediated transcriptional regulation differs from those of NF-kappa B.
reviously shown that after DNA-damage, the p52 NF-kB subunit can function cooperatively with the p53 tumor suppressor to both repress and induce Skp2 expression.&nbsp; However, the wider role and activation of p52 after DNA-damage has not been determined.&nbsp; Activation of NF-kB in response to DNA break inducers can be mediated by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-dependent phosphorylation of NEMO (NF-kB essential modulator), resulting in IKKβ mediated induction of the classical NF-kB pathway, leading to the induction of RelA(p65)/p50 dimers. Here, we show that DNA damage also induces p100 (NF-kB2) processing to generate active p52. We further demonstrate that p52 generation is dependent not only on IKKα but also on atypical activation by NEMO/ATM.&nbsp; Moreover, we identify a post-DNA damage, positive feedback loop of p52 activation through induction of NF-kB2 gene expression, involving both the classical and alternative NF-kB pathways. Gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated DNA damage induced p52 dimer recruitment on multiple, p53 dependent and independent, target genes associated with promoting cell cycle arrest and cell death. These results demonstrate an important role for the alternative, p52 NF-kB pathway after DNA-damage distinct from its functions as a regulator of adaptive immunit.
enic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1) constitutively activates the 'canonical' NF-kappaB pathway that involves the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha downstream of the IkappaB kinases (IKKs). In this study, we show that LMP1 also promotes the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of p100 NF-kappaB2 resulting in the generation of active p52, which translocates to the nucleus in complex with the p65 and RelB NF-kappaB subunits. LMP1-induced NF-kappaB transactivation is reduced in nf-kb2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, suggesting that p100 processing contributes to LMP1-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional effects. This pathway is likely to operate in vivo, as the expression of LMP1 in primary EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies correlates with the nuclear accumulation of p52. Interestingly, while the ability of LMP1 to activate the canonical NF-kappaB pathway is impaired in cells lacking IKKgamma/NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, p100 processing remains unaffected. As a result, nuclear translocation of p52, but not p65, occurs in the absence of IKKgamma. These data point to the existence of a novel signalling pathway that regulates NF-kappaB in LMP1-expressing cells, and may thereby play a role in both oncogenic transformation and the establishment of persistent EBV infectio.
2 gene encodes the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein p100 from which the active p52 NF-kappaB subunit is derived by proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Ligands which stimulate p100 processing to p52 have not been defined. Here, ligation of CD40 on transfected 293 cells is shown to trigger p52 production by stimulating p100 ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated proteolysis. CD40-mediated p52 accumulation is dependent on de novo protein synthesis and triggers p52 translocation into the nucleus to generate active NF-kappaB dimers. Endogenous CD40 ligation on primary murine splenic B cells also stimulates p100 processing, which results in the delayed nuclear translocation of p52-RelB dimers. In both 293 cells and primary splenic B cells, the ability of CD40 to trigger p100 processing requires functional NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). In contrast, NIK activity is not required for CD40 to stimulate the degradation of IkappaBalpha in either cell type. The regulation of p100 processing by CD40 is likely to be important for the transcriptional regulation of CD40 target genes in adaptive immune response.
 expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is regulated by a cellular transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits; five independent genes, NFKB1(p105), NFKB2(p100), RelA(p65), c-rel and relB, that encode related proteins that bind to kappa B DNA elements have been isolated. We have previously found that NFKB2(p49/p52) acts in concert with RelA(p65) to stimulate the HIV enhancer in Jurkat T-leukemia cells. Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by NFKB2. Using Scatchard analysis, we have determined the dissociation constants of homodimeric p49 and heterodimeric p49/p65 for binding to the HIV kappa B site. p49 has a approximately 18-fold-lower affinity for the HIV kappa B site (KD = 69.1 pM) than does the approximately 50-kDa protein NFKB1(p50) derived from p105 (KD = 3.9 pM). In contrast, the affinity of heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) for this site is approximately 6-fold higher (KD = 11.8 pM) than that of p49 alone. Consistent with these findings, in vitro transcription was stimulated 18-fold by the addition of preformed, heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) protein. Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3). Recombinant I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3) inhibited the DNA binding activity of p65, p49/p65, and p50/p65 but stimulated the binding of NFKB2(p49) or NFKB1(p50). Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by p49/p65 in transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells was also inhibited by coexpression of MAD-3. These data suggest that binding of the NFKB2 subunit to the HIV enhancer is facilitated by RelA(p65) and that this NFKB2(p49)/p65 heterodimeric complex mediates transcriptional activation which is subject to regulation by MAD-.
els are increased during muscle wasting and chronic muscle degeneration and regeneration processes, which are characteristic for primary muscle disorders. Pathologically increased TNF-α levels have a negative effect on muscle cell differentiation efficiency, while IGF1 can have a positive effect; therefore, we intended to elucidate the impact of TNF-α and IGF1 on gene expression during the early stages of skeletal muscle cell differentiatio.
y presents gene expression data of the murine skeletal muscle cells PMI28 during myogenic differentiation or differentiation with TNF-α or IGF1 exposure at 0 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after induction. Our study detected significant coregulation of gene sets involved in myoblast differentiation or in the response to TNF-α. Gene expression data revealed a time- and treatment-dependent regulation of signaling pathways, which are prominent in myogenic differentiation. We identified enrichment of pathways, which have not been specifically linked to myoblast differentiation such as doublecortin-like kinase pathway associations as well as enrichment of specific semaphorin isoforms. Moreover to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a specific inverse regulation of the following genes in myoblast differentiation and response to TNF-α: Aknad1, Cmbl, Sepp1, Ndst4, Tecrl, Unc13c, Spats2l, Lix1, Csdc2, Cpa1, Parm1, Serpinb2, Aspn, Fibin, Slc40a1, Nrk, and Mybpc1. We identified a gene subset (Nfkbia, Nfkb2, Mmp9, Mef2c, Gpx, and Pgam2), which is robustly regulated by TNF-α across independent myogenic differentiation studie.
he largest dataset revealing the impact of TNF-α or IGF1 treatment on gene expression kinetics of early in vitro skeletal myoblast differentiation. We identified novel mRNAs, which have not yet been associated with skeletal muscle differentiation or response to TNF-α. Results of this study may facilitate the understanding of transcriptomic networks underlying inhibited muscle differentiation in inflammatory disease.
gly, the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy agents for breast cancer has been related to changes in the genomic profile of tumors. We investigated correspondence between growth inhibitory concentrations of paclitaxel and gemcitabine (GI50) and gene copy number, mutation, and expression first in breast cancer cell lines and then in patients. Genes encoding direct targets of these drugs, metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and those previously associated with chemoresistance to paclitaxel (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;31 genes) or gemcitabine (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) were analyzed. A multi-factorial, principal component analysis (MFA) indicated expression was the strongest indicator of sensitivity for paclitaxel, and copy number and expression were informative for gemcitabine. The factors were combined using support vector machines (SVM). Expression of 15 genes (ABCC10, BCL2, BCL2L1, BIRC5, BMF, FGF2, FN1, MAP4, MAPT, NFKB2, SLCO1B3, TLR6, TMEM243, TWIST1, and CSAG2) predicted cell line sensitivity to paclitaxel with 82% accuracy. Copy number profiles of 3 genes (ABCC10, NT5C, TYMS) together with expression of 7 genes (ABCB1, ABCC10, CMPK1, DCTD, NME1, RRM1, RRM2B), predicted gemcitabine response with 85% accuracy. Expression and copy number studies of two independent sets of patients with known responses were then analyzed with these models. These included tumor blocks from 21 patients that were treated with both paclitaxel and gemcitabine, and 319 patients on paclitaxel and anthracycline therapy. A new paclitaxel SVM was derived from an 11-gene subset since data for 4 of the original genes was unavailable. The accuracy of this SVM was similar in cell lines and tumor blocks (70-71%). The gemcitabine SVM exhibited 62% prediction accuracy for the tumor blocks due to the presence of samples with poor nucleic acid integrity. Nevertheless, the paclitaxel SVM predicted sensitivity in 84% of patients with no or minimal residual diseas.
ed disease risk has been linked to short sleep duration and sleep disturbances; however, the specific molecular pathways linking sleep loss with diseases of aging are poorly defined. Key cellular events seen with aging, which are thought to contribute to disease, may be particularly sensitive to sleep loss. We tested whether one night of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) would increase leukocyte gene expression indicative of DNA damage responses (DDR), the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and senescence indicator p16(INK4a) in older adult humans, who are at increased risk for cellular senescence. Community-dwelling older adults aged 61-86years (n=29; 48% male) underwent an experimental partial sleep deprivation (PSD) protocol over 4 nights, including adaptation, an uninterrupted night of sleep, partial sleep deprivation (sleep restricted 3-7AM), and a subsequent full night of sleep. Blood samples were obtained each morning to assess peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression using Illumina HT-12 arrays. Analyses of microarray results revealed that SASP (p&lt;.05) and DDR (p=.08) gene expression were elevated from baseline to PSD nights. Gene expression changes were also observed from baseline to PSD in NFKB2, NBS1 and CHK2 (all p's&lt;.05). The senescence marker p16(INK4a) (CDKN2A) was increased 1day after PSD compared to baseline (p&lt;.01), however confirmatory RT-PCR did not replicate this finding. One night of partial sleep deprivation activates PBMC gene expression patterns consistent with biological aging in this older adult sample. PSD enhanced the SASP and increased the accumulation of damage that initiates cell cycle arrest and promotes cellular senescence. These findings causally link sleep deprivation to the molecular processes associated with biological agin.
ng enterocolitis (NEC) and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) are acute intestinal conditions which could result in mortality and severe morbidity in preterm infants. Our objective was to identify dysregulated micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in small bowel tissues of NEC and SIP, and their possible roles in disease pathophysiolog.
med differential miRNA arrays on tissues of NEC (n = 4), SIP (n = 4) and surgical-control (Surg-CTL; n = 4), and validated target miRNAs by qPCR (n = 10 each group). The association of target miRNAs with 52 dysregulated mRNAs was investigated by bioinformatics on functional and base-pair sequence algorithms, and correlation in same tissue sample.
ted the first miRNA profiles of NEC, SIP and Surg-CTL intestinal tissues in preterm infants. Of 28 validated miRNAs, 21 were significantly different between NEC or SIP and Surg-CTL. Limited overlapping in the aberrant expression of miRNAs between NEC and SIP indicated their distinct molecular mechanisms. A proposed network of dysregulated miRNA/mRNA pairs in NEC suggested interaction at bacterial receptor TLR4 (miR-31, miR-451, miR-203, miR-4793-3p), mediated via key transcription factors NFKB2 (miR-203), AP-1/FOSL1 (miR-194-3p), FOXA1 (miR-21-3p, miR-431 and miR-1290) and HIF1A (miR-31), and extended downstream to pathways of angiogenesis, arginine metabolism, cell adhesion and chemotaxis, extracellular matrix remodeling, hypoxia/oxidative stress, inflammation and muscle contraction. In contrast, upregulation of miR-451 and miR-223 in SIP suggested modulation of G-protein-mediated muscle contractio.
t response of miRNA dysregulation in NEC and SIP, and concerted involvement of specific miRNAs in the molecular networks indicated their crucial roles in mucosa integrity and disease pathophysiolog.
or partial trisomy 10q involves a duplication of 10q, or the long arm of chromosome 10. Distal 10q trisomy is a well-recognized and defined but rare genetic syndrome in which duplication of distal segments of 10q results in a pattern of malformations. Although abnormal chromosome phenotypes are commonly detected by visualization of chromosomes by traditional cytogenetic techniques, this approach is marginal in both diagnostic sensitivity and potential for biological interpretation, thus making implementation of advanced techniques and analysis methods an important consideration in a health servic.
nt study describes the case of a Taiwanese boy from healthy parents with mental, growth, and psychomotor retardations. Additional clinical features included facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, brain atrophy, camptodactyly, and-as the first reported case-bilateral renal atrophy with chronic kidney disease stage 2 and the presence of a renal cyst in one kidney. A novel 21.8 Mb copy number variation region in chromosome region 10q23.1-10q25.1 was verified by array-comparative genomic hybridization in combination with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, 200 protein-coding genes were identified in this copy number variation region and analyzed for their biological meaning using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discover.
 to the result of gene functional enrichment analysis using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery, the Wnt signaling pathway is the most pertinent to the gene content in the copy number variation region. A change in the expression levels of some Wnt signaling pathway components and of NFKB2 and PTEN genes due to a gain in their gene copy number may be associated with the patient's clinical outcomes including brain atrophy, bilateral renal atrophy with chronic kidney disease stage 2, a renal cyst in one kidney, and growth retardatio.
 known about energy levels in oncology patients and their family caregiver.
y sought to identify latent classes of participants, based on self-reported energy levels and evaluate for differences in phenotypic and genotypic characteristics between these classe.
bscale scores from the Lee Fatigue Scale were used to determine latent class membership. Morning and evening energy scores were obtained just before, during, and for four months after the completion of radiation therapy. Genetic associations were evaluated for 15 proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene.
t classes with distinct morning energy trajectories were identified. Participants who were younger, female, not married/partnered, black, and had more comorbidities, and a lower functional status were more likely to be in the low morning energy class. Two polymorphisms (IL2 rs1479923 and NFKB1 rs4648110) were associated with morning energy latent class membership. Two latent classes with distinct evening energy trajectories were identified. Participants who were younger and male and who had more comorbidities, decreased body weight, and a lower functional status were more likely to be in the moderate evening energy class. Five different polymorphisms (IL1R2 rs4141134, IL6 rs4719714, IL17A rs8193036, NFKB2 rs1056890, and TNFA rs1800683) were associated with evening energy latent class membershi.
y provides preliminary evidence that decrements in morning and evening energy are associated with different phenotypic risk factors and cytokine gene variation.
rial (mt) DNA can be classified into haplogroups representing different geographic and/or racial origins of populations. The H haplogroup is protective against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), while the J haplogroup is high risk for AMD. In the present study, we performed comparison analyses of human retinal cell cybrids, which possess identical nuclei, but mtDNA from subjects with either the H or J haplogroups, and demonstrate differences in total global methylation, and expression patterns for two genes related to acetylation and five genes related to methylation. Analyses revealed that untreated-H and -J cybrids have different expression levels for nuclear genes (CFH, EFEMP1, VEGFA and NFkB2). However, expression levels for these genes become equivalent after treatment with a methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, sequencing of the entire mtDNA suggests that differences in epigenetic status found in cybrids are likely due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the haplogroup profiles rather than rare variants or private SNPs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that mtDNA variants can mediate methylation profiles and transcription for inflammation, angiogenesis and various signaling pathways, which are important in several common disease.
action of eukaryotic host and prokaryotic pathogen cells is linked to specific changes in the cellular proteome, and consequently to infection-related gene expression patterns of the involved cells. To simultaneously assess the transcriptomes of both organisms during their interaction we developed dual 3'Seq, a tag-based sequencing protocol that allows for exact quantification of differentially expressed transcripts in interacting pro- and eukaryotic cells without prior fixation or physical disruption of the interactio.
thelial cells were infected with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium as a model system for invasion of the intestinal epithelium, and the transcriptional response of the infected host cells together with the differential expression of invading and intracellular pathogen cells was determined by dual 3'Seq coupled with the next-generation sequencing-based transcriptome profiling technique deepSuperSAGE (deep Serial Analysis of Gene Expression). Annotation to reference transcriptomes comprising the operon structure of the employed S. enterica Typhimurium strain allowed for in silico separation of the interacting cells including quantification of polycistronic RNAs. Eighty-nine percent of the known loci are found to be transcribed in prokaryotic cells prior or subsequent to infection of the host, while 75% of all protein-coding loci are represented in the polyadenylated transcriptomes of human host cell.
q was alternatively coupled to MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA ends) to assess the advantages and drawbacks of a library preparation procedure that allows for sequencing of longer fragments. Additionally, the identified expression patterns of both organisms were validated by qRT-PCR using three independent biological replicates, which confirmed that RELB along with NFKB1 and NFKB2 are involved in the initial immune response of epithelial cells after infection with S. enterica Typhimuriu.
ed that knockdown of PPP2R5C by siRNA led to proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction in K562 cells. In this study, we further characterized the gene expression profiles after PPP2R5C suppression by microarray analysis. Genes which participate in the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT pathways, were mainly altered in the K562 cells. We propose that the mechanism for proliferation inhibition and increased apoptosis of K562 cells following PPP2R5C suppression may be related to the alteration of expression profiles of BRAF, AKT2, AKT3, NFKB2 and STAT3 gene.
actor-κB (NF-κB) family plays an important role in the development of sepsis in critically ill patients. Although several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the NF-κB family genes, only a few SNPs have been studie.
f 753 patients with major blunt trauma were included in this study. Tag SNPs (tSNPs) were selected from the NF-κB family genes (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA, RELB and REL) through construction of haplotype blocks. The SNPs selected from genes within the canonical NF-κB pathway (including NFKB1, RELA and REL), which played a critical role in innate immune responses were genotyped using pyrosequencing method and analyzed in relation to the risk of development of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndrome. Moreover, the rs842647 polymorphism was analyzed in relation to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) production by peripheral blood leukocytes in response to bacterial lipoprotein stimulatio.
s (rs28362491, rs3774932, rs4648068, rs7119750, rs4803789, rs12609547, rs1560725 and rs842647) were selected from the NF-κB family genes. All of them were shown to be high-frequency SNPs in this study cohort. Four SNPs (rs28362491, rs4648068, rs7119750 and rs842647) within the canonical NF-κB pathway were genotyped, and rs842647 was associated with sepsis morbidity rate and MOD scores. An association was also observed between the rs842647 A allele and lower TNF-α productio.
polymorphism might be used as relevant risk estimate for the development of sepsis and MOD syndrome in patients with major traum.
in-Barr virus protein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has two NF-κB activating domains within its intracellular carboxy terminus (carboxy-terminal activating region 1 [CTAR1] and CTAR2). LMP1-CTAR1 is required for B-lymphocyte transformation, is capable of transforming rodent fibroblasts, and uniquely activates phosphoinositol (PI3) kinase, the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, and expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In this study, the effects of LMP1-CTAR1 on cellular gene expression were determined by high-throughput sequencing. Additionally, the binding of bcl3 was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequencing. LMP1-CTAR1 induced few changes in transcription with more genes showing decreased expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment for genes involved in cancer and cellular movement, survival, growth, and proliferation pathways. ChIP in combination with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified bcl3 binding for more than 2,000 genes in LMP1-CTAR1-expressing cells with more than 90% of the peaks at genes detected within the probable promoter region. Only a small subset of the genes with significant changes in expression had corresponding peaks in the bcl3 ChIP. However, both NFKB2 and PI3 kinase were identified in the bcl3 ChIP. Additionally, many of the predicted upstream regulators for the changes in expression were identified in the bcl3 ChIP. Analysis of the proteins in the NF-κB pathway revealed many changes identified by the high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bcl3 ChIP that would likely activate noncanonical NF-κB signaling and possibly inhibit canonical NF-κB signaling. These findings suggest that the two LMP1 signaling domains modulate their combined activity and that the bcl3 transcription factor is likely responsible for some of the unique effects of CTAR1 on cellular expressio.
in-Barr virus protein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has potent effects on cell growth. LMP1 has two regions, carboxy-terminal activating region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2, that distinctly activate NF-κB, a transcription factor complex involved in activation of important host genes. In this study, analysis of the effects on cellular gene expression revealed that CTAR1 significantly affected cellular expression in part through effects on a specific form of NF-κB. The data suggest that LMP1 can activate a distinct subset of host gene expression through its CTAR1 domain which in combination with other signaling effects induced by the CTAR2 domain likely affects cell movement, survival, and growt.
tic characterization of the genetic alterations driving ALCLs has not been performed. By integrating massive sequencing strategies, we provide a comprehensive characterization of driver genetic alterations (somatic point mutations, copy number alterations, and gene fusions) in ALK(-) ALCLs. We identified activating mutations of JAK1 and/or STAT3 genes in ∼20% of 88 [corrected] ALK(-) ALCLs and demonstrated that 38% of systemic ALK(-) ALCLs displayed double lesions. Recurrent chimeras combining a transcription factor (NFkB2 or NCOR2) with a tyrosine kinase (ROS1 or TYK2) were also discovered in WT JAK1/STAT3 ALK(-) ALCL. All these aberrations lead to the constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway, which was proved oncogenic. Consistently, JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibition impaired cell growth in vitro and in viv.
usly reported that refeeding after a 48-h fast, used as a study model of starvation and refeeding, promotes acute liver inflammatory gene expression, which is at least partly mediated by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). We also previously demonstrated that dietary carbohydrates play critical roles in this process. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of refeeding with different carbohydrate source.
 fasted for 46&nbsp;h and then refed with 1.5% (w/w) agar gel containing 19% carbohydrate (sources: α-cornstarch, glucose, sucrose, or fructose). The liver expression of inflammatory and other specific genes was then sequentially measured for the first 14&nbsp;h after refeeding initiatio.
or 46&nbsp;h up-regulated the liver expression of endogenous ligands for TLRs (HspA5, Hsp90 aa1, and Hspd1). Refeeding with agar gel containing α-cornstarch or glucose increased the liver expression of Tlr2, proinflammatory genes (Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Cxcl1, Nfkb1, Nfkb2, RelB, Sectm1α, Il1β), stress response genes (Atf3, Asns, Gadd45 a, Perk, Inhbe), detoxification genes (Hmox1, Gsta1, Abca8b), genes involved in tissue regeneration (Gdf15, Krt23, Myc, Tnfrsf12a, Mthfd2), and genes involved in tumor suppression (p53, Txnrd1, Btg2). This refeeding also moderately but significantly elevated the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase. These effects were attenuated in mice refed with agar gel containing sucrose or fructos.
lucose, rather than fructose, plays a critical role in refeeding-induced acute liver inflammatory gene expression and moderate hepatocyte destruction. Further studies are recommended regarding the role of these effects in liver inflammation and, consequently, liver dysfunctio.
y investigated the effect of a polysaccharide purified from Pholiota nameko (PNPS-1) on the NF-κB signaling pathway of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and relevant mechanisms. The results showed that PNPS-1 could decrease the expression of maturation markers CD40 and CD80 on BMDCs. PNPS-1 also could decrease the mRNA expression of Myd88, TRAF6, TIRAP, IRAKI, IKBKB, NFKB1, NFKB2 and RelA in immature BMDCs determined by RT-PCR, and decreased the IKKβ and P65 production in BMDCs determined by Western blot, and decreased the NF-кB P65 production determined by ELISA. In addition, the effects of PNPS-1 on BMDCs were significantly impaired by treating the cells with anti-TLR2 antibody prior to PNPS-1 treatment, implying direct interaction between PNPS-1 and TLR2 on cell surface. These results indicate that PNPS-1 regulates BMDCs through TLR2 and downstream NF-кB signaling.
osuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) regulate a variety of biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, tissue repair, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and host defense. Aberrant expression of TGFβ1 and IL-10 has been associated with many types of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as well as with many types of cancer and leukemia. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) have high levels of malignant CD4+ T cells expressing IL-10 and TGFβ1 that suppress the immune system and diminish the antitumor responses. The transcriptional regulation of TGFβ1 and IL-10 expression is orchestrated by several transcription factors, including NFκB. However, while the transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes by NFκB has been studied extensively, much less is known about the NFκB regulation of immunosuppressive genes. In this chapter, we describe a protocol that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze the transcriptional regulation of TGFβ1 and IL-10 by measuring recruitment of NFκB p65, p50, c-Rel, Rel-B, and p52 subunits to TGFβ1 and IL-10 promoters in human CTCL Hut-78 cell.
ation of the CD99 antigen on the surface of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) cells via EBV LMP1-mediated NF-κB suppression of Sp1 transcriptional activity is known to be associated with the appearance of pathogenic Reed-Sternberg cells. Here, we show that in addition, EBV LMP1 heterologous NF-κB activators such as CD30 and CD40 repress the CD99 promoter, which contains multiple Sp1-binding sites but no NF-κB binding sites. In addition, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) repressed the CD99 promoter while NIK kinase mutants and JNK inhibitory protein failed to do so. Of the NF-κB subunits, NF-κB2 (p52) alone or in combination with other Rel subunits consistently inhibited the CD99, while NF-κB1 (p50) showed a marginal repressive effect. Furthermore, while transfection of LMP1 repressed the CD99 promoter in wild-type or NF-κB1 deficient MEFs, the same repression was not observed in NF-κB2 (p52)-deficient MEFs, indicating that NF-κB2 (p52) is required for LMP1-mediated repression of the CD99 promoter. Consistently, basal activity of the CD99 promoter was significantly higher in IKKα(-/-) and IKKβ(-/-) MEFs, but not in IKKΓ(-/-) MEFs compared to the wild-type control MEFs. Sp1-binding sites were directly used in the repression, because a synthetic Sp1 reporter with 10 Sp1-binding sites from the CD99 promoter was repressed by LMP1 or p52 transfection. These data indicate that LMP1-mediated NF-κB2 exhibits the major inhibitory role in the transcription at the CD99 promote.
al stem cells (MSCs) are known to induce the conversion of activated T cells into regulatory T cells in vitro. The marker CD69 is a target of canonical nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling and is transiently expressed upon activation; however, stable CD69 expression defines cells with immunoregulatory properties. Given its enormous therapeutic potential, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of regulatory cells by MSCs. Peripheral blood CD3(+) T cells were activated and cultured in the presence or absence of MSCs. CD4(+) cell mRNA expression was then characterized by microarray analysis. The drug BAY11-7082 (BAY) and a siRNA against v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B (RELB) were used to explore the differential roles of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signalling, respectively. Flow cytometry and real-time PCR were used for analyses. Genes with immunoregulatory functions, CD69 and non-canonical NF-κB subunits (RELB and NFKB2) were all expressed at higher levels in lymphocytes co-cultured with MSCs. The frequency of CD69(+) cells among lymphocytes cultured alone progressively decreased after activation. In contrast, the frequency of CD69(+) cells increased significantly following activation in lymphocytes co-cultured with MSCs. Inhibition of canonical NF-κB signalling by BAY immediately following activation blocked the induction of CD69; however, inhibition of canonical NF-κB signalling on the third day further induced the expression of CD69. Furthermore, late expression of CD69 was inhibited by RELB siRNA. These results indicate that the canonical NF-κB pathway controls the early expression of CD69 after activation; however, in an immunoregulatory context, late and sustained CD69 expression is promoted by the non-canonical pathway and is inhibited by canonical NF-κB signallin.
rdial stress response to exercise is dependent on exercise intensity and thus understanding the molecular responses between various exercise intensity levels might aid in exercise prescription. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that mediates a variety of cellular processes including inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis and cell growth/development. NF-κB can be comprised of homo- and/or heterodimers formed from five distinct proteins: p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB. NF-κB is located in the cytoplasm and kept inactive by inhibitory proteins but following the exposure to a myriad of stimuli, an activated NF-κB dimer translocates to the nucleus and exerts transcriptional effects on upwards of 150 genes. To examine the activation of NF-κB in the myocardium following exercise, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 24) were exercised by treadmill running at 20&nbsp;m/min for 30&nbsp;min or 30&nbsp;m/min for 20&nbsp;min. At 0, 2, or 24&nbsp;h following exercise, animals were anesthetized, hearts excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of hearts were homogenized, protein concentrations determined and extracts assayed for NF-κB activation (DNA binding activity) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Visual examination of EMSA autoradiographs revealed an enhanced NF-κB activation in the hearts from exercised animals when compared with non-running controls. Subsequent supershift analyses using antibodies specific for NF-κB subunits showed the higher intensity exercise was associated with p65 (RelA) in the activated NF-κB complex while the NF-κB complex in hearts from animals exercised at the lower intensity was comprised primarily of p50. These data suggest exercise is capable of activating myocardial NF-κB and that a threshold for the activation of specific NF-κB subunits may exis.
 from the BCR and B cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R or BR3) differentially regulates apoptosis within early transitional (T1) and late transitional (T2; CD21(int)-T2) B cells during selection processes to generate mature B lymphocytes. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the differential sensitivity of transitional B cells to apoptosis remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that BCR signaling induced more long-term c-Rel activation in T2 and mature than in T1 B cells leading to increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes as well as prosurvival BAFF-R and its downstream substrate p100 (NF-kappaB2). Sustained c-Rel activation required de novo c-Rel gene transcription and translation via Btk-dependent mechanisms. Like T1 cells, mature B cells from Btk- and c-Rel-deficient mice also failed to activate these genes. These findings suggest that the gain of survival potential within transitional B cells is dependent on the ability to produce a long-term c-Rel response, which plays a critical role in T2 B cell survival and differentiation in vivo by inducing anti-apoptotic genes, BAFF-R and NF-kappaB2, an essential component for BAFF-R survival signaling. Thus, acquisition of resistance to apoptosis during transitional B cell maturation is achieved by integration of BCR and BAFF-R signal.
e genetic association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and known polymorphisms in core genes of the nuclear factor (NF)kappaB pathway, the major intracellular pathway in RA pathogenesi.
 and replication sample sets of Spanish patients with RA and controls were studied. A total of 181 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) uniformly spaced along the genomic sequences of 17 core genes of the NFkappaB pathway (REL, RELA, RELB, NFKB1, NFKB2, NFKBIA, NFKBIB, NFKBIE, IKBKA, IKBKB, IKBKE, IKBKAP, KBRAS1, KBRAS2, MAP3K1, MAP3K14, TAX1BP1) were studied by mass spectrometry analysis complemented with 5'-nuclease fluorescence assays in the discovery set, 458 patients with RA and 657 controls. SNPs showing nominal significant differences were further investigated in the replication set of 1189 patients with RA and 1092 control.
reproducible association was found, although 12 SNPs in IKBKB, IKBKE and REL genes showed significant association in the discovery set. Interestingly, two of the SNPs in the IKBKE gene, weakly associated in the discovery phase, showed a trend to significant association in the replication phase. Pooling both sample sets together, the association with these two SNPs was significan.
t find any major effect among the explored members of the NFkappaB pathway in RA susceptibility. However, it is possible that variation in the IKBKE gene could have a small effect that requires replication in additional studie.
 B-cell lymphomas are a very heterogeneous group of tumors, whose differential diagnosis is frequently compromised by the lack of specific cytogenetic or molecular features. Our objective was to search for genomic features that allow a better molecular identification of the different types of lymphoma studie.
ed a panel of 87 low-grade B-cell lymphoma tumor samples that were unambiguously diagnosed (clinically and cytogenetically) as: follicular, splenic marginal zone, nodal marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, mantle cell, extranodal marginal zone MALT-type lymphoma or B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. All samples were subjected to the same high-resolution genomic DNA analysis (array-based comparative genomic hybridization): a whole genome platform that contained 44000 probes distributed across the genome. Genomic imbalances were recorded, compiled and analyze.
rcent of analyzed cases showed genomic imbalances (deletions and gain/amplifications) but the frequency of these imbalances ranged from 100% in mantle cell lymphomas to 33% in MALT lymphomas. A total of 95 new genomic imbalances affecting all lymphoma subtypes, were defined. We evaluated the extension of the genomic instability, detecting distinct patterns of genomic instability within subtypes. Specific pathways, such as nuclear factor kB (gains of REL and BCL11A, and losses of COMMD3, BIRC1, IKK1 and NFKB2), Polycomb group proteins (gain of BMI1 and deletion of PCGF6), DNA repair checkpoint pathways (deletion of 16q24 involving CDT1), or miRNA with a role in B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis (MIRN15A, MIRN16-1), were targeted by this genomic instabilit.
all subtypes of lymphomas showed gains and losses of DNA, the analysis of their genomic profiles indicated that there are specific aberrations in almost every subtype as well as frequent aberrations that are common to a large number of lymphoma types. These common aberrations target genes that are important in B-cell lymphomagenesi.
ammatory Breast cancer) is a rare form of breast cancer with a particular phenotype. New molecular targets are needed to improve the treatment of this rapidly fatal disease. Given the role of NF-kappaB-related genes in cell proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis and inflammation, we postulated that they might be deregulated in IB.
ed the mRNA expression levels of 60 NF-kappaB-related genes by using real-time quantitative RT-PCR in a well-defined series of 35 IBCs, by comparison with 22 stage IIB and III non inflammatory breast cancers. Twenty-four distant metastases of breast cancer served as &quot;poor prognosis&quot; breast tumor control.
ve (58%) of the 60 NF-kappaB-related genes were significantly upregulated in IBC compared with non IBC. The upregulated genes were NF-kappaB genes (NFKB1, RELA, IKBKG, NFKBIB, NFKB2, REL, CHUK), apoptosis genes (MCL1L, TNFAIP3/A20, GADD45B, FASLG, MCL1S, IER3L, TNFRSF10B/TRAILR2), immune response genes (CD40, CD48, TNFSF11/RANKL, TNFRSF11A/RANK, CCL2/MCP-1, CD40LG, IL15, GBP1), proliferation genes (CCND2, CCND3, CSF1R, CSF1, SOD2), tumor-promoting genes (CXCL12, SELE, TNC, VCAM1, ICAM1, PLAU/UPA) or angiogenesis genes (PTGS2/COX2, CXCL1/GRO1). Only two of these 35 genes (PTGS2/COX2 and CXCL1/GRO1)were also upregulated in breast cancer metastases. We identified a five-gene molecular signature that matched patient outcomes, consisting of IL8 and VEGF plus three NF-kappaB-unrelated genes that we had previously identified as prognostic markers in the same series of IB.
ppaB pathway appears to play a major role in IBC, possibly contributing to the unusual phenotype and aggressiveness of this form of breast cancer. Some upregulated NF-kappaB-related genes might serve as novel therapeutic targets in IB.
 dimers of different subunit composition can activate distinct subsets of target genes in vivo, however, the role of DNA recognition in this specificity is not well understood. We set out to study the DNA-binding ability of RelB/p52, the least studied of all NF-kB proteins and the main transcriptionally active product of the alternative NF-kB signaling pathway. We searched for optimal binding sites for RelB/p52 by random site selection method, using full-length proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells. The subset of RelB/p52-binding sequences defines a consensus which is very similar to the classical RelA/p50 consensus. Importantly, each of these binding sites is also recognized by RelA/p50 heterodimer with comparable affinity, questioning the existence of RelB/p52-specific kappa B site.
ular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression is down-regulated in the center of cutaneous varicella lesions despite the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). To study the molecular basis of this down-regulation, the ICAM-1 induction of TNF-alpha was analyzed in varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-infected melanoma cells (MeWo), leading to the following observations: (i) VZV inhibits the stimulation of icam-1 mRNA synthesis; (ii) despite VZV-induced nuclear translocation of p65, p52, and c-Rel, p50 does not translocate in response to TNF-alpha; (iii) the nuclear p65 present in VZV-infected cells is no longer associated with p50 and is unable to bind the proximal NF-kappaB site of the icam-1 promoter, despite an increased acetylation and accessibility of the promoter in response to TNF-alpha; and (iv) VZV induces the nuclear accumulation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor p100. VZV also inhibits icam-1 stimulation of TNF-alpha by strongly reducing NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in MRC5 fibroblasts. Taken together, these data show that VZV interferes with several aspects of the immune response by inhibiting NF-kappaB binding and the expression of target genes. Targeting NF-kappaB activation, which plays a central role in innate and adaptive immune responses, leads to obvious advantages for the virus, particularly in melanocytes, which are a site of viral replication in the ski.
udies point to a role of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling in a subset of diffuse large B cell lymphomas. We have analyzed the expression of 21 genes encoding NF-kappaB family members, upstream modulators, and targets in 32 primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with nonmalignant germinal center centroblasts, expression of BCL10, REL, IAP1, and TRAF1 was significantly lower in PCNSLs, whereas that of BAX, BCLXL, BCL2, MALT1, CARD9, CARD10, CARD11, CARD14, CCND2, cFLIP, RELA, RELB, NFKB1, NFKB2, and IRF4 was higher. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data revealed two distinct subgroups of PCNSLs, which were characterized by significantly different transcriptional levels, predominantly of BCL10, but also of REL and IAP1. Thus, these quantitative RT-PCR data with expression of genes of the NF-kappaB family as well as NF-kappaB-regulated genes together with immunohistochemical detection of nuclear RELA and REL indicate activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in PCNSLs, which may contribute to their high proliferative activity and the low level of apoptosi.
ar factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway is a multi-component pathway that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes that are involved in diverse and key cellular and organismal processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, the cellular stress response, innate immunity and inflammation. Not surprisingly, mis-regulation of the NF-kappaB pathway, either by mutation or epigenetic mechanisms, is involved in many human and animal diseases, especially ones associated with chronic inflammation, immunodeficiency or cancer. This review describes human diseases in which mutations in the components of the core NF-kappaB signaling pathway have been implicated and discusses the molecular mechanisms by which these alterations in NF-kappaB signaling are likely to contribute to the disease pathology. These mutations can be germline or somatic and include gene amplification (e.g., REL), point mutations and deletions (REL, NFKB2, IKBA, CYLD, NEMO) and chromosomal translocations (BCL-3). In addition, human genetic diseases are briefly described wherein mutations affect protein modifiers or transducers of NF-kappaB signaling or disrupt NF-kappaB-binding sites in promoters/enhancer.
er is one of the most common cancers in India and south-east Asian region consisting of more than 50% of all malignant tumors. Along with many known risk factors, infection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with the development of oral cancer and is suggested to modulate host cell transcription. Reciprocally, cellular transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB and AP-1 are known to modulate the expression of viral and other genes involved in the development of cancer. In the absence of data on NF-kappaB in relation to HPV in oral cancer, we studied the DNA binding activity and expression pattern of NF-kappaB family of proteins in different stages of oral cancer and correlated with HPV infection that has been associated with better prognosis of the disease. A total of 110 fresh oral tissue biopsies were collected comprising 10 normal controls, 34 precancer and 66 oral cancer lesions prior to chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Diagnosis of HPV was done by both consensus and type-specific PCR. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, western blots and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to assess the binding activity and expression pattern of NF-kappaB family of proteins (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, RelB and Bcl-3) in oral tissue biopsies. Twenty seven percent (18/66) of the oral cancer biopsies showed the presence of HPV infection exclusively of high risk HPV type 16, which was primarily associated with the well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (WDSCC). We observed a high constitutive activation of NF-kappaB with concomitant upregulated expression of all the NF-kappaB members in oral cancer tissues. Expression of NF-kappaB components gradually increased as the severity of lesion increased from precancer to invasive cancer. NF-kappaB p50 was found to be the major DNA binding component, which is indicative of homodimerization of p50 subunits. Interestingly, in HPV16 infected oral cancers although p50 showed high binding activity, p65 also showed a partial involvement as evidenced in supershift assay. Both by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, a differential overexpression and nuclear localization of p50, p65 and partially of Bcl-3 were observed in HPV16 positive oral cancer patients that also showed an over-expression of p21. We therefore, demonstrate a constitutive activation and differential expression of NF-kappaB proteins, which change as a function of severity of oral lesions during development of oral cancer. The NF-kappaB DNA binding is primarily due to homodimerization of p50 but infection of high risk HPV promotes participation of p65 in NF-kappaB complex formation, leading to heterodimerization of p50/p65. We propose that the involvement of p65 in HPV infected oral cancer may be linked to improved differentiation and better prognosis of the disease when treate.
of the Paramyxoviridae family of RNA viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is a leading cause of epidemic respiratory tract infection in children. In children, RSV primarily replicates in the airway mucosa, a process that alters epithelial cell chemokine expression, thereby inducing airway inflammation. We investigated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14/NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the activation of NF-kappaB-dependent genes in alveolus-like A549 cells. RSV infection induces a time dependent increase of NIK mRNA and protein expression that peaks 12 to 24 h after viral exposure. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays indicate that NIK kinase activity is activated even more rapidly (within 6 h of RSV adsorption) associated with an endogenous approximately 50-kDa NF-kappaB2 substrate. Because NIK associates with IKKalpha to mediate processing of the 100-kDa NF-kappaB2 precursor into its 52-kDa DNA binding isoform (&quot;p52&quot;), the effects of RSV on NIK complex formation with IKKalpha and NF-kappaB2 were determined by coimmunoprecipitation assay. We find that NIK, IKKalpha, and both 100 kDa- and 52-kDa NF-kappaB2 isoforms strongly complex 15 h after exposure to RSV at times subsequent to NIK kinase activation. Western immunoblot and microaffinity DNA pull-down assays showed a parallel increase in nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the NF-kappaB2-Rel B complex. Interestingly, we make the novel observations that NIK also transiently translocates into the nucleus complexed with 52-kDa NF-kappaB2. Small interfering RNA-mediated NIK &quot;knock-down&quot; blocked RSV-inducible 52-kDa NF-kappaB2 processing and interfered with the early activation of a subset of NF-kappaB-dependent genes, indicating the importance of this activation pathway in the genomic NF-kappaB response to RSV. Together, these data indicate that RSV infection rapidly activates the noncanonical NF-kappaB activation pathway prior to the more potent canonical pathway activation. This appears to be through a novel mechanism involving induction of NIK kinase activity, expression, and nuclear translocation of a ternary complex with IKKalpha and processed NF-kappaB.
ppaB family of transcription factors is critical in controlling the expression of a wide range of immune response genes. However, whether individual family members perform specific roles in regulating immunity and inflammation remains unclear. Here we investigated the requirement for NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and c-Rel in the expression of Th2 cytokine responses, development of host protective immunity, and regulation of intestinal inflammation following infection with the gut-dwelling helminth parasite Trichuris muris. While mice deficient in c-Rel mounted sufficient Th2 responses to expel infection, NF-kappaB1 knockout (KO) and NF-kappaB2 KO mice developed chronic infections associated with elevated production of Ag-specific IFN-gamma. However, only infected NF-kappaB1 KO mice exhibited polarized IFN-gamma responses associated with the loss of intestinal goblet cells and the development of destructive colitis-like pathology. Furthermore, blockade of IL-12 (previously shown to confer resistance in susceptible strains) recovered Ag-specific IL-13 responses and resistance to infection in NF-kappaB2 KO, but not NF-kappaB1 KO mice. Therefore, unique infection, immunological, and pathological outcomes were observed in different NF-kappaB KO strains. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence of nonoverlapping functions for NF-kappaB family members in the development of Th2 cytokine-mediated resistance to T. muris and the control of infection-induced intestinal inflammatio.
actor (NF) kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Bcl-3 encode for proteins of the NF-kappaB/Rel/IkappaB families, known as regulators of innate and adoptive immune responses. Targeted disruption of these genes showed essential roles in lymphoid organ development and organizatio.
1-, NF-kappaB2-, and Bcl-3-deficient mouse lines were established, and their role in organogenesis of Peyer's patches (PP) was investigate.
ic inspection showed a reduced number and size of PP in Bcl-3(-/-) and NF-kappaB1(-/-) mice but failed to detect PP in NF-kappaB2(-/-) mice. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed the presence of interleukin-7 receptor-alpha spots in NF-kappaB2(-/-) mice, indicating no defect in PP organogenesis of NF-kappaB2(-/-) mice in principle. Immunostaining shows that residual lymphocytes mainly consist of T cells. B cells are substantially reduced and are accumulated as terminal extravasations. Organized follicular structures and follicular dendritic cell networks fail to form, and myeloid, but not lymphoid, dendritic cells are obviously reduced. Expression of the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha, B-lymphocyte chemoattractant, and thymus-expressed chemokine is impaired in epithelial cells and in the subendothelial dome area that is not well defined. A similar but less severe phenotype is seen in Bcl-3(-/-) mice, which also do not develop germinal centers. In contrast, in NF-kappaB1(-/-) mice, T-cell numbers are visibly reduced, and no alteration could be observed in the B-cell and dendritic-cell population.
a show that all 3 genes are crucial for PP development but contribute differently to PP organogenesi.
/rel transcription factors are crucial regulators of development, differentiation and apoptosis of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. There is increasing evidence for an involvement of NF-kappaB/rel proteins in lymphomagenesis and resistance of lymphoid tumors to the induction of apoptosis. Structural alterations of the NF-kappaB/rel genes NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 have been shown to result in increased NF-kappaB/rel activity. Because we observed strong constitutive NF-kappaB/rel binding activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type (B-CLL) which may contribute to resistance against cytotoxic drugs we studied the genomic organisation of NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 gene loci in a panel of lymphoproliferative disorders (n=81) with an emphasis on B-CLL (n=47). The method of genomic Southern blotting using cDNAs of the respective genes was used. In spite of the role of NF-kappaB/rel in myeloid maturation there is no data available as to the occurrence of NF-kappaB/rel rearrangements in chronic myeloproliferative syndromes (cMPS). For this reason we included a small panel of cMPS patients (n=16). Southern Blotting revealed a germline configuration of NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 loci in all NHL and cMPS patients examined. Our results demonstrate that structural alterations of NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 genes at the Southern Blotting level are rare events that do not contribute to lymphoid or myeloid transformation in the majority of NHL or cMPS patient.
tand the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus L-92 cells suggested from our previous study of in vivo anti-allergy and anti-virus effects, host immune responses in macrophage-like THP-1 cells after 4 h (the early phase) and 24 h (the late phase) of cocultivation with L-92 cells were investigated by transcriptome analysis. In the early phase of L-92 treatment, various transcription regulator genes, such as, NFkB1, NFkB2, JUN, HIVEP2 and RELB, and genes encoding chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL4, CXCL11, CCL3 and TNF, were upregulated. Two transmembrane receptor genes, TLR7 and ICAM1, were also upregulated in the early phase of treatment. In contrast, many transmembrane receptor genes, such as IL7R, CD80, CRLF2, CD86, CD5, HLA-DQA1, IL2RA, IL15RA and CSF2RA, and some cytokine genes, including IL6, IL23A and CCL22, were significantly upregulated in the late phase after L-92 exposure. Some genes encoding cytokines, such as IL1A, IL1B and IL8, and the enzyme IDO1 were upregulated at both the early and the late phases of treatment. These results suggest that probiotic L-92 might promote Th1 and regulatory T-cell responses by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, followed by the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in THP-1 cell.
endent signaling pathways are critical for normal bone remodeling; however, it is unclear if dysfunctional NOTCH activation contributes to inflammation-mediated bone loss, as observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. We performed RNA sequencing and pathway analyses in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from transgenic TNF-expressing mice, a model of RA, to identify pathways responsible for decreased osteoblast differentiation. 53 pathways were dysregulated in MSCs from RA mice, among which expression of genes encoding NOTCH pathway members and members of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway were markedly elevated. Administration of NOTCH inhibitors to RA mice prevented bone loss and osteoblast inhibition, and CFU-fibroblasts from RA mice treated with NOTCH inhibitors formed more new bone in recipient mice with tibial defects. Overexpression of the noncanonical NF-κB subunit p52 and RELB in a murine pluripotent stem cell line increased NOTCH intracellular domain-dependent (NICD-dependent) activation of an RBPjκ reporter and levels of the transcription factor HES1. TNF promoted p52/RELB binding to NICD, which enhanced binding at the RBPjκ site within the Hes1 promoter. Furthermore, MSC-enriched cells from RA patients exhibited elevated levels of HES1, p52, and RELB. Together, these data indicate that persistent NOTCH activation in MSCs contributes to decreased osteoblast differentiation associated with RA and suggest that NOTCH inhibitors could prevent inflammation-mediated bone los.
 regulate prostate physiology, and exert their effects through the androgen receptor. We hypothesized that androgen deprivation needs additional transcription factors to orchestrate the changes taking place in the gland after castration and for the adaptation of the epithelial cells to the androgen-deprived environment, ultimately contributing to the origin of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study was undertaken to identify transcription factors that regulate gene expression after androgen deprivation by castration (Cas). For the sake of comparison, we extended the analysis to the effects of administration of a high dose of 17β-estradiol (E2) and a combination of both (Cas+E2). We approached this by (i) identifying gene expression profiles and enrichment terms, and by searching for transcription factors in the derived regulatory pathways; and (ii) by determining the density of putative transcription factor binding sites in the proximal promoter of the 10 most up- or down-regulated genes in each experimental group in comparison to the controls Gapdh and Tbp7. Filtering and validation confirmed the expression and localized EVI1 (Mecom), NFY, ELK1, GATA2, MYBL1, MYBL2, and NFkB family members (NFkB1, NFkB2, REL, RELA and RELB) in the epithelial and/or stromal cells. These transcription factors represent major regulators of epithelial cell survival and immaturity as well as an adaptation of the gland as an immune barrier in the absence of functional stimulation by androgens. Elk1 was expressed in smooth muscle cells and was up-regulated after day 4. Evi1 and Nfy genes are expressed in both epithelium and stroma, but were apparently not affected by androgen deprivatio.
in is a carotenoid present in the chloroplasts of brown seaweeds. When ingested, it is metabolized mainly to fucoxanthinol in the gastrointestinal tract by digestive enzymes. These compounds have been shown to have many beneficial health effects. The present study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of action of fucoxanthin and/or of its metabolite fucoxanthinol against viability of estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 and estrogen-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol reduced the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners as a result of increased apoptosis. Furthermore, fucoxanthinol-induced apoptosis was more potent than that of fucoxanthin and correlated, for MDA-MB-231 cells, with inhibitory actions on members of the NF-κB pathway p65, p50, RelB, and p52. Being overexpressed and regulated by NF-κB in different types of cancers, the transcription factor SOX9 was also decreased at the nuclear level by fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol in MDA-MB-231. Taken together, the current results suggest that fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin could be potentially effective for the treatment and/or prevention of different types of cancers, including breast cance.
igate the function of alternative NF-κB activity in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL.
expression of individual NF-κB subunits in CD5⁺CD19⁺ cells (CLL B-cells) from bone marrow (BM) of 56 patients with B-CLL was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. An ELISA-based NF-κB family transcription factor activity assay was performed to quantify the κB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from CLL B-cells. Cell death of CLL-B cells was determined by PI staining, RelA and RelB expression at protein level of CLL B-cells by Western blot analyse.
ssion levels of RelA, p50, RelB and p52 mRNA in CLL B-cells were all higher than that of normal B cells with statistical significance (P&lt;0.05). RelA was activated in almost all the patients detected while RelB activity was induced in part of samples. The average RelA activity in CLL B-cells was increased compared to that in normal B cells while the average RelB activity was similar to that of normal B cells. When cultured in vitro for 24, 48 and 72 hours, the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells from RelA⁺/RelB⁻ group were(35.54±4.43)%,(50.92±8.44)%, and(49.24±8.16)%, respectively; that of the RelA⁺/RelB⁺ group were (20.65±2.37)%, (18.17±1.36)%, and (26.55±4.08)%, respectively. When the cells from RelA+/RelB⁻ group were co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs), the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells were decreased compared to that of the cells cultured alone, while the frequencies of cell death of RelA⁺/RelB⁻ CLL B-cells were higher than that of CLL B-cells from RelA⁺/RelB⁺ group when co-cultured with hBMSCs. RelA and RelB expression in CLL-B cells from the RelA⁺/RelB⁻ group was induced after co-cultured with hBMSCs for 48 h. RelB was reduced in the cytoplasm and increased in the nucleus in CLL-B cells from the RelA+/RelB+ grou.
native NF-κB was indeed activated and presented heterogeneous in CLL B-cells from BM. Activation of RelB combined with RelA activity could provide the survival advantage to CLL B-cells from BM. Co-culture with hBMSCs could protect CLL-B cells through the induction of RelA and Rel B expression.
native nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, mainly the RelB-p52 heterodimer, plays important roles in bone metabolism through an unknown mechanism. We have previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which lack active NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), show mild osteopetrosis due to the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. p100 retains RelB in the cytoplasm and inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in aly/aly cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of RelB in aly/aly cells rescues RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by inducing p100 processing. In contrast, the overexpression of p65 in aly/aly cells has no effect. However, the overexpression of RelB fails to rescue RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in the presence of p100ΔGRR, which cannot be processed to p52, suggesting that p100 processing is a key step in RelB-rescued, RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in aly/aly cells. In this study, Cot (cancer Osaka thyroid), an MAP3K, was up-regulated by RelB overexpression. Analysis of the Cot promoter demonstrated that p65 and RelB bound to the distal NF-κB-binding site and that RelB but not p65 bound to the proximal NF-κB-binding site in the Cot promoter. The knocking down of Cot expression significantly reduced the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis induced by RelB overexpression. The phosphorylation of IKKα at threonine 23 and its kinase activity were indispensable for the processing of p100 and osteoclastogenesis by RelB-induced Cot. Finally, constitutively activated Akt enhanced osteoclastogenesis by RelB-induced Cot, and a dominant-negative form of Akt significantly inhibited it. Taken together, these results indicate that the overexpression of RelB restores RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by activation of Akt/Cot/IKKα-induced p100 processin.
 of the splenic marginal zone (MZ) depends on the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway. Recently, we reported that unrestricted activation of this pathway in NF-κB2/p100-deficient (p100(-/-) ) knock-in mice alters the phenotype of MZ stroma and B cells. Here, we show that lack of the p100 inhibitor resulted in an expansion of both MZ B and peritoneal B-1 cells. However, these cells failed to generate proliferating blasts in response to T-cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) Ags, correlating with dampened IgM and absent IgG3 responses. This phenotype was in part due to increased activity of the NF-κB subunit RelB. Moreover, p100(-/-) →B6 BM chimeras were more susceptible to infection by encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, pathogens that induce TI-2 responses. In contrast to the TI-2 defect, p100 deficiency did not impair immune responses to the TI-1 Ag LPS and p100(-/-) MZ B cells showed normal Ag transportation into B-cell follicles. Furthermore, p100(-/-) MZ B and B-1 cells failed to respond to TI-2 Ags in the presence of WT accessory cells. Thus, NF-κB2/p100 deficiency caused a predominant B-cell-intrinsic TI-2 defect that could largely be attributed to impaired proliferation of plasmablasts. Importantly, p100 was also necessary for efficient defense against clinically relevant TI-2 pathogen.
n postmenopausal women have shown that estrogen reduces circulating sclerostin levels, but effects of estrogen on skeletal sclerostin mRNA levels are unknow.
tive of the study was to evaluate the effects of short-term estrogen treatment on bone mRNA levels of sclerostin and other genes relevant to bone metabolis.
ne biopsies were obtained from 20 postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estrogen for 3 weeks and 20 untreated controls. Quantitative PCR analyses were used to examine the expression of sclerostin and other genes related to bone metabolism, including 71 additional genes linked to bone density/fracture from genome-wide association studie.
treatment was associated with lower bone sclerostin mRNA levels (by 48%, P&lt;.05) and with lower (by 54%, P&lt;.01) mRNA levels of the sclerostin-related protein, sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1), which is also a Wnt/bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor. Consistent with studies in mice showing that ovariectomy increased nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation, we found that estrogen treatment was associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory genes as a group (P=.028), with bone mRNA levels of NFKB2 and RELB (both encoding proteins in the NF-κB transcription factor complex) being significantly reduced individual genes. Eight of the 71 genome-wide association study-related genes examined were modulated by estrogen (P&lt;.05, false discovery rate&lt;0.10.
, estrogen-induced decreases in two key inhibitors of Wnt/bone morphogenetic protein signaling, sclerostin and SOSTDC1, along with reductions in NF-κB signaling, may be responsible for at least part of the protective effects of estrogen on bon.
tion factors of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) family arise through the combinatorial association of five distinct Rel subunits into functional dimers. However, not every dimer combination is observed in cells. The RelB subunit, for example, does not appear as a homodimer and forms heterodimers exclusively in combination with p50 or p52 subunits. We previously reported that the RelB homodimer could be forced to assemble through domain swapping in vitro. In order to understand the mechanism of selective dimerization among Rel subunits, we have determined the x-ray crystal structures of five RelB dimers. We find that RelB forms canonical side-by-side heterodimers with p50 and p52. We observe that, although mutation of four surface hydrophobic residues that are unique to RelB does not affect its propensity to form homodimers via domain swapping, alteration of two interfacial residues converts RelB to a side-by-side homodimer. Surprisingly, these mutant RelB homodimers remain distinct from canonical side-by-side NF-κB dimers in that the two monomers move away from one another along the 2-fold axis to avoid non-complementary interactions at the interface. The presence of distinct residues buried within the hydrophobic core of the RelB dimerization domain appears to influence the conformations of the surface residues that mediate the dimer interface. This conclusion is consistent with prior observations that alterations of domain core residues change dimerization propensity in the NF-κB family transcription factors. We suggest that RelB has evolved into a specialized NF-κB subunit with unique amino acids optimized for selective formation of heterodimers with p50 and p5.
 levels of NF-κB are hallmarks of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and both classical and alternative NF-κB activation pathways have been implicate.
how that activation of the alternative pathway is a source for the high basal NF-κB activity in PDAC cell lines. Increased activity of the p52/RelB NF-κB complex is mediated through stabilization and activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). We identify proteasomal downregulation of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) as a mechanism by which levels of active NIK are increased in PDAC cell lines. Such upregulation of NIK expression and activity levels relays to increased proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, but not migration or survival of PDAC cell.
wth is one characteristic of pancreatic cancer. Our data indicates that the TRAF2/NIK/NF-κB2 pathway regulates PDAC cell tumorigenicity and could be a valuable target for therapy of this cance.
t study demonstrated that constitutively activated RelB/NF-κB2 positively regulates the CRH in the human placenta. In the current study, we explored the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. A glucocorticoid response element (GRE) motif search suggests that both NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) and RelB genes, which are key regulators of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, have a putative GRE within their promoter, approximately 1 kb upstream from the transcription start site. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we identified that the GR and phosphorylated GR at Ser211 were associated with the GREs of both NIK and RelB. Dexamethasone stimulated expression of NIK, RelB, NF-κB2 as well as CRH and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Repression of GR by short interfering RNA resulted in inhibition of NIK, RelB, NF-κB2, CRH, and COX-2. In addition, depletion of GR attenuated glucocorticoid-mediated up-regulation of NIK, RelB, NF-κB2, CRH, and COX-2. Furthermore, siRNA specifically targeting NIK down-regulated CRH and COX-2. Taken together, these results suggest that constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in term human placenta is driven by the GR signaling, which in turn up-regulates placental CRH and other NF-κB-responsive gene.
 a key physiological mechanism for restraining self-reactive B cells. A marked portion of peripheral B cells are anergic B cells that largely depend on BAFF for survival. BAFF activates the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, both of which are required for B cell survival. In this study we report that deficiency of the adaptor protein B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) impaired the ability of BAFF to support B cell survival in vitro, and it specifically increased apoptosis in anergic B cells in vivo, dramatically reducing anergic B cells in mice. Bcl10-dependent survival of self-reactive anergic B cells was confirmed in the Ig hen egg lysozyme/soluble hen egg lysozyme double-transgenic mouse model of B cell anergy. Furthermore, we found that BAFF stimulation induced Bcl10 association with IκB kinase β, a key component of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Consistently, Bcl10-deficient B cells were impaired in BAFF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and formation of nuclear p50/c-Rel complexes. Bcl10-deficient B cells also displayed reduced expression of NF-κB2/p100, severely reducing BAFF-induced nuclear accumulation of noncanonical p52/RelB complexes. Consequently, Bcl10-deficient B cells failed to express Bcl-x(L), a BAFF-induced NF-κB target gene. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bcl10 controls BAFF-induced canonical NF-κB activation directly and noncanonical NF-κB activation indirectly. The BAFF-R/Bcl10/NF-κB signaling axis plays a critical role in peripheral B cell tolerance by regulating the survival of self-reactive anergic B cell.
e development during embryogenesis involves lymphotoxin-β receptor engagement and subsequent differentiation of a poorly defined population of mesenchymal cells into lymphoid tissue organizer cells. Here, we showed that embryonic mesenchymal cells with characteristics of adipocyte precursors present in the microenvironment of lymph nodes gave rise to lymph node organizer cells. Signaling through the lymphotoxin-β receptor controlled the fate of adipocyte precursor cells by blocking adipogenesis and instead promoting lymphoid tissue stromal cell differentiation. This effect involved activation of the NF-κB2-RelB signaling pathway and inhibition of the expression of the key adipogenic factors Pparγ and Cebpα. In vivo organogenesis assays show that embryonic and adult adipocyte precursor cells can migrate into newborn lymph nodes and differentiate into a variety of lymph node stromal cells. Thus, we propose that adipose tissues act as a source of lymphoid stroma for lymph nodes and other lymphoid structures associated with fa.
f the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family have been shown recently to be required for cellular transformation by oncogenic Ras and by other oncoproteins and to suppress transformation-associated apoptosis. Furthermore, NF-kappa B has been shown to be activated by several oncoproteins including HER2/Neu, a receptor tyrosine kinase often expressed in human breast cancer. Human breast cancer cell lines, human breast tumors and normal adjacent tissue were analysed by gel mobility shift assay, immunoblotting of nuclear extracts and immunohistochemistry for activation of NF-kappa B. Furthermore, RNA levels for NF-kappa B-activated genes were analysed in order to determine if NF-kappa B is functionally active in human breast cancer. Our data indicate that the p65/RelA subunit of NF-kappa B is activated (i.e., nuclear) in breast cancer cell lines. However, breast tumors exhibit an absence or low level of nuclear p65/RelA but show activated c-Rel, p50 and p52 as compared to nontumorigenic adjacent tissue. Additionally, the I kappa B homolog Bcl-3, which functions to stimulate transcription with p50 or p52, was also activated in breast tumors. There was no apparent correlation between estrogen receptor status and levels of nuclear NF-kappa B complexes. Transcripts of NF-kappa B-regulated genes were found elevated in breast tumors, as compared to adjacent normal tissue, indicating functional NF-kappa B activity. These data suggest a potential role for a subset of NF-kappa B and I kappa B family proteins, particularly NF-kappa B/p52 and Bcl-3, in human breast cancer. Additionally, the activation of functional NF-kappa B in these tumors likely involves a signal transduction pathway distinct from that utilized by cytokine.
tocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes encode highly polymorphic antigens that play an essential role in a number of immunological processes. Their expression is activated in response to a variety of signals and is mediated through several promoter elements among which the enhancer A is one of the key control regions. It contains binding sites for several transcription factors, for example: (i) a well-characterized binding site for rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors in its 3'-end (the H2TF1 or kappaB1 element), (ii) a second kappaB site (the kappaB2 element), which is located immediately adjacent 5' to the H2TF1 element and which is recognized by p65/relA in the human HLA system, and (iii) an AP-1/ATF recognition sequence in the 5' end (EnA-TRE). Here we demonstrate that latter element is bound by at least two distinct heterodimers of the AP-1/ATF transcription factor family, namely c-Jun/ATF-2 and c-Jun/Fra2. Moreover, our data reveal that the enhancer A is simultaneously bound by AP-1/ATF and rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors and that the cellular coactivator p300, which enhances enhancer A-driven reporter gene expression if cotransfected, is recruited to the enhancer A through this multiprotein complex. In contrast to the complete enhancer A, neither the EnA-TRE nor the H2TF1 element on their own are able to confer activation on a heterologous promoter in response to the phorbol ester tumor promoter TPA or the cytokine TNFalpha. Moreover, deletion of any one of the enhancer A control elements results in a dramatic loss of its inducibility by TNFalpha, and point mutations in either the EnA-TRE or the H2TF1 element lead to the loss of AP-1/ATF or NF-kappaB binding, respectively, and to the loss of enhancer A inducibility. Therefore, we conclude that the enhancer A is synergistically activated through a multiprotein complex containing AP-1/ATF, NF-kappaB transcription factors as well as the cellular coactivator p30.
2 (p100/p52), a member of the NF-kappaB/Rel family of transcription factors, is involved in the regulation of a variety of genes important for immune function. Previously, we have shown that the NF-kappaB2 gene is regulated in a positive and a negative manner. Two kappaB elements within the NF-kappaB2 promoter mediate tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible transactivation. In addition, we have shown that there exists a transcriptional repression in the absence of NF-kappaB. To identify a DNA binding activity responsible for this transcriptional repression, we have partially purified a nuclear complex, named Rep-kappaB. Here we further analyze this putative repressive binding activity. Detailed examination of Rep-kappaB-DNA interaction revealed the sequence requirements for binding to be almost identical to those of recombination signal binding protein Jkappa (RBP-Jkappa), the mammalian homolog of the protein encoded by Drosophila suppressor of hairless [Su(H)]. In addition, in electromobility shift assays, Rep-kappaB binding activity is recognized by an antibody directed against RBP-Jkappa. By performing transient-transfection assays, we show that human RBP-Jkappa represses basal as well as RelA (p65)-stimulated NF-kappaB2 promoter activity. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that Su(H) is implicated in the Notch signaling pathway regulating cell fate decisions. In transient-transfection assays we show that truncated Notch-1 strongly induces NF-kappaB2 promoter activity. In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that Rep-kappaB is closely related or identical to RBP-Jkappa. RBP-Jkappa is a strong transcriptional repressor of NF-kappaB2. Moreover, this repression can be overcome by activated Notch-1, suggesting that NF-kappaB2 is a novel putative Notch target gen.
cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is expressed in both endothelial and epithelial cell types, where it contributes to lymphocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Its expression is regulated by cytokines, in part through two kappa B-like regulatory elements. Because NF-kappa B can be composed of multiple alternative subunits with differential effects on gene expression, the role of different specific NF-kappa B family members subunits in VCAM-1 regulation is unknown. In this report, we define the contribution of different NF-kappa B family members to VCAM-1 gene regulation. We show that both kappa B sites in the VCAM-1 enhancer are required to optimally stimulate gene expression, but the enhancer is differentially regulated by specific combinations of NF-kappa B subunits. At low concentrations, RelA(p65) acted in concert with the approximately 50-kDa product of p105 NF-kappa B, NF-kappa B1(p50), to stimulate transcription, and at high concentrations, RelA(p65) alone stimulated the VCAM-1 promoter. In contrast, NF-kappa B2 inhibited functional activation of the VCAM reporter by p65. Consistent with this finding, an additional binding complex was detected by using recombinant NF-kappa B2(p49)/RelA(p65) with radiolabeled VCAM kappa B site probes. Interestingly, the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer responded differently to stimulation by NF-kappa B subunits, with optimal response to p49(100)/p65. Analysis of NF-kappa B mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells revealed that nfkb1, nfkb2, and relA NF-kappa B but not c-rel were induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide, which also induce VCAM-1. These data suggest that specific subunits of NF-kappa B regulate VCAM-1 and differentially activate other genes in these cell.
ionship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the induction of NF-kappa B binding activity was examined in a myeloid cell model of HIV-1 infection derived from the PLB-985 cell line. Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression, increased c-fms gene transcription, and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway. PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NF-kappa B-like binding activity that was distinct from that induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the parental PLB-985 cell line. This unique DNA binding activity consisted of proteins of 70, 90, and 100 kDa with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF-kappa B site within the PRDII domain of beta interferon. In this report, we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection. The 70-kDa protein corresponds to the NF-kappa B RelA (p65) subunit, which is activated in response to an acute paramyxovirus infection or a chronic HIV-1 infection. Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA (p65) or NFKB1 (p50) but rather affects the capacity of I kappa B alpha to sequester RelA (p65), therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-kappa B-dependent gene activity. The virally induced 90- to 100-kDa proteins have a distinct binding specificity for the PRDII domain and an AT-rich sequence but do not cross-react with NF-kappa B subunit-specific antisera directed against NFKB1 (p105 or p50), NFKB2 (p100 or p52), RelA (p65), or c-rel. DNA binding of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins was not inhibited by recombinant I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 and was resistant to tryptic digestion, suggesting that these proteins may not be NF-kappa B related. Transient cotransfection experiments demonstrated that RelA and NFKB1 expression maximally stimulated HIV-1 LTR- and NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes; differences in NF-kappa B-like binding activity were also reflected in higher constitutive levels of NF-kappa B-regulated gene expression in HIV-1-infected myeloid cell.
 plays important roles in metabolism, differentiation, and survival in T cells. TNFAIP3/A20 is a ubiquitin-editing enzyme that is thought to be a negative regulator of autophagy in cell lines. However, the role of TNFAIP3 in autophagy remains unclear. To determine whether TNFAIP3 regulates autophagy in CD4 T cells, we first analyzed Tnfaip3-deficient naïve CD4 T cells in vitro. We demonstrated that Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited reduced MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) puncta formation, increased mitochondrial content, and exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These results indicate that TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in CD4 T cells. We then investigated the mechanism by which TNFAIP3 promotes autophagy signaling. We found that TNFAIP3 bound to the MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complex and that Tnfaip3-deficient cells displayed enhanced ubiquitination of the MTOR complex and MTOR activity. To confirm the effects of enhanced MTOR activity in Tnfaip3-deficient cells, we analyzed cell survival following treatment with Torin1, an MTOR inhibitor. Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells exhibited fewer cell numbers than the control cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the impaired survival of Tnfaip3-deficient cells was ameliorated with Torin1 treatment in vitro and in vivo. The effect of Torin1 was abolished by Atg5 deficiency. Thus, enhanced MTOR activity regulates the survival of Tnfaip3-deficient CD4 T cells. Taken together, our findings illustrate that TNFAIP3 restricts MTOR signaling and promotes autophagy, providing new insight into the manner in which MTOR and autophagy regulate survival in CD4 T cell.
cts against pathologic vascular remodeling by inhibiting the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. A20's function has been attributed to ubiquitin editing of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) to influence activity/stability. The validity of this mechanism was tested using a murine model of transplant vasculopathy and human cells. Mouse C57BL/6 aortae transduced with adenoviruses containing A20 (or β-galactosidase as a control) were allografted into major histocompatibility complex-mismatched BALB/c mice. Primary endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or transformed epithelial cells (all human) were transfected with wild-type A20 or with catalytically inactive mutants as a control. NF-κB activity and intracellular localization of RIP1 was monitored by reporter gene assay, immunofluorescent staining, and Western blotting. Native and catalytically inactive versions of A20 had similar inhibitory effects on NF-κB activity (-70% vs. -76%; P &gt; 0.05). A20 promoted localization of RIP1 to insoluble aggresomes in murine vascular allografts and in human cells (53% vs. 0%) without altering RIP1 expression, and this process was increased by the assembly of polyubiquitin chains (87% vs. 28%; P &lt; 0.05). A20 captures polyubiquitinated signaling intermediaries in insoluble aggresomes, thus reducing their bioavailability for downstream NF-κB signaling. This novel mechanism contributes to protection from vasculopathy in transplanted organs treated with exogenous A2.
iate inflammasome activation contributes to multiple human diseases, but the mechanisms by which inflammasomes are suppressed are poorly understood. The NF-κB inhibitor A20 is a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme that might be critical in preventing human inflammatory diseases. Here, we report that A20-deficient macrophages, unlike normal cells, exhibit spontaneous NLRP3 inflammasome activity to LPS alone. The kinase RIPK3, but not the adaptor MyD88, is required for this response. In normal cells, A20 constitutively associates with caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β, and NLRP3 activation further promotes A20 recruitment to the inflammasome. Pro-IL-1β also co-immunoprecipitates with RIPK1, RIPK3, caspase-1, and caspase-8 in a complex that is modified with K63-linked and unanchored polyubiquitin. In A20-deficient macrophages, this pro-IL-1β-associated ubiquitination is markedly increased in a RIPK3-dependent manner. Mass spectrometric and mutational analyses reveal that K133 of pro-IL-1β is a physiological ubiquitination site that supports processing. Our study reveals a mechanism by which A20 prevents inflammatory disease.
 is a chronic inflammatory skin disease occurred under the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The genes HLA complex P5 (HCP5), spermatogenesis associated 2 (SPATA2), tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) and the component of oligomeric Golgi complex 6 (COG6) were reported to be associated with psoriasis in western populations by genome-wide association studies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the HCP5, TNIP1, TNFAIP3, SPATA2 and COG6 genes were genetic risk factors for psoriasis in Chinese population. One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from each gene was evaluated using Chinese patients with psoriasis (n = 201) and controls (n = 300). The results demonstrated that SNPs rs2395029, rs17728338 and rs610604 from the HCP5, TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 genes, respectively, were associated with psoriasis in the studied population at both genotype level and allelic level (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, the data suggested that HCP5, TNIP1 and TNFAIP3 may play a role in common pathogenic of psoriasis in Chinese and confer risk factors for psoriasis in various ethnic populations. These results provide potential makers for diagnosing, treating and preventing the psoriasi.
 E virus (HEV) is one of the primary causative agents of acute hepatitis, and represents a major cause of severe public health problems in developing countries. The pathogenesis of HEV is not well characterized, however, primarily due to the lack of well-defined cell and animal models. Here, we investigated the effects of genotype 1 HEV open reading frame 3 (ORF3) on TNF-α-induced nucleus factor-κappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were transiently transfected with ORF3 containing plasmids. These cells were then stimulated with TNF-α and the nucleus translocation of the p65 NF-κB subunit was assessed using western blot and laser confocal microscopy. DNA-binding activity of p65 was also examined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and the suppression of NF-κB target genes were detected using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. These results enabled us to identify the decreased phosphorylation levels of IKBα. We focused on the gene of negative regulation of NF-κB, represented by TNF-α-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20). Reducing the levels of A20 with siRNAs significantly enhances luciferase activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, HEV ORF3 regulated A20 primarily via activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), involved in unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in the degradation or inactivation of the receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), a major upstream activator of IKB kinase compounds (IKKs). Consequently, the phosphorylation of IKBα and the nucleus translocation of p65 are blocked, which contributes to diminished NF-κB DNA-binding activation and NF-κB-dependent gene expression. The findings suggest that genotype 1 HEV, through ORF3, may transiently activate NF-κB through UPR in early stage, and subsequently inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling in late phase so as to create a favorable virus replication environmen.
a gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against proteins of the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. The estimated number of MG patients is steadily increasing, and it had more than doubled in the last 20 years. Monozygotic MG twin concordance is estimated to be about 35% supporting the central role of environmental factors in MG etiology. Epigenetics, presume to be the mechanistic link between environmental and genetic risk factors in disease development, provides support for specific microRNAs associated with MG. Genetic studies have mainly pointed at specific HLA alleles implicated in MG susceptibility, however recently both TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) and tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) were indicated to be associated with MG in a GWAS study. A gender bias was observed for SNPs in the HLA-locus, suggesting female-specific alleles have an increase risk for MG. Moreover, sex hormones play a pivotal role in the gender bias in autoimmunity in general and in MG in particular. Hence the genetic basis of gender bias might be highly pertinent to MG and deserves further characterization. Pathway-based analyses that combine information across multiple genes into a limited number of molecular networks have been found to be a powerful approach. Both regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and NF-κB signaling pathway have been shown to have relevance to MG pathophysiology. Hence studies centered around two pathways might be a fruitful approach to identify additional polymorphisms associated with myasthenia gravi.
an important regulator of immunity and inflammation, and its activation pathway has been studied extensively. The mechanisms that downregulate the activity of NF-κB have also received a lot of attention, particularly since its activity needs to be terminated to prevent chronic inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. The COMMD family has been identified as a new group of proteins involved in NF-κB termination. All ten COMMD members share the structurally conserved carboxy-terminal motif, the COMM domain, and are ubiquitously expressed. They seem to play distinct and non-redundant roles in various physiological processes, including NF-κB signaling. In this review, we describe the mechanisms and proteins involved in the termination of canonical NF-κB signaling, with a specific focus on the role of the COMMD family in the down-modulation of NF-κ.
ing growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis in response to multiple stresses. In the present study, we investigated the role of TAK1 in cell death induced by heat stress (HS.
kdown HeLa cells and their parental cells were exposed to HS at 44 °C for 15, 30, 45 min followed by colony formation assay. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) induction, NF-κB phosphorylation, and caspase-3 cleavage were estimated by western blotting using specific antibodies. Global gene expression analysis was performed using the GeneChip® system. The anti-apoptotic roles of the identified genes were elucidated using small interfering RNAs targeting those gene.
itivity estimated by colony formation assay and caspase-3 cleavage increased in TAK1 knockdown cells. This sensitisation was not due to alterations in HSP induction or NF-κB phosphorylation as the expression levels of these proteins did not differ significantly between the TAK1 knockdown and the parent cells after HS exposure. The GeneChip® analysis revealed differences in gene expression between both cell variants after HS exposure and defined the genetic network associated with cell death. TNF-α interacting protein 3 (TNFAIP3) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) are two of the identified genes. RNA interference against these genes increased the cleavage of caspase-3 and cell death after HS exposur.
ngs reveal the role of TAK1 in thermoresistance and show that the mediation is independent of NF-κB phosphorylation but is dependent on TNFAIP3 and IL-8 inductio.
 multiple genetic associations have been found between genes involved in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune diseases. This study was undertaken to replicate some of these associations and further test for genetic interactions among these genes in SLE in a Chinese population. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NFKB1, REL, inhibitor of κB-like (IκBL), IκB kinase β (IKBKB), tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), tumor necrosis factor a-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) were genotyped in 898 Chinese patients with SLE and 988 healthy controls by Sequenom MassArray technology. Single-marker genetic association analysis was performed, and additive and multiplicative interactions were analyzed. Associations of TNFAIP3 rs2230926 (p=1.43 × 10(-3)) and TNIP1 rs10036748 (p=4.33 × 10(-3)) with SLE were replicated in our study. Two other SNPs, NFKB1 rs28362491 and IκBL rs2071592, showed nominal evidence for association (p=4.70 × 10(-2) and p=5.90 × 10(-3), respectively) but these were not significant after applying Bonferroni correction. Additive interaction analysis revealed significant interaction between NFKB1 rs28362491 and TNFAIP3 rs2230926 (RERI=0.98, 95%CI=0.02-1.93; AP=43.2%, 95%CI=0.12-0.74). Significant multiplicative interaction was observed between NFKB1 rs28362491 and TNIP1 rs3792783 (p=0.03). Our results provide evidence for gene-gene interactions, which further support the important role of NF-κB signaling pathway in the genetic basis of SLE and the notion of genetic interactions accounting for missing heritabilit.
 anti-inflammatory protein linked to multiple human autoimmune diseases and lymphomas. A20 possesses a deubiquitinating motif and a zinc finger, ZF4, that binds ubiquitin and supports its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. To understand how these activities mediate A20's physiological functions, we generated two lines of gene-targeted mice, abrogating either A20's deubiquitinating activity (Tnfaip3(OTU) mice) or A20's ZF4 (Tnfaip3(ZF4) mice). Both Tnfaip3(OTU) and Tnfaip3(ZF4) mice exhibited increased responses to TNF and sensitivity to colitis. A20's C103 deubiquitinating motif restricted both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). A20's ZF4 was required for recruiting A20 to&nbsp;ubiquitinated RIP1. A20(OTU) proteins and A20(ZF4) proteins complemented each other to regulate RIP1 ubiquitination and NFκB signaling normally in compound mutant Tnfaip3(OTU/ZF4) cells. This complementation involved homodimerization of A20 proteins, and we have defined an extensive dimerization interface in A20. These studies reveal how A20 proteins collaborate to restrict TNF signalin.
tudies in the last decade have highlighted the role of the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway, and particularly interferon alpha (IFNα) in SLE pathogenesis. As a result, a multitude of potential treatments targeting IFNα have emerged in the last few years, a few of which have already completed phase II clinical trials. Some of the treatment strategies have focused on blocking IFNα or its receptor and others the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC), which is the principal IFNα producing cell. In this review, we will discuss the evidence supporting a pathogenic role of IFNα and pDC in SLE, provide an update on the current status of these therapeutic strategies, and discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of each therapeutic approac.
de is significantly more effective in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells than all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The current study uses a genome-wide approach to understand the differential role fenretinide and ATRA have in inducing apoptosis in Huh7 cells. Fenretinide and ATRA-induced gene expressions and DNA bindings were profiled using microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-RXRα antibody. The data showed that fenretinide was not a strong transcription regulator. Fenretinide only changed the expressions of 1 093 genes, approximately three times less than the number of genes regulated by ATRA (2 811). Biological function annotation demonstrated that both fenretinide and ATRA participated in pathways that determine cell fate and metabolic processes. However, fenretinide specifically induced Fas/TNFα-mediated apoptosis by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes i.e., DEDD2, CASP8, CASP4, and HSPA1A/B; whereas, ATRA induced the expression of BIRC3 and TNFAIP3, which inhibit apoptosis by interacting with TRAF2. In addition, fenretinide inhibited the expression of the genes involved in RAS/RAF/ERK-mediated survival pathway. In contrast, ATRA increased the expression of SOSC2, BRAF, MEK, and ERK genes. Most genes regulated by fenretinide and ATRA were bound by RXRα, suggesting a direct effect. This study revealed that by regulating fewer genes, the effects of fenretinide become more specific and thus has fewer side effects than ATRA. The data also suggested that fenretinide induces apoptosis via death receptor effector and by inhibiting the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway. It provides insight on how retinoid efficacy can be improved and how side effects in cancer therapy can be reduce.
tive of this study is to comprehensively define the genetic basis of early onset myasthenia gravis (EOMG.
arried out a 2-stage genome-wide association study on a total of 649 North European EOMG patients. Cases were matched 1:4 with controls of European ancestry. We performed imputation and conditional analyses across the major histocompatibility complex, as well as in the top regions of association outside the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regio.
ed the strongest association in the HLA class I region at rs7750641 (p = 1.2 × 10(-92) ; odds ratio [OR], 6.25). By imputation and conditional analyses, HLA-B*08 proves to be the major associated allele (p = 2.87 × 10(-113) ; OR, 6.41). In addition to the expected association with PTPN22 (rs2476601; OR, 1.71; p = 8.2 × 10(-10) ), an imputed coding variant (rs2233290) at position 151 (Pro→Ala) in the TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1, TNIP1, confers even stronger risk than PTPN22 (OR, 1.91; p = 3.2 × 10(-10) .
iation at TNIP1 in EOMG implies disease mechanisms involving ubiquitin-dependent dysregulation of NF-κB signaling. The localization of the major HLA signal to the HLA-B*08 allele suggests that CD8(+) T cells may play a key role in disease initiation or pathogenesi.
d. TNFα-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) interacting with protein 1 (TNIP1) acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of immune system. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) showed that the polymorphism of TNIP1 was associated with the disease risk of SLE in Caucasian. In this study, we investigated whether the association of TNIP1 with SLE was replicated in Chinese population. Methods. The association of TNIP1 SNP rs7708392 (G/C) was determined by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis with unlabeled probe in 285 SLE patients and 336 healthy controls. Results. A new SNP rs79937737 located on 5 bp upstream of rs7708392 was discovered during the HRM analysis. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was found. Furthermore, rs7708392 and rs79937737 were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Hypotypes analysis of the two SNPs also showed no association with SLE in Chinese population. Conclusions. High resolution melting analysis with unlabeled probes proves to be a powerful and efficient genotyping method for identifying and screening SNPs. No association of rs7708392 or rs79937737 with the disease risk of SLE was observed in Chinese populatio.
ysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5) is a protein that is preferentially expressed in immune cells, and it interacts with the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases. Recent studies in T and B cells identified LAPTM5 as a negative regulator of T and B cell receptor levels at the plasma membrane. Here we investigated the function of LAPTM5 in macrophages. We demonstrate that expression of LAPTM5 is required for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in response to Toll-like receptor ligands. We also show that RAW264.7 cells knocked down for LAPTM5 or macrophages from LAPTM5(-/-) mice exhibit reduced activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways mediated by the TNF receptor, as well as multiple pattern recognition receptors in various cellular compartments. TNF stimulation of LAPTM5-deficient macrophages leads to reduced ubiquitination of RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1), suggesting a role for LAPTM5 at the receptor-proximate level. Interestingly, we find that macrophages from LAPTM5(-/-) mice display up-regulated levels of A20, a ubiquitin-editing enzyme responsible for deubiquitination of RIP1 and subsequent termination of NF-κB activation. Our studies thus indicate that, in contrast to its negative role in T and B cell activation, LAPTM5 acts as a positive modulator of inflammatory signaling pathways and hence cytokine secretion in macrophages. They also highlight a role for the endosomal/lysosomal system in regulating signaling via cytokine and pattern recognition receptor.
de association studies (GWASs) of asthma have consistently implicated the ORM1-like 3 and gasdermin B (ORMDL3-GSDMB), IL33, IL-1 receptor-like 1 and IL-18 receptor 1 (IL1RL1-IL18R1), RAD50-IL13, thymic stromal lymphopoietin and WD repeat domain 36 region (TSLP-WDR36), and HLA-DR/DQ region.
 asthma was performed in a non-Hispanic white populatio.
s performed in 813 Severe Asthma Research Program/Collaborative Studies on the Genetics of Asthma/Chicago Asthma Genetics Study cases and 1564 control subjects. The GWAS results were compared with those of the published GWASs of autoimmune disease.
single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) gene, which interacts with TNFAIP3 and inhibits the TNF-α-induced nuclear factor κB inflammation pathway, were associated with asthma: rs1422673 (P = 3.44 × 10(-7)) and rs10036748 (P = 1.41 × 10(-6), r(2) = 0.67). rs1422673 was also associated with asthma in the published GABRIEL (P = .018) and EVE (P = 1.31 × 10(-5)) studies. The minor allele T of rs20541 in IL13 is the risk allele for asthma but the protective allele for psoriasis. The minor allele T of rs2395185 in HLA-DRA is the risk allele for asthma but the protective allele for ulcerative colitis. The minor allele A of rs2872507 in GSDMB is the protective allele for asthma but the risk allele for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. The T allele of rs10036748 in the TNIP1 gene is the minor protective allele for asthma but the minor or major risk allele for systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis in non-Hispanic white or Chinese subjects, respectivel.
 suggests that single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with both asthma and autoimmune diseases might have opposite effects on immunopathogenesi.
elated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) apoptotic pathway has emerged as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. However, clinical trials have proven that the vast majority of human cancers are resistant to TRAIL apoptotic pathway-targeted therapies. We show that A20-mediated ubiquitination inhibits caspase-8 cleavage and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma through 2 signaling complexes. A20 is highly expressed in glioblastomas and, together with the death receptor 5 and receptor-interacting protein 1, forms a plasma membrane-bound preligand assembly complex under physiologic conditions. Treatment with TRAIL leads to the recruitment of caspase-8 to the plasma membrane-bound preligand assembly complex for the assembly of a death-inducing signaling complex. In the death-inducing signaling complex, the C-terminal zinc finger (Znf) domain of the A20 ubiquitin ligase mediates receptor-interacting protein 1 polyubiquitination through lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which bind to the caspase-8 protease domain and inhibit caspase-8 dimerization, cleavage, and the initiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma-derived cell lines and tumor-initiating cell.
ults identify A20 E3 ligase as a therapeutic target whose inhibition can overcome TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand resistance in glioblastoma and thus have an impact on ongoing clinical trials of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-targeted combination cancer therapie.
tive of this paper is to examine the role of NF-kappa B inhibitors A20 and ABIN-family proteins in the trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM)-induced model of tuberculous granulomatous lesion.
ce were twice injected i.p. with w/o/w emulsions that contain TDM at a 1&nbsp;week-interval. The mice were killed at days 0, 3, 7, 14, or 21 after the last injection. The mRNA and protein levels of A20 and ABIN-family proteins were measured by real-time PCR using mRNA or protein extract from the lesions. The activation status of NF-kappa B was analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Finally, the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated by anti-ABIN-3 antibody to identify the protein that potentially interacts with ABIN-.
ation of NF-kappa B pathway coincided with granuloma development, while A20 and ABIN-3 increased in accordance with granuloma regression. TAK-1 protein was co-precipitated with ABIN-3 by immunoprecipitation using anti-ABIN-3 antibod.
ts suggest that ABIN-3 contributed to granuloma regression by interacting with TAK-1 and, as a consequence, inhibiting activation of NF-kappa B pathwa.
singly wide range of functions, from repression of NF-κB signaling to protection from apoptosis, is being recognized for tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1). The authors recently demonstrated TNIP1 interaction with and repression of liganded retinoic acid receptors, distinguishing it from the more typical NCoR and SMRT corepressors, which function only in the absence of ligand. To improve their understanding of TNIP1's roles in physiologic and pathologic events, the authors examined its distribution in normal and malignant human tissues and cultured cells. They found cytoplasmic and nuclear TNIP1 in normal skin keratinocytes as it colocalized with retinoic acid receptor α, one of the nuclear receptors it corepresses. Nuclear and cytoplasmic TNIP1 was also found in the malignant keratinocytes of squamous cell carcinomas. Compared to adjacent normal tissues of other organs, TNIP1 staining and distribution varied with increased levels in esophageal cancer and marked decreases in prostate cancer. The varying levels and distribution of TNIP1 in normal and disease state tissues could be expected to affect processes in which TNIP1 is involved, such as NF-κB and nuclear receptor signaling, possibly contributing to the disease course or response to therapies targeting these key players of cell growth and differentiatio.
AIP3 interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) has diverse functions including support of HIV replication through its interaction with viral Nef and matrix proteins, reduction of TNFα-induced signaling through its interaction with NF-κB pathway proteins, and corepression of agonist-bound retinoic acid receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR). The wide tissue distribution of TNIP1 provides the opportunity to influence numerous cellular responses in these roles and defining control of TNIP1 expression would be central to improved understanding of its impact on cell function. We cloned 6kb of the human TNIP1 promoter and performed predictive and functional analyses to identify regulatory elements. The promoter region proximal to the transcription start site is GC-rich without a recognizable TATA box. In contrast to this proximal ~500bp region, 6kb of the promoter increased reporter construct constitutive activity over five-fold. Throughout the 6kb length, in silico analysis identified several potential binding sites for both constitutive and inducible transcription factors; among the latter were candidate NF-κB binding sequences and peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs). We tested NF-κB and PPAR regulation of the endogenous TNIP1 gene and cloned promoter by expression studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitations. We validated NF-κB sites in the TNIP1 promoter proximal and distal regions as well as one PPRE in the distal region. The ultimate control of the TNIP1 promoter is likely to be a combination of constitutive transcription factors and those subject to activation such as NF-κB and PPA.
lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common systemic autoimmune disease which likely involves complex interactions between genes and the environment. Two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many loci as genetic risk factors associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Among them there are a number of pSS associated gene polymorphisms including the MHC-II, STAT4, IRF5, BLK, and TNIP1 genes that are shared with SLE. However, the association of other genes such as GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and IL12A with SLE remain unknown. This study aimed to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GTF2I, GTF2IRD1 or IL12A genetically predispose a Chinese Han population to SL.
 in the GTF2I region (rs117026326), the GTF2IRD1 region (rs4717901), and the IL12A region (rs485497, rs583911) were genotyped in a cohort of 948 SLE patients and 938 healthy controls, using the polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) metho.
ncy of risk allele of rs117026326 was notably higher in SLE patients than in controls (37.2% vs. 14.9%, OR: 3.39, 95%CI: 2.89-3.97, pc =3.31×10-54). Similarly, rs4717901 was also associated with SLE (35.3% vs. 20.2%, OR: 2.16, 95%CI: 1.86-2.50, pc =1.50×10-24). The frequencies of alleles and genotypes of IL12A SNPs were not significantly different between the SLE patients and control.
y demonstrates a significant association between SLE and the GTF2I rs117026326 T allele, GTF2IRD1 rs4717901 C allele. The association of GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 as common genetic susceptibility factor in SLE will require further validation in other ethnic line.
 vulgaris is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease with a complex etiology involving genetic risk factors and environmental triggers. Here we describe the many known genetic predispositions of psoriasis with respect to immune genes and their encoded pathways in psoriasis susceptibility. These genes span an array of functions that involve antigen presentation (HLA-Cw6, ERAP1, ERAP2, MICA), the IL-23 axis (IL12Bp40, IL23Ap19, IL23R, JAK2, TYK2), T-cell development and T-cells polarization (RUNX1, RUNX3, STAT3, TAGAP, IL4, IL13), innate immunity (CARD14, c-REL, TRAF3IP2, DDX58, IFIH1), and negative regulators of immune responses (TNIP1, TNFAIP3, NFKBIA, ZC3H12C, IL36RN, SOCS1). The contribution of some of these gene products to psoriatic disease has also been revealed in recent years through targeting of key immune components, such as the Th17/IL-23 axis which has been highly successful in disease treatment. However, many of the genetic findings involve immune genes with less clear roles in psoriasis pathogenesis. This is particularly the case for those genes involved in innate immunity and negative regulation of immune specific pathways. It is possible that risk alleles of these genes decrease the threshold for the initial activation of the innate immune response. This could then lead to the onslaught of the pathogenic adaptive immune response known to be active in psoriatic skin. However, precisely how these various genes affect immunobiology need to be determined and some are speculated upon in this review. These novel genetic findings also open opportunities to explore novel therapeutic targets and potentially the development of personalized medicine, as well as discover new biology of human skin diseas.
 is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease involving both environmental and genetic factors. According to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the TNIP1 gene, which encodes the TNF-α-induced protein 3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1), is strongly linked to the susceptibility of psoriasis. TNIP1 is a widely expressed ubiquitin sensor that binds to the ubiquitin-editing protein A20 and restricts TNF- and TLR-induced signals. In our study, TNIP1 expression decreased in specimens of epidermis affected by psoriasis. Based on previous studies suggesting a role for TNIP1 in modulating cancer cell growth, we investigated its role in keratinocyte proliferation, which is clearly abnormal in psoriasis. To mimic the downregulation or upregulation of TNIP1 in HaCaT cells and primary human keratinocytes (PHKs), we used a TNIP1 specific small interfering hairpin RNA (TNIP1 shRNA) lentiviral vector or a recombinant TNIP1 (rTNIP1) lentiviral vector, respectively. Blocking TNIP1 expression increased keratinocyte proliferation, while overexpression of TNIP1 decreased keratinocyte proliferation. Furthermore, we showed that TNIP1 signaling might involve extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) activity. Intradermal injection of TNIP1 shRNA in BALB/c mice led to exaggerated psoriatic conditions in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis. These findings indicate that TNIP1 has a protective role in psoriasis and therefore could be a promising therapeutic targe.
de association studies (GWASs) have reproducibly associated ∼40 susceptibility loci with psoriasis. However, the missing heritability is evident and the contributions of coding variants have not yet been systematically evaluated. Here, we present a large-scale whole-exome array analysis for psoriasis consisting of 42,760 individuals. We discover 16 SNPs within 15 new genes/loci associated with psoriasis, including C1orf141, ZNF683, TMC6, AIM2, IL1RL1, CASR, SON, ZFYVE16, MTHFR, CCDC129, ZNF143, AP5B1, SYNE2, IFNGR2 and 3q26.2-q27 (P&lt;5.00 × 10(-08)). In addition, we also replicate four known susceptibility loci TNIP1, NFKBIA, IL12B and LCE3D-LCE3E. These susceptibility variants identified in the current study collectively account for 1.9% of the psoriasis heritability. The variant within AIM2 is predicted to impact protein structure. Our findings increase the number of genetic risk factors for psoriasis and highlight new and plausible biological pathways in psoriasi.
 is clinically heterogeneous, and symptoms can vary from mild almost cosmetic symptoms to severe disease requiring systemic therapy. Biomarkers predicting disease development are lacking. Herein we explored the genetic background in two polarized cohorts of carefully phenotyped patients with long-term follow-up: consistent mild phenotype (n=696) and severe disease course requiring systemic therapy (n=715). All patients were treated at the same dermatology department ensuring homogenous assessment. Genotyping included known psoriasis-associated variants, with special focus on the IL-23 and NF-κB pathways. A case-case study comparing severe and mild psoriasis phenotypes, controlling for age at disease onset and gender, revealed significant differences between the two groups for SNPs in IL23R, NFKB1, IL21, IL12B, NFKBIL1 and IL23A. HLA-C*06 associated equally in the mild and severe disease cohorts. Strong additive effects when combining HLA-C*06 with IL23A, IL23R, IL12B, NFKB1 or TNIP1 were restricted to the severe cohort, indicating that activation of these pathways may influence disease severity in psoriasis. No protective gene was identified in the mild cohort, suggesting that current screens have primarily identified psoriasis variants associated with a more severe phenotype. These results demonstrate the importance of careful phenotyping and long-term clinical follow-up in genetic studie.
c mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of interindividual lipid level variability and thus may contribute to the cardiovascular risk profile. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood lipid levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Observed DNA methylation changes were also further analyzed to examine their relationship with previous hospitalized myocardial infarctio.
de DNA methylation patterns were determined in whole blood samples of 1776 subjects of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F4 cohort using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Ten novel lipid-related CpG sites annotated to various genes including ABCG1, MIR33B/SREBF1, and TNIP1 were identified. CpG cg06500161, located in ABCG1, was associated in opposite directions with both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β coefficient=-0.049; P=8.26E-17) and triglyceride levels (β=0.070; P=1.21E-27). Eight associations were confirmed by replication in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg F3 study (n=499) and in the Invecchiare in Chianti, Aging in the Chianti Area study (n=472). Associations between triglyceride levels and SREBF1 and ABCG1 were also found in adipose tissue of the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource cohort (n=634). Expression analysis revealed an association between ABCG1 methylation and lipid levels that might be partly mediated by ABCG1 expression. DNA methylation of ABCG1 might also play a role in previous hospitalized myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval=1.06-1.25.
c modifications of the newly identified loci might regulate disturbed blood lipid levels and thus contribute to the development of complex lipid-related disease.
rmatitis and psoriasis are the two most common immune-mediated inflammatory disorders affecting the skin. Genome-wide studies demonstrate a high degree of genetic overlap, but these diseases have mutually exclusive clinical phenotypes and opposing immune mechanisms. Despite their prevalence, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis very rarely co-occur within one individual. By utilizing genome-wide association study and ImmunoChip data from &gt;19,000 individuals and methodologies developed from meta-analysis, we have identified opposing risk alleles at shared loci as well as independent disease-specific loci within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21.3), the Th2 locus control region (chromosome 5q31.1), and the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6p21-22). We further identified previously unreported pleiotropic alleles with opposing effects on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis risk in PRKRA and ANXA6/TNIP1. In contrast, there was no evidence for shared loci with effects operating in the same direction on both diseases. Our results show that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis have distinct genetic mechanisms with opposing effects in shared pathways influencing epidermal differentiation and immune response. The statistical analysis methods developed in the conduct of this study have produced additional insight from previously published data sets. The approach is likely to be applicable to the investigation of the genetic basis of other complex traits with overlapping and distinct clinical feature.
rthritis (SpA) represents a group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases that cluster within families and possess overlapping clinical features. The pathogenesis of SpA encompasses a complex array of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. In this article, we will briefly review the genetics of PsA, and then focus on the genes that may be potentially linked either directly or indirectly to the immunopathology of the Th-17 pathway. The most consistent and dominant genetic effect of PsV and PsA is located on chromosome 6p21.3 within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which accounts for approximately one-third of the genetic contribution of PsV and PsA. To date, 36 genes have reached genome-wide significance, accounting for approximately 22% of psoriasis (PsV) heritability. Prominent genes identified via GWAS include HLA-Cw6, IL12B, IL23R, IL23A, TNIP1, TNFAIP3, LCE3B-LCE3C, TRAF3IP2, NFkBIA, FBXL19, TYK2, IFIH1, REL, and ERAP1. Genes identified in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has largely echoed those in PsV and include HLA-B/C, HLA-B, IL-12B, IL-23R, TNIP1, TRAF3IP2, FBXL19, and REL. The lack of identified genetic susceptibility loci is largely attributed to the much smaller number of PsA patients and the greater clinical heterogeneity of PsA. Searching for different types of genetic variants such as small CNVs and/or insertions/deletions has also led to the identification of several genes with a function relative to PsV in particular including DEFB4, LCE3C_LCE3B, and IL-22 gene (exon 1). The candidate genes identified in PsV/PsA have highlighted pathways of critical importance to psoriatic disease including distinct signaling pathways comprised of barrier integrity, innate immune response and adaptive immune response, mediated primarily by Th-17 and Th-1 signalling. While GWAS studies have yielded great insights into the genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of PsV and PsA, replication in large cohorts, fine-mapping and resequencing efforts, together with functional studies of genetic variants identified, are warranted to better understand susceptibility to and progression of these diseases. That searching solely for common variants by GWAS will identify only a fraction of the entire genetic burden of disease, a concerted effort is underway to search for highly penetrant but rare disease alleles in families with PsV and PsA, using next-generation sequencing and through epigenetic investigation.
 is a common inflammatory and hyper proliferative condition of the skin and a serious chronic systemic autoimmune disease. We undertook an association study to investigate the genetic etiology of psoriasis in a Pakistani population by genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported to be associated in genome-wide association (GWAS) or in candidate gene studies of psoriasis. Fifty seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 42 loci were genotyped in 533 psoriasis patients and 373 controls. Our results showed genome wide significant association of the MHC region (rs1265181 being the most significant from five SNPs used with overall OR=3.38; p=2.97E-18), as well as nominally significant associations at ten other loci (p&lt;0.05) in the Pakistani population (LCE3B, REL, IL13/IL4, TNIP1, IL12B, TRAF3IP2, ZC3H12C, NOS2 and RNF114 from GWAS and PRR9 from a previous candidate gene study). Overall, only nine SNPs out of the 42 GWAS loci, displayed an odds ratio in the opposite allelic direction and only three did not reach similar odds ratio within 95% confidence interval as previously reported (SLC45A1/TNFRSF9, ELMO1 and IL28RA). This indicates similar genetic risk factors and molecular mechanisms behind disease in Pakistani psoriasis patients as in other populations. In addition, we show that the MHC and TNIP1 regions are significantly different in patients with psoriasis onset before the age of 40 (type I) compared to after 40 years of age (type II). MHC being associated mainly with type I while TNIP1 with type II patient.
ced protein 3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) represses signaling pathways initiated by specific nuclear and transmembrane receptors. This effect results in reduced activity of distinct transcription factors such as retinoic acid receptors (RAR), peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), and NFκB. TNIP1-null and TNIP1-knockin defective for ubiquitin-binding mice show increased liver apoptosis, and enlarged spleen and lymph nodes, respectively. To complement current knowledge of TNIP1's broad physiologic functions as interpreted from in vivo studies and specific expression consequences from transcription factor repression, we determined effects of excess TNIP1 on global gene regulation. Following experimentally increased expression of TNIP1 in cultured keratinocytes, our gene expression microarray analysis not only confirmed TNIP1's association in previously known pathways and functions but also found a novel TNIP1-regulated pathway - the cell stress response. Under standard culture conditions, expression of several heat shock proteins, including HSPA1A, HSPA6, DNAJA1 and DNAJB1, was reduced. In heat-stressed conditions, differential regulation of HSPA1A and HSPA6 was observed, where only HSPA6 expression was reduced after heat-shock. Using HSPA6 as a model to elucidate the mechanism of the TNIP1-mediated HSP repression, we determined that TNIP1 likely represses HSPs through factors other than RAR, PPAR or NFκB despite the presence of these factors' binding sites in the HSPA6 promoter. These results indicate that regulation of HSPs may be through a yet unknown TNIP1-associated pathway. Additionally, these results suggest that TNIP1's reduction of HSP expression levels could negatively impact HSP chaperone capacity or their participation in the cell stress respons.
 disease is an episodic vestibular syndrome associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and tinnitus. Patients with MD have an elevated prevalence of several autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis), which suggests a shared autoimmune background. Functional variants of several genes involved in the NF-κB pathway, such as REL, TNFAIP3, NFKB1 and TNIP1, have been associated with two or more immune-mediated diseases and allelic variations in the TLR10 gene may influence bilateral affectation and clinical course in MD. We have genotyped 716 cases of MD and 1628 controls by using the ImmunoChip, a high-density genotyping array containing 186 autoimmune loci, to explore the association of immune system related-loci with sporadic MD. Although no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reached a genome-wide significant association (p&lt;10(-8)), we selected allelic variants in the NF-kB pathway for further analyses to evaluate the impact of these SNPs in the clinical outcome of MD in our cohort. None of the selected SNPs increased susceptibility for MD in patients with uni or bilateral SNHL. However, two potential regulatory variants in the NFKB1 gene (rs3774937 and rs4648011) were associated with a faster hearing loss progression in patients with unilateral SNHL. So, individuals with unilateral MD carrying the C allele in rs3774937 or G allele in rs4648011 had a shorter mean time to reach hearing stage 3 (&gt;40 dB HL) (log-rank test, corrected p values were p = 0.009 for rs3774937 and p = 0.003 for rs4648011, respectively). No variants influenced hearing in bilateral MD. Our data support that the allelic variants rs3774937 and rs4648011 can modify hearing outcome in patients with MD and unilateral SNH.
sclerosis (SSc) is a fibrotic and autoimmune disease characterized clinically by skin and internal organ fibrosis and vascular damage, and serologically by the presence of circulating autoantibodies. Although etiopathogenesis is not yet well understood, the results of numerous genetic association studies support genetic contributions as an important factor to SSc. In this paper, the major genes of SSc are reviewed. The most recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are taken into account along with robust candidate gene studies. The literature search was performed on genetic association studies of SSc in PubMed between January 2000 and March 2014 while eligible studies generally had over 600 total participants with replication. A few genetic association studies with related functional changes in SSc patients were also included. A total of forty seven genes or specific genetic regions were reported to be associated with SSc, although some are controversial. These genes include HLA genes, STAT4, CD247, TBX21, PTPN22, TNFSF4, IL23R, IL2RA, IL-21, SCHIP1/IL12A, CD226, BANK1, C8orf13-BLK, PLD4, TLR-2, NLRP1, ATG5, IRF5, IRF8, TNFAIP3, IRAK1, NFKB1, TNIP1, FAS, MIF, HGF, OPN, IL-6, CXCL8, CCR6, CTGF, ITGAM, CAV1, MECP2, SOX5, JAZF1, DNASEIL3, XRCC1, XRCC4, PXK, CSK, GRB10, NOTCH4, RHOB, KIAA0319, PSD3 and PSOR1C1. These genes encode proteins mainly involved in immune regulation and inflammation, and some of them function in transcription, kinase activity, DNA cleavage and repair. The discovery of various SSc-associated genes is important in understanding the genetics of SSc and potential pathogenesis that contribute to the development of this diseas.
studies have identified 41 independent genome-wide significant psoriasis susceptibility loci. After our first psoriasis genome-wide association study, we designed a custom genotyping array to fine-map eight genome-wide significant susceptibility loci known at that time (IL23R, IL13, IL12B, TNIP1, MHC, TNFAIP3, IL23A and RNF114) enabling genotyping of 2269 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the eight loci for 2699 psoriasis cases and 2107 unaffected controls of European ancestry. We imputed these data using the latest 1000 Genome reference haplotypes, which included both indels and SNPs, to increase the marker density of the eight loci to 49 239 genetic variants. Using stepwise conditional association analysis, we identified nine independent signals distributed across six of the eight loci. In the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, we detected three independent signals at rs114255771 (P = 2.94 × 10(-74)), rs6924962 (P = 3.21 × 10(-19)) and rs892666 (P = 1.11 × 10(-10)). Near IL12B we detected two independent signals at rs62377586 (P = 7.42 × 10(-16)) and rs918518 (P = 3.22 × 10(-11)). Only one signal was observed in each of the TNIP1 (rs17728338; P = 4.15 × 10(-13)), IL13 (rs1295685; P = 1.65 × 10(-7)), IL23A (rs61937678; P = 1.82 × 10(-7)) and TNFAIP3 (rs642627; P = 5.90 × 10(-7)) regions. We also imputed variants for eight HLA genes and found that SNP rs114255771 yielded a more significant association than any HLA allele or amino-acid residue. Further analysis revealed that the HLA-C*06-B*57 haplotype tagged by this SNP had a significantly higher odds ratio than other HLA-C*06-bearing haplotypes. The results demonstrate allelic heterogeneity at IL12B and identify a high-risk MHC class I haplotype, consistent with the existence of multiple psoriasis effectors in the MH.
f the study was to investigate the association of TNFα-induced protein 3 interacting with protein 1 (TNIP1) gene polymorphisms with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome and Behcet's disease (BD) in a Han Chinese populatio.
f 656 BD patients, 961 VKH syndrome patients and 1534 healthy controls were included in this two-stage case control study. Seven SNPs, including rs17728338, rs7708392, rs10036748, rs3762999, rs999556, rs4958881 and rs3792783, belonging to TNIP1 were genotyped and analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The data were analyzed by using the χ2 or Fisher's exact test and corrected for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni metho.
cantly increased frequency of the GG genotype and a decreased frequency of the AG genotype of rs17728338 were found in VKH patients (Pc = 0.038 OR = 1.934, 95% CI  = 1.438 ∼ 2.601). No significant difference was noted in allele or genotype frequencies of rs7708392, rs10036748, rs3762999, rs999556, rs4958881 and rs3792783, between VKH patients and healthy controls (Pc&gt;0.05). No significant difference was noted in allele or genotype frequencies of the tested 7 SNPs between BD patients and healthy controls. Analysis of extraocular clinical findings, did not reveal an association of the TNIP1 gene polymorphisms with BD or VKH syndrome subgroup.
olymorphism may be a risk factor for VKH syndrome in Han Chines.
ns for the ethnic disparities in the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the relative high frequency of SLE risk alleles in the population are not fully understood. Population genetic factors such as natural selection alter allele frequencies over generations and may help explain the persistence of such common risk variants in the population and the differential risk of SLE. In order to better understand the genetic basis of SLE that might be due to natural selection, a total of 74 genomic regions with compelling evidence for association with SLE were tested for evidence of recent positive selection in the HapMap and HGDP populations, using population differentiation, allele frequency, and haplotype-based tests. Consistent signs of positive selection across different studies and statistical methods were observed at several SLE-associated loci, including PTPN22, TNFSF4, TET3-DGUOK, TNIP1, UHRF1BP1, BLK, and ITGAM genes. This study is the first to evaluate and report that several SLE-associated regions show signs of positive natural selection. These results provide corroborating evidence in support of recent positive selection as one mechanism underlying the elevated population frequency of SLE risk loci and supports future research that integrates signals of natural selection to help identify functional SLE risk allele.
hritis is a cause of significant morbidity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its genetic background has not been completely clarified. The aim of this investigation was to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with lupus nephritis, its severe form proliferative nephritis and renal outcome, in two Swedish cohorts. Cohort I (n = 567 SLE cases, n = 512 controls) was previously genotyped for 5676 SNPs and cohort II (n = 145 SLE cases, n = 619 controls) was genotyped for SNPs in STAT4, IRF5, TNIP1 and BLK. Case-control and case-only association analyses for patients with lupus nephritis, proliferative nephritis and severe renal insufficiency were performed. In the case-control analysis of cohort I, four highly linked SNPs in STAT4 were associated with lupus nephritis with genome wide significance with p = 3.7 × 10(-9), OR 2.20 for the best SNP rs11889341. Strong signals of association between IRF5 and an HLA-DR3 SNP marker were also detected in the lupus nephritis case versus healthy control analysis (p &lt;0.0001). An additional six genes showed an association with lupus nephritis with p &lt;0.001 (PMS2, TNIP1, CARD11, ITGAM, BLK and IRAK1). In the case-only meta-analysis of the two cohorts, the STAT4 SNP rs7582694 was associated with severe renal insufficiency with p = 1.6 × 10(-3) and OR 2.22. We conclude that genetic variations in STAT4 predispose to lupus nephritis and a worse outcome with severe renal insufficienc.
a gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mediated by the presence of autoantibodies that bind to components of the neuromuscular junction, causing the symptoms of muscular weakness and fatigability. Like most autoimmune disorders, MG is a multifactorial, noninherited disease, though with an established genetic constituent. The heterogeneity observed in MG perplexes genetic analysis even more, as it occurs in various levels, including diverse autoantigens, thymus histopathology, and age at onset. In this context of distinct subgroups, a plethora of association studies, discussed in this review, have assessed the involvement of various HLA and non-HLA related loci in MG susceptibility, over the past five years. As expected, certain HLA alleles were strongly associated with MG. Many of the non-HLA genes, such as PTPN22 and CTLA-4, have been previously studied in MG and other autoimmune diseases and their association with MG has been reevaluated in more cohesive groups of patients. Moreover, novel risk or protective loci have been revealed, as in the case of TNIP1 and FOXP3. Although the majority of these results have been derived from candidate gene studies, the focal point of all recent genetic studies is the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted on early-onset MG patient.
 syndrome is a common autoimmune disease (affecting ∼0.7% of European Americans) that typically presents as keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Here we report results of a large-scale association study of Sjögren's syndrome. In addition to strong association within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region at 6p21 (Pmeta = 7.65 × 10(-114)), we establish associations with IRF5-TNPO3 (Pmeta = 2.73 × 10(-19)), STAT4 (Pmeta = 6.80 × 10(-15)), IL12A (Pmeta = 1.17 × 10(-10)), FAM167A-BLK (Pmeta = 4.97 × 10(-10)), DDX6-CXCR5 (Pmeta = 1.10 × 10(-8)) and TNIP1 (Pmeta = 3.30 × 10(-8)). We also observed suggestive associations (Pmeta &lt; 5 × 10(-5)) with variants in 29 other regions, including TNFAIP3, PTTG1, PRDM1, DGKQ, FCGR2A, IRAK1BP1, ITSN2 and PHIP, among others. These results highlight the importance of genes that are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity in Sjögren's syndrom.
 motif is the defining feature of the TRIM family of proteins, characterized by a RING finger-B-box-coiled coil tripartite fold. We have elucidated the crystal structure of B-box 2 (B2) from MuRF1, a TRIM protein that supports a wide variety of protein interactions in the sarcomere and regulates the trophic state of striated muscle tissue. MuRF1 B2 coordinates two zinc ions through a cross-brace alpha/beta-topology typical of members of the RING finger superfamily. However, it self-associates into dimers with high affinity. The dimerization pattern is mediated by the helical component of this fold and is unique among RING-like folds. This B2 reveals a long shallow groove that encircles the C-terminal metal binding site ZnII and appears as the defining protein-protein interaction feature of this domain. A cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues in this groove and, in particular, a highly conserved aromatic residue (Y133 in MuRF1 B2) is likely to be central to this role. We expect these findings to aid the future exploration of the cellular function and therapeutic potential of MuRF.
lum brasilense is a diazotroph that associates with important agricultural crops and thus has potential to be a nitrogen biofertilizer. The A. brasilense transcription regulator NifA, which seems to be constitutively expressed, activates the transcription of nitrogen fixation genes. It has been suggested that the nitrogen status-signaling protein GlnB regulates NifA activity by direct interaction with the NifA N-terminal GAF domain, preventing the inhibitory effect of this domain under conditions of nitrogen fixation. In the present study, we show that an N-terminal truncated form of NifA no longer required GlnB for activity and lost regulation by ammonium. On the other hand, in trans co-expression of the N-terminal GAF domain inhibited the N-truncated protein in response to fixed nitrogen levels. We also used pull-down assays to show in vitro interaction between the purified N-terminal GAF domain of NifA and the GlnB protein. The results showed that A. brasilense GlnB interacts directly with the NifA N-terminal domain and this interaction is dependent on the presence of ATP and 2-oxoglutarat.
protein from Azotobacter vinelandii belongs to a family of enhancer binding proteins (EBPs) that activate transcription by RNA polymerase containing the sigma factor sigma(54). These proteins have conserved AAA+ domains that catalyse ATP hydrolysis to drive conformational changes necessary for open complex formation by sigma(54)-RNA polymerase. The activity of the NifA protein is highly regulated in response to redox and fixed nitrogen through interaction with the antiactivator protein NifL. Binding of NifL to NifA inhibits the ATPase activity of NifA, and this interaction is controlled by the amino-terminal GAF domain of NifA that binds 2-oxoglutarate. Mutations conferring resistance to NifL are located in both the GAF and the AAA+ domains of NifA. To investigate the mechanism by which the GAF domain regulates the activity of the AAA+ domain, we screened for second-site mutations that suppress the NifL-resistant phenotype of mutations in the AAA+ domain. One suppressor mutation, F119S, in the GAF domain restores inhibition by NifL to an AAA+ domain mutation, E356K, in response to fixed nitrogen but not in response to oxygen. The biochemical properties of this mutant protein are consistent with the in vivo phenotype and demonstrate that interdomain suppression results in sensitivity to inhibition by NifL in the presence of the signal transduction protein GlnK, but not to the oxidized form of NifL. In the absence of an AAA+ domain mutation, the F119S mutation confers hypersensitivity to repression by NifL. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that this mutation prevents binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the GAF domain. Our data support a model in which the GAF domain plays an essential role in preventing inhibition by NifL under conditions appropriate for nitrogen fixation. These observations are of general significance in considering how the activities of EBPs are controlled in response to environmental signal.
romyces cerevisiae, the existence of PYC1 and PYC2 encoding cytosolic pyruvate carboxylase isoform I and II is rather puzzling, owing to the lack of potent differential gene regulation by the carbon sources. We report several findings indicating that these two genes are differentially regulated by the nature of the nitrogen source. In wild-type cells, the activity of pyruvate carboxylase, which is the sum of pyruvate carboxylase isoform I and II, was two- to fivefold lower in carbon medium containing aspartate, asparagine, glutamate or glutamine instead of ammonium as the nitrogen source, whereas it was 1.5- to threefold higher when the ammonium source was substituted by arginine, methionine, threonine or leucine. These enzymatic changes were independent of the nature of the carbon source and closely correlated to the changes in beta-galactosidase from PYC1-lacZ gene fusion and in PYC1 transcripts. Transfer of exponentially growing cells of the pyc2 mutant from an aspartate or a glutamate medium to an ammonium medium caused a fivefold increase in PYC1 mRNA in less than 30 min, whereas in the inverse experiment, PYC1 transcripts returned within 30 min to the low levels found in aspartate/glutamate medium. By contrast, these conditions affected neither the pyruvate carboxylase activity encoded by PYC2 nor PYC2 mRNA. Considering that changes in PYC1 expression inversely correlated with changes in alpha-ketoglutarate concentration or in alpha-ketoglutarate/glutamate ratio following the nitrogen shift experiments, and taking into account the pivotal role of this metabolite in ammonium assimilation, it is suggested that changes in alpha-ketoglutarate or in the alpha-ketoglutarate/glutamate ratio might be implicated in triggering the nitrogen effects on PYC1 expression. The physiological significance of the differential sensitivity of PYC1 and PYC2 genes with respect to the nitrogen source in the growth medium is also discusse.
tarate--unlike any other derivative of the citric acid cycle--was found to strongly repress catabolite-sensitive genes, such as the lactose operon (lac) or the tryptophanase gene (tna), when added to cells grown in glycerol. 2-ketoglutarate affects the expression of these genes by decreasing cyclic AMP synthesis. Such inhibition of cyclic AMP synthesis requires the presence of enzyme III, a component of the phosphoenol pyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). Thus, it is proposed that 2-ketoglutarate is one of the catabolite repressors postulated by Magasanik in 1961. In addition, by studying the effect of 2-ketoglutarate in various mutants, we show the existence of a cyclic AMP-independent catabolite repression mechanism whose mediator is synthesized from 2-ketoglutarat.
nt status of catabolite repression is summarized with respect to the involvement of cyclic AMP and other mediators. A model is presented which may account for the relationship between positive control of gene expression exerted by cAMP and its receptor, CAP, and negative control of catabolite repression mediated by specific metabolite.
ease (FD) was an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency in glycosphingolipid catabolism caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase A gene GLA. Variant FD patients did not present with classical symptoms during childhood and were undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other kidney diseases, such as chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN). In this study, we utilized exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified the variation p.E66Q of GLA completely co-segregated with the disease phenotype in a Chinese family, which previously been diagnosed as possible CGN. Female patients exhibited preferential X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) of the normal p.E66 allele, as indicated by XCI analysis. By measuring α-Gal A activity, we found that male patients in the pedigree had just little enzymatic activity while female patients had residual enzymatic activity. These patients were diagnosed with renal variant FD in subsequent clinical review. Our results directly implicated the GLA mutation p.E66Q as the genetic etiology of the Chinese renal variant FD pedigre.
ease is an X-linked glycosphingolipidosis caused by deficient synthesis of the enzyme α-galactosidase A, which results in accumulations of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in systemic tissues. Nephropathy is a dominant feature of Fabry disease. It still remains unclear how the nephropathy progresses. Recombinant agalsidase replacement therapy is currently the only approved, specific therapy for Fabry disease. The optimal dose of replacement enzyme also still remains unclear. The worldwide shortage of agalsidase-β in 2009 forced dose reduction of administration. It showed that the proteinuria emerged like surges, followed by temporary plasma GL-3 elevations in the early stages of classic Fabry disease. Additionally, it also showed that 1&nbsp;mg/kg of agalsidase-β every other week could clear the GL-3 accumulations from podocytes and was required to maintain negative proteinuria and normal plasma GL-3 level.
rvation of a young patient with classic Fabry disease about 5&nbsp;years reveals that the long-term, low-dose agalsidase-β caused proteinuria surges, but not persistent proteinuria, followed by temporary plasma GL-3 elevations, and agalsidase-β at 1&nbsp;mg/kg every other week could clear accumulated GL-3 from podocytes and was required to maintain normal urinalysis and plasma GL-3 levels. What is Known: • Patients with Fabry disease show GL-3 accumulations in podocytes and foot process effacement without proteinuria. • The optimal dose of replacement enzyme (agalsidase-α or -β) remains unclear. What is New: • The long-term, low-dose agalsidase-β caused proteinuria surge, but not persistent proteinuria, followed by temporary plasma GL-3 elevations • Agalsidase-β at 1&nbsp;mg/kg every other week could clear accumulated GL-3 from podocytes, and was required to maintain normal urinalysis and normal plasma GL-3 level.
ns act as a powerful, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent and are known to kill over 650 different kinds of pathogens. We investigated the protein expression pattern and identity after silver ion treatment in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, which are primarily responsible for the majority of bovine mastitis cases using proteomics. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that silver ion treatment significantly reduced 5 spot's density in E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. We identified 10 proteins (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C22 subunit, phosphoglucomutase, fructose-1-phosphate kinase, putative carbamoyl transferase, alpha-galactosidase, carbamate kinase, ornithine transcarbamoylase, fumarate hydratase class II, alcohol dehydrogenase, and conserved hypothetical protein) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF). These results demonstrated that silver ions have bactericidal effects through energy deprivation, inhibition of DNA replication, and accumulation of oxidants in bovine mastitis pathogens and suggested that silver ions can be applied for the treatment of bovine mastiti.
-old man was admitted to our hospital due to gait difficulty. Brain imaging indicated bilateral pulvinar lesions and moderate white matter lesions. The serum α-galactosidase A levels were measured for the differential diagnosis of bilateral pulvinar lesions and were found to be abnormally low. Therefore, the patient was suspected to have variant Fabry disease. A GLA mutation analysis showed the p.E66Q mutation, which is speculated to be a functional polymorphism rather than a disease-causing mutation of Fabry disease. Enzyme replacement therapy did not result in a marked improvement, however, the disease progression stoppe.
y investigated whether multiple bioactivity of terrein such as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant inhibits age-related inflammation by promoting an antioxidant response in aged human diploid fibroblast (HDF) cells. HDF cells were cultured serially for in vitro replicative senescence. To create the ageing cell phenotype, intermediate stage (PD31) HDF cells were brought to stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) using hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ). Terrein increased cell viability even with H2 O2 stress and reduced inflammatory molecules such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Terrein reduced also phospho-extracellular kinase receptor1/2 (p-EKR1/2) signalling in aged HDF cells. SIPS cells were attenuated for age-related biological markers including reactive oxygen species (ROS), senescence associated beta-galactosidase (SA β-gal.) and the aforementioned inflammatory molecules. Terrein induced the induction of anti-oxidant molecules, copper/zinc-superoxide defence (Cu/ZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in SIPS cells. Terrein also alleviated reactive oxygen species formation through the Nrf2/HO-1/p-ERK1/2 pathway in aged cells. The results indicate that terrein has an alleviative function of age-related inflammation characterized as an anti-oxidant. Terrein might be a useful nutraceutical compound for anti-ageing.

ease (FD) is a rare metabolic disorder of glycosphingolipid storage caused by mutations in the GLA gene encoding lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A (α-gal A). Recently, the diagnostic procedure for FD has advanced in several ways, through the development of a specific biomarker (lyso-Gb3) and the implementation of newborn screenings, which acted as a catalyst to augment general awareness of the disease. Heterologous over-expression of α-gal A variants and subsequent in vitro measurement of enzyme activity provided molecular data to elucidate the relationship between mutation, enzyme damage, lyso-Gb3 biomarker levels and clinical phenotype. This knowledge is the foundation for improved counselling with regard to prognosis and therapeutic decisions. Herein, we resume the approach of in vitro characterization, with a further 73 mainly novel GLA gene mutations. Patient lyso-Gb3 data were available for most of the mutations. All mutations were tested for responsiveness to pharmacological chaperone treatment and phenotypic data for 61 hemizygous male and 116 heterozygous female patients carrying a mutation associated with ≥ 20% residual activity, formerly classified as &quot;mild&quot; variant, were collected in order to evaluate the pathogenicity. We conclude that a mild GLA variant is typically characterized by high residual enzyme activity and normal biomarker levels. We found evidence that these variants can still be classified as a distinctive, but milder, sub-type of FD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserve.
 approach is reported for the design of small-molecule competitive inhibitors of lysosomal glycosidases programmed to 1) promote correct folding of mutant enzymes at the endoplasmic reticulum, 2) facilitate trafficking, and 3) undergo dissociation and self-inactivation at the lysosome. The strategy is based on the incorporation of an orthoester segment into iminosugar conjugates to switch the nature of the aglycone moiety from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in the pH 7 to pH 5 window, which has a dramatic effect on the enzyme binding affinity. As a proof of concept, new highly pH-responsive glycomimetics targeting human glucocerebrosidase or α-galactosidase with strong potential as pharmacological chaperones for Gaucher or Fabry disease, respectively, were develope.
ease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder of glycosphingolipids, caused by the partial or complete deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (a-Gal A). The missense mutation pN215S usually causes a milder form of the disease with isolated cardiac involvement. We report a case of a male Fabry patient with the pN215S mutation and a generalized disease. He suffered a relapse in proteinuria which responded to increased doses of the administered recombinant enzyme. Individualization of enzyme replacement therapy must be considered in selected cases characterized by clinical deterioratio.
l inflammation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including diabetes, Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Important components of inflammation are interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which are elevated both on the luminal and submucosal sides of the intestinal epithelial barrier in several diseases. Here, we developed a novel E.coli based detection system for IFN-γ and TNF-α comprised of a chimeric protein and a simple signal transduction construct, which could be deployed on the luminal side of the intestine. OmpA of E. coli was engineered to detect IFN-γ or TNF-α through the replacement of extracellular loops with peptide fragments from OprF of P. aeruginosa. OmpA/OprF chimeras were developed, capable of binding IFN-γ or TNF-α. The specific peptide fragments that bind IFN-γ were identified. IFN-γ or TNF-α binding the OmpA/OprF chimera induced the pspA promoter, driving β-galactosidase production. The OmpA/OprF chimera had a detection limit of 300 pM for IFN-γ and 150 pM for TNF-α. This work will further the development of bacteria based therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the gut. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserve.
ive α-D-galactosidases (α-GALs) belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 27, and originating from the rather unexplored bacterial strain Pedobacter heparinus, were cloned and biochemically characterized. The recombinant enzymes designated as PhAGal729 and PhAGal2920 showed comparable biochemical properties: the optimum pH values were determined to be pH 5.0 and 5.5, and temperature optima lay between 30°C and 37°C, respectively. Both α-GALs were not dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, and the addition of EDTA had no influence on enzymatic activity. The activity of both enzymes substantially increased in the presence of Fe3+ ions. Both enzymes were inhibited by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea. α-GALs from P. heparinus were highly specific in hydrolyzing glycosides with α-1,2/3/4 or α-1,6-linked galactose to other sugars, whereas other glycosides such as α-linked N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine or glucose residues were not released. Nevertheless, neither PhAGal729 nor PhAGal2920 were able to remove α-linked galactose epitopes from native human erythrocytes. The facile expression and purification procedures in combination with wide substrate specificities make α-GALs from P. heparinus potential candidates for applications in analytical research, and food- and biotechnolog.
uclein (αSyn) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Recent multicenter genetic studies have revealed that mutations in the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gene, which are responsible for Gaucher's disease, are strong risk factors for PD and DLB. However, the mechanistic link between the functional loss of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and the toxicity of αSyn in vivo is not fully understood. In this study, we employed Drosophila models to examine the effect of GCase deficiency on the neurotoxicity of αSyn and its molecular mechanism. Behavioral and histological analyses showed that knockdown of the Drosophila homolog of GBA1 (dGBA1) exacerbates the locomotor dysfunction, loss of dopaminergic neurons and retinal degeneration of αSyn-expressing flies. This phenotypic aggravation was associated with the accumulation of proteinase K (PK)-resistant αSyn, rather than with changes in the total amount of αSyn, raising the possibility that glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a substrate of GCase, accelerates the misfolding of αSyn. Indeed, in vitro experiments revealed that GlcCer directly promotes the conversion of recombinant αSyn into the PK-resistant form, representing a toxic conformational change. Similar to dGBA1 knockdown, knockdown of the Drosophila homolog of β-galactosidase (β-Gal) also aggravated locomotor dysfunction of the αSyn flies, and its substrate GM1 ganglioside accelerated the formation of PK-resistant αSyn. Our findings suggest that the functional loss of GCase or β-Gal promotes the toxic conversion of αSyn via aberrant interactions between αSyn and their substrate glycolipids, leading to the aggravation of αSyn-mediated neurodegeneratio.
ysfunction of Fabry disease (FD) has been associated with myofilament damage and cell death as result of α-galactosidase A deficiency and globotriaosylceramide accumulation. We sought to evaluate the role of oxidative stress in FD cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Myocardial tissue from 18 patients with FD was investigated for the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine by immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis for nitrotyrosine was also performed. Oxidative damage to DNA was investigated by immunostaining for 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), whereas apoptosis was evaluated by in situ ligation with hairpin probes. iNOS and nitrotyrosine expression was increased in FD hearts compared with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and normal controls. Remarkably, immunostaining was homogeneously expressed in FD male cardiomyocytes, whereas it was only detected in the affected cardiomyocytes of FD females. Western blot analysis confirmed an increase in FD cardiomyocyte protein nitration compared with controls. 8-OHdG was expressed in 25% of cardiomyocyte nuclei from FD patients, whereas it was absent in controls. The intensity of immunostaining for iNOS/nitrotyrosine correlated with 8-OHdG expression in cardiomyocyte nuclei. Apoptosis of FD cardiomyocytes was 187-fold higher than in controls, and apoptotic nuclei were positive for 8-OHdG. Cardiac dysfunction of FD reflects increased myocardial nitric oxide production with oxidative damage of cardiomyocyte myofilaments and DNA, causing cell dysfunction and deat.
ease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by α-galactosidase A deficiency and leads to accumulation of glycospinhgolipids in most tissues, with life-theratening consequences in the kidney, heart, and cerebrovascular system. Enzyme replacement therapy is available as 2 different preparations: agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta. Enzyme replacement therapy is started as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, but there is no data available in the literature about its safety during preganacy. Herein, we described 2 patients with Fabry disease who received agalsidase beta during their pregnancy. This report is important as the data about enzyme replacement therapy during pregnancy is restricted with case report.
ease is an X-linked recessive glycosphingolipid storage disorder caused by a deficiency of lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A. It is recognized that Fabry disease patients often have ventricular arrhythmias. Although the effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with ventricular fibrillation is established, there is little evidence regarding ICD therapy for Fabry disease. Here, we report the case of patient with Fabry disease who was treated with an ICD and presented with high defibrillation threshold.
ion of galactosphingolipids is a general characteristic of Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficient activity of α-galactosidase A encoded by the GLA gene. Although many polymorphic GLA haplotypes have been described, it is still unclear whether some of these variants are causative of disease symptoms. We report the study of an inheritance of a complex intronic haplotype (CIH) (c.-10C &gt; T, c.369 + 990C &gt; A, c.370-81_370-77delCAGCC, c.640-16A &gt; G, c.1000-22C &gt; T) within the GLA gene associated with Fabry-like symptoms and galactosphingolipid accumulation. We analysed α-Gal A activity in plasma, leukocytes and skin fibroblasts in patients, and measured accumulation of galactosphingolipids by enzymatic methods and immunofluorescence techniques. Additionally, we evaluated GLA expression using quantitative PCR, EMSA, and cDNA clonin.
ers had an altered GLA expression pattern, although most of the carriers had high residual enzyme activity in plasma, leukocytes and in skin fibroblasts. Nonetheless, CIH carriers had significant galactosphingolipid accumulation in fibroblasts in comparison with controls, and also glycolipid deposits in renal tubules and glomeruli. EMSA assays indicated that the c.-10C &gt; T variant in the promoter affected a nuclear protein binding sit.
eritance of the CIH caused an mRNA deregulation altering the GLA expression pattern, producing a tissue glycolipid storag.
ease is an X-linked metabolic storage disorder due to the deficiency of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A which causes accumulation of glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide, throughout the body. Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms&nbsp;-&nbsp;abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and diverticular disease&nbsp;-&nbsp;are some of the most frequently reported complaints in patients with Fabry disease but are often neglected. Gastrointestinal symptoms are due to intestinal dysmotility as well as impaired autonomic function, vasculopathy and myopathy. Since 2001, enzyme replacement therapy has been a mainstay in treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms of Fabry disease (FD), resulting in reduced gastrointestinal symptoms. Here, we report on four patients with Fabry disease (FD) who manifested early gastrointestinal involvemen.
ter globiformis T6 isomaltodextranse (AgIMD) is an enzyme that liberates isomaltose from the non-reducing end of a polymer of glucose, dextran. AgIMD is classified as a member of glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 27, which comprises mainly α-galactosidases and α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases, whereas AgIMD does not show α-galactosidase or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities. Here we determined the crystal structure of AgIMD. AgIMD consists of three domains: A, C, and D. Domains A and C are identified as a (β/α)8-barrel catalytic domain and an antiparallel β-structure, respectively, both of which are commonly found in GH27 enzymes. However, domain A of AgIMD has subdomain B, loop-1, and loop-2, all of which are not found in GH27 human α-galactosidase. AgIMD in a complex with trisaccharide panose shows that Asp207, a residue in loop-1, is involved in subsite +1. Kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant enzymes for a small synthetic saccharide, p-nitrophenyl α-isomaltoside, and the polysaccharide, dextran, were compared, showing that Asp207 is important for the catalysis of dextran. Domain D is classified as carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 35, and an isomaltose molecule is seen in this domain in the AgIMD-isomaltose complex. Domain D is highly homologous to CBM35 domains found in GH31 and GH66 enzymes. The results here indicate that some features found in GH13, 31, and 66 enzymes, such as subdomain B, residues at subsite +1, and the CBM35 domain, are also observed in the GH27 enzyme, AgIMD, and thus provide insights into the evolutionary relationships among GH13, 27, 31, 36, and 66 enzyme.
ease is an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by a deficiency in lysosomal glycohydrolase α-galactosidase A. This defect results in the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in various organ systems. Lipid deposits occur preferentially in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to vascular dysfunction, which results in tissue ischemia and vessel occlusion. Clinical symptoms are divided into two categories: early symptoms and late complications. Early symptoms include acroparesthesia, bouts of pain in the hands or feet, hypohidrosis, angiokeratoma, and gastrointestinal complications, which begin in the early childhood of patients with Fabry disease. Late complications include renal and cardiac dysfunction, and cerebral infarction, which determine morbidity and mortality after age 30 years. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant human α-galactosidase A has recently developed, and has been shown to improve prognosis of patients with Fabry disease. Recent reports investigating long-term outcomes with ERT have shown that early initiation before the development of irreversible organ failure is particularly effective. Diagnosis at the early stage of the disorder and the early initiation of ERT alleviate symptoms and prevent late complications. The disorder should be widely recognized to improve patients' outcom.
igate the role of herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) in viral entry and inflammatory cytokine production in response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 challenge in human corneal epithelial cell.
ession in human corneal epithelial cells was determined by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The HSV-1 virus expressing β-galactosidase was used to challenge corneal epithelial cells and viral entry assays were performed to ascertain HSV-1 entry into cells. Levels of cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-x03B3;, IL-12, and IL-18 and chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MIP-2 were detected in corneal epithelial cells treated with control or HVEM siRNA in response to HSV-1 challeng.
neal epithelial cells were positive for HVEM expression and showed high susceptibility to HSV-1 entry. Silencing of HVEM did not alter viral entry dramatically. However, levels of the cytokine IFN-x03B3; and chemokines MIP-1α and MIP-1β were measured to be higher in HVEM siRNA-treated cells than control after HSV-1 challeng.
uman corneal epithelial cells may act to dampen the production of some cytokines and chemokines and thus it may modulate the innate immune response against HSV-1. This may provide a novel mechanism for the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection in the corne.
virus B3 (CVB3) infection causes central nervous system diseases including aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. To understand the mechanism of this virus, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen cellular proteins from a human heart cDNA library. The results revealed that the human Pleckstrin Homology Domain Retinal protein (PHR1), a PH domain-containing protein with low expression in the heart and high expression in the brain, interacts with CVB3 VP1, a major structural protein of CVB3. Yeast mating assays and in vitro coimmunoprecipitation verified the interaction between CVB3 VP1 and PHR1. An α-galactosidase assay indicated that of α-galactosidase activity was higher in positive clones than in controls suggesting a strong interaction. Furthermore, assay of deletion mutants defined the minimal region of PHR1 required for its interaction with VP1 as amino acids 95-172 and two regions of VP1 required for its interaction with PHR1 as amino acids 729-767 and 811-859. The results revealed multiple binding sites between PHR1 and CVB3 VP1 and suggested that the strong interaction between these two proteins might play an important role in central nervous system disease in the human brai.
thanol elution fractions of root-bark of Sambucus Williamsii Hance (rbSWH) evaluated the effect of proliferation and differentiation on preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cell, and the mechanism of actions. We found that rbSWH(30, 60, and 90 µg/mL) can enhance cell proliferation by MTT assay and promote alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone Gla protein (BGP) activities, type I collagen (Col-I) synthesis, and mineralization nodule formation in primary cultured osteoblasts. The results showed that rbSWH can increase mRNA levels of BMP-2 and Runx2 using real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, whereas the BMP-2 antagonist Noggin attenuated the increase of ALP activity induced by rbSWH, indicating that BMP-2 expression was required for the action of rbSWH in osteoblastic. We also found that rbSWH can enhance the expressions of BMP-2, BMPRIB, BMPRII, phosphorylation of Smad, JNK and p38, and Runx2 proteins by western blotting. In addition, pretreatment of cells with p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or JNK inhibitor (SP600125) can antagonize the elevation of BMP-2 expression, ALP activity, and cell viability induced by rbSWH. Taken together, our results provided an evidence that rbSWH can promote MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and differentiation via BMP-2/Smad/p38/JNK/Runx2 signaling pathway.

f TLR agonists as an anti-cancer treatment is gaining momentum given their capacity to activate various host cellular responses through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons. It is now also recognized that the perioperative period is a window of opportunity for various interventions aiming at reducing the risk of cancer metastases - the major cause of cancer related death. However, immune-stimulatory approach has not been used perioperatively given several contraindications to surgery. To overcome these obstacles, in the current study we employed the newly introduced, fully synthetic TLR-4 agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid-A (GLA-SE), in various models of cancer metastases, and in the context of acute stress or surgery. Without exerting evident adverse effects, a single systemic administration of GLA-SE rapidly and dose dependently elevated both innate and adaptive immunity in the circulation, lungs, and the lymphatic system. Importantly, GLA-SE treatment led to reduced metastatic development of a mammary adenocarcinoma and a colon carcinoma by approximately 40-75% in F344 rats and BALB/c mice, respectively, at least partly through elevating marginating-pulmonary NK cell cytotoxicity. GLA-SE is safe and well tolerated in humans, and currently is used as an adjuvant in phase-II clinical trials. Given that the TLR-4 receptor and its signaling cascade is highly conserved throughout evolution, our current results suggest that GLA-SE may be a promising immune stimulatory agent in the context of oncological surgeries, aiming to reduce long-term cancer recurrence.

tation of the oral mucosa has a multitude of aetiological causes. Retigabine, a new antiepileptic drug, has the potential side effect of inducing a blue/purple pigmentation of the oral mucosa in addition to the skin, lips, nails and retina of the eyes. This article presents a unique case of dyspigmentation present in the oral mucosa of the hard palate which has previously been unreported in the dental literatur.
;year old white male presented to a secondary care oral surgery department with an unusual asymptomatic pigmented lesion present in the hard palate of the oral cavity. The pigmentation was remarkable for its distinct blue/purple colouration which was associated with a similar discolouration of the nail beds of the hands. This is believed to be a side effect of the anti-epileptic medication retigabin.
l profession and wider healthcare community should be made fully aware of the potential side effect of oral dyspigmentation associated with the novel anti-epileptic medication retigabine. Enhanced knowledge of the causative role of retigabine in dyspigementation of the oral mucosa will allow the practitioner to make an appropriate diagnosis. As far the authors are aware this is reaction is unreported in the dental literature and should be disseminated to the wider oral health professional's communit.
illomavirus type 16 (HPV16) causes a range of cancers including cervical and head and neck cancers. HPV E6 oncoprotein binds the cell polarity regulator hDlg (human homologue of Drosophila Discs Large). Previously we showed in vitro, and now in vivo, that hDlg also binds Connexin 43 (Cx43), a major component of gap junctions that mediate intercellular transfer of small molecules. In HPV16-positive non-tumour cervical epithelial cells (W12G) Cx43 localised to the plasma membrane, while in W12T tumour cells derived from these, it relocated with hDlg into the cytoplasm. We now provide evidence that E6 regulates this cytoplasmic pool of Cx43. E6 siRNA depletion in W12T cells resulted in restoration of Cx43 and hDlg trafficking to the cell membrane. In C33a HPV-negative cervical tumour cells expressing HPV16 or 18 E6, Cx43 was located primarily in the cytoplasm, but mutation of the 18E6 C-terminal hDlg binding motif resulted in redistribution of Cx43 to the membrane. The data indicate for the first time that increased cytoplasmic E6 levels associated with malignant progression alter Cx43 trafficking and recycling to the membrane and the E6/hDlg interaction may be involved. This suggests a novel E6-associated mechanism for changes in Cx43 trafficking in cervical tumour cell.
c ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common form of pancreatic tumour, with a very limited survival rate and currently no available disease-modifying treatments. Despite recent advances in the production of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), the development of new therapies for pancreatic cancer is still hampered by a lack of reliable and predictive preclinical animal models for this disease. Preclinical models are vitally important for assessing therapies in the first stages of the drug development pipeline, prior to their transition to the clinical arena. GEMMs carry mutations in genes that are associated with specific human diseases and they can thus accurately mimic the genetic, phenotypic and physiological aspects of human pathologies. Here, we discuss different GEMMs of human pancreatic cancer, with a focus on the Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL)-Kras(G12D); LSL-Trp53(R172H); Pdx1-cre (KPC) model, one of the most widely used preclinical models for this disease. We describe its application in preclinical research, highlighting its advantages and disadvantages, its potential for predicting clinical outcomes in humans and the factors that can affect such outcomes, and, finally, future developments that could advance the discovery of new therapies for pancreatic cance.
2013, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A H7N9 virus. Infection with this virus often caused severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting in a case fatality rate &gt;35%. The risk of pandemic highlighted, once again, the need for a more rapid and scalable vaccine response capability. Here, we describe the rapid (19 days) development of a plant-derived VLP vaccine based on the hemagglutinin sequence of influenza H7N9 A/Hangzhou/1/2013. The immunogenicity of the H7 VLP vaccine was assessed in mice and ferrets after one or two intramuscular dose(s) with and without adjuvant (alum or GLA-SE™). In ferrets, we also measured H7-specific cell-mediated immunity. The mice and ferrets were then challenged with H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 influenza virus. A single immunization with the adjuvanted vaccine elicited a strong humoral response and protected mice against an otherwise lethal challenge. Two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine significantly increased humoral response and resulted in 100% protection with significant reduction of clinical signs leading to nearly asymptomatic infections. In ferrets, a single immunization with the alum-adjuvanted H7 VLP vaccine induced strong humoral and CMI responses with antigen-specific activation of CD3(+) T cells. Compared to animals injected with placebo, ferrets vaccinated with alum-adjuvanted vaccine displayed no weight loss during the challenge. Moreover, the vaccination significantly reduced the viral load in lungs and nasal washes 3 days after the infection. This candidate plant-made H7 vaccine therefore induced protective responses after either one adjuvanted or two unadjuvanted doses. Studies are currently ongoing to better characterize the immune response elicited by the plant-derived VLP vaccines. Regardless, these data are very promising for the rapid production of an immunogenic and protective vaccine against this potentially pandemic viru.
um expansum, causal agent of blue mold rot, causes severe postharvest fruit maceration simultaneously with secretion of D-gluconic acid (GLA) and the mycotoxin patulin in colonized tissue. The factor(s) inducing patulin biosynthesis during colonization of the host acidic environment is unclear. During colonization of apple fruit in vivo and growth in culture, P. expansum secretes pH-modulating GLA and ammonia. While patulin and its possible opportunistic precursor GLA accumulate together during fungal development, ammonia is detected on the colonized tissue's leading edge and after extended culture, close to patulin accumulation. Here we demonstrate ammonia-induced transcript activation of the global pH modulator PacC and patulin accumulation in the presence of GLA by: i. direct exogenous treatment of P. expansum growing on solid media, ii. colonizing apple tissue, iii. growth under self-ammonia-production conditions with limited carbon, and iv. analysis of the patulin-biosynthesis cluster's transcriptional response to ammonia. Ammonia induced patulin accumulation concurrently with transcript activation of pacC, and patulin-biosynthesis cluster genes, indicating ammonia's regulatory effect on pacC transcript expression under acid conditions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using P. expansum PacC and antibodies to the different cleaved proteins showed that PacC is not protected against proteolytic signaling at pH 4.5 compared to pH 7.0, but NH4 addition did not further enhance its proteolytic cleavage. Ammonia did enhance activation of palF transcript in the PaL pathway under acidic conditions. Ammonia accumulation in the host environment by the pathogen under acid pH may be a regulatory cue for pacC activation, toward accumulation of secondary metabolites such as patuli.
nt study evaluated the relationship between dietary fatty acid (FA) intakes and human milk FA level.
actating women (n = 514) from Northern China participated in the study. Dietary intake was assessed with a 24-h dietary recall questionnaire and evaluated using golden key maternal nutrition software (Wincome, Shanghai, China) and China Food Composition 2009. Human milk FA composition was determined by gas chromatograph.
nal daily median intakes of linoleic acid (LA), α-linolenic acid (ALA) and arachidonic acid (AA) were 19.93 g, 3.08 g and 16.33 mg, respectively. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intakes were below the recommended levels. FA levels in 100 g of human milk were 0.363 g LA, 0.038 g γ-linolenic acid (GLA), 0.052 g dihomo γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), 0.144 g ALA, 0.079 g AA, 0.007 g EPA, 0.018 g docosatetraenoic acid (DTA) and 0.048 g DHA. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that human milk DGLA levels were negatively correlated with dietary LA intake (β = -0.223, P = 0.030), and human milk GLA and DTA levels were negatively correlated with dietary ALA intake (β = -2.189, P = 0.031; β = -2.252, P = 0.027) after adjusting for possible confounding factor.
ts of the present study suggest the presence of competitive interactions between n-3 fatty acids (ALA) and n-6 fatty acids (GLA and DTA.
in nanocages are designed bearing two functional proteins, γ-carboxyglutamic acid of protein C (PC-Gla) and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP), and have the anti-septic response. These nanoparticles reduce sepsis-induced organ injury and septic mortality in vivo. Noting that there are currently no medications for severe sepsis, these results show that novel nanoparticles can be used to treat sepsi.
empirical evidence is scanty on the social implications of genetically modified (GM) crops in Africa, especially on vegetatively propagated crops. Little is known about the future success of introducing GM technologies into staple crops such as bananas, which are widely produced and consumed in the Great Lakes Region of Africa (GLA). GM banana has a potential to control the destructive banana Xanthomonas wilt diseas.
 better understanding of future adoption and consumption of GM banana in the GLA countries which are yet to permit the production of GM crops; specifically, to evaluate the potential economic impacts of GM cultivars resistant to banana Xanthomonas wilt diseas.
 uses data collected from farmers, traders, agricultural extension agents and key informants in the GL.
e the perceptions of the respondents about the adoption and consumption of GM crop. Economic surplus model is used to determine future economic benefits and costs of producing GM banan.
lease of GM banana for commercialization, the expected initial adoption rate ranges from 21 to 70%, while the ceiling adoption rate is up to 100%. Investment in the development of GM banana is economically viable. However, aggregate benefits vary substantially across the target countries ranging from US$ 20 million to 953 million, highest in countries where disease incidence and production losses are high, ranging from 51 to 83% of productio.
ngs support investment in the development of GM banana resistant to Xanthomonas wilt disease. The main beneficiaries of this technology development are farmers and consumers, although the latter benefit more than the former from reduced prices. Designing a participatory breeding program involving farmers and consumers signifies the successful adoption and consumption of GM banana in the target countrie.
are development process is a complex process, especially when the software has to be released in a phased manner. The high stakes involved and several constraints on resources lead to the selective implementation of the user requirements at each stage of the development. If the requirements considered, do not fit well, they have to be reprioritized. The objectives of this paper are to create a background related to the area of reprioritization and to create a distinguishable position from the prioritization area. The paper elaborates on the current state of reprioritization practices adopted in the software industry. The gaps in research in the area of reprioritization to present future opportunities for the research community are also analysed. This paper builds on the findings of a systematic literature survey (to analyze state of the art in the area of reprioritization), previous case studies (to gain understanding of real scenarios through limited available information), and more detailed real case study (focussed on reprioritization alone) conducted by fewer multinational software development organizations. Based on our studies it is concluded that the efficient reprioritization methods are required to be adopted in software engineering practices of the organisation in order to sustain in the highly competitive mass marke.
d lipids (SLs) containing palmitic, docosahexaenoic (DHA), and gamma-linolenic (GLA) acids were produced using refined olive oil, tripalmitin, and ethyl esters of DHA single cell oil and GLA ethyl esters. Immobilized Lipozyme TL IM lipase was used as the biocatalyst. The SLs were characterized for fatty acid profile, triacylglycerol (TAG) molecular species, solid fat content, oxidative stability index, and melting and crystallization profiles and compared to physical blend of substrates, extracted fat from commercial infant formula (IFF), and milk fat. 49.28 mol% of palmitic acid was found at the sn-2 position of SL TAG and total DHA and GLA composition were 0.73 and 5.00 mol%, respectively. The total oleic acid content was 36.13 mol% which was very close to the 30.49% present in commercial IFF. Comparable solid fat content profiles were also found between SLs and IFF. The SLs produced have potential for use in infant formula.
f the functional consequences of DCM-causing mutations have been limited to a few cases where patients with known mutations had heart transplants. To increase the number of potential tissue samples for direct investigation we performed whole exon sequencing of explanted heart muscle samples from 30 patients that had a diagnosis of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and screened for potentially disease-causing mutations in 58 HCM or DCM-related gene.
fied 5 potentially disease-causing OBSCN mutations in 4 samples; one sample had two OBSCN mutations and one mutation was judged to be not disease-related. Also identified were 6 truncating mutations in TTN, 3 mutations in MYH7, 2 in DSP and one each in TNNC1, TNNI3, MYOM1, VCL, GLA, PLB, TCAP, PKP2 and LAMA4. The mean level of obscurin mRNA was significantly greater and more variable in healthy donor samples than the DCM samples but did not correlate with OBSCN mutations. A single obscurin protein band was observed in human heart myofibrils with apparent mass 960 ± 60 kDa. The three samples with OBSCN mutations had significantly lower levels of obscurin immunoreactive material than DCM samples without OBSCN mutations (45±7, 48±3, and 72±6% of control level).Obscurin levels in DCM controls, donor heart and myectomy samples were the sam.
ations may result in the development of a DCM phenotype via haploinsufficiency. Mutations in the obscurin gene should be considered as a significant causal factor of DCM, alone or in concert with other mutation.
se of this study was to develop a new formulation to enhance the bioavailability simultaneously with controlled release of glaucocalyxin A (GLA.
tudy, controlled release of GLA was achieved by the osmotic release strategy taking advantage of the bioavailability enhancing capacity of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). The formulation of GLA-SNEDDS was selected by the solubility and pseudoternary-phase diagrams studies. The prepared GLA-SNEDDS formulations were characterized for self-emulsification time, effect of pH and robustness to dilution, droplet size analysis and zeta potential. The optimized GLA-SNEDDS were used to prepare GLA-SNEDDS osmotic pump tablet via direct powder compression method. The effect of formulation variables on the release characteristic was investigated. GLA-SNEDDS osmotic pump tablets were administered to beagle dogs and their pharmacokinetics were compared to GLA and GLA-SNEDDS as a contro.
drug release studies indicated that the GLA-SNEDDS osmotic pump tablet showed sustained release profiles with 90% released within 12 h. Pharmacokinetic study showed steady blood GLA with prolonged Tmax and mean residence time (MRT), and enhanced bioavailability for GLA-SNEDDS osmotic pump table.
ncluded that simultaneous controlling on GLA release and enhanced bioavailability had been achieved by a combination of osmotic pump tablet and SNEDD.
igated the proliferation and differentiation potential of human osteoblasts from a type 2 diabetic patient in vitro. Human osteoblasts were obtained from a healthy subject and a type 2 diabetic patient and were cultured in vitro using the tissue explant adherent method. Differences in cell morphology were observed under a phase contrast microscope. The osteogenic differentiation capacity was evaluated by alizarin red staining, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and detection of bone Gla-protein (BGP) and Col-1. Expression of Runx-2 and Col-1 was detected using RT-PCR and western blot. Our data indicated that alveolar bone osteoblasts from the type 2 diabetic patient exhibited poorer growth, smaller calcium nodule formation, slower proliferation, and lower ALP, BGP, and Col-1 concentrations in the cell culture supernatant, as compared to control cells (P &lt; 0.05). Combined, our study indicated that alveolar bone osteoblasts from a type 2 diabetic patient exhibited slower proliferation and decreased differentiation, as compared to healthy control, when cultured in vitr.
e marker protein 30 (SMP30) is assumed to behave as an anti-aging factor. Recently, we have demonstrated that deficiency of SMP30 exacerbates angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction and remodeling, suggesting that SMP30 may have a protective role in the heart. Thus, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that up-regulation of SMP30 inhibits cardiac adverse remodeling in response to angiotensin I.
ted transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of SMP30 gene using α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Transgenic mice and wild-type littermate mice were subjected to continuous angiotensin II infusion (800 ng/kg/min.
days, heart weight and left ventricular weight were lower in transgenic mice than in wild-type mice, although blood pressure was similarly elevated during angiotensin II infusion. Cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in response to angiotensin II were prevented in transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. The degree of cardiac fibrosis by angiotensin II was lower in transgenic mice than in wild-type mice. Angiotensin II-induced generation of superoxide and subsequent cellular senescence were attenuated in transgenic mouse hearts compared with wild-type mic.
pecific overexpression of SMP30 inhibited angiotensin II-induced cardiac adverse remodeling. SMP30 has a cardio-protective role with anti-oxidative and anti-aging effects and could be a novel therapeutic target to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling due to hypertensio.
ble α-galactosidase from Aspergillus terreus (GR) was insolubilized using concanavalin A obtained from jack bean extract and in order to maintain the integrity of complex in the presence of its substrate or products, this complex was crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. Soluble α-galactosidase entrapped in calcium alginate retained 82% of enzyme activity whereas, Con A-α-galactosidase complex entrapped in calcium alginate and crosslinked Con A-α-galactosidase complex entrapped calcium alginate retained 74 and 61% activity, respectively. A fluidized bed reactor was constructed for continuous hydrolysis of galactooligosaccharides in soymilk using crosslinked Con A-α-galactosidase complex entrapped calcium alginate. Optimum conditions such as pH (5.0) and temperature (65°C) were the same for all immobilized enzyme preparations and soluble enzyme. Crosslinked Con A-α-galactosidase entrapped complex exhibited enhanced thermostability and showed 62% of activity (38%) after 360 min at 65°C. Entrapped crosslinked Con A-α-galactosidase complex preparation was superior in the continuous hydrolysis of oligosaccharides in soymilk by batch processes compared to the other entrapped preparations. The entrapped crosslinked concanavalin A-α-galactosidase complex retained 95% activity after eight cycles of us.
uclein is central in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Although initially alpha-synuclein was considered a purely intracellular protein, recent data suggest that it can be detected in the plasma and CSF of humans and in the culture media of neuronal cells. To address a role of secreted alpha-synuclein in neuronal homeostasis, we have generated wild-type alpha-synuclein and beta-galactosidase inducible SH-SY5Y cells. Soluble oligomeric and monomeric species of alpha-synuclein are readily detected in the conditioned media (CM) of these cells at concentrations similar to those observed in human CSF. We have found that, in this model, alpha-synuclein is secreted by externalized vesicles in a calcium-dependent manner. Electron microscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomic analysis demonstrate that these vesicles have the characteristic hallmarks of exosomes, secreted intraluminar vesicles of multivesicular bodies. Application of CM containing secreted alpha-synuclein causes cell death of recipient neuronal cells, which can be reversed after alpha-synuclein immunodepletion from the CM. High- and low-molecular-weight alpha-synuclein species, isolated from this CM, significantly decrease cell viability. Importantly, treatment of the CM with oligomer-interfering compounds before application rescues the recipient neuronal cells from the observed toxicity. Our results show for the first time that cell-produced alpha-synuclein is secreted via an exosomal, calcium-dependent mechanism and suggest that alpha-synuclein secretion serves to amplify and propagate Parkinson's disease-related patholog.
 cleavage of the glycosidic bond yields products in which the anomeric configuration is either retained or inverted. Each mechanism reflects the dispositions of the enzyme functional groups; a facet of which is essentially conserved in 113 glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. We show that family GH97 has diverged significantly, as it contains both inverting and retaining alpha-glycosidases. This reflects evolution of the active center; a glutamate acts as a general base in inverting members, exemplified by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron alpha-glucosidase BtGH97a, whereas an aspartate likely acts as a nucleophile in retaining members. The structure of BtGH97a and its complexes with inhibitors, coupled to kinetic analysis of active-site variants, reveals an unusual calcium ion dependence. 1H NMR analysis shows an inversion mechanism for BtGH97a, whereas another GH97 enzyme from B. thetaiotaomicron, BtGH97b, functions as a retaining alpha-galactosidas.
tions concerning recombinant a-amylases from Pyrococcus woesei and thermostable a-glucosidase from Thermus thermophilus indicate their suitability for starch processing. Furthermore, the study of recombinant ss-galactosidase from Pyrococcus woesei suitable for purpose of low lactose milk and whey production are also presented. The activity of this enzyme in a wide pH range of 4.3-6.6 and high thermostability suggests that it can be used for processing of dairy products at temperatures which restrict microbial growth during a long operating time of continuous-flow reactor with an immobilized enzyme system. Preparation of recombinant a-amylase and ss-galactosidase was facilitated by cloning and expression of genes from Pyrococcus woesei in Escherichia coli host. Satisfactory level of recombinant enzymes purification was achieved by thermal precipitation of native proteins originated from Escherichia coli. The obtained a-amylase has maximal activity at pH 5.6 and 93 degrees C. The half-life of this preparation (pH 5.6) at 90 degrees C and 110 degrees C was 11 h and 3.5 h, respectively, and retained 24% of residual activity following incubation for 2 h at 120 degrees C. An advantageous attribute of recombinant a -amylase is independence of its activity and stability on calcium salt. a-Glucosidase from Thermus thermophilus also not require metal ions for stability and retained about 80% of maximal activity at pH range 5.8-6.9. Thus, this enzyme can be used together with recombinant a-amylas.
storis has emerged as a commercially important yeast for the production of a vast majority of recombinant therapeutic proteins and vaccines. The organism can be grown to very high cell densities using a defined basal salts media (BSM). However, BSM contains bi-cation or tri-cation phosphate, which precipitates out of the medium at pH above 5.5, although the optimal fermentation pH of most recombinant protein fermentation varies between 5.5 and 7.0. In this article, the application of glycerophosphates was investigated as a substitute phosphate source in an effort to eliminate precipitation. The solubility of BSM containing sodium or potassium glycerophosphates was examined before and after autoclaving at various pHs. Sodium glycerophosphate was found stable at autoclave temperature but formed complexes with coexisting magnesium and calcium ions that were insoluble above pH 7.0. Medium where sodium glycerophosphate was autoclaved separately and then added to the growth medium did not produce any precipitate up to pH 10.5. The performance of P. pastoris fermentations expressing alpha-galactosidase and ovine interferon-tau using a glycerolphosphate-based medium was found to be comparable to a conventional BSM. The results from this work demonstrate that sodium glycerophosphate can be assimilated by the P. pastoris strains and can be employed as a reliable phosphorus source for both cell growth and recombinant protein productio.
utrients belonging to three categories, carbon, organic nitrogen and complex organic sources, were investigated for the first time in terms of their effect on the co-production of extracellular thermostable alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase by Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium isolated from fresh sheep's milk. Among the organic nitrogen sources tested, tryptone and corn steep liquor favored their production. Substitution of soluble starch by various starchy substrates, such as corn flour, had a positive effect on both enzyme yields. Furthermore, a two-fold higher production of both enzymes was achieved when corn steep liquor or tryptone was used in combination with the different flours. Among the divalent cations examined, calcium ions appeared to be vital for alpha-amylase production. The crude alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase produced by this B. subtilis strain exhibited maximal activities at 135 degrees C and 65 degrees C, respectively, and were also found to be significantly stable at elevated temperature.
ellar transport (IFT) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism thought to be required for the assembly and maintenance of all eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Although IFT proteins are present in cells with sensory cilia, the organization of IFT protein complexes in those cells has not been analyzed. To determine whether the IFT complex is conserved in the sensory cilia of photo-receptors, we investigated protein interactions among four mammalian IFT proteins: IFT88/Polaris, IFT57/Hippi, IFT52/NGD5, and IFT20. We demonstrate that IFT proteins extracted from bovine photoreceptor outer segments, a modified sensory cilium, co-fractionate at approximately 17 S, similar to IFT proteins extracted from mouse testis. Using antibodies to IFT88 and IFT57, we demonstrate that all four IFT proteins co-immunoprecipitate from lysates of mouse testis, kidney, and retina. We also extended our analysis to interactions outside of the IFT complex and demonstrate an ATP-regulated co-immunoprecipitation of heterotrimeric kinesin II with the IFT complex. The internal architecture of the IFT complex was investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system. IFT20 exhibited a strong interaction with IFT57/Hippi and the kinesin II subunit, KIF3B. Our data indicate that all four mammalian IFT proteins are part of a highly conserved complex in multiple ciliated cell types. Furthermore, IFT20 appears to bridge kinesin II with the IFT comple.
hydrolytic enzymes from suspension-cultured carrot (Daucus carota L. cv. Kintoki) cells grown in calcium (Ca2+)-deficient and normal liquid media were studied after extraction successively by K-phosphate (pH 7.0) and Na-acetate (pH 5.2) containing 3 M LiCl. The same activities were detected in two protein fractions from control and Ca2+-deprived cells. The specific activities of alpha-galactosidase and polygalacturonase decreased under Ca2+ deprivation, but beta-galactosidase activity in the buffer-soluble protein from Ca2+-deprived cells increased 1.7-fold compared to control cells. Upon ion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography the fraction (Ca-Ia-I) in the buffer-soluble protein from Ca2+-deprived cells represented beta-galactosidase activity associated with a galacturonic acid-rich polysaccharide peak, whereas the corresponding fraction could hardly be detected in the buffer-soluble protein from control cells. Several of the same glycosidase activities were detected in the extract solubilized with cyclohexane-trans-1,2-diaminetetra-acetate (CDTA) from active cell walls of Ca2+-deprived cells as in the extract of control cells, but the beta-galactosidase activity was considerably reduced under Ca2+ deprivation. Following the same chromatography the fraction (CDTA-Ca-1) of beta-galactosidase activity in the extract solubilized with CDTA from active cell walls of Ca2+-deprived cells was also completely overlapping with the peak of galacturonic acid-rich polysaccharide. The molecular mass of fractions Ca-Ia-I and CDTA-Ca-1 was 300 kDa, and the polysaccharides in these two fractions were composed of approximately equal amounts of rhamnosyl and galacturonosyl residues. These results suggest that the increase of beta-galactosidase in the buffer-soluble protein fraction from Ca2+-deprived cells is the result of solubilization of a part of the acidic pectic polymer-bound beta-galactosidase due to the structural changes in the cell walls that occur during Ca2+ deprivatio.
ient transport of proteins along the secretory pathway requires that the polypeptide adopts a stably folded conformation to egress the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The transport-competent precursor of the brush border enzyme LPH, pro-LPH, undergoes an intracellular cleavage process in the trans-Golgi network between Arg(734) and Leu(735) to yield LPH beta(initial). The role of the prodomain comprising the N-terminally located 734 amino acids of pro-LPH, LPH alpha, in the folding events of LPH beta(initial) has been analyzed by the individual expression of both forms in COS-1 cells. Following synthesis at 37 degrees C LPH beta(initial) acquires a misfolded and enzymatically inactive conformation that is degraded by trypsin. A temperature shift to 20 degrees C generates a stable, trypsin-resistant, and enzymatically active LPH beta(initial) indicating that the individual expression of LPH beta(initial) results in a temperature-sensitive conformation. This form interacts at non-permissive temperatures sequentially with the ER chaperones immunoglobulin-binding protein and calnexin resulting in an ER retention. The LPH alpha prodomain resides in the ER when individually expressed. It reveals compact structural features that are stabilized by disulfide bridges. LPH alpha and LPH beta(initial) readily interact with each other upon coexpression, and this interaction appears to trigger the formation of a trypsin-resistant, correctly folded, enzymatically active, and transport-competent LPH beta(initial) polypeptide. These data clearly demonstrate that the proregion of pro-LPH is an intramolecular chaperone that is critically essential in facilitating the folding of the intermediate form LPH beta(initial) in the context of the pro-LPH polypeptid.
lic bacteria were isolated from soil and water samples obtained from Ethiopian soda lakes in the Rift Valley area--Lake Shala, Lake Abijata, and Lake Arenguadi. Starch-hydrolyzing isolates were selected on the basis of their activity on starch agar plate assay. Sixteen isolates were chosen, characterized, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. All the isolates were gram positive and catalase- and beta-galactosidase positive. All isolates except one were motile endospore-forming rods and were found to be closely related to the Bacillus cluster, being grouped with Bacillus pseudofirmus, Bacillus cohnii, Bacillus vedderi, and Bacillus agaradhaerens. The one exception had nonmotile coccoid cells and was closely related to Nesterenkonia halobia. The majority of the isolates showed optimal growth at 37 degrees C and tolerated salinity up to 10% (w/v) NaCl. Both extracellular and cell-bound amylase activity was detected among the isolates. The amylase activity of two isolates, related to B. vedderi and B. cohnii, was stimulated by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and inhibited in the presence of calcium ions. Pullulanase activity was expressed by isolates grouped with B. vedderi and also most of the isolates clustered with B. cohnii; cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase was expressed by most of the B. agaradhaerens-related strains. Minor levels of alpha-glucosidase activity were detected in all the strain.
nosidase and beta-galactosidase were released from boar sperm into the medium by treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 or by 0.2% Brij-35/2% acetic acid. About half as much alpha-mannosidase activity as that in the acid extract was recovered by digestion with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), whereas the liberation rate of beta-galactosidase treated with PI-PLC was low. These results suggest that some alpha-mannosidase is anchored in the plasma membrane of the acrosomal region by attachment to the lipid phosphatidylinositol and that beta-galactosidase is localized mainly in the acrosome or integrated in the plasma membrane by a spanning stretch of hydrophobic peptides. beta-Galactosidase, which is present as an oligomers in the acid extract of sperm, dissociated into monomers under weakly alkaline conditions; under acidic conditions, the monomers associated again. No pH-sensitive association-dissociation of alpha-mannosidase was observe.
c myocytes, the effect of alpha1-adrenergic stimulation on L-type Ca current remains to be clarified. We examined this issue by the transient coexpression of alpha1-adrenoceptors on BHKC12 cells, where recombinant Ca channels composed of cardiac alpha1 subunit and skeletal beta, gamma, alpha2/delta subunits were stably expressed. After transfection of plasmid DNA encoding bovine alpha1C-adrenoceptors, bath-applied phenylephrine potentiated the cloned Ca channel current during perforated-patch whole-cell recording by 26+/-6% in 6 out of 12 cells. The potentiation was elicited also by methoxamine, and was blocked by prazosin. Phenylephrine also increased the channel open probability during cell-attached single channel recording in 7 out of 15 cells. The ratio of successful modulation of Ca channels was in accordance with the ratio of successful expression of alpha1-adrenoceptors, as estimated by beta-galactosidase staining. These results suggest that the stimulation of alpha1C-adrenoceptors is linked to potentiation of cardiac L-type Ca current. BHK cells provide a valuable expression system to study the modulation of Ca channels evoked by a receptor stimulatio.
 been renewed interest in radial artery (RA) conduits for coronary artery bypass because of the relative resistance of arterial grafts to atherosclerosis compared with autogenous vein grafts. Although improved drug therapy for arterial spasm is now available, vasospasm still occurs in at least 5% to 10% of RA grafts. We systematically evaluated the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates for inhibition or reversal of RA contraction in vitro. Additionally, we investigated the efficacy of novel gene therapy with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to inhibit RA contraction.
of RA from 28 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were mounted in organ chambers. In control experiments, KCl (5 to 50 mmol/L) produced dose-dependent increases in tension (maximum tension, 14.3 +/- 3.0 g, n = 7). Addition of diltiazem or verapamil had no significant effect on KCl contraction (128 +/- 36% and 88 +/- 24% control, respectively); however, nifedipine markedly inhibited KCl contraction (27 +/- 4% control, P = 0.005). Norepinephrine (NE, 10(-9) to 10(-4) M) produced dose-dependent increases in tension (maximum tension, 15.7 +/- 2.7 g in control rings, n = 8). Diltiazem and verapamil pretreatment had no significant effect on NE contraction (103 +/- 14% and 90 +/- 14% control, respectively); nifedipine significantly inhibited NE contraction (70 +/- 11% control, P = 0.02). Isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin markedly inhibited KCl contractions (47 +/- 9% and 30 +/- 8% of controls, n = 6) and NE contractions (42 +/- 10% and 31 +/- 9% of controls, n = 6). Nifedipine, isosorbide, and nitroglycerin were further evaluated for the ability to reverse an established contraction (KCl 40 mmol/L); nitroglycerin was most effective in reversing RA contraction. In separate experiments, RA underwent adenoviral-mediated gene transfer with vehicle, Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, or eNOS (eNOS, 10(10) PFU/mL x 1 hour). Transgene expression was confirmed by beta-galactosidase activity and eNOS immunohistochemistry after 40 hours of ex vivo incubation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated recombinant NOS in adenovirus encoding bovine eNOS (Ad.CMVeNOS) RA only. Ad.CMVeNOS arteries contracted only 46.6 +/- 13.7% of controls to KCl (n = 5) and 48.2 +/- 11.4% of controls to prostaglandin F2 alpha a (10(-9) to 10(-6) M, n = 5.
, which is used empirically to prevent RA vasospasm, had little effect on human RA contractions (receptor-independent and receptor-dependent). Organic nitrates inhibited and reversed RA contractions. Adenoviral transfer of NOS suggests that future clinical application of gene therapy may play an important role in prevention of RA vasospas.
ne transfer of exogenous nitric oxide synthase, with the subsequent increase in nitric oxide production, could represent a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of vascular proliferative disorders. The goal of the present study was to determine if porcine coronary arteries could be transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Ad.CMVeNOS) resulting in functional expressio.
of porcine right coronary artery were exposed for 1 h at 37 degrees C to either replication-deficient adenovirus encoding bovine endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Ad.CMVeNOS, 5 x 10(9) pfu/ml) or control adenovirus encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (Ad.CMVLacZ, 5 x 10(9) pfu/ml). Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody specific for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) demonstrated recombinant gene expression in both the endothelial and adventitial layers of Ad.CMVeNOS transduced coronaries with only endogenous NOS confirmed in the endothelium of Ad.CMVLacZ arteries. Coronary arteries transduced with Ad.CMVeNOS yielded 517 +/- 110 (mean +/- S.E.M.) nM/ng nitrite while vessels transduced with Ad.CMVLacZ yielded 126 +/- 84 nM/ng (P &lt; 0.05, n = 6). Isometric tension recording, following prostaglandin F2 alpha constriction, documented a reduced tension in Ad.CMVeNOS transduced coronaries, compared to matched Ad.CMVLacZ coronaries (6.10 +/- 1.08 g vs. 8.45 +/- 1.19 g, respectively, P = 0.05, n = 8). This tension differential was eliminated with prior incubation in NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 10(-4) M). The EC50 for calcium ionophore relaxation of Ad.CMVeNOS coronary arteries was reduced compared to Ad.CMVLacZ (-7.90 +/- 0.03 logM vs. -7.26 +/- 0.11 logM, respectively, P &lt; 0.05, n = 8.
dies demonstrate successful transfer of endothelial nitric oxide synthase into porcine coronary arteries as verified by histochemical localization of recombinant protein with an increase of nitric oxide release as demonstrated by enhanced nitrite production and an alteration in vasomotor functio.
and a series of substituted derivatives have been tested as substrates, inhibitors and inactivators of the Agrobacterium faecalis beta-glucosidase in order to probe structure/function relationships in this enzyme. D-Glucal is shown to be a substrate (kcat = 2.3 min-1, Km = 0.85 mM) undergoing hydration with stereospecific protonation from the alpha-face to yield 2-deoxy-beta-D-glucose. 1-Methyl-D-glucal surprisingly serves as only a poor substrate (kcat = 0.056 min-1, Km = 57 mM), also undergoing protonation from the alpha-face. 2-Fluoro-D-glucal, however is completely inert, as a result of inductive destabilisation of the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state for protonation, and functions only as a relatively weak (Ki = 24 mM) inhibitor. Similar behaviour was seen with almond beta-glucosidase and yeast alpha-glucosidase and for the interaction of 2-fluoro-D-galactal with Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. A series of of alpha, beta-unsaturated glucal derivatives was also synthesised and tested as potential substrates, inhibitors or inactivators of A. faecalis beta-glucosidase. Of these only 1-nitro-D-glucal functioned as a time dependent, irreversible inactivator (ki = 0.011 min-1, Ki = 5.5 mM), presumably acting as a Michael acceptor. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis revealed multiple labeling of the enzyme by this inactivator, lessening its usefulness as an affinity label. Less reactive Michael acceptor glycals which might have been more specific (1-cyano-, 2-cyano-, 1-carboxylic acid, 1-carboxylic acid methyl ester) unfortunately did not function as inactivators or substrates, only as relatively weak reversible inhibitors (Ki = 3-96 mM.
to evaluate the characteristics and efficiency of gene transfer in primary cultures of oligodendrocytes, four different techniques including particle bombardment (Accell gene gun), cationic liposome-mediated transfection (lipofection), calcium phosphate co-precipitation and retroviral infection were compared using the LacZ and luciferase reporter genes. Highly purified postnatal adult rat oligodendrocytes were obtained by sequential immunopanning, plated in culture, and transfected using various reporter and promoter genes. The most efficient expression of LacZ and luciferase genes was found with particle mediated gene delivery. The transgene expression level obtained with gene gun delivery was at least two- to 100-fold greater than three other tested gene transfer methods. Comparison of the relative strength of four viral and two cellular promoters in these primary oligodendrocytes cultures demonstrated that the CMV promoter was the strongest. Using a human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene, a long-term transgene expression pattern in primary oligodendrocytes was demonstrated to be sustained in culture for the entire experimental period (4 weeks) after particle-mediated gene transfer. These results demonstrate that expression of a foreign gene can be effectively achieved in primary cultures of adult oligodendrocytes, especially by using the particle bombardment method. The results also suggest that the current ex vivo gene transfer system may be used to manipulate oligodendrocytes for future application in gene therapy studie.
otrimeric G protein, G alpha i2, transduces signals from seven membrane spanning receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. The purpose of this study was to identify these or other cellular proteins that interact with G alpha i2 by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. A human B cell cDNA library was screened by this system using full length G alpha i2. Four positive colonies were obtained. Two of the four were identified as nucleobindin, a calcium binding protein and a putative antigen to which anti-nuclear antibodies are generated in mice with a disorder that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus. Nucleobindin has a leucine zipper, EF hands, and a signal peptide sequence and is thought to localize to the nucleus as well as being secreted. The specificity of intehraction between G alpha i2 and nucleobindin was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. Transfection of G alpha i2 and nucleobindin in COS cells increased G alpha i2 expression relative to cells transfected with G alpha i2 and mock vector. Our results indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system provides a means to identify novel proteins that interact with G alpha proteins. Nucleobindin appears to represent one of those protein.
be a highly efficient calcium phosphate transfection protocol capable of achieving 100% transfection efficiency of reporter genes transiently expressed in the human hepatoma cell lines HuH7 and HepG2. This procedure, a modification of that described by Chen and Okayama, is reliable, reproducible, and eliminates the requirement for the inclusion of cotransfected internal control plasmids. While Chen and Okayama described the pH of the 2x BBS (N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline) and DNA concentration as being critical factors for optimal transfection efficiency, we show that a reduced and strictly monitored standing time of the DNA/CaCl2/2x BBS cocktail prior to addition to cultured cells is essential for a particular combination of pH and DNA concentration. We also show that the inclusion of internal control plasmids can inhibit reporter gene activity in a promoter- and dose-dependent manner. The method so described is also applicable for the transfection of other mammalian cell lines including COS and HeLa, and conceivably for the generation of stable transfectants at high frequenc.
as used to select co-transfected cells expressing plasmid-encoded ion channels. Adherent cells were cotransfected by the CaPO4 method with a plasmid encoding a cell surface marker (CD8) along with another plasmid encoding an ion channel. At 1-3 days post-transfection, the cells were suspended, treated with a biotinylated CD8-specific antibody and placed into streptavidin-coated bacterial petri dishes. After 2 h, these dishes were washed with a saline solution to remove cells that did not adhere to the streptavidin-coated dishes. By using molar ratios of &gt; or = 8:1 of the ion channel encoding plasmid to the CD8 plasmid, we found that &gt; or = 50% of the panned cells that adhered to coated dishes were positive for expression of the co-selected gene. Cells expressing plasmid-encoded channels (voltage-dependent sodium channels or cystic fibrosis transregulator chloride channels) were assayed using whole-cell recording, perforated-patch recording and single-channel recording. The method was tested on tsA201 and NIH3T3 cells, the latter of which transfected very poorly (usually &lt; 4% efficiency) with our standard protocols. When the co-selected plasmid encoded the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene, it was possible to determine by histological assay the percentage of positively transfected cells (with and without panning). Panning in some cases increased the percentage of positively cotransfected cells by more than 20-fold. This technique is particularly useful when selecting co-transfected cells for electro-physiological recordings on individual cell.
ns are ~20-amino acid peptides present in predatory marine snail venoms that function as allosteric antagonists of ion channels of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). These peptides possess a high percentage of post-/co-translationally modified amino acids, particularly γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Appropriately spaced Gla residues allow binding of functional divalent cations, which induces end-to-end α-helices in many conantokins. A smaller number of these peptides additionally contain 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp). Hyp should prevent adoption of the metal ion-induced full α-helix, with unknown functional consequences. To address this disparity, as well as the role of Hyp in conantokins, we have solved the high resolution three-dimensional solution structure of a Gla/Hyp-containing 18-residue conantokin, conRl-B, by high field NMR spectroscopy. We show that Hyp(10) disrupts only a small region of the α-helix of the Mn(2+)·peptide complex, which displays cation-induced α-helices on each terminus of the peptide. The function of conRl-B was examined by measuring its inhibition of NMDA/Gly-mediated current through NMDAR ion channels in mouse cortical neurons. The conRl-B displays high inhibitory selectivity for subclasses of NMDARs that contain the functionally important GluN2B subunit. Replacement of Hyp(10) with N(8)Q results in a Mg(2+)-complexed end-to-end α-helix, accompanied by attenuation of NMDAR inhibitory activity. However, replacement of Hyp(10) with Pro(10) allowed the resulting peptide to retain its inhibitory property but diminished its GluN2B specificity. Thus, these modified amino acids, in specific peptide backbones, play critical roles in their subunit-selective inhibition of NMDAR ion channels, a finding that can be employed to design NMDAR antagonists that function at ion channels of distinct NMDAR subclasse.
en prothrombin is proteolytically converted by factor Xa to the active protease thrombin in a reaction that is accelerated &gt;3,000-fold by cofactor Va. This physiologically important effect is paradigmatic of analogous cofactor-dependent reactions in the coagulation and complement cascades, but its structural determinants remain poorly understood. Prothrombin has three linkers connecting the N-terminal Gla domain to kringle-1 (Lnk1), the two kringles (Lnk2), and kringle-2 to the C-terminal protease domain (Lnk3). Recent developments indicate that the linkers, and particularly Lnk2, confer on the zymogen significant flexibility in solution and enable prothrombin to sample alternative conformations. The role of this flexibility in the context of prothrombin activation was tested with several deletions. Removal of Lnk2 in almost its entirety (ProTΔ146-167) drastically reduces the enhancement of thrombin generation by cofactor Va from &gt;3,000-fold to 60-fold because of a significant increase in the rate of activation in the absence of cofactor. Deletion of Lnk2 mimics the action of cofactor Va and offers insights into how prothrombin is activated at the molecular level. The crystal structure of ProTΔ146-167 reveals a contorted architecture where the domains are not vertically stacked, kringle-1 comes within 9 Å of the protease domain, and the Gla-domain primed for membrane binding comes in contact with kringle-2. These findings broaden our molecular understanding of a key reaction of the blood coagulation cascade where cofactor Va enhances activation of prothrombin by factor Xa by compressing Lnk2 and morphing prothrombin into a conformation similar to the structure of ProTΔ146-16.
thoma elasticum (PXE) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive calcification of soft connective tissues. The pathogenesis is still hard to pin down. In PXE dermal fibroblasts, in addition to impaired carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent inhibitor matrix Gla protein (MGP), we have also demonstrated an up-regulation of alkaline phosphatase activity. In the light of these data we have suggested that both calcium and phosphate metabolism might be locally altered, both pathways acting in synergy on the occurrence of matrix calcificatio.
y aims to better explore if cultured PXE fibroblasts, compared to control cells, exhibit a modified inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) metabolism and are more responsive to pro-calcifying stimul.
uman dermal fibroblasts isolated from healthy individuals and from PXE patients were cultured for different time points in standard and in pro-calcifying media. The expression of ANKH/ANKH, ENPP1/PC1, ALPL/TNAP, SPP1/OPN was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. TNAP activity was measured by spectrophotometric analyses, whereas calcification was investigated by light and electron microscopy as well as by micro-analytical technique.
esence of pro-calcifying stimuli, dermal fibroblasts alter their phenotype favouring matrix mineralization. In particular, ENPP1/PC1 and SPP1/OPN expression, as well as TNAP activity, was differently expressed in control and in PXE fibroblasts. Moreover, in pathologic cells the ratio between factors favouring and reducing PPi availability exhibits a more pronounced shift towards a pro-calcifying balanc.
blasts are more susceptible to pro-calcifying stimuli and in these cells an altered PPi metabolism contributes to matrix calcificatio.
calcification is recognized as a common complication in some patients, such as chronic renal failure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of sodium thiosulfate (STS) for the transdifferentiation of human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells induced by high-level phosphate. All human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were divided into STS group 1 (treatment with STS) and STS group 2 (culture in a medium containing a high level of phosphate). STS group 1 included a normal group, a high-level phosphate group, and other subgroups based on treatment with different concentrations of STS. Cells of STS group 2 were cultured in a medium containing a high level of phosphate for 72 hours, and then divided into a high-phosphate control group and other subgroups based on treatment with different concentrations of STS. The mRNA and protein expressions of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), core binding factor α-1 (Cbfα-1), and matrix Gla protein (MGP) were detected. Meanwhile, calcium concentration and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activation were measured. In STS group 1, the mRNA levels of BMP-2 and Cbfα-1 were elevated significantly in the high-level phosphate group compared with the normal group (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). However, both gene expressions were attenuated in the STS-treated groups (vs. normal group, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). MGP mRNA levels were reduced in the high-level phosphate group (vs. normal group, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). In the STS-treated groups, mRNA expression of MGP was elevated compared to the high-level phosphate group (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). In STS group 2, expression of MGP was enhanced significantly (vs. high-phosphate control group, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) with both BMP-2 and Cbfα-1 reducing in the STS-treated groups (vs. high-phosphate-control group, p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). STS attenuates calcium concentration and ALP activation. It can reverse osteoblast differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and modulate the expressions of calcification-related factor.
H is projected to decrease by up to 0.5 units by 2100 (a process known as ocean acidification, OA), reducing the calcium carbonate saturation state of the oceans. The coastal ocean is expected to experience periods of even lower carbonate saturation state because of the inherent natural variability of coastal habitats. Thus, in order to accurately project the impact of OA on the coastal ocean, we must first understand its natural variability. The production of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) by marine algae and the release of DMSP's breakdown product dimethylsulphide (DMS) are often related to environmental stress. This study investigated the spatiotemporal response of tropical macroalgae (Padina sp., Amphiroa sp. and Turbinaria sp.) and the overlying water column to natural changes in reefal carbonate chemistry. We compared macroalgal intracellular DMSP and water column DMSP+DMS concentrations between the environmentally stable reef crest and environmentally variable reef flat of the fringing Suleman Reef, Egypt, over 45-hour sampling periods. Similar diel patterns were observed throughout: maximum intracellular DMSP and water column DMS/P concentrations were observed at night, coinciding with the time of lowest carbonate saturation state. Spatially, water column DMS/P concentrations were highest over areas dominated by seagrass and macroalgae (dissolved DMS/P) and phytoplankton (particulate DMS/P) rather than corals. This research suggests that macroalgae may use DMSP to maintain metabolic function during periods of low carbonate saturation state. In the reef system, seagrass and macroalgae may be more important benthic producers of dissolved DMS/P than corals. An increase in DMS/P concentrations during periods of low carbonate saturation state may become ecologically important in the future under an OA regime, impacting larval settlement and increasing atmospheric emissions of DM.
m phosphate (Pi) levels represent a major issue in dialysis patients, because associate with secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular calcification (VC), and cardiovascular outcomes. In this population, calcimimetics are used to control secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and, more recently, to delay the progression of VC. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the direct effects of the calcimimetic calindol on the progression of high Pi-induced V.
lar smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were incubated with high Pi concentrations, and the effects of calindol were investigated on vascular calcium deposition and VSMC osteoblastic differentiatio.
inhibited calcium deposition concentration-dependently with a maximal inhibition of 64.0 ± 5.2% achieved at 100 nM. Furthermore, calindol was able to partially prevent the high Pi-induced bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) expression upregulation (32.4 ± 4.6% of inhibition; p &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, the pretreatment with calindol enhanced the matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene expression significantly, compared to high Pi-treated cells (40.2 ± 6.6% of increase, p &lt; 0.01.
sion, we demonstrated that the calcimimetic calindol prevents high Pi-induced VC by affecting osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. In particular, the inhibitory effect of calindol on VC is probably due to its stimulatory role on the calcium-sensing receptor, leading to an increase in the synthesis of MGP by VSMC.
y was aimed to explore the role of serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and fetuin-A in the calcium-phosphate metabolism and their predicting value in coronary artery calcification in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study included 64 patients who receive hemodialysis in our hospital. The serum FGF-23, MGP and fetuin-A were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELlSA). Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was evaluated by coronary artery computed tomography scan. The 64 patients (30 males, 34 females, 60.6 ± 11.3 years of age) received an average dialysis vintage of 6.88 ± 2.94 years. We divided the CACS into three levels, and 13 (20.31%), 16 (25%), and 35 (54.69%) exhibited a CACS of 0-100, 100-400, and &gt;400, respectively. Dialysis vintage, serum FGF-23, fetuin-A, phosphorus and high-density lipoprotein-C levels were identified as independent variables of CACS by stepwise multiple regression analysis. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that serum FGF-23 and fetuin-A were useful for identifying CAC in MHD patients. The cut-off value corresponding to the highest Youden's index was serum FGF-23 ≥ 256 pg/mL and fetuin-A ≤ 85 μg/mL, which was defined as the optimal predictors of CAC. Different combinations of serum FGF-23 and fetuin-A in parallel or in series effectively boosted the identification of CAC. The incidence of CAC is high in MHD patients. Serum FGF-23 and fetuin-A levels are closely correlated with CA.
ased phosphate binders are used to control hyperphosphatemia; however, they promote hypercalcemia and may accelerate aortic calcification. Here we compared the effect of a phosphate binder containing calcium acetate and magnesium carbonate (CaMg) to that of sevelamer carbonate on the development of medial calcification in rats with chronic renal failure induced by an adenine diet for 4 weeks. After 1 week, rats with chronic renal failure were treated with vehicle, 375 or 750 mg/kg CaMg, or 750 mg/kg sevelamer by daily gavage for 5 weeks. Renal function was significantly impaired in all groups. Vehicle-treated rats with chronic renal failure developed severe hyperphosphatemia, but this was controlled in treated groups, particularly by CaMg. Neither CaMg nor sevelamer increased serum calcium ion levels. Induction of chronic renal failure significantly increased serum PTH, dose-dependently prevented by CaMg but not sevelamer. The aortic calcium content was significantly reduced by CaMg but not by sevelamer. The percent calcified area of the aorta was significantly lower than vehicle-treated animals for all three groups. The presence of aortic calcification was associated with increased sox9, bmp-2, and matrix gla protein expression, but this did not differ in the treatment groups. Calcium content in the carotid artery was lower with sevelamer than with CaMg but that in the femoral artery did not differ between groups. Thus, treatment with either CaMg or sevelamer effectively controlled serum phosphate levels in CRF rats and reduced aortic calcificatio.
 of osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL) to osteoprotegerin (OPG) determines the delicate balance between bone resorption and synthesis. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the possible role of OPGL and OPG in the bone metabolism of rats exposed to fluoride and the protective or aggravating effect of calcium (Ca). In a 6-month study, 270 weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 70 and 90&nbsp;g were divided randomly into six groups of 45 rats in each group. Three groups (groups I, III, and V)served as controls and drank deionized water and were fed purified rodent diets containing either 1,000&nbsp;mg Ca/kg (low Ca), 5,000&nbsp;mg Ca/kg (normal Ca), or 20,000&nbsp;mg Ca/kg (high Ca). The three experimental groups (groups II, IV, and VI) were given the same diets but they drank water containing 100&nbsp;mg F ion/L (from NaF). Every 2&nbsp;months 15 rats were randomly selected from each group and sacrificed for the study. The ratio of OPGL mRNA to OPG mRNA was significantly increased by the sixth month in the distal femur joints of the F-exposed rats. Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and serum calcitonin activity in the F-exposed groups was increased, although changes were not apparent in the serum alkaline phosphatase or Gla-containing proteins, especially in the low calcium and high calcium diet F-exposed groups. The results indicated that OPG and OPGL may play important roles in skeletal fluorosis, and that fluoride may enhance osteoclast formation and induce osteoclastic bone destruction. A high Ca diet did not play a protective role, but rather may aggravate the damage of fluorid.
thoma elasticum (PXE) is a multisystem ectopic mineralization disorder caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene. Warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant, is associated with increased mineralization of the arterial blood vessels and cardiac valves. We hypothesized that warfarin may accelerate ectopic tissue mineralization in PXE, with clinical consequences. To test this hypothesis, we developed a model in which Abcc6(-/-) mice, which recapitulate features of PXE, were fed a diet supplemented with warfarin and vitamin K1. Warfarin action was confirmed by significantly increased serum levels of oxidized vitamin K. For mice placed on a warfarin-containing diet, quantitative chemical and morphometric analyses revealed massive accumulation of mineral deposits in a number of tissues. Mice fed a warfarin-containing diet were also shown to have abundant uncarboxylated form of matrix Gla protein, which allowed progressive tissue mineralization to ensue. To explore the clinical relevance of these findings, 1747 patients with PXE from the approximately 4000 patients in the PXE International database were surveyed about the use of warfarin. Of the 539 respondents, 2.6% reported past or&nbsp;present use of warfarin. Based on the prevalence of PXE (approximately 1:50,000), thousands of patients with PXE worldwide may be at risk for worsening of PXE as a result of warfarin therap.
calcification (VC) is prevalent in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. Factors promoting calcification include abnormalities in mineral metabolism, particularly high phosphate levels. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is a classical inducer of in vitro VC. Recently, an inverse relationship between serum magnesium concentrations and VC has been reported. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of magnesium on Pi-induced VC at the cellular level using primary HAVSM.
 fixed HAVSMC were assessed during 14 days in the presence of Pi with increasing concentrations of magnesium (Mg(2+)) chloride. Mineralization was measured using quantification of calcium, von Kossa and alizarin red stainings. Cell viability and secretion of classical VC markers were also assessed using adequate tests. Involvement of transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) 7 was assessed using 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2-APB) inhibito.
tion with Mg(2+) significantly decreased Pi-induced VC in live HAVSMC, no effect was found in fixed cells. At potent concentrations in Pi-induced HAVSMC, Mg(2+) significantly improved cell viability and restored to basal level increased secretions of osteocalcin and matrix gla protein, whereas a decrease in osteopontin secretion was partially restored. The block of TRPM7 with 2-APB at 10(-4) M led to the inefficiency of Mg(2+) to prevent V.
g Mg(2+) concentrations significantly reduced VC, improved cell viability and modulated secretion of VC markers during cell-mediated matrix mineralization clearly pointing to a cellular role for Mg(2+) and 2-APB further involved TRPM7 and a potential Mg(2+) entry to exert its effects. Further investigations are needed to shed light on additional cellular mechanism(s) by which Mg(2+) is able to prevent V.
ation of elastic fibers in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) has been associated with low levels of carboxylated matrix gla protein (MGP), most likely as a consequence of reduced vitamin K (vit K) availability. Unexpectedly, vit K supplementation does not exert beneficial effects on soft connective tissue mineralization in the PXE animal model. To understand the effects of vit K supplementation and in the attempt to interfere with pathways leading to the accumulation of calcium and phosphate within PXE-mineralized soft connective tissues, we have conducted in vitro studies on dermal fibroblasts isolated from control subjects and from PXE patients. Cells were cultured in standard conditions and in calcifying medium (CM) in the presence of vit K1 and K2, or levamisole, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) inhibitor. Control and PXE fibroblasts were characterized by a similar dose-dependent uptake of both vit K1 and vit K2, thus promoting a significant increase of total protein carboxylation in all cell lines. Nevertheless, MGP carboxylation remained much less in PXE fibroblasts. Interestingly, PXE fibroblasts exhibited a significantly higher ALP activity. Consistently, the mineralization process induced in vitro by a long-term culture in CM appeared unaffected by vit K, whereas it was abolished by levamisol.
lation factor II (ACF II), a coagulation factor X- binding protein from the venom of Agkistrodon acutus has both anticoagulant and hypotensive activities. Previous studies show that ACF II binds specifically with activated factor X (FXa) in a Ca(2+) -dependent manner and inhibits intrinsic coagulation pathway. In this study, the inhibition of extrinsic coagulation pathway by ACF II was measured in vivo by prothrombin time assay and the binding of ACF II to factor IX (FIX) was investigated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The results indicate that ACF II also inhibits extrinsic coagulation pathway, but does not inhibit thrombin activity. ACF II also binds with FIX with high binding affinity in a Ca(2+) -dependent manner and their maximal binding occurs at about 0.1 mM Ca(2+) . ACF II has similar binding affinity to FIX and FX as determined by SPR. Ca(2+) has a slight effect on the secondary structure of FIX as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Ca(2+) ions are required to maintain in vivo function of FIX Gla domain for its recognition of ACF II. However, Ca(2+) at high concentrations (&gt;0.1 mM) inhibits the binding of ACF II to FIX. Ca(2+) functions as a switch for the binding between ACF II and FIX. ACF II extends activated partial thromboplastin time more strongly than prothrombin time, suggesting that the binding of ACF II with FIX may play a dominant role in the anticoagulation of ACF II in viv.
protein (BGP), also known as osteocalcin, is one of the most abundant γ-carboxylated noncollagenous protein in bone matrix and plays important roles in mineralization and calcium ion homeostasis. BGP is synthesized specifically in osteoblasts; however, its precise function in bone metabolism has not been fully elucidated. To investigate the in vivo function of human BGP (hBGP), we generated CAG-GFP(floxed)-hBGP transgenic mice carrying a transgene cassette composed of the promoter and a floxed GFP linked to hBGP cDNA. The mice were crossed with ColI-Cre mice, which express the Cre recombinase driven by the mouse collagen type 1a1 gene promoter, to obtain hBGP(ColI) conditional transgenic mice that expressed human BGP in osteoblasts. The hBGP(ColI) mice did not survive more than 2days after birth. The analysis of the 18.5-day post coitum fetuses of the hBGP(ColI) mice revealed that they displayed abnormal skeletal growth such as deformity of the rib and short femur and cranium lengths. Moreover, increased BGP levels were detected in the serum of the neonates. These findings indicate that hBGP expression in osteoblasts resulted in the abnormal skeletal growth in the mice. Our study provides a valuable model for understanding the fundamental role of BGP in viv.
igated the solution structure and dynamics of the human anti-coagulation protein Z (PZ) in the complex with protein Zdependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) to order to understand key structural changes in the presence and absence of Ca(2+). Structural features of the complete complex of PZ-ZPI are poorly understood due to lack of complete atomic model of the PZ-ZPI complex. We have constructed a model of the complete PZ-ZPI complex and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the solvated PZ-ZPI complex with and without Ca(2+) was achieved for 100ns. It is consider that the Ω-loop of GLA domains interacts with negatively charged biological membranes in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. The PZ exerts its role as cofactor in a similar way. However, we used solvent-equilibrated dynamics to show structural features of the PZ-ZPI complex in the presence and the absence of Ca(2+)ions. We observed that the distance between the interacting sites of the ZPI with the PZ and the GLA domain decreases in the presence of Ca(2+) ions. Further, we postulated that the calculated distance between the dominant plane of the Ca(2+) ions and Ser196 of the pseudo-catalytic triad of the PZ is similar to the equivalent distance of FXa. This suggests that the central role of the PZ in the blood coagulation may be to align the inhibitory site of the ZPI with the active site of the FXa, which is depends on the interaction of the calcium bound GLA domain of the PZ with the active membran.
ctor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a slow tight-binding inhibitor that inhibits factor (F)Xa in a biphasic fashion: a rapid formation of loose FXa·TFPI encounter complex is followed by slow rearrangement into a tight FXa·TFPI* complex in which the Kunitz-2 (K2) domain of TFPI binds and inhibits FXa. In the current study, full-length TFPI (TFPIfl) and various truncated TFPI constructs were used to assess the importance of TFPI domains other than K2 in the inhibition of FXa. In the absence of Ca2+ ions, FXa was more effectively inhibited by TFPIfl than Gla-domain less FXa. In turn, Ca2+ ions impaired FXa inhibition by TFPIfl but not by TFPI constructs that lack the C-terminus. This suggests that, in absence of Ca2+ ions, interactions between the C-terminus of TFPI and the Gla-domain of FXa promote FXa-inhibition. TFPIfl and K2K3 had similar efficiencies for encounter complex formation. However, K2K3 showed monophasic inhibition instead of biphasic inhibition, indicating absence of rearrangement into a tight complex. K1K2 and TFPI1-161 showed biphasic inhibition, but had less efficient encounter complex formation than TFPIfl. Finally, K2K3 was a 10-fold more efficient FXa- inhibitor than K2. These results indicate that K3-C-terminus enhances the formation of encounter complex and that K1 is required for isomerisation of the encounter- into tight complex. Since TFPIfl has a 10-fold higher Ki than K2K3-C-terminus, we propose that K1 is not only required for the transition of the loose to the tight FXa·TFPI* complex, but also inhibits FXa·TFPI encounter complex formation. This inhibitory activity is counteracted by K3 and C-terminu.
ibrium of inhibitors and inducers plays an important role in the mineralization of dentin during dentinogenesis. High-temperature requirement protein A1 (HtrA1) is a novel bone mineralization inhibitor involved in physiological and pathological bone formation. However, the expression of HtrA1 in tooth mineralization is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the localization and quantity of HtrA1 and its possible related molecules during induced reparative dentin formatio.
 randomly sacrificed after direct pulp capping on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Maxillary segments were obtained and routinely prepared for histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, quantum dots-based double immunofluorescence, and CRi's Nuance imaging system (CRI, Woburn, MA)-based quantitative determinatio.
e measure values of reparative dentin significantly increased on day 7 and continued to increase until day 21. HtrA1, matrix Gla protein (MGP), nestin, and bone sialoprotein were positively stained and colocalized in the odontoblasts and/or odontoblast-like cells zone and reparative dentin during induced reparative dentin formation. The expressions of HtrA1 and MGP were significantly enhanced after direct pulp capping on day 7 and did not significantly change between days 7, 14, and day 21. Both expressions of HtrA1 and MGP were positively correlated with the square measure values of reparative dentin; however, no correlation was found between the expressions of HtrA1 and MG.
ld be observed and might possibly be involved in the process of reparative dentin formation associated with MG.
of Ca(2+) as a key and pivotal second messenger in cells depends largely on a wide number of heterogeneous so-called calcium binding proteins (CBP), which have the ability to bind this ion in specific domains. CBP contribute to the control of Ca(2+) concentration in the cytosol and participate in numerous cellular functions by acting as Ca(2+) transporters across cell membranes or as Ca(2+)-modulated sensors, i.e., decoding Ca(2+) signals. In this chapter we review the main Ca(2+)-modulated CBP, starting with those intracellular CBP that contain the structural EF-hand domain: parvalbumin, calmodulin, S100 proteins and calcineurin. Then, we address intracellular CBP lacking the EF-hand domain: CBP within intracellular Ca(2+) stores (paying special attention to calreticulin and calsequestrin), annexins and proteins that contain a C2 domain, such as protein kinase C (PKC) or sinaptotagmin. Finally, extracellular CBP have been classified in six groups, according to their Ca(2+) binding structures: (i) EF-hand domains; (ii) EGF-like domains; (iii) γ-carboxyl glutamic acid (GLA)-rich domains; (iv) cadherin domains; (v) Ca(2+)-dependent (C)-type lectin-like domains; (vi) Ca(2+)-binding pockets of family C G-protein-coupled receptors. For all proteins, we briefly review their structure, location and function and additionally their potential as pharmacological targets in several human disease.
failure, hydrophobic toxins accumulate in the blood circulation. To support hepatic function, extracorporeal blood purification systems have been developed, in which both cationic and neutral adsorbents are used to remove albumin-bound metabolites from blood. An issue of these systems is the additional removal of coagulation factors containing negatively charged γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) domains, which, in physiological conditions, are shielded by calcium ions. We hypothesized that complexation of calcium ions by citrate leads to exposure of negative Gla domains, resulting in their binding to the positively charged adsorbents. The data presented here confirm that the binding of coagulation factors containing Gla domains to positively charged polymers is enhanced in the presence of citrate as compared to heparin. This effect increased with increasing charge density of the polymer and has important implications for the clinical application of positively charged polymer.
he structure of matrix Gla-protein (MGP), its chemical characteristics, regulation of synthesis and post-translational modifications are described. The information on the structure of the MGP gene, its well distributed polymorphisms are presented. Factors that regulate expression and activity of MGP include vitamin D, retinoic acid, extracellular calcium ions, cytokines, and some hormones. It is emphasized that MGP is an important inhibitor of calcification of soft tissues. These properties of this protein are associated with the presence of residues of gamma-carboxiglutamic acid of its molecule. Four possible mechanisms of anticalcinogenic action of MGP are described: binding with calcium ions and crystals of hydroxyapatite, binding to extracellular matrix components, interaction with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) and elimination the effects of the latter, participation in the regulation of apoptosis. It is emphasized that the study of allelic variants of the MGP gene is important in the context of their possible association with the development of cardiovascular and other disease.
-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is an integral membrane protein responsible for the post-translational catalytic conversion of select glutamic acid (Glu) residues to γ-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) in vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins. Understanding the mechanism of carboxylation and the role of GGCX in the vitamin K cycle is of biological interest in the development of therapeutics for blood coagulation disorders. Historically, biophysical investigations and structural characterizations of GGCX have been limited due to complexities involving the availability of an appropriate model membrane system. In previous work, a hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX MS) platform was developed to study the structural configuration of GGCX in a near-native nanodisc phospholipid environment. Here we have applied the nanodisc-HX MS approach to characterize specific domains of GGCX that exhibit structural rearrangements upon binding the high-affinity consensus propeptide (pCon; AVFLSREQANQVLQRRRR). pCon binding was shown to be specific for monomeric GGCX-nanodiscs and promoted enhanced structural stability to the nanodisc-integrated complex while maintaining catalytic activity in the presence of carboxylation co-substrates. Noteworthy modifications in HX of GGCX were prominently observed in GGCX peptides 491-507 and 395-401 upon pCon association, consistent with regions previously identified as sites for propeptide and glutamate binding. Several additional protein regions exhibited minor gains in solvent protection upon propeptide incorporation, providing evidence for a structural reorientation of the GGCX complex in association with VKD carboxylation. The results herein demonstrate that nanodisc-HX MS can be utilized to study molecular interactions of membrane-bound enzymes in the absence of a complete three-dimensional structure and to map dynamic rearrangements induced upon ligand bindin.
in (OC) is witamino-K dependent calcium-binding protein comprising three gamma carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla) which determines a strong bond with hydroxyapatite. In vitamin K deficiency and/or increased bone resorption undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) appears in the blood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of Glu-OC and markers of bone metabolism and their impact on coronary artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal failure treated with repeated hemodialysis. The study included 68 patients (29 women and 39 men) aged 60.3 +/- 12.3 years hemodialysis period 24.5 +/- 4.8 months. Control group consisted of 35 healthy volunteers comparable in terms of age and gender. CACS was evaluated based on multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). Measurement of carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC) and Glu-OC, bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5) were assessed by ELISA and iPTH by Nichols method. Present study demonstrated that the Gla-OC and Glu-OC in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than the control group 116.37 +/- 70.01 ng/ml and 93.72 +/- 112.63 ng/ml versus 19.51 +/- 3.78 ng/ml and 4.88 +/- 2.63 ng/ ml; p &lt;0.001. Glu-OC level correlated significantly with iPTH, bALP, TRAP5 (p &lt;0.001) and CaSc (p &lt;0.014.
sults indicate a significant correlation between Glu-OC and assessed markers of bone metabolism. 2. Research has indicated a link between bone metabolism and the degree of calcification in the coronary arterie.
 (vitamin K1 or phylloquinone and vitamin K2, a series of menaquinones [MKs]) is involved in the production of bone and matrix amino acid γ-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla) proteins, regulating bone and vascular calcification. Low vitamin K concentrations are associated with increased risks of fractures and vascular calcification, and frequent complications in hemodialysis patients. We carried out an observational study to establish the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency and to assess the relationship between vitamin K status, vertebral fractures, vascular calcification, and survival in 387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year. We determined plasma levels of vitamin K compound, bone-Gla-protein, matrix-Gla-protein, and routine biochemistry. Vertebral fractures (reduction in vertebral body height by ≥20%) and aortic and iliac calcifications were also investigated in a spine (D(5) -L(4)) radiograph. Three-year patient survival was analyzed. Important proportions of patients had deficiency of MK7 (35.4%), vitamin K1 (23.5%), and MK4 (14.5%). A total of 55.3% of patients had vertebral fractures, 80.6% had abdominal aorta calcification, and 56.1% had iliac calcification. Vitamin K1 deficiency was the strongest predictor of vertebral fractures (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.26). MK4 deficiency was a predictor of aortic calcification (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.14-7.01), whereas MK5 deficiency actually protected against it (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15-0.95). MK7 deficiency was a predictor of iliac calcification (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.03-2.60). The presence of vertebral fractures was also a predictor of vascular calcifications (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.00-3.08). Increased alkaline phosphatase and C reactive protein (CRP), age, and cerebrovascular events were predictors of mortality. Our study suggests that the vitamin K system may be important for preserving bone mass and avoiding vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients, pointing out a possible role of vitamin K in bone and vascular health. Based on our results, we suggest that the general population should also be studied for vitamin K deficiency as a possible cause of both vertebral fractures and vascular calcificatio.
igate the post-translational generation of Gla (γ-carboxy glutamic acid) from Glu (glutamic acid) by vitamin K carboxylase (VKC) in solvent. VKC is thought to convert vitamin K, in the vitamin K cycle, to an alkoxide-epoxide form, which then reacts with CO(2) to generate an essential ingredient in blood coagulation, γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). The generation of Gla from Glu is found to be exergenic (-15 kcal/mol) in aqueous solution with the SM6 method. We also produced the free energy profile for this model biochemical process with other solvent methods (polarizable continuum model, dielectric polarizable continuum model) and different dielectric constants. The biological implications are discusse.
 mechanisms for recombinant activated human FVII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven), a heterogeneously glycosylated protein, have yet to be fully elucidated, but may involve the liver. The effects of the gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) domain and the sialic acid content of the protein on rFVIIa clearance were investigated following intravenous administration of rFVIIa lacking the Gla domain, des(1-44) rFVIIa and asialo-rFVIIa in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and perfused rat livers. PK parameters for both rFVIIa and des(1-44) rFVIIa had similar biphasic clearance profiles, as well as half-lives ([t(1/2)]=80 and 88 minutes, respectively), while asialo-rFVIIa was cleared quickly (t(1/2)=21 minutes) with a linear clearance profile. Perfused liver studies with all proteins (10 nM) mirrored the trends in profiles observed in the PK study. rFVIIa and des(1-44) rFVIIa were cleared to a similar extent, 41% and 35%, respectively, after 1 h, whereas plasma-derived FVII from humans (which has a higher sialylation content than rFVIIa) was cleared to a lesser extent (21%). Asialo-rFVIIa, on the other hand, was almost totally cleared and when an excess of asialo-orosomucoid was added to the perfusate, its clearance was significantly reduced (by 34%) and also for rFVIIa, albeit to a lesser extent (by 14%). Together these data suggest that carbohydrate receptor(s) (e.g. the asialoglycoprotein receptor, ASGPR) play a role in asialo-rFVIIa and rFVIIa clearance. In vivo and liver clearance data correlated well showing similar trends and indicated that rFVIIa clearance is not affected by the Gla domain, but rather by a subpopulation of N-glycosylated structures on rFVII.
 (as phylloquinone and menaquinones) is an essential cofactor for the conversion of peptide-bound glutamate to gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) residues in a number of specialized Gla-containing proteins. The only unequivocal deficiency outcome is a bleeding syndrome caused by an inability to synthesize active coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, although there is growing evidence for roles for vitamin K in bone and vascular health. An adult daily intake of about 100 microg of phylloquinone is recommended for the maintenance of hemostasis. Traditional coagulation tests for assessing vitamin K status are nonspecific and insensitive. Better tests include measurements of circulating vitamin K and inactive proteins such as undercarboxylated forms of factor II and osteocalcin to assess tissue and functional status, respectively. Common risk factors for vitamin K deficiency in the hospitalized patient include inadequate dietary intakes, malabsorption syndromes (especially owing to cholestatic liver disease), antibiotic therapy, and renal insufficiency. Pregnant women and their newborns present a special risk category because of poor placental transport and low concentrations of vitamin K in breast milk. Since 2000, the Food and Drug Administration has mandated that adult parenteral preparations should provide a supplemental amount of 150 microg phylloquinone per day in addition to that present naturally, in variable amounts, in the lipid emulsion. Although this supplemental daily amount is probably beneficial in preventing vitamin K deficiency, it may be excessive for patients taking vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and jeopardize their anticoagulant control. Natural forms of vitamin K have no proven toxicit.
mma-carboxy glutamic acid protein (MGP) is a 10-kDa secreted protein containing five residues of the vitamin K-dependent calcium binding amino acid gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). This study was carried out to examine the effects of MGP gene promoter polymorphism (T-138C) on blood lead levels (BLL) and hematological parameters in 113 battery manufacturing unit workers occupationally exposed to lead and 102 controls. Genotypes for the MGP T-138C polymorphism were determined by PCR and restriction fragment length digestion. BLL were determined by Anode Stripping Voltammetry using ESA Model 3010B Lead analyzer. Complete blood picture (CBP) was analyzed using ADVIA Cell counter for each sample. The frequencies of MGP-TT, CT and CC genotypes in our population were 38.6%, 44.3%, and 17.2%, respectively. The frequencies for T and C alleles were 0.612 and 0.386, respectively. Although BLL did not differ significantly among genotypes; they were higher in workers with TT/CT genotype compared to CC genotype subjects (76-88 microg/dL vs 22-45 microg/dL, p &gt; 0.05). About 29.2% of volunteers (n = 33) from the occupationally exposed group had hemoglobin levels below 10.0 gms/dl. There was no significant difference in total white cell count and platelet count between occupational and non-exposed groups. The possible role of SNPs in the promoter region of MGP gene with relation to lead toxicity was investigated for the first time in the Indian population; although significance could not be achieved in this study, further assessments over a larger population size may help in better understanding of the consequences of lead exposur.
in K-dependent carboxylase carries out the posttranslational modification of specific glutamate residues in proteins to gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) in the presence of reduced vitamin K, molecular oxygen, and carbon dioxide. In the process, reduced vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide, which is subsequently reduced to vitamin K, by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) for use in the carboxylation reaction. The modification has a wide range of physiological implications, including hemostasis, bone calcification, and signal transduction. The enzyme interacts with a high affinity gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence (gamma-CRS) of the substrate and carries out multiple modifications of the substrate before the product is released. This mechanism ensures complete carboxylation of the Gla domain of the coagulation factors, which is essential for their biological activity. gamma-Carboxylation, originally discovered in mammals, is widely distributed in the animal kingdom. It has been characterized in sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis), in flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and in marine snails (Conus textile), none of which have a blood coagulation system similar to mammals. The cone snails express a large array of gamma-carboxylated peptides that modulate the activity of ion channels. These findings have led to the suggestion that gamma-carboxylation is an extracellular posttranslational modification that antedates the divergence of molluscs, arthropods, and chordates. I will first summarize recent understanding of gamma-carboxylase and gamma-carboxylation gleaned from experiments using the mammalian enzyme, and then I will briefly describe the available information on gamma-carboxylation in D. melanogaster and C. textil.
nd widely available animals such as rats are commonly used to evaluate antithrombotic drug candidates in vivo. However, the isolation and purification of FVII from rats and other species is very challenging because they are present in extremely low levels in plasma (approximately 10 nM). Furthermore, purification of FVII from other coagulation factors present in the plasma such as prothrombin, factor IX and factor X can often be very challenging and labor-intensive. To facilitate studies on the role of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation in rats, a full-length cDNA-encoding rat factor VII was isolated using polymerase-mediated DNA amplification using a rat liver cDNA library. The cDNA codes for a 41-residue signal/propeptide region, followed by a 405-residue mature protein consisting of the light chain with gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (gla) including epidermal growth factor domains (EGF) and the heavy chain with the serine protease catalytic domain. Rat factor VII cDNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and several cell lines that constitutively express rat factor VII were established. The media from the stable lines expressing recombinant rat FVII were rapidly screened for functional activity and were found to normalize clotting time of FVII-depleted human plasma. The supernatants were also functionally active in the presence of tissue factor in chromogenic assays by measuring FVIIa activation using a tripeptide chromogenic substrate and in a two-stage, coupled assay measuring the generation of FXa. Recombinant rat FVII may be an important new tool in the development of novel antithrombotic drug.
nt of inhibitory antibodies is a serious complication of treatment with repeated factor IX infusions in a minority of patients with hemophilia B. Such antibodies detected in 8 patients have been characterized. Typing studies revealed that patients' immune response toward factor IX is highly heterogeneous and involves immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, preferentially IgG1 and IgG4. The preservation of the sequence and the 3-dimensional orientation of the amino acids constituting one epitope are highly important for the assembly of an antibody-antigen complex. To localize the epitopes on the factor IX molecule, an original approach was designed using a set of factor X chimeras carrying regions of factor IX. Results showed that some patients' antibodies were directed against both the domain containing the gamma-carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla domain) and the protease domain of factor IX. In contrast, no binding was observed to the epidermal growth factor-like domains or to the activation peptide. Functional characterization showed that the purified IgG from patients' serum inhibited the factor VIIIa-dependent activation of factor X. Moreover, patients' IgG directed against the Gla domain inhibited the binding of factor IX to phospholipids as well as the binding of factor VIII light chain to factor IXa. These data demonstrate that inhibitors appearing in patients with severe hemophilia B display specificity against restricted functional domains of factor I.
phorylated disulfide-bridged peptide, cyclo(Cys-Glu1-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Val-Gly-Met-Tyr9-Cys)-amide (termed G1) has been identified, by phage library, that binds to the Grb2-SH2 domain but not the src SH2 domain. Synthetic G1 blocks the Grb2-SH2 domain association (IC50 of 15.5 microM) with natural phosphopeptide ligands. As a new structural motif that binds to the Grb2-SH2 domain in a pTyr-independent manner, the binding affinity of G1 is contributed by the highly favored interactions of its structural elements interacting with the binding pocket of the protein. These interactions involve side-chains of amino acids Glu1, Tyr3, Glu4, Asn5, and Met8. Also a specific conformation is required for the cyclic peptide when bound to the protein. Ala scanning within G1 and molecular modeling analysis suggest a promising model in which G1 peptide binds in the phosphotyrosine binding site of the Grb2-SH2 domain in a beta-turn-like conformation. Replacement of Tyr3 or Asn5 with Ala abrogates the inhibitory activity of the peptide, indicating that G1 requires a Y-X-N consensus sequence similar to that found in natural pTyr-containing ligands, but without Tyr phosphorylation. Significantly, the Ala mutant of Glu1, i.e. the amino acid N-terminal to Y3, remarkably reduces the binding affinity. The position of the Glu1 side-chain is confirmed to provide a complementary role for pTyr3, as demonstrated by the low micromolar inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.02 microM) of the nonphosphorylated peptide 11, G1(Gla1), in which Glu1 was replaced by gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla.
-carboxy glutamic acid (gla) containing proteins have been shown recently to have a role in calcium oxalate urolithiasis. Therefore, the effect of carboxylation on calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) binding was studied in experimental hyperoxaluri.
sis was induced in experimental rats by oral feeding 1% ethylene glycol (EG). The microsomes were carboxylated in presence of reduced vitamin K and COM binding activity was determine.
l proteins adsorbed maximally with COM crystals. On carboxylation of the renal microsomal proteins, a significant increase in the COM crystal adsorption by 2.5-fold (p &lt; 0.001) was observed in the hyperoxaluric condition. Further cyboxylated microsomes of EG-treated rats showed significant binding with calcium oxalat.
y presents an increased COM adsorption after the carboxylation of renal microsomes of hyperoxaluric rat.
 occurring plasma factor XFriuli (pFXFr) is marginally activated by both the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways and has impaired catalytic potential. These studies were initiated to obtain confirmation that this molecule is multi-functionally defective due to the substitution of Ser for Pro at position 343 in the catalytic domain. By the Nelson-Long site-directed mutagenesis procedure a construct of cDNA in pRc/CMV was derived for recombinant factor XFriuli (rFXFr) produced in human embryonic (293) kidney cells. The rFXFr was purified and shown to have a molecular size identical to that of normal plasma factor X (pFX) by gel electrophoretic, and amino-terminal sequencing revealed normal processing cleavages. Using recombinant normal plasma factor X (rFXN) as a reference, the post-translational gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid (Gla) and beta-hydroxy aspartic acid (beta-OH-Asp) content of rFXFr was over 85% and close to 100%, respectively, of expected levels. The specific activities of rFXFr in activation and catalytic assays were the same as those of pFXFr. Molecular modeling suggested the involvement of a new H-bond between the side-chains of Ser-343 and Thr-318 as they occur in anti-parallel beta-pleated sheets near the substrate-binding pocket of pFXFr. These results support the conclusion that the observed mutation in pFXFr is responsible for its dysfunctional activation and catalytic potentials, and that it accounts for the moderate bleeding tendency in the homozygous individuals who possess this variant procoagulan.
clonal antibodies have been produced, which are specific for the Ca2+ or Sr2(+)-induced conformation of human factor IX. Certain, but not all, gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues in factor IX are involved in the epitope expression together with the conformation stabilized by the adjacent region of Gla-domain and a disulfide bridge. All the antibodies interfered with the binding of factor IX to phospholipids and inhibited the procoagulant activity of factors IX and IXa bet.
ts of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] on alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and the synthesis of gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid containing protein (BGP) were compared in phenotypically distinct cloned cell lines derived from the osteoblast-like rat osteogenic sarcoma line ROS 17/2-8. 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated AP activity and BGP synthesis in phenotypes which exhibited relatively low basal AP activity and high basal BGP levels. In contrast 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited AP activity in phenotypes that exhibited high basal AP activity. The latter cells had undetectable BGP levels and the synthesis of this protein failed to respond to the 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulus. In the cells that responded to 1,25(OH)2D3 with an increase in AP activity the effect of the hormone on AP could be blocked by actinomycin-D. However in the cells that responded to 1,25(OH)2D3 with inhibition of AP the effect of the hormone on AP was not influenced by actinomycin-D. The directly opposite effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the AP activity of the respective clones did not change qualitatively at different stages of culture and could not be accounted by differences in the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor status nor by different effects of the hormone on cell proliferation. These data raise the possibility that the response of AP to 1,25(OH)2D3 in osteoblastic cells depends on their state of phenotypic differentiation. The stimulatory effect of the hormone in low AP-producing cells might be related to differentiation promoting properties of 1,25(OH)2D3. The inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on AP, unlike the stimulatory effect of the hormone does not appear to be mediated by the classical mechanism of 1,25(OH)2D3 action on the genome and might be associated with dedifferentiated osteoblastic cell.
-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla)-containing protein of mammalian bone (BGP, also called osteocalcin) is a 49 amino acid polypeptide containing two to three residues of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. BGP is synthesized by osteoblastlike cells, and plasma BGP in laboratory animals is derived principally from recently synthesized BGP. These data, taken together with observations that plasma BGP levels are elevated in patients with disorders of high bone turnover, suggest that plasma BGP is a marker of osteoblast activity. Since low bone formation rates may play an important role in the loss of bone mass with age, we have examined the determinants of plasma BGP levels in aging subjects, using a region-specific radioimmunoassay for human BGP based on the synthetic C-terminal peptide hBGP37-49. In 147 carefully screened healthy subjects, aged 23-91, BGP did not change with age, whereas alkaline phosphatase (AP) showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.30, P less than 0.001). Creatinine clearance (GFR) declined by 0.9 ml/min/yr and correlated with both BGP (r = -0.21, P less than 0.001) and AP (r = -0.21, P less than 0.001). However, correlation of AP with age persisted after controlling for GFR. BGP was not correlated with serum PTH, urine Ca/GFR, or urine cAMP/GFR. In 48 patients with known parenchymal renal disease studied for comparison, plasma BGP was increased at a serum creatinine of greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dl. Our results indicate that plasma BGP, a specific marker of bone metabolism, is not predictably related to age per se. This result is in contrast to the age-related rise in total AP. Subtle changes in renal function can affect plasma BGP level.
ctosidase was isolated from a culture filtrate of Lenzites elegans (Spreng.) ex Pat. MB445947 grown on citric pectin as carbon source. It was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. The relative molecular mass of the native purified enzyme was 158 kDa determined by gel filtration and it is a homodimer (Mr subunits = 61 kDa). The optimal temperature for enzyme activity was in the range 60-80 °C. This α-galactosidase showed a high thermostability, retaining 94 % of its activity after preincubation at 60 °C for 2 h. The optimal pH for the enzyme was 4.5 and it was stable from pH 3 to 7.5 when the preincubation took place at 60 °C for 2 h. It was active against several α-galactosides such as p-nitrophenyl-α-D-galactopyranoside, α-D-melibiose, raffinose and stachyose. The α-galactosidase is a glycoprotein with 26 % of structural sugars. Galactose was a non-competitive inhibitor with a Ki = 22 mM versus p-nitrophenyl-α-D-galactoside and 12 mM versus α-D-melibiose as substrates. Glucose was a simple competitive inhibitor with a Ki = 10 mM. Cations such as Hg(2+) and p-chloromercuribenzoate were also inhibitors of this activity, suggesting the presence of -SH groups in the active site of the enzyme. On the basis of the sequence of the N-terminus (SPDTIVLDGTNFALN) the studied α-galactosidase would be a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 36 (GH 36). Given the high optimum temperature and heat stability of L. elegans α-galactosidase, this fungus may become a useful source of α-galactosidase production for multiple application.
eeds and husks of some plants belonging to leguminosae, Graminae, Compositae and Palmae were evaluated as carbon substrates to produce α-galactosidase (α-Gal) by the thermophilic fungus, Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 in solid substrate fermentation. The results showed that Cicer arietinum (chick pea seed) was the best substrate for α-Gal production. The crude enzyme was precipitated by ammonium sulphate (60%) and purified by gel filtration on sephadex G-100 followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Cellulose. The final purification fold of the enzyme was 30.42. The temperature and pH optima of purified α-Gal from Thielavia terrestris were 70 °C and 6.5, respectively. The enzyme showed high thermal stability at 70 °C and 75 °C and the half-life of the α-Gal at 90 °C was 45 min. Km of the purified enzyme was 1.31 mM. The purified enzyme was inhibited by Ag2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ at 5 mM and 10 mM. Also, EDTA, sodium arsenate, L-cysteine and iodoacetate inhibited the enzyme activity. On the other hand, Ca2+, Cu2+, K+ and Na+ slightly enhanced the enzyme activity at 5 mM while at 10 mM they caused inhibition. The molecular weight of the α-Gal was estimated to be 82 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This enzyme displays a number of biochemical properties that make it a potentially strong candidate for biotechnological and medicinal application.
ellular thermostable alpha-galactosidase producing Aspergillus terreus (GR) strain was isolated from soil sample using guar gum as sole source of carbon. It was purified to apparent homogeneity by acetone precipitation, gel filtration followed by DEAE-Sephacel chromatographic step. The purified enzyme showed a single band after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The molecular weight of the purified enzyme after SDS-PAGE was 108 kDa. The enzyme showed optimum pH and temperature of 5.0 and 65 degrees C, respectively, for artificial substrate pNPalphaGal. alpha-Galactosidase from A. terreus (GR) is found to be thermostable, as it was not inactivated after heating at 65 degrees C for 40 min. The K (m) for pNPalphaGal, oNPalphaGal, raffinose, and stachyose are 0.1, 0.28, 0.42, and 0.33 mM, respectively. Inhibitors such as 1,10-phenanthroline, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, mercaptoethanol, and urea have no effect, whereas N-bromosuccinamide inhibited enzyme activity by 100%. Among metal ions tested, Mg(2+), Ni(2+), Ca(2+), Co(2+), and Mn(2+) had no effect on enzyme activity, but Ag(+), Hg(2+), and Cu(2+) have inhibited complete activit.
ctosidase-producing fungus was screened out of 26 filamentous fungi isolated from soil by us. Phylogenetic analysis based on the alignment of 18S rDNA sequences, combined with the morphological identification, indicated that the strain F63 was a member of the genus Penicillium. The a-galactosidase from Penicillium sp. F63 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The molecular size of the purified enzyme is approximately 82kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE. The a-galactosidase has an optimum pH of 5.0 and an optimum temperature of 45 degrees C. The enzyme is stable between pH5.0 and 6.0 below 40 degrees C. The a-galactosidase activity is slightly inhibited by Ag+ , which is dissimilar to other a-galactosidases. Kinetic studies of the a-galactosidase showed that the Km and the Vmax for pNPG are 1.4mmol/L and 1.556mmol/L. min(-1) x mg- 1, respectively. The enzyme is able to degrade natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose and stachyose but not galactose-containing polysaccharides. The alpha-galactosidase was identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and its inner peptides were sequenced by ESI-MS/MS. The results show that the a-galactosidase is a novel on.
actosidase (alpha-Gal) enzyme, which is encoded by the melA gene hydrolyzes alpha-1,6 galactoside linkages found in sugars, such as raffinose and stachyose. These alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides (alpha-GOS), which are found in large quantities in vegetables, such as soy, can cause gastrointestinal disorders in sensitive individuals because monogastric animals (including humans) do not posses alpha-Gal in the gut. The use of microbial alpha-Gal is a promising alternative to eliminate alpha-GOS in soy-derived products. Using degenerate primers, the melA gene from Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum CRL722 was identified. The complete genomic sequence of melA (2223 bp), and of the genes flanking melA, were obtained using a combination of polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, and showed strong similarities with the alpha-Gal gene of thermophilic microorganisms. The alpha-Gal gene from L. fermentum CRL722 was cloned and the protein purified from cell-free extracts of the native and recombinant strains using various techniques (ion exchange chromatography, salt precipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ultra-filtration); Its main biochemical properties were determined. The enzyme was active at moderately high temperatures (55 degrees C) and stable at wide ranges of temperatures and pH. The thermostable alpha-Gal from L. fermentum CRL722 could thus be used for technological applications, such as the removal of alpha-GOS found in soy products. The complete melA gene could also be inserted in other micro-organisms, that can survive in the harsh conditions of the gut to degrade alpha-GOS in situ. Both strategies would improve the overall acceptability of soy-derived products by improving their nutritional valu.
has been developed for isolation and purification of the enzyme with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and alpha-galactosidase activities which included fractionation by ammonium sulphate and chromatography on TSK-gels Toyopearl HW-60 and Fractogel DEAE-650-s and Sepharose 6B. The enzyme was purified 600 times with the yield of 28%. The enzyme preparation did not contain fucosidase, invertase and proteolytic activities. Molecular mass of the enzyme from the data of gel-filtration on Sepharose 6B was 430 kDa, according to the data of electrophoresis in DS-PAAG--70 kDa. It is shown that acidic and hydrophobic aminoacids prevail in the enzyme molecule, the carbohydrate component containing galactose, mannose, glucosamine and two nonidentified hexosamines is also present there. The enzyme preparation is stable during 48 hours at 20 degrees C; its pH-optimum is at pH 3.5-4.1. Michaelis constants concerning n-nitrophenyl-alpha-N-acetylgalactopyranoside and n-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside were 1.18 and 1.25 mM, respectivel.
actosidase was purified from a fresh fruiting body of Ganoderma lucidum by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and column chromatographies with DEAE-Sephadex and Con A-Sepharose. The purified enzyme was homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its N-terminal amino acid sequence was similar to that of Mortierella vinacea alpha-galactosidase. The molecular mass of the enzyme was about 56 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and about 249 kDa by gel filtration column chromatography. The optimum pH and temperature were 6.0 and 70 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was fully stable to heating at 70 degrees C for 30 min. It hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (Km=0.4 mM) but hydrolyzed little o-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside. It also hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. The enzyme catalyzed the transgalactosylation reaction which synthesized melibiose. The product was confirmed by various analyse.
ukocytes are thought to express alpha2-3-sialylated and alpha1-3-fucosylated selectin ligands such as sialyl Lewis x (sLe(x)), although monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to sLe(x) or Le(x) reportedly do not bind to murine leukocytes. We observed that P- and E-selectin bound to pronase-sensitive ligands on murine monocytic WEHI-3 cells and murine neutrophils, indicating that the ligands for both selectins are glycoproteins. CSLEX-1, HECA-452, and other widely used mAbs to sLe(x) and Le(x) did not bind to WEHI-3 cells and bound at very low levels to murine neutrophils. Only the anti-sLe(x) mAbs 2H5 and KM93, which also recognize nonfucosylated glycans, bound to WEHI-3 cells. 2H5 and KM93 bound to pronase-resistant structures, indicating that the mAbs did not identify selectin ligands. Treatment of WEHI-3 cells with glycosidases or chlorate demonstrated that sialic acid modifications, alpha1-3-galactosylation, or sulfation did not mask epitopes for mAbs to sLe(x) or Le(x). Compared to human promyelocytic HL-60 cells, WEHI-3 cells and murine neutrophils expressed low alpha1-3-fucosyltransferase activities. Consistent with very low endogenous fucosylation, forced fucosylation of intact WEHI-3 cells or murine neutrophils by exogenous alpha1-3-fucosyltransferase FTVI and GDP-fucose created many new epitopes for anti-sLe(x) mAbs such as HECA-452 and CSLEX-1. Nevertheless, forced fucosylation of intact cells did not significantly augment their ability to bind to fluid-phase P- or E-selectin or to roll on immobilized P- or E-selectin under flow. These data suggest that murine myeloid leukocytes fucosylate only a few specific glycans, which interact preferentially with P- and E-selecti.
minoglycan-associated antigen is associated with a carbohydrate moiety of all three zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins of pig and rabbit but is absent in the mouse and rat. A monoclonal antibody (PS1) recognizing this determinant was obtained by immunizing mice with a porcine ZP glycoprotein isoform purified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Conditions known to remove O-linked or sialic acid carbohydrate moieties (alkaline reduction; O-glycanase or neuraminidase enzymatic cleavage) did not remove the carbohydrate epitope. However, treatment with endo-beta-glycosidase, endoglycosidase F, or combinations of neuraminidase plus beta-galactosidase, totally removed the determinant, indicating that it is associated with a poly-N-acetyllactosaminoglycan structure present on an N-linked oligosaccharide. Molecular morphology studies using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy techniques demonstrate that the PS1 antigen is localized at the surface of the ZP. Confirmation of this localization was obtained through studies that show that this antibody will inhibit homologous sperm binding to the pig ZP. Additional analyses using modular contrast microscopy and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that this carbohydrate-associated antigen is localized in discrete layers throughout the ZP matrix. These studies are the first to demonstrate the presence of a lactosaminoglycan type carbohydrate moiety in all three ZP proteins using a monoclonal antibody that appears to be involved in sperm recognition and structural organizatio.
that commercially available sialidases prepared from Clostridium perfringens ATCC10543 were contaminated with an endoglycosidase capable of releasing the disaccharide GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal from glycans expressed in the gastric gland mucous cell-type mucin. We have isolated this enzyme in electrophoretically homogeneous form from the culture supernatant of this organism by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 HR column. The enzyme was specifically retained by and eluted from the column with methyl-alpha-Glc. By NMR spectroscopy, the structure of the disaccharide released from porcine gastric mucin by this enzyme was established to be GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal. The specificity of this enzyme as an endo-beta-galactosidase was established by analyzing the liberation of GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal from GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Galbeta1--&gt;4GlcNAcbeta1--&gt;6(GlcNAcalpha1--&gt; 4Galbeta1--&gt;3)GalNAc-ol by mass spectrometry. Because this novel endo-beta-galactosidase specifically releases the GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal moiety from porcine gastric mucin, we propose to call this enzyme a GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal-releasing endo-beta-galactosidase (Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa)). Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) was found to remove the GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal epitope expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma AGS cells transfected with alpha1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase cDNA. Endo-beta-Gal(GnGa) should become useful for studying the structure and function of glycoconjugates containing the terminal GlcNAcalpha1--&gt;4Gal epitop.
l adhesin was identified from an enteroaggregative Escherichia coli strain. The adhesin was purified to 740-fold by sequential chromatography on an affinity matrix and gel filtration column in the FPLC system. The homogeneity of the purified protein was established by analytical isoelectrofocussing (pI 7.25). The native adhesin appeared as a high-molecular-weight aggregative protein as revealed by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12HR10/30 column. However, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the molecular weight of the adhesin was found to be 18 kDa and this was further confirmed by gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6HR 10/30 column presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The N-terminal 15-amino-acid sequence of the adhesin did not show homology with any of the previously reported fimbrial adhesins. The purified adhesin showed adhesion to human erythrocytes in the presence of Ca(2+) (5 mM). The optimum temperature and pH for the hemadhesion activity was found to be 25 degrees C and 6.5, respectively. The inhibition study clearly suggested that the binding site of the adhesin could recognize galactose as the specific sugar. The fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside was quenched on binding to the adhesin and maximum reversal of fluorescence quenching was observed by competitive substitution titration with raffinose. The adhesin was found to contain one binding site per monomer for its specific sugar residue. The association constant and the free energy of binding were obtained as 3.98 x 10(5) M(-1) and -31.97 kJ/mol, respectively. The adherence of the bacteria to HEp-2 monolayer was inhibited in presence of galactose and this was further supported by a significant reduction in the bacterial adherence to the HEp-2 cells, pretreated with beta-D-galactosidas.
ine enzymatic activities of the 8 key glycosaminoglycan-degrading glycosidases and glycoside sulfatases in cultured human articular chondrocytes and in synovial fluid from patients with osteoarthriti.
wing enzymes were analyzed: hexosaminidase and its isoenzyme A, N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, alpha-L-iduronidase, aryl sulfatase, and galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase. Activity of the selected enzymes was analyzed by fluorometry with the aid of 4-methylumbelliferryl derivatives of the appropriate monosaccharide.
idase was found to be the dominant enzyme released by chondrocytes into the extracellular compartment. Stimulation of chondrocytes with interleukin-1beta resulted in a selective increase of the extracellular hexosaminidase activity and, to a lesser degree, of the extracellular beta-galactosidase activity, without significant changes in the activity of the other studied enzymes. Analysis of the pH dependency of the enzymatic activities revealed that even at neutral pH, hexosaminidase expressed a measurable activity, much higher than the activity of the other studied enzymes. Chondrocyte apoptosis did not result in increased extracellular glycosidase activities, including hexosaminidase activity. The spectrum of glycosidase and glycoside sulfatase activities in the synovial fluid from patients with osteoarthritis was similar to that in cultured human articular chondrocyte.
a support the concept that lysosomal glycosidases, in particular hexosaminidase, represent a distinct subset of cartilage matrix-degrading enzymes that are activated by proinflammatory stimul.
several proteoglycans (PGs) have been reported in bovine periodontal ligament (PDL), the composition of PGs in PDL has been poorly characterized. In the present study, we isolated and characterized keratan sulfate-substituted PG (fibromodulin) in bovine PDL. Fibromodulin was purified from 4 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) extracts of bovine PDL tissues using DEAE Sephacel ion-exchange chromatography and preparative electrophoresis. Fibromodulin appeared as a single polydisperse band with an apparent molecular weight (MW) of 80,000 (80 kDa) on SDS-PAGE. Digestion of fibromodulin with keratanase or neuraminidase reduced the apparent molecular size, and N-glycanase treatment produced core protein bands of around 40 kDa. Fibromodulin reacted with keratan sulfate monoclonal antibody (5D4) and fibromodulin polyclonal antibodies (alpha-FM). The keratanase-digested fibromodulin reacted with alpha-FM, but not with 5D4. These data suggest that fibromodulin is one of the small PGs in the PDL-matrix and may fulfill construction and maintenance functions in this tissu.
reviously shown that chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) catalyzes transfer of sulfate not only to position 6 of GalNAc residue of chondroitin but also to position 6 of Gal residue of keratan sulfate. In this study, we examined the sulfation of sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharides by C6ST. C6ST catalyzed transfer of sulfate to NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc (SLN), NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc (SL1L1), NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(6-sulfo)GlcNAc beta 1-3(6-sulfo)Gal beta 1-4(6-sulfo)GlcNAc (SL2L4), and their desialylated derivatives, but not to NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc (SLe(x)). The sulfated product formed from SLN was degraded with neuraminidase and reduced with NaBH4. The resulting sulfated disaccharide alditol showed the same retention time in SAX-HPLC as that of [3H]Gal(6SO4) beta 1-4GlcNAc-ol. The sulfated product formed from SLN was also degraded by a reaction sequence of neuraminidase digestion, hydrazinolysis, deamination, and NaBH4 reduction. The final product was coeluted with [3H]Gal(6SO4) beta 1-4anhydromannitol in SAX-HPLC. These observations show that C6ST could transfer sulfate to position 6 of Gal residue of SLN. Incorporation of sulfate into SL2L4 was much higher than the incorporation into SL1L1, suggesting that sulfate moiety attached to adjacent GlcNAc residue may stimulate the transfer of sulfate to Gal residue. The recombinant C6ST also catalyzed sulfation of the sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharides, indicating that a single protein catalyzes sulfation of chondroitin, keratan sulfate, and sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharides. These results raised a possibility that C6ST may be one of the candidates involved in the biosynthesis of sulfated sialyl Lewis x ligand for L-selecti.
equisite to the study of the fine chemical structure of the branched region of pectin, an exo-beta-(1,4)-galactanase was purified from a commercial preparation (Pectinex AR). Purification was carried out by precipitation with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate, preparative electrofocusing, anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on cross-linked alginate. Exogalactanase specific activity was 992 nkat mg-1 and the enzyme was devoid of beta-(1,3)- or beta-(1,6)-galactanase, arabinanase, beta-D-galactosidase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidade activities. Residual exopolygalacturonase activity represented 2.9% of the galactanase activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing showed two close bands with molecular weights of 120,000 and 90,000 and pHi of 3.8 and 4.1, respectively. The enzyme acted in an exo manner and its activity was optimum at pH 3.5 and 60 degrees C. When incubated with galacto-oligosaccharides, new oligosaccharides with a higher degree of polymerization appeared, indicating the ability of the enzyme to transfer galactose residue.
ulfate (KS) chains prepared from both bovine tracheal rings and bovine femoral head cartilage were digested with the enzyme keratanase from Pseudomonas species; large repeat-sequence and non-reducing terminal oligosaccharides were fractionated and purified using high-performance ion-exchange chromatography. The main beta-linked pentasulfated hexasaccharide repeat segment, [R6], GlcNAc(6S)1-1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S)1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S)1-3Gal-ol and the asialo beta-linked capping pentasulfated heptasaccharide, [C7], Gal1-4GlcNAc(6S)1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S)1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S) 1-3Gal-ol have been completely characterized by high-field NMR spectroscopy using one- and two-dimensional methods. Partial 1H assignments are summarized for three homologous series of higher oligosaccharides: GlcNAc(6S)[1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S)]2-5(1-3)Gal-0l [R8,R10,R12] Gal1-4GlcNAc(6S)[1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S)]3-5(1-3)Gal-ol [C9,C11,C13] NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc(6S)[1-3Gal(6S)1-4GlcNAc(6S)]2-4(1-3)Gal-ol [C8,C10,C12] obtained from keratan sulfate by keratanase cleavage. The first shows that the unsulfated galactose residues within the repeat sequence region of KS may be separated by fully sulfated segments which have a wide distribution of lengths. The others, viz. those with sialylated caps, and the related galactose capped asialo-segments (derived from a KS digestion in which the keratanase also exhibited sialidase activity) represent an homologous series of epitopes in which the first internal unsulfated galactose is located at a position which may be up to five or more fully sulfated N-acetyllactosamine disaccharide repeat units along from the non-reducing terminus of the KS polyme.
ture of the repeat region and chain caps of the N-linked keratan sulphate chains attached to bovine tracheal cartilage fibromodulin has been examined. The chains were fragmented by keratanase digestion, the resultant oligosaccharides isolated by strong anion-exchange chromatography, and their structures determined using high-field 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. The chains were found to possess the following general structure: [formula: see text] All of the capping oligosaccharides isolated terminate with alpha(2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. No alpha(2-6)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid chain terminators, nor any fucose, alpha (1-3)-linked to N-acetylglucosamine along the repeat region, were detected. This work demonstrates that the structure of the repeat region and chain caps of N-linked keratan sulphate attached to fibromodulin isolated from bovine tracheal cartilage is identical with that of O-linked keratan sulphate chains attached to aggrecan derived from non-articular cartilag.
cterization and properties of a beta-galactanase and alpha- and beta-galactosidases as well as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate degrading enzymes which appear during the 15 days of the embryonic development of the mollusc Pomacea sp. is reported. The beta-galactanase, which appears around day 7 of development, was separated from alpha- and beta-galactosidase which emerge at day 1 and 4 after oviposition, respectively. The galactanase seems to be responsible for the degradation of an acidic beta-galactan (which is also synthesized by the eggs around day 5) to galactose and di- and tri-galactosides. Heparan sulfate appears around day 10 of development together with a heparan sulfate endoglucuronidase responsible for the degradation of its N-acetylated region. An alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase and a beta-glucuronidase which act upon the N-acetylated fragments formed from heparan sulfate emerge around day 4 of development. Chondroitin sulfate and a chondroitin sulfate sulfatase emerge around day 9 of development whereas a beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and the beta beta-galactan, heparan and chondroitin sulfate, respectively. The possible role of these elements in the migration of mesenchymal cells, in the processes of cell-cell recognition and control of cell growth is discusse.
ng of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin to caseins, whey proteins, milk fat globule membrane, and proteose-peptone fraction from bovine milk was studied by using the Western blot technique. Two toxin-binding glycoproteins, pp16k and pp20k, with molecular weights of 15,500 and 20,000, respectively, were detected only in a proteose-peptone fraction. These glycoproteins were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Toyopearl HW 55 gel filtration chromatography. The binding ability to the toxin was destroyed by periodate treatment or beta-galactosidase treatment, indicating that a carbohydrate moiety, particularly a terminal galactosyl residue, was essential for the binding of the toxin. In contrast, the binding ability was not changed by mild acid treatment, and these glycoproteins did not bind cholera toxin, which can bind to ganglioside GM1, suggesting that the carbohydrate structure of the glycoproteins is different from that of GM1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and immunoblot analysis indicated that the protein moieties of pp16k and pp20k are identical to alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin, respectively. These toxin-binding glycoproteins were not detected in whey proteins isolated from unheated skim milk, suggesting that they are newly generated during heat treatment of skim milk before the preparation of a proteose-peptone fractio.
hosphate amperometric nanobiosensor, based on an intimate integration of pyruvate oxidase (PyOx) and its cofactors, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), with a highly ordered gold nanowires array (AuNWA) has been developed. The successful integration of PyOx and the co-factors, via crosslinking with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glutaraldehyde (GLA), onto the AuNWA was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The resulting nanobiosensor achieved a detection limit of 0.1 µM, a linear concentration range of 12.5-1000 µM, and a sensitivity of 140.3 µA mM(-1)cm(-2). Notably, the incorporation of the AuNWA reduced the required PyOx concentration by 70-120 fold and the presence of common interferants, such as chloride, sulfate, fluoride, nitrite and nitrate ions did not interfere with phosphate detection. Furthermore, the nanobiosensor demonstrated a very high stability with repeated use over two weeks and was successfully used for the determination of phosphate in water samples with an average recovery of 96.6 ± 4.9.
genesis of vascular calcifications in uremia is not completely understood, but is regarded as multifactorial, involving traditional and nontraditional risk factors. In particular, derangements in divalent ions are considered of outmost importance, but also the role of physiologic inhibitors of calcification is now claimed. The most powerful physiologic inhibitor of calcification is pyrophosphate, but its biochemical instability precludes its clinical use to date. The pharmacologic analogs of pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates, cannot be easily tested for this purpose in renal patients, given their renal clearance. The list of proteins involved in calcification is a growing one, and experimental models point to the potential clinical relevance of matrix Gla protein, fetuin, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin and bone morphogenetic protein-7. Induction of metabolic acidosis, although theoretically useful, is not recommended, while administration of sodium thiosulphate could be beneficial, but its safety awaits confirmation. Actually, the only available therapies for vascular calcifications are those directed toward achievement of the biochemical targets for calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone with the hope, but not the certainty, that this will be efficacious. However, to this purpose, selection of the most appropriate strategy in the individual patient seems essentia.
noviruses from multiple species bind to coagulation factor X (FX), yet the importance of this interaction in adenovirus dissemination is unknown. Upon contact with blood, vectors based on adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) binds to FX via the hexon protein with nanomolar affinity, leading to selective uptake of the complex into the liver and spleen. The Ad5:FX complex putatively targets heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). The aim of this study was to elucidate the specific requirements for Ad5:FX-mediated cellular uptake in this high-affinity pathway, specifically the HSPG receptor requirements as well as the role of penton base-mediated integrin engagement in subsequent internalisation. Removal of HS sidechains by enzymatic digestion or competition with highly-sulfated heparins/heparan sulfates significantly decreased FX-mediated Ad5 cell binding in vitro and ex vivo. Removal of N-linked and, in particular, O-linked sulfate groups significantly attenuated the inhibitory capabilities of heparin, while the chemical inhibition of endogenous HSPG sulfation dose-dependently reduced FX-mediated Ad5 cellular uptake. Unlike native heparin, modified heparins lacking O- or N-linked sulfate groups were unable to inhibit Ad5 accumulation in the liver 1h after intravascular administration of adenovirus. Similar results were observed in vitro using Ad5 vectors possessing mutations ablating CAR- and/or α(v) integrin binding, demonstrating that attachment of the Ad5:FX complex to the cell surface involves HSPG sulfation. Interestingly, Ad5 vectors ablated for α(v) integrin binding showed markedly delayed cell entry, highlighting the need for an efficient post-attachment internalisation signal for optimal Ad5 uptake and transport following surface binding mediated through FX. This study therefore integrates the established model of α(v) integrin-dependent adenoviral infection with the high-affinity FX-mediated pathway. This has important implications for mechanisms that define organ targeting following contact of human adenoviruses with bloo.
axis/calcific uremic arteriolopathy is rare but an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease with increasing prevalence. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) has rapidly emerged from a seldom used therapy for the treatment of calciphylaxis/calcific uremic arteriolopathy to a treatment that is being increasingly utilized globally due to multiple positive outcomes shared in the form of case reports and reviews during the past 6 years. Its role as a rather potent antioxidant has uniquely been associated with a prompt decrease in pain and its slower chelating properties are associated with regression of subcutaneous calcifications. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate nuclear transcription factor, NF(kappa)B and downstream cytokines resulting in inflammation, which may result in dysregulated hepatic protein synthesis. Indeed, inflammation activates acute-phase reactant synthesis, while concurrently inhibiting synthesis of fetuin-A (an inhibitor of extraosseous calcification) and the antioxidant albumin. Additionally, ROS may decrease locally synthesized matrix GLA proteins and this combination may contribute to increased vascular and subcutaneous calcification. STS used alone or in combination with other novel emerging therapies may result in the improved clinical outcomes in this challenging clinical conditio.
y investigates the potentiometric properties of several strains of Shewanella spp. and determines whether these properties can be correlated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) type. The LPS of eight Shewanella strains was characterized using silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and their potentiometric properties determined using high-resolution acid-base titrations. Titrations showed that total ligand concentrations (L(T)) ranged from 0.903 +/- 0.007 micromol/mg (S. baltica 63) to 1.387 +/- 0.007 micromol/mg (S. amazonensis SB2B). Smooth strains (possessing O-side chains) exhibited higher mean L(T) values than rough strains (no O-side chain). A Tukey's honestly significantly different (HSD) test revealed, smooth strains exhibited significantly higher L(T) values than rough strains in 69% of comparisons. Comparison of individual pK(a) concentrations revealed that smooth LPS strains of Shewanella were relatively enriched in reactive groups at pK(a) 5, suggesting their LPS O-side chains contained detectable carboxyl groups. Combined pKa spectra from all eight Shewanella strains produced a common trend indicating that the way in which the surface proton-buffering capacity changes with pH is similar for the species studied her.
ritis (OA) is a slowly progressing chronic joint disease. Glucosamine (GlcN) is a saccharide that is widely used to relieve symptoms associated with OA. However, the mechanism of the effects of GlcN on articular cartilage remains unclear. We studied the effects of GlcN and its analogues, including chitin derivatives included in health supplements containing GlcN, on a chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5. We examined the effects of these saccharides on the proliferation and differentiation of ATDC5 cells. Glucosamine analogues, such as N-acetyl glucosamine and chitobiose, did not affect the proliferation or differentiation of ATDC5 cells. While GlcN did not affect the proliferation of ATDC5 cells, it inhibited their differentiation. Next, we examined whether GlcN affects mineralization and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production by ATDC5 cells. Mineralization was markedly inhibited by addition of GlcN to the cell culture medium. Moreover, GlcN induced the formation of sulfated GAG in ATDC5. We also analyzed the mRNA levels in ATDC5 cells. GlcN reduced the mRNA levels of Smad2, Smad4 and MGP. GlcN might inhibit expression of MGP mRNA and induce the production of chondroitin sulfate in ATDC5 cells. The mechanism by which GlcN inhibits mineralization may be by regulating the expression of mRNA for the Smad2 and Smad4 chondrogenic master gene.
a protein (MGP) is an inhibitor of mineralization found in bone, cartilage, developing tissues, smooth muscle, and atherosclerotic plaques. MGP interaction with hydroxyapatite (HA) has been inferred by its function, but has never been measured directly. In this study, the influence of MGP antibody (x-MGP) binding, plasmin digestion, and various ions, including calcium and phosphate, on (125)I-labeled MGP-HA binding was examined. Nonlinear regression analysis of MGP binding yielded K(a) (association constant; approximately 8.0 x 10(4) M(-1)) and B(max) (maximum specific bound fraction of MGP; approximately 0.53). Anti-MGP antiserum reduced K(a) to less than half of control (0.33% x-MGP). Plasmin-digested MGP decreased HA binding parameters by almost a third, showing that protein binding and limited proteolysis greatly affected HA binding. The presence of free calcium ions significantly increased binding in a dose-dependent manner, with approximately 1 mmol/L calcium increasing K(a) by a factor of 2. Phosphate ions decreased binding significantly in a dose-dependent fashion, with approximately 1 mmol/L PO(4) decreasing K(a) by a third. Magnesium at approximately 1 mmol/L decreased K(a) significantly by half, but the effect was not dose-dependent. Carbonate, sulfate, and sodium ions had no significant effect on binding. MGP binding to HA is sensitive to protein binding, limited proteolysis, and the surrounding ionic environmen.
umours exhibit glycosaminoglycan rich, and in particular hyaluronan rich matrices surrounding them that facilitate tumour growth and invasion. In many tumours, this matrix is predominantly synthesized by fibroblasts following stimulation by tumour cell-derived factor.
ine what effect tumour cell-conditioned medium has upon fibroblast glycosaminoglycan synthesis when cells were cultured as monolayers and within contracted collagen lattice.
e conditioned medium from melanoma cell lines (C8161, MV3, A375 and Hs294T) was examined for its ability to stimulate the incorporation of 3H-glucosamine and 35SO4 into glycosaminoglycans synthesized by fibroblast.
ed medium from all four melanoma cell lines exhibited potent glycosaminoglycan-stimulating activity. In monolayer culture, C8161-conditioned medium stimulated a 4.2-fold increase in fibroblast hyaluronan, and a 9.9-fold increase in sulphated glycosaminoglycan synthesis, while 35SO4 incorporation was increased only 2.1-fold. In collagen lattice cultures, C8161-conditioned medium stimulated a 4.9-fold increase in hyaluronan synthesis, a 5.4-fold increase in sulphated glycosaminoglycans, and a 1.3-fold increase in 35SO4 incorporatio.
cells produce factors that are potent stimulators of fibroblast glycosaminoglycan synthesis, in both monolayer culture and within contracted collagen lattices. Synthesis of both hyaluronan and sulphated glycosaminoglycans with a reduced degree of polymer sulphation is stimulated. Such changes are likely to promote tumour cell proliferation and migratio.
cin inhibits the growth of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in the mammalian kidney. Isoforms A and B contain three equivalents of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues implicated in Ca2+-binding and exhibit strong inhibitor properties and high Ca2+-binding affinity (Kd approximately 10(-8) M). Isoforms C and D lack these properties and exhibit low Ca2+-binding affinity (Kd approximately 10(-6) M). With VO2+ as a structural probe, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of the Ca2+-binding sites of isoforms B and D showed that VO2+ binds competitively with a metal ion:protein stoichiometry of 4:1. EPR spectral parameters of the VO2+ ion were consistent with only equatorial oxygen-donor ligands. EPR and angle-selected electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectra showed two equatorially positioned, metal coordinating waters in isoform D while in isoform B no ligands undergoing hydrogen exchange were found. Since isoform D showed no evidence for axially coordinated water, similarly to isoform B, it is likely that the protein residues occupying the axial sites are identical in both proteins. ENDOR spectra of VO2+-complexes of isoforms B and D were compared to spectra of the VO2+-complex with alpha-ethylmalonic acid (EMA), a molecular mimic of Gla. Spectra of the VO2+-complex of EMA showed axial water located trans to the V=O bond and outer shell water hydrogen-bonded to the vanadyl oxygen, consistent with the X-ray structure of Ca(EMA)2. We, therefore, conclude that the spatial disposition of carboxylate groups of Gla residues coordinating Ca2+ in isoforms A and B must differ from that observed in the crystal structure of Ca(EMA).
ts of total sunlight deprivation on urinary risk factors for nephrolithiasis and vitamin D metabolism were studied in 20 healthy male subjects. Blood and 24-h urine samples were collected before submarine deployment and 68 days later while still at sea. No subject received sunlight exposure during the test interval. Significant decreases in daily urinary excretion of calcium, uric acid, sodium, sulfate, and phosphorus were found. The relative supersaturation ratio of monosodium urate also fell. There was no change in urinary citrate or urine volume. Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] declined from 31 to 19 pg/ml (P &lt; 0.0001), parathyroid hormone increased from 22 to 30 pg/ml (P &lt; 0.0001), and osteocalcin (GLA) increased from 2.7 to 3.3 ng/ml (P = 0.005). Mean serum levels of 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D were unchanged. Four subjects had 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml by the end of the submarine patrol. These findings suggest that exposure to the submarine environment produces physiologic changes that decrease the risk for renal stone formation. The data are consistent with the role of vitamin D metabolism in sunlight deprivation and demonstrate that compensatory mechanisms are well established within 68 day.
dulin (TM) is an anionic (pI approximately 4) protein cofactor that promotes thrombin (THR) cleavage of protein C to generate activated protein C (APC), a potent anticoagulant. We find that the cationic platelet alpha-granule protein platelet factor 4 (PF4) stimulates 4-25-fold the cofactor activity of rabbit TM and two differentially glycanated versions of an extracellular domain human TM polypeptide in which the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) is either present (GAG+ TM) or absent (GAG- TM) with an ED50 of 3.3-10 micrograms/ml. No such stimulation occurs in response to beta-thromboglobulin or thrombospondin, or when protein C lacking its gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain is the substrate. Heparin and chondroitin sulfates A and E reverse PF4 stimulation. PF4 minimally affects the Kd for THR but decreases 30-fold (from 8.3 to 0.3 microM) the Km for protein C of APC generation by GAG+ TM. PF4 also strikingly transforms the [Ca2+] dependence profile of rabbit and GAG+ TM to resemble that of GAG- TM. A potential explanation for this is that PF4, like Ca2+, induces heparin-reversible alterations in native (but not Gla-domainless) protein C conformation as assessed by autofluorescence emission analysis. We conclude that PF4 stimulates TM APC generation by interacting electrostatically with both the TM GAG and the protein C Gla domain to enhance markedly the affinity of the THR.TM complex for protein C. By this mechanism, PF4 may play a previously unsuspected role in the physiologic regulation of clottin.
rticle we describe the isolation of a 4-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing protein from calcified human atherosclerotic plaques. The protein was extracted from pulverized calcified plaques by demineralization with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and was subsequently purified by anion-exchange fast protein and high-performance liquid chromatography by using ion-exchange and gel-filtration columns. The protein was designated as plaque Gla protein (PGP) and has an apparent mass of 23 kD as estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis. By determining the sequence of its first six amino acid residues, the protein was unequivocally demonstrated to be not related to any other known protein. Moreover, no immunological relationship (as tested by Western blot analysis) was found between PGP and other known Gla-containing protein.
ed protein C from a barium citrate-adsorbed fresh plasma and human factor IX concentrate by immunoaffinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose coupled with monoclonal antibodies to protein C. The antibodies used were conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies to the calcium-induced structure of protein C. Protein C was bound to antibodies coupled with Sepharose in the presence of calcium ions and was eluted with EDTA. This immunopurification resulted in a 13,000-fold purification of the fully functional zymogen from plasma. The immunoaffinity-isolated protein C was found to have higher amounts of single-chain protein C than conventionally isolated protein C when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reduced conditions. The factor IX concentrate was applied to this Ca2+-dependent antibody JTC-3-immobilized Sepharose in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2, and protein C with its gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain intact was firstly bound to this column and then eluted by metal chelation with EDTA. When flow-through fractions were applied again in the presence of Ca2+ to this column, modified protein C which had lost its N-terminal 42-residue peptide was weakly bound to this column. It was eluted in the absence of Ca2+. However, only a low percentage of modified protein C was detectable by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody JTC-3 and peroxidase-labeled immunopurified polyclonal antibody. These results indicate that factor IX concentrate has both Gla-domain-intact and Gla-domainless protein C. Moreover, it suggests that Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody JTC-3 may recognize the coupled conformational change of protein C induced by the combined effect of Ca2+ binding to the Gla domain and to other parts of protein .
 was purified from human plasma by a four-step procedure which included barium citrate adsorption, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and blue agarose chromatography with a yield of 20%. It is a 62,000 mol wt protein with an extinction coefficient of 12.0. The concentration of Protein Z in pooled, citrated plasma is 2.2 micrograms/ml and its half-life in patients starting warfarin anticoagulation therapy is estimated to be less than 2.5 d. The NH2-terminal sequence is Ala-Gly-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Leu-(Gla)-(Gla)-Leu-Phe-(Gla)-Gly-Asn-Leu. Neither Protein Z nor its cleavage products, which were obtained by treatment of Protein Z with thrombin or plasmin, incorporated [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The physiological function of Protein Z remains unknow.
gulation Factor VII was purified 100,000-fold from fresh frozen human plasma to apparent homogeneity with a yield of 30% based on coagulation assay. The molecular weight estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 48,000. Factor VII is composed of a single polypeptide chain with the NH2-terminal sequence Ala-Asn-Ala-Phe-Leu-(Gla)-(Gla)-Leu-(Arg)-Pro. It is converted to a two-chain form (Factor VIIa) connected by disulfide bonds by the action of Factor Xa, in the presence of phospholipids and calcium, and by Factor XIIa without additional cofactors. This conversion is associated with a 20- to 25-fold increase in coagulation assay activity. Factors VII and VIIa were inhibited by 15 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate with 50% inactivation in 160 and 60 min, respectively. The presence of tissue factor and CaCl2 accelerated the inactivation by approximated 5-fold. Neither Factor VII nor VIIa were inhibited by antithrombin III in the absence of heparin. However, with the addition of heparin, Factor VIIa was inhibited at a rate approximately 25 times that of Factor VI.
omal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2/SCARB2) has been described as a mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-independent trafficking receptor for β-glucocerebrosidase (GC). Recently, a putative M6P residue in a crystal structure of a recombinantly expressed LIMP-2 ectodomain has been reported. Based on surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence lifetime imaging analyses, it was suggested that the interaction of soluble LIMP-2 with the cation-independent M6P receptor (MPR) results in M6P-dependent targeting of LIMP-2 to lysosomes. As the physiological relevance of this observation was not addressed, we investigated M6P-dependent delivery of LIMP-2 to lysosomes in murine liver and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We demonstrate that LIMP-2 and GC reach lysosomes independent of the M6P pathway. In fibroblasts lacking either MPRs or the M6P-forming N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-1-phosphotransferase, LIMP-2 still localizes to lysosomes. Immunoblot analyses also revealed comparable LIMP-2 levels within lysosomes purified from liver of wild-type (wt) and GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-defective mice. Heterologous expression of the luminal domain of LIMP-2 in wild-type, LIMP-2-deficient and GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase-defective cells further established that the M6P modification is dispensable for lysosomal sorting of LIMP-2. Finally, cathepsin Z, a known GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase substrate, but not LIMP-2, could be precipitated with M6P-specific antibodies. These data prove M6P-independent lysosomal sorting of LIMP-2 and subsequently GC in viv.
icoids exert their function by regulating glucocorticoid-responsive genes through interaction with glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha), a nuclear receptor. Glucocorticoids also affect bone metabolism; this is evidenced by the fact that GRalpha is expressed in several kinds of cells in bone tissue, including osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, mononuclear cells in bone marrow, and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Glucocorticoids are known to induce osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation. However, this effect of glucocorticoids on bone tissue is still controversial since long-term use of glucocorticoids results in osteoporosis in vivo. To identify glucocorticoid-regulated genes in human osteoblastic cells, SaOS2 cells were treated with dexamethasone (10(-8) M) for 6 hours, and were then subjected to microarray analysis. Genes such as C/EBPdelta, DUSP1, Per1 and TRIM63 were found to be induced by dexamethasone. The induction of mRNAs of these genes by dexamethasone (10(-8) M, 10(-7) M, and 10(-6) M) was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TRIM63, also called muscle-specific ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1), was reported to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase expressed mainly in muscular tissue. SaOS2 cells overexpressing exogenous TRIM63 showed increased expression of an osteoblastic differentiation marker gene, alkaline phosphatase, with reduced proliferation. These results suggest that TRIM63 is a candidate for genes mediating the glucocorticoid-induced promotion of osteoblastic differentiatio.
with advanced chronic heart failure (CHF) are characterized by progressive muscle wasting. The two E3-ligases Rnf28 and Atrogin-1 controlling the activation of the ubiquitinproteasome system might be of importance for the regulation of muscle size. Given the convincing effect of regular physical exercise training (ET) in CHF, it was the aim of the present trial to elucidate, whether ET affects both mentioned enzymes in CHF and whether this is associated with an increase in skeletal muscle mas.
ts with severe CHF were randomized to 12 weeks of ET or sedentary lifestyle (control). The expression of Rnf28 and Atrogin-1 in the skeletal muscle was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Skeletal muscle cross sectional area (CSA) was measured by computed tomograph.
tients ET led to a significant reduction in skeletal muscle mRNA transcription (from 14.3 ± 2.0 to 8.7 ± 1.4 arbitrary units; p&lt;0.05 versus baseline and versus control for the change) and protein expression of Rnf28 (from 4.70 ± 1.35 to 2.84 ± 0.65 arbitrary units; p&lt;0.05 versus baseline and versus control for the change). This was accompanied by a significant increase in total muscle CSA of both thighs (from 139.9 ± 5.2 to 149.2 ± 5.9 cm(2); p&lt;0.05 versus baseline and versus control for the change). On the contrary, Atrogin-1 was not affecte.
ts with advanced CHF, regular physical exercise training led to a decrease in Rnf28 expression in the skeletal muscle. This was linked to an increase in skeletal muscle cross sectional area, supporting the notion that ET has anti-catabolic properties in CH.
ggregate myopathies (PAMs) define muscle disorders characterized by protein accumulation in muscle fibres. We describe a new PAM in a patient with proximal muscle weakness and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whose muscle fibres contained inclusions containing myosin and myosin-associated proteins, and aberrant distribution of microtubules. These lesions appear as intact A- and M-bands lacking thin filaments and Z-discs. These features differ from inclusions in myosin storage myopathy (MSM), but are highly similar to those in mice deficient for the muscle-specific RING finger proteins MuRF1 and MuRF3. Sanger sequencing excluded mutations in the MSM-associated gene MYH7 but identified mutations in TRIM63 and TRIM54, encoding MuRF1 and MuRF3, respectively. No mutations in other potentially disease-causing genes were identified by Sanger and whole exome sequencing. Analysis of seven family members revealed that both mutations segregated in the family but only the homozygous TRIM63 null mutation in combination with the heterozygous TRIM54 mutation found in the proband caused the disease phenotype. Both MuRFs are microtubule-associated proteins localizing to sarcomeric M-bands and Z-discs. They are E3 ubiquitin ligases that play a role in degradation of sarcomeric proteins, stabilization of microtubules and myogenesis. Lack of ubiquitin and the 20S proteasome subunit in the inclusions found in the patient suggested impaired turnover of thick filament proteins. Disruption of microtubules in cultured myotubes was rescued by transient expression of wild-type MuRF1. The unique features of this novel myopathy point to defects in homeostasis of A-band proteins in combination with instability of microtubules as cause of the diseas.
 and Mad-related protein) 2/3 are downstream signaling molecules for TGF-β and myostatin (Mstn). Recently, Mstn was shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skeletal muscle via canonical Smad3, nuclear factor-κB, and TNF-α pathway. However, mice lacking Smad3 display skeletal muscle atrophy due to increased Mstn levels. Hence, our aims were first to investigate whether Mstn induced muscle atrophy in Smad3(-/-) mice by increasing ROS and second to delineate Smad3-independent signaling mechanism for Mstn-induced ROS. Herein we show that Smad3(-/-) mice have increased ROS levels in skeletal muscle, and inactivation of Mstn in these mice partially ablates the oxidative stress. Furthermore, ROS induction by Mstn in Smad3(-/-) muscle was not via nuclear factor-κB (p65) signaling but due to activated p38, ERK MAPK signaling and enhanced IL-6 levels. Consequently, TNF-α, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, and xanthine oxidase levels were up-regulated, which led to an increase in ROS production in Smad3(-/-) skeletal muscle. The exaggerated ROS in the Smad3(-/-) muscle potentiated binding of C/EBP homology protein transcription factor to MuRF1 promoter, resulting in enhanced MuRF1 levels leading to muscle atroph.
nduces a loss of skeletal muscle mass and alters myogenesis in vitro, but whether it affects muscle regeneration in vivo following injury remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that hypoxia would impair the recovery of muscle mass during regeneration. To test this hypothesis, the soleus muscle of female rats was injured by notexin and allowed to recover for 3, 7, 14, and 28&nbsp;days under normoxia or hypobaric hypoxia (5,500&nbsp;m) conditions. Hypoxia impaired the formation and growth of new myofibers and enhanced the loss of muscle mass during the first 7&nbsp;days of regeneration, but did not affect the final recovery of muscle mass at 28&nbsp;days. The impaired regeneration under hypoxic conditions was associated with a blunted activation of mechanical target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as assessed by p70(S6K) and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation that was independent of Akt activation. The decrease in mTOR activity with hypoxia was consistent with the increase in AMP-activated protein kinase activity, but not related to the change in regulated in development and DNA response 1 protein content. Hypoxia increased the mRNA levels of the atrogene muscle ring finger-1 after 7&nbsp;days of regeneration, though muscle atrophy F box transcript levels remained unchanged. The increase in MyoD and myogenin mRNA expression with regeneration was attenuated at 7&nbsp;days with hypoxia. In conclusion, our results support the notion that the enhanced loss of muscle mass observed after 1&nbsp;week of regeneration under hypoxic conditions could mainly result from the impaired formation and growth of new fibers resulting from a reduction in protein synthesis and satellite cell activit.
ng finger-1 (MuRF1) is a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in the regulation of cardiac mass through its control of the ubiquitin proteasome system. While it has been suggested that MuRF1 is required for cardiac atrophy, a resting cardiac phenotype has not been reported in mice with a null deletion [knockout (KO)] of MuRF1. Here, we report that MuRF1 KO mice have significantly larger hearts than age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates at ≥ 6 mo of age and that loss of cardiac mass can occur in the absence of MuRF1. The objective of this study was to determine whether changes in proteasome activity were responsible for the cardiac phenotypes observed in MuRF1 KO mice. Cardiac function, architecture, and proteasome activity were analyzed at rest and following 28 days of dexamethasone (Dex) treatment in 6-mo-old WT and MuRF1 KO mice. Echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac function in the enlarged hearts in MURF1 KO mice. At rest, heart mass and cardiomyocyte diameter were significantly greater in MuRF1 KO than in WT mice. The increase in cardiac size in MuRF1 KO mice was related to a decrease in proteasome activity and an increase in Akt signaling relative to WT mice. Dex treatment induced a significant loss of cardiac mass in MuRF1 KO, but not WT, mice. Furthermore, Dex treatment resulted in an increase in proteasome activity in KO, but a decrease in WT, mice. In contrast, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling decreased in MuRF1 KO mice and increased in WT mice in response to Dex treatment. These findings demonstrate that MuRF1 plays an important role in regulating cardiac size through alterations in protein turnover and that MuRF1 is not required to induce cardiac atroph.
-proteasomal proteolytic pathway is one of the key signaling pathways determining protein degradation in muscle fibers. Among the E3 ubiquitin ligases, rate limiting enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, the most interesting ones are the MuRF isoforms: MuRF-1 and MuRF-2. There are some pieces of evidence that these enzymes are also involved in the regulation of gene expression in skeletal muscle under some specific conditions (i. e. muscle disuse). We supposed that it was disuse that brought about to altered localization of MuRFs in postural muscle fibers and their translocation to nuclei. In the study using the conventional simulation model of the gravitational unloading (rat hindlimb suspension according to Ilyin and Novikov modified by Morey-Holton) we found that from the 3rd day till 14th day of unloading the content of MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 in the nuclear fraction 4-5 fold increased in unloaded soleus as compared to the control values. These data obtained by means of electrophoresis and western blot of the nuclear fraction of rat soleus were confirmed in the immunohistochemical study of co-localization of MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 antibodies and DAPI nuclear stain on transverse frozen sections of soleus muscle. Thus in the present study we observed the phenomenon of MuRF isoforms accumulation in nuclei of soleus muscle fibers during simulated gravitational unloadin.
occurs in patients with advanced cancers. Despite the adverse clinical impact of cancer-induced muscle wasting, pathways causing cachexia are controversial, and clinically reliable therapies are not available. A trigger of muscle protein loss is the Jak/Stat pathway, and indeed, we found that conditioned medium from C26 colon carcinoma (C26) or Lewis lung carcinoma cells activates Stat3 (p-Stat3) in C2C12 myotubes. We identified two proteolytic pathways that are activated in muscle by p-Stat3; one is activation of caspase-3, and the other is p-Stat3 to myostatin, MAFbx/Atrogin-1, and MuRF-1 via CAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ). Using sequential deletions of the caspase-3 promoter and CHIP assays, we determined that Stat3 activation increases caspase-3 expression in C2C12 cells. Caspase-3 expression and proteolytic activity were stimulated by p-Stat3 in muscles of tumor-bearing mice. In mice with cachexia caused by Lewis lung carcinoma or C26 tumors, knock-out of p-Stat3 in muscle or with a small chemical inhibitor of p-Stat3 suppressed muscle mass losses, improved protein synthesis and degradation in muscle, and increased body weight and grip strength. Activation of p-Stat3 stimulates a pathway from C/EBPδ to myostatin and expression of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and increases the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Indeed, C/EBPδ KO decreases the expression of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 and myostatin, while increasing muscle mass and grip strength. In conclusion, cancer stimulates p-Stat3 in muscle, activating protein loss by stimulating caspase-3, myostatin, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These results could lead to novel strategies for preventing cancer-induced muscle wastin.
cal significance of diaphragm weakness in critically ill patients is evident: it prolongs ventilator dependency, and increases morbidity and duration of hospital stay. To date, the nature of diaphragm weakness and its underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are poorly understoo.
esized that diaphragm muscle fibers of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients display atrophy and contractile weakness, and that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is activated in the diaphrag.
ed diaphragm muscle biopsies from 22 critically ill patients who received mechanical ventilation before surgery and compared these with biopsies obtained from patients during thoracic surgery for resection of a suspected early lung malignancy (control subjects). In a proof-of-concept study in a muscle-specific ring finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) knockout mouse model, we evaluated the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the development of contractile weakness during mechanical ventilatio.
- and fast-twitch diaphragm muscle fibers of critically ill patients had approximately 25% smaller cross-sectional area, and had contractile force reduced by half or more. Markers of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were significantly up-regulated in the diaphragm of critically ill patients. Finally, MuRF-1 knockout mice were protected against the development of diaphragm contractile weakness during mechanical ventilatio.
dings show that diaphragm muscle fibers of critically ill patients display atrophy and severe contractile weakness, and in the diaphragm of critically ill patients the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is activated. This study provides rationale for the development of treatment strategies that target the contractility of diaphragm fibers to facilitate weanin.
is a frequent complication in patients with respiratory failure, such as lung fibrosis, and it is a determining factor for functional capacity, health status, and mortality. Reductions in body weight and skeletal muscle mass are key features of cachexia that are resistant to current therapies. Rikkunshito (RKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is widely used for the treatment for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and known to stimulate ghrelin secretion. By using bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis mice in this study, we tested our hypothesis that RKT administration could ameliorate pulmonary cachexia. After BLM administration, mice were provided with either RKT or distilled water on a daily basis. Compared with the BLM-injected mice, the RKT-treated mice had smaller reductions of food intake and body weight. Skeletal muscle weights were retained in the RKT-treated mice, in conjunction with reduced expressions of MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 in the lysates of skeletal muscle found in lung fibrosis. Rikkunshito administration restored the plasma concentrations of ghrelin in BLM-injected mice. The anticachectic efficacies of RKT administration in BLM-injected mice were canceled by the concurrent treatment of a ghrelin receptor antagonist. Rikkunshito administration did not decrease the degree of loss of body weight or food intake reduction in either ghrelin-deficient mice or growth hormone secretagogue receptor-deficient mice. Our results indicate that RKT administration exerts protective effects on pulmonary cachexia by ameliorating skeletal muscle wasting and food intake reduction as mediated by the ghrelin system and, thus, highlight RKT as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of lung fibrosi.
muscle atrophy is a pathological condition characterized by the loss of strength and muscle mass, an increase in myosin heavy chain (MHC) degradation and increase in the expression of two muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases: atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. Angiotensin II (AngII) induces muscle atrophy. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], through its receptor Mas, produces the opposite effects than AngII. We assessed the effects of Ang-(1-7) on the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by AngII. Our results show that Ang-(1-7), through Mas, prevents the effects induced by AngII in muscle gastrocnemius: the decrease in the fibre diameter, muscle strength and MHC levels and the increase in atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. Ang-(1-7) also induces AKT phosphorylation. In addition, our analysis in vitro using C2C12 myotubes shows that Ang-(1-7), through a mechanism dependent on Mas, prevents the decrease in the levels of MHC and the increase in the expression of the atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, both induced by AngII. Ang-(1-7) induces AKT phosphorylation in myotubes; additionally, we demonstrated that the inhibition of AKT with MK-2206 decreases the anti-atrophic effects of Ang-(1-7). Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that Ang-(1-7) counteracts the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by AngII through a mechanism dependent on the Mas receptor, which involves AKT activity. Our study indicates that Ang-(1-7) is novel molecule with a potential therapeutical use to improve muscle wasting associated, at least, with pathologies that present high levels of AngI.
s of anabolic and catabolic signaling pathways were investigated in postural/tonic m. longissimus dorsi of mice following the 30-day orbital flight of biosatellite &quot;Bion-M1&quot; and 8-day recovery. Western blotting was used for determining insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and AMR-activated protein kinase (AMPK) involved in reciprocal regulation of anabolic and catabolic pathways, as well as E3-ligase MURF-1, and elongation factor eEF2. Functioning of the IGF-1-dependent IRS-1 signaling pathway was activated in the recovery period only. Though the content of ubiquitinligase MURF-1 showed an increase after flight, on completion of the recovery period it did not exceed the pre-flight level unambiguousl.
s linked to insulin resistance, a primary component of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. The problem of obesity-related insulin resistance is compounded when age-related skeletal muscle loss, called sarcopenia, occurs with obesity. Skeletal muscle loss results from elevated levels of protein degradation and prevention of obesity-related sarcopenic muscle loss will depend on strategies that target pathways involved in protein degradation. An extract from Artemisia dracunculus, termed PMI 5011, improves insulin signaling and increases skeletal muscle myofiber size in a rodent model of obesity-related insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of PMI 5011 on the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a central regulator of muscle protein degradatio.
mius and vastus lateralis skeletal muscle was obtained from KK-A(y) obese diabetic mice fed a control or 1% (w/w) PMI 5011-supplemented diet. Regulation of genes encoding enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactio.
MuRF-1 ubiquitin ligase gene expression is consistently down-regulated in skeletal muscle, atrogin-1, Fbxo40, and Traf6 expression is differentially regulated by PMI 5011. Genes encoding other enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system ranging from ubiquitin to ubiquitin-specific proteases are also regulated by PMI 5011. Additionally, expression of the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3), a ubiquitin-like protein pivotal to autophagy-mediated protein degradation, is down-regulated by PMI 5011 in the vastus laterali.
alters the gene expression of ubiquitin-proteasome system enzymes that are essential regulators of skeletal muscle mass. This suggests that PMI 5011 has therapeutic potential in the treatment of obesity-linked sarcopenia by regulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradatio.
f this study was to evaluate the effects of resistance exercise on the mRNA expression of muscle mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), muscle-specific RING finger-1 (MuRF-1), and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) in the presence or absence of whey protein ingestion. We hypothesized that resistance exercise in combination with whey protein ingestion alters the gene expression of proteins related to muscle protein synthesis (mTOR) and/or degradation (MuRF-1 and MAFbx), thus affecting muscle weight gain in rat.
o male Fischer rats were randomly assigned to the following four experimental groups (n = 8/group): Control sedentary, control exercised, whey protein sedentary, and whey protein exercised. Exercise consisted of inducing the animals to perform sets of jumps for 8 wk. Body weight gain, muscle weights, food intake, and feeding efficiency were evaluated. Gene expressions were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Statistical evaluation was performed using a two-way analysis of variance with a Tukey post hoc tes.
ein exercised rats exhibited higher body and muscle weight gain compared with control-exercised rats (P = 0.032). The expression of mTOR was reduced by exercise but increased when whey protein was consumed as a dietary protein (P = 0.005). MuRF-1 expression was reduced by exercise (P &lt; 0.001), whereas MAFbx was reduced only by whey protein ingestion (P = 0.008) independent of exercis.
on in MAFbx gene transcription induced by whey protein and the interaction between exercise and whey protein ingestion on mTOR gene expression contributed significantly to differences in body and muscle weight gai.
in (DOX) is a potent antitumor agent used in cancer treatment. Unfortunately, DOX can induce myopathy in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, which limits its clinical use. Importantly, exercise training has been shown to protect against DOX-mediated cardiac and skeletal muscle myopathy. However, the mechanisms responsible for this exercise-induced muscle protection remain elusive. These experiments tested the hypothesis that short-term exercise training protects against acute DOX-induced muscle toxicity, in part, due to decreased forkhead-box O (FoxO) transcription of atrophy genes. Rats (n = 6 per group) were assigned to sedentary or endurance exercise-trained groups and paired with either placebo or DOX treatment. Gene expression and protein abundance were measured in both cardiac and skeletal muscles to determine the impact of DOX and exercise on FoxO gene targets. Our data demonstrate that DOX administration amplified FoxO1 and FoxO3 mRNA expression and increased transcription of FoxO target genes [i.e., atrogin-1/muscle atrophy F-box (MaFbx), muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF-1), and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)] in heart and soleus muscles. Importantly, exercise training protected against DOX-induced increases of FoxO1 and MuRF-1 in cardiac muscle and also prevented the rise of FoxO3, MuRF-1, and BNIP3 in soleus muscle. Furthermore, our results indicate that exercise increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) in both the heart and soleus muscles. This is important because increased PGC-1α expression is known to suppress FoxO activity resulting in reduced expression of FoxO target genes. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise training protects against DOX-induced myopathy in both heart (FoxO1 and MuRF-1) and skeletal muscles (FoxO3, MuRF-1, and BNIP3.
ecific RING finger-1 (MuRF-1), a ubiquitin ligase and key regulator of proteasome-dependent protein degradation, is highly expressed during skeletal muscle atrophy. The transcription factor forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) induces MuRF-1 expression, but the direct role of other major atrophy-related transcription factors, such as SMAD3, is largely unknown. The goal of this study was to determine whether SMAD3 individually regulates, or with FoxO3 coordinately regulates, MuRF-1 expression. In cultured myotubes or human embryonic kidney cells, MuRF-1 mRNA content and promoter activity were increased by FoxO3 but not by SMAD3 overexpression. However, FoxO3 and SMAD3 coexpression synergistically increased MuRF-1 mRNA and promoter activity. Mutation of the SMAD-binding element (SBE) in the proximal MuRF-1 promoter or overexpression of a SMAD3 DNA-binding mutant attenuated FoxO3-dependent MuRF-1 promoter activation, showing that SMAD binding to DNA is required for optimal activation of FoxO3-induced transcription of MuRF-1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, SMAD3 DNA binding increased FoxO3 abundance and SBE mutation reduced FoxO3 abundance on the MuRF-1 promoter. Furthermore, SMAD3 overexpression dose-dependently increased FoxO3 protein content, and coexpression of FoxO3 and SMAD3 synergistically increased FoxO-dependent gene transcription [assessed with a FoxO response element (FRE)-driven reporter]. Collectively, these results show that SMAD3 regulates transcription of MuRF-1 by increasing FoxO3 binding at a conserved FRE-SBE motif within the proximal promoter region, and by increasing FoxO3 protein content and transcriptional activity. These data are the first to indicate that two major transcription factors regulating protein degradation, FoxO3 and SMAD3, converge to coordinately and directly regulate transcription of MuRF-.
f this study was to investigate the changes in the rates of both protein synthesis and breakdown, and the activation of intracellular effectors that control these processes in soleus muscles from growing rats fed a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet for 15 days. The mass and the protein content, as well as the rate of protein synthesis, were decreased in the soleus from LPHC-fed rats. The availability of amino acids was diminished, since the levels of various essential amino acids were decreased in the plasma of LPHC-fed rats. Overall rate of proteolysis was also decreased, explained by reductions in the mRNA levels of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, ubiquitin conjugates, proteasome activity, and in the activity of caspase-3. Soleus muscles from LPHC-fed rats showed increased insulin sensitivity, with increased levels of insulin receptor and phosphorylation levels of AKT, which probably explains the inhibition of both the caspase-3 activity and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The fall of muscle proteolysis seems to represent an adaptive response that contributes to spare proteins in a condition of diminished availability of dietary amino acids. Furthermore, the decreased rate of protein synthesis may be the driving factor to the lower muscle mass gain in growing rats fed the LPHC die.
-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) prevents deleterious muscle responses under pathological conditions, including tumor- and chronic steroid therapy-related muscle losses. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that HMB may modulate the balance between protein synthesis and degradation in the PI3K/Akt-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and FoxO1/FoxO3a-dependent mechanisms in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells. We also tested the effect of HMB on the expression of MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 in response to the inflammatory stress. β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate up-regulated phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, and these effects were completely abolished in the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002. β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate also up-regulated FoxO1 and FoxO3a phosphorylation, and these changes were inhibited by LY294002. Although, unexpectedly, HMB failed to reduce the expressions of atrophy-related atrogin-1 messenger RNA and the protein response to the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α plus interferon γ, HMB did attenuate the MuRF-1 expression. Thus, HMB appears to restore the balance between intracellular protein synthesis and proteolysis, likely via activation of the PI3K/Akt-dependent mTOR and FoxO1/FoxO3a signaling pathway and the reduction of tumor necrosis factor α/interferon γ-induced MuRF-1 expression, thereby ameliorating aging-related muscle atroph.
n of muscle mass depends on the balance between synthesis and degradation of proteins, which is under the control of different signalling pathways regulated by hormonal, neural and nutritional stimuli. Such stimuli are altered in several pathologies, including COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, AIDS and cancer (cachexia), as well as in some conditions such as immobilization and aging (sarcopenia), leading to muscle atrophy, which represents a significant contribution to patient morbidity. The KKS (kallikrein-kinin system) is composed of the enzymes kallikreins, which generate active peptides called kinins that activate two G-protein-coupled receptors, namely B1 and B2, which are expressed in a variety of tissues. The local modulation of the KKS may account for its participation in different diseases, such as those of the cardiovascular, renal and central nervous systems, cancer and many inflammatory processes, including pain. Owing to such pleiotropic actions of the KKS by local modulatory events and the probable fine-tuning of associated signalling cascades involved in skeletal muscle catabolic disorders [for example, NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt pathways], we hypothesized that KKS might contribute to the modulation of intracellular responses in atrophying skeletal muscle. Our results show that kinin B1 receptor activation induced a decrease in the diameter of C2C12 myotubes, activation of NF-κB, a decrease in Akt phosphorylation levels, and an increase in the mRNA levels of the ubiquitin E3 ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (muscle RING-finger protein-1). In vivo, we observed an increase in kinin B1 receptor mRNA levels in an androgen-sensitive model of muscle atrophy. In the same model, inhibition of the kinin B1 receptor with a selective antagonist resulted in an impairment of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 expression and IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) phosphorylation. Moreover, knockout of the kinin B1 receptor in mice led to an impairment in MuRF-1 mRNA expression after induction of LA (levator ani) muscle atrophy. In conclusion, using pharmacological and gene-ablation tools, we have obtained evidence that the kinin B1 receptor plays a significant role in the regulation of skeletal muscle proteolysis in the LA muscle atrophy mode.
nisms of muscle wasting and decreased mobility have a major functional effect in rheumatoid arthritis, but they have been poorly studied. The objective of our study is to describe muscular involvement and the pathways in an experimental model of arthritis compared to the pathways in disuse atrophy. Female Wistar rats were separated into three groups: control (CO), collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), and immobilized (IM). Spontaneous locomotion and weight were evaluated weekly. The gastrocnemius muscle was evaluated by histology and immunoblotting to measure the expression of myostatin (a negative regulator), LC3 (autophagy), MuRF-1 (proteasome-mediated proteolysis), MyoD, and myogenin (satellite-cell activation). The significance level was set at P &lt; 0.05, and histological analysis of joints confirmed the severity of the arthropathy. There was a significant difference in spontaneous locomotion in the CIA group. Animal body weight, gastrocnemius muscle weight, and relative muscle weight decreased 20%, 30%, and 20%, respectively, in the CIA rats. Inflammatory infiltration and swelling were present in the gastrocnemius muscles of the CIA rats. The mean cross-sectional area was reduced by 30% in the CIA group and by 60% in the IM group. The expressions of myostatin and LC3 between the groups were similar. There was increased expression of MuRF-1 in the IM (1.9-fold) and CIA (3.1-fold) groups and of myogenin in the muscles of the CIA animals (1.7-fold), while MyoD expression was decreased in the IM (20%) rats. This study demonstrated that the development of experimental arthritis is associated with decreased mobility, body weight, and muscle loss. Both IM and CIA animal models presented muscle atrophy, but while proteolysis and the regeneration pathways were activated in the CIA model, there was no activation of regeneration in the IM model. We can assume that muscle atrophy in experimental arthritis is associated with the disease itself and not simply with decreased mobilit.
ve cardiac hypertrophy owing to pathological stimuli, such as pressure overload, is frequently associated with the development of heart failure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs are extensively involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the miR-19a/b family acts as a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. Forced overexpression of miR-19a/b was sufficient to induce hypertrophy in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-19a/b directly target the anti-hypertrophic genes atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (muscle RING-finger protein-1). The endogenous expressions of the target genes were down-regulated by miR-19a/b. Pro-hypertrophic calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) signalling was elevated markedly in the presence of miR-19b, and the calcineurin inhibitor CsA (cyclosporin A) and the PKC (protein kinase C) inhibitor GF10923X significantly attenuated the miR-19b-mediated increase in cell size and expression of hypertrophic markers. Furthermore, miR-19b led to increased cell survival through up-regulation of the NFAT target gene encoding α-crystallin-B and repression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) under ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress conditions. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that the miR-19a/b family regulates phenotypes of cardiomyocytes via suppression of multiple direct target gene.
y assessed and compared acute muscle molecular responses before and after 5-week training, employing either aerobic (AE) and resistance exercise (RE) or RE onl.
erformed one-legged RE, while the contralateral limb performed AE followed by RE 6 h later (AE+RE). Before (untrained) and after (trained) the intervention, acute bouts of RE were performed with or without preceding AE. Biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis of each leg pre- and 3 h post-RE to determine mRNA levels of VEGF, PGC-1α, MuRF-1, atrogin-1, myostatin and phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, rpS6 and eEF.
d VEGF expression increased (P &lt; 0.05) after acute RE in the untrained, but not the trained state. These markers showed greater response after AE+RE than RE in either condition. Myostatin was lower after AE+RE than RE, both before and after training. AE+RE showed higher MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 expression than RE in the untrained, not the trained state. Exercise increased (P &lt; 0.05) p70S6K phosphorylation both before and after training, yet this increase tended to be more prominent for AE+RE than RE before training. Phosphorylation of p70S6K was greater in trained muscle. Changes in these markers did not correlate with exercise-induced alterations in strength or muscle siz.
t exercise in untrained skeletal muscle prompts global molecular responses consistent with resulting whole muscle adaptations. Yet, training blunts the more robust anabolic response shown after AE+RE compared with RE. This study challenges the concept that single molecular markers could predict training-induced changes in muscle size or strengt.
 immobilization (IM) results in skeletal muscle atrophy accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inflammation, and protein degradation. However, the biological consequence of remobilizing such muscle has been studied only sparsely. In this study, we examined the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)-controlled mitochondrial biogenesis pathway and inflammatory response in mice subjected to 2 wk of hindlimb IM followed by 5 days of remobilization (RM). We hypothesized that ROS generation and activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways play important roles in the etiology of muscle injury. FVB/N mice (age 2 mo) were randomly assigned to either 14 days of IM by casting one of the hindlimbs (n = 7), IM followed by 5 days of RM with casting removed (n = 7), or to a control group (Con; n = 7). Muscle to body weight ratios of three major leg muscles were significantly decreased as a result of IM. Two ubiquitin-proteasome pathway enzymes, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFb or atrogin-1) and muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF-1), were upregulated with IM and maintained at high levels during RM. Protein contents of PGC-1α and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were reduced by 50% (P &lt; 0.01) in IM vs. Con, with no recovery observed during RM. IM suppressed mitochondrial transcription factor A and cytochrome-c content by 57% and 63% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, and cytochrome-c oxidase activity by 58% (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA content was reduced by 71% (P &lt; 0.01) with IM. None of these changes were reversed after RM. With RM, TA muscle showed a 2.3-fold (P &lt; 0.05) higher H2O2 content and a 4-fold (P &lt; 0.01) higher 8-isoprostane content compared with Con, indicating oxidative stress. Tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 levels in TA muscle were 4- and 3-fold higher (P &lt; 0.05), respectively, in IM and RM vs. CON. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation was observed only after RM, but not after IM alone. These data indicate an increase in ROS generation during the initial phase of muscle RM that could activate the NF-κB pathway, and elicit inflammation and oxidative stress. These events may hinder muscle recovery from IM-induced mitochondrial deterioration and protein los.
zone (RGZ) and imidapril improve cancer cachexia via different mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that combination therapy of RGZ+imidapril would further attenuate cancer cachexia in vivo. After injection with colon-26 adenocarcinoma for 9 days, BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the following four treatment groups for 7 days (n = 8 per group): (1) placebo, (2) RGZ, (3) imidapril, and (4) RGZ+imidapril. Eight healthy control animals were also assessed. Body weight, tumor volume, gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal adipose mass, serum metabolic markers and cytokines, and the expression of nuclear factor-κB and two E3 ubiquitin ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, were measured. From days 14 to 16, all treatments significantly reduced tumor volume (P &lt; 0.05). From days 10 to 16, improvements in the tumor-free body weight were observed in the RGZ and RGZ+imidapril groups. In addition, significant improvements in both gastrocnemius muscle and epididymal adipose mass were observed in all treatment groups (all, P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, all treatments significantly increased tumor necrosis factor alpha levels as compared to those observed in the healthy control animals (P &lt; 0.001). Insulin levels significantly increased in the placebo group as compared to those in the healthy control group (P &lt; 0.05), which were reduced in all the treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, whereas all treatments significantly reduced atrogin-1 levels as compared to the placebo group (all, P &lt; 0.05), significant reductions in MuRF-1 levels were only observed in the RGZ and RGZ+imidapril groups (both, P &lt; 0.05). Thus, all three treatments reduce tumor growth and alleviate cancer cachexia; however, synergistic effects of RGZ+imidapril combination therapy were not observe.
exercise training improves energetic metabolism, tissue perfusion and induces cardiac and skeletal muscle remodeling. Sildenafil, a potent phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction, reduces infarct size and increases tissue oxygenation in experimental models of cardiovascular disease. We have evaluated the effects of prolonged moderate exercise training and a repeat administration of sildenafil on the rat gastrocnemius and cardiac muscles. Animals were divided into two groups: sedentary and trained. Each group was subdivided into animals treated with vehicle or with two doses of sildenafil (10 or 15 mg/kg/day) during the last week of training. Physical exercise did not induce cardiac hypertrophy, whereas it increased mRNA levels of the PGC-1α, HIF-1α and VEGF genes, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, and reduced mRNA levels of FoxO3a, MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1. Sildenafil dose-dependently promoted both angiogenesis, as shown by increased capillary density, and muscle atrophy, as shown by muscle fibre size. These effects were more pronounced in trained animals. Our data confirm the beneficial effects of a moderate and prolonged training on cardiovascular and skeletal systems and document the positive and negative effects of sildenafil on these tissues at doses higher than those used in clinical practice. This report may impact on the use of sildenafil as a substance able to influence sports performanc.
udies demonstrate the importance of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, Muscle RING-Finger Protein 1 (MuRF-1) and atrogin-1, in muscle protein degradation during acute muscle atrophy. Small clinical studies suggest MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 expression in the quadriceps muscle is also increased in stable patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease compared to controls. However, it remains unclear whether these ligases have a role in maintaining a muscle-wasted state in COPD patient.
 COPD patients (16 with a low fat-free mass index (FFMI), 16 with a normal FFMI) and 15 controls underwent lung function and quadriceps strength tests and a percutaneous quadriceps biopsy. Quadriceps MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 protein were quantified with western blotting. Quadriceps fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and fiber proportions were determined by immunohistochemistry on muscle sections. MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 levels were compared between COPD patients with and without a low FFMI, and between patients and controls, and correlations between MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 levels and quadriceps fiber CSA in the patients were investigate.
 protein levels were lower in patients than controls, but similar in patients with a low and normal FFMI. MuRF-1 levels did not differ between any groups. MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 levels were not associated with quadriceps fiber CSA or quadriceps strength in patient.
pregulation of ubiquitin ligases was not evident in the quadriceps muscle of stable COPD patients with a low muscle mass. This does not exclude the possibility of transient increases in ubiquitin ligases during acute catabolic episode.
domain is a conserved zinc finger motif, which serves as a protein-protein interaction interface. Searches of a human heart expressed sequence tag data base for genes encoding the RING domain identified a novel cDNA, named striated muscle RING zinc finger protein (SMRZ). The SMRZ cDNA is 1.9 kilobase pairs in length and encodes a polypeptide of 288 amino acid residues; analysis of the peptide sequence demonstrated an N-terminal RING domain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization localized SMRZ to chromosome 1p33-34. Northern blots demonstrated that SMRZ is expressed exclusively in striated muscle. In the cardiovascular system, SMRZ is more highly expressed in the fetal heart than in the adult heart (slightly higher expression in the ventricle than in the atrium), suggesting that SMRZ is developmentally regulated. SMRZ was found to interact with SMT3b, a ubiquitin-like protein, through the SMRZ-RING domain. This interaction was abolished by mutagenesis of conserved RING domain residues. Transient transfection of SMRZ into C2C12 myoblasts showed localization of SMRZ to the nucleus. These data suggest that SMRZ may play an important role in striated muscle cell embryonic development and perhaps in cell cycle regulatio.
hondrial transcription termination factor (MTERF) family is a group of highly conserved DNA-binding proteins composed of four key members, MTERF1-4. To date, several studies have investigated the binding sites of MTERF1 on mitochondrial genome and the regulation of mitochondrial gene transcription, but the more intricate connection between mitochondrial genes transcription regulation, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and cell proliferation is still poorly understood. In this study, we constructed over-expression and knockdown vectors of MTERF1 that were transfected into HeLa cells to investigate the functions of MTERF1. Results showed that although MTERF1 is a positive regulatory factor of mitochondrial genes transcription, it had no significant effect on the replication of mitochondrial DNA. Over-expression of MTERF1 increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity and promoted ATP synthesis, cyclin D1 expression, and cell proliferation, while its knockdown inhibited ATP synthesis, decreased cyclin D1 expression, and slowed the cell growth. These results suggested that MTERF1 may promote cell proliferation by regulating oxidative phosphorylation activity in HeLa cells. Ultimately, these findings create a foundation for further and more conclusive studies on the physiological functions of MTERF family by providing novel insights into the potential mechanisms underlying cell proliferation regulatio.
rial transcription termination factor 1, MTERF1, has been reported to couple rRNA gene transcription initiation with termination and is therefore thought to be a key regulator of mammalian mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. The prevailing model is based on a series of observations published over the last two decades, but no in&nbsp;vivo evidence exists to show that MTERF1 regulates transcription of the heavy-strand region of mtDNA containing the rRNA genes. Here, we demonstrate that knockout of Mterf1 in mice has no effect on mitochondrial rRNA levels or mitochondrial translation. Instead, loss of Mterf1 influences transcription initiation at the light-strand promoter, resulting in a decrease of&nbsp;de novo transcription manifested as reduced 7S&nbsp;RNA levels. Based on these observations, we suggest that MTERF1 does not regulate heavy-strand transcription, but rather acts to block transcription on the opposite strand of mtDNA to prevent transcription interference at the light-strand promote.
ture of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (MTERF1) provides novel insight into the mechanism of binding, recognition of the termination sequence and the conformational changes involved in mediating termination. Besides its functional implications, this structure provides a framework to understand the consequences of numerous diseases associated with mitochondrial DNA mutation.
n of mtDNA is critical for biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation system, but the regulatory processes are poorly understood. Recent work in Cell (Yakubovskaya et al., 2010) reports a novel DNA-binding fold in mitochondrial transcription termination factor 1 (MTERF1), which causes unwinding and base eversion at its target mtDNA sequenc.
terize the organization of mtDNA-protein complexes (known as nucleoids) in vivo, we have probed the mtDNA surface exposure using site-specific DNA methyltransferases targeted to the mitochondria. We have observed that DNA methyltransferases have different accessibility to different sites on the mtDNA based on the levels of protein occupancy. We focused our studies on selected regions of mtDNA that are believed to be major regulatory regions involved in transcription and replication. The transcription termination region (TERM) within the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene was consistently and strongly protected from methylation, suggesting frequent and high affinity binding of mitochondrial transcription termination factor 1 (mTERF1) to the site. Protection from methylation was also observed in other regions of the mtDNA, including the light and heavy strand promoters (LSP, HSP) and the origin of replication of the light strand (OL). Manipulations aiming at increasing or decreasing the levels of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) led to decreased in vivo methylation, whereas manipulations that stimulated mtDNA replication led to increased methylation. We also analyzed the effect of ATAD3 and oxidative stress in mtDNA exposure. Our data provide a map of human mtDNA accessibility and demonstrate that nucleoids are dynamically associated with protein.
lian MTERF family of proteins has four members, named MTERF1 to MTERF4, which were identified in homology searches using the mitochondrial transcription termination factor, mTERF (here denoted MTERF1) as query. MTERF1 and MTERF3 are known to participate in the control of mitochondrial DNA transcription, but the function of the other two proteins is not known. We here investigate the structure and function of MTERF2. Protein import experiments using isolated organelles confirm that MTERF2 is a mitochondrial protein. Edman degradation of MTERF2 isolated from stably transfected HeLa cells demonstrates that mature MTERF2 lacks a targeting peptide (amino acids 1-35) present in the precursor form of the protein. MTERF2 is a monomer in isolation and displays a non sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. In vivo quantification experiments demonstrate that MTERF2 is relatively abundant, with one monomer present per approximately 265 bp of mtDNA. In comparison, the mtDNA packaging factor TFAM is present at a ratio of one molecule per approximately 10-12 bp of mtDNA. Using formaldehyde cross-linking we demonstrate that MTERF2 is present in nucleoids, and therefore must be located in close proximity to mtDNA. Taken together, our work provides a basic biochemical characterization of MTERF2, paving the way for future functional studie.
ene expression is crucial for organelle function, but the factors that control it are still largely unclear. Members of the so-called mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) family are found in metazoans and plants and regulate organellar gene expression at different levels. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mTERF6 is localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria, and its knockout perturbs plastid development and results in seedling lethality. In the leaky mterf6-1 mutant, a defect in photosynthesis is associated with reduced levels of photosystem subunits, although corresponding messenger RNA levels are unaffected, whereas translational capacity and maturation of chloroplast ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are perturbed in mterf6-1 mutants. Bacterial one-hybrid screening, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal a specific interaction between mTERF6 and an RNA sequence in the chloroplast isoleucine transfer RNA gene (trnI.2) located in the rRNA operon. In vitro, recombinant mTERF6 bound to its plastid DNA target site can terminate transcription. At present, it is unclear whether disturbed rRNA maturation is a primary or secondary defect. However, it is clear that mTERF6 is required for the maturation of trnI.2. This points to an additional function of mTERF.
rial transcription termination factor 4, MTERF4, a member of the MTERF family, has been implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial translation by targeting NSUN4 to the large mitochondrial ribosome. Here, we found a novel role for MTERF4 in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction induced by MPP(+). We observed that knockdown of MTERF4 in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in increased mitochondrial DNA transcription levels and decreased mitochondrial DNA translation levels. In addition, after treatment with 2&nbsp;mM MPP(+) for 24&nbsp;h, the expression levels of MTERF4 were decreased compared to wide-type SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, after exposure to 2&nbsp;mM MPP(+) for 24&nbsp;h, knockdown of MTERF4 in SH-SY5Y cells worsened the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by MPP(+), including increased reactive oxygen species, accumulated cleaved PARP-1, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and depressed mitochondrial complexes. Furthermore, overexpression of MTERF4 in SH-SY5Y cells partially alleviated the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by MPP(+). Based on these findings, we suggest that the main function of MTERF4 is regulating mtDNA expression, and it is the crucial factor in the mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells induced by MPP(+). MTERF4 probably is the triggering of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease induced by environmental toxi.
ular chaperone heat shock protein101 (HSP101) is required for acquired thermotolerance in plants and other organisms. To identify factors that interact with HSP101 or that are involved in thermotolerance, we screened for extragenic suppressors of a dominant-negative allele of Arabidopsis thaliana HSP101, hot1-4. One suppressor, shot1 (for suppressor of hot1-4 1), encodes a mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF)-related protein, one of 35 Arabidopsis mTERFs about which there is limited functional data. Missense (shot1-1) and T-DNA insertion (shot1-2) mutants suppress the hot1-4 heat-hypersensitive phenotype. Furthermore, shot1-2 suppresses other heat-sensitive mutants, and shot1-2 alone is more heat tolerant than the wild type. SHOT1 resides in mitochondria, indicating it functions independently of cytosolic/nuclear HSP101. Microarray analysis suggests altered mitochondrial function and/or retrograde signaling in shot1-2 increases transcripts of other HSPs and alters expression of redox-related genes. Reduced oxidative damage is the likely cause of shot1 thermotolerance, indicating HSP101 repairs protein oxidative damage and/or reduced oxidative damage allows recovery in the absence of HSP101. Changes in organelle-encoded transcripts in shot1 demonstrate that SHOT1 is involved in organelle gene regulation. The heat tolerance of shot1 emphasizes the importance of mitochondria in stress tolerance, and defining its function may provide insights into control of oxidative damage for engineering stress-resistant plant.
ian cells, a family of mitochondrial transcription termination factors (MTERFs) regulates mitochondrial gene expression. Mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3 (MTERF3) is the most conserved member of the MTERF family and a negative regulator of mammalian mitochondrial DNA transcription. To create a specific polyclonal antibody against human MTERF3 (hMTERF3), we first cloned hMTERF3 into prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-1, and GST-hMTERF3 was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli after induction by IPTG. The expressed GST-tagged hMTERF3 fusion protein was purified by passive electro-elution process and then used to immunize BALB/c mice, we obtained anti-GST-hMTERF3 polyclonal antibody purified by protein A column and determined the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody against human MTERF3 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assay. Furthermore, the full-length hMTERF3 protein expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells was detected by anti-GST-hMTERF3 in western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. Taken together, our results demonstrate the functionality of the mouse anti-GST-hMTERF3 polyclonal antibody which will provide a useful tool for further characterization of hMTERF.
rial function is essential for physical performance and health. Aerobic fitness is positively associated with mitochondrial (mt) biogenesis in muscle cells through partly unknown regulatory mechanisms. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of exercise and training status on key mt transcription factors in relation to oxidative capacity in human skeletal muscl.
 mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), mitochondrial transcription factors B1 (TFB1M) or B2 (TFB2M), and mRNA levels of mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF), were measured in a cross-sectional study with elite athletes (EA) and moderately active (MA) and the basal mRNA levels of these factors were measured during a 10-day endurance training programme with (R-leg) and without (NR-leg) restricted blood flow to the working le.
ein expression was significantly higher in the EA than in the MA, while protein levels of TFB1M and TFB2M were not different between the groups. There was no difference between EA and MA, or any effect with training on TFAM mRNA levels. However, the mRNA levels of TFB1M, TFB2M and mTERF were higher in EA compared with MA. For TFB1M and TFB2M, the mRNA expression was increased in the R-leg after 10 days of training, but not in the NR-leg. mTERF mRNA levels were higher in EA compared with M.
y further establishes that TFAM protein levels are higher in conditions with enhanced oxidative capacity. The mRNA levels of TFB1M and TFB2M are influenced by endurance training, possibly suggesting a role for these factors in the regulation of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesi.
tional flu mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana generates singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) in plastids during a dark-to-light shift. Seedlings of flu bleach and die, whereas mature plants stop growing and develop macroscopic necrotic lesions. Several suppressor mutants, dubbed singlet oxygen-linked death activator (soldat), were identified that abrogate (1)O(2)-mediated cell death of flu seedlings. One of the soldat mutations, soldat10, affects a gene encoding a plastid-localized protein related to the human mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF. As a consequence of this mutation, plastid-specific rRNA levels decrease and protein synthesis in plastids of soldat10 is attenuated. This disruption of chloroplast homeostasis in soldat10 seedlings affects communication between chloroplasts and the nucleus and leads to changes in the steady-state concentration of nuclear gene transcripts. The soldat10 seedlings suffer from mild photo-oxidative stress, as indicated by the constitutive up-regulation of stress-related genes. Even though soldat10/flu seedlings overaccumulate the photosensitizer protochlorophyllide in the dark and activate the expression of (1)O(2)-responsive genes after a dark-to-light shift they do not show a (1)O(2)-dependent cell death response. Disturbance of chloroplast homeostasis in emerging soldat10/flu seedlings seems to antagonize a subsequent (1)O(2)-mediated cell death response without suppressing (1)O(2)-dependent retrograde signaling. The results of this work reveal the unexpected complexity of what is commonly referred to as 'plastid signaling.
ria contain their own genetic system and undergo a unique mode of cytoplasmic inheritance. Each organelle has multiple copies of a covalently closed circular DNA genome (mtDNA). The entire protein coding capacity of mtDNA is devoted to the synthesis of 13 essential subunits of the inner membrane complexes of the respiratory apparatus. Thus the majority of respiratory proteins and all of the other gene products necessary for the myriad mitochondrial functions are derived from nuclear genes. Transcription of mtDNA requires a small number of nucleus-encoded proteins including a single RNA polymerase (POLRMT), auxiliary factors necessary for promoter recognition (TFB1M, TFB2M) and activation (Tfam), and a termination factor (mTERF). This relatively simple system can account for the bidirectional transcription of mtDNA from divergent promoters and key termination events controlling the rRNA/mRNA ratio. Nucleomitochondrial interactions depend on the interplay between transcription factors (NRF-1, NRF-2, PPARalpha, ERRalpha, Sp1, and others) and members of the PGC-1 family of regulated coactivators (PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta, and PRC). The transcription factors target genes that specify the respiratory chain, the mitochondrial transcription, translation and replication machinery, and protein import and assembly apparatus among others. These factors are in turn activated directly or indirectly by PGC-1 family coactivators whose differential expression is controlled by an array of environmental signals including temperature, energy deprivation, and availability of nutrients and growth factors. These transcriptional paradigms provide a basic framework for understanding the integration of mitochondrial biogenesis and function with signaling events that dictate cell- and tissue-specific energetic propertie.
lian mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF binds with high affinity to a site within the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene and regulates the amount of read through transcription from the ribosomal DNA into the remaining genes of the major coding strand of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and SELEX, using mitochondrial protein extracts from cells induced to overexpress mTERF, revealed novel, weaker mTERF-binding sites, clustered in several regions of mtDNA, notably in the major non-coding region (NCR). Such binding in vivo was supported by mtDNA immunoprecipitation. Two-dimensional neutral agarose gel electrophoresis (2DNAGE) and 5' end mapping by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) identified the region of the canonical mTERF-binding site as a replication pause site. The strength of pausing was modulated by the expression level of mTERF. mTERF overexpression also affected replication pausing in other regions of the genome in which mTERF binding was found. These results indicate a role for TERF in mtDNA replication, in addition to its role in transcription. We suggest that mTERF could provide a system for coordinating the passage of replication and transcription complexes, analogous with replication pause-region binding proteins in other systems, whose main role is to safeguard the integrity of the genome whilst facilitating its efficient expressio.
 mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF plays a central role in the control of heavy-strand rDNA transcription by promoting initiation, besides termination, of this transcription. However, until now, the mechanism underlying this stimulation of transcription by mTERF was not understood. In the present work, addition of mTERF to a HeLa cell mitochondrial lysate-based reaction mixture containing an artificial rDNA template did indeed specifically stimulate rDNA transcription. This stimulation required that mTERF be simultaneously bound to the rDNA transcription termination and initiation sites in the same molecule, thus forming a loop. Most significantly, a double binding of mTERF to the rDNA molecule, with resulting loop formation, was also shown in vivo. These results strongly suggest that, to satisfy the need for high rate of rDNA transcription, human mitochondrial rRNA synthesis involves mTERF-mediated rDNA looping that promotes recycling of the transcription machiner.
ys an important role in the regulation of cell cycle and cell growth. To identify novel serum-inhibitory factors and study their roles in cell cycle regulation, we performed mRNA differential display analysis of U251 cells in the presence or absence of serum and cloned a novel gene encoding the human mitochondrial transcription termination factor-like protein (mTERFL). The full-length mTERFL cDNA has been isolated and the genomic structure determined. The mTERFL gene consists of three exons and encodes 385 amino acids with 52% sequence similarity to the human mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF). However, mTERFL and mTERF have an opposite expression pattern in response to serum. The expression of mTERFL is dramatically inhibited by the addition of serum in serum-starved cells while the mTERF is rather induced. Northern blot analysis detected three mTERFL transcripts of 1.7, 3.2, and 3.5kb. Besides the 3.2kb transcript that is unique to skeletal muscle, other two transcripts express predominant in heart, liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. Expression of the GFP-mTERFL fusion protein in HeLa cells localized it to the mitochondria. Furthermore, ectopic expression of mTERFL suppresses cell growth and arrests cells in the G1 stage demonstrated by MTT and flow cytometry analysis. Collectively, our data suggest that mTERFL is a novel mTERF family member and a serum-inhibitory factor probably participating in the regulation of cell growth through the modulation of mitochondrial transcriptio.
hondrial ribomotor model has been proposed to explain how the balance between rRNA and mRNA in mammalian mitochondria is regulated. In this model, the interaction of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) with some unknown component(s), causes a loop to form in the mtDNA chain that brings the initiation and termination regions together at its base. By bringing these sites into closer proximity, the mtRNA polymerase molecules can be directly transferred from the termination site to the IH1 initiation site of the H-strand once transcription terminates. This process occurs when mTERF is phosphorylated. When unphosphorylated, transcription is initiated from the IH2 site and the polymerase reads through the mTERF-dependent termination site, resulting in the transcription of almost the entire H-stran.
 here the identification and characterization of mouse mTERF encoding a mitochondrial transcription termination factor. A full-length mTERF cDNA has been isolated and the genomic organization of mTERF has been elucidated. The mouse mTERF gene containing two exons encodes a 380 residue protein with a strong homology to the mTERF-like proteins of human and other organisms, related to mitochondrial transcription termination. Northern blot analysis detected both 1.4 and 5.4kb transcripts. The mouse mTERF 1.4kb transcript agreeing with the size of cDNA is predominately expressed in heart and liver, but at extremely low level in other tissues. In addition, a approximately 5.4kb transcript likely resulting from the retention of intron appears to express abundantly in heart and skeletal muscle, but at very low level in other tissues. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis of NIH3T3 cells expressing mTERF-GFP fusion protein demonstrated that the mouse mTERF localizes in mitochondrion. These observations suggest that the mouse mTERF is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial transcription termination factor, thereby promoting the termination of transcription in mitochondrial RN.
se to anoxia, embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana are able coordinately to downregulate metabolism to levels low enough to permit survival for several years at room temperature. In addition to dramatic decreases in free ATP levels and heat production, intracellular pH drops from 7.8 to 6.3 overnight. Use of isolated mitochondria to study transcriptional responses to anoxia offers several advantages: (1). the localized nature of transcript initiation, processing and degradation, all of which may be followed in organello; (2). the relatively simple cis- and trans-machinery involved and (3). the ability to provide relevant physiological treatments in vitro. In response to anoxic incubation of embryos in vivo for 4 h followed by anoxic mitochondrial isolation and anoxic transcription assay at pH 6.4, a significant decrease in overall UTP incorporation (77%) was seen after 30 min relative to normoxic, pH 7.9 controls. A less severe inhibition of transcription under anoxia (52%) was observed compared with controls when pH was raised to 7.9. Similarly, under normoxia, the incubation at low pH (6.4) reduced transcription by 59%. Ribonuclease protection assays showed that the contribution of in vitro initiation during the assay fell from 78% at pH 7.9 to approximately 32% at pH 6.4 under either normoxic or anoxic conditions. DNA footprinting of putative transcriptional promoters revealed proteins at regular intervals upstream of the 12S rRNA in the control region, which previously had been indirectly inferred to contain promoters for H-strand transcription. The area between 1230 and 12065 contains a sequence in the tRNA(leu) gene believed to bind the transcription termination factor mTERF or TERM, and we provide the first evidence that this sequence is protein-bound in A. franciscana. However, our hypothesis that initiation is reduced at low pH because of a change in DNA binding by mitochondrial transcription factors was not confirmed. We propose that regulation of initiation may be mediated by covalent modification or by protein-protein interactions not detected by footprintin.
esent work, the RNA polymerase activity of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase mature protein (h-mtRPOLm) is shown, and its molecular activity calculated (2.1+/-0.9 min(-1)). An activity analysis of h-mtRPOLm and deleted versions of it has demonstrated that the entire recombinant protein is required for this activity. In addition, h-mtRPOLm alone or in presence of the known mitochondrial transcription factors (human mitochondrial transcription factor A and/or human mitochondrial transcription termination factor) is not able to initiate transcription from the specific human mitochondrial promoters pointing to the existence of a human mitochondrial transcription factor B-like protei.
nalyzed the influence of in vivo treatment and in vitro addition of thyroid hormone on in organello mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription and, in parallel, on the in organello footprinting patterns at the mtDNA regions involved in the regulation of transcription. We found that thyroid hormone modulates mitochondrial RNA levels and the mRNA/rRNA ratio by influencing the transcriptional rate. In addition, we found conspicuous differences between the mtDNA dimethyl sulfate footprinting patterns of mitochondria derived from euthyroid and hypothyroid rats at the transcription initiation sites but not at the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) binding region. Furthermore, direct addition of thyroid hormone to the incubation medium of mitochondria isolated from hypothyroid rats restored the mRNA/rRNA ratio found in euthyroid rats as well as the mtDNA footprinting patterns at the transcription initiation area. Therefore, we conclude that the regulatory effect of thyroid hormone on mitochondrial transcription is partially exerted by a direct influence of the hormone on the mitochondrial transcription machinery. Particularly, the influence on the mRNA/rRNA ratio is achieved by selective modulation of the alternative H-strand transcription initiation sites and does not require the previous activation of nuclear genes. These results provide the first functional demonstration that regulatory signals, such as thyroid hormone, that modify the expression of nuclear genes can also act as primary signals for the transcriptional apparatus of mitochondri.
ing studies with the purine-modifying reagent dimethyl sulfate and with the single-stranded DNA probing reagent potassium permanganate were carried out in isolated mitochondria from rat liver. Dimethyl sulfate footprinting allowed the detection of protein-DNA interactions within the rat analogues of the human binding sites for the transcription termination factor mTERF and for the transcription activating factor mt-TFA. Although mTERF contacts were localized only at the boundary between the 16S rRNA/tRNA(Leu)UUR genes, multiple mtTFA contacts were detected. Contact sites were located in the light and the heavy strand promoters and, in agreement with in vitro footprinting data on human mitochondria, between the conserved sequence blocks (CSB) 1 and 2 and inside CSB-1. Potassium permanganate footprinting allowed detection of a 25-base pair region entirely contained in CSB-1 in which both strands were permanganate-reactive. No permanganate reactivity was associated with the other regions of the D-loop, including CSB-2 and -3, and with the mTERF contact site. We hypothesize that the single-stranded DNA at CSB-1 may be due to a profound helix distortion induced by mtTFA binding or be associated with a RNA polymerase pause site. In any case the location in CSB-1 of the 3' end of the most abundant replication primer and of the 5' end of the prominent D-loop DNA suggests that protein-induced DNA conformational changes play an important role in directing the transition from transcription to replication in mammalian mitochondri.
omains constructed from tandem α-helical repeats have until recently been primarily associated with protein scaffolds or RNA recognition. Recent crystal structures of human mitochondrial termination factor MTERF1 and Bacillus cereus alkylpurine DNA glycosylase AlkD bound to DNA revealed two new superhelical tandem repeat architectures capable of wrapping around the double helix in unique ways. Unlike DNA sequence recognition motifs that rely mainly on major groove read-out, MTERF and ALK motifs locate target sequences and aberrant nucleotides within DNA by resculpting the double-helix through extensive backbone contacts. Comparisons between MTERF and ALK repeats, together with recent advances in ssRNA recognition by Pumilio/FBF (PUF) domains, provide new insights into the fundamental principles of protein-nucleic acid recognitio.
rial activity and cell energy status play important roles in the regulation of cell cycle and cell proliferation. Regulation of mitochondrial gene expression is crucial for mitochondrial activity regulation. The mitochondrial transcription termination factor (MTERF) family is a group of important mitochondrial transcription regulatory factors. It has been demonstrated that MTERF1-3 are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial gene transcription and oxidative phosphorylation. However, the function of the newest member MTERF4 has not been characterized. In this study, human MTERF4 full-length open reading frame was cloned, and the protein structure prediction revealed that hMTERF4 protein contained leucine-zipper motifs, which is similar to human MTERF1-3. The expressed pMTERF4-green fluorescence fusion protein in HeLa cells localized the mitochondria. (3(4,5)dimethylthiahiazo(zy1)3,5diphenytetrazoliumromide) (MTT) proliferation assay and flow cytometry analysis showed that hMTERF4 knockdown induced sub-G1 phase cells accumulation, whereas its overexpression promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, double staining with Annexin V and PI revealed that hMTERF4 knockdown increased necrosis but not apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggested that hMTERF4 is an essential factor for cell proliferation, which is probably modulated by mitochondrial transcription to promote cell proliferatio.
 family is a large protein family, identified in metazoans and plants, which consists of four subfamilies, MTERF1, 2, 3 and 4. Mitochondrial localisation was predicted for the vast majority of MTERF family members and demonstrated for the characterised MTERF proteins. The main structural feature of MTERF proteins is the presence of a modular architecture, based on repetitions of a 30-residue module, the mTERF motif, containing leucine zipper-like heptads. The MTERF family includes transcription termination factors: human mTERF, sea urchin mtDBP and Drosophila DmTTF. In addition to terminating transcription, they are involved in transcription initiation and in the control of mtDNA replication. This multiplicity of functions seems to flank differences in the gene organisation of mitochondrial genomes. MTERF2 and MTERF3 play antithetical roles in controlling mitochondrial transcription: that is, mammalian and Drosophila MTERF3 act as negative regulators, whereas mammalian MTERF2 functions as a positive regulator. Both proteins contact mtDNA in the promoter region, perhaps establishing interactions, either mutual or with other factors. Regulation of MTERF gene expression in human and Drosophila depends on nuclear transcription factors NRF-2 and DREF, respectively, and proceeds through pathways which appear to discriminate between factors positively or negatively acting in mitochondrial transcription. In this emerging scenario, it appears that MTERF proteins act to coordinate mitochondrial transcriptio.
n mitochondrial gene expression are associated with aging and disease. Mterf proteins have been implicated in modulating transcription, replication and protein synthesis. We have solved the structure of a member of this family, the human mitochondrial transcriptional terminator MTERF1, bound to dsDNA containing the termination sequence. The structure indicates that upon sequence recognition MTERF1 unwinds the DNA molecule, promoting eversion of three nucleotides. Base flipping is critical for stable binding and transcriptional termination. Additional structural and biochemical results provide insight into the DNA binding mechanism and explain how MTERF1 recognizes its target sequence. Finally, we have demonstrated that the mitochondrial pathogenic G3249A and G3244A mutations interfere with key interactions for sequence recognition, eliminating termination. Our results provide insight into the role of mterf proteins and suggest a link between mitochondrial disease and the regulation of mitochondrial transcriptio.
n of mitochondrial protein expression is crucial for the function of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Although the basal machinery for mitochondrial transcription is known, the regulatory mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we characterized mTERF2, a mitochondria-localized homolog of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF1. We show that inactivation of mTERF2 in the mouse results in a myopathy and memory deficits associated with decreased levels of mitochondrial transcripts and imbalanced tRNA pool. These aberrations were associated with decreased steady-state levels of OXPHOS proteins causing a decrease in respiratory function. mTERF2 binds to the mtDNA promoter region, suggesting that it affects transcription initiation. In vitro interaction studies suggest that mtDNA mediates interactions between mTERF2 and mTERF3. Our results indicate that mTERF1, mTERF2, and mTERF3 regulate transcription by acting in the same site in the mtDNA promoter region and thereby mediate fine-tuning of mitochondrial transcription and hence OXPHOS functio.
 family is a wide protein family, identified in Metazoa and plants, which consists of 4 subfamilies named MTERF1-4. Proteins belonging to this family are localized in mitochondria and show a modular architecture based on repetitions of a 30 amino acid module, the mTERF motif, containing leucine zipper-like heptads. The MTERF family includes the characterized transcription termination factors human mTERF, sea urchin mtDBP and Drosophila DmTTF. In vitro and in vivo studies show that these factors play different roles which are not restricted to transcription termination, but concern also transcription initiation and the control of mtDNA replication. The multiplicity of functions could be related to the differences in the gene organization of the mitochondrial genomes. Studies on the function of human and Drosophila MTERF3 factor showed that the protein acts as negative regulator of mitochondrial transcription, possibly in cooperation with other still unknown factors. The complete elucidation of the role of the MTERF family members will contribute to the unraveling of the molecular mechanisms of mtDNA transcription and replicatio.
, MPV17 mutations are responsible for severe mitochondrial depletion syndrome, mainly affecting the liver and the nervous system. To gain insight into physiopathology of MPV17-related disease, we investigated an available Mpv17 knockout animal model. We found severe mtDNA depletion in liver and, albeit to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle, whereas hardly any depletion was detected in brain and kidney, up to 1 year after birth. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts did show mtDNA depletion, but only after several culturing passages, or in a serumless culturing medium. In spite of severe mtDNA depletion, only moderate decrease in respiratory chain enzymatic activities, and mild cytoarchitectural alterations, were observed in the Mpv17(-/-) livers, but neither cirrhosis nor failure ever occurred in this organ at any age. The mtDNA transcription rate was markedly increased in liver, which could contribute to compensate the severe mtDNA depletion. This phenomenon was associated with specific downregulation of Mterf1, a negative modulator of mtDNA transcription. The most relevant clinical features involved skin, inner ear and kidney. The coat of the Mpv17(-/-) mice turned gray early in adulthood, and 18-month or older mice developed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with massive proteinuria. Concomitant degeneration of cochlear sensory epithelia was reported as well. These symptoms were associated with significantly shorter lifespan. Coincidental with the onset of FSGS, there was hardly any mtDNA left in the glomerular tufts. These results demonstrate that Mpv17 controls mtDNA copy number by a highly tissue- and possibly cytotype-specific mechanis.
ture of mitochondrial translation is the reduced number of transfer RNAs and reassignment of codons. For human mitochondria, a major unresolved problem is how the set of stop codons are decoded by the release factors mtRF1a and mtRF1. Here we present three-dimensional structural models of human mtRF1a and mtRF1 based on their homology to bacterial RF1 in the codon recognition domain, and the strong conservation between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomal RNA in the decoding region. Sequence changes in the less homologous mtRF1 appear to be correlated with specific features of the mitochondrial rRNA. Extensive computer simulations of the complexes with the ribosomal decoding site show that both mitochondrial factors have similar specificities and that neither reads the putative vertebrate stop codons AGA and AGG. Instead, we present a structural model for a mechanism by which the ICT1 protein causes termination by sensing the presence of these codons in the A-site of stalled ribosome.
mic Hereditary Hearing Loss is a common disorder accounting for at least 60% of prelingual deafness. GJB2 gene mutations, GJB6 deletion, and the A1555G mitochondrial mutation play a major role worldwide in causing deafness, but there is a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and many genes involved in deafness have not yet been identified. Therefore, there remains a need to search for new causative mutations. In this study, a combined strategy using both linkage analysis and sequencing identified a new mutation causing hearing loss. Linkage analysis identified a region of 40 Mb on chromosome 5q13 (LOD score 3.8) for which exome sequencing data revealed a mutation (c.7873 T&gt;G leading to p.*2625Gluext*11) in the BDP1 gene (B double prime 1, subunit of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor IIIB) in patients from a consanguineous Qatari family of second degree, showing bilateral, post-lingual, sensorineural moderate to severe hearing impairment. The mutation disrupts the termination codon of the transcript resulting in an elongation of 11 residues of the BDP1 protein. This elongation does not contain any known motif and is not conserved across species. Immunohistochemistry studies carried out in the mouse inner ear showed Bdp1 expression within the endothelial cells in the stria vascularis, as well as in mesenchyme-derived cells surrounding the cochlear duct. The identification of the BDP1 mutation increases our knowledge of the molecular bases of Nonsyndromic Hereditary Hearing Loss and provides new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease in the Qatari populatio.
ession in plant mitochondria involves a complex collaboration of transcription initiation and termination, as well as subsequent mRNA processing to produce mature mRNAs. In this study, we describe the function of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial stability factor 1 (MTSF1) gene and show that it encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein essential for the 3'-processing of mitochondrial nad4 mRNA and its stability. The nad4 mRNA is highly destabilized in Arabidopsis mtsf1 mutant plants, which consequently accumulates low amounts of a truncated form of respiratory complex I. Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that MTSF1 binds with high affinity to the last 20 nucleotides of nad4 mRNA. Our data support a model for MTSF1 functioning in which its association with the last nucleotides of the nad4 3' untranslated region stabilizes nad4 mRNA. Additionally, strict conservation of the MTSF1-binding sites strongly suggests that the protective function of MTSF1 on nad4 mRNA is conserved in dicots. These results demonstrate that the mRNA stabilization process initially identified in plastids, whereby proteins bound to RNA extremities constitute barriers to exoribonuclease progression occur in plant mitochondria to protect and concomitantly define the 3' end of mature mitochondrial mRNAs. Our study also reveals that short RNA molecules corresponding to pentatricopeptide repeat-binding sites accumulate also in plant mitochondri.
as to investigate whether dietary wolfberry altered carotenoid metabolic gene expression and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in the retina of diabetic mic.
old male db/db and wild-type mice were fed the control or wolfberry diets for 8 weeks. At study termination, liver and retinal tissues were collected for analysis by transmission electron microscopy, real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and HPLC. Wolfberry elevated zeaxanthin and lutein levels in the liver and retinal tissues and stimulated expression of retinal scavenger receptor class B type I, glutathione S-transferase Pi 1, and β,β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase 2, and induced activation and nuclear enrichment of retinal AMP-activated protein kinase α2 (AMPK-α2). Furthermore, wolfberry attenuated hypoxia and mitochondrial stress as demonstrated by declined expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and heat shock protein 60. Wolfberry enhanced retinal mitochondrial biogenesis in diabetic retinas as demonstrated by reversed mitochondrial dispersion in the retinal pigment epithelium, increased mitochondrial copy number, elevated citrate synthase activity, and upregulated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α, nuclear respiratory factor 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor&nbsp;.
on of dietary wolfberry could be beneficial to retinoprotection through reversal of mitochondrial function in diabetic mic.
n of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression is critical for the control of oxidative phosphorylation in response to physiological demand, and this regulation is often impaired in disease and aging. We have previously shown that mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3 (MTERF3) is a key regulator that represses mtDNA transcription in the mouse, but its molecular mode of action has remained elusive. Based on the hypothesis that key regulatory mechanisms for mtDNA expression are conserved in metazoans, we analyzed Mterf3 knockout and knockdown flies. We demonstrate here that decreased expression of MTERF3 not only leads to activation of mtDNA transcription, but also impairs assembly of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This novel function of MTERF3 in mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis is conserved in the mouse, thus we identify a novel and unexpected role for MTERF3 in coordinating the crosstalk between transcription and translation for the regulation of mammalian mtDNA gene expressio.
er rhodopsin (Rho) rat (line 4) bears the rhodopsin gene with an early termination codon at residue 334 that is a model for several such mutations found in human patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP). The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is implicated in the pathophysiology of several retinal disorders including ADRP in P23H Rho rats. The aim of this study was to examine the onset of UPR gene expression in S334ter Rho retinas to determine if UPR is activated in ADRP animal models and to investigate how the activation of UPR molecules leads to the final demise of S334ter Rho photoreceptors. RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the gene expression profiles for the P10, P12, P15, and P21 stages of the development and progression of ADRP in S334ter Rho photoreceptors. We determined that during the P12-P15 period, ER stress-related genes are strongly upregulated in transgenic retinas, resulting in the activation of the UPR that was confirmed using western blot analysis and RT-PCR. The activation of UPR was associated with the increased expression of JNK, Bik, Bim, Bid, Noxa, and Puma genes and cleavage of caspase-12 that together with activated calpains presumably compromise the integrity of the mitochondrial MPTP, leading to the release of pro-apoptotic AIF1 into the cytosol of S334ter Rho photoreceptor cells. Therefore, two major cross-talking pathways, the UPR and mitochondrial MPTP occur in S334ter-4 Rho retina concomitantly and eventually promote the death of the photoreceptor cell.
ochondrial transcription termination factor 2 (MTERF2) is a member of the mitochondrial transcription termination factors (MTERFs) family and a cell growth inhibitor. To create a specific mouse monoclonal antibody against human MTERF2, the full-length His-tag MTERF2 protein (1-385 aa) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified recombinant protein was injected into three BALB/c mice to perform an immunization procedure. Eight stable positive monoclonal cell lines were screened and established. ELISA results demonstrated that all antibody light chains were kappa, while the heavy chains displayed three subtypes IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the monoclonal antibodies against human MTERF2 were determined using immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses. Furthermore, serum regulation of human MTERF2 protein expression levels in human glioma U251 cells was examined with these monoclonal antibodies and the results demonstrated that the expression level of MTERF2 protein was dramatically inhibited by the addition of serum to serum-starved cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate the functionality of these mouse anti-human MTERF2 monoclonal antibodies, which may provide a useful tool to elucidate the role of MTERF2 in human mitochondrial transcription as well as other potential activities. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the preparation and characterization of mouse monoclonal antibodies against human MTERF.
on of hyperglycemia does not arrest the progression of diabetic retinopathy, and retinal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remains damaged, resulting in a continuous cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction. This study is to investigate the role of mitochondria biogenesis (regulated by nuclear mitochondrial signaling) in the metabolic memory phenomeno.
ria DNA copy number, functional integrity, and biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α [PGC1], nuclear respiratory factor 1 [NRF1], mitochondrial transcriptional factor [TFAM]) were analyzed in the retina from streptozotocin-diabetic rats maintained in poor or good control for 12 months (PC and GC respectively), or in PC for 6 months followed by 6 months of GC (Rev). The effect of direct inhibition of superoxide on prior insult was investigated by supplementing lipoic acid (LA) during their 6 months of GC (R+LA). Binding of TFAM with chaperones (heat shock proteins 70 and 60, Hsp70 and Hsp60 respectively) was quantified by coimmunoprecipitation. The key parameters and the number of mitochondria (by transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy) were confirmed in isolated retinal endothelial cell.
s of GC in the rats in Rev group did not provide any benefit to diabetes-induced decreased mtDNA copy number, increased gene transcripts of PGC1, NRF1, and TFAM, and decreased mitochondrial TFAM. The binding of TFAM with the chaperones remained subnormal. Supplementation of LA (R+LA), however, had a significant beneficial effect on the impaired mitochondria biogenesis, and also on the continued progression of diabetic retinopathy. Similar results of reversal of high glucose insult were observed in isolated retinal endothelial cell.
ted mitochondria biogenesis contributes to the metabolic memory, and supplementation of GC with therapies targeted in modulating mitochondria homeostasis has potential in helping diabetic patients retard progression of retinopath.
l apoptosis is essential for the resolution of inflammation but is delayed by several inflammatory mediators. In such terminally differentiated cells it has been uncertain whether these agents can inhibit apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of anti-death (Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1, Bcl2A1) or BH3-only (Bim, Bid, Puma) Bcl2-family proteins. We report that granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α prevent the normal time-dependent loss of Mcl-1 and Bcl2A1 in neutrophils, and we demonstrate that they cause an NF-κB-dependent increase in Bcl-X(L) transcription/translation. We show that GM-CSF and TNF-α increase and/or maintain mRNA levels for the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bid and that GM-CSF has a similar NF-κB-dependent effect on Bim transcription and BimEL expression. The in-vivo relevance of these findings was indicated by demonstrating that GM-CSF is the dominant neutrophil survival factor in lung lavage from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, confirming an increase in lung neutrophil Bim mRNA. Finally GM-CSF caused mitochondrial location of Bim and a switch in phenotype to a cell that displays accelerated caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. This study demonstrates the capacity of neutrophil survival agents to induce a paradoxical increase in the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Bim and suggests that this may function to facilitate rapid apoptosis at the termination of the inflammatory cycl.
ave the unique capacity to undergo two important root endosymbioses: the root nodule symbiosis and the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Medicago truncatula is widely used to unravel the functions of genes during these root symbioses. Here we describe the development of an artificial microRNA (amiR)-mediated gene silencing system for M. truncatula root.
enous microRNA (miR) mtr-miR159b was selected as a backbone molecule for driving amiR expression. Heterologous expression of mtr-miR159b-amiR constructs in tobacco showed that the backbone is functional and mediates an efficient gene silencing. amiR-mediated silencing of a visible marker was also effective after root transformation of M. truncatula constitutively expressing the visible marker. Most importantly, we applied the novel amiR system to shed light on the function of a putative transcription factor, MtErf1, which was strongly induced in arbuscule-containing cells during mycorrhizal symbiosis. MtPt4 promoter driven amiR-silencing led to strongly decreased transcript levels and deformed, non-fully truncated arbuscules indicating that MtErf1 is required for arbuscule developmen.
enous amiR system demonstrated here presents a novel and highly efficient tool to unravel gene functions during root endosymbiose.
 pathogens inflict large losses to agriculture annually and thus mechanisms of plant resistance and how to deploy them to enhance disease resistance in crops are foci of much research interest. We recently described the important role of ethylene and Ethylene Response transcription Factors (ERFs), particularly MtERF1-1, in mediating resistance to the fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani in the model legume, Medicago truncatula. Previous studies on the closely related AtERF14, a master regulator of ethylene dependent defenses including other ERFs, suggested that in Arabidopsis these defenses were not essential for resistance to the same R. solani isolate but were required for resistance to another fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum. Medicago plants with roots over-expressing MtERF1-1 were challenged with F. oxysporum but showed no altered resistance. These results further support a potential for divergent roles of ethylene associated defenses in different plant hosts responding to the same pathoge.
l necrotrophic pathogen Rhizoctonia solani is a significant constraint to a range of crops as diverse as cereals, canola, and legumes. Despite wide-ranging germplasm screens in many of these crops, no strong genetic resistance has been identified, suggesting that alternative strategies to improve resistance are required. In this study, we characterize moderate resistance to R. solani anastomosis group 8 identified in Medicago truncatula. The activity of the ethylene- and jasmonate-responsive GCC box promoter element was associated with moderate resistance, as was the induction of the B-3 subgroup of ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs). Genes of the B-1 subgroup showed no significant response to R. solani infection. Overexpression of a B-3 ERF, MtERF1-1, in Medicago roots increased resistance to R. solani as well as an oomycete root pathogen, Phytophthora medicaginis, but not root knot nematode. These results indicate that targeting specific regulators of ethylene defense may enhance resistance to an important subset of root pathogens. We also demonstrate that overexpression of MtERF1-1 enhances disease resistance without apparent impact on nodulation in the A17 background, while overexpression in sickle reduced the hypernodulation phenotype. This suggests that under normal regulation of nodulation, enhanced resistance to root diseases can be uncoupled from symbiotic plant-microbe interactions in the same tissue and that ethylene/ERF regulation of nodule number is distinct from the defenses regulated by B-3 ERFs. Furthermore, unlike the stunted phenotype previously described for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ubiquitously overexpressing B-3 ERFs, overexpression of MtERF1-1 in M. truncatula roots did not show adverse effects on plant developmen.
ivated kinase 1 (TAK1 or MAP3K7) is an intracellular hub molecule that regulates both nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that play key roles in development, cell survival, immune response, metabolism, and carcinogenesis. TAK1 activity is tightly regulated by its binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2/TAB3, as well as by post-translational modification including ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that TAK1 plays a role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis as a tumor prompter or tumor suppressor. An understanding of the role of TAK1 in liver physiology and diseases is required for the development of therapeutic agencies targeting TAK1. In this review, we highlight the activation mechanism and pathophysiological roles of TAK1 in the live.
e/stress signaling kinase Tak1 (Map3k7) deficiency is known to impair hematopoietic progenitor cells. However, the role of TAK1 signaling in the stem cell function of the hematopoietic system is not yet well defined. Here we characterized hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) harboring deletion of Tak1 and its activators, Tak1 binding proteins 1 and 2 (Tab1 and Tab2) using a competitive transplantation assay in a mouse model. Tak1 single or Tab1/Tab2 double deletions completely eliminated the reconstitution activity of HSCs, whereas Tab1 or Tab2 single deletion did not cause any abnormality. Tak1 single or Tab1/Tab2 double deficient lineage-negative, Sca-1(+), c-Kit(+) (LSK) cells did not proliferate and underwent cell death. We found that Tnfr1 deficiency restored the reconstitution activity of Tak1 deficient bone marrow cells for 6-18 weeks. However, the reconstitution activity of Tak1- and Tnfr1-double deficient bone marrow cells declined over the long term, and the number of phenotypically identified long-term hematopoietic stem cells were diminished. Our results indicate that TAB1- or TAB2-dependent activation of TAK1 is required for maintenance of the hematopoietic system through two mechanisms: one is prevention of TNF-dependent cell death and the other is TNF-independent maintenance of long-term HS.
accharide (LPS)-induced activation of TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) is followed by a subsequent overwhelming inflammatory response, a hallmark of the first phase of sepsis. Therefore, counteracting excessive innate immunity by autophagy is important to contribute to the termination of inflammation. However, the exact molecular details of this interplay are only poorly understood. Here, we show that PELI3/Pellino3 (pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffold protein in TLR4-signaling, is impacted by autophagy in macrophages (MΦ) after LPS stimulation. We noticed an attenuated mRNA expression of proinflammatory Il1b (interleukin 1, β) in Peli3 knockdown murine MΦ in response to LPS treatment. The autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) emerged as a potential PELI3 binding partner in TLR4-signaling. siRNA targeting Sqstm1 and Atg7 (autophagy related 7), pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin as well as blocking the lysosomal vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase by bafilomycin A1 augmented PELI3 protein levels, while inhibition of the proteasome had no effect. Consistently, treatment to induce autophagy by MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase)) inhibition or starvation enhanced PELI3 degradation and reduced proinflammatory Il1b expression. PELI3 was found to be ubiquitinated upon LPS stimulation and point mutation of PELI3-lysine residue 316 (Lys316Arg) attenuated Torin2-dependent degradation of PELI3. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PELI3 colocalized with the typical autophagy markers MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β) and LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2). Our observations suggest that autophagy causes PELI3 degradation during TLR4-signaling, thereby impairing the hyperinflammatory phase during sepsi.
d necrosis (necroptosis) plays an important role in development, tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that regulate necroptosis in the heart and its physiological relevance in myocardial remodeling and heart failure remain largely unknow.
identified an obligate function for TAK1 (transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1, gene name Map3k7) in regulating necroptotic myocyte death, myocardial remodeling, and heart failure propensity. Cardiac-specific ablation of Map3k7 in mice induced spontaneous apoptosis and necroptosis that led to adverse remodeling and heart failure, and these effects were abolished by ablation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1. Mechanistically, TAK1 functions as a molecular switch in tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 signaling by regulating the formation of 2 cell death complexes, RIP 1 (receptor-interacting protein 1)-FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain)-caspase 8 and RIP1-RIP3, a process that is dependent on FADD and caspase 8 as scaffolding molecules. Importantly, inhibition of RIP1 or RIP3 largely blocked necroptotic cell death, adverse remodeling, and heart failure in TAK1-deficient mic.
ults indicate that TAK1 functions as a key survival factor in the heart by directly antagonizing necroptosis, which is critical for the maintenance of myocardial homeostasis and the prevention of adverse myocardial remodelin.
's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive midbrain dopaminergic neuron degeneration and the formation of intracellular protein aggregates, referred to as Lewy bodies. F-box only protein 7 (FBXO7) gene mutations are closely associated with progression of the autosomal recessive form of familial PD. FBXO7 encodes a component of Skp1, cullin, F-box ubiquitin ligase complexes; however, its cellular targets, including substrates and regulators, are not yet clarified. To identify potential substrates of FBXO7, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain library and identified neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE protein (NRAGE) as a novel FBXO7-binding partner. We found that FBXO7 interacts with NRAGE and mediates Lys-63-linked poly-ubiquitination of NRAGE in mammalian cells. FBXO7 overexpression accelerates formation of NRAGE-TAK1-TAB1 complexes, whereas FBXO7 knockdown correspondingly decreases complex formation. In addition, BMP4 stimulation enhances NRAGE ubiquitination through FBXO7 and facilitates endogenous NRAGE-TAK1-TAB1 complex formation. Furthermore, FBXO7 positively regulates formation of the BMP receptor-NRAGE-TAK1-TAB1 complex, and up-regulates NF-κB activity. Taken together, our results suggest that FBXO7 affects BMP4-mediated signaling through proteasome-independent ubiquitination of NRAGE and augments formation of downstream signaling component.
n of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent signaling leads to the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and this proinflammatory gene expression is sustained for the duration of the inflammatory response. TLR4-mediated inflammation, which occurs in two phases, depends on the TNF family member 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) to sustain TNF-α production during late-phase signaling. We showed that Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and the kinase IRAK2 interacted with 4-1BBL to mediate late-phase TLR4 signaling. Expression of 4-1bbl depended on early TLR4 signaling that also induced Tnf expression, and 4-1BBL translocated to the plasma membrane, where it interacted with TLR4 to mediate late-phase signaling. TLR4-4-1BBL-mediated signaling depended on TIRAP and IRAK2, as well as a complex consisting of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), the kinase TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1), and the adaptor protein TAB1 (TAK-binding protein 1). Inhibition of this late-phase pathway reduced the extent of TNF-α production by mouse macrophages exposed to the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ameliorated LPS-induced sepsis in mice. Together, these data suggest that TIRAP and IRAK2 are critical for the sustained inflammatory response that is mediated by late-phase signaling by the TLR-4-1BBL comple.
ing growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase that is involved in diverse biological roles across species. Functioning downstream of TGF-β and BMP signaling, TAK1 mediates the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway, serves as the target of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, mediates NF-κβ activation, and plays a role in Wnt/Fz signaling in mesenchymal stem cells. Expression of TAK1 in the cochlea has not been defined. Data mining of previously published murine cochlear gene expression databases indicated that TAK1, along with TAK1 interacting proteins 1 (TAB1), and 2 (TAB2), is expressed in the developing and adult cochlea. The expression of TAK1 in the developing cochlea was confirmed using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Immunolabeling of TAK1 in embryonic, neonatal, and mature cochleas via DAB chromogenic and fluorescent immunohistochemistry indicated that TAK1 is broadly expressed in both the developing otocyst and periotic mesenchyme at E12.5 but becomes more restricted to specific types of supporting cells as the organ of Corti matures. By P1, TAK1 immunolabeling is found in cells of the stria vascularis, hair cells, supporting cells, and Kölliker's organ. By P16, TAK1 labeling is limited to cochlear supporting cells. In the adult cochlea, TAK1 immunostaining is only present in the cytoplasm of Deiters' cells, pillar cells, inner phalangeal cells, and inner border cells, with no expression in any other cochlear cell types. While the role of TAK1 in the inner ear is unclear, TAK1 expression may be used as a novel marker for specific sub-populations of supporting cell.
 to transforming growth factor beta and multiple cytokines involve activation of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) kinase, which activates kinases IkappaB kinase (IKK) and MKK3/6, leading to the parallel activation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK. Activation of TAK1 by autophosphorylation is known to involve three different TAK1-binding proteins (TABs). Here we report a protein phosphatase subunit known as type 2A phosphatase-interacting protein (TIP) that also acts as a TAB because it co-precipitates with and directly binds to TAK1, enhances TAK1 autophosphorylation at unique sites, and promotes TAK1 phosphorylation of IKKbeta and signaling to NF-kappaB. Mass spectrometry demonstrated that co-expression of TAB4 protein significantly increased phosphorylation of four sites in TAK1, in a linker region between the kinase and TAB2/3 binding domains, and two sites in TAB1. Recombinant GST-TAB4 bound in an overlay assay directly to inactive TAK1 and activated TAK1 but not TAK1 phosphorylated in the linker sites, suggesting a bind and release mechanism. In kinase assays using TAK1 immune complexes, added GST-TAB4 selectively stimulated IKK phosphorylation. TAB4 co-precipitated polyubiquitinated proteins dependent on a Phe-Pro motif that was required to enhance phosphorylation of TAK1. TAB4 mutated at Phe-Pro dominantly interfered with IL-1beta activation of NF-kappaB involving IKK-dependent but not p38 MAPK-dependent signaling. The results show that TAB4 binds TAK1 and polyubiquitin chains to promote specific sites of phosphorylation in TAK1-TAB1, which activates IKK signaling to NF-kappa.
interacting protein (RIP) plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation and subsequent activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB. However, the molecular mechanism by which RIP mediates TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation is not completely defined. In this study, we have found that TAK1 is recruited to the TNF-alpha receptor complex in a RIP-dependent manner following the stimulation of TNF-alpha receptor 1 (TNF-R1). Moreover, a forced recruitment of TAK1 to TNF-R1 in the absence of RIP is sufficient to mediate TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, indicating that the major function of RIP is to recruit its downstream kinases to the TNF-R1 complex. Interestingly, we also find that TAK1 and MEKK3 form a functional complex, in which TAK1 regulates autophosphorylation of MEKK3. The TAK1-mediated regulation of MEKK3 phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase activity of TAK1. Although TAK1-MEKK3 interaction is not affected by overexpressed TAB1, TAB1 is required for TAK1 activation and subsequent MEKK3 phosphorylation. Together, we conclude that TAK1 is recruited to the TNF-R1 complex via RIP and likely cooperates with MEKK3 to activate NF-kappaB in TNF-alpha signalin.
ation of NF-kappaB and IKK requires an upstream kinase complex consisting of TAK1 and adaptor proteins such as TAB1, TAB2, or TAB3. TAK1 is in turn activated by TRAF6, a RING domain ubiquitin ligase that facilitates the synthesis of lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Here we present evidence that TAB2 and TAB3 are receptors that bind preferentially to lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains through a highly conserved zinc finger (ZnF) domain. Mutations of the ZnF domain abolish the ability of TAB2 and TAB3 to bind polyubiquitin chains, as well as their ability to activate TAK1 and IKK. Significantly, replacement of the ZnF domain with a heterologous ubiquitin binding domain restored the ability of TAB2 and TAB3 to activate TAK1 and IKK. We also show that TAB2 binds to polyubiquitinated RIP following TNFalpha stimulation. These results indicate that polyubiquitin binding domains represent a new class of signaling domains that regulate protein kinase activity through a nonproteolytic mechanis.
poptotic properties of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins have been linked to caspase inhibition. We have previously described an alternative mechanism of XIAP inhibition of apoptosis that depends on the selective activation of JNK1. Here we report that two other members of the IAP family, NAIP and ML-IAP, both activate JNK1. Expression of catalytically inactive JNK1 blocks NAIP and ML-IAP protection against ICE- and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, indicating that JNK1 activation is necessary for the antiapoptotic effect of these proteins. The MAP3 kinase, TAK1, appears to be an essential component of this antiapoptotic pathway since IAP-mediated activation of JNK1, as well as protection against TNF-alpha- and ICE-induced apoptosis, is inhibited when catalytically inactive TAK1 is expressed. In addition, XIAP, NAIP, and JNK1 bind to TAK1. Importantly, expression of catalytically inactive TAK1 did not affect XIAP inhibition of caspase activity. These data suggest that XIAP's antiapoptotic activity is achieved by two separate mechanisms: one requiring TAK1-dependent JNK1 activation and the second involving caspase inhibitio.
 of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) are the target of extensive research in the field of cancer therapy since they regulate apoptosis and cell survival. Smac-mimetics, the most promising IAP-targeting compounds specifically recognize the IAP-BIR3 domain and promote apoptosis, competing with caspases for IAP binding. Furthermore, Smac-mimetics interfere with the NF-κB survival pathway, inducing cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation through an auto-ubiquitination process. It has been shown that the XIAP-BIR1 (X-BIR1) domain is involved in the interaction with TAB1, an upstream adaptor for TAK1 kinase activation, which in turn couples with the NF-κB survival pathway. Preventing X-BIR1 dimerization abolishes XIAP-mediated NF-κB activation, thus implicating a proximity-induced mechanism for TAK1 activation. In this context, in a systematic search for a molecule capable of impairing X-BIR1/TAB1 assembly, we identified the compound NF023. Here we report the crystal structure of the human X-BIR1 domain in the absence and in the presence of NF023, as a starting concept for the design of novel BIR1-specific compounds acting synergistically with existing pro-apoptotic drugs in cancer therap.
n apoptosis regulation are one main cause of cancer development and may result from overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). IAPs are cell death regulators that, among other functions, bind caspases, and interfere with apoptotic signaling via death receptors or intrinsic cell death pathways. All IAPs share one to three common structures, the so called baculovirus-IAP-repeat (BIR)-domains that allow them to bind caspases and other proteins. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is the most potent and best-defined anti-apoptotic IAP family member that directly neutralizes caspase-9 via its BIR3 domain and the effector caspases-3 and -7 via its BIR2 domain. A natural inhibitor of XIAP is SMAC/Diablo, which is released from mitochondria in apoptotic cells and displaces bound caspases from the BIR2/BIR3 domains of XIAP thereby reactivating cell death execution. The central apoptosis-inhibitory function of XIAP and its overexpression in many different types of advanced cancers have led to significant efforts to identify therapeutics that neutralize its anti-apoptotic effect. Most of these drugs are chemical derivatives of the N-terminal part of SMAC/Diablo. These &quot;SMAC-mimetics&quot; either specifically induce apoptosis in cancer cells or act as drug-sensitizers. Several &quot;SMAC-mimetics&quot; are currently tested by the pharmaceutical industry in Phase I and Phase II trials. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in understanding the function of IAPs in normal and malignant cells and focus on approaches to specifically neutralize XIAP in cancer cell.
ated protein kinase (AMPK) promotes glucose transport, maintains ATP stores, and prevents injury and apoptosis during ischemia. AMPK has several direct molecular targets in the heart but also may interact with other stress-signaling pathways. This study examined the role of AMPK in the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In isolated heart muscles, the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxy-amide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) increased p38 MAPK activation. In AMPK-deficient mouse hearts, expressing a kinase-dead (KD) alpha2 catalytic subunit, p38 MAPK activation was markedly reduced during low-flow ischemia (2.3- versus 7-fold in wild-type hearts, P&lt;0.01) and was similarly reduced during severe no-flow ischemia in KD hearts (P&lt;0.01 versus ischemic wild type). Knockout of the p38 MAPK upstream kinase, MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3), did not affect ischemic activation of either AMPK or p38 MAPK in transgenic mkk3(-/-) mouse hearts. Ischemia increased p38 MAPK recruitment to transforming growth factor-beta-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), a scaffold protein that promotes p38 MAPK autophosphorylation. Moreover, TAB1 was associated with the alpha2 catalytic subunit of AMPK. p38 MAPK recruitment to TAB1/AMPK complexes required AMPK activation and was reduced in ischemic AMPK-deficient transgenic mouse hearts. The potential role of p38 MAPK in mediating the downstream action of AMPK to promote glucose transport was also assessed. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 partially inhibited both AICAR- and hypoxia-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. Activation of p38 MAPK by anisomycin also increased glucose transport in heart muscles. Thus, AMPK has an important role in promoting p38 MAPK activation in the ischemic heart by inducing p38 MAPK autophosphorylation through interaction with the scaffold protein TAB.
reviously shown that transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1))-induced apoptosis in FaO hepatoma cells is mediated by cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, and caspase activation. Although TGF-beta(1) acts via the SMAD signaling pathway to initiate de novo gene transcription, little is known about the downstream gene targets that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Therefore, in this study, we used in-house microarrays (approximately 5500 genes) to identify pathway-specific gene clustering in TGF-beta(1)-treated cells. A total of 142 genes showed time-dependent changes in expression during TGF-beta(1)-induced apoptosis. The polycaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, which, on its own, had no effect on gene transcription, blocked TGF-beta(1)-induced cell death and significantly altered the expression of 261 genes, including 185 down-regulated genes. Cluster analysis identified up-regulation of early response genes (0-4 h) encoding for the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, including the pro-apoptotic CTGF gene, and delayed response genes (8-16 h), including pro-apoptotic genes. A second delayed response cluster (44 genes) was also observed when TGF-beta(1)-induced caspase activation was blocked by benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. This cluster included genes encoding stress-related proteins (e.g. Jun, ATF3, TAB1, and TANK), suggesting that their up-regulation may be in response to secondary necrosis. Finally, we identified an early response set of nine down-regulated genes that are involved in antioxidant defense. We propose that the regulation of these genes by TGF-beta(1) could provide a molecular mechanism for the observed elevation in reactive oxygen species after TGF-beta(1) treatment and may represent the primary mechanism through which TGF-beta(1) initiates apoptosi.
ter pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is generally accepted as a low-toxicity virulence. Primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells expressed the Toll-like receptor 4 and were sensitive to H. pylori LPS as well as Escherichia coli LPS. H. pylori LPS stimulated phosphorylation of transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) 2. H. pylori LPS at &gt;2.1 endotoxin unit/ml (&gt;1 ng/ml) activated caspase-8, stimulated cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and subsequently activated caspases-9 and -3, leading to apoptosis. Epidermal growth factor blocked all of these apoptotic processes and inhibited apoptosis, whereas it did not modify the phosphorylation of TAK1, TAB1, and JNK2. A comparatively specific inhibitor of caspase-8 or -9 blocked apoptosis, whereas cytochrome c release was prevented only with a caspase-8-like inhibitor. Our results suggest that caspase-8 and mitochondria may play crucial roles in H. pylori LPS-induced apoptosis and that this accelerated apoptosis may be involved in abnormal cell turnover of H. pylori-infected gastric mucos.
se sequence of events that enable mammary tumorigenesis to convert transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter remains incompletely understood. We show here that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (xIAP) is essential for the ability of TGF-beta to stimulate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells. Indeed whereas TGF-beta suppressed NF-kappaB activity in normal mammary epithelial cells, those engineered to overexpress xIAP demonstrated activation of NF-kappaB when stimulated with TGF-beta. Additionally up-regulated xIAP expression also potentiated the basal and TGF-beta-stimulated transcriptional activities of Smad2/3 and NF-kappaB. Mechanistically xIAP (i) interacted physically with the TGF-beta type I receptor, (ii) mediated the ubiquitination of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and (iii) facilitated the formation of complexes between TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and IkappaB kinase beta that enabled TGF-beta to activate p65/RelA and to induce the expression of prometastatic (i.e. cyclooxygenase-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and prosurvival (i.e. survivin) genes. We further observed that inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of xIAP or expressing a mutant ubiquitin protein (i.e. K63R-ubiquitin) was capable of blocking xIAP- and TGF-beta-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Functionally xIAP deficiency dramatically reduced the coupling of TGF-beta to Smad2/3 in NMuMG cells as well as inhibited their expression of mesenchymal markers in response to TGF-beta. More importantly, xIAP deficiency also abrogated the formation of TAB1.IkappaB kinase beta complexes in 4T1 breast cancer cells, thereby diminishing their activation of NF-kappaB, their expression of prosurvival/metastatic genes, their invasion through synthetic basement membranes, and their growth in soft agar. Collectively our findings have defined a novel role for xIAP in mediating oncogenic signaling by TGF-beta in breast cancer cell.
 potent cytokine that plays a critical role in numerous cellular processes, particularly immune and inflammatory responses, programmed cell death, angiogenesis, and cell migration. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediate TNFα-induced cellular responses is a crucial issue. It is generally accepted that global DNA binding activity of the NF-κB avian reticuloendotheliosis viral (v-rel) oncogene related B (RelB) subunit is not induced upon TNFα treatment in fibroblasts, despite its TNFα-induced nuclear accumulation. Here, we demonstrate that RelB plays a critical role in promoting fibroblast migration upon prolonged TNFα treatment. We identified the two kinases IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IκB kinase β (IKKβ) as RelB interacting partners whose activation by TNFα promotes RelB phosphorylation at serine 472. Once phosphorylated on serine 472, nuclear RelB dissociates from its interaction with the inhibitory protein IκBα and binds to the promoter of critical migration-associated genes, such as the matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3). Further, we show that RelB serine 472 phosphorylation status controls MMP3 expression and promigration activity downstream of TNF receptors. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of RelB activity and reveal a novel link between selective NF-κB target gene expression and cellular response in response to TNF.
 two major pathways leading to induction of NF-κB subunits. The classical (or canonical) pathway typically leads to the induction of RelA or c-Rel containing complexes, and involves the degradation of IκBα in a manner dependent on IκB kinase (IKK) β and the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO. The alternative (or non-canonical) pathway, involves the inducible processing of p100 to p52, leading to the induction of NF-κB2(p52)/RelB containing complexes, and is dependent on IKKα and NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). Here we demonstrate that in primary human fibroblasts, the alternative NF-κB pathway subunits NF-κB2 and RelB have multiple, but distinct, effects on the expression of key regulators of the cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and protein stability. Specifically, following siRNA knockdown, quantitative PCR, western blot analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show that NF-κB2 regulates the expression of CDK4 and CDK6, while RelB, through the regulation of genes such as PSMA5 and ANAPC1, regulates the stability of p21WAF1 and the tumour suppressor p53. These combine to regulate the activity of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, leading to induction of polycomb protein EZH2 expression. Moreover, our ChIP analysis demonstrates that EZH2 is also a direct NF-κB target gene. Microarray analysis revealed that in fibroblasts, EZH2 antagonizes a subset of p53 target genes previously associated with the senescent cell phenotype, including DEK and RacGAP1. We show that this pathway provides the major route of crosstalk between the alternative NF-κB pathway and p53, a consequence of which is to suppress cell senescence. Importantly, we find that activation of NF-κB also induces EZH2 expression in CD40L stimulated cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia patients. We therefore propose that this pathway provides a mechanism through which microenvironment induced NF-κB can inhibit tumor suppressor function and promote tumorigenesi.
osuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) regulate a variety of biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, tissue repair, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and host defense. Aberrant expression of TGFβ1 and IL-10 has been associated with many types of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, as well as with many types of cancer and leukemia. Patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) have high levels of malignant CD4+ T cells expressing IL-10 and TGFβ1 that suppress the immune system and diminish the antitumor responses. The transcriptional regulation of TGFβ1 and IL-10 expression is orchestrated by several transcription factors, including NFκB. However, while the transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes by NFκB has been studied extensively, much less is known about the NFκB regulation of immunosuppressive genes. In this chapter, we describe a protocol that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze the transcriptional regulation of TGFβ1 and IL-10 by measuring recruitment of NFκB p65, p50, c-Rel, Rel-B, and p52 subunits to TGFβ1 and IL-10 promoters in human CTCL Hut-78 cell.
to discover the variation of microRNAs and genes associated with NF-κB signaling pathway between the healthy and the mastitis Chinese Holstein cows, Illumina Deep Sequencing and qRT-PCR are applied to detect 25 kinds of miRNAs (miR-16, miR-125b, miR-15, miR-29a, miR-23b, miR-146, miR-301a, miR-181b, let-7, miR-30b, miR-21, miR-223, miR-27b, miR-10a, miR-143, etc.) expression levels in blood samples and 14 genes (RelA, RelB, Rel, p105, p100, IκBα, IκBβ, IκBδ, IκBε, IκBζ, Bcl-3, IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO) relative expression levels in nine tissues. The total number of miRNAs is declining, and RelA, Rel, p105, p100, IκBα, IκBβ, IκBδ, IκBζ, Bcl-3, and IKKα expressions are rising in mastitis individuals. So, we suppose that NF-κB pathway is active in mastitis individuals as a result of the decrease inhibition of miRNAs. While in healthy ones, the NF-κB pathway is inactive, because of the miRNAs enhanced inhibition action. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of miRNAs on NF-κB pathway in mastitis Holstein cows needs further investigation. Moreover, due to obvious expression differences, some miRNAs, especially miR-16 and miR-223, may be used as new markers for the dairy mastitis prognosin.
one (P4)contributes to the maintenance of human pregnancy, in part by inhibiting activity of the human pro-labor genes CRH and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of P4 remain poorly defined. We have shown that in human placenta, the constitutively activated noncanonical nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway positively regulates CRH and COX-2, which is further stimulated by glucocorticoid receptor signalin.

fied PR isoform-A (PR-A) as the only isoform of PR produced in human placenta. PR-A levels were lower in term placenta than in midterm placenta. Depletion of PR-A by short interfering RNA derepressed inhibition of CRH and COX-2 by P4 and the synthetic progestin 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Overexpression of PR-A inhibited transcription of CRH and COX-2, which was further downregulated by treatment with P4 or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Such an inhibition was mediated by a negative functional interaction of PR-A with the activity of RelB/NF-κB.

itor-κB kinase-nuclear factor-κB (IKK-NF-κB) and epidermal growth factor receptor-activator protein-1 (EGFR-AP1) pathways are often co-activated and promote malignant behavior, but the underlying basis for this relationship is unclear. Resistance to inhibitors of IKKβ or EGFR is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Here, we reveal that both IKKα and β contribute to nuclear activation of canonical and alternate NF-κB/REL family transcription factors, and overexpression of signal components that enhance co-activation of the EGFR-AP1 pathway. We observed that IKKα and IKKβ exhibit increased protein expression, nuclear localization, and phosphorylation in HNSCC tissues and cell lines. Individually, IKK activity varied among different cell lines, but overexpression of both IKKs induced the strongest NF-κB activation. Conversely, siRNA knock down of both IKKs significantly decreased nuclear localization and phosphorylation of canonical RELA and IκBα and alternative p52 and RELB subunits. Knock down of both IKKs more effectively inhibited NF-κB activation, broadly modulated gene expression and suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Global expression profiling revealed that NF-κB, cytokine, inflammatory response and growth factor signaling are among the top pathways and networks regulated by IKKs. Importantly, IKKα and IKKβ together promoted the expression and activity of transforming growth factor α, EGFR and AP1 transcription factors cJun, JunB and Fra1. Knock down of AP1 subunits individually decreased 8/15 (53%) of IKK-targeted genes sampled and similarly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Mutations of NF-κB and AP1-binding sites abolished or decreased IKK-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter activity. Compounds such as wedelactone with dual IKK inhibitory activity and geldanomycins that block IKKα/β and EGFR pathways were more active than IKKβ-specific inhibitors in suppressing NF-κB activation and proliferation and inducing cell death. We conclude that IKKα and IKKβ cooperatively activate NF-κB and EGFR/AP1 networks of signaling pathways and contribute to the malignant phenotype and the intrinsic or acquired therapeutic resistance of HNSC.
sists of p50, p65 (RelA), p52, c-Rel, and RelB, and among them p65 is a representative protein to investigate the regulation and function of this signaling. NF-κB integrates inflammation and carcinogenesis and regulates the expression of a variety of genes in response to immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis. IκBα acts as an inhibitor of NF-κB through forming an inactive NF-κB/IκBα complex. Pokemon is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in different signaling pathways, playing a pivotal role in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, embryonic development, and maintenance. In this study, we found that p65 and IκBα are both novel regulatory targets of Pokemon. Ectopic expression of Pokemon in immortalized liver cells HL7702 enhanced p65 and IκBα expression, whereas silencing of Pokemon in hepatocellular carcinoma cells QGY7703 reduced cellular p65 levels. ChIP assay and targeted mutagenesis revealed that Pokemon directly binds to the element of -434 to -430 bp in p65 promoter and of -453 to -448 bp in IκBα promoter and stimulates luciferase reporter gene expression. Co-transfection of Pokemon with p65 or IκBα promoter-reporter notably enhanced their promoter activity. These data suggest that Pokemon activates the expression of both p65 and IκBα by sequence-specific binding to their promoters and plays a dual role in regulating NF-κB signalin.
f the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors regulate a variety of molecules involved in host defense against pathogens. A prominent role of NF-κB in innate and adoptive immunity is based on the regulation of inducible transcription of various genes whose products are essential components of the immune response such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Since the discovery of the five members of the NF-κB transcription factor family, RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52, considerable progress has been made toward better understanding how the different NF-κB homo- and heterodimers regulate such distinct subsets of target genes. All of the NF-κB molecules are activated by various infectious stimuli; however, there are still open questions related to the selective functions of individual NF-κB family members during a coordinated immune response to infection. Diverse parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania donovani, Leishmania major, and Trichuris muris have been reported to activate NF-κB signaling cascades, and a number of distinct parasite-derived molecules may actively interfere with the pathways that lead to NF-κB activation. In this review, we provide an overview on the role of NF-κB activation in leishmaniasis and discuss how individual NF-κB family members might perform their distinct and non-overlapping functions in the regulation of protective immunity to Leishmania infectio.
ymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a severe malignancy with no effective treatment. HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) play a major role in ATLL development, by interfering with cellular functions such as CD4(+) T-cell survival. In this study, we observed that the expression of Bfl-1, an antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, is restricted to HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and to T-cells expressing both Tax and HBZ proteins. We showed that Tax-induced bfl-1 transcription through the canonical NF-κB pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that Tax cooperated with c-Jun or JunD, but not JunB, transcription factors of the AP-1 family to stimulate bfl-1 gene activation. By contrast, HBZ inhibited c-Jun-induced bfl-1 gene activation, whereas it increased JunD-induced bfl-1 gene activation. We identified one NF-κB, targeted by RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p105/p50, and p100/p52, and two AP-1, targeted by both c-Jun and JunD, binding sites in the bfl-1 promoter of T-cells expressing both Tax and HBZ. Analyzing the potential role of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in HTLV-1-infected T-cell survival, we demonstrated that these cells are differentially sensitive to silencing of Bfl-1, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2. Indeed, both Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) knockdowns decreased the survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, although no cell death was observed after Bcl-2 knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bfl-1 knockdown sensitizes HTLV-1-infected T-cells to ABT-737 or etoposide treatment. Our results directly implicate Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in HTLV-1-infected T-cell survival and suggest that both Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) represent potential therapeutic targets for ATLL treatmen.
the onset of human labour there is an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandins, cytokines and chemokines in the fetal membranes, particular the amnion. This is associated with activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). In this study we characterised the level of NFκB activity in amnion epithelial cells as a measure of amnion activation in samples collected from women undergoing caesarean section at 39 weeks gestation prior to the onset of labou.
that a proportion of women exhibit low or moderate NFκB activity while other women exhibit high levels of NFκB activity (n = 12). This activation process does not appear to involve classical pathways of NFκB activation but rather is correlated with an increase in nuclear p65-Rel-B dimers. To identify the full range of genes upregulated in association with amnion activation, microarray analysis was performed on carefully characterised non-activated amnion (n = 3) samples and compared to activated samples (n = 3). A total of 919 genes were upregulated in response to amnion activation including numerous inflammatory genes such cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, 44-fold), interleukin 8 (IL-8, 6-fold), IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP, 4.5-fold), thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1, 3-fold) and, unexpectedly, oxytocin receptor (OTR, 24-fold). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the microarray data reveal the two main gene networks activated concurrently with amnion activation are i) cell death, cancer and morphology and ii) cell cycle, embryonic development and tissue developmen.
ts indicate that assessment of amnion NFκB activation is critical for accurate sample classification and subsequent interpretation of data. Collectively, our data suggest amnion activation is largely an inflammatory event that occurs in the amnion epithelial layer as a prelude to the onset of labou.
cription factors of the Rel/NF-κB family function as key regulators of innate and adoptive immunity. Tightly and temporally controlled activation of NF-κB-signalling pathways ensures prevention of harmful immune cell dysregulation, whereas a loss of control leads to pathological conditions such as severe inflammation, autoimmune disease, and inflammation-associated oncogenesis. Five family members have been identified in mammals: RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, and the precursor proteins NF-κB1 (p105) and NF-κB2 (p100), that are processed into p50 and p52, respectively. While RelA-containing dimers are present in most cell types, c-Rel complexes are predominately found in cells of hematopoietic origin. In T-cell lymphocytes, certain genes essential for immune function such as Il2 and Foxp3 are directly regulated by c-Rel. Additionally, c-Rel-dependent IL-12 and IL-23 transcription by macrophages and dendritic cells is crucial for T-cell differentiation and effector functions. Accordingly, c-Rel expression in T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) controls a delicate balance between tolerance and immunity. This review gives a selective overview on recent progress in understanding of diverse roles of c-Rel in regulating adaptive immunit.
 family genes are important transcriptional factors regulating vital activities of immunity response, but no Rel/NF-κB gene has been identified in amphioxus. In this study, we have not only identified and characterized a Rel-like gene from Brachiastoma belcheri, but also extensively studied the evolution of Rel gene subfamily. We found that: 1) the amphioxus genome contains an AmphiREL gene encoding a Rel/NF-κB homolog, and AmphiREL gene was involved in the innate immune response of LPS stimulation in amphioxus. 2) Gene synteny comparison and structure comparison suggested that AmphiREL is an orthologous gene of human RELB, and is a paralogous gene of human RELA and REL. 3) Structural changes of Rel subfamily proteins are diverse during the evolution process, and imply their functional diversity. 4) The Rel subfamily genes have undergone very strong purifying selection. Together, our results provide important clues for understanding the evolution and function of Rel subfamily gene.
ntal feature of the transcriptional response to an nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inducing stimulus is that the response is highly selective and limited to the activation of only a subset of potential NF-κB target genes. One major contributor to selectivity of the response is likely to be the capacity of different NF-κB dimers to regulate different sets of target genes. The NF-κB family of transcription factors consists of five proteins, RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52, which assemble into several homodimeric and heterodimeric species. Studies of mutant mouse strains have revealed that each family member, and perhaps each dimer, carries out unique functions in regulating transcription in cells of the immune system and in many other cell types. Dimer-specific functions can be conferred by selective protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, coregulatory proteins, and chromatin proteins. Unique DNA-binding specificities and affinities make additional contributions to selectivity of the response, with growing evidence that some NF-κB dimers can adopt different conformations and thereby function differently when bound to different DNA sequences. Despite significant advances, our knowledge remains limited and many years of additional work will be needed to fully understand how the dimer-specific functions of NF-κB contribute to transcriptional selectivit.
oid carcinoma of the endometrium (EEC) is treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Post-radiation recurrences are associated with increased risk of metastases. Comparison of the expression of genes important in the development and progression of EEC, and others involved in resistance to apoptosis and hypoxia and adaptation to radiation, was performed between post-radiation vaginal recurrences (PVRs) and primary EECs. We tried to reproduce the results by exposing an EEC cell line to hypoxia and radiatio.
tochemistry and tissue microarrays were used to compare 24 PVRs with 82 primary EECs. PVRs exhibited increased expression of p53 (P &lt; 0.0001), cytoplasmic FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) (P &lt; 0.0001), and Ki67 (P &lt; 0.0001), and nuclear staining for FLIP, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) family members (p50, P &lt; 0.0001; c-Rel, P = 0.0077; RelB, P = 0.0157), and β-catenin (P = 0.0001). Differences regarding p50, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and cytoplasmic FLIP were statistically significant when PVRs and primary EECs were matched for histological grade. Exposure of the EEC cell line to hypoxia induced nuclear expression of β-catenin, FLIP, and HIF-1α, as well as increased NF-κB activity. No changes in FLIP, HIF-1α or NF-κB were seen when cells were exposed to radiation. Nuclear expression of β-catenin was seen at 3 Gy, but not at 1 G.
olved in resistance to hypoxia are expressed in PVRs, and may play a role in the development of post-radiation recurrence.
-lysine (Glu-Lys) Maillard reaction mixture heated at 121°C for 60 min was processed by ultrafiltration, ethyl acetate extraction, and semi-preparative HPLC to recover a bioactive fraction, termed F3. F3, characterized by spectral analysis to contain three distinct components, inhibited NO and IL-8 by 70 and 61%, respectively, at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in inflamed Caco-2 cells induced by IFN-γ and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). F3 significantly (P &lt; 0.05) down-regulated several genes involved in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. These genes included the cytokine receptors, TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B; receptor-associated proteins, IRAK2 and TICAM1; the inhibitor κB kinase, IKBKE; the NF-κB inhibitor, NFKBIA; and the NF-κB subunits, REL, RELA, and RELB. F3 also down-regulated the NF-κB responsive genes IL-8, NOS2, and ICAM1, attenuated the gene expression of peroxidases such as DUOX1 and DUOX2, and relieved the down-regulated GCFHR that are involved in the biosynthesis of NO and TROAP, a gene suppressed by NO. The anti-inflammatory activity of F3 was mediated through multiple processes that included regulation of gene expressions involved in NF-κB signaling, the inhibition of IL-8 and iNOS translation, a decrease in NO synthesis and attenuating oxidative stress in inflamed Caco-2 cells. Our results show that MRP components have the potential to suppress inflammation in IFN-γ and PMA-induced Caco-2 cell.
ase activity of the paracaspase Malt1 contributes to antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation and lymphomagenesis. Malt1 activity is required for optimal NF-κB activation, but little is known about the responsible substrate(s). Here we report that Malt1 cleaved the NF-κB family member RelB after Arg-85. RelB cleavage induced its proteasomal degradation and specifically controlled DNA binding of RelA- or c-Rel-containing NF-κB complexes. Overexpression of RelB inhibited expression of canonical NF-κB target genes and led to impaired survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines characterized by constitutive Malt1 activity. These findings identify a central role for Malt1-dependent RelB cleavage in canonical NF-κB activation and thereby provide a rationale for the targeting of Malt1 in immunomodulation and cancer treatmen.
al stem cells (MSCs) are known to induce the conversion of activated T cells into regulatory T cells in vitro. The marker CD69 is a target of canonical nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signalling and is transiently expressed upon activation; however, stable CD69 expression defines cells with immunoregulatory properties. Given its enormous therapeutic potential, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of regulatory cells by MSCs. Peripheral blood CD3(+) T cells were activated and cultured in the presence or absence of MSCs. CD4(+) cell mRNA expression was then characterized by microarray analysis. The drug BAY11-7082 (BAY) and a siRNA against v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B (RELB) were used to explore the differential roles of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signalling, respectively. Flow cytometry and real-time PCR were used for analyses. Genes with immunoregulatory functions, CD69 and non-canonical NF-κB subunits (RELB and NFKB2) were all expressed at higher levels in lymphocytes co-cultured with MSCs. The frequency of CD69(+) cells among lymphocytes cultured alone progressively decreased after activation. In contrast, the frequency of CD69(+) cells increased significantly following activation in lymphocytes co-cultured with MSCs. Inhibition of canonical NF-κB signalling by BAY immediately following activation blocked the induction of CD69; however, inhibition of canonical NF-κB signalling on the third day further induced the expression of CD69. Furthermore, late expression of CD69 was inhibited by RELB siRNA. These results indicate that the canonical NF-κB pathway controls the early expression of CD69 after activation; however, in an immunoregulatory context, late and sustained CD69 expression is promoted by the non-canonical pathway and is inhibited by canonical NF-κB signallin.
s laevis embryonic development, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes mesoderm cell fate determination via Xnr (Xenopus nodal-related) expression. We have demonstrated previously that Rel/NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) proteins expressed in presumptive ectoderm limit the activity of Xnrs to the marginal zone of embryos during mesoderm induction, which assists to distinguish mesoderm from ectoderm. The mechanism of this regulation, however, is unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether Rel/NF-κB proteins are able to modulate mesoderm formation by mediating Wnt/β-catenin signalling. We determined that ectopic expression of XrelA or Xrel3 in the dorsal marginal zone perturbed dorsal mesoderm formation by down-regulating multiple Wnt/β-catenin target genes including Xnr3, Xnr5 and Xnr6. Ventral co-expression of XrelA or Xrel3 with either wild-type β-catenin or constitutively active β-cateninS37A abrogated β-catenin-induced axis duplication and attenuated β-catenin-stimulated reporter transcription. Lastly, we provide evidence that Xrel3, but not XrelA, can interact with β-catenin without affecting the association of β-catenin with other transcriptional co-activators in vitro. Both Xrel3 and XrelA, however, prevented the accumulation, in nuclei, of exogenously expressed and endogenous β-catenin in vivo. These results suggest that Rel proteins are able to bind β-catenin and attenuate β-catenin-mediated transcription by nuclear exclusio.
 is implicated in lymphocyte development, maturation, proliferation and survival. This inducible transcription factor is widely expressed by virtually all cell types. In mammals, the genes rela, relb, crel, nfkappaΒ1, and nfkappaB encode the five NF-kB protein family members RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, respectively, which form homo- and heterodimeric DNA-binding complexes capable of regulating target gene transcription of specific biological responses differentially. NF-kappaB regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes that play critical roles in innate and adaptive immune responses, is strongly linked to the inhibition of apoptosis, and contributes to tumor growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Parasites have targeted several parts of the NF-kappaB pathway, allowing them to interfere with the transcription of immune response genes. The biology of different parasites is critical in influencing the patterns and kinetics of NF-kappaB activity and thereby the development of subsequent immune response.
cal phenotype in sepsis that is observed as LPS tolerance is determined by silencing of pro-inflammatory genes like IL-1 beta (IL-1β). This study shows that facultative heterochromatin (fHC) silences IL-1β expression during sepsis, where we find dephosphorylated histone H3 serine 10 and increased binding of heterochromatin protein-1 (HP-1) to the promoter. In both human sepsis blood leukocytes and an LPS tolerant human THP-1 cell model, we show that IκBα and v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B (RelB) function as dominant labile mediators of fHC formation at the IL-1β promoter. Protein synthesis inhibition decreases levels of IκBα and RelB, converts silent fHC to euchromatin, and restores IL-1β transcription. We further show TLR dependent NFκB p65 and histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation binding at the promoter. We conclude that the resolution phase of sepsis, which correlates with survival in humans, may depend on the plasticity of chromatin structure as found in fH.
diated DNA demethylation mechanisms have been implicated in the process of memory formation. However, the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the regulation of Gadd45 gene expression during memory formation remain unexplored. NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) controls transcription of genes in neurons and is a critical regulator of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In silico analysis revealed several NF-κB (p65/RelA and cRel) consensus sequences within the Gadd45β gene promoter. Whether NF-κB activity regulates Gadd45 expression and associated DNA demethylation in neurons during memory formation is unknown. Here, we found that learning in a fear conditioning paradigm increased Gadd45β gene expression and brain-derivedneurotrophic factor (BDNF) DNA demethylation in area CA1 of the hippocampus, both of which were prevented with pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activity. Further experiments found that conditional mutations in p65/RelA impaired fear memory formation but did not alter changes in Gadd45β expression. The learning-induced increases in Gadd45β mRNA levels, Gadd45β binding at the BDNF gene and BDNF DNA demethylation were blocked in area CA1 of the c-rel knockout mice. Additionally, local siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-rel in area CA1 prevented fear conditioning-induced increases in Gadd45β expression and BDNF DNA demethylation, suggesting that c-Rel containing NF-κB transcription factor complex is responsible for Gadd45β regulation during memory formation. Together, these results support a novel transcriptional role for NF-κB in regulation of Gadd45β expression and DNA demethylation in hippocampal neurons during fear memor.
(miRNA) genes generally share many features common to those of protein coding genes. Various transcription factors (TFs) and co-regulators are also known to regulate miRNA genes. Here we identify novel p53 and NFκB p65/RelA responsive miRNAs and demonstrate that these 2 TFs bind to the regulatory sequences of miR-100, -146a and -150 in both mouse striatal and human cervical carcinoma cells and regulate their expression. p53 represses the miRNAs while NFκB p65/RelA induces them. Further, we provide evidence that exogenous p53 inhibits NFκB p65/RelA activity by reducing its nuclear content and competing with it for CBP binding. This suggests for the existence of a functional cross-talk between the 2 TFs in regulating miRNA expression. Moreover, promoter occupancy assay reveals that exogenous p53 excludes NFκB p65/RelA from its binding site in the upstream sequence of miR-100 gene thereby causing its repression. Thus, our work identifies novel p53 and NFκB p65/RelA responsive miRNAs in human and mouse and uncovers possible mechanisms of co-regulation of miR-100. It is to be mentioned here that cross-talks between p53 and NFκB p65/RelA have been observed to define the outcome of several biological processes and that the pro-apoptotic effect of p53 and the pro-survival functions of NFκB can be largely mediated via the biological roles of the miRNAs these TFs regulate. Our observation with cell lines thus provides an important platform upon which further work is to be done to establish the biological significance of such co-regulation of miRNAs by p53 and NFκB p65/Rel.
c ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the deadliest malignancies with an overall life expectancy of 6 months despite current therapies. NF-κB signalling has been shown to be critical for this profound cell-autonomous resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs and death receptor-induced apoptosis, but little is known about the role of the c-Rel subunit in solid cancer and PDAC apoptosis control. In the present study, by analysis of genome-wide patterns of c-Rel-dependent gene expression, we were able to establish c-Rel as a critical regulator of tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis in PDAC. TRAIL-resistant cells exhibited a strong TRAIL-inducible NF-κB activity, whereas TRAIL-sensitive cells displayed only a small increase in NF-κB-binding activity. Transfection with siRNA against c-Rel sensitized the TRAIL-resistant cells in a manner comparable to siRNA targeting the p65/RelA subunit. Gel-shift analysis revealed that c-Rel is part of the TRAIL-inducible NF-κB complex in PDAC. Array analysis identified NFATc2 as a c-Rel target gene among the 12 strongest TRAIL-inducible genes in apoptosis-resistant cells. In line, siRNA targeting c-Rel strongly reduced TRAIL-induced NFATc2 activity in TRAIL-resistant PDAC cells. Furthermore, siRNA targeting NFATc2 sensitized these PDAC cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Finally, TRAIL-induced expression of COX-2 was diminished through siRNA targeting c-Rel or NFATc2 and pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 with celecoxib or siRNA targeting COX-2, enhanced TRAIL apoptosis. In conclusion, we were able to delineate a novel c-Rel-, NFATc2- and COX-2-dependent antiapoptotic signalling pathway in PDAC with broad clinical implications for pharmaceutical intervention strategie.
e type 2 deiodinase (D2) is a major determinant of T₃ production in the central nervous system. It is highly expressed in tanycytes, a specialized cell type lining the wall of the third ventricle. During acute inflammation, the expression of D2 in tanycytes is up-regulated by a mechanism that is poorly understood at present, but we hypothesized that cJun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RelA) (the 65 kD subunit of NFκB) inflammatory signal transduction pathways are involved. In a mouse model for acute inflammation, we studied the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on mRNA expression of D2, JNK1, and RelA in the periventricular area (PE) and the arcuate nucleus-median eminence of the hypothalamus. We next investigated LPS-induced D2 expression in primary tanycyte cell cultures. In the PE, the expression of D2 was increased by LPS. In the arcuate nucleus, but not in the PE, we found increased RelA mRNA expression. Likewise, LPS increased D2 and RelA mRNA expression in primary tanycyte cell cultures, whereas JNK1 mRNA expression did not change. Phosphorylation of RelA and JNK1 was increased in tanycyte cell cultures 15-60 minutes after LPS stimulation, confirming activation of these pathways. Finally, inhibition of RelA with the chemical inhibitors sulfasalazine and 4-Methyl-N¹-(3-phenylpropyl)benzene-1,2-diamine (JSH-23) in tanycyte cell cultures prevented the LPS-induced D2 increase. We conclude that NFκB signaling is essential for the up-regulation of D2 in tanycytes during inflammatio.
cription factor NF-κB is a regulator of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, yet only IκBα was shown to limit NF-κB activation and inflammatory responses. We investigated another negative feedback regulator, IκBε, in the regulation of B cell proliferation and survival. Loss of IκBε resulted in increased B cell proliferation and survival in response to both antigenic and innate stimulation. NF-κB activity was elevated during late-phase activation, but the dimer composition was stimulus specific. In response to IgM, cRel dimers were elevated in IκBε-deficient cells, yet in response to LPS, RelA dimers also were elevated. The corresponding dimer-specific sequences were found in the promoters of hyperactivated genes. Using a mathematical model of the NF-κB-signaling system in B cells, we demonstrated that kinetic considerations of IκB kinase-signaling input and IκBε's interactions with RelA- and cRel-specific dimers could account for this stimulus specificity. cRel is known to be the key regulator of B cell expansion. We found that the RelA-specific phenotype in LPS-stimulated cells was physiologically relevant: unbiased transcriptome profiling revealed that the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was hyperactivated in IκBε(-/-) B cells. When IL-6R was blocked, LPS-responsive IκBε(-/-) B cell proliferation was reduced to near wild-type levels. Our results provide novel evidence for a critical role for immune-response functions of IκBε in B cells; it regulates proliferative capacity via at least two mechanisms involving cRel- and RelA-containing NF-κB dimers. This study illustrates the importance of kinetic considerations in understanding the functional specificity of negative-feedback regulator.
data suggest that NF-kappaB signaling is a key regulator of cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. However, identification of the components of this signaling pathway and of the NF-κB transcription factors that regulate wasting is far from complete. In muscles of C26 tumor bearing mice, overexpression of dominant negative (d.n.) IKKβ blocked muscle wasting by 69% and the IκBα-super repressor blocked wasting by 41%. In contrast, overexpression of d.n. IKKα or d.n. NIK did not block C26-induced wasting. Surprisingly, overexpression of d.n. p65 or d.n. c-Rel did not significantly affect muscle wasting. Genome-wide mRNA expression arrays showed upregulation of many genes previously implicated in muscle atrophy. To test if these upregulated genes were direct targets of NF-κB transcription factors, we compared genome-wide p65 binding to DNA in control and cachectic muscle using ChIP-sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of ChIP-sequencing data from control and C26 muscles showed very little p65 binding to genes in cachexia and little to suggest that upregulated p65 binding influences the gene expression associated with muscle based cachexia. The p65 ChIP-seq data are consistent with our finding of no significant change in protein binding to an NF-κB oligonucleotide in a gel shift assay, no activation of a NF-κB-dependent reporter, and no effect of d.n.p65 overexpression in muscles of tumor bearing mice. Taken together, these data support the idea that although inhibition of IκBα, and particularly IKKβ, blocks cancer-induced wasting, the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway is not required. In addition, the downstream NF-κB transcription factors, p65 and c-Rel do not appear to regulate the transcriptional changes induced by the C26 tumor. These data are consistent with the growing body of literature showing that there are NF-κB-independent substrates of IKKβ and IκBα that regulate physiological processe.
lation of NF-κB plays an important role in modulating transcriptional activity of NF-κB independently of inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins. For the p65 subunit, multiple phosphorylation sites have been mapped in and adjacent to both the N-terminal Rel homology domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain. Their impact on NF-κB-dependent transcription, however, has never been assessed at a broader level. In this study, we evaluate the importance of differential p65 phosphorylation on four serine acceptor sites in the Rel homology domain for the expression of an array of NF-κB-dependent genes in endothelial cells. We find that inhibition of p65 phosphorylation on these serine residues targets NF-κB activity to distinctive gene subsets in a κB enhancer element-specific context. We show that the phosphorylation-dependent alterations in gene and protein expression are reflective of the amount of p65 and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (p-RNAP II) bound to respective gene promoter regions. Depending on the gene subset, impaired gene expression was either a result of decreased p65 promoter recruitment or of a failure of bound p65 to recruit p-RNAP II. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that site-specific p65 phosphorylation targets NF-κB activity to particular gene subsets on a global level by influencing p65 and p-RNAP II promoter recruitmen.
of the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor family in T cell function has been well described. The c-Rel family member is of particular importance in initiating T cell responses to antigen and regulating activation of inflammatory cytokine genes, including the Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) genes. c-Rel is required for chromatin remodeling of these gene promoters, which involves depletion of histones from the promoters in response to T cell activating signals. These chromatin remodeling events precede transcriptional activation of the genes. The subsequent down-regulation of cytokine gene expression is important in the termination of an immune response and here we examine this process at the murine GM-CSF and IL-2 genes. We show that the cytokine mRNA levels rapidly return to basal levels following stimulus removal and this is associated with reassembly of histones onto the promoter. Histone reassembly at the GM-CSF and IL-2 promoters occurs concomitantly with depletion of RelA, c-Rel and RNA polymerase II from the promoters. Furthermore we show that transcriptional down-regulation and chromatin reassembly is dependent on depletion of c-Rel from the nucleus, and that this is regulated by the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα. The nuclear activation of c-Rel therefore not only regulates the initiation of GM-CSF and IL-2 gene activation in response to T cell activation, but also the termination of these gene responses following the removal of the activating signa.
y tested the hypothesis that transcription of immediate early genes is inhibited in T cells activated in μg. Immunosuppression during spaceflight is a major barrier to safe, long-term human space habitation and travel. The goals of these experiments were to prove that μg was the cause of impaired T cell activation during spaceflight, as well as understand the mechanisms controlling early T cell activation. T cells from four human donors were stimulated with Con A and anti-CD28 on board the ISS. An on-board centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of μg from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 h of activation demonstrated that μg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly, differentially down-regulated in μg. Importantly, several key immediate early genes were inhibited in μg. In particular, transactivation of Rel/NF-κB, CREB, and SRF gene targets were down-regulated. Expression of cREL gene targets were significantly inhibited, and transcription of cREL itself was reduced significantly in μg and upon anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation in simulated μg. Analysis of gene connectivity indicated that the TNF pathway is a major early downstream effector pathway inhibited in μg and may lead to ineffective proinflammatory host defenses against infectious pathogens during spaceflight. Results from these experiments indicate that μg was the causative factor for impaired T cell activation during spaceflight by inhibiting transactivation of key immediate early gene.
ar factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor family has been considered the central mediator of the inflammatory process and a key participant in innate and adaptive immune responses. Coincident with the molecular cloning of NF-κB/RelA and identification of its kinship to the v-Rel oncogene, it was anticipated that NF-κB itself would be involved in cancer development. Oncogenic activating mutations in NF-κB genes are rare and have been identified only in some lymphoid malignancies, while most NF-κB activating mutations in lymphoid malignancies occur in upstream signaling components that feed into NF-κB. NF-κB activation is also prevalent in carcinomas, in which NF-κB activation is mainly driven by inflammatory cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, however, in all malignancies, NF-κB acts in a cell type-specific manner: activating survival genes within cancer cells and inflammation-promoting genes in components of the tumor microenvironment. Yet, the complex biological functions of NF-κB have made its therapeutic targeting a challeng.
ear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) are Rel homology domain (RHD)-containing transcription factors whose independent activities are critically involved in regulating cardiac hypertrophy and failur.
ine the potential functional interaction between NFAT and NFκB signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes and its role in cardiac hypertrophy and remodelin.
fied a novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism whereby NFκB and NFAT directly interact and synergistically promote transcriptional activation in cardiomyocytes. We show that the p65 subunit of NFκB coimmunoprecipitates with NFAT in cardiomyocytes, and this interaction maps to the RHD within p65. Overexpression of the p65-RHD disrupts the association between endogenous p65 and NFATc1, leading to reduced transcriptional activity. Overexpression of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) or p65-RHD causes nuclear translocation of NFATc1, and expression of a constitutively nuclear NFATc1-SA mutant similarly facilitated p65 nuclear translocation. Combined overexpression of p65 and NFATc1 promotes synergistic activation of NFAT transcriptional activity in cardiomyocytes, whereas inhibition of NFκB with IκBαM or dominant negative IKKβ reduces NFAT activity. Importantly, agonist-induced NFAT activation is reduced in p65 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared with wild-type MEFs. In vivo, cardiac-specific deletion of p65 using a Cre-loxP system causes a ≈50% reduction in NFAT activity in luciferase reporter mice. Moreover, ablation of p65 in the mouse heart decreases the hypertrophic response after pressure overload stimulation, reduces the degree of pathological remodeling, and preserves contractile functio.
ts suggest a direct interaction between NFAT and NFκB that effectively integrates 2 disparate signaling pathways in promoting cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular remodelin.
rdial stress response to exercise is dependent on exercise intensity and thus understanding the molecular responses between various exercise intensity levels might aid in exercise prescription. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that mediates a variety of cellular processes including inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis and cell growth/development. NF-κB can be comprised of homo- and/or heterodimers formed from five distinct proteins: p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB. NF-κB is located in the cytoplasm and kept inactive by inhibitory proteins but following the exposure to a myriad of stimuli, an activated NF-κB dimer translocates to the nucleus and exerts transcriptional effects on upwards of 150 genes. To examine the activation of NF-κB in the myocardium following exercise, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 24) were exercised by treadmill running at 20&nbsp;m/min for 30&nbsp;min or 30&nbsp;m/min for 20&nbsp;min. At 0, 2, or 24&nbsp;h following exercise, animals were anesthetized, hearts excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of hearts were homogenized, protein concentrations determined and extracts assayed for NF-κB activation (DNA binding activity) using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Visual examination of EMSA autoradiographs revealed an enhanced NF-κB activation in the hearts from exercised animals when compared with non-running controls. Subsequent supershift analyses using antibodies specific for NF-κB subunits showed the higher intensity exercise was associated with p65 (RelA) in the activated NF-κB complex while the NF-κB complex in hearts from animals exercised at the lower intensity was comprised primarily of p50. These data suggest exercise is capable of activating myocardial NF-κB and that a threshold for the activation of specific NF-κB subunits may exis.
ons between the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of proteins (RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50 and p52) and DNA are vital for cells to function normally; for example, in the human myometrium, NF-kappaB-regulated pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-8 and COX-2 are associated with the onset of labour. NF-kappaB, however, regulates the expression of over 400 genes, although it is unlikely these would all be activated in concert by a single inducer. At present, defining the role of the NF-kappaB RelA:p50 dimer, which governs a number of inflammatory promoters, is at the forefront of the parturition research field. However, to over-look the function of other family members and how they may regulate alternative signalling networks within reproductive tissues, only serves to ensure we will never fully understand the molecular circuitry influenced by this family of transcription factors. Consequently this review highlights other mechanisms by which the NF-kappaB family of regulators have been shown to function in other systems and how they may readily translate to understanding the regulation underpinning human parturitio.
cription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is one member of a ubiquitously expressed family of Rel-related transcription factors that serve as critical regulators of many proinflammatory genes and immunomodulators. Nevertheless, the immunomodulatory potential of thymulin and its effect on NF-kappaB in vivo, and particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), is not well characterized. In this study, the role of endotoxin (ET/LPS) in regulating NF-kappaB was deciphered in various compartments of the CNS. Stereotaxic localization reverberated specific intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ET into the CNS, with or without pretreatment with ICV thymulin. Treatment with ET (1 microg for 45 min; ICV) upregulated the expression and nuclear localization of NF-kappaB(1) (p50), NF-kappaB(2) (p52), RelA (p65), RelB (p68) and c-Rel (p75) in the hippocampus (HC), an effect abrogated, in a dose-dependent manner, by ICV pretreatment (30 min) with thymulin. Thymulin modulated the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha in the HC by upregulating the cytosolic accumulation of IkappaB-alpha and downregulating its phosphorylation (pIkappaB-alpha). Further analysis of the DNA-binding activity revealed an upregulated activity in the HC relative to saline-constitutive expression of the RelA (p65) subunit, the specificity of which was determined by a mutant oligonucleotide of RelA and a cold, non-specific competitor. ET did not induce the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in the diencephalon (DE) or substantia nigra (SN) at various time points, when compared with baseline levels of expression. Intraperitoneal (IP) injections of ET (25 microg for 15 min) in vivo upregulated the expression of NF-kappaB subunits in the liver and reduced the cytosolic accumulation of IkappaB-alpha by inducing pIkappaB-alpha. Furthermore, IP pretreatment with thymulin followed by ICV injection of ET attenuated and reduced the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB in the HC. These results indicate that ICV injection of ET regulates the nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappaB subunits within specific compartments in the brain, an effect particularly localized to the hippocampus. Additionally, thymulin attenuated the ET-induced response, with particular involvement of the transduction pathway implicating IkappaB-alpha, the major cytosolic inhibitor of NF-kappaB. The in vivo molecular regulation of thymulin via the NF-kappaB pathway is critical to understanding the alleviating anti-inflammatory role of this nonapeptide and paving the way to unraveling pathways associated with neuroimmune interactions mediating proinflammatory signals in the CN.
actor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a dimeric transcription factor composed of five members, p50, RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, and p52 that can diversely combine to form the active transcriptional dimer. NF-kappaB controls the expression of genes that regulate a broad range of biological processes in the central nervous system such as synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and differentiation. Although NF-kappaB is essential for neuron survival and its activation may protect neurons against oxidative-stresses or ischemia-induced neurodegeneration, NF-kappaB activation can contribute to inflammatory reactions and apoptotic cell death after brain injury and stroke. It was proposed that the death or survival of neurons might depend on the cell type and the timing of NF-kappaB activation. We here discuss recent evidence suggesting that within the same neuronal cell, activation of diverse NF-kappaB dimers drives opposite effects on neuronal survival. Unbalanced activation of NF-kappaB p50/RelA dimer over c-Rel-containing complexes contributes to cell death secondary to the ischemic insult. While p50/RelA acts as transcriptional inducer of Bcl-2 family proapoptotic Bim and Noxa genes, c-Rel dimers specifically promote transcription of antiapototic Bcl-xL gene. Changes in the nuclear content of c-Rel dimers strongly affect the threshold of neuron vulnerability to ischemic insult and agents, likewise leptin, activating a NF-kappaB/c-Rel-dependent transcription elicit neuroprotection in animal models of brain ischemi.
 dimers of different subunit composition can activate distinct subsets of target genes in vivo, however, the role of DNA recognition in this specificity is not well understood. We set out to study the DNA-binding ability of RelB/p52, the least studied of all NF-kB proteins and the main transcriptionally active product of the alternative NF-kB signaling pathway. We searched for optimal binding sites for RelB/p52 by random site selection method, using full-length proteins expressed in eukaryotic cells. The subset of RelB/p52-binding sequences defines a consensus which is very similar to the classical RelA/p50 consensus. Importantly, each of these binding sites is also recognized by RelA/p50 heterodimer with comparable affinity, questioning the existence of RelB/p52-specific kappa B site.

er is one of the most common cancers in India and south-east Asian region consisting of more than 50% of all malignant tumors. Along with many known risk factors, infection of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with the development of oral cancer and is suggested to modulate host cell transcription. Reciprocally, cellular transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB and AP-1 are known to modulate the expression of viral and other genes involved in the development of cancer. In the absence of data on NF-kappaB in relation to HPV in oral cancer, we studied the DNA binding activity and expression pattern of NF-kappaB family of proteins in different stages of oral cancer and correlated with HPV infection that has been associated with better prognosis of the disease. A total of 110 fresh oral tissue biopsies were collected comprising 10 normal controls, 34 precancer and 66 oral cancer lesions prior to chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Diagnosis of HPV was done by both consensus and type-specific PCR. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, western blots and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to assess the binding activity and expression pattern of NF-kappaB family of proteins (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, RelB and Bcl-3) in oral tissue biopsies. Twenty seven percent (18/66) of the oral cancer biopsies showed the presence of HPV infection exclusively of high risk HPV type 16, which was primarily associated with the well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (WDSCC). We observed a high constitutive activation of NF-kappaB with concomitant upregulated expression of all the NF-kappaB members in oral cancer tissues. Expression of NF-kappaB components gradually increased as the severity of lesion increased from precancer to invasive cancer. NF-kappaB p50 was found to be the major DNA binding component, which is indicative of homodimerization of p50 subunits. Interestingly, in HPV16 infected oral cancers although p50 showed high binding activity, p65 also showed a partial involvement as evidenced in supershift assay. Both by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, a differential overexpression and nuclear localization of p50, p65 and partially of Bcl-3 were observed in HPV16 positive oral cancer patients that also showed an over-expression of p21. We therefore, demonstrate a constitutive activation and differential expression of NF-kappaB proteins, which change as a function of severity of oral lesions during development of oral cancer. The NF-kappaB DNA binding is primarily due to homodimerization of p50 but infection of high risk HPV promotes participation of p65 in NF-kappaB complex formation, leading to heterodimerization of p50/p65. We propose that the involvement of p65 in HPV infected oral cancer may be linked to improved differentiation and better prognosis of the disease when treate.
actor (NF)-kappaB is a family of seven structurally related transcription factors that play a central role in cardiovascular growth, stress response, and inflammation by controlling gene network expression. Although the NF- kappaB subunits are ubiquitously expressed, their actions are regulated in a celltype and stimulus-specific manner, allowing for a diverse spectrum of effects. For example, NF-kappalB is activated by cytokines, reactive oxygen species, bacterial cell wall products, vasopressors, viral infection, and DNA damage. Recent molecular dissection of its mechanisms for activation has shown that NF-kappalB can be induced by the so-called &quot;canonical&quot; and &quot;noncanonical&quot; pathways, leading to distinct patterns in the individual subunits activated and downstream genetic responses produced. The canonical pathway involves activating the IkappalB kinase (IKK) with subsequent phosphorylation-induced proteolysis of the IkappaBalpha inhibitors and consequent nuclear translocation of the Rel A transcriptional activator. Recent work using high-density oligonucleotide arrays have begun to systematically dissect the scope of the gene network under canonical NF-kappaB control and have yielded important insights into biological pathways controlled by it. This pathway controls expression of noncontiguous, functionally discrete groups of genes (&quot;regulons&quot;), whose temporal expression occurs in waves. Moreover, its mode of activation (oscillatory or monophasic) plays an important role in determining the spectrum of target genes expressed. By contrast, the noncanonical NF-kappaB activation pathway involves activating the NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK) to stimulate IKKalpha-induced phosphorylation and proteolytic processing of the 100-kDa cytoplasmic NF-kappaB2 precursor. Activated NF-kappaB2 then forms a complex with Rel B and NIK to translocate into the nucleus thereby activating a distinct set of genes. Although the noncanonical pathway has been most clearly linked to control of adaptive immunity, recent intriguing studies have implicated this pathway in viral induced stress response and in the metabolic syndrome. In this way, a single family of transcription factors can respond to diverse stimuli to regulate cardiovascular homeostasi.
e the mechanism of epimedium flavonoids (EF) in regulating immunosenescence via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) related signal transduction pathwa.
poptosis index (AI) of splenic lymphocyte in aged rats was monitored by flow cytometry, that of young rats was taken as control. (2) The differential expression profile of NF-kappaB related signals in aged rats allocated in the control group (aged rats, group A), the EF treated group (group B), the PDTC (a NF-kappaB inhibitor) treated group (group C) and the PDTC plus EF treated group (group D), was determined and the main significant molecules in them were analyzed with gene microarray of 96 genes related to NF-kappaB signal pathwa.
 apoptosis of T lymphocyte cell was seen in aged rats, and it was significantly suppressed in group B and D. In group B, 73 genes were up-regulated to different extent, including 10 of the NF-kappaB/Rel/IB gene family, transduction signal molecule member of NIK/IKK/I B/Rel/NF-kappaB, NF-kappaB regulatory target genes, trans-membrane receptors, transcription factors, and receptor protein, etc. But the up-regulation on NF-kappaB gene family could not be seen in group C and that on others were also alleviated, while in the group D, the NF-kappaB gene family and its related transduction pathway were still activated to some extent. The NF-kappaB gene family showed a markedly common feature after EF intervention, either used alone or in combination with PDTC, i.e. the significant upregulated NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, Rel B and I Bepsilon, and activated NIK/IKK/I B/Rel/NF-kappaB pathwa.
ppress the excessive apoptosis of splenic lymphocyte in aged rats and activate Rel/NF-kappaB/ I B/IKK and their signal transduction pathway to up-regulate NF-kappaB through adjusting I Bepsilon and I Balpha, which may be the essential mechanism of EF in rebuilding the immune homeostasis of T lymphocyte apoptosis and retarding immunosenescenc.
 here the first association between vitamin D-resistant rickets, alopecia, and type 1 diabetes in a child with compound heterozygous mutations in the VDR gene. Transfection studies suggest dissociated effects of VDR gene mutations on the regulation of genes involved in vitamin D metabolism and dendritic cell maturatio.
itamin D may play a role in the immune tolerance process, no patient has been reported to associate hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) and an autoimmune disease, and no attempt has been made to delineate the outcome of mutations of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) on the transcription of genes controlling immune toleranc.
ene was analyzed in a child with vitamin D-resistant rickets, total alopecia, and early childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. Patient's fibroblasts and COS-7 cells transfected with wildtype or mutant VDRs were studied for ligand-binding capacity, transactivation activity using two gene promoters [CYP-24, a classical 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive gene, and relB, a critical NF-kappaB component for regulation of dendritic cell differentiation], VDR-RXR heterodimers association to CYP 24 VDREs by gel mobility shift assays, and co-activator binding by Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay.
 compound heterozygous mutations (L263R and R391S) were identified in the VDR ligand-binding domain in this child. Both mutations significantly impaired VDR ligand-binding capacity but had dissociated effects on CYP-24 and RelB promoter responses to vitamin D. CYP 24 response binding to SRC-1 and RXR-heterodimer binding to CYP24 VDREs were abolished in L263R mutants but normal or partially altered in R391S mutants. In the opposite, RelB responses to vitamin D were close to normal in L263R mutants but abolished in R391S mutant.
 the first clinical association between HVDRR, total alopecia, and early childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. Mutations in the VDR ligand-binding domain may hamper the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated relB responses, an effect that depends on the site of the VDR mutation and cannot be anticipated from VDR ligand-binding ability or CYP-24 response. Based on these results, we propose to survey the immune function in patients with HVDRR, including those with moderate features of ricket.
of the Paramyxoviridae family of RNA viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is a leading cause of epidemic respiratory tract infection in children. In children, RSV primarily replicates in the airway mucosa, a process that alters epithelial cell chemokine expression, thereby inducing airway inflammation. We investigated the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14/NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the activation of NF-kappaB-dependent genes in alveolus-like A549 cells. RSV infection induces a time dependent increase of NIK mRNA and protein expression that peaks 12 to 24 h after viral exposure. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays indicate that NIK kinase activity is activated even more rapidly (within 6 h of RSV adsorption) associated with an endogenous approximately 50-kDa NF-kappaB2 substrate. Because NIK associates with IKKalpha to mediate processing of the 100-kDa NF-kappaB2 precursor into its 52-kDa DNA binding isoform (&quot;p52&quot;), the effects of RSV on NIK complex formation with IKKalpha and NF-kappaB2 were determined by coimmunoprecipitation assay. We find that NIK, IKKalpha, and both 100 kDa- and 52-kDa NF-kappaB2 isoforms strongly complex 15 h after exposure to RSV at times subsequent to NIK kinase activation. Western immunoblot and microaffinity DNA pull-down assays showed a parallel increase in nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the NF-kappaB2-Rel B complex. Interestingly, we make the novel observations that NIK also transiently translocates into the nucleus complexed with 52-kDa NF-kappaB2. Small interfering RNA-mediated NIK &quot;knock-down&quot; blocked RSV-inducible 52-kDa NF-kappaB2 processing and interfered with the early activation of a subset of NF-kappaB-dependent genes, indicating the importance of this activation pathway in the genomic NF-kappaB response to RSV. Together, these data indicate that RSV infection rapidly activates the noncanonical NF-kappaB activation pathway prior to the more potent canonical pathway activation. This appears to be through a novel mechanism involving induction of NIK kinase activity, expression, and nuclear translocation of a ternary complex with IKKalpha and processed NF-kappaB.
ss of spermatogenesis requires a delicate balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling to maintain optimal sperm output. A major transcription factor known to regulate numerous apoptosis-related genes is NF-kappaB. Here we show that mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, 1 g/kg) induces translocation of NF-kappaB subunits (p65, p50, and c-Rel) to germ cell nuclei in young rats (Postnatal Day 28) as early as 1 h after exposure. Immunohistochemistry of rat testes exposed to MEHP showed increased p50 and c-Rel presence in spermatocytes and spermatogonia. In addition, there was increased p65 nuclear positivity in Sertoli cells and germ cells after MEHP, while Rel-B localization was unchanged. These alterations correlated with increased nuclear NF-kappaB-binding activity after MEHP exposure, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays of whole-testis nuclear protein extracts. The increased activity of this transcription factor was associated with a transient protection of the seminiferous epithelium manifested as a decreased number of germ cell apoptotic nuclei measured by TUNEL assay 6 h after MEHP exposure. These results suggest that NF-kappaB is involved in the testicular response to MEHP-induced injur.
ppaB family of transcription factors regulates a wide variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. A tissue microarray was constructed from paraffin wax-embedded blocks from 95 endometrial carcinomas (EC), previously studied for microsatellite instability, as well as for alterations in PTEN, k-RAS and beta-catenin. Immunohistochemical evaluation included members of the NF-kappaB (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, Rel-B) and the IkappaB (IkappaBalpha, IkappaBbeta, IkappaBepsilon, Bcl-3) families, as well as putative targets of NF-kappaB such as Flip, Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1, and oestrogen and progesterone receptors. Results were correlated with the clinical and pathological data. Nuclear immunostaining for members of the NF-kappaB family was frequent in EC (p50, 20%; p65, 16.5-21.9%; p52, 9.3%; c-Rel, 48.9%; Rel-B, 15.7%); and it correlated with negativity for members of the IkappaB family in some cases. There was a statistically significant association between immunoreaction for p50 and p65 (p = 0.006), suggesting activation of the so-called 'classic form' of NF-kappaB, similar to that described in breast cancer. Bcl-3 nuclear immunostaining was detected in 60.7% of cases. The vast majority of p52-positive tumours showed Bcl-3 nuclear immunoreaction (p = 0.038). Immunostaining for putative targets of NF-kappaB was as follows: Bcl-xL, 76.2% (p = 0.001); Flip 43.0%; Cyclin D1, 64.79%. p65 immunostaining correlated with increased immunoreaction for steroid hormone receptors. No correlation was found between NF-kappaB nuclear pattern and the presence of microsatellite instability, or alterations in PTEN, k-RAS, or beta-catenin. These results suggest that the NF-kappaB and IkappaB families of genes may be important in endometrial carcinogenesis, by controlling apoptosis and cell proliferatio.
ytes can be activated by many different stimuli. However, the mechanisms responsible for the signaling and functional specificities of individual stimuli remain to be elucidated. Here, we have compared the contribution of the type 1 (p50-dependent) and type 2 (p52-dependent) NF-kappaB activation pathways to cell survival, proliferation, homotypic aggregation, and specific gene regulation of murine primary B lymphocytes. Whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and B cell activation factor (BAFF) mainly activate the type 1 or type 2 pathways, respectively, CD40 ligand (CD40L) strongly activates both. Rescue of spontaneous apoptosis is diminished in p52(-/-) B cells after BAFF stimulation and in p50(-/-)c-Rel(-/-) B cells after LPS stimulation. Interestingly, significant CD40-induced B cell survival is still observed even in p50(-/-)c-Rel(-/-)p65(-/+) B cells, which is correlated with the ability of CD40L to up-regulate Bcl-x(L) expression in these cells. CD40L- and LPS-induced B cell proliferation, as well as up-regulation of proliferation-related genes, however, are greatly reduced in c-Rel(-/-) and p50(-/-)c-Rel(-/-) B cells but are normal in p52(-/-) B cells. We have further demonstrated that both c-Rel and p52 are required for CD40-mediated B cell homotypic aggregation, which explains well why neither LPS nor BAFF has this function. Overall, our studies suggest that both type 1 and type 2 NF-kappaB pathways contribute to the gene expression and biological program unique for CD40 in B cell activatio.
overexpression of the c-rel protooncogene is associated with lymphoid malignancy, while c-rel deletion produces severe lymphoproliferative defects and immunodeficiency. To investigate the mechanism of c-rel-induced proliferation and cell cycle progression in B lymphocytes, we have compared signaling events elicited through the BCR in c-rel-/- and wild-type B cells. BCR stimulation of c-rel-/- B cells fails to induce proper cyclin expression, resulting in G1 phase arrest, but it is unclear whether these defects are in fact secondary events of decreased B-cell survival, since c-rel deletion also affects the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as bcl-xL. Here, we use the bcl-xL transgene to correct the viability of c-rel-deficient B cells, and show that the inhibition of apoptosis does not necessarily confer hyperproliferation of B cells activated through the BCR. c-rel-/- B cells still fail to enter the S phase despite improved survival by bcl-xL overexpression, suggesting that c-Rel-associated cell cycle progression is dependent on more than just enhanced cell viability. Overexpression of cyclin E protein, however, can cooperate with Bcl-xL to restore cell cycle progression to c-rel-/- B cells via induction of the cyclin-CDK/Rb-E2F pathway. Furthermore, we show that c-Rel can directly regulate transcription of the e2f3a promoter/enhancer, which is then likely to lead to transcriptional activation of the cyclin E promoter by E2F3a. Hence, these studies provide clear evidence that control of lymphocyte proliferation via c-Rel is linked to a cyclin-dependent process, and suggest that c-Rel not only activates antiapoptotic signaling but also the induction of cell cycle progressio.
opoietically restricted member of the NF-kappaB/Rel family, c-Rel, is essential for B cell survival and proliferation. Here we demonstrate that the production of the interleukins 6, 10, and 15 (IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15) are diminished in c-Rel(-/-) B lymphocytes. In a manner similar to that seen in IL-6(-/-) B cells, resultant STAT activation is reduced in c-Rel(-/-) B cells following B cell receptor (BCR) ligation. Addition of either exogenous IL-6 or IL-10, but not IL-15, partially restores proliferation, and this occurs through enhanced cell survival rather than promoting cell cycle progression. This increase in viability occurs independently of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression though, two survival genes reported to be downstream of IL-6 signaling. Nonetheless, transgenically expressed Bcl-xL, a direct c-Rel target gene in B cells, corrects not only the survival defect of c-Rel deficiency, but also partially ameliorates hypoproliferation. Together IL-6 and Bcl-xL are additive but incomplete in the restoration of proliferation. Known deficits in the induction of several key cell cycle components in c-Rel(-/-)B cells are not corrected upon treatment with exogenous cytokine. Together, these data demonstrate that IL-6 enhances B cell responses by employing multiple survival factor.
xpressed BCR mediates the proliferation and expansion of antigen-specific B lymphocytes during a humoral immune response. Although several studies extensively characterize BCR proliferative signaling, the mechanisms linking these pathways to the cell cycle remain elusive. Using knockout mice, we show that c-Rel, a proto-oncogenic member of the NF-kappaB transcription factor family, is essential to BCR-mediated proliferation and cell cycle progression. Splenic B cells obtained from gene-targeted c-Rel knockout mice display a defective proliferation response to antigen receptor cross-linking, resulting in G(1) arrest. At the molecular level, we see that BCR stimulation of resting c-Rel(-/-) B cells fails to induce proper cyclin D3 and cyclin E expression, thereby negatively impacting G(1) phase cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. c-Rel-deficient B cells also exhibit incomplete phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and poor expression of E2Fs, thus impeding the G(1) to S phase transition. Down-regulation of the pRb-related p130 protein during the G(0) to G(1) transition and removal of the CDK inhibitor p27(KIP1) in late G(1) parallel that of wild-type cells, suggesting that Rel-deficient B cells can exit the G(0) resting state and enter G(1) phase normally. Finally, we demonstrate that restoration of proliferation can be achieved partially upon reintroduction of cyclin E using a protein transduction method to reconstitute primary B cells. Collectively, these studies emphasize the importance of c-Rel in lymphocyte proliferation and oncogenesis, and highlight a requirement for c-Rel in establishing an effective humoral immune respons.
cytokine-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways are involved in muscle wasting subsequent to disease, their potential role in disuse muscle atrophy has not been characterized. Seven days of hind limb unloading led to a 10-fold activation of an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter in rat soleus muscle but not the atrophy-resistant extensor digitorum longus muscle. Nuclear levels of p50 were markedly up-regulated, c-Rel was moderately up-regulated, Rel B was down-regulated, and p52 and p65 were unchanged in unloaded solei. The nuclear IkappaB protein Bcl-3 was increased. There was increased binding to an NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotide, and this complex bound antibodies to p50, c-Rel, and Bcl-3 but not other NF-kappaB family members. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 protein were moderately down-regulated. There was no difference in p38, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase or Akt activity, nor were activator protein 1 or nuclear factor of activated T cell-dependent reporters activated. Thus, whereas several NF-kappaB family members are up-regulated, the prototypical markers of cytokine-induced activation of NF-kappaB seen with disease-related wasting are not evident during disuse atrophy. Levels of an anti-apoptotic NF-kappaB target, Bcl-2, were increased fourfold whereas proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak decreased. The evidence presented here suggests that disuse muscle atrophy is associated with activation of an alternative NF-kappaB pathway that involves the activation of p50 but not p6.
actor-kB (NF-kB), is a transcription factor composed of dimeric complexes of p50 (NF-kB1) or p52 (NF-kB2) usually associated with members of the Rel family (p65, c-Rel, Rel B) which have potent transactivation domains. Different combinations of NF-kB/Rel proteins bind distinct kB sites to regulate the transcription of different genes. In resting cells NF-kB resides in the cytoplasm in inactive form, complexed to members of a family of inhibitory proteins referred to as IkB. The bound IkB masks the NF-kB nuclear localization signal and thereby inhibits its nuclear transport. NF-kB can be activated by a variety of signals relevant to pathophysiology including inflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as well as oxidative and fluid mechanical stress. Upon activation by these stimuli, IkB is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded. Phosphorylation targets IkB for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome thus leading to NF-kB nuclear translocation. The same proteolytic pathway is involved in the processing of the p105 and p100 precursors to generate mature p50 and p52 subunits, respectively. Once in the nucleus, NF-kB is able to regulate the expression of many genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses (i.e. inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules). Thus, new approaches to modulating NF-kB activation, and as a consequence inflammatory or metastatic processes, may take advantage of the selectivity of the ubiquitination and ATP-dependent proteolytic processes leading to IkB turnover. This review will analyze the current strategies aimed at interfering with NF-kB activation and will consider the ubiquitination system as a new selective target for the development of new anti-inflammatory therapie.
cytes, the Rel transcription factor is essential in establishing a pattern of gene expression that promotes cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Here we show that mitogen-induced expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4), a lymphoid-specific member of the IFN family of transcription factors, is Rel dependent. Consistent with IRF-4 functioning as a repressor of IFN-induced gene expression, the absence of IRF-4 expression in c-rel(-/-) B cells coincided with a greater sensitivity of these cells to the antiproliferative activity of IFNs. In turn, enforced expression of an IRF-4 transgene restored IFN modulated c-rel(-/-) B cell proliferation to that of wild-type cells. This cross-regulation between two different signaling pathways represents a novel mechanism that Rel/nuclear factor kappaB can repress the transcription of IFN-regulated genes in a cell type-specific manne.
he development of insulitis and diabetes is predictable in Lyp/Lyp congenic BB rats, we have characterized early islet inflammation in these rats to determine the cell subsets involved in the onset of autoimmune insulitis. Pancreas sections from prediabetic Lyp/Lyp, Lyp/+ and +/+ rats were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We found W3/25+ cells in the exo- and endocrine tissue from all three genotypes, but intraislet insulitis was never found in Lyp/+ or +/+ rats. The onset of massive, intraislet B- and T-cell infiltration in Lyp/Lyp rats was preceded by Rel B+ cells in and around the islets, followed by ED1+ monocytes/macrophages. Rel B+ cells were more frequent in the parafollicular cortex of pancreatic lymph nodes from Lyp/Lyp than from Lyp/+ and +/+ rats. In the Lyp/Lyp thymus, we found significantly increased expression of IL-12p40 messenger RNA (mRNA; p&lt;0.001), located in the Rel B-protein-rich corticomedullary junction. The NF-KB/Rel B complex specifically transactivates genes involved in antigen presentation in dendritic cells. Rel B+ cells in the islets may therefore mark the onset of autoimmune insulitis and antigen-specific activation of autoreactive T cells in the lymph nodes of diabetes prone Lyp/Lyp BB rats. In the thymus, Rel B+ cells may support the Lyp-dependent development of self-reactive thymocytes by activation of cytokine expressio.
s spider evenomation in man frequently results in disfiguring necrotic skin lesions. Recent studies suggest that several proinflammatory mediators participate in lesion development. We have observed that Loxosceles deserta venom induces production of the chemokines interleukin-8, growth-related oncogene alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-I by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Members of the Rel/Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors are important regulators of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that Loxosceles-venom-induced chemokine expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells is mediated by NF-kappa.
ilical vein endothelial cell monolayers were exposed to activating concentrations of Loxosceles deserta venom. Nuclear extracts of these monolayers were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A direct cause and effect linkage between NF-kappaB activation and chemokine expression by Loxosceles venom was established through examination of the effect of SN50 on interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production using a whole-cell enzyme immunoassay. SN50 is a cell-permeable peptide that specifically blocks cytosolic to nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, the venom-induced synthesis of chemokine mRNAs was investigated by RNase protection assay.
s deserta venom induces the activation of NF-kappaB in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Antibodies to p50 and p65, but not to p52, c-Rel, or Rel B, induce supershifts of the DNA-protein complexes formed by oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extracts from venom-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. SN50 peptide inhibits NF-kappaB translocation and interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production in activated human umbilical vein endothelial cell.
s deserta venom induces synthesis of interleukin8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNAs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The expression of chemokines occurs via an NF-kappaB-dependent pathwa.
actor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a set of five polypeptide transcription factors, called p50, p52, p65 (also called Rel A), Rel B, and c-Rel, which regulate the expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. They were originally named because they were considered essential regulators of B cell kappa light chain expression. More recent studies indicate that NF-kappaB proteins are involved in the regulation of a variety of other cell functions, including cell proliferation, responses to stress, and apoptosis. NF-kappaB heterodimers reside in the cytoplasm of cells bound to inhibitory proteins, the two commonest of which are IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta, which prevent NF-kappaB from entering the nucleus. When cells are stimulated, IkappaB is phosphorylated by specific IkappaB kinases and subsequently is ubiquitinated and degraded in proteosomes. This allows NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus to regulate the expression of a growing list of genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor. IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor in turn also regulate the expression of NF-kappaB. Thus, once activated, NF-kappaB may be involved in upregulatory loops, which can amplify the effects of the initiating stimulus. Because these proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of estrogen deficiency and inflammation-related bone loss, it is likely that NF-kappaB has a significant role in the increased generation and function of osteoclasts in these circumstances. However, an unexpected and essential role of NF-kappaB in the formation of osteoclasts during development was discovered recently after the generation of knockout mice, which lack the expression of the p50 and p52 subunits. This paper will describe recent studies that reveal an essential role for NF-kappaB signaling in the generation of osteoclasts and that suggest that NF-kappaB may also play a key central role in the activation and survival of osteoclasts in conditions in which osteoclastogenesis is upregulate.
between-3134 and -2729 bp upstream from the transcription site of the human pro-interleukin 1beta (proIL-1beta) gene was identified as an LPS-responsive enhancer element. In this study, the influence of the sequences located between -3134 and -2987 on the transcriptional activity of the proIL-1beta gene in LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells was examined in detail. The results obtained by transient transfection of fos -CAT constructs that contained serial 5'-deletion mutations showed that the region between -3134 and -3059 appears to be required for the induction of transcription by LPS. Gel shift assay studies with synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to partial sequences of the latter region and nuclear extracts from stimulated cells revealed specific protein binding sites between -3110 and -3090 and between -3079 and -3059. These specific bindings were time and LPS dose dependent. The results of supershift analysis using specific antibodies against transcription factors suggested that both binding complexes contained the NF-kappaB components p50 and p65, and did not contain other NF-kappaB proteins (p52, c-Rel, Rel B), AP-1 proteins (c-Fos, C-Jun), CREB or C/EBPbeta (NF-IL6). Mutation of either of the putative NF-kappaB-binding sites in the enhancer element decreased the LPS-stimulated transcriptional activity. These data indicated that two NF-kappaB-binding sites, which are located between -3134 and -3059, are critical for the activation of proIL-1beta gene transcriptio.
actor kappB (NFkappaB) is a transcription factor that controls several genes important for immunity and inflammation. The aim of this study was to assess if activation of NFkappaB plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and whether steroid treatment affects NFkappaB activation. Activation of NFkappaB was analysed in colon biopsy samples of 13 patients with active IBD (8 Crohn's colitis, 5 ulcerative colitis) by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays, under basal conditions and 3 weeks after treatment with 0.75 mg kg(-1) day(-1) prednisolone. The presence of interleukin-8 mRNA in biopsies was assessed by RT-PCR. A specific NFkappaB band was present in all nuclear extracts from inflamed mucosa, whereas the band was barely detectable in uninflamed colonic mucosa. NFkappaB bands were super-shifted by antibodies against p50 subunit, whereas antibodies against p65, p52, c-Rel, or Rel B did not modify the mobility of the band. Increased interleukin-8 mRNA was detected at the same sites of NFkappaB activation. Steroid-induced healing of colonic inflammation was associated with disappearance of NFkappaB from nuclear extracts. These results support the notion that NFkappaB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and that blockade of NFkappaB activation is one of the mechanisms by which steroids suppress the inflammatory cascade in IB.
igate the function of alternative NF-κB activity in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL.
expression of individual NF-κB subunits in CD5⁺CD19⁺ cells (CLL B-cells) from bone marrow (BM) of 56 patients with B-CLL was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. An ELISA-based NF-κB family transcription factor activity assay was performed to quantify the κB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts from CLL B-cells. Cell death of CLL-B cells was determined by PI staining, RelA and RelB expression at protein level of CLL B-cells by Western blot analyse.
ssion levels of RelA, p50, RelB and p52 mRNA in CLL B-cells were all higher than that of normal B cells with statistical significance (P&lt;0.05). RelA was activated in almost all the patients detected while RelB activity was induced in part of samples. The average RelA activity in CLL B-cells was increased compared to that in normal B cells while the average RelB activity was similar to that of normal B cells. When cultured in vitro for 24, 48 and 72 hours, the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells from RelA⁺/RelB⁻ group were(35.54±4.43)%,(50.92±8.44)%, and(49.24±8.16)%, respectively; that of the RelA⁺/RelB⁺ group were (20.65±2.37)%, (18.17±1.36)%, and (26.55±4.08)%, respectively. When the cells from RelA+/RelB⁻ group were co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs), the frequencies of cell death of CLL B-cells were decreased compared to that of the cells cultured alone, while the frequencies of cell death of RelA⁺/RelB⁻ CLL B-cells were higher than that of CLL B-cells from RelA⁺/RelB⁺ group when co-cultured with hBMSCs. RelA and RelB expression in CLL-B cells from the RelA⁺/RelB⁻ group was induced after co-cultured with hBMSCs for 48 h. RelB was reduced in the cytoplasm and increased in the nucleus in CLL-B cells from the RelA+/RelB+ grou.
native NF-κB was indeed activated and presented heterogeneous in CLL B-cells from BM. Activation of RelB combined with RelA activity could provide the survival advantage to CLL B-cells from BM. Co-culture with hBMSCs could protect CLL-B cells through the induction of RelA and Rel B expression.
ine effects of (1) parenteral nutrition (PN), (2) exogenous Lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) stimulation in PN animals, and (3) exogenous LTβR blockade in chow animals on NF-κB activation pathways and products: MAdCAM-1, chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand (CCL) 19, CCL20, CCL25, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-1.
ates LTβR in Peyer's patches (PP) to activate NF-κB via the noncanonical pathway. The p100/RelB precursor yields p52/RelB producing MAdCAM-1, cytokines, and chemokines important in cell trafficking. TNFα, IL-1β, and bacterial products stimulate the inflammatory canonical NF-κB pathway producing p65/p50 and c-Rel/p50. PN decreases LTβR, MAdCAM-1, and chemokines in PP and lowers small intestinal IgA compared with cho.
 (p50 and p65) and noncanonical (p52 and Rel B) NF-κB proteins in PP were analyzed by TransAM NF-κB kit after 5 days of chow or PN, 2 days of LTβR stimulation or 3 days of LTβR blockade. MAdCAM-1, chemokines, and cytokines in PP were measured by ELISA after LTβR stimulation or blockad.
icantly reduced all NF-κB proteins in PP compared with chow. Exogenous LTβR stimulation during PN increased p50, p52, Rel B, MAdCAM-1, IL-4, and IL-10 in PP, but not p65, CCL19, CCL20, or CCL25 compared with PN. LTβR blockade reduced noncanonical products (p52 and Rel B), MAdCAM-1, CCL19, CCL20, CCL25, IL-4, and IL-10 but had no effect on the inflammatory pathway (p50 and p65) compared with cho.
nteral stimulation during PN decreases both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways in PP. LTβR stimulation during PN feeding completely restores PP noncanonical NF-κB activity, MAdCAM-1, IL-4, IL-10, and partly the canonical pathway. LTβR blockade decreases the noncanonical NF-κB activity, MAdCAM-1, chemokines, and cytokines without effect on the canonical NF-κB activity in P.
e show that γδT, CD8(+) αβT lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells display a different sensitivity to survival signals delivered via NKG2D surface receptor. All the three effector cell populations activate Akt1/PKBalpha through the engagement of this molecule. Upon binding to leukemic cells expressing NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including chronic lymphocytic leukemias treated with transretinoic acid, most γδT (&gt;60%) and half CD8(+) αβT cells (about 50%) received a survival signal, at variance with the majority of NK cells (&gt;80%) that underwent apoptosis by day 5. Interestingly, oligomerization of NKG2D in γδT or CD8(+) αβT cells, led to a significant rise in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of both NF-kBp52 and RelB, the two NF-kB subunits mainly involved in the transcription of antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl family. Indeed, the ratio between the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) and the proapoptotic protein Bax raised in γδT or CD8(+) αβT cells following NKG2D engagement by specific monoclonal antibodies or by NKG2DL expressing leukemic cells. Conversely, nuclear translocation of NF-kBp52 or RelB did not increase, nor the Bcl-2/Bax or the Bcl-x(L) /Bax ratios changed significantly, in NK cells upon oligomerizaton of NKG2D. Of note, transcripts for α5 importin, responsible for nuclear translocation of NF-kBp52/Rel B heterodimer, are significantly higher in γδT and CD8(+) αβT cells than in NK cells. These biochemical data may explain, at least in part, why γδT and CD8(+) αβT cells are cytolytic effector cells more resistant to target-induced apoptosis than NK cell.
ar factor-kappaB (NF-KB)/RelB transcription factor plays an essential role in development of some dendritic cell (DC) subsets in mice. In this laboratory, immature myeloid DC are produced in vitro in a stroma-dependent murine spleen long-term culture (LTC) system. In LTC, DC differentiate from hematopoietic progenitors maintained within the stromal cell matrix. Expression and function of RelB in development of LTC-DC has been investigated, with a view to assessing the relationship between DC produced in this system and other known subsets of D.
ession by LTC-DC was confirmed by detection of protein by Western blotting, RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and nuclear protein with DNA-binding function in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The role of RelB in cell development was assessed by addition of antisense RelB oligonucleotides into LTC and colony assays established above STX3 stromal cells. RelB(-/-) mice were also examined for ability to produce LTC, and for presence of DC progenitors in spleen and bone marrow that can generate DC when overlaid on STX3 in coculture.
l RelB was detected in both LTC-DC and in STX3 stromal cells. A critical role for RelB in DC differentiation from spleen progenitors was confirmed, because antisense RelB oligonucleotides specifically and completely inhibited production of large differentiated myeloid DC in LTC. Further investigation using RelB(-/-) mice revealed that RelB expression by stromal cells rather than hematopoietic cells was required for production of LTC-DC. This was evidenced by a combination of factors, including 1) inability to generate productive LTC from RelB(-/-) mice; 2) presence of DC precursors in RelB(-/-) bone marrow and spleen, which could produce DC in stromal cocultures; and 3) increased myeloid precursor frequency among RelB(-/-) spleen cells over RelB(+/+) control cell population.
development of fully differentiated, but immature myeloid CD11c(+)CD11b(+)MHC-CII(-)CD8alpha(-)CD40(-) DC in spleen LTC is dependent on expression of activated NF-kappaB/Rel-B. However, this appears to relate to stromal cell function rather than to the function of hematopoietic cells. Altogether these data confirm the importance of splenic stromal cells in myelopoiesis leading to development of immature DC as produced in LT.
 plays a major role in regulating the immune system. Therefore, alterations in NF-kappaB activity have profound effects on many immunopathologies, including inflammation, autoimmunity, and lymphoid neoplasia. We investigated the effects of estrogen (17beta-estradiol) on NF-kappaB in C57BL/6 mice since estrogen is a natural immunomodulator and we have recently reported that estrogen up-regulates several NF-kappaB-regulated proteins (inducible NO synthase, IFN-gamma, and MCP-1). We found that in vivo estrogen treatment had differential effects on NF-kappaB family members. Estrogen profoundly blocked the nuclear translocation of p65, c-Rel, and Rel-B, partially blocked p52, but permitted translocation of p50. Despite blockade of both the classical (p65/p50) and alternative (RelB/p52) NF-kappaB activation pathways, estrogen induced constitutive NF-kappaB activity and increased the levels of cytokines regulated by NF-kappaB (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and IFN-gamma). Studies involving a NF-kappaB inhibitor confirmed a positive regulatory role of NF-kappaB on these cytokines. Remarkably, estrogen selectively induced B cell lymphoma 3 (Bcl-3), which is known to associate with p50 to confer transactivation capabilities, thereby providing a potential link between observed p50 DNA-binding activity and estrogen up-regulation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that Bcl-3 bound to the promoter of the NF-kappaB-regulated inducible NO synthase gene in cells from estrogen-treated mice. Estrogen appeared to act at the posttranscriptional level to up-regulate Bcl-3 because mRNA levels in splenocytes from placebo- and estrogen-treated mice were comparable. The novel findings of differential regulation of NF-kappaB proteins by estrogen provide fresh insight into potential mechanisms by which estrogen can regulate NF-kappaB-dependent immunological event.
fferentiation of myeloid leukemia blasts into antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) for use as cellular vaccines is unique in that identification of tumor-specific antigens may not be necessary because the antigens should already be endogenously expressed. We hypothesized that signaling through protein kinase C (PKC) is required for differentiation of HL-60 promyeloblasts into DCs upon stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187. To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PKC blockade, we pretreated HL-60 myeloid blasts with the protein kinase inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis-1) for 24 hours and then treated the cells with calcium ionophore A23187 for an additional 24 hours. Controls consisted of HL-60 blasts treated with A23187, Bis-1 alone, or media. We noted that blasts cultured in media, Bis-1, or Bis-1 then A23187 did not develop the morphologic and phenotypic DC characteristics, up-regulate Rel B, or activate allogeneic T-cells. Our findings suggested that PKC blockade inhibits morphologic, phenotypic, and functional differentiation of HL-60 promyeloblasts into antigen-presenting DCs. Our findings supported the role of PKC as an obligatory pathway for calcium ionophore A23187-induced differentiation of HL-60 myeloblasts into antigen-presenting DC.
F-kappaB family of transcription factors is implicated in cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration and cell interactions. Here, we examined by immunohistochemistry the expression pattern of various members of this family during postnatal telencephalon development and during adulthood, and we used neuronal and glial markers to identify the cells types where they are expressed. Distinct Rel/NF-kappaB proteins are highly expressed postnatally in the subventricular zone and in the rostral migratory stream. In particular, Rel A and p50 are expressed in radial glial cells, in migrating neuron precursors and in a population belonging to the astrocytic lineage. Rel B, on the other hand, is only expressed in migrating neuron precursors, whereas c-Rel is present in a few cells located at the edges of the rostral migratory stream. The expression of Rel A and p50 persists into adulthood, particularly in subventricular zone astrocyte-like cells and in migrating neuron precursors, respectively. The selective expression of NF-kappaB members in the postnatal subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream and their persistence into adulthood in regions of ongoing neurogenesis suggests possible mechanisms linking NF-kappaB expression with cell proliferation and migration. Their presence in actively proliferating progenitor cells, detected by BrdU staining, further suggests that NF-kappaB may be part of a signaling pathway that is important for neurogenesi.
s, the Igh gene locus contains several DNase I-hypersensitive (hs) sites with enhancer activity. These include the 3' Igh enhancers, which are located downstream of the Calpha gene(s) in both mouse and human. In vivo experiments have implicated murine 3' enhancers, hs3B and/or hs4, in class switching and somatic hypermutation. We previously reported that murine hs4 was regulated by NF-kappaB, octamer binding proteins, and Pax5 (B cell-specific activator protein). In this study we report that human hs4 is regulated differently. EMSAs and Western analysis of normal B cells before and after stimulation with anti-IgM plus anti-CD40 showed the same complex binding pattern formed by NF-kappaB, Oct-1, and Oct-2 (but not by Pax5). A similar EMSA pattern was detected in mature human B cell lines (BL-2, Ramos, and HS-Sultan) and in diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines, although yin yang 1 protein (YY1) binding was also observed. We have confirmed the in vivo association of these transcription factors with hs4 in B cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines had a distinctive slow-migrating complex containing YY1 associated with Rel-B. We have confirmed by endogenous coimmunoprecipitation an association of YY1 with Rel-B, but not with other NF-kappaB family members. Transient transfection assays showed robust hs4 enhancer activity in the mature B cell lines, which was dependent on synergistic interactions between NF-kappaB and octamer binding proteins. In addition, human hs4 enhancer activity required Oct-2 and correlated with expression of Oct coactivator from B cells (OCA-B.
rium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is given to millions of neonates in developing countries as a vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis; however, little is known about the initiation of response in neonatal dendritic cells (DCs) to BCG. To address this issue, the interaction of BCG with human cord blood monocyte-derived DCs was studied. We showed that BCG could promote cord blood monocyte-derived DC maturation by up-regulation of CD80, CD83, CD86, CD40, and MHC class II molecules and down-regulation of mannose receptor. BCG was able to induce similar levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-10 but no bioactive IL-12p70 production from cord blood DCs as from adult blood DCs. Functionally BCG-treated cord blood DCs had higher ability to induce mixed lymphocyte reaction than non-BCG-treated cord blood DCs. Both non-BCG-treated and BCG-treated cord blood DCs efficiently induced a high level of IL-10, medium level of interferon-gamma, but little IL-4 production by cord blood naïve CD4+ T cells. Heat shock protein 65, a key component of BCG, had no effect on cord blood DC maturation in terms of CD86, MHC class II, and mannose receptor up-regulation. During the BCG-induced maturation process of cord blood DCs, nuclear transcription factor Rel-B was up-regulated and cytosolic Rel-B down-regulated with cytosolic IkappaB alpha and beta degradation. These results suggest that BCG can promote cord blood monocyte-derived DC maturation, and that the mechanism is through the up-regulation of nuclear Rel-B secondary to the degradation of cytosolic IkappaB alpha and bet.
kine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is secreted by human glomerular mesangial cells in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) and has a central role in amplifying the inflammatory response during glomerulonephritis. However, the mechanism by which IL-1 regulates its transcription is not understood. Specific members of the nuclear factor kappaB/rel (NF-kappaB) proteins may regulate MCP-1 expression in a stimulus- and tissue-specific manne.
oretic mobility shift assays and Western blot analysis characterized the members of the NF-kappaB family that bound the two NF-kappaB sites of the MCP-1 enhancer (A1 and A2) in vitro. Trans-activation of the MCP-1 gene was investigated by transfer of the MCP-1 enhancer DNA to mesangial cell.
uman mesangial cells contained in addition to p50 (NF-kappaB1) and p65 (Rel A) NF-kappaB proteins, the oncoprotein c-rel, and Rel B, but not p52 (NF-kappaB2). IL-1 induced c-rel to form a complex with p65, which bound the MCP-1 A2 site but not the A1 or IL-6 NF-kappaB sites in vitro. IL-1 up-regulated transfected MCP-1 enhancer activity. Cotransfer of the MCP-1 enhancer together with individual members of the NF-kappaB family showed that the heterodimer c-relp65 or (p65)2 can selectively trans-activate the MCP-1 gene via its A1 and A2 sites in mesangial cell.
y demonstrates for the first time that the c-rel oncoprotein can enhance MCP-1 transcription in mesangial cells and suggests that it may have an important role in amplifying gene expression in the inflamed glomerulu.
ecent advances in genome engineering made possible by the emergence of site-specific endonucleases, there remains a need for tools capable of specifically delivering genetic payloads into the human genome. Hybrid recombinases based on activated catalytic domains derived from the resolvase/invertase family of serine recombinases fused to Cys2-His2 zinc-finger or TAL effector DNA-binding domains are a class of reagents capable of achieving this. The utility of these enzymes, however, has been constrained by their low overall targeting specificity, largely due to the formation of side-product homodimers capable of inducing off-target modifications. Here, we combine rational design and directed evolution to re-engineer the serine recombinase dimerization interface and generate a recombinase architecture that reduces formation of these undesirable homodimers by &gt;500-fold. We show that these enhanced recombinases demonstrate substantially improved targeting specificity in mammalian cells and achieve rates of site-specific integration similar to those previously reported for site-specific nucleases. Additionally, we show that enhanced recombinases exhibit low toxicity and promote the delivery of the human coagulation factor IX and α-galactosidase genes into endogenous genomic loci with high specificity. These results provide a general means for improving hybrid recombinase specificity by protein engineering and illustrate the potential of these enzymes for basic research and therapeutic application.
ritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease showing altered bone metabolism. Osteoblasts contribute to the regulation of cartilage metabolism and bone remodeling. We have shown previously that induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects OA cartilage against inflammatory and degradative responses. In this study, we investigated the effects of HO-1 induction on OA osteoblast metabolism. HO-1 was induced with cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP) and by transduction with LV-HO-1. In osteoblasts stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1β, CoPP enhanced mineralization, the expression of a number of markers of osteoblast differentiation such as Runx2, bone morphogenetic protein-2, osteocalcin, and collagen 1A1 and 1A2, as well as the ratio osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. HO-1 induction significantly reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2 and MMP-3, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 whereas IL-10 levels increased. HO-1 also exerted inhibitory effects on prostaglandin (PG)E(2) production which could be dependent on cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal PGE synthase-1 down-regulation. The activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and the expression of the senescence marker caveolin-1 were significantly decreased after HO-1 induction. The inhibition of nuclear factor-κB activation induced by IL-1β in OA osteoblasts may contribute to some HO-1 effects. Our results have shown that HO-1 decreases the production of relevant inflammatory and catabolic mediators that participate in OA pathophysiology thus eliciting protective effects in OA osteoblast.
gene transfer might permit modulation of concurrent biochemical pathways involved in acute lung graft rejection. We investigated whether gene cotransfection into the recipient reduces acute lung graft rejectio.
way rats were used as donors, and F344 rats were used as recipients. Recipient animals were injected with saline (groups I/VI) or 1 x 10(10) pfu of adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase (groups II/VII), transforming growth factor beta1 (groups III/VIII), interleukin 10 (groups IV/IX), or both transforming growth factor beta1 and interleukin 10 (groups V/X) into both leg muscles 2 days before transplantation (groups I-V) or at the time of harvest (groups VI-X). The Kruskal-Wallis test for rejection score and 1-way analysis of variance were used to compare group.
on was significantly improved in the cotransfected groups treated 2 days before transplantation and at the time of harvest. Rejection scores were also reduced in the cotransfected groups. In group V cotransfection suppressed endogenous interleukin 2 but not interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alph.
 intramuscular cotransfection of transforming growth factor beta1 and interleukin 10 suppressed interleukin 2 expression and provided a synergistic effect that reduced acute lung graft rejection. This approach might be applied to the clinical setting because transplant recipients could be treated at the time of implantatio.
ed, CMV-based plasmid DNA constructs encoding human alpha-galactosidase A and factor IX were injected into C57Bl/6, BALB/c, and CD1 mice using hydrodynamics-based delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA), and gene expression was monitored for 6 months. Linearized and supercoiled pDNAs were compared for their abilities to support long-term expression and to generate immune responses to the transgene product. In all mouse strains supercoiled CpG-reduced pDNA encoding alpha-galactosidase A and factor IX generated higher and more sustained levels of circulating gene product than their supercoiled CpG-replete analogs. Linearizing supercoiled CpG-reduced pDNA did not significantly increase levels of circulating gene product beyond levels supercoiled CpG-reduced pDNA could achieve. Linearizing supercoiled CpG-replete pDNA vectors significantly increased expression compared to their supercoiled CpG-replete analogs, but the increase was short-lived or subtherapeutic. Regardless of vector, liver depot expression did not elicit significant antibody responses to human alpha-galactosidase A or factor IX. Taken together, these data suggest that a clinically acceptable hydrodynamics-based approach targeting the liver combined with CpG-reduced pDNA vectors may represent a viable option for individuals with hemophilia, a lysosomal storage disease, or other disease in which prolonged depot expression of a therapeutic protein from the liver is desirabl.
Fabry Disease (AFD) is an extremely painful and debilitating multi-system X-linked disorder due to alpha-galactosidase enzyme deficiency. To date, no baseline data on health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) have been reported in males affected with this condition. In this study, 38 males with AFD completed Medical Outcomes Study Short Form, EuroQoL questionnaires and an AFD-specific questionnaire prior to the start of a trial involving replacement therapy with alpha-galactosidase. Results from these questionnaires were compared to the results from a similar HR-QoL study in males with severe haemophilia (factor VIII/IX deficiency) that used the same questionnaires and to the results of two large normative studies. The results on both questionnaires showed that in most instances males with AFD recorded significantly lower HR-QoL compared with males in the general population and individuals with severe haemophilia after adjusting for differences in age. These findings suggest therefore, that the scope for improvement in HR-QoL as a result of treatment with an appropriate agent is extremely larg.
muscle is a privileged target for long-term rAAV-mediated gene transfer in mouse, rat, dog and non-human primates. Intramuscular injections of rAAV encoding human factor IX in hemophilia B patients have been initiated, based on promising results gathered in affected dogs. We found that intramuscular rAAV administration in rats resulted in restricted transduction essentially along the myofibers axis with poor lateral diffusion. This suggested that the transduction rate might be limited by the ability of the virus to reach sites distant from the injection point. We tested whether hyaluronidase, an enzyme which dissociates the extracellular matrix, could enhance vector diffusion when injected in the rat muscle before administration of rAAV encoding either nuclear-localized beta-galactosidase (rAAVCMVnlsLacZ) or the human alpha-1-antitrypsin (rAAVCMVhAAT) under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate--early promoter (CMV). The results showed that pretreatment of the rat anterior tibialis muscle with hyaluronidase resulted in: (1) a larger diffusion of the virus indicated by an increase in the area containing LacZ-transduced fibers, and (2) a two- to three-fold increase of transduction efficiency measured by the number of LacZ-positive fibers or by the hAAT serum concentration. We also provide evidence that hyaluronidase was well tolerated and was not associated with short- or long-term toxicity evaluated by morphological studies. Finally, in our experimental conditions, hyaluronidase did not promote rAAV dissemination to other organs as assessed by PCR to detect vector sequences. We conclude that pretreatment of skeletal muscle by hyaluronidase, a clinically available reagent, was harmless and resulted in a consistent and significant increase in rAAV diffusion and transduction level.
n enzyme complex receptor (SECR) expressed on hepatocytes binds to a conserved sequence in alpha 1-antitrypain (alpha 1-AT) and other serpins. A molecular conjugate consisting of a synthetic peptide (C1315) based on the SECR binding motif of human alpha 1-AT covalently coupled to poly-L-lysine was used to introduce reporter genes into hepatoma cell lines in culture. This conjugate condensed DNA into spheroidal particles 18-25 nm in diameter. When transfected with the SECR-directed complex containing pGL3, Hep G2 cells that express the receptor, but not Hep G2 cells that do not, expressed a peak luciferase activity of 538,731 +/- 144,346 integrated light units/mg protein 4 days after transfection. Free peptide inhibited uptake and expression in a dose-dependent manner. Complexes of DNA condensed with polylysine or LC-sulfo-N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate-substituted polylysine were ineffective. Transfection with a plasmid encoding human factor IX produced expression in Hep G2 (high) and HuH7 cells that express SECR but not Hep G2 (low) cells that lack the receptor. Fluorescein-labeled C1315 peptide labeled 9-31% of Hep G2 (high), 10-14% of HuH7, and 0.6-3.4% of Hep G2 (low) cells, and when the lac Z gene was transfected, only these cells expressed beta-galactosidase. SECR-mediated gene transfer gives efficient, specific uptake and high-level expression of three reporter genes, and the system merits further study for gene therap.
t findings that prolonged expression of certain adenovirus (Ad) vector-encoded proteins, including human alpha1-antitrypsin (huAAT), mouse erythropoietin (EPO), and human factor IX, can be achieved in animals that do not mount an immune response to the reporter protein were obtained with mouse strains which have been shown to be capable of mounting a cellular immune response against Ad vector antigens. This suggests either that Ad vectors expressing nonimmunogenic transgenes fail to elicit a cellular immune response or that an Ad-specific cellular immune response does develop but is ineffective against cells expressing nonimmunogenic transgenes. Here we demonstrate that an Ad vector expressing huAAT administered by intravenous injection does stimulate an Ad-specific cellular immune response but that this response fails to abolish vector-directed gene expression in vivo. Moreover, expression of huAAT remained stable in animals stimulated by concurrent and multiple administrations of different Ad vectors or viruses. We also demonstrate prolonged expression of huAAT in CD1 mice transgenic for the huAAT gene, indicating that long-term expression is not restricted to C57BL/6 mice. These results demonstrate that under some circumstances, an Ad vector can direct prolonged expression of a nonimmunogenic transgene despite the presence of a robust Ad-specific cellular immune respons.
-linked immunoassay has been developed to quantitate the activated human factor IX-antithrombin III complex (IXa-AT III). Test plasma was absorbed onto barium citrate and eluted to remove free antithrombin III (AT III). The IXa-AT III complex in the eluate was then measured by using polystyrene balls coated with immobilized rabbit anti-AT III antibody-binding fragments and anti-factor IX (anti-FIX) antibody-binding fragments labeled with beta-D-galactosidase. The assay was very sensitive, detecting a concentration as low as 0.15 fmol/assay/100 microliters plasma, which corresponds to as little as 0.002% of activated FIX in plasma. Experiments with purified FIX, IXa-alpha, AT III, IXa-AT III, normal plasma, AT III-depleted plasma, and FIX-deficient plasma demonstrated that the assay is specific. IXa-AT III generation could be detected in normal native whole blood within 2.0 minutes after venipuncture. The complex could not be detected in native whole blood from patients with severe hemophilia B even at 1 hour after venipuncture. The mean plasma level of IXa-AT III in healthy adults (n = 32, ages 23 to 54 years) was 9.67 +/- 2.86 pmol/L (mean +/- SD), whereas in eight patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation levels ranged from 11.7 to 35.0 pmol/L. The IXa-AT III titer was significantly reduced in three patients with severe factor VII deficiency (5.70 +/- 1.99 pmol/L) but was normal in three patients with severe factor XI deficiency (11.2 +/- 1.59 pmol/L). Purified IXa-AT III was cleared in vivo in rabbits with a half-life value of 30 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORD.
he higher-order structure of chromatin is achieved by constraining DNA in loops ranging in size from 30 to 100 kilobase pairs; these loops have been implicated in defining functional domains and replicons and possibly in facilitating transcription. Because the human active and inactive X chromosomes differ in transcriptional activity and replication, we looked for differences in their chromatin loop structures. Since the islands of CpG-rich DNA at the 5' ends of X-linked housekeeping genes are the regions where functional differences in DNA methylation and nuclease sensitivity are found, we looked for scaffold association of these sequences after extraction of histones with lithium diiodosalicylate. Specifically, we examined the 5' CpG islands within the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, P3, GdX, phosphoglycerate kinase type 1, and alpha-galactosidase loci in human lymphoblasts obtained from individuals with 1 to 4 X chromosomes. Although we detected no scaffold-associated regions near these genes, we found several such regions at the ornithine transcarbamylase and blood clotting factor IX loci. Our results suggest that the CpG islands are excluded from the nuclear scaffold and that even though transcriptionally active, housekeeping genes are less likely than X-linked tissue-specific genes to be scaffold associated. In all cases, the pattern of scaffold association was the same for loci on active and inactive X chromosome.
e the extent to which the X chromosome has been conserved during mammalian evolution, we compared six loci that are X-linked in the human genome with the corresponding genes of the North American marsupial, the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Our analysis shows that in the opossum genome there are sequences highly homologous to those of human cDNAs for housekeeping genes, glucose-6-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), phosphoglycerate kinase A (PGK1), and alpha-galactosidase A (GLA). However, ornithine transcarbamylase and blood clotting Factor IX--tissue-specific genes that are X-linked in eutherians mammals--have no highly conserved homologs in the marsupial genome. By cloning opossum G6PD and HPRT, we found that these genes are X-linked in the opossum and that homologous sequences are limited to coding regions. As all genomic fragments hybridizing with the human GLA probe show dosage effects, it is likely that the opossum counterpart is X-linked. Finally, the pattern of hybridization suggests that the autosomal pseudogenes of HPRT and PGK1 in the opossum have remained highly homologous to the human X-linked gene.
y uses high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) to quantify divalent metal ion (X(2+))-induced compaction found in vitamin K-dependent (VKD) proteins. Multiple X(2+) binding sites formed by the presence of up to 12 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues are present in plasma-derived FIX (pd-FIX) and recombinant FIX (r-FIX). Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was used to calibrate the Stokes radius (R) measured by HPSEC. A compaction of pd-FIX caused by the filling of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) binding sites resulted in a 5 to 6% decrease in radius of hydration as observed by HPSEC. The filling of Ca(2+) sites resulted in greater compaction than for Mg(2+) alone where this effect was additive or greater when both ions were present at physiological levels. Less X(2+)-induced compaction was observed in r-FIX with lower Gla content populations, which enabled the separation of biologically active r-FIX species from inactive ones by HPSEC. HPSEC was sensitive to R changes of approximately 0.01nm that enabled the detection of FIX compaction that was likely cooperative in nature between lower avidity X(2+) sites of the Gla domain and higher avidity X(2+) sites of the epidermal growth factor 1 (EGF1)-like domai.
on factor X (FX) zymogen activation by factor IXa (FIXa) enzyme plays a critical role in the middle-phase of coagulation cascade. The activation process is catalytically inert and requires FIXa binding and complex formation with co-factor VIIIa (FVIIIa). In order to understand the structural details of the FVIIIa:FIXa complex, we employed knowledge-driven protein-protein docking and aqueous-phase MD refinement methods to develop a stable structural complex between FVIIIa and FIXa. The model shows that all four domains of FIXa wrap across FVIIIa that spans the co-factor binding surface of A2, A3 and C1 domains. The region surrounding the 558-helix of the A2-domain of FVIIIa is predicted to be the key interaction site with the helical segments of Lys293-Lys301 and Asp332-Arg338 residues of the serine-protease domain of FIXa. The hydrophobic helical stack between the GLA and EGF1 domains of FIXa is predicted to be primary interacting region with the A3-C2 domain interface of FVIII.
n of biopharmaceuticals from transgenic animal milk is a cost-effective method for highly complex proteins that cannot be efficiently produced using conventional systems such as microorganisms or animal cells. Yields of recombinant human factor IX (rhFIX) produced from transgenic porcine milk under the control of the bovine α-lactalbumin promoter reached 0.25 mg/mL. The rhFIX protein was purified from transgenic porcine milk using a three-column purification scheme after a precipitation step to remove casein. The purified protein had high specific activity and a low ratio of the active form (FIXa). The purified rhFIX had 11.9 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues/mol protein, which approached full occupancy of the 12 potential sites in the Gla domain. The rhFIX was shown to have a higher isoelectric point and lower sialic acid content than plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX). The rhFIX had the same N-glycosylation sites and phosphorylation sites as pdFIX, but had a higher specific activity. These results suggest that rhFIX produced from porcine milk is physiologically active and they support the use of transgenic animals as bioreactors for industrial scale production in mil.
 (fXI) is the zymogen of a plasma protease, factor XIa (fXIa), that contributes to thrombin generation during blood coagulation by proteolytic conversion of factor IX (fIX) to factor IXaβ (fIXaβ). There is considerable interest in fXIa as a therapeutic target because it contributes to thrombosis, while serving a relatively minor role in hemostasis. FXI/XIa has a distinctly different structure than other plasma coagulation proteases. Specifically, the protein lacks a phospholipid-binding Gla-domain, and is a homodimer. Each subunit of a fXIa dimer contains four apple domains (A1 to A4) and one trypsin-like catalytic domain. The A3 domain contains a binding site (exosite) that largely determines affinity and specificity for the substrate fIX. After binding to fXIa, fIX undergoes a single cleavage to form the intermediate fIXα. FIXα then rebinds to the A3 domain to undergo a second cleavage, generating fIXaβ. The catalytic efficiency for the second cleavage is ~7-fold greater than that of the first cleavage, limiting fIXα accumulation. Residues at the N-terminus and C-terminus of the fXIa A3 domain likely form the fIX binding site. The dimeric conformation of fXIa is not required for normal fIX activation in solution. However, monomeric forms of fXI do not reconstitute fXI-deficient mice in arterial thrombosis models, indicating the dimer is required for normal function in vivo. FXI must be a dimer to be activated normal by the protease fXIIa. It is also possible that the dimeric structure is an adaptation that allows fXI/XIa to bind to a surface through one subunit, while binding to its substrate fIX through the othe.
 factor VII is approved for treating hemophilia patients with autoantibodies to their factor IX or FVIII; however, its mechanism of action remains controversial. Some studies suggest that FVIIa requires tissue factor (TF) for function and that the reason for the high dose requirement is that it must compete with endogenous FVII for tissue factor. Others suggest that FVIIa binds platelets where it activates FX directly; the high concentration required would result from FVIIa's weak affinity for phospholipids. We address this question by infusing a chimera of mouse FIX (Gla and EGF1) with FVIIa (EGF2 and catalytic domain) into hemophilia B mice. This mutant has no TF-dependent activity because it cannot functionally bind TF at physiologically relevant concentrations. In vivo, this mutant is as effective as mouse FVIIa in controlling bleeding in hemophilia B mice. Our results suggest that the hemostatic effect of pharmacologic doses of FVIIa is TF independen.
and other 4-hydroxycoumarins inhibit vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) by depleting reduced vitamin K that is required for posttranslational modification of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. In vitro prediction of the in vivo potency of vitamin K antagonists is complicated by the complex multicomponent nature of the vitamin K cycle. Here we describe a sensitive assay that enables quantitative analysis of γ-glutamyl carboxylation and its antagonism in live cells. We engineered a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293-derived cell line (HEK 293-C3) to express a chimeric protein (F9CH) comprising the Gla domain of factor IX fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of proline-rich Gla protein 2. Maximal γ-glutamyl carboxylation of F9CH required vitamin K supplementation, and was dose-dependently inhibited by racemic warfarin at a physiologically relevant concentration. Cellular γ-glutamyl carboxylation also exhibited differential VKOR inhibition by warfarin enantiomers (S &gt; R) consistent with their in vivo potencies. We further analyzed the structure-activity relationship for inhibition of γ-glutamyl carboxylation by warfarin metabolites, observing tolerance to phenolic substitution at the C-5 and especially C-6, but not C-7 or C-8, positions on the 4-hydroxycoumarin nucleus. After correction for in vivo concentration and protein binding, 10-hydroxywarfarin and warfarin alcohols were predicted to be the most potent inhibitory metabolites in viv.
a B (HB) is a recessive X-linked inherited disorder, the pathogenesis of HB is deficiency or functional abnormalities of coagulation factor IX, which is caused by F9 gene mutations. To explore the mechanism of its molecular pathology, 40 patients with HB were studied with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The diagnosis of HB patients were based on clinical manifestation and deficient factor IX activity in plasma. DNA was routinely extracted from peripheral blood cells of the patients and their relatives, all the 8 exons and their flanking boundaries were amplified by PCR, and the PCR products were screened by direct sequencing. Mutations which were found in study need to exclude polymorphism. The results showed that 34 mutations were confirmed in 40 HB patients, including 6 nonsense mutations, 24 missense mutations, 2 splice site mutations and 2 frame mutations for 1 or 2 nucleotide insertion. After retrieved, 4 missense mutations and 1 frameshift mutation were found for the first time. Among the 34 mutations, 2 mutations in signal peptide, 7 mutations in propeptide and gla domain, 7 mutations in epidermal growth factor-like domain, 3 mutations in activation domain, 15 mutations in serine protease or catalytic domain. It is concluded that gene analysis can directly explain molecular mechanism of hemophilia B and also provides the foundation for further studies to the function of coagulation factor IX. There is obvious heterogeneity in F9 gene mutation and missense mutation is still the main way of mutation, which are closely related to clinical features. DNA sequencing and linkage analysis are efficient methods for HB carriers and prenatal gene diagnosi.
itamin K-dependent proteins (e.g., Factors II, VII, IX and X) form part of the clotting cascade. Factor II (FII)/Prothrombin incorporates 10 Glu residues on the N-terminal region that are γ-carboxylated to Gla residues by the action of γ-glutamyl carboxylase to confer biological activity. Vitamin K is also required for the normal function of Matrix Gla Protein (MGP)--one of several non-clotting-related extra-hepatic vitamin K-dependent proteins. MGP is known to have protective action against vascular calcification--indeed it is a powerful tissue-bound inhibitory mechanism and can be found in blood vessel walls. The mature protein is also dependent on activation by γ-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme to convert Glu residues in its amino acid sequence to Gla. This reaction can only take place when the enzyme is activated in the presence of vitamin K. It is of great potential interest to investigate whether subtle deficiencies of vitamin K may, through its effect on the action of MGP, be a contributing factor to vascular calcification in CKD patients, in whom CV disease is greatly accelerated and in whom vascular calcification is not only common, but progresses aggressively, and is something for which as yet there is no clinically applicable remed.
a (FIXa) is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation serine protease which binds to factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) on negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (PCPS) to catalyse the activation of factor X (FX) to factor Xa (FXa) in the intrinsic pathway. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies have indicated that the Gla-domain-dependent interaction of FIXa and FX with PCPS in the presence of FVIIIa positions the active-site of the protease at an appropriate height above the membrane surface to optimise the catalytic reaction. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the NH2-terminal EGF-domain (EGF1) of FIXa to the recognition specificity of intrinsic tenase by constructing an EGF1 deletion mutant of FIXa (FIXa-desEGF1) and characterising the properties of the mutant in kinetic, direct binding and FRET assays. The results of direct binding and kinetic studies demonstrated that the binding affinity of the mutant for interaction with FVIIIa on PCPS has been impaired greater than 10-fold and the catalytic efficiency of the mutant protease-FVIIIa-PCPS complex in the activation of FX has been decreased ~100-fold. By contrast, the mutant protease exhibited a normal activity toward FX in the absence of the protein cofactor. FRET measurements revealed that the distance of the active-site of the mutant FIXa relative to PCPS vesicles has been decreased 10 Å from 75 ± 2 Å for FIXa to 65 ± 2 Å for FIXa-desEGF1 independent of FVIIIa. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal EGF-domain of FIXa provides a binding-site for FVIIIa and plays an essential spacer function in the intrinsic tenase comple.
I (FVII) consists of an N-terminal gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain followed by two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF1 and EGF2) domains and the C-terminal protease domain. Activation of FVII results in a two-chain FVIIa molecule consisting of a light chain (Gla-EGF1-EGF2 domains) and a heavy chain (protease domain) held together by a single disulfide bond. During coagulation, the complex of tissue factor (TF, a transmembrane glycoprotein) and FVIIa activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX). FVIIa is structurally &quot;zymogen-like&quot; and when bound to TF, it is more &quot;active enzyme-like.&quot; FIX and FX share structural homology with FVII. Three structural biology aspects of FVIIa/TF are presented in this review. One, regions in soluble TF (sTF) that interact with FVIIa as well as mapping of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and Zn2+ sites in FVIIa and their functions; two, modeled interactive regions of Gla and EGF1 domains of FXa and FIXa with FVIIa/sTF; and three, incompletely formed oxyanion hole in FVIIa/sTF and its induction by substrate/inhibitor. Finally, an overview of the recognition elements in TF pathway inhibitor is provide.
a is caused by deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII or IX, resulting in direct blockade of the intrinsic tenase complex and indirect blockade of the extrinsic tenase complex which is rapidly inhibited upon binding of factor Xa to tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We evaluated the ability of Gla-domainless factor Xa, a truncated form of factor Xa devoid of procoagulant properties, to bind to tissue factor pathway inhibitor and to alleviate the physiological inhibition of the extrinsic tenas.
hrombin generation assay triggered by a low concentration of tissue factor, we evaluated the ability of Gla-domainless factor Xa to restore blood coagulation in plasma from hemophilia A and B patients without and with inhibitors. We then compared its efficacy to generate thrombin to depletion of antithrombin or tissue factor pathway inhibitor by specific antibodies. Finally, we compared the kinetics of neutralization of factor Xa and Gla-domainless factor Xa by antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibito.
nless factor Xa was able to restore thrombin generation in plasma samples from hemophiliacs. This effect was observed for plasma from hemophilia A patients without or with inhibitors and for plasma from hemophilia B patients. Gla-domainless factor Xa had a lower affinity than factor Xa for tissue factor pathway inhibitor whereas the affinities of both proteins for antithrombin were similar. Finally, despite a short half-life in plasma, the effect of Gla-domainless factor Xa on thrombin generation was sustained for at least 1 hou.
mainless factor Xa was able to restore thrombin generation in plasma from hemophilia patients, our results suggest that it may be an effective alternative to current treatments for hemophilia with or without an inhibito.
lation factor I (ACF I), a snake C-type lectin (snaclec) from the venom of Agkistrodon acutus binds specifically with activated factor X (FXa) in a Ca2+-dependent manner and prolongs the blood-clotting time in vitro. In this study, the inhibition of the coagulation pathway by ACF I was measured in vivo by activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time assays and the binding of ACF I to factor IX (FIX) was investigated by native PAGE and surface plasmon resonance. The results indicate that ACF I inhibits both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, but does not inhibit thrombin activity. ACF I also binds FIX in a Ca2+-dependent manner and their maximal binding occurs at 0.25 mM Ca2+. ACF I has a higher binding-affinity to FIX than to FX. Ca2+ is required to maintain in vivo function of FIX Gla domain for its recognition of ACF I. However, Ca2+ at high concentrations (&gt;0.25 mM) inhibits the binding of ACF I to FIX. Ca2+ functions as a switch for the binding between ACF I and FIX. The results suggest that the binding of ACF I with FIX may play a dominant role in the anticoagulation activity of ACF I in viv.
tting is triggered when the plasma serine protease factor VIIa binds to the cell-surface protein, tissue factor (TF); the resulting TF:FVIIa complex activates factors IX (FIX) and X (FX) by limited proteolysis. FVIIa, FIX and FX all bind reversibly to membranes via their gamma-carboxyglutamate-rich (GLA) domains, while TF is an integral membrane protein. Removing these proteases from the membrane surface is known to render them thousands of times less active, although the mechanisms by which blood clotting proteins bind to membranes-and the contributions of membranes to catalysis-remain very incompletely understood. Our recent and ongoing studies use a combination of nanoscale membrane bilayers (Nanodiscs), solid-state NMR and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enabling detailed insights into how GLA domains bind to phospholipid bilayers and how specific phospholipids enhance the catalytic activity of the TF:FVIIa comple.
)VIII functions as a cofactor in the tenase complex responsible for phospholipid (PL)-dependent FXa generation by FIXa. We have recently reported that the FVIIIa C2 domain (residues 2228-2240) interacts with the FIXa Gla domain in this complex. We examined the role of this interaction in the generation of tenase activity during the process of clot formation, using a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 2228-2240. The peptide 2228-2240 inhibited FVIIIa/FIXa-mediated FX activation dose-dependently in the presence of PL by &gt;95% (IC50; ~10 μM). This effect was significantly greater than that obtained by peptide 1804-1818 (IC50; ~180 μM) which corresponds to another FIXa-interactive site in the light chain that provides the majority of binding energy for FIXa interaction. Peptide 2228-2240 had little effect on the prothrombin time and did not inhibit FIX activation in the coagulation process mediated by FVIIa/tissue factor or FXIa, suggesting specific inhibition of the intrinsic tenase complex. Clot waveform analysis, a plasma based-assay used to evaluate the process of intrinsic coagulation, demonstrated that peptide 2228-2240 significantly depressed both maximum coagulation velocity (|min1|) and acceleration (|min2|), reflecting the propagation of clot formation, although the clotting time was only marginally prolonged. Thromboelastography, an alternative whole blood based-assay, demonstrated that the peptide inhibited clot formation time, α-angle and maximal clot firmness, but had little effect on the clotting time. Interactions of the FVIIIa C2 domain (residues 2228-2240) with the FIXa Gla domain in the tenase complex appeared to contribute essentially to the propagation of clot formatio.
disorders secondary to acquired non-inhibitory antibodies directed against vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins are rare. In this report, the authors describe a patient with a low grade lymphoma who presented with a fatal acquired bleeding manifestation and abnormal hemostatic studies resulting from deficiencies in both prothrombin and factor X. Patient plasma samples were collected and studied for the presence of an acquired inhibitor. Levels of plasma coagulation proteins were measured using immunoassay. Patient anti-prothrombin immunoglobulin G was isolated and binding to prothrombin, prothrombin F1.2, factors IX and X was evaluated using immunoblots and competition immunoassay. Prolongation in the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time suggested a factor deficiency in the common pathway of coagulation. Functional and antigenic levels of both prothrombin and factor X were decreased. An IgG subtype-4 antibody was isolated from patient plasma using affinity chromatography on prothrombin-sepharose. This antibody was found to bind to a common metal-ion-dependent conformational epitope found on the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of prothrombin, factor X and factor IX. This report represents the first description of an acquired bleeding disorder resulting from a unique cross-reactive auto-antibody against a common metal-ion-dependent antigenic structure on the Gla-domain of the vitamin K-dependent protein.
be a cell-based assay for studying vitamin K-cycle enzymes. A reporter protein consisting of the gla domain of factor IX (amino acids 1-46) and residues 47-420 of protein C was stably expressed in HEK293 and AV12 cells. Both cell lines secrete carboxylated reporter when fed vitamin K or vitamin K epoxide (KO). However, neither cell line carboxylated the reporter when fed KO in the presence of warfarin. In the presence of warfarin, vitamin K rescued carboxylation in HEK293 cells but not in AV12 cells. Dicoumarol, an NAD(P)H-dependent quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) inhibitor, behaved similarly to warfarin in both cell lines. Warfarin-resistant vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR-Y139F) supported carboxylation in HEK293 cells when fed KO in the presence of warfarin, but it did not in AV12 cells. These results suggest the following: (1) our cell system is a good model for studying the vitamin K cycle, (2) the warfarin-resistant enzyme reducing vitamin K to hydroquinone (KH₂) is probably not NQO1, (3) there appears to be a warfarin-sensitive enzyme other than VKOR that reduces vitamin K to KH₂, and (4) the primary function of VKOR is the reduction of KO to vitamin .

-binding protein (AHP IX-bp), a Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding protein from the venom of Agkistrodon Halys Pallas was reported to bind specifically with factor IX in a Zn2+-dependent manner. Here we have purified AHP IX-bp by a simple two-step of chromatography procedure and found that AHP IX-bp also binds factor Xa (FXa) with high binding-affinity in a Mg2+-dependent manner. Although Mg2+ ions have a significantly low binding-affinity for apo-AHP IX-bp as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, they can induce the binding of apo-AHP IX-bp with FXa even in the absence of Ca2+ as determined by native PAGE and surface plasmon resonance. Mg2+ ions are required to maintain in vivo function of FX Gla domain for its recognition of AHP IX-bp. Both Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions fail to induce the binding between apo-AHP IX-bp and FXa. The abundant Mg2+ ions in blood play an important role in the anticoagulation of AHP IX-b.
 proteins, even without sequence similarity, still can contain similar surface regions involved in protein-protein interactions with common target. These regions can serve as structural determinants of cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, defined as the process in which structural properties of one molecule are simulated by the dissimilar molecules, is implicated in several biologically important processes, including autoimmune and allergic reactions, binding of some ligands to common receptor, and interactions in cell signaling. The problem of identification of the determinants of molecular mimicry is not completely solved at this time. We hypothesize that identification of structurally and chemically similar surface regions of two protein molecules capable of binding to the same target will allow us to identify sites involved in cross-reactivity including determinants of the molecular mimicry. We used a graph-theoretical approach in order to determine highly similar surface regions of two proteins with known three-dimensional structures. This approach uses a variation of Maximal Common Subgraph (MCS) isomorphism, where an association graph is constructed based on the surface-exposed residues of the two molecules and the matching regions are found based on the maximum cliques in the association graph. Testing the proposed method on the targets of autoantibody involved in antiphopholipid syndrome (APS)--beta2-GPI, PC, thrombin, factor IX, factor X, and plasmin allowed identifying potential epitopes for antibody that can inhibit coagulation proteases. Application of this method to the Activated Protein C and factor VII Gla-domains revealed surface regions involved in EPCR and plasma membrane binding, consistent with known experimental results. Analysis of major pollen allergen that can cause food allergies through cross-reactivity found known epitopes involved in cross-reactivity and also revealed additional surface regions that can complement the list of epitopes. Taken together, our results suggest that the proposed graph-theoretical approach can identify determinants of cross-reactivity and molecular mimicr.
patocyte nuclear factor-3alpha (HNF-3alpha) protein is a member of a large family of developmentally regulated transcription factors that share homology in the winged helix/fork head DNA binding domain and participate in embryonic pattern formation. HNF-3alpha also mediates cell-specific transcription of genes important for the function of hepatocytes, intestinal, pancreatic and bronchiolar epithelium. We have previously determined that -520 nucleotides upstream of the rat HNF-3alpha gene were sufficient to elicit hepatoma-specific expression in transfection assays and reported on a novel HNF-3alpha expression pattern in the renal pelvis urothelium of the embryonic and adult kidney. We also showed that retinoic acid mediated activation of the HNF-3alpha gene required -4 kb of the HNF-3alpha promoter region in F9 teratocarcinoma transfections. In order to determine regulatory sequences mediating the HNF-3alpha cellular expression pattern in developing mouse embryos, we created transgenic mice bearing the -4 kb HNF-3alpha promoter region driving expression of the beta-galactosidase transgene. Embryonic analysis of two transgenic mouse lines demonstrated that the -4 kb HNF-3alpha promoter sequences were sufficient to elicit transgene expression in the developing liver, intestine, esophagus, nasal epithelial cells and floorplate of the neurotube, but not in the mesodermal notochord or in the lung bud. One of the transgenic lines also exhibited proper expression in the mesonephric ducts and metanephric diverticulum, suggesting that the -4 kb HNF-3alpha promoter region contained a subset of the regulatory sequences necessary for HNF-3alpha expression in the developing kidne.
 of mouse teratocarcinoma F9 cells with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) causes a 9-fold increase in steady-state levels of mRNA for UDP-Gal:beta-D-Gal alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase (alpha1,3GT) beginning at 36 h. Enzyme activity rises in a similar fashion, which also parallels the induction of laminin and type IV collagen. Nuclear run-on assays indicate that this increase in alpha1,3GT in RA-treated F9 cells, like that of type IV collagen, is transcriptionally regulated. Differentiation also results in increased secretion of soluble alpha1,3GT activity into the growth media. The major alpha-galactosylated glycoprotein present in the media of RA-treated F9 cells, but not of untreated cells, was identified as laminin. Differentiation of F9 cells is accompanied by an increase in alpha-galactosylation of membrane glycoproteins and a decrease in expression of the stage-specific embryonic antigen, SSEA-1 (also known as the Lewis X antigen or LeX), which has the structure Galbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAcbeta1-R. However, flow cytometric analyses with specific antibodies and lectins, following treatment of cells with alpha-galactosidase, demonstrate that differentiated cells contain LeX antigens that are masked by alpha-galactosylation. Thus, RA induces alpha1,3GT at the transcriptional level, resulting in major alterations in the surface phenotype of the cells and masking of LeX antigen.
trans-retinoic acid (RA)-induced endodermal differentiation of mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells is accompanied by changes in glycoprotein glycosylation, including expression of i antigen (i.e. polylactosamine) and leukophytohemagglutinin-reactive oligosaccharides (i.e. -GlcNAc beta 1-6Man alpha 1-6-branched N-linked). We have used the F9 teratocarcinoma cells as a model to study developmental regulation of glycosyltransferase activities which are responsible for the biosynthesis of beta 1-6GlcNAc-branched N- and O-linked oligosaccharides and polylactosamine. Growth of F9 cells in the presence of 10(-6) M RA for 4 days increased core 2 GlcNAc transferase and GlcNAc transferase V activities by 13- and 6-fold, respectively, whereas the activities of GlcNAc transferase I, beta 1-3GlcNAc transferase (i), beta 1-4Gal transferase, and beta 1-3Gal transferase increased 2-4-fold. Induction of glycosyltransferase activities by RA was dose-dependent and showed a biphasic response with approximately half of the increase observed 3 days after RA treatment and the remainder occurred by day 4. PYS-2, a parietal endoderm cell line, showed levels of glycosyltransferase activities similar to those of RA-treated F9 cells. Glycosyltransferase activities in the RA-resistant F9 cell line (RA-3-10) were low and showed only a small induction by RA. These observations suggest that differentiation of F9 cells is closely associated with induction of multiple glycosyltransferase activities, with most pronounced increases in GlcNAc transferase V and 2',5'-tetradenylate (core 2) GlcNAc transferase. The increase in GlcNAc transferase V was also reflected by the 4-6-fold increase in the binding of 125I-leukophytohemagglutinin to several cellular glycoproteins, which occurred after 3 days of RA treatment. The endo-beta-galactosidase-sensitive polylactosamine content of membrane glycoproteins and, in particular, the LAMP-1 glycoprotein was markedly increased after RA treatment of F9 cells. Consistent with these observations, fucosylated polylactosamine (i.e. dimeric Lex) was also increased in RA-treated cells. Analysis of the aryl oligosaccharides produced by F9 cells cultured in the presence of aryl alpha-D-GalNAc showed that RA treatment enhanced the synthesis of disialyl core 2 O-linked oligosaccharides and increased the polylactosamine content of the aryl oligosaccharides by &gt; 20-fold. The results suggest that differentiation of F9 cells into endoderm is closely associated with increased GlcNAc transferase V and core 2 GlcNAc transferase activities, enzymes which control the level of beta 1-6GlcNAc-branched N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, the preferred substrates for polylactosamine additio.
ed a full-length murine cDNA, which had been isolated from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells by using a bovine lactose synthetase A protein cDNA as a probe, in a mammalian expression vector (pCMGT1) and expressed it in COS-1 cells to characterize the pCMGT1-directed enzyme. The galactosyltransferase activity toward asialo-agalacto-transferrin (AsAg-Tf) in the pCMGT1-transfected cells was approximately eightfold higher than that in mock- or non-transfected cells. In contrast, no difference was observed in the specific activity of galactose transfer between pCMGT1-transfected cells and mock- or non-transfected cells when asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin were used as an acceptor. Since almost all [3H]galactose incorporated into the AsAg-Tf was released by digestion with streptococcal beta-galactosidase, most of the linkage created by this enzyme was in the Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc group. The acceptor specificity of the pCMGT1-directed enzyme was changed from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose by adding alpha-lactalbumin in the reaction mixture. Alpha-Lactalbumin also partially inhibited the galactose transfer to AsAg-Tf. The kinetic study revealed that the apparent Km values of the pCMGT1-directed enzyme for N-acetylglucosamine, AsAg-Tf and UDP-Gal are 2 mM, 60 microM and 24 microM, respectively. These results indicated that the murine cDNA isolated from F9 cells encodes an active enzyme which catalyzes not only the lactose synthesis but also the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues of Asn-linked sugar chains of glycoproteins in a beta 1-4 linkag.
can is a high molecular weight glycopeptide, found abundantly in the cell surface of F9, stem cell clone derived from mouse teratocarcinoma. Many differentiation-associated antigens and receptors for lectins have been shown to be carried by embryoglycan. Furthermore, antibodies reacting with embryoglycan have been detected in the sera of patients with ovarian germ cell tumor. We investigated anti-embryoglycan antibodies in the sera of patients with uterine cervical cancer, considering the possibility of the appearance of embryoglycan-like antigen accompanied by malignant changes in the uterine cervix. Reaction between the patients' sera and embryoglycan (or F9 cells) was assayed by Farr's assay and an indirect immunofluorescence method. Among the patients with uterine cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma), 16 of 61 cases (26%) were positive in invasive cases, whereas early cases (14 cases) were all negative. Cases of benign ovarian tumor (23 cases), uterine myoma (25 cases) and 50 normal volunteers were all negative. The antigenic determinant of embryoglycan was found to be alpha-galactosyl residue since alpha-galactosidase-treated embryoglycan lost the activity to bind these antisera. However, the antigenic structure of alpha-galactosyl residue was shown to be distinct from the antigenic determinant of erythrocytes blood type B, but to some degree cross reacted with it, in an absorption test. These results indicate that an unusual alpha-galactosyl residue carried by embryoglycan is expressed on at least some uterine cervical cancer cells. Furthermore the immune system of patients produces antibodies reacting with the alpha-galactosyl residue of embryoglycan. It would be possible to use this method in monitoring patients' specific immune respons.
n vectors have been constructed for a region of the human retinoic acid receptor-alpha (hRAR-alpha) and transferred into F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. When the vectors are overexpressed in F9 cells, clones can be selected for resistance to retinoic acid-induced differentiation. This effect is obtained even when the hRAR-alpha region is expressed as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Using the beta-galactosidase component of the fusion protein as a marker, overexpression of the fusion protein has been correlated with the retinoic acid-resistance effect. The clones resistant to retinoic acid no longer exhibit the normal retinoic acid induction of endo B cytokeratin, laminin B-1, and tissue plasminogen activator mRNAs observed with normal F9 cells. Retinoic acid induction of type IV alpha-1 collagen and Hox-1.3 RNAs is observed with these clones. When transfected with a thyroid receptor DNA-binding sequence (TRE)/thymidine kinase promoter/luciferase construct, the retinoic acid-resistant clones do not yield the same retinoic acid-induced level of luciferase obtained with F9 cells. It is hypothesized that the RAR vectors are interfering with endogenous RAR(s) in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 EC cell.
lucosaminide beta 1----4 galactosyltransferase was chromatographically purified about 1,700-fold from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells after solubilization with Triton X-100, using N-acetylglucosamine as the acceptor. As the last step of the purification, affinity chromatography was performed either on N-acetylglucosamine-Sepharose or on alpha-lactalbumin-Sepharose: in both cases, two protein bands with molecular weights of around 68,000 and 59,000 were detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified preparations. The enzymological properties including behavior toward alpha-lactalbumin were very similar to those of the enzyme from other sources. The specificity of the enzyme was confirmed by determining the structure of the product; it was mostly Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc. beta-Galactosidase-treated embryoglycan (poly-N-acetyllactosamine) and asialo-agalactofetuin could serve as acceptors with the purified enzyme. Thus, the embryonic enzyme, apparently involved in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamines, has properties similar in several respects to those of the beta-galactosyltransferases so far studie.
d ECMA 3 antigens defined by two monoclonal antibodies are preferentially expressed in early embryonic cells of the mouse. The antigens were isolated from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells by detergent solubilization followed by indirect immunoprecipitation. Both antigens were glycoproteins, which, upon extensive pronase digestion, released the high-molecular-weight glycan (embryoglycan). The immunoprecipitation reactions were inhibited by the glycan, indicating that the two antigens were carried by it. Furthermore, binding of anti-ECMA 2 antibody to the glycan was directly demonstrated by a modified Farr's assay. The antigenic determinant of ECMA 2 antigen was found to involve an alpha-galactosyl residue, since alpha-galactosidase from coffee bean, but not other glycosidases, abolished the antigenic activity. Serological experiments indicated that ECMA 2 antigen is different from other alpha-galactosyl antigens, namely blood group B and P1 antigens and an antigen defined by antibodies in the sera of patients with ovarian germ cell tumor.
nct nonoverlapping enhancer elements can be defined within the polyoma enhancer region. In mouse fibroblasts, element A provides a 3-fold higher enhancement of the alpha 2-collagen promoter than element B. In mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, element B shows the same efficiency as in fibroblasts, whereas that of element A decreases by a factor of 3.5. Moreover, a single point mutation (PyEC F9.1) increases the efficiency of element B in both cell types, making it superior to element A in embryonal carcinoma cells. The core of element A is located within a 35 bp region tandem duplicated in several wild-type strains, mostly homologous to a crucial repeated sequence of adenovirus E1a enhancer (Hearing and Shenk, 1983). Element B contains the consensus sequence of Weiher et al. (1982). These two homologies are precisely adjacent to the two DNAase l-hypersensitive sites present in viral chromati.
atients with ovarian germ cell tumors develop a specific antibody reacting with glycoprotein-bound large carbohydrates of murine teratocarcinoma cells. The antigenic determinant was found to involve an alpha-galactosyl residue, since alpha-galactosidase from coffee bean, but not other glycosidases abolished the antigenic activity of the large glycan isolated from F9 and OTT6050 cells. Several evidences excluded the possibility that the antigen is blood group B or P1 antigen. These results indicate tumor-associated expression of an unusual alpha-galactosyl residue in human ovarian germ cell tumor.
epositories of mutations that combine structural, sequence, and phenotypic information in related proteins will facilitate the diagnosis and molecular understanding of diseases associated with them. Coagulation involves the sequential activation of serine proteases and regulators in order to yield stable blood clots while maintaining hemostasis. Five coagulation serine proteases-factor VII (F7), factor IX (F9), factor X (F10), protein C (PROC), and thrombin (F2)-exhibit high sequence similarities and all require vitamin K. All five of these were incorporated into an interactive database of mutations named CoagMDB (http://www.coagMDB.org; last accessed: 9 August 2007). The large number of mutations involved (especially for factor IX) and the increasing problem of out-of-date databases required the development of new database management tools. A text mining tool automatically scans full-length references to identify and extract mutations. High recall rates between 96 and 99% and precision rates of 87 to 93% were achieved. Text mining significantly reduces the time and expertise required to maintain the databases and offers a solution to the problem of locus-specific database management and upkeep. A total of 875 mutations were extracted from 1,279 literature sources. Of these, 116 correspond to Gla domains, 86 to the N-terminal EGF domain, 73 to the C-terminal EGF domain, and 477 to the serine protease domain. The combination of text mining and consensus domain structures enables mutations to be correlated with experimentally-measurable phenotypes based on either low protein levels (Type I) or reduced functional activities (Type II), respectively. A tendency for the conservation of phenotype with structural location was identifie.
nity, specific factor IX/IXa binding to platelets is mediated at least in part by amino acids (G4-Q11) exposed on the surface of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain. Rationally designed, conformationally constrained synthetic peptides were screened for their capacity to inhibit factor IXa binding to platelets. Each of these peptides (G4-Q11, S3-L6, and F9-Q11) acted alone to inhibit factor IXa binding to approximately 50% of the 500-600 sites/platelet with Ki values of 2.9 nM (G4-Q11), 24 nM (S3-L6), and 240 nM (F9-Q11), compared with native factor IXa (Ki approximately 2.5 nM). The two peptides S3-L6 and F9-Q11 added together at equimolar concentration demonstrated approximately 50-fold synergism (Ki = 2.4 nM). Although both factor IX and the Gla peptide (G4-Q11) displaced 100% of bound factor IX and approximately 50% of bound factor IXa, factor IX was ineffective (at &gt; 1000-fold molar excess) and the Gla domain peptide (G4-Q11) was relatively ineffective (Ki = 165 microM) in inhibiting platelet receptor-mediated factor X activation by factor IXa. We conclude that the Gla domain (G4-Q11) of factor IXa contains two conformationally constrained loop structures that mediate binding of factor IX/IXa to a shared site on activated human platelets which is separate and distinct from the site used by the enzyme, factor IXa, for assembly of the factor X activating comple.
ine the methylation status of female germ cells in reference to the programmed reversal of X chromosome inactivation in these cells, we examined human fetal ovaries at developmental stages from the time germ cells initiate meiosis to when they cease to synthesize DNA (8-21 weeks gestation). Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we analyzed 57 MspI sites (32 sites in the CpG islands, and 25 nonclustered sites) from five X-linked housekeeping genes (HPRT, G6PD, P3, PGK, and GLA) and two tissue specific genes (X-linked F9 and autosomal EPO). Methylation patterns were compared to those of male germ cells, sperm, and somatic tissues of both sexes. All 32 MspI sites in CpG islands were unmethylated in germ-cell fractions of fetal ovary and adult testes, which could explain the reversibility of X inactivation in these tissues. However, whereas male meiotic germ cells were extensively methylated outside the islands (in the body of genes) and the methylation patterns resembled those of most somatic tissues, none of the 25 nonclustered CpGs was methylated in DNA contributed by the germ-cell component of fetal ovaries. The presence of faint MspI-like fragments in HpaII digests of fetal testes as well as fetal ovary prior to the onset of meiosis suggests that DNA of primordial germ cells is unmethylated in both sexes. Our observations of meiotic germ cells suggest that the female germ cells remain unmethylated, but that methylation in male germ cells occurs postnatally, prior to or during the early stages of spermatogenesis. In any event, the striking sex difference in methylation status of endogenous single-copy genes in meiotic germ cells could provide a molecular basis for parental imprinting of the mammalian genom.
nt study investigates the unique contribution of the NH2-terminal 33 residues of prothrombin, the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, to the Ca(II) and phospholipid-binding properties of prothrombin. Two Gla domain peptides, 1-42 and 1-45, produced by chymotryptic cleavage of prothrombin fragment 1 (residues 1-156 of the amino terminus of bovine prothrombin) and isolated by anion-exchange chromatography were utilized to characterize the Gla domain of prothrombin. This investigation utilized several experimental approaches to examine the properties of the Gla domain peptides. These studies were somewhat hampered by the metal ion-induced insolubility of the peptides. However, the 1-45 peptide was specifically radioiodinated, which facilitated the study of this peptide at low concentrations. In contrast to prothrombin fragment 1, the intrinsic fluorescence of both 1-42 and 1-45 was not quenched upon the addition of 1 mM Ca(II) or any concentration of Mg(II). Equilibrium dialysis studies revealed that the 1-42 peptide bound three Ca(II) ions noncooperatively, whereas fragment 1 binds seven Ca(II) ions in a positive cooperative manner. Ca(II)-promoted conformational changes are observed by comparison of electrophoretic mobility changes in the presence of increasing Ca(II) concentrations. Prothrombin, fragment 1, and the Gla domain peptides 1-42 and 1-45 exhibited similar electrophoretic mobility behavior in the presence of Ca(II) ions. The radiolabeled 1-45 peptide was found to comigrate with phospholipid vesicles on gel permeation chromatography in the presence of Ca(II). Fragment 1 was shown to inhibit this Ca(II)-dependent phospholipid binding of 1-45, demonstrating that the 1-45 peptide does possess the necessary phospholipid-binding structure. Furthermore, a metal ion-dependent conformational monoclonal antibody, F9.29, was inhibited from binding fragment 1 by the 1-42 peptid.
tructures of factor (F) VIIa/soluble tissue factor (TF), obtained under high Mg(2+) (50mM Mg(2+)/5mM Ca(2+)), have three of seven Ca(2+) sites in the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain replaced by Mg(2+) at positions 1, 4, and 7. We now report structures under low Mg(2+) (2.5mM Mg(2+)/5mM Ca(2+)) as well as under high Ca(2+) (5mM Mg(2+)/45 mM Ca(2+)). Under low Mg(2+), four Ca(2+) and three Mg(2+) occupy the same positions as in high-Mg(2+) structures. Conversely, under low Mg(2+), reexamination of the structure of Gla domain of activated Protein C (APC) complexed with soluble endothelial Protein C receptor (sEPCR) has position 4 occupied by Ca(2+) and positions 1 and 7 by Mg(2+). Nonetheless, in direct binding experiments, Mg(2+) replaced three Ca(2+) sites in the unliganded Protein C or APC. Further, the high-Ca(2+) condition was necessary to replace Mg4 in the FVIIa/soluble TF structure. In biological studies, Mg(2+) enhanced phospholipid binding to FVIIa and APC at physiological Ca(2+). Additionally, Mg(2+) potentiated phospholipid-dependent activations of FIX and FX by FVIIa/TF and inactivation of activated factor V by APC. Since APC and FVIIa bind to sEPCR involving similar interactions, we conclude that under the low-Mg(2+) condition, sEPCR binding to APC-Gla (or FVIIa-Gla) replaces Mg4 by Ca4 with an attendant conformational change in the Gla domain ω-loop. Moreover, since phospholipid and sEPCR bind to FVIIa or APC via the ω-loop, we predict that phospholipid binding also induces the functional Ca4 conformation in this loop. Cumulatively, the data illustrate that Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) act in concert to promote coagulation and anticoagulatio.
 binds to collagen type IV, but this binding has no known consequenc.
ine the effect of reduced binding of FIX to collagen I.
ucted and characterized 'knock-in' mice containing the mutation lysine 5 to alanine (K5A) in the Gla domain of their FIX. The K5A mutation dramatically reduced the affinity of FIX for collagen type IV, but had no measurable effect on platelet binding, phospholipid binding, or in vitro clotting activity. However, K5AFIX mice had a mild bleeding tendency, despite their in vitro clotting activity being normal. Hemostatic protection from delayed rebleeding was intermediate between wild-type and hemophilia B mice (which had no detectable clotting activity); moreover, survival of K5A FIX mice after nascent clot removal was dramatically improved as compared with hemophilia B mice. Importantly, there was no detectable difference between K5AFIX and wild-type mice in either a laser-induced thrombosis model or the chromogenic FIX activity assay. In contrast, after ferric chloride injury, which exposes collagen IV as well as other basement membrane proteins, intravital microscopy revealed that vessel occlusion was significantly slower in K5AFIX mice than in wild-type mic.
ts indicate that the FIX molecule with decreased affinity for collagen IV has altered hemostatic properties in vivo and that the binding of FIX to collagen IV probably plays a significant functional role in hemostasi.
on factor IX (FIX) is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease, which plays a key role in the coagulation cascade. The rhesus monkey may be an indispensable substitute for humans in research of pig-to-human xenotransplantation, due to its close relationship. But the coagulation function concordance between rhesus monkey and human is unknown. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of rhesus monkey FIX (rFIX) to investigate the genomic backgrounds of the coagulation system.
 the full-length cDNA from the cDNA library of rhesus monkey liver tissue. Polymerase chain reaction was used to screen the positive clones. Based on a partial sequence obtained by cDNA library screening and a homologous sequence from the database, we designed a second pair of primers to obtain the full sequence. For further analysis of rFIX, we used several online ExPASy Proteomic tool.
ed the full-length cDNA of rFIX, which has 2668 nucleotides, predicting an open reading frame of 1383 nucleotides corresponding to 461 amino acids. The deduced protein sequence indicated functional domains of signal peptide, Gla, two epidermal growth factor, and trypsin-like serine protease, which were consisted with those of human FIX (hFIX). Sequence alignments showed that rFIX is highly homologous to hFIX with nucleotide identity of 96% and amino acid identity of 97.
eport herein the full-length cDNA of rFIX. The high homology between rhesus monkey and human coagulation factor ensure the reliability and feasibility of rhesus monkey as a recipient in studies on coagulation disorders in xenotransplantatio.
ased on adeno-associated virus-8 (AAV8) have shown efficiency and efficacy for liver-directed gene therapy protocols following intravascular injection, particularly in relation to haemophilia gene therapy. AAV8 has also been proposed for gene therapy targeted at skeletal and cardiac muscle, again via intravascular injection. It is important to assess vector targeting at the level of virion accumulation and transgene expression in multiple species to ascertain potential issues relating to species variation in infectivity profile.
AV8 vectors expressing human factor IX (FIX) from the liver-specific LP-1 promoter and administered this virus via the intravascular route of injection into 12 week old Wistar Kyoto rats. We assessed FIX levels in serum by ELISA and transgene expression at sacrifice by immunohistochemistry using anti-FIX antibodies. Vector DNA levels in organs we determined by real time PC.
ation of 1 x 10(11) or 5 x 10(11) scAAV8-LP1-hFIX vector particles/rat resulted in efficient production of physiological hFIX levels, respectively in blood assessed 4 weeks post-injection. This was maintained for the 4 month duration of the study. At 4 months we observed liver persistence of vector with minimal non-hepatic distributio.
ts demonstrate that AAV8 is a robust vector for delivering therapeutic genes into rat liver following intravascular injectio.
the in vitro selection method SELEX against the complex mixture of GLA proteins and utilizing methods to deconvolute the resulting ligands, we were able to successfully generate 2'-ribo purine, 2'-fluoro pyrimidine aptamers to various individual targets in the GLA protein proteome that ranged in concentration from 10 nM to 1.4 microM in plasma. Perhaps not unexpectedly, the majority of the aptamers isolated following SELEX bind the most abundant protein in the mixture, prothrombin (FII), with high affinity. We show that by deselecting the dominant prothrombin aptamer the selection can be redirected. By using this DeSELEX approach, we were able to shift the selection toward other sequences and to less abundant protein targets and obtained an aptamer to Factor IX (FIX). We also demonstrate that by using an RNA library that is focused around a proteome, purified protein targets can then be used to rapidly generate aptamers to the protein targets that are rare in the initial mixture such as Factor VII (FVII) and Factor X (FX). Moreover, for all four proteins targeted (FII, FVII, FIX, and FX), aptamers were identified that could inhibit the individual protein's activitity in coagulation assays. Thus, by applying the concepts of DeSELEX and focused library selection, aptamers specific for any protein in a particular proteome can theoretically be generated, even when the proteins in the mixture are present at very different concentration.
usly reported that the first epidermal growth factor-like (EGF1) domain in factor X (FX) or factor IX (FIX) plays an important role in the factor VIIa/tissue factor (FVIIa/TF)-induced coagulation. To assess the role of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domains of FX and FIX in FVIIa/TF induced coagulation, we studied four new and two previously described replacement mutants: FX(PCGla) and FIX(PCGla) (Gla domain replaced with that of protein C), FX(PCEGF1) and FIX(PCEGF1) (EGF1 domain replaced with that of protein C), as well as FX(PCGla/EGF1) and FIX(PCGla/EGF1) (both Gla and EGF1 domains replaced with those of protein C). FVIIa/TF activation of each FX mutant and the corresponding reciprocal activation of FVII/TF by each FXa mutant were impaired. In contrast, FVIIa/TF activation of FIX(PCGla) was minimally affected, and the reciprocal activation of FVII/TF by FIXa(PCGla) was normal; however, both reactions were impaired for the FIX(PCEGF1) and FIX(PCGla/EGF1) mutants. Predictably, FXIa activation of FIX(PCEGF1) was normal, whereas it was impaired for the FIX(PCGla) and FIX(PCGla/EGF1) mutants. Molecular models reveal that alternate interactions exist for the Gla domain of protein C such that it is comparable with FIX but not FX in its binding to FVIIa/TF. Further, additional interactions exist for the EGF1 domain of FX, which are not possible for FIX. Importantly, a seven-residue insertion in the EGF1 domain of protein C prevents its interaction with FVIIa/TF. Cumulatively, our data provide a molecular framework demonstrating that the Gla and EGF1 domains of FX interact more strongly with FVIIa/TF than the corresponding domains in FI.
ng of factor IX to cell membranes requires a structured N-terminal omega-loop conformation that exposes hydrophobic residues for a highly regulated interaction with a phospholipid. We hypothesized that a peptide comprised of amino acids Gly4-Gln11 of factor IX (fIX(G4)(-)(Q11)) and constrained by an engineered disulfide bond would assume the native factor IX omega-loop conformation in the absence of Ca(2+). The small size and freedom from aggregation-inducing calcium interactions would make fIX(G4)(-)(Q11) suitable for structural studies for eliciting details about phospholipid interactions. fIX(G4)(-)(Q11) competes with factor IXa for binding sites on phosphatidylserine-containing membranes with a K(i) of 11 microM and inhibits the activation of factor X by the factor VIIIa-IXa complex with a K(i) of 285 microM. The NMR structure of fIX(G4)(-)(Q11) reveals an omega-loop backbone fold and side chain orientation similar to those found in the calcium-bound factor IX Gla domain, FIX(1-47)-Ca(2+). Dicaproylphosphatidylserine (C(6)PS) induces HN, Halpha backbone, and Hbeta chemical shift perturbations at residues Lys5, Leu6, Phe9, and Val10 of fIX(G4)(-)(Q11), while selectively protecting the NHzeta side chain resonance of Lys5 from solvent exchange. NOEs between the aromatic ring protons of Phe9 and specific acyl chain protons of C(6)PS indicate that these phosphatidylserine protons reside 3-6 A from Phe9. Stabilization of the phosphoserine headgroup and glycerol backbone of C(6)PS identifies that phosphatidylserine is in a protected environment that is spatially juxtaposed with fIX(G4)(-)(Q11). Together, these data demonstrate that Lys5, Leu6, Phe9, and Val10 preferentially interact with C(6)PS and allow us to correlate known hemophilia B mutations of factor IX at Lys5 or Phe9 with impaired phosphatidylserine interactio.
va is a rich source of molecules with antiinflammatory, antihemostatic and immunosupressive properties. In this paper, a novel tick salivary gland cDNA with sequence homology to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and coding for a protein called Penthalaris has been characterized from the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis. Penthalaris is structurally unique and distinct from TFPI or TFPI-like molecules described so far, including Ixolaris, NAPc2, TFPI-1 and TFPI-2. Penthalaris is a 308-amino-acid protein (35 kDa, pI 8.58) with 12 cysteine bridges and 5 tandem Kunitz domains. Recombinant Penthalaris was expressed in insect cells and shown to inhibit factor VIIa (FVIIa)/tissue factor(TF)-induced factor X (FX) activation with an IC50 of approximately 100 pM. Penthalaris tightly binds both zymogen FX and enzyme FXa (exosite), but not FVIIa, as demonstrated by column gel-filtration chromatography. At high concentrations, Penthalaris attenuates FVIIa/TF-induced chromogenic substrate (S2288) hydrolysis and FIX activation. In the presence of DEGR-FX or DEGR-FXa, but not des-Gla-DEGR-FXa as scaf-folds, tight and stoichiometric inhibition of FVIIa/TF was achieved. In addition, Penthalaris blocks cell surface-mediated FXa generation by monomer (de-encrypted), but not dimer (encrypted) TF in HL-60 cells. Penthalaris may act in concert with Ixolaris and other salivary anti-hemostatics in order to help ticks to successfully feed on blood. Penthalaris is a novel anticoagulant and a tool to study FVIIa/TF-initiated biologic processe.
es of the vitamin K-dependent proteins bind to an exosite on gamma-glutamyl carboxylase; while they are bound, multiple glutamic acids in the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain are carboxylated. The role of the propeptides has been studied extensively; however, the role of the Gla domain in substrate binding is less well understood. We used kinetic and fluorescence techniques to investigate the interactions of the carboxylase with a substrate containing the propeptide and Gla domain of factor IX (FIXproGla41). In addition, we characterized the effect of the Gla domain and carboxylation on propeptide and substrate binding. For the propeptide of factor IX (proFIX18), FIXproGla41, and carboxylated FIXproGla41, the Kd values were 50, 2.5, and 19.7 nM and the koff values were 273 x 10(-5), 9 x 10(-5), and 37 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively. The koff of proFIX18 is reduced 3-fold by FLEEL and 9-fold by the Gla domain (residues 1-46) of FIX. The pre-steady state rate constants for carboxylation of FIXproGla41 was 0.02 s(-1) in enzyme excess and 0.016 s(-1) in substrate excess. The steady state rate in substrate excess is 4.5 x 10(-4) s(-1). These results demonstrate the following. 1) The pre-steady state carboxylation rate constant of FIXproGla41 is significantly slower than that of FLEEL. 2) The Gla domain plays an allosteric role in substrate-enzyme interactions. 3) Carboxylation reduces the allosteric effect. 4) The similarity between the steady state carboxylation rate constant and product dissociation rate constant suggests that product release is rate-limiting. 5) The increased dissociation rate after carboxylation contributes to the release of produc.
oleum hydrocarbons contaminate soil, the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio of the soil is altered. The added carbon stimulates microbial numbers but causes an imbalance in the C:N ratio which may result in immobilization of soil nitrogen by the microbial biomass, leaving none available for plant growth. As members of Leguminosae fix atmospheric nitrogen to produce their own nitrogen for growth, they may prove more successful at growing on petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites. During a wider study on phytoremediation of diesel fuel contaminated soil, particular attention was given to the performance of legumes versus other plant species. During harvesting of pot experiments containing leguminous plants, a recurring difference in the number and formation of root nodules present on control and contaminated Common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) plants was observed. The total number of nodules per plant was significant reduced in contaminated plants compared to control plants but nodules on contaminated plants were more developed than corresponding nodules on control plants. Plant performance of Common vetch and Westerwold's ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) was compared to illustrate any difference between the ability of legumes and grasses to grow on diesel fuel contaminated soil. Common vetch was less affected by diesel fuel and performed better in low levels of diesel fuel contaminated soil than Westerwold's ryegrass. The total amount of diesel fuel remaining after 4 months in Common vetch planted soil was slightly less than in Westerwold's ryegrass planted soi.
ian blood coagulation, five proteases (factor VII [FVII]; factor IX [FIX]; factor X [FX]; protein C [PC] and prothrombin [PT]) act with five cofactors (tissue factor [TF]; factor V [FV]; factor VIII [FVIII]; thrombomodulin and protein S) to control the generation of fibrin. Biochemical evidence, molecular cloning data and comparative sequence analysis support the existence of all components of this network in all jawed vertebrates, and strongly suggest that it evolved before the divergence of teleosts over 430 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the Gla-EGF1-EGF2-SP domain serine proteases (FVII, FIX, FX, PC) and the A domain-containing cofactors (FV and FVIII) strongly supports the evolution of the blood coagulation network through two rounds of gene duplication, and supports the hypothesis that vertebrate evolution benefited from two global genome duplications. The jawless vertebrates (hagfish and lamprey) that diverged over 450 million years ago have a blood coagulation network involving TF, PT and fibrinogen. Preliminary evidence indicates that they may have a smaller complement of Gla-EGF1-EGF2-SP domain proteins, suggesting the existence of a 'primitive' coagulation system in jawless vertebrate.
-1, and LIMPII are single polypeptide membrane glycoproteins, and the genes encoding them constitute a recently described gene family (D. Calvo and M. A. Vega (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268: 18929). In the present paper, a cDNA encoding the human lysosomal membrane protein LIMPII was used to determine its expression pattern in cells of various lineages. Like CLA-1, and in contrast with the restricted expression of CD36, the expression of LIMPII is widespread. Mapping of the human LIMPII and CLA-1 genes (gene symbols CD36L2 and CD36L1, respectively) to specific chromosomes revealed that CLA-1, LIMPII, and CD36 do not form a gene cluster, but are found dispersed on chromosomes 12, 4, and 7, respectively. These data, together with the phylogenetic analysis carried out for the members of this family, indicate that the LIMPII, CLA-1, and CD36 genes diverged early in evolution from an ancestor gene, possibly before the divergence between the arthropods and the vertebrate.
ngth cDNA for a human lysosomal membrane sialoglycoprotein (hLGP85) was isolated as a probe of the cDNA of rat LGP85 (rLGP85) from the cDNA library prepared from total mRNA of QGP-1NL cells, a human pancreatic islet tumor cell with a high metastatic activity. The deduced amino acid sequence shows that hLGP85 consists of 478 amino acid residues (MW. 54,289). The protein has 10 putative N-glycosylation sites and 2 hydrophobic regions at the NH2- and near the COOH-termini, respectively. Thus, both domains probably constitute putative transmembrane domains. It exhibits 86% and 79% sequence similarities in amino acids and nucleic acids to rat lysosomal membrane sialoglycoprotein (rLGP85), respectively. The protein contained the short cytoplasmic tail at the COOH-terminus which does not form the glycine-tyrosine sequence (GY motif), the so-called lysosomal targetting signa.
LIMPII analog 1, CLA-1, and its splicing variant, CLA-2 (SR-BI and SR-BII in rodents), are human high density lipoprotein receptors with an identical extracellular domain which binds a spectrum of ligands including bacterial cell wall components. In this study, CLA-1- and CLA-2-stably transfected HeLa and HEK293 cells demonstrated several-fold increases in the uptake of various bacteria over mock-transfected cells. All bacteria tested, including both Gram-negatives (Escherichia coli K12, K1 and Salmonella typhimurium) and Gram-positives (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes), demonstrated various degrees of lower uptake in control cells. This result is consistent with the presence of high-density lipoprotein-receptor-independent bacterial uptake that is enhanced by CLA-1/CLA-2 overexpression. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acid, and synthetic amphipathic helical peptides (L-37pA and D-37pA) competed with E. coli K12 for CLA-1 and CLA-2 binding. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed cytosolic accumulation of bacteria in CLA-1/CLA-2-overexpressing HeLa cells. The antibiotic protection assay confirmed that E. coli K12 was able to survive and replicate intracellularly in CLA-1- and CLA-2-overexpressing HeLa, but both L-37pA and D-37pA prevented E. coli K12 invasion. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from SR-BI/BII-knockout mice demonstrated a 30% decrease in bacterial uptake when compared with macrophages from normal mice. Knockout macrophages were also characterized by decreased bacterial cytosolic invasion, ubiquitination, and proteasome mobilization while retaining bacterial lysosomal accumulation. These results indicate that, by facilitating bacterial adhesion and cytosolic invasion, CLA-1 and CLA-2 may play an important role in infection and sepsi.
ible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) can be ameliorated by prion protein (PrP)-specific antibodies, but active immunization is complicated by immune tolerance to the normal cellular host protein (PrP(C)). Here, we show that DNA immunization of wild-type mice can break immune tolerance against the prion protein, resulting in the induction of PrP-specific antibody and T-cell responses. PrP immunogenicity was increased by fusion to the lysosomal targeting signal from LIMPII (lysosomal integral membrane protein type II). Although mice immunized with a PrP-LIMPII DNA vaccine showed a dramatic delay in the onset of early disease signs after intracerebral challenge, immunization against PrP also had some deleterious effects. These results clearly confirm the feasibility of using active immunization to protect against TSEs and, in the absence of effective treatments, indicate a suitable alternative for combating the spread of these disease.
reviously shown that overexpression of LIM kinase1 (LIMK1) resulted in a marked retardation of the internalization of the receptor-mediated endocytic tracer, Texas red-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) in low-invasive human breast cancer cell MCF-7. We thereby postulate that LIMK1 signaling plays an important role in the regulation of ligand-induced endocytosis of EGF receptor (EGFR) in tumor cells by reorganizing and influencing actin-filament dynamics. In the present study, we further assessed the effect of wild-type LIMK1, a kinase-deficient dominant negative mutant of LIMK1 (DN-LIMK1) and an active, unphosphorylatable cofilin mutant (S3A cofilin) on internalization of EGF-EGFR in MDA-MB-231, a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line. We demonstrate here that a marked delay in the receptor-mediated internalization of Texas red-labeled EGF was observed in the wild-type LIMK1 transfectants, and that most of the internalized EGF staining were accumulated within transferrin receptor-positive early endosomes even after 30 min internalization. In contrast, the expression of dominant-negative LIMK1 mutant rescued the efficient endocytosis of Texas red-EGF, and large amounts of Texas red-EGF staining already reached LIMPII-positive late endosomes/lysosomal vacuoles after 15 min internalization. We further analyzed the effect of S3A cofilin mutant on EGFR trafficking, and found an efficient delivery of Texas red-EGF into late endosomes/lysosomes at 15-30 min after internalization. Taken together, our novel findings presented in this paper implicate that LIMK1 signaling indeed plays a pivotal role in the regulation of EGFR trafficking through the endocytic pathway in invasive tumor cell.
oot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) being responsible for one of the most devastating animal diseases, little is known about the cellular immune mechanisms involved in protection against this virus. In this work we have studied the potential of DNA vaccines based on viral minigenes corresponding to three major B and T-cell FMDV epitopes (isolate C-S8c1) originally identified in natural hosts. The BTT epitopes [VP1 (133-156)-3A (11-40)-VP4 (20-34)] were cloned into the plasmid pCMV, either alone or fused to ubiquitin, the lysosomal targeting signal from LIMPII, a soluble version of CTLA4 or a signal peptide from the human prion protein, to analyze the effect of processing through different antigenic presentation pathways on the immunogenicity of the FMDV epitopes. As a first step in the analysis of modulation exerted by these target signals, a FMDV infection inhibition assay in Swiss outbred mice was developed and used to analyze the protection conferred by the different BTT-expressing plasmids. Only one of the 37 mice immunized with minigene-bearing plasmids developed specific neutralizing antibodies prior to FMDV challenge. As expected, this single mouse that had been immunized with the BTT tandem epitopes fused to a signal peptide (pCMV-spBTT) was protected against FMDV infection. Interestingly, nine more of the animals immunized with BTT-expressing plasmids did not show viremia at 48 h post-infection (pi), even in the absence of anti-FMDV antibodies prior to challenge. The highest protection (50%, six out of 12 mice) was observed with the plasmid expressing BTT alone, indicating that the targeting strategies used did not result in an improvement of the protection conferred by BTT epitopes. Interestingly, peptide specific CD4+ T-cells were detected for some of the BTT-protected mice. Thus, a DNA vaccine based on single FMDV B and T cell epitopes can protect mice, in the absence of specific antibodies at the time of challenge. Further work must be done to elucidate the mechanisms involved in protection and to determine the protective potential of these vaccines in natural FMDV host.
ture of several lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (lamp1, lamp2, limpI and limpII) has been described. The significance of the receptor glycoprotein lamp2a in the chaperone-mediated autophagy of cytosolic proteins with KFERQ motif has been described in details as well as the chaperone protein Hsc73 and other chaperones involved in this process. Several modulatory mechanisms of the chaperone-mediated autophagy, which is activated in condition of stress and starvation, were also outline.
e (LIMK) plays a critical role in stimulus-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton by linking signals from the Rho family GTPases to changes in cofilin activity. Recent studies have shown an important role for LIMK1 signaling in tumor cell invasion through regulating actin dynamics. In this study, we investigate the role of LIMK1 in intracellular vesicle trafficking of lysosomes/endosomes. We analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy the cellular distribution of lysosomal proteins and the endocytosis of an endocytic tracer, epidermal growth factor (EGF), in LIMK1-transfected cells. We found in these cells an abnormal dispersed translocation of lysosomes stained for LIMPII and cathepsin D throughout the cytoplasm. The small punctate structures that stained for these lysosomal proteins were redistributed to the periphery of the cell. Computational 3D-image analysis of confocal immunofluorescence micrographs further demonstrated that these vesicles did not colocalize with the transferrin receptor, an early endosomal marker. Furthermore, LIMPII-positive lysosomes did not colocalize with early endosomes labeled with endocytosed Texas red-transferrin. These results indicate that there is no mixing between dispersed lysosomes and early endosomes in the LIMK1-transfected cells. Moreover, LIMK1 overexpression resulted in a marked retardation in the receptor-mediated internalization of Texas red-labeled EGF in comparison with mock-transfected cells. At 30 min after internalization, most of the Texas red-EGF staining overlapped with LIMPII-positive late endosomes/lysosomes in mock-transfected cells, whereas in LIMK1 transfectants only a small fraction of internalized EGF colocalized with LIMPII-positive structures in the perinuclear region. Taken together, the findings presented in this paper suggest that LIMK1 has a role in regulating vesicle trafficking of lysosomes and endosomes in invasive tumor cell.
ase Rho and its downstream effectors, ROCK family of Rho-associated serine-threonine kinases, are thought to participate in cell morphology, motility, and tumor progression through regulating the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton. Here we present evidence that transfection of human breast cancer cells with cDNA encoding a dominant active mutant of ROCK causes dispersal of lysosomal vesicles throughout the cytoplasm without perturbing the machinery of the endocytic pathway. The intracellular distribution of lysosomes and endocytosed transferrin, an early endosomal marker, were further assessed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In the active ROCK transfected cells the lysosomal proteins, cathepsin D, LIMPII, and LAMP1, were found throughout the cytoplasm in dispersed small vesicles, which were accessible to the endocytosed Texas Red-labeled transferrin. 3D-image analysis of lysosomal distribution in the active ROCK transfectants revealed abundant punctate signals in the peripheral region of the basal plasma membrane. Cells expressing vector alone did not exhibit these alterations. Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, induced LIMPII-positive/ transferrin negative large vacuoles in the perinuclear region, and disappearence of the dispersed small vesicular structures. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that increasing ROCK expression contributes to selective cellular dispersion of lysosomes in invasive breast cancer cell.
ased motifs mediate the sorting of membrane proteins at such cellular sites as the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and plasma membrane. A Leu paired with a second Leu, Ile, or Met, while itself lacking the ability to mediate transport, is the key structural feature in these motifs. Here we have studied the structural differences between the leucine-based motifs contained in the COOH tails of LIMPII and GLUT4, two membrane proteins that are transported through the secretory pathway and are targeted to lysosomes () and to a perinuclear compartment adjacent to the Golgi complex (), respectively. LIMPII and GLUT4 display negatively (Asp(470)/Glu(471)) and positively (Arg(484)/Arg(485)) charged residues, respectively, at positions -4 and -5 upstream from the critical Leu residue. The change in the charge sign of residues -4 and -5 results in missorting of LIMPII and GLUT4. We note that the acidic Glu residue at position -4 is critical for efficient intracellular sorting of LIMPII to lysosomes, but is dispensable for its surface internalization by endocytosis. Efficient intracellular sorting and endocytosis of GLUT4 require an Arg pair between positions -4 and -7. These results are consistent with the existence of distinct leucine-based motifs and provide evidence of their different readings at different cellular site.
ysosomal integral membrane protein II) is one of a family of proteins structurally related to the cell surface glycoprotein CD36. We recently defined a single structural domain on CD36 that mediates binding to adhesive glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). The CD36-TSP1 interaction is known to play a role in platelet-tumor and platelet-monocyte adhesion, angiogenesis, and in monocyte uptake of apoptotic cells. To test whether LIMPII also binds TSP1, a LIMPII peptide corresponding to the TSP1 binding domain of CD36 was expressed as a recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. In solid phase binding assays, purified 125I-TSP1 bound to immobilized GST/LIMPII in a time-dependent and saturable manner. Inhibition by excess unlabeled TSP1 or EDTA demonstrated specificity. LIMPII.TSP1 complex formation was specifically blocked by soluble LIMPII fusion protein, by monospecific rabbit IgG directed against the LIMPII peptide and by CD36 fusion proteins containing the TSP1 binding domain. Transfection of Bowes melanoma cells with a chimeric LIMPII cDNA that targets expression to the plasma membrane conferred the ability to bind 125I-TSP1 and to adhere to TSP1-coated surfaces. This study defines a TSP1 binding site conserved between LIMPII and CD36 and suggests that cell surface LIMPII may function in some circumstances as an adhesion receptor for TSP1. Computer-assisted homology searches suggest that the TSP1 recognition motif identified from study of CD36 family members may be widely expressed in natur.
bospondin and collagen type I receptor CD36 is a plasma membrane glycoprotein present in a restricted number of cell types. By contrast, rat lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMPII) is expressed on the membrane of lysosomes in all cell types so far examined. Nevertheless, both belong to the same gene family based on alignment of their respective amino acid sequences. To explore the existence of other related members, we have used the polymerase chain reaction with primers derived from highly conserved amino acid regions between CD36 and rat LIMPII. A human cDNA corresponding to a novel member of this family has been identified and isolated. This new member has been designated as CD36 and LIMPII Analogous-1 (CLA-1). Human CLA-1 cDNA predicts a protein 409 amino acids long with a 20% amino acid identity with CD36 and rat LIMPII. Further studies revealed that the sequenced cDNA clone may result by alternative splicing from a longer mRNA form having an insertion of 300 nucleotides located 126 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon of cloned CLA-1. This form would encode a protein 509 amino acids long, whose sequence matches without any long gap to amino acid sequences of CD36 and rat LIMPII. Northern blot analysis indicates that CLA-1 is widely expressed although its mRNA steady state levels vary considerably among the analyzed cell types. Transient transfection experiments of a CD36-CLA-1 chimera, constructed by replacing the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of CD36 for the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of CLA-1, suggest that native CLA-1 protein is found on the plasma membran.
nger receptor class B isoforms (SR-B) type I and type II mediate the selective uptake of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and promote reverse cholesterol transport, an important atherosclerosis protection mechanism, in the liver. Previously it was shown that the hepatic expression of SR-BI and SR-BII is regulated by estrogen. In the present study, we demonstrate that estrogen differentially regulates expression of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of SR-BI and SR-BII in rat liver and hepatic cells. We report that estrogen mainly induces the down-regulation of glycosylated SR-BI and the up-regulation of nonglycosylated SR-BII. To study how estrogen regulates expression of the SR-B isoforms, we constructed a SR-B minigene containing minimal genomic sequences and were able to demonstrate that estrogen directly regulates the pre-mRNA alternative splicing of the exogenously expressed SR-B minigene in hepatic cells. Furthermore, we showed that the overexpression of splicing factors alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2, Transformer (Tra)-2alpha, and Tra2beta changes the splicing pattern of SR-B dramatically, whereas other splicing factors, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-G, SC-35, and arginine/serine-rich p40, had no effect. We also demonstrate that estrogen regulates Tra2beta expression levels in liver cells. These studies suggest that estrogen may regulate SR-B isoform expression at both the RNA splicing and posttranslational modification levels and that, for alternative splicing regulation, estrogen may function by regulating the expression of the splicing factors alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2, Tra2alpha, and especially Tra2bet.
 C virus (HCV) enters cells via a pH- and clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. Scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and CD81 are important entry factors for HCV internalization into target cells. The SR-BI gene gives rise to at least two mRNA splice variants, SR-BI and SR-BII, which differ in their C termini. SR-BI internalization remains poorly understood, but SR-BII is reported to endocytose via a clathrin-dependent pathway, making it an attractive target for HCV internalization. We demonstrate that HCV soluble E2 can interact with human SR-BI and SR-BII. Increased expression of SR-BI and SR-BII in the Huh-7.5 hepatoma cell line enhanced HCV strain J6/JFH and JFH infectivity, suggesting that endogenous levels of these receptors limit infection. Elevated expression of SR-BI, but not SR-BII, increased the rate of J6/JFH infection, which may reflect altered intracellular trafficking of the splice variants. In human plasma, HCV particles have been reported to be complexed with lipoproteins, suggesting an indirect interaction of the virus with SR-BI and other lipoprotein receptors. Plasma from J6/JFH-infected uPA-SCID mice transplanted with human hepatocytes demonstrates an increased infectivity for SR-BI/II-overexpressing Huh-7.5 cells. Plasma-derived J6/JFH infectivity was inhibited by an anti-E2 monoclonal antibody, suggesting that plasma virus interaction with SR-BI was glycoprotein dependent. Finally, anti-SR-BI antibodies inhibited the infectivity of cell culture- and plasma-derived J6/JFH, suggesting a critical role for SR-BI/II in HCV infectio.
mpanion paper we demonstrated that circulating lipoproteins enter the retina via the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and possibly Müller cells. In order to understand how these lipids are transported within the retina, expression and localization of the main proteins known to be involved in systemic lipid transport was determine.
n of ABCA1, apoA1 (the major HDL protein), SR-BI, SR-BII, CD36, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblots. Localization was determined by immunohistochemistry using fresh monkey vibrotome sections and imaged by confocal microscop.
 apoA1 were localized to the ganglion cell layer, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and rod photoreceptor inner segments. ApoA1 was also observed associated with rod photoreceptor outer segments, presumably localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM). The scavenger receptors SR-BI and SR-BII localized mainly to the ganglion cell layer and photoreceptor outer segments; in the latter they appear to be associated with microtubules. LCAT and CETP localized mainly to the IP.
nce and specific localization of these well-known lipid transport proteins suggest that the retina employs an internal lipid transport mechanism that involves processing and maturation of HDL-like particle.
density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor Scavenger Receptor BII (SR-BII) is encoded by an alternatively spliced mRNA from the SR-BI gene and is expressed in various tissues. SR-BII protein differs from SR-BI only in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail, which, as we showed previously, must contain a signal that confers predominant intracellular expression and rapid endocytosis of HDL. We have shown that SR-BII mediates HDL endocytosis through aclathrin-dependent, caveolae-independent pathway. Two candidate amino acid motifs were identified in the tail that could mediate association with clathrin-containing endocytic vesicles: a putative dileucine motif at position 492-493 and an overlapping tyrosine-based YXXZ motif starting at position 489. Although substitution of tyrosine at position 489 with alanine or histidine did not affect endocytosis, substitution L492A resulted in increased surface binding of HDL and reduced HDL particle endocytosis. Substitution L493A had a less dramatic effect. No other regions in the carboxyl-terminal tail appeared to contain motifs required for HDL endocytosis. Substitutions of leucine at position 492 with the hydrophobic amino acids valine or phenylalanine also reduced HDL endocytosis, stressing the importance of leucine at this position. Introducing the SR-BII YTPLL motif into the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of SR-BI converted SR-BI into an endocytic receptor resembling SR-BII. These results demonstrated that SR-BII differs from SR-BI in subcellular localization and trafficking and suggest that the two isoforms differ in the manner in which they target ligands intracellularl.
ctive role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the cardiovascular system is related to its role in the reverse transport of cholesterol from the arterial wall to the liver for subsequent excretion via the bile. Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) binds HDL and mediates selective uptake of cholesterol ester and cellular efflux of cholesterol to HDL. The role of SR-BI in atherosclerosis has been well established in murine models but it remains unclear whether SR-BI plays an equally important role in atherosclerosis in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of SR-BI and its isoforms in human macrophages and atherosclerotic plaque.
t of hypoxia and minimally modified low-density lipoprotein (mmLDL), two proatherogenic stimuli, on SR-BI expression was studied in human monocyte-derived macrophages from healthy subjects using real-time PCR. In addition, SR-BI expression was determined in macrophages obtained from subjects with atherosclerosis (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15). Expression of SR-BI isoforms was characterized in human atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages using RT-PCR and DNA sequencin.
ression was decreased in macrophages after hypoxia (p &lt; 0.005). In contrast, SR-BI expression was increased by exposure to mmLDL (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in SR-BI expression in macrophages from patients with atherosclerosis compared to controls. In both groups, SR-BI expression was increased by exposure to mmLDL (p &lt; 0.05). Transcripts corresponding to SR-BI and SR-BII were detected in macrophages. In addition, a third isoform, referred to as SR-BIII, was discovered. All three isoforms were also expressed in human atherosclerotic plaque. Compared to the other isoforms, the novel SR-BIII isoform was predicted to have a unique intracellular C-terminal domain containing 53 amino acid.
de that SR-BI is regulated by proatherogenic stimuli in humans. However, we found no differences between subjects with atherosclerosis and healthy controls. This indicates that altered SR-BI expression is not a common cause of atherosclerosis. In addition, we identified SR-BIII as a novel isoform expressed in human macrophages and in human atherosclerotic plaque.
athogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, survive within the hostile intracellular environment of a macrophage. To identify host factors required for mycobacterial entry and survival within macrophages, we performed a genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila macrophage-like cells, using Mycobacterium fortuitum. We identified factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those needed specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor, Peste (Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of mycobacteria, but not Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger receptors (SRs) conferred uptake of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells, with SR-BI and SR-BII uniquely mediating uptake of M. fortuitum, which suggests a conserved role for class B SRs in pattern recognition and innate immunit.
monitoring of organ-transplant recipients suggests that administration of cyclosporine (CsA) may increase the risk of atherosclerosis when compared with the general population. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the utility of the in vitro Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP)-1 human monocyte cell culture model for determining drug-related atherosclerotic potential in macrophages. The effect of CsA on the mRNA expression of macrophage scavenger receptor genes including CD36, CD68, scavenger receptor (SR)-A, SR-BII, and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LOX-1); the nuclear hormone receptors, including peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)gamma and liver-X-receptor (LXR)alpha; and the cholesterol efflux pump ABCA1 were investigated as markers of atherosclerotic progression. The THP-1 cells were cultured and differentiated into macrophages. The macrophages were then treated with CsA to assess gene expression. Time- (1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours) and dose- (concentrations [mg/L] corresponding to the trough [0.5], peak [1.25] and 4x peak [5]) dependency of CsA was assessed. The treated macrophage mRNA gene expression of CD36, CD68, and PPARgamma were up-regulated in the presence of CsA. Interestingly, SR-A, SR-BII, LOX-1, and LXRalpha expression appeared to be slightly down-regulated, and ABCA1 was relatively unchanged. Immunoblotting studies demonstrated that the protein expression of CD36 was unchanged or increased, PPARgamma was unchanged, and ABCA1 was unchanged or decreased at 4 and 8 hours. The results document CsA-induced mRNA and protein changes in receptors relevant to lipid-laden foam cell formation and demonstrate the utility of THP-1 macrophages for screening of atherosclerotic risk potentia.
 scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI and splice variant SR-BII) plays a central role in HDL cholesterol metabolism and represents a candidate gene for a number of related diseases. We examined the genetic diversity of its coding and flanking regions in a sample of 178 chromosomes from individuals of European, African, East Asian (including Southeast Asian), Middle-Eastern as well as Amerindian descent. Nine of the 14 polymorphisms observed are new. Four of the five variants causing amino acid replacements, G2S, S229G, R484W, and G499R, are likely to affect protein structure and function. SR-BI/BII diversity is partitioned among 19 haplotypes; all but one interconnected by single mutation or a recombination event. Such tight haplotype network and the unusual geographic partitioning of this diversity, high not only in Africa but in East Asia as well, suggests its recent origin and possible effect of selection. Coalescent analysis infers a relatively short time to the most recent common ancestor and points to population expansion in Africa and East Asia. These two continents differ significantly in pairwise F(ST) values, differing as well from a single cluster formed by Europe, Middle East and America. In the context of findings for similarly analyzed other loci, we propose that a selective sweep at the origin of modern human populations could explain the low level of ancestral SR-BI/II diversity. The unusually deep split between Africa and Asia, well beyond the Upper Paleolithic when inferred under neutrality, is consistent with subsequent geographical and demographic expansion favoring the accumulation of new variants, especially in groups characterized by large effective population sizes, such as Asians and Africans. The relevance of such partitioning of SR-BI/II diversity remains to be investigated in genetic epidemiological studies which can be guided by the present finding.
 receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) mediates selective uptake of high density lipoprotein (HDL) lipids. It is unclear whether this process occurs at the cell membrane or via endocytosis. Our group previously identified an alternative mRNA splicing variant of SR-BI, named SR-BII, with an entirely different, yet highly conserved cytoplasmic C terminus. In this study we aimed to compare HDL uptake by both isoforms. Whereas SR-BI was mainly ( approximately 70%) localized on the surface of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, as determined by biotinylation, HDL binding at 4 degrees C, and studies of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged SR-BI/II fusion proteins, the majority of SR-BII ( approximately 80-90%) was expressed intracellularly. The cellular distribution of SR-BI was not affected by deletion of the C terminus, which suggests that the distinct C terminus of SR-BII is responsible for its intracellular expression. Pulse-chase experiments showed that SR-BII rapidly internalized HDL protein, whereas in the case of SR-BI most HDL protein remained surface bound. Like its ligand, SR-BII was more rapidly endocytosed compared with SR-BI. Despite more rapid HDL uptake by SR-BII than SR-BI, selective cholesteryl ether uptake was significantly lower. Relative to their levels of expression at the cell surface, however, both isoforms mediated selective uptake with similar efficiency. HDL protein that was internalized by SR-BII largely co-localized with transferrin in the endosomal recycling compartment. Within the endosomal recycling compartment of SR-BII cells, there was extensive co-localization of internalized HDL lipid and protein. These results do not support a model that selective lipid uptake by SR-BI requires receptor/ligand recycling within the cell. We conclude that SR-BII may influence cellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis in a manner that is distinct from SR-B.
y has examined the dimeric/oligomeric forms of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and its alternatively spliced form, SR-BII, in a diverse group of cells and tissues: i.e., normal and hormonally altered tissues of mice and rats as well as tissues of transgenic animals and genetically altered steroidogenic and nonsteroidogenic cells overexpressing the SR-B proteins. Using both biochemical and morphological techniques, we have seen that these dimeric and higher order oligomeric forms of SR-BI expression are strongly associated with both functional and morphological expression of the selective HDL cholesteryl ester uptake pathway. Rats and mice show some species differences in expression of SR-BII dimeric forms; this difference does not extend to the use of SR-B cDNA types for transfection purposes. In a separate study, cotransfection of HEK293 cells with cMyc and V5 epitope-tagged SR-BI permitted coprecipitation and quantitative coimmunocytochemical measurements at the electron microscope level, suggesting that much of the newly expressed SR-BI protein in stimulated cells dimerizes and that the SR-BI dimers are localized to the cell surface and specifically to microvillar or double membraned intracellular channels. These combined data suggest that SR-BI self-association represents an integral step in the selective cholesteryl ester uptake proces.
r elucidate the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) in reverse cholesterol transport and in atherogenesis, we performed studies in the rabbit, an animal model displaying a lipoprotein profile similar to that of human, expressing cholesteryl ester transfer protein in plasma and having been demonstrated to be susceptible to atherosclerosis. In this report, we describe for the first time the isolation and characterization of rabbit cDNA fragments encoding SR-BI and scavenger receptor class B type II (SR-BII). Development of an isoform-specific Taqman Real Time PCR system and generation of isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies allowed us to measure SR-BI and SR-BII expression in various rabbit organs on mRNA and protein levels, respectively. We found the highest expression of SR-BI in adrenal gland, liver, and proximal intestine; lesser expression was found in appendix and spleen. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections showed SR-BI expression in the cortex but not in the medulla of adrenal gland. An increasing portal to central vein gradient of expression was found within the hepatic lobule. As shown in this report, identification and characterization of SR-BI expression in the rabbit affords a powerful tool to elucidate the role of SR-BI in cholesterol homeostasis and atherogenesis in huma.
studies in recombinant cells indicate that scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) can promote cholesterol efflux, investigations in transgenic mice overexpressing or deficient in SR-BI endorse its physiological function as selectively sequestering cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Less clear is the role of SR-BII, a splice variant of the SR-B gene that differs only in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Here, we identify several putative signalling motifs in the C-terminus of human SR-BII, which are absent from SR-BI, and hypothesize that these motifs interact with signalling molecules to mobilize stored cholesteryl esters and/or promote the efflux of intracellular free cholesterol. 'Pull-down' assays using a panel of tagged SH3 (Src homology 3) domains showed that cytoplasmic SR-BII, but not cytoplasmic SR-BI, bound the SH3 domain of phospholipase C-gamma1; this interaction was not, however, detected under more physiological conditions. Specific anti-peptide antisera identified SR-BII in human monocyte/macrophage THP-1 cells and, in recombinant cells, revealed receptor localization to caveolae, a plasma membrane microdomain that concentrates signal-transducer molecules and acts as a conduit for cholesterol flux between cells and lipoproteins. Consistent with its caveolar localization, expression of human SR-BII in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-SR-BII) was associated with increased HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Nevertheless, when CHO-SR-BII cells were pre-loaded with cholesteryl [(3)H]oleate and incubated with HDL, cholesteryl ester stores were not reduced compared with control cells. We conclude that although human SR-BII is expressed by macrophages, contains cytoplasmic signalling motifs and localizes to caveolae, its ability to stimulate cholesterol efflux does not reflect enhanced hydrolysis of stored cholesteryl ester.
cell lines serve as a suitable model to study hepatic clearance of lipoprotein-associated cholesteryl esters (CEs). The present study aimed at investigating holoparticle-association of and selective CE-uptake from human high density lipoprotein subclass 3 (HDL3) by non-malignant adult (Chang-liver) and non-malignant fetal (WRL-68) epithelial cell lines as well as a hepatocellular carcinoma (HUH-7) cell line. Binding properties of 125I-HDL3 at 4 and 37 degrees C were similar for all three cell lines while degradation rates were highest for Chang-liver cells. Calculating the selective uptake of HDL3-associated CEs as the difference between [3H]CE- and 125I-HDL3 cell-association revealed that the selective lipid uptake and holoparticle-association was similar in Chang-liver while in WRL-68 and HUH-7 cells pronounced capacity for lipid tracer uptake in excess of holoparticle uptake was measured. Using RT-PCR, Northern and Western blot analysis, as well as immunocytochemical technique pronounced expression of scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) but not SR-BII (a splice variant of SR-BI less efficient for selective CE-uptake than SR-BI) could be identified in HUH-7 and WRL-68 cells. A polyclonal antiserum raised against SR-BI significantly decreased cell-association of [3H]CE-HDL3 in HUH-7 and WRL-68. The present findings suggest that the capacity for selective cholesteryl ester-uptake from high density lipoprotein by malignant and normal epithelial cells from the liver depends on expression of the scavenger receptor class B, type .
choriocarcinoma cells display many of the biochemical and morphological characteristics reported for in utero invasive trophoblast cells we have studied cholesterol supply from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to these cells. Binding properties of 125I-labeled HDL subclass 3 (HDL3) at 4 degrees C were similar for BeWo, JAr, and Jeg3 choriocarcinoma cell lines while degradation rates at 37 degrees C were highest for BeWo. Calculating the selective cholesteryl ester (CE)-uptake as the difference between specific cell association of [3H]CE-labeled HDL3 and holoparticle association of 125I-labeled HDL3 revealed that in BeWo cells, the selective CE-uptake was slightly lower than holoparticle association. However, the pronounced capacity for specific cell association of [3H]CE-HDL3 and selective [3H]CE-uptake in excess of HDL3-holoparticle association, and cAMP-mediated enhanced cell association of [3H]CE-HDL3 in JAr and Jeg3 suggested the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) to be responsible for this pathway. Abundant expression of SR-BI (but not SR-BII, a splice variant of SR-BI) could be observed in JAr and Jeg3 but not in BeWo cells using RT-PCR, Northern and Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemical technique. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SR-BI in all three choriocarcinoma cell lines resulted in an enhanced capacity for cell association of [3H]CE-HDL3 (20-fold in BeWo; fivefold in JAr and Jeg3). The fact that exogenous HDL3 remarkably increases proliferation in JAr and Jeg3 supports the notion that selective CE-uptake and subsequent intracellular generation of cholesterol is coupled to cellular growth. From our findings we propose that JAr and Jeg3 cells serve as a suitable in vitro model to study selective CE-supply to human placental cell.
al pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that underlie the retina ingest and metabolize thousands of lipid-rich photoreceptor outer segments (POS) every day. The scavenger receptor (SR) CD36 and integrin alphavbeta5 have been shown to participate in POS binding and internalization by RPE cells. The objective of the current study was to determine whether RPE cells express SRs other than CD36. Primary cultures of human RPE cells express both mRNA and protein for SR-BI and SR- BII. SR-BI and SR-BII mRNAs were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. SR-BI protein was detected by immune precipitation of [(35)S]methionine-labeled crude cellular extracts. SR-BII was detected by Western blotting of immune precipitated crude cellular extracts. SR-BI and SR-BII proteins were also detected by immunofluorescence staining of RPE cells in culture. The results suggest that these SRs may play a role in POS lipid binding and uptake by RPE cells in the ey.
nt study used the human Caco-2 cell line and mouse intestine to explore the topology of expression of the class B type I scavenger receptor (SR-BI) in intestinal cells. Results showed that intestinal cells expressed only the SR-BI isoform with little or no expression of the SR-BII variant. The expression of SR-BI in Caco-2 cells is differentiation dependent, with little or no expression in preconfluent undifferentiated cells. Analysis of Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell porous membranes revealed the presence of SR-BI on both the apical and basolateral cell surface. Immunoblot analysis of mouse intestinal cell extracts demonstrated a gradation of SR-BI expression along the gastrocolic axis of the intestine, with the highest level of expression in the proximal intestine and decreasing to minimal expression levels in the distal intestine. Immunofluorescence studies with SR-BI-specific antibodies also confirmed this expression pattern. Importantly, the immunofluorescence studies also revealed that SR-BI immunoreactivity was most intense in the apical membrane of the brush border in the duodenum. The crypt cells did not show any reactivity with SR-BI antibodies. The localization of SR-BI in the jejunum was found to be different from that observed in the duodenum. SR-BI was present on both apical and basolateral surfaces of the jejunum villus. Localization of SR-BI in the ileum was also different, with little SR-BI detectable on either apical or basolateral membranes. Taken together, these results suggest that SR-BI has the potential to serve several functions in the intestine. The localization of SR-BI on the apical surface of the proximal intestine is consistent with the hypothesis of its possible role in dietary cholesterol absorption, whereas SR-BI present on the basolateral surface of the distal intestine suggests its possible involvement in intestinal lipoprotein uptak.
 receptors bind and internalize modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Because the expression of scavenger receptors is not down-regulated by cholesterol, macrophages (Mphi) expressing scavenger receptors can internalize substantial quantities of cholesteryl ester from oxidized LDL and HDL, leading to foam cell formation. Mphi express several different classes of the growing scavenger receptor family on their cell surface and their relative contribution to Mphi cholesterol physiology and atherogenesis is the subject of intense investigation. We focus on the potential role of two scavenger receptors, macrosialin and SR-BI/II in Mphi cholesterol metabolism. Macrosialin is a predominantly Mphi-specific oxidized LDL-binding protein and an atherogenic diet markedly up-regulates its hepatic expression in atherosclerosis-susceptible and atherosclerosis-resistant mouse strains. The HDL receptor, SR-BI and its splicing variant SR-BII, colocalize with caveolin in caveolae in Mphi. Caveolae are initial acceptor sites for cholesteryl esters and these findings indicate a possible role for caveolae and SR-BI in Mphi-selective lipid uptake and in regulating Mphi cholesterol flux in the vascular wal.
nger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), binds high density lipoprotein (HDL) and mediates selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from HDL and HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux from cells. We recently identified a new mRNA variant that differs from the previously characterized form in that the encoded C-terminal cytoplasmic domain is almost completely different. In the present study, we demonstrate that the mRNAs for mouse SR-BI and SR-BII (previously termed SR-BI.2) are the alternatively spliced products of a single gene. The translation products predicted from human, bovine, mouse, hamster, and rat cDNAs exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity within the SR-BII C-terminal domain (62-67% identity when compared with the human sequence), suggesting that this variant is biologically important. SR-BII protein represents approximately 12% of the total immunodetectable SR-BI/II protein in mouse liver. Subcellular fractionation of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that SR-BII, like SR-BI, is enriched in caveolae, indicating that the altered cytoplasmic tail does not affect targeting of the receptor. SR-BII mediated both selective cellular uptake of cholesteryl ether from HDL as well as HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux from cells, although with approximately 4-fold lower efficiency than SR-BI. In vivo studies using adenoviral vectors showed that SR-BII was relatively less efficient than SR-BI in reducing plasma HDL cholesterol. These studies show that SR-BII, an HDL receptor isoform containing a distinctly different cytoplasmic tail, mediates selective lipid transfer between HDL and cells, but with a lower efficiency than the previously characterized varian.
 receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) is essential for endosome biogenesis and reorganization and serves as a receptor for both β-glucocerebrosidase and enterovirus 71. However, little is known about its function in innate immune cells. In this study, we show that, among human peripheral blood cells, SCARB2 is most highly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and its expression is further upregulated by CpG oligodeoxynucleotide stimulation. Knockdown of SCARB2 in pDC cell line GEN2.2 dramatically reduces CpG-induced type I IFN production. Detailed studies reveal that SCARB2 localizes in late endosome/lysosome of pDCs, and knockdown of SCARB2 does not affect CpG oligodeoxynucleotide uptake but results in the retention of TLR9 in the endoplasmic reticulum and an impaired nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor 7. The IFN-I production by TLR7 ligand stimulation is also impaired by SCARB2 knockdown. However, SCARB2 is not essential for influenza virus or HSV-induced IFN-I production. These findings suggest that SCARB2 regulates TLR9-dependent IFN-I production of pDCs by mediating endosomal translocation of TLR9 and nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor .
isease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Although it is a monogenic disease, there is vast phenotypic heterogeneity, even among patients with the same genotype. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in many biological processes and diseases. To determine whether miRNAs can affect glucocerebrosidase activity, we performed a screen of 875 different miRNA mimics. The screen was performed using Gaucher fibroblasts, and glucocerebrosidase activity was used as the initial outcome parameter. We found several miRNAs that either up- or down-regulated glucocerebrosidase activity. In follow-up assays, we confirmed that one specific miRNA (miR-127-5p) down-regulated both glucocerebrosidase activity and protein levels by down-regulation of LIMP-2, the receptor involved in proper trafficking of glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. A conditioned media assay demonstrated that cells treated with this miRNA secreted glucocerebrosidase into the extracellular environment, supporting impaired LIMP-2 function. Two other miRNAs, miR-16-5p and miR-195-5p, were found to up-regulate glucocerebrosidase activity by greater than 40% and to enhance expression and protein levels of the enzyme. In conclusion, we show that miRNAs can alter glucocerebrosidase activity in patient cells, indicating that miRNAs can potentially act as modifiers in Gaucher diseas.
omal integral membrane protein type-2 (LIMP-2/SCARB2) has been identified as a receptor for enterovirus 71 uptake and mannose-6-phosphate-independent lysosomal trafficking of the acid hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase. Here we show that LIMP-2 undergoes proteolytic cleavage mediated by lysosomal cysteine proteases. Heterologous expression and in vitro studies suggest that cathepsin-F is mainly responsible for the lysosomal processing of wild-type LIMP-2. Furthermore, examination of purified lysosomes revealed that LIMP-2 undergoes proteolysis in vivo. Mutations in the gene encoding cathepsin-F (CTSF) have recently been associated with type-B-Kufs-disease, an adult form of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis. In this study we show that disease-causing cathepsin-F mutants fail to cleave LIMP-2. Our findings provide evidence that LIMP-2 represents an in vivo substrate of cathepsin-F with relevance for understanding the pathophysiology of type-B-Kufs-diseas.
 within the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GC) result in Gaucher disease and represent a major risk factor for developing Parkinson disease (PD). Loss of GC activity leads to accumulation of its substrate glucosylceramide and α-synuclein. Since lysosomal activity of GC is tightly linked to expression of its trafficking receptor, the lysosomal integral membrane protein type-2 (LIMP-2), we studied α-synuclein metabolism in LIMP-2-deficient mice. These mice showed an α-synuclein dosage-dependent phenotype, including severe neurological impairments and premature death. In LIMP-2-deficient brains a significant reduction in GC activity led to lipid storage, disturbed autophagic/lysosomal function, and α-synuclein accumulation mediating neurotoxicity of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, apoptotic cell death, and inflammation. Heterologous expression of LIMP-2 accelerated clearance of overexpressed α-synuclein, possibly through increasing lysosomal GC activity. In surviving DA neurons of human PD midbrain, LIMP-2 levels were increased, probably to compensate for lysosomal GC deficiency. Therefore, we suggest that manipulating LIMP-2 expression to increase lysosomal GC activity is a promising strategy for the treatment of synucleinopathie.
β-glucosidase (glucocerbrosidase (GCase)) binding sequence to LIMP-2 (lysosomal integral membrane protein 2), the receptor for intracellular GCase trafficking to the lysosome, has been identified. Heterologous expression of deletion constructs, the available GCase crystal structures, and binding and co-localization of identified peptides or mutant GCases were used to identify and characterize a highly conserved 11-amino acid sequence, DSPIIVDITKD, within human GCase. The binding to LIMP-2 is not dependent upon a single amino acid, but the interactions of GCase with LIMP-2 are heavily influenced by Asp(399) and the di-isoleucines, Ile(402) and Ile(403). A single alanine substitution at any of these decreases GCase binding to LIMP-2 and alters its pH-dependent binding as well as diminishing the trafficking of GCase to the lysosome and significantly increasing GCase secretion. Enterovirus 71 also binds to LIMP-2 (also known as SCARB2) on the external surface of the plasma membrane. However, the LIMP-2/SCARB2 binding sequences for enterovirus 71 and GCase are not similar, indicating that LIMP-2/SCARB2 may have multiple or overlapping binding sites with differing specificities. These findings have therapeutic implications for the production of GCase and the distribution of this enzyme that is delivered to various organ.
, mutations of the intrinsic lysosomal protein SCARB2 are associated with myoclonic epilepsy, collapsing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, and tubular proteinuria. Mice with deficiency of Limp-2 (the murine homologue) develop tubular proteinuria but not focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and they have a defect in macrophage function. To further elucidate the role of Limp-2 in immune function, we induced anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) model of crescentic glomerulonephritis in wild-type (WT) and Limp-2(-/-) littermates by intraperitoneal injections of nephrotoxic sheep serum. Renal injury and immune responses were assessed on day 14. Compared with WT, Limp-2(-/-) mice had significantly reduced crescent formation, interstitial inflammation and a trend to reduced tubulointerstitial injury. On day 1 during the heterologous phase of the disease, albuminuria was significantly increased in WT but not in Limp-2(-/-) mice. On day 14, albuminuria and renal function were similar in the two groups. There was, however, a significant reduction in the influx of glomerular macrophages and CD4(+) T cells in Limp-2(-/-) mice. Interleukin (IL)-4 and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced. Despite the reduction in numbers of infiltrating cells, flow cytometry showed no difference in macrophage or T-cell numbers in the peripheral blood from untreated mice. The systemic humoral immune response, determined by glomerular mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition and mouse anti-sheep IgG subclass production, was similar in both groups. These data suggest that absence of Limp-2 reduces inflammation in experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis with decreased macrophage and T-cell infiltration in the kidney. It suggests an important role for Limp-2 in mediating the inflammatory respons.
 require the presence of many specialized proteins to facilitate their roles in cellular maintenance. One such protein that has proven to be an important player in the lysosomal field is lysosomal integral membrane protein-2 (LIMP-2), encoded by the gene SCARB2. LIMP-2 is required for the normal biogenesis and maintenance of lysosomes and endosomes and has been identified as the specific receptor for glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease. Research into LIMP-2 and the SCARB2 gene indicate that it may be a factor contributing to the clinical heterogeneity seen among patients with Gaucher disease. Mutations in SCARB2 have also been identified as the cause of action myoclonus renal failure (AMRF), and in some cases progressive myoclonic epilepsy. A total of 14 disease-causing SCARB2 mutations have been identified to date. The role of LIMP-2 in human pathology has expanded with its identification as a component of the intercalated disk in cardiac muscle and as a receptor for specific enteroviruses, two unanticipated findings that reaffirm the myriad roles of lysosomal proteins. Studies into the full impact of LIMP-2 deficiency and the LIMP2/glucocerebrosidase molecular pathway will lead to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis in Gaucher disease and AMRF, and to new insights into lysosomal processing, trafficking and functio.
 integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2, SCARB2) is directly linked to β-glucocerebrosidase enzyme (βGC) and mediates the transport of this enzyme from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. Active βGC cleaves the β-glycosidic linkages of glucosylceramide, an intermediate in the metabolism of sphingoglycolipids, generating ceramide. In this study we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for LIMP-2 and observed that these cells were more susceptible to infection by extracellular amastigotes of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi when compared to wild-type (WT) fibroblasts. The absence of LIMP-2 decreases the activity of βGC measured in fibroblast extracts. Replacement of βGC enzyme in LIMP-2 deficient fibroblasts restores the infectivity indices to those of WT cells in T. cruzi invasion assays. Considering the participation of βGC in the production of host cell ceramide, we propose that T. cruzi extracellular amastigotes are more invasive to cells deficient in this membrane component. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of host cell lysosomal components in T. cruzi invasio.
cessing and storage is believed to occur in lysosome-like structures in the afferent arteriole. SCARB2/Limp-2 is a transmembrane lysosomal protein responsible for the intracellular trafficking of β-glucocerebrosidase. This study aimed to confirm the expression of SCARB2/Limp-2 in renin secretory granules, and explore its role in renin processing and secretio.
sation studies of (pro)renin with lysosomal membrane proteins, SCARB2/Limp-2, LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, were performed in mouse and human kidney sections. Intrarenal expression and secretion of (pro)renin in wild-type (WT) and Limp-2(-/-) mice were compared with and without stimulatio.
mp-2, LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 co-localised with (pro)- renin in mouse and human kidney. Plasma renin concentration was increased in Limp-2(-/-) mice when compared to WT littermates. No change in (pro)renin expression, however, was observed in Limp-2(-/-) mouse kidney cortex by immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR or the ultrastructural appearance of renin secretory granules. Acute stimulation of renin release by isoprenaline or hydralazine was similar in WT and Limp-2(-/-) mice. Following chronic salt restriction, however, immunofluorescence microscopy showed less (pro)renin expressed in Limp-2(-/-) compared with WT mouse kidneys, and there was significantly less prorenin but not renin by Western blotting in Limp-2(-/-) mouse kidney cortex, despite no difference in circulating renin level.
retory granules possess integral lysosomal proteins, confirming that they are indeed modified lysosomes. Limp-2 deficiency leads to a minor increase in circulating renin. Limp-2, however, is not required for acute or chronic stimulation of renin releas.
enetic risk factors have been identified for Parkinson disease (PD), including mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA1). Recently, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described as SCARB2 SNPs were reported to be associated with PD. SCARB2 is an attractive candidate gene for PD as it encodes for lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2), a protein involved in transporting glucocerebrosidase from the ER to the lysosome. The first SNP, rs6812193, located 64 kb upstream of SCARB2, was identified in a Parkinson disease Genome Wide Association study of Americans with European ancestry (p = 7.6 × 10(-10), OR = 0.84), but was not replicated in a study in the Han Chinese. The second SNP, rs6825004, located within intron 2 of SCARB2 was reported in an association study of Parkinson disease in Greece (p = 0.02, OR = 0.68). We explored whether the two SNPs impact SCARB2 expression or LIMP-2 protein levels, testing fifteen control samples. First, the genotypes for each subject were determined for both SNPs using a Taqman assay. Then, RNA and protein were extracted from the corresponding cell pellets. Neither the relative RNA expression by real-time PCR, nor LIMP-2 levels on Western blots correlated with SNP genotype. Thus, these two reported SNPs may not be related to SCARB2 and demonstrate the challenges in interpreting some association studies. While LIMP-2 could still play a role in PD pathogenesis, this study does not provide evidence that the SNPs identified are in fact related to LIMP-.
ia is associated with the additional loss in the urine of small molecular weight proteins normally degraded by the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), and competition for binding to the megalin/cubilin reuptake system has been considered the likely cause. We have previously reported that deficiency of the intrinsic lysosomal protein Limp-2 causes tubular proteinuria due to reduced fusion of endosomes with lysosomes in the PCT leading to inadequate proteolysis. To determine whether this mechanism also contributes to the tubular proteinuria induced by albumin overload in normal mice, wild-type (WT) mice received daily BSA injections intraperitoneally for 10 days, using untreated Limp-2(-/-) mice as positive controls for inadequate proteolysis. BSA overload induced significant urinary loss of megalin and cubilin ligands in WT mice. Tubular uptake of Alexa-conjugated BSA, administered by intravenous injection, was not reduced in the PCT of mice receiving intraperitoneal BSA. Expression of the tubular protein receptor megalin was also unchanged. There was a delay in proteolysis of reabsorbed proteins in WT mice receiving BSA, evidenced by an increased quantity of retinol-binding protein (RBP) in the kidney cortex, increased basal distribution of endocytosed RBP in cells of the PCT, and persistence of exogenous Alexa-conjugated BSA and RBP after injection. Upregulation of cathepsin L and normal fusion of lysosomes with endosomes were apparently not sufficient to maintain normal clearance of endocytosed proteins. The data suggest that in the presence of competition from albumin overload, reabsorption of filtered proteins is limited by the capacity of lysosomal degradation rather than receptor-mediated endocytosi.
ase renin is the key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that regulates extracellular volume and blood pressure. Renin is synthesized in renal juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells) as the inactive precursor prorenin. Activation of prorenin by cleavage of the prosegment occurs in renin storage vesicles that have lysosomal properties. To characterize the renin storage vesicles more precisely, the expression and functional relevance of the major lysosomal membrane proteins lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1), LAMP-2, and lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2) were determined in JG cells. Immunostaining experiments revealed strong coexpression of renin with the LIMP-2 (SCARB2), while faint staining of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 was detected in some JG cells only. Stimulation of the renin system (ACE inhibitor, renal hypoperfusion) resulted in the recruitment of renin-producing cells in the afferent arterioles and parallel upregulation of LIMP-2, but not LAMP-1 or LAMP-2. Despite the coregulation of renin and LIMP-2, LIMP-2-deficient mice had normal renal renin mRNA levels, renal renin and prorenin contents, and plasma renin and prorenin concentrations under control conditions and in response to stimulation with a low salt diet (with or without angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition). No differences in the size or number of renin vesicles were detected using electron microscopy. Acute stimulation of renin release by isoproterenol exerted similar responses in both genotypes in vivo and in isolated perfused kidneys. Renin and the major lysosomal protein LIMP-2 are colocalized and coregulated in renal JG cells, further corroborating the lysosomal nature of renin storage vesicles. LIMP-2 does not appear to play an obvious role in the regulation of renin synthesis or releas.
 hydrolases have long been known to be responsible for the degradation of different substrates in the cell. These acid hydrolases are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transported through the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). From there, they are delivered to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, where they finally become active due to the acidic pH characteristic of the lysosomal compartment. The majority of the enzymes leave the TGN after modification with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues, which are specifically recognized by M6P receptors (MPRs), ensuring their transport to the endosomal/lysosomal system. Although M6P receptors play a major role in the intracellular transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes in mammalian cells, several lines of evidence suggest the existence of alternative processes of lysosomal targeting. Among them, the two that are mediated by the M6P alternative receptors, lysosomal integral membrane protein (LIMP-2) and sortilin, have gained unequivocal support. LIMP-2 was shown to be implicated in the delivery of beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) to the lysosomes, whereas sortilin has been suggested to be a multifunctional receptor capable of binding several different ligands, including neurotensin and receptor-associated protein (RAP), and of targeting several proteins to the lysosome, including sphingolipid activator proteins (prosaposin and GM2 activator protein), acid sphingomyelinase and cathepsins D and H. Here, we review the current knowledge on these two proteins: their discovery, study, structural features and cellular function, with special attention to their role as alternative receptors to lysosomal trafficking. Recent studies associating both LIMP2 and sortilin to disease are also extensively reviewe.
omal membrane protein type 2 is a novel identified lysosomal sorting receptor for β-glucocerebrosidase (GC). Mutations in both genes underlie human pathologies causing action myoclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF) and Gaucher disease (GD), respectively. We now demonstrate that the lumenal acidification mediated by the vacuolar (H(+) )-ATPase triggers the dissociation of LIMP-2 and GC in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Moreover, we identified a single histidine residue in LIMP-2 that is necessary for LIMP-2 and GC binding. This residue is in close proximity to a proposed coiled-coil domain, which determines the binding to GC and may function as a critical pH senso.
 integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2) is responsible for proper sorting and lysosomal targeting of glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease (GD). Mutations in the gene for LIMP-2, SCARB2, are implicated in inherited forms of myoclonic epilepsy, and myoclonic epilepsy is part of the phenotypic spectrum associated with GD. We investigated whether SCARB2 mutations impact the Gaucher phenotype focusing on patients with myoclonic epilepsy, including a pair of siblings with GD who were discordant for myoclonic seizures. Sequencing of SCARB2 genomic and cDNA identified a heterozygous, maternally inherited novel mutation, c.1412A&gt;G (p.Glu471Gly), in the brother with GD and myoclonic epilepsy, absent from his sibling and controls. Glucocerebrosidase activity, Western blots, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated markedly decreased LIMP-2 and glucocerebrosidase in cells from the sibling with (p.Glu471Gly) LIMP-2, and diminished glucocerebrosidase in lysosomes. The cells secreted highly glycosylated enzyme and showed mistrafficking of glucocerebrosidase. Sequencing of SCARB2 in 13 other subjects with GD and myoclonic epilepsy and 40 controls failed to identify additional mutations. The study provides further evidence for the association of LIMP-2 and myoclonic epilepsy, explains the drastically different phenotypes encountered in the siblings, and demonstrates that LIMP-2 can serve as a modifier in G.
oclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF) is considered a rare form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) associated with renal failure. A mutation on the gene encoding the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2-LIMP-2 (SCARB2), the receptor responsible for targeting glucocerebrosidase to the lysosomes, was recently described, allowing a better understanding of its etiopathogenesis. We describe clinically two sisters with AMRF that resulted from a mutation in the SCARB2 gene. The renal involvement was due to nephropathy C1q. When substrate-reduction therapy, to correct the possible glucocerebroside storage in the cells with glucocerebrosidase deficiency, was administered to one of the siblings, a significant improvement was observed. This report points out a rational for a therapeutical approach to this new lysossomopath.
y of the intrinsic lysosomal protein human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2; Limp-2 in mice) causes collapsing focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) and myoclonic epilepsy in humans, but patients with no apparent kidney damage have recently been described. We now demonstrate that these patients can develop tubular proteinuria. To determine the mechanism, mice deficient in Limp-2, the murine homolog of SCARB2, were studied. Most low-molecular-weight proteins filtered by the glomerulus are removed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) by megalin/cubilin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis. Expression of megalin and cubilin was unchanged in Limp-2(-/-) mice, however, and the initial uptake of injected Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated bovine serum albumin (Alexa-BSA) was similar to wild-type mice, indicating that megalin/cubilin-dependent, receptor-mediated endocytosis was unaffected. There was a defect in proteolysis of reabsorbed proteins in the Limp-2(-/-) mice, demonstrated by the persistence of Alexa-BSA in the PCT compared with controls. This was associated with the failure of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B to colocalize with Alexa-BSA and endogenous retinol-binding protein in kidneys from Limp-2(-/-) mice. The data suggest that tubular proteinuria in Limp-2(-/-) mice is due to failure of endosomes containing reabsorbed proteins to fuse with lysosomes in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Failure of proteolysis is a novel mechanism for tubular proteinuri.
e immune response to Listeria monocytogenes depends on phagosomal bacterial degradation by macrophages. Here, we describe the role of LIMP-2, a lysosomal type III transmembrane glycoprotein and scavenger-like protein, in Listeria phagocytosis. LIMP-2-deficient mice display a macrophage-related defect in Listeria innate immunity. They produce less acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 but normal levels of IL-12, IL-10, and IFN-γ and a 25-fold increase in susceptibility to Listeria infection. This macrophage defect results in a low listericidal potential, poor response to TNF-α activation signals, impaired phago-lysosome transformation into antigen-processing compartments, and uncontrolled LM cytosolic growth that fails to induce normal levels of acute phase pro-inflammatory cytokines. LIMP-2 transfection of CHO cells confirmed that LIMP-2 participates in the degradation of Listeria within phagosomes, controls the late endosomal/lysosomal fusion machinery, and is linked to the activation of Rab5a. Therefore, the role of LIMP-2 appears to be connected to the TNF-α-dependent and early activation of Listeria macrophages through internal signals linking the regulation of late trafficking events with the onset of the innate Listeria immune respons.
oclonus-renal failure syndrome (AMRF) is caused by mutations in the lysosomal integral membrane protein type 2 (LIMP-2/SCARB2). LIMP-2 was identified as a sorting receptor for beta-glucocerebrosidase (beta-GC), which is defective in Gaucher disease. To date, six AMRF-causing mutations have been described, including splice site, missense and nonsense mutations. All mutations investigated in this study lead to a retention of LIMP-2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but affect the binding to beta-GC differentially. From the three nonsense mutations, only the Q288X mutation was still able to bind to beta-GC as efficiently as compared with wild-type LIMP-2, whereas the W146SfsX16 and W178X mutations lost their beta-GC-binding capacity almost completely. The LIMP-2 segment 145-288, comprising the nonsense mutations, contains a highly conserved coiled-coil domain, which we suggest determines beta-GC binding. In fact, disruption of the helical arrangement and amphiphatic nature of the coiled-coil domain abolishes beta-GC binding, and a synthetic peptide comprising the coiled-coil domain of LIMP-2 displays pH-selective multimerization properties. In contrast to the reduced binding properties of the nonsense mutations, the only missense mutation (H363N) found in AMRF leads to increased binding of beta-GC to LIMP-2, indicating that this highly conserved histidine modifies the affinity of LIMP-2 to its ligand. With the present study, we demonstrate that disruption of the coiled-coil structure or AMRF disease-causing mutations abolish beta-GC binding, indicating the importance of an intact coiled-coil structure for the interaction of LIMP-2 and beta-G.
ate contains extremely high concentrations of zinc, but survives and grows without apparent injury. This begs the question as to how prostate cells avoid the toxic effects of zinc. In a previous study, the authors found that; HIF-1alpha is expressed concomitantly with the accumulation of zinc in the epithelial cells of normal rat prostates, the zinc ion stabilizes HIF-1alpha in prostate cells, and that HIF-1alpha protects prostate cells from zinc toxicity. In the present study, the authors addressed the mechanism responsible for the protective effect of HIF-1alpha in a high zinc environmen.

was induced by ZnCl(2) in a HIF-1 dependent manner in both DU-145 and PNT2 prostate cells. Furthermore, HIF-1 induced survivin expression at the transcriptional level and the induction of survivin was abolished by HIF-1alpha knock-down. In addition, HIF-1-dependent survivin overexpression promoted prostrate cell survival and prevented cell arrest in the presence of high zinc concentrations, and si-survivin transfected cells under zinc rich conditions contained markedly higher levels of cleaved caspase-9 and PARP than si-con transfected cells. Finally, survivin expression patterns well matched rat prostate proliferation statuse.
c rich conditions, prostate epithelial cells HIF-1-dependently express survivin, which promotes prostate cell proliferation, and prevents apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Accordingly, the HIF-1alpha-survivin pathway appears to facilitate prostate cell survival and growth in zinc rich environments, and this pathway could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate hyperplasi.
actor IX cDNA clone isolated from a liver cDNA library constructed in phage lambda gt11 vector was shown to express factor IX protein in Escherichia coli. A factor IX immunospecific protein of 46.8 kDa was expressed, but was not a beta-galactosidase-factor IX fusion protein. Expression was seen when the factor IX cDNA was cloned into two different vector systems, lambda gt11 and pUC9, in both orientations with respect to the vector lacZ promoter. The expression of factor IX was not under control of the lacZ promoter of either vector system. In addition, when the factor IX cDNA fragment was subcloned in both orientations into a promoterless cloning vector (p CPP3), the factor IX cDNA fragment demonstrated promoter activity when inserted in only one orientation resulting in expression of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. A DNA computer search of the N-terminal sequences of the factor IX gene revealed prokaryotic-like promoter and ribosome-binding site (RBS) sequences with strong homology to the E. coli consensus sequences. The predicted sites homologous with prokaryotic promoter and RBS consensus sequences are followed by an in-frame methionine which could correspond to the translation start codon of the expressed factor IX. This report provides the first evidence that a eukaryotic gene encodes the information necessary for both transcription and translation to control gene expression in a prokaryotic hos.
y antibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) or IX (FIX) are important issues when managing patients with hemophilia A or B. Advances in bypassing agents such as recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (APCC) have enabled the aggressive management of hemophilia with inhibitors during emergency or elective surgery. This study provides an updated evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of bypassing agents in treating perioperative bleedin.
ed the records of hemophilia patients with inhibitors who underwent surgery between May 2008 and July 2014 using bypassing agents or high-dose FVIII concentrates at a single cente.
 36 surgeries (24 orthopedic, 12 other) were conducted in 18 hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The median inhibitor titer at surgery was 14 (range, 0.7-1,900) Bethesda units. Most patients had high-responding inhibitors. In total, 25 patients received APCC, 9 with rFVIIa initially. In most cases, bleeding stopped or was well controlled; however, bleeding in 6 patients was controlled using sequential bypassing therapy. Hemostatic efficacy of bypassing agents in various surgeries, based on the final patient outcome, was 94.4% (34/36). Among 5 emergency surgeries, 2 deaths occurre.
rol of hemostasis can be achieved using bypassing agents in hemophilia patients with inhibitors who are undergoing surgery. Thorough planning is needed before elective surgery and more active and aggressive management may be needed for emergency surgery. Use of bypassing agents can facilitate safe and successful surgeries in hemophilia patients with inhibitor.
evelopments in haemophilia therapy are directed at two therapeutic targets: reduction of injection frequency and reduction or bypassing of inhibitors. A variety of new molecules addressing these aims are now completing clinical trials and are ready to enter clinical use. First amongst these are modified Factor VIII (FVIII) and Factor IX (FIX) molecules with extended half-lives. FIX modifications have achieved 5-fold prolongation of half-life whilst effects on FVIII have been more modest, at less than two-fold. We now face the problem of integrating these into clinical practice. Other approaches have generated chemically modified FVIII molecules with altered activation profiles. An alternative way of correcting the haemophilia defect is to reduce the activity of natural anticoagulants in an attempt to restore the balance of haemostasis. These methods are also giving promising results but, as with all new approaches, it will be some while before they all find their place in practic.
e the conditions of synovial derived mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) differentiating into the fibrocartilage cells by using the orthogonal experimen.
ium was harvested from 5 adult New Zealand white rabbits, and SMSCs were separated by adherence method. The flow cytometry and multi-directional differentiation method were used to identify the SMSCs. The conditions were found from the preliminary experiment and literature review. The missing test was carried out to screen the conditions and then 12 conditions were used for the orthogonal experiment, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2), dexamethasone (DEX), proline, ascorbic acid (ASA), pyruvic acid, insulin + transferrin + selenious acid pre-mixed solution (ITS), bovin serum albumin (BSA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), intermittent hydraulic pressure (IHP), bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP-7), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). The L60 (212) orthogonal experiment was designed using the SPSS 18.0 with 2 level conditions and the cells were induced to differentiate on the small intestinal submucosa (SIS)-3D scaffold. The CD151+/CD44+ cells were detected with the flow cytometry and then the differentiation rate was recorded. The immumohistochemical staining, cellular morphology, toluidine blue staining, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR examination for the gene expressions of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 gene (Sox9), aggrecan gene (AGN), collagen type I gene (Col I), collagen type II gene (Col II), collagen type IX gene (Col IX) were used for result confirmation. The differentiation rate was calculated as the product of CD151/CD44+ cells and cells with Col I high expression. The grow curve was detected with the DNA abundance using the PicoGreen Assay. The visual observation and the variances analysis among the variable were used to evaluate the result of the orthogonal experiment, 1 level interaction was considered. The q-test and the least significant difference (LDS) were used for the variance analysis with a type III calibration model. The test criteria (a) was 0.0.
 were certified as SMSCs, the double-time of the cells was 28 hours. During the differentiation into the fibrocartilage, the volume of the SIS-3D scaffold enlarged double every 5 days. The scaffolds were positively stained by toluidine blue at 14 days. The visual observation showed that high levels of TGF-β1 and BMP-7 were optimum for the differentiation, and BMP-7 showed the interaction with BMP-2. The conditions of DEX, ASA, ITS, transferrin, bFGF showed decreasing promotional function by degrees, and the model showed the perfect relevance. P value was 0.000 according to the variance analysis. The intercept analysis showed different independent variables brought about variant contribution; the TGF-β1, ASA, bFGF, IGF, and BMP-7 were more remarkable, which were similar to the visual observatio.
ocess of the SMSCs differentiation into the fibrocartilage, the concentrations of TGF-β1, ASA, bFGF, and IGF reasonably can improve the conversion rate of the fibrocartilage cells. The accurate conditions of the reaulatory factor should be explored furthe.
herapy for the X-linked coagulation disorder hemophilia is based on intravenous infusion of the specifically deficient coagulation factor. However, 20-30% of hemophilia A patients (factor VIII, FVIII, deficiency) generate inhibitory antibodies against FVIII. While formation of inhibitors directed against factor IX, FIX, resulting from hemophilia B treatment is comparatively rare, a serious complication that is often associated with additional immunotoxicities, e.g. anaphylaxis, occurs. Current immune tolerance protocols to eradiate inhibitors are lengthy, expensive, not effective in all patients, and there are no prophylactic tolerance regimens to prevent inhibitor formation. The outcomes of recent experiments in animal models of hemophilia demonstrate that regulatory CD4(+) T cells (Treg) are of paramount importance in controlling B cell responses to FVIII and FIX. This article reviews several novel strategies designed to in vivo induce coagulation factor-specific Treg cells and discusses the subsets of Treg that may promote immune tolerance in hemophilia. Among others, drug- and gene transfer-based protocols, lymphocyte transplant, and oral tolerance are reviewe.
 polyphosphate (polyP) is a physiological energy-rich polymer with multiple phosphoric anhydride bonds. In cells, like bone forming osteoblasts, glycolysis is the main pathway generating metabolic energy in the form of ATP. Here we show that under hypoxic culture conditions the growth/viability of osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells is not impaired. Addition of polyP to those cells, administered as amorphous calcium polyP nanoparticles (aCa-polyP-NP; size ≈100 nm), significantly increased the proliferation of the cells. In the presence of polyP, the cells produce significant levels of lactate, the end product of anaerobic glycolysis. Under those conditions an 8-fold increase in the steady-state-level of the membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX is found, and a 6-fold induction of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1/2). Then biomineral formation onto the SaOS-2 cells decreases under low oxygen tension. If the polyP nanoparticles are added to the cells the degree of mineralization is enhanced. These changes had been measured also in human mesenchymal stem cells. The assumption that the bicarbonate, generated by the CA in the presence of polyP under low oxygen, is deposited as a constituent of the bioseeds formed during initial HA formation is corroborated by the identification of carbon besides of calcium, oxygen and phosphorus in the initial biomineral deposit onto the cells using a sensitive high-resolution EDS mapping technology. Based on these data we conclude that polyP is required for the supply of metabolic energy during bone mineral formation under physiological, hypoxic conditions, acting as a &quot;metabolic fuel&quot; for the cells to grow.

ted 374 consecutive patients from May 2013 to April 2014 who underwent major cardiac surgery. Each patient had an interview and a neurological clinical examination during the rehabilitation period. Patients with possible peripheral nervous system (PNS) complications underwent further electrodiagnostic tests. Among 374 patients undergoing major heart surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, valvular heart surgery, ascending aortic aneurysm repair) 23 (6.1&nbsp;%) developed 34 new PNS complications. We found four brachial plexopathies; four carpal tunnel syndromes; five critical illness neuropathies; three worsening of pre-existing neuropathies; two involvement of X, one of IX and one of XII cranial nerves; three peroneal (at knee), one saphenous, two median (at Struthers ligament), six ulnar (at elbow) mononeuropathies; two meralgia parestheticas. Diabetes is a strong risk factor for PNS complications (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002); we could not find any other relationship of PNS complications with clinical conditions, demographic data (gender, age) or type of surgical intervention. The mononeuropathies of right arms can be related to ipsilateral vein cannulation; position of body and stretching from chest wall retraction may be the cause of mononeuropathies of left arms (more frequent); the use of saphenous vein and position of the limbs may be the cause of mononeuropathies of the legs; surgical and anesthetical procedures can injure cranial nerves; respiratory failure and infection during the first days after surgery can cause critical illness neuropathies. Careful preoperative assessment and intraoperative management may reduce the risk of long-term PNS complications after cardiac surger.

 1000 hemophilic male patients are registered in Hungary, from which only a trace number suffers from factor IX inhibitory hemophilia. For correct dental and oral surgical treatment of these patients mandatory cooperation is required among medical specialties, exerting multi-staged haemostatic principles. Authors represent in this case report the dental and oral surgical treatment of a B hemophilic patient with high inhibitor level and describe possible local haemostatic measure.
ia is caused by deficiency in coagulation factor VIII or IX. Treatment with the missing coagulation factors has been available in most developed countries for several decades. The aim was to explore the experiences of adults living with severe or moderate haemophilia and their coping strategies at a single centre in Swede.
view study had a qualitative empirical approach and was analyzed on the basis of the method empirical phenomenological psychology. The sample included 14 participants, mean age 42 (19-80 y), who met the inclusion criteria and to saturation of informatio.
haracteristics were; All were satisfied with and grateful for access to medication. An acceptance of the disorder and willingness to live a normal life was identified among all participants. They were all content with the care provided by Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC) and felt supported by its multidisciplinary team. Four typologies were identified; Protective adults and assertive children during up-bringing, finding a role in social context, symptoms and treatments, fear of limited resources in the future. Task-, emotional- and avoidance coping strategies were seen in the interviews. The most prominent coping strategy was task oriente.
rview study with Swedish PWH shows that they strive for normality and adaptation in social activities throughout life finding their own niche. The PWH expressed the importance of knowledge and support from the comprehensive medical team at HTC and therefore it seems important to continue comprehensive medical care at HTC in order to follow-up the haemophilia persons regularl.
tion-associated renal cell carcinoma (t-RCC) is a relatively uncommon subtype of renal cell carcinoma characterized by recurrent gene rearrangements involving the TFE3 or TFEB loci. TFE3 and TFEB are members of the microphthalmia transcription factor (MiT) family, which regulates differentiation in melanocytes and osteoclasts, and MiT family gene fusions activate unique molecular programs that can be detected immunohistochemically. Although the overall clinical behavior of t-RCC is variable, emerging molecular data suggest the possibility of targeted approaches to advanced disease. Thus, distinguishing t-RCC from its morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular mimics may have important clinical implications. The differential diagnosis for t-RCC includes a variety of common renal neoplasms, particularly those demonstrating clear cell and papillary features; in addition, because of immunophenotypic overlap and/or shared molecular abnormalities (ie, TFE3 gene rearrangement), a distinctive set of nonepithelial renal tumors may also warrant consideration. Directed ancillary testing is an essential aspect to the workup of t-RCC cases and may include a panel of immunohistochemical stains, such as PAX8, pancytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, carbonic anhydrase IX, HMB-45, and Melan-A. Dual-color, break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization for TFE3 or TFEB gene rearrangement may be helpful in diagnostically challenging cases or when molecular confirmation is neede.
c events (TEs) are serious adverse events that can occur following administration of clotting factors (CFs.
te occurrence of same-day TEs for different CF products and potential risk factor.
ective cohort study of individuals exposed to CF products during 2008-2013 was conducted using large commercial insurance database. CF products were identified by procedure codes, and TEs were ascertained via diagnosis codes. Crude same-day TE rates (per 1,000 persons exposed) were estimated overall and by congenital factor deficiency (CFD) status, CF products, age, and gender. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to control for confounding. Laboratory analysis was used to compare procoagulant activities of FIX product.
individuals exposed to CFs, 117 (30.8 per 1,000) had same-day TEs recorded. Crude same-day TE rate was higher for CF users without CFD, 70.2 (102 of 1,452), as compared to those with CFD, 6.4 (15 of 2,349), RR=11.0, 95% CI 6.4-18.9. For individuals without CFD, significantly increased same-day TE risk was identified for Factor IX Complex (OR=6.92, 95% CI=3.11-15.40), Factor VIIa (OR=9.42, 95% CI=4.99-17.78), and other products when compared to fibrin sealant. Increased TE risk was found with older age (≥45 years), history of TEs, and underlying health conditions. Laboratory identified elevated procoagulant activity in Profilnine(®) and Benefix(®).
ws increased same-day TE risk for CF users without CFD and suggests substantial off-label CF use. Study findings also show elevated same-day TE rates for different CF products and suggest importance of product properties and patient factors. This article is protected by copyright.

fy tissue biomarkers that are predictive of the therapeutic effect of sunitinib in treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mCRCC.
 included 39 patients with mCRCC treated with sunitinib. Patients were stratified into two groups based on their response to sunitinib treatment: non-responders (progression), and responders (stable disease, regression). The effect of treatment was measured by comparing imaging studies before the initiation treatment with those performed at between 3rd and 7th months of treatment, depending on the patient. Histological samples of tumor tissue and healthy renal parenchyma, acquired during surgery of the primary tumor, were examined with immunohistochemistry to detect tissue targets involved in the signaling pathways of tumor growth and neoangiogenesis. We selected mammalian target of rapamycine, p53, vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 and carbonic anhydrase IX. We compared the average levels of biomarker expression in both, tumor tissue, as well as in healthy renal parenchyma. Results were evaluated using the Student's t-tes.
nders, statistically significant differences in marker expression in tumor tissue versus healthy parenchyma were found for mTOR (4%/16.7%; p=0.01031), p53 (4%/12.7%; p=0.042019), VEGF (62.7%/45%; p=0.019836) and CAIX (45%/15.33%; p=0.001624). A further significant difference was found in the frequency of high expression (more than 60%) between tumor tissue and healthy parenchyma in VEGF (65%/35%; p=0.026487) and CAIX (42%/8%; p=0.003328). CAIX was expressed at high levels in the tumor tissue in both evaluated group.
cantly higher expression of VEGF in CRCC in comparison to healthy parenchyma can predict a better response to sunitini.
-angiogenesis is regulated, in part, by the hypoxia-inducible gene HIF1. Evidence suggests HIF1 associates with polymerized microtubules and traffics to the nucleus. This study investigated the role of HIF1 in mediating the antitumor activity of two steroid-based sulfamate ester microtubule disruptors, STX140 and STX243, in vitro and in vivo. The effects of STX140, STX243 and the parental compound 2-methoxyestradiol (STX66) on HIF1α and HIF2α protein expression were assessed in vitro in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxia. More pertinently, their effects were examined on HIF1-regulated genes in vivo in mice bearing MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 tumors. The level of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (GLUTI), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) was quantified by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Despite inhibiting nuclear HIF1α protein accumulation under hypoxia in vitro, STX140 and STX243 did not significantly regulate the expression of four out of five HIF1α-regulated genes in vitro and in vivo. Only CAIX mRNA expression was down-regulated both in vitro and in vivo. Immunoblot analysis showed that STX140 and STX243 reduced CAIX protein expression in vitro. These compounds had no effect on HIF2α translocation. The potential for inhibition of CAIX by STX140 and STX243 was examined by docking the ligands to the active site in comparison with a known sulfamate-based inhibitor. Microtubule disruption and antitumor activity of STX140 and STX243 is most likely HIF1-independent and may, at least in part, be mediated by inhibition of CAIX expression and activit.
ed the prognostic ability of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and various biological marker expressions to predict recurrence in patients with surgically resected cervical cance.
ective review identified 60 patients with cervical cancer who received [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) at the time of the diagnosis of cancer. The SUVmax, expressions of carbonic anhydrase-IX (CA-IX), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and known prognostic factors were investigate.
n follow-up time was 22.2 months (range 3.4-43.1 months). Using univariate analyses, the stage (stage II, p = 0.0066), SUVmax (&gt; 6, p = 0.027), parametrial involvement (p &lt; 0.0001), and positivity for CA-IX (p = 0.0191) were associated with recurrences of cervical cancer. With the Cox proportional hazard regression model, the SUVmax was a potent predictor for disease-free survival (DFS.
CA-IX expression was related to DFS in the current study, the potent predictor for DFS was SUVmax. Therefore, SUVmax is of greater prognostic value than biological marker expression in patients with surgically resected cervical cance.
 is a serious disease of the respiratory system and is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Heme oxygenase-1&nbsp;(HO-1), a rate-limiting enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis, exerts potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti&#8209;proliferative effects in various diseases. In the present study, we examined the effects of HO-1 on smoke&#8209;induced emphysema, as well as the underlying mechanisms in a rat model of smoke-induced emphysema. Rats were either exposed to cigarette smoke or sham&#8209;exposed for 20&nbsp;weeks to establish the model of smoke-induced emphysema. The rats were subcutaneously injected with protoporphyrin&nbsp;IX [tin-protoporphyrin&nbsp;IX (SnPP) or ferriprotoporphyrin&nbsp;IX chloride (hemin)] during this period to examine the protective effects of HO-1. Subsequently, the development of emphysema, inflammatory cells, the levels of inflammatory mediators, particularly interleukin&nbsp;(IL)-17, tumor necrosis factor&nbsp;(TNF)&#8209;α, monocyte chemotactic protein&#8209;1&nbsp;[MCP&#8209;1, also known as chemokine&nbsp;(C-C&nbsp;motif) ligand&nbsp;2&nbsp;(CCL2)], IL-8&nbsp;[also known as chemokine&nbsp;(C-X-C&nbsp;motif) ligand&nbsp;8&nbsp;(CXCL8)], macrophage inflammatory protein&#8209;2α&nbsp;[MIP-2α, also known as chemokine&nbsp;(C-X-C&nbsp;motif) ligand&nbsp;2&nbsp;(CXCL2)] and IL-10, as well as the malondialdehyde&nbsp;(MDA), superoxide dismutase&nbsp;(SOD) and glutathione&nbsp;(GSH) content were determined. Exposure to smoke increased the total cell, neutrophil and macrophage counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid&nbsp;(BALF). It also increased the levels of the inflammatory mediators, IL-17, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-8 and MIP-2α, as well as the MDA content and induced emphysema. Treatment with hemin upregulated HO-1 expression and attenuated the development of smoke-induced emphysema by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, decreasing the levels of inflammatory mediators and attenuating oxidative damage, to a certain extent. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that HO-1 exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, thus attenuating the development of smoke-induced emphysem.
a B (HB) is an inherited deficiency in coagulation factor IX (FIX) that leads to prolonged bleeding after injury. Although hepatocyte transplantation has been demonstrated to be an effective therapeutic strategy for HB, the quality and sources of hepatocytes still limit their application. Recently, stem cells were proposed as an alternative source of donor cells for cell-based therapy. Much research has been devoted to the properties of stem cells that can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes, thereby providing a new cell source for cell-based therapy. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells represent a renewable source of hepatocytes for cell-based therapy; these cells exhibit pluripotency and differentiation ability and can be derived from somatic cells. These iPS cells are highly similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells. We hypothesized that hepatocyte-like cells derived from iPS cells would have therapeutic efficiency in a mouse model of HB. To test this hypothesis, we differentiated iPS cells toward hepatocytes by stepwise protocol and then transplanted these cells into HB mice. We found that these cells shared many characteristics with hepatocytes, such as albumin synthesis, metabolic capacity, glycogen storage, and ureagenesis. Moreover, iPS-derived hepatocyte transplantation led to increased coagulation factor IX activity, improved thrombus generation, and better hemostasis parameters, and the transferred cells were localized in the liver in recipient HB mice. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that hepatocyte-like cells derived from iPS cells represent a potential cell source for cell-based therapy in the treatment of H.
e is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F that has recently been noted to attenuate hepatic and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries in rodents. To investigate whether triptolide could protect against myocardial I/R injuries, triptolide (25, 50 or 100&nbsp;μg/kg) was administrated in Wistar rats that underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in this study. Our data showed that triptolide pretreatment could attenuate myocardial infarction, increase the fractional shortening and left ventricular systolic pressure and decrease the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in ischemic rats. Also, triptolide was noted to inhibit the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in I/R rats. Moreover, triptolide administration suppressed macrophage infiltration, inhibited the overproduction of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and malondialdehyde (MDA) in reperfused myocardium tissues and upregulated the activities of antioxidative superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). In addition, nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the activity of its downstream target Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ischemic myocardium tissues were enhanced by triptolide pretreatment. In addition, the HO-1 inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin-IX, abrograted the cardiac protection mediated by triptolide. Our study reveals a novel cardioprotective effect of triptolide in rats with I/R injuries, wherein the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling was involve.
low animal cell density of bioreactors and their ability to post-translationally process recombinant factor IX (rFIX) limit hemophilia B therapy to &lt;20% of the world's population. We used transgenic pigs to make rFIX in milk at about 3,000-fold higher output than provided by industrial bioreactors. However, this resulted in incomplete γ-carboxylation and propeptide cleavage where both processes are transmembrane mediated. We then bioengineered the co-expression of truncated, soluble human furin (rFurin) with pro-rFIX at a favorable enzyme to substrate ratio. This resulted in the complete conversion of pro-rFIX to rFIX while yielding a normal lactation. Importantly, these high levels of propeptide processing by soluble rFurin did not preempt γ-carboxylation in the ER and therefore was compartmentalized to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) and also to milk. The Golgi specific engineering demonstrated here segues the ER targeted enhancement of γ-carboxylation needed to biomanufacture coagulation proteins like rFIX using transgenic livestoc.
's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) accompanied by increased oxidative damage. Astrocytes, which are the most abundant glial cell types in the brain, possess higher antioxidant potential partially due to preferentially activated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 genes. Heme oxygenase isoform 1 (HO-1) is crucial for the response to oxidative stress via the catabolism of heme to carbon monoxide, bilirubin, and iron. In the present study, we aimed to investigate astroglial expression of HO-1 in the SNpc, especially in the striatum of a subacute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mouse model of PD, and to investigate the neuroprotective effects of intraventricularly administrated HO-1 activator cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX). The results showed that HO-1 was faintly distributed in neurons but not astrocytes in the normal SNpc and striatum. MPTP triggered a robust HO-1 response in the astrocytes of the striatum after 1-day treatment, but the HO-1 levels declined dramatically at day 3 and were completely undetectable at day 5. Intraventricular administration of CoPPIX for 8&nbsp;days could preferentially activate HO-1 in astrocytes in the striatum but not SNpc. The content of striatal dopamine and its derivatives was restored in the subacute MPTP models. CoPPIX also increased the number of dopaminergic neurons and the tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the SNpc. These results suggest that inadequate HO-1 in striatal astrocytes might contribute to the limited antioxidant defense and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in PD, and preferential HO-1 activation in striatal astrocytes might be neuroprotective. The study thus sheds light on the targeting of HO-1 in striatal astrocytes for PD therapeutic.
a is an X-linked recessive deficiency of clotting factor VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B) that can result in hemarthrosis of various joints, including the elbow. Left unchecked, this can lead to progressive joint destruction and significant morbidity. Appropriate management of the elbow joint through prophylactic measures, accurate imaging, and timely intervention is essential. Replacing or supplementing deficient factor with a plasma-derived or recombinant factor concentrate can minimize bleeding episodes. Joints should be routinely monitored for damage. Plain films offer an inexpensive window into bone disease and joint space changes but lack soft tissue detail and may not detect early changes. Magnetic resonance imaging provides a high level of detail but may be limited by its cost and need for sedation in younger patients. Ultrasound may not achieve the same level of resolution as magnetic resonance imaging, but it is increasingly used as a convenient, effective, and relatively inexpensive alternative. Patients who experience hemarthrosis of the elbow with joint damage often require more invasive treatment. Radiosynovectomy and arthroscopic synovectomy are effective at minimizing pain and preventing future bleeding episodes, whereas extensive joint damage may necessitate total elbow replacemen.
ula (Hb) can play an important role in major depressive disorder (MDD) as it is a key node between fronto-limbic areas and midbrain monoaminergic structures. In vivo neuroimaging studies have shown reductions in Hb volume in a post-mortem sample of patients with affective disorders but findings in unipolar MDD are not consistent. The current study aimed to investigate whether the Hb volume differed between patients with different stages of unipolar MDD and healthy subjects. We also explored differences in grey (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes and potential age and gender effects. High-resolution images were acquired using a 3T-scanner from 95 participants (21 with first-episode MDD; 20 with remitted-recurrent MDD; 20 with treatment-resistant/chronic MDD; and 34 healthy controls).Two researchers blinded to clinical data manually delineated habenular nuclei, with excellent inter-rater agreement. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group-by-gender interaction (F9,258=2.22; p=0.02). Univariate effects emerged for Hb-WM volumes (F3,86=3.12; p=0.03) but not for total Hb volumes (F3,86=0.59; p=0.62) or Hb-GM volumes (F3,86=2.01; p=0.12). Women with a first-episode MDD had greater Hb-WM volumes than healthy controls and patients with treatment-resistant/chronic MDD (p&lt;0.01). These findings remained unaltered when controlled for total intracranial volume or medication load. Our results do not support decreased total Hb volumes in unipolar MDD, in patients with first-episode or in patients with long-lasting recurrent or chronic depression. However, the increased Hb-WM volume we observed in women with a first-episode suggests involvement of Hb and its projections in early stages of the recovery process and in the course of MD.
ase cool white-light emitting BaNb2O6:Dy(3+) phosphors have been synthesized via a conventional solid-state reaction method and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and spectrofluorophotometric measurements. XRD and Rietveld structural refinement studies confirm that all the samples exhibit pure orthorhombic structure [space group -C2221(20)]. SEM observations reveal the dense particle packaging with irregular morphology in a micron range. The as-prepared phosphors exhibit blue (482 nm) and yellow (574 nm) emissions under 349, 364, 386 and 399 nm excitations corresponding to (4)F9/2→(6)HJ (J = 15/2, 13/2) transitions of Dy(3+) ions. The energy transfer mechanism between Dy(3+) ions has been studied in detail and the luminescence decay lifetime for the (4)F9/2 level was found to be around 146.07 μs for the optimized phosphor composition. The calculated Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates for the optimized phosphor are (x = 0.322, y = 0.339), which are close to the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) (x = 0.310, y = 0.316) coordinates. The values of CIE chromaticity coordinates and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5907 K endorse cool white-light emission from the phosphor. The study reveals that BaNb2O6:Dy(3+) phosphor could be a potential candidate for near ultra-violet (NUV) excited white-LED application.
 Dy complexes have been prepared according to a complex-as-ligand strategy. Structural determinations indicate that the central Dy ion is surrounded by two LZn units (L(2-) is the di-deprotonated form of the N2 O2 compartmental N,N'-2,2-dimethylpropylenedi(3-methoxysalicylideneiminato) Schiff base. The Dy ions are nonacoordinate to eight oxygen atoms from the two L ligands and to a water molecule. The Zn ions are pentacoordinate in all cases, linked to the N2 O2 atoms from L, and the apical position of the Zn coordination sphere is occupied by a water molecule or bromide or chloride ions. These resulting complexes, formulated (LZnX)-Dy-(LZnX), are tricationic with X=H2 O and monocationic with X=Br or Cl. They behave as field-free single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with effective energy barriers (Ueff ) for the reversal of the magnetization of 96.9(6) K with τ0 =2.4×10(-7)  s, 146.8(5) K with τ0 =9.2×10(-8)  s, and 146.1(10) K with τ0 =9.9×10(-8)  s for compounds with ZnOH2 , ZnBr, and ZnCl motifs, respectively. The Cole-Cole plots exhibit semicircular shapes with α parameters in the range of 0.19 to 0.29, which suggests multiple relaxation processes. Under a dc applied magnetic field of 1000 Oe, the quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) is partly or fully suppressed and the energy barriers increase to Ueff =128.6(5) K and τ0 =1.8×10(-8)  s for 1, Ueff =214.7 K and τ0 =9.8×10(-9)  s for 2, and Ueff =202.4 K and τ0 =1.5×10(-8)  s for 3. The two pairs of largely negatively charged phenoxido oxygen atoms with short DyO bonds are positioned at opposite sides of the Dy(3+) ion, which thus creates a strong crystal field that stabilizes the axial MJ =±15/2 doublet as the ground Kramers doublet. Although the compound with the ZnOH2 motifs possesses the larger negative charges on the phenolate oxygen atoms, as confirmed by using DFT calculations, it exhibits the larger distortions of the DyO9 coordination polyhedron from ideal geometries and a smaller Ueff value. Ab initio calculations support the easy-axis anisotropy of the ground Kramers doublet and predict zero-field SMM behavior through Orbach and TA-QTM relaxations via the first excited Kramers doublet, which leads to large energy barriers. In accordance with the experimental results, ab initio calculations have also shown that, compared with water, the peripheral halide ligands coordinated to the Zn(2+) ions increase the barrier height when the distortions of the DyO9 have a negative effect. All the complexes exhibit metal-centered luminescence after excitation into the UV π-π* absorption band of ligand L(2-) at λ=335 nm, which results in the appearance of the characteristic Dy(III) ((4) F9/2 →(6) HJ/2 ; J=15/2, 13/2) emission bands in the visible regio.
rombosis (VT) is a common multifactorial disease with a genetic component that was first suspected nearly 60 years ago. In this review, we document the genetic determinants of the disease, and update recent findings delivered by the application of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies. To date, 17 genes have been robustly demonstrated to harbour genetic variations associated with VT risk: ABO, F2, F5, F9, F11, FGG, GP6, KNG1, PROC, PROCR, PROS1, SERPINC1, SLC44A2, STXBP5, THBD, TSPAN15 and VWF. The common polymorphisms are estimated to account only for a modest part (~5 %) of the VT heritability. Much remains to be done to fully disentangle the exact genetic (and epigenetic) architecture of the disease. A large suite of powerful tools and research strategies can be deployed on the large collections of patients that have already been assembled (and additional are ongoing.
ontent (PC) is a crucial factor that determines the end-use and nutritional quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Glutamine synthetase (GS), which is a major participant in nitrogen metabolism, can convert inorganic nitrogen into organic nitrogen. Although many studies have been conducted on PC and GS, a dynamic analysis of all of the filling stages has not been conducted. Therefore, 115 F9-10 recombinant inbred wheat lines of 'R131/R142' were used to analyze PC and GS activity during different developmental stages, using the conditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping method. Twenty-two and six conditional QTL were detected for PC and GS activily, respectively. More QTL in leaf PC were detected during the early filling stages than in the later filling stages. Grain PC QTL displayed different dynamic variations to leaf PC QTL during the entire grain-filling stages. All of the QTL were expressed differently over time, and nine conditional QTL were detected across two filling stages. QTL with similar functions may have tended to group in specific locales. This study provides dynamic genetic information on protein accumulation during grain-filling stage.
nverting nanocrystals of KLa0.95Er0.05Y bxP4O12 and La0.95-xEr0.05Y bxP5O14 were prepared using co-precipitation method. The spectroscopic properties of these materials were investigated in a function of Y b(3+) concentration. The up-conversion emission, power dependence of emission intensities, and the luminescence decay times were investigated. It was found that the green to red and (2)H11/2 → (4)I15/2 to (4)S3/2 → (4)I15/2 emission intensity ratio were strongly affected by the Y b(3+) concentration. Moreover, the order of up-conversion emission and threshold power rises up with Y b(3+) concentration for (4)S3/2 → (4)I15/2 transition. The luminescence decay time of the (4)S3/2 → (4)I15/2 emission increases with Y b(3+) concentration while the (4)F9/2 → (4)I15/2 emission is independent of dopant concentration. The influence of the Y b(3+) concentration on the up-conversion emission intensities was discussed in terms of concentration dependent hetero looped photon avalanche process. A comparison of the up-conversion properties of KLa0.95Er0.05Y bxP4O12 and La0.95-xEr0.05Y bxP5O14 nanocrystals was presente.
ons are common in natural populations and the outcome of their interactions depends on the immune responses of the host elicited by the parasites. Earlier we showed that immunization with BmAFII (Sephadex G-200 eluted) fraction of human lymphatic filaria Brugia malayi inhibited progression of Leishmania donovani infection in golden hamsters. In the present study we identified cross reactive molecules of B. malayi, and investigated their effect on L. donovani infection and associated immune responses in the host. The sequence alignment and sharing of linear T- and B-cell epitopes in protein molecules of B. malayi and L. donovani counterparts were studied in silico. Hamsters were immunized with robustly cross reactive SDS-PAGE resolved fractions F6 (54.2-67.8kDa) and F9 (41.3-45.0kDa) of B. malayi and subsequently inoculated with amastigotes of L. donovani intracardially. F6 inhibited (∼72%) L. donovani infection and upregulated Th1 cytokine expression, lymphoproliferation, IgG2, IgG2/3 levels and NO production, and downregulated Th2 cytokine expression. Sequences in HSP60 and EF-2 of F6 and L. donovani counterparts were conserved and B- and T-cell epitopes in the proteins shared antigenic regions. In conclusion, leishmania-cross reactive molecules of filarial parasite considerably inhibited leishmanial infection via Th1-mediated immune responses and NO production. Common B- and T-cell epitope regions in HSP60 and EF-2 of the parasites might have contributed to the inhibitory effect on the L. donovani infection. Thus, leishmania-cross reactive filarial parasite molecules may help in designing prophylactic(s) against L. donovan.
d extract (GSE) has antiviral activities against hepatitis A virus (HAV) and human norovirus surrogates (feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) and murine norovirus (MNV-1)). The objectives of this study were to determine (1) time and dose-dependence of GSE against FCV-F9, MNV-1, and HAV at room temperature (RT) and 37&nbsp;°C over 24&nbsp;h; and (2) GSE effects in model foods (apple juice (AJ) and 2% milk) and simulated gastric conditions at 37&nbsp;°C. Viruses at ∼5&nbsp;log&nbsp;PFU/ml were treated with 0.5-8&nbsp;mg/ml GSE prepared in water, AJ, milk or gastric juices, or water over 24&nbsp;h at RT or 37&nbsp;°C. Infectivity of triplicate treatments was evaluated using plaque assays. GSE effects increased with time and concentration. GSE at 1&nbsp;mg/ml in AJ reduced MNV-1 to undetectable levels after 1&nbsp;h and by 1 log in milk after 24&nbsp;h. GSE at 1 and 2&nbsp;mg/ml in AJ reduced HAV to undetectable levels after 1&nbsp;h, while 2 and 4&nbsp;mg/ml GSE in milk caused ∼1 log reduction after 24&nbsp;h. GSE at 2&nbsp;mg/ml in intestinal fluid reduced FCV-F9, MNV-1 and HAV to undetectable levels after 6&nbsp;h. GSE appears to be a suitable natural option for foodborne viral reductio.
s a serious public health problem, the control of which involves actions directed against its vector, mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles Meigan, 1818. The study of insect biology, ecology, and behavior is simplified when these insects are maintained at the laboratory. However, many of the species are eurygamic and require induced mating. Females of Anopheles marajoara Galvão e Damasceno, 1942 were collected at Mazagão county, State of Amapá, Brazil. F1 eggs were obtained through forced oviposition and raised until mosquito emergence. Around 300 mosquitoes were maintained in each cage and were fed with a 10% sugar solution. Induced mating was made to obtain the other generations. Females had their spermathecae examined for the presence of sperm. The efficacy of coupling in each generation was evaluated. The viability of a sample of generations F5, F9, F12, and F14 was followed from larvae to adult. Two free mating attempts were done. The results demonstrate adaptation of An. marajoara to laboratory conditions over 21 generations, with viability rates temporally increasing. There was no evidence of adaptation to free matin.
one (TQ), obtained from black cumin (Nigella sativa), is a natural product with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects but unfortunately with poor bioavailability. Aiming to improve its poor oral bioavailability, TQ-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were prepared by high-speed homogenization followed by ultrasonication and evaluated in vitro. Bioavailability and pharmacodynamic studies were also performed. The resultant NLCs showed poor physical homogeneity in Compritol 888 ATO Pluronic F127 system which consequently produced larger particle size and polydispersity index, smaller zeta potential values, and lower short-term (30&nbsp;days) physical stability than other systems. Encapsulation efficiency percentage (EE%) lied between 84.6 ± 5% and 96.2 ± 1.6%. TQ AUC0-t values were higher in animals treated with NLCs, with a relative bioavailability of 2.03- and 3.97-fold (for F9 and F12, respectively) higher than TQ suspension, indicating bioavailability enhancement by NLC formulation. Hepatoprotective effects of F12 showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in both serum alanine amino transferase and aspartate amino transferase to reach 305.0 ± 24.88 and 304.7 ± 23.55&nbsp;U/ml, respectively, when compared with untreated toxic group. Anti-oxidant efficacy of F12 showed significant (P &lt; 0.05) decline of malondialdehyde and elevation of reduced glutatione. This improvement was also confirmed histopathologicall.
size is a significant parameter which determines the environmental fate and the behavior of dust particles and, implicitly, the exposure risk of humans to particle-bound contaminants. Currently, the influence of dust particle size on the occurrence and seasonal variation of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) remains unclear. While HBCDs are now restricted by the Stockholm Convention, information regarding HBCD contamination in indoor dust in China is still limited. We analyzed composite dust samples from offices (n = 22), hotels (n = 3), kindergartens (n = 2), dormitories (n = 40), and main roads (n = 10). Each composite dust sample (one per type of microenvironment) was fractionated into 9 fractions (F1-F9: 2000-900, 900-500, 500-400, 400-300, 300-200, 200-100, 100-74, 74-50, and &lt;50 μm). Total HBCD concentrations ranged from 5.3 (road dust, F4) to 2580 ng g(-1) (dormitory dust, F4) in the 45 size-segregated samples. The seasonality of HBCDs in indoor dust was investigated in 40 samples from two offices. A consistent seasonal trend of HBCD levels was evident with dust collected in the winter being more contaminated with HBCDs than dust from the summer. Particle size-selection strategy for dust analysis has been found to be influential on the HBCD concentrations, while overestimation or underestimation would occur with improper strategie.
) and Er(3+) codoped orthorhombic LuF3 rectangular nanocrystals (NCs) with the size of about 10nm were synthesized by a facile and effective solvothermal process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), upconversion (UC) luminescence spectra and decay curves were used to characterize the resulting samples. Compared with YF3 and α-NaYF4 NCs, owning the similar size and the same doping levels of Yb(3+) ions and Er(3+) ions as LuF3 NCs, the green UC emission of LuF3 NCs is 18.7 times and 5.1 times stronger than that of YF3 and α-NaYF4 NCs respectively; the red UC emission of LuF3 NCs is 13.2 times and 0.6 times stronger than that of YF3 and α-NaYF4 NCs respectively. Under 980nm wavelength excitation, the decay curves of both (4)S3/2→(4)I15/2 transition and (4)F9/2→(4)I15/2 transition exhibit a single exponential function, resulting from the fast energy migrations among Yb(3+) ions caused by the high concentration of Yb(3+) ions (20mol%). Meanwhile, at relatively low power density, the slopes of the linear plots between log(I) and log(P) for green UC and red UC are 1.7 and 1.9 respectively, which are less than 2 due to the quenching of the thermal effect, indicating a two-photon process for them. At high power density, the slopes are decreased caused by the saturation effect. In addition, we proved the existence of the thermal effect by the pump power dependence of the intensity ratio of (2)H11/2→(4)I15/2 transition to (4)S3/2→(4)I15/2 transitio.
opment of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a promising class of anti-cancer agents, has traditionally relied on the use of antibodies capable of selective internalization in tumor cells. We have recently shown that also non-internalizing antibodies, coupled to cytotoxic drugs by means of disulfide linkers that can be cleaved in the tumor extracellular environment, can display a potent therapeutic activity. Here, we have compared the tumor targeting properties, drug release rates and therapeutic performance of two antibody-drug conjugates, based on the maytansinoid DM1 thiol drug and on the F8 antibody, directed against the alternatively-spliced EDA domain of fibronectin. The antibody was used in IgG or in small immune protein (SIP) format. In both cases, DM1 was coupled to unpaired cysteine residues, resulting in a drug-antibody ratio of 2. In biodistribution studies, SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 accumulated in the tumor and cleared from circulation more rapidly than IgG(F8)-SS-DM1. However, the ADC based on the IgG format exhibited a higher tumor uptake at later time points (e.g., 33 %IA/g against 8 %IA/g at 24 h after intravenous administration). In mouse plasma, surprisingly, the ADC products in IgG format were substantially more stable compared to the SIP format (half-lives &gt; 48 h and &lt; 3 h at 37 ºC, respectively), revealing a novel mechanism for the control of disulfide-based drug release rates. Therapy experiments in immunocompetent mice bearing murine F9 tumors revealed that SIP(F8)-SS-DM1 was more efficacious than IgG(F8)-SS-DM1 when the two products were compared either in an equimolar basis or at equal milligram dose.
version luminescence (UCL) is selectively enhanced by about 7 times via Fe(3+) codoping into a NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystalline lattice. The maximum red-to-green ratio (R/G) as well as the overall integrated UCL intensity features at an Fe(3+) content of 20 mol%. The size and phase of nanocrystals are simultaneously manipulated via Fe(3+) doping with various concentrations by a facile hydrothermal method. Contrary to the literature, the pure hexagonal phase appears when Fe(3+) concentrations are from 5 to 20 mol%, meanwhile, the size of NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals reaches its maximum at 10 mol%. The intensified visible UCL especially the dominant red emission is mainly ascribed to the energy transfer (ET) from |(2)F7/2, (4)T1g &gt; (Yb(3+)-Fe(3+) dimer) to (4)F9/2 (Er(3+)) states as well as the distortion of the crystalline field symmetry upon Fe(3+) codoping. Dynamic investigation of (4)S3/2 and (4)F9/2 states under the pulsed laser excitation of 980 nm along with the diffuse reflectance data further supports the proposed mechanism of UC processes. The results show the remarkable promise of Fe(3+)-codoped NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals as upconverting nanoprobes with high sensitivity and penetrability in deeper tissue for multimodal biomedical imagin.
analyses reported a higher risk of recurrent venous thrombosis in men than wome.
to assess the risk of recurrence in men compared with women whilst taking female reproductive risk factors (oral contraception, postmenopausal hormone therapy and pregnancy) into account. In addition, we hypothesized that the sex difference in venous thrombosis was related to F9 Malmö, an X-linked prothrombotic facto.
ooled European cohorts (CARROT study, Glasgow, UK; CVTE study, Cambridge, UK; AUREC study, Vienna, Austria; and LETS follow-up study, Leiden, the Netherlands), the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis was calculated in men, women with reproductive risk factors and women without reproductive risk factors at the time of their first venous thrombosis. F9 Malmö was genotyped and carriers and non-carriers contraste.
 2185 patients with a first venous thrombosis, 1043 men and 1142 women, were included. Overall, men had a 2.8-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-3.4) higher risk of recurrent venous thrombosis than women. This risk was 5.2-fold (95% CI, 3.5-7.7) higher in men than in women with reproductive risk factors, and 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.7-3.2) higher in men than in women without reproductive risk factors. No difference in risk of recurrence was found for carriers vs. non-carriers of F9 Malm.
ienced a recurrent venous thrombosis twice as often as women without reproductive risk factors. These findings indicate that men have a higher intrinsic risk of venous thrombosis than women, which is partly masked by female reproductive risk factors. The sex difference cannot be explained by F9 Malm.
licivirus (FCV) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes oral and upper respiratory tract disease in cats. Despite widespread vaccination, the prevalence of FCV remains high. Furthermore, a high gene mutation rate has led to the emergence of variants, and some infections are lethal. To date, there is no effective antiviral drug available for treating FCV infection. Here, we show that lithium chloride (LiCl) effectively suppresses the replication of FCV strain F9 in Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The antiviral activity of LiCl occurred primarily during the early stage of infection and in a dose-dependent manner. LiCl treatment also inhibited the cytopathic effect. LiCl treatment exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against a panel of other two reference strains and two recent FCV isolates from China. These results demonstrate that LiCl might be an effective anti-FCV drug for controlling FCV disease. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral activity of LiCl against FCV replication in viv.
ve memory refers to remembering the association between two items, such as a face and a name. It is a crucial part of daily life, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is impacted by aging and by Alzheimer<span lang="hi-IN">׳</span>s disease. Evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can improve memory performance, but few tDCS studies have investigated its impact on associative memory. In addition, no prior study of the effects of tDCS on memory performance has systematically evaluated the impact of tDCS on different types of memory assessments, such as recognition and recall tests. In this study, we measured the effects of tDCS on associative memory performance in healthy adults, using both recognition and recall tests. Participants studied face-name pairs while receiving either active (30min, 2mA) or sham (30min, 0.1mA) stimulation with the anode placed at F9 and the cathode placed on the contralateral upper arm. Participants in the active stimulation group performed significantly better on the recall test than participants in the sham group, recalling 50% more names, on average, and making fewer recall errors. However, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of their performance on the recognition memory test. This investigation provides evidence that stimulation at the time of study improves associative memory encoding, but that this memory benefit is evident only under certain retrieval condition.
 is a one-pot vicinal fluorination-iodination of arynes at room temperature. The diphenyliodonium salt proved to be a privileged catalyst for this nucleophilic fluorination process using CsF as a fluorine source, and a subsequent facile electrophilic iodination with C4 F9 I was also found to be crucial to ensure the efficient fluorination. This new synthetic protocol has a broad substrate scope under mild reaction condition.
 disease (AxD), a fatal degenerative leukoencephalopathy, is caused by de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) gene. The pathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic inclusions in astrocytes, composed mainly of GFAP, αB-crystallin and HSP27. To date, several patients with a typical presentation of the disease or displaying characteristic Rosenthal fibers in brain material have been reported with no GFAP mutation. Recently, several studies have demonstrated a correlation between Rosenthal fiber formation and wild-type GFAP overexpression, despite the absence of mutations. We tested the hypothesis that a GFAP gene rearrangement could modulate AxD severity or promote GFAP overexpression and aggregation, resulting in leukoencephalopathy. A QMPSF assay was validated for 11 exonic fragments: 3 in control genes (CFTR, DSCR1, F9) and 8 corresponding to GFAP exons. A total of 97 patients suspected of AxD were analyzed: 28 with a GFAP mutation; 69 with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging criteria compatible with the disease. Neither duplications nor deletions of GFAP were found, suggesting that GFAP coding-region rearrangements may not be involved in AxD or Alexander-related leukoencephalopathies. In addition, 80 patients with undetermined leukodystrophies, and negative for PLP1, GJA12, Sox10 and MCT8 mutations and PLP1 and Lamin B1 rearrangements, were tested. These patients were also negative for GFAP rearrangements. Other hypotheses should be investigated for a molecular diagnosis in patients with undetermined leukoencephalopathy: mutations in GFAP isoforms, splicing sites or regulatory regions, or defaults in genes encoding molecular partners of GFA.
te sufficient clinical-grade vector to support a phase I/II clinical trial of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated factor IX (FIX) gene transfer for hemophilia B, we have developed a large-scale, good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible method for vector production and purification. We used a 293T-based two-plasmid transient transfection system coupled with a three-column chromatography purification process to produce high-quality self-complementary AAV2/8 FIX clinical-grade vector. Two consecutive production campaigns using a total of 432 independent 10-stack culture chambers produced a total of ∼2 × 10(15) vector genomes (VG) by dot-blot hybridization. Benzonase-treated microfluidized lysates generated from pellets of transfected cells were purified by group separation on Sepharose beads followed by anion-exchange chromatography. The virus-containing fractions were further processed by gel filtration and ultrafiltration, using a 100-kDa membrane. The vector was formulated in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.25% human serum albumin. Spectrophotometric analysis suggested ∼20% full particles, with only low quantities of nonviral proteins were visible on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. A sensitive assay for the detection of replication-competent AAV was developed, which did reveal trace quantities of such contaminants in the final product. Additional studies have confirmed the long-term stability of the vector at -80°C for at least 24 months and for at least 24 hr formulated in the clinical diluent and stored at room temperature within intravenous bags. This material has been approved for use in clinical trials in the United States and the United Kingdo.
 leucine-rich repeat proteins, fibromodulin and osteoadherin, have N-terminal extensions with a variable number of O-sulfated tyrosine residues. This modification combined with a number of aspartic and glutamic acid residues results in a highly negatively charged domain of less than 30 amino acids. We hypothesized that this domain shares functional properties with heparin regarding binding to proteins and polypeptides containing clusters of basic amino acids. Two other family members, PRELP and chondroadherin, have distinctly different clusters of basic amino acids in their N and C termini, respectively, and PRELP is known to bind to heparin via this domain. Another heparin-binding protein is the cytokine Oncostatin M, with a different cluster of basic amino acids in its C terminus. We used polypeptides representing these basic domains in solid phase assays and demonstrate interactions with the negatively charged N-terminal domain of fibromodulin and full-length osteoadherin. The tyrosine sulfate domains also bound heparin-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor-2, thrombospondin I, MMP13, the NC4 domain of collagen IX, and interleukin-10. Fibronectin with large heparin-binding domains did not bind, neither did CILP containing a heparin-binding thrombospondin type I motif without clustered basic amino acids. Affinity depends on the number and position of the sulfated tyrosine residues shown by different binding properties of 10-kDa fragments subfractionated by ion-exchange chromatography. These interactions may sequester growth factors, cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases in the extracellular matrix as well as contribute to its organizatio.
bin, a major regulator of coagulation and angiogenesis, is known to interact with several natural sulfated polysaccharides. Previously, we prepared sulfated low molecular weight variants of natural lignins, called sulfated dehydrogenation polymers (DHPs) (Henry, B. L., Monien, B. H., Bock, P. E., and Desai, U. R. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 31891-31899), which have now been found to exhibit interesting antithrombin binding properties. Sulfated DHPs represent a library of diverse noncarbohydrate aromatic scaffolds that possess structures completely different from heparin and heparan sulfate. Fluorescence binding studies indicate that sulfated DHPs bind to antithrombin with micromolar affinity under physiological conditions. Salt dependence of binding affinity indicates that the antithrombin-sulfated DHP interaction involves a massive 80-87% non-ionic component to the free energy of binding. Competitive binding studies with heparin pentasaccharide, epicatechin sulfate, and full-length heparin indicate that sulfated DHPs bind to both the pentasaccharide-binding site and extended heparin-binding site of antithrombin. Affinity capillary electrophoresis resolves a limited number of peaks of antithrombin co-complexes suggesting preferential binding of selected DHP structures to the serpin. Computational genetic algorithm-based virtual screening study shows that only one sulfated DHP structure, out of the 11 present in a library of plausible sequences, bound in the heparin-binding site with a high calculated score supporting selectivity of recognition. Enzyme inhibition studies indicate that only one of the three sulfated DHPs studied is a potent inhibitor of free factor VIIa in the presence of antithrombin. Overall, the chemo-enzymatic origin and antithrombin binding properties of sulfated DHPs present novel opportunities for potent and selective modulation of the serpin function, especially for inhibiting the initiation phase of hemostasi.
was prepared from human blood plasma (batch size 1200 L). First, prothrombin was isolated by the following separation techniques: cryoprecipitation, ion-exchange chromatography (diethyl aminoethyl, DEAE-IEX), heparin affinity chromatography, a second DEAE-IEX step, and immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC). Prothrombin was then activated to thrombin, which was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and concentrated by ultrafiltration. This process is cost-effective because a waste fraction can be used from one of the steps (heparin affinity chromatography) in the commercial production of plasma-derived Factor IX (FIX). The final thrombin preparation had a purity of approximately 75% (specific activity approximately 2400 IU/mg protein), which is sufficient for its intended purpose in a fibrin glue. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Factor X (FX) activity analysis, and analytical HIC were also used to characterize the thrombin. Three substantially different techniques were used to reduce any viral activity, namely: solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment, pasteurization, and virus filtration (nanofiltration). The manufacturing process presented here would be suitable for large-scale production of thrombin with a high degree of virus safet.
ition of five human carbonic anhydrase (hCA, EC 4.2.1.1) isozymes; the cytosolic hCA I and II, the membrane-bound hCA IV, the mitochondrial hCA V, and the tumor-associated, transmembrane hCA IX, with anions isosteric and isoelectronic with sulfate, nitrate, and carbonate; such as chlorate, perchlorate, bromate, iodate, periodate, silicate, bismuthate, vanadate, molybdate, and wolframate is reported. Apparently, the geometry of the inhibitor (tetrahedral or trigonal) does not influence its binding to the Zn(II) ion of the enzyme active site, but the nature of the central element is the most important factor influencing potency. Isozymes hCA I and II are best inhibited by chlorate, perchlorate, and silicate, together with the anions structurally related to sulfate, sulfamate, and sulfamidate, but sulfate itself is a weak inhibitor (inhibition constant of 74 mM against hCA I and 183 mM against hCA II). Molybdate is a very weak hCA I inhibitor (K(I) of 914 mM) but it interacts with hCA II (K(I) of 27.5mM). Isozyme IV is well inhibited by sulfate (K(I) of 9 mM), sulfamate, and sulfamidate (in the low micromolar range), but not by perchlorate (K(I) of 767 mM). The mitochondrial isozyme V has the lowest affinity for sulfate (K(I) of 680 mM) and carbonate (K(I) of 95 mM) among all the investigated isozymes, suggesting on one hand its possible participation in metabolon(s) with sulfate anion exchanger(s), and on the other hand an evolutionary adaptation to working at higher pH values (around 8.5 in mitochondria) where rather high amounts of carbonate in equilibrium with bicarbonate may be present. Metasilicate, isosteric to carbonate, is also about a 10 times weaker inhibitor of this isozyme as compared to other CAs investigated here (K(I) of 28.2 mM). Surprisingly, the tumor-associated isozyme IX is resistant to sulfate inhibition (K(I) of 154 mM) but has affinity in the low micromolar range for carbonate, sulfamate, and sulfamidate (K(I) in the range of 8.6-9.6 microM). This constitutes another proof that this isozyme best works at acidic pH values present in tumors, being inhibited substantially at higher pH values when more carbonate may be present. Bromate and chlorate are quite weak CA IX inhibitors (K(I) s of 147-274 mM.
n of factor XI (FXI) by thrombin on stimulated platelets plays a physiological role in hemostasis, providing additional thrombin generation required in cases of severe hemostatic challenge. Using a collection of 53 thrombin mutants, we identified 16 mutants with &lt;50% of the wild-type thrombin FXI-activating activity in the presence of dextran sulfate. These mutants mapped to anion-binding exosite (ABE) I, ABE-II, the Na+-binding site, and the 50-insertion loop. Only the ABE-II mutants showed reduced binding to dextran sulfate-linked agarose. Selected thrombin mutants in ABE-I (R68A, R70A, and R73A), ABE-II (R98A, R245A, and K248A), the 50-insertion loop (W50A), and the Na+-binding site (E229A and R233A) with &lt;10% of the wild-type activity also showed a markedly reduced ability to activate FXI in the presence of stimulated platelets. The ABE-I, 50-insertion loop, and Na+-binding site mutants had impaired binding to FXI, but normal binding to glycocalicin, the soluble form of glycoprotein Ibalpha (GPIb alpha). In contrast, the ABE-II mutants were defective in binding to glycocalicin, but displayed normal binding to FXI. Our data support a quaternary complex model of thrombin activation of FXI on stimulated platelets. Thrombin bound to one GPIb alpha molecule, via ABE-II on its posterior surface, is properly oriented for its activation of FXI bound to a neighboring GPI alpha molecule, via ABE-I on its anterior surface. GPIb alpha plays a critical role in the co-localization of thrombin and FXI and the resultant efficient activation of FX.
agulant protein was purified from the edible portion of a blood ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii, by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Sephadex G- 75, DEAE-Sephacel, and Biogel P-100. In vitro assays with human plasma, the anticoagulant from S. broughtonii, prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and inhibited the factor IX in the intrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade. But, the fibrin plate assay did not show that the anticoagulant is a fibrinolytic protease. The molecular mass of the purified S. broughtonii anticoagulant was measured to be about 26.0 kDa by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column and SDSPAGE under denaturing conditions. The optimum activity in the APTT assay was exhibited at pH 7.0-7.5 and 40-45 degrees C in the presence of Ca(2+.
action between platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib alpha and von Willebrand factor (VWF) is essential for initiation of hemostasis. The sulfation of the 3 tyrosine residues 276, 278, and 279 in GPIb alpha is an important posttranslational modification that seems to promote the interaction with VWF. The environment where sulfation of tyrosines occurs has been proposed to contain highly acidic residues. This investigation has examined the highly acidic region from Asp249 to Asp287 in the mature GPIb alpha protein. Changes to most of the carboxylic acids in this region resulted in decreased reactivity to VWF. Only 3 mutants (Glu270Gln, Asp283Asn, Asp283Asn/Glu285Gln/Asp287Asn) resulted in the abolition of sulfation. Two novel mutations were also created. First, a deletion of the 7 amino acids from Tyr276 to Glu282 led to a loss of sulfation and totally abolished VWF binding in the presence of botrocetin. This confirms that it is these 3 tyrosines that undergo sulfation and that this region is crucial for botrocetin-mediated VWF binding. The second mutation involves changing the lysine residues at 253, 258, and 262 to alanine. This also led to distinct changes in VWF binding and abolition of sulfatio.
 binds to high affinity sites on the surface of stimulated platelets where it is efficiently activated by thrombin. Here, we provide evidence that the factor XI binding site on platelets is in the glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha subunit of the GP Ib-IX-V complex as follows. 1) Bernard-Soulier platelets, lacking the complex, are deficient in factor XI binding; 2) two GP Ibalpha ligands, SZ-2 (a monoclonal antibody) and bovine von Willebrand factor, inhibit factor XI binding to platelets; 3) by surface plasmon resonance, factor XI bound specifically to glycocalicin (the extracellular domain of GP Ibalpha) in Zn(2+)-dependent fashion (K(d)( app) approximately 52 nm). We then investigated whether glycocalicin could promote factor XI activation by thrombin, another GP Ibalpha ligand. In the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (45 nm), Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions, thrombin activated factor XI in the presence of glycocalicin at rates comparable with those seen in the presence of dextran sulfate (1 microg/ml). With higher high molecular weight kininogen concentrations (360 nm), the rate of thrombin-catalyzed factor XI activation in the presence of glycocalicin was comparable with that on activated platelets. Thus, factor XI binds to the GP Ib-IX-V complex, promoting its activation by thrombi.
factor IX preparations from human plasma (pdFIX) have been characterized using electrophoretic methods like sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Factor IX prior to and after activation with factor XIa was separated by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and on isoelectric focusing gels. The main differences between the band patterns of the two pdFIX preparations are due to their purity. Vitronectin was identified by immunological techniques as major accompanying plasma protein, separated from factor IX and characterized by isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresi.
glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha is a component of the GPIb-IX receptor complex, which is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, including platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury, thrombin binding, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelet-type von Willebrand disease, and immune-mediated thrombocytopenias. The amino-terminal domain of approximately 300 residues of GPIbalpha mediates both normal biological function (by providing the sites for direct ligand interaction) and aberrant function (through amino acid substitutions). To investigate the molecular interactions mediated by this region of GPIbalpha, we have developed a recombinant baculovirus to facilitate its expression as a calmodulin fusion protein from insect cells. By employing the calmodulin tag, the fusion protein could be obtained at &gt;90% purity after a single isolation step at yields of 8 mg/L of insect cell medium (purified fusion protein). The recombinant GPIbalpha fragment was shown to be posttranslationally sulfated and glycosylated, although its glycosylation differed from that of the equivalent GPIbalpha fragment isolated from human platelets. The differential glycosylation, however, did not affect the function of the recombinant GPIbalpha fragment in either von Willebrand factor (vWf) or thrombin binding as these were both found to be identical to those of the same-length GPIbalpha fragment derived from human platelets. The calmodulin tag was also exploited in the development of assays to measure directly vWf and thrombin binding, since it did not interfere with either, demonstrating the feasibility for the use of this soluble receptor fusion protein in detailed biophysical assays to investigate the molecular mode of binding of platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha to these ligand.
ta demonstrate that the introduction into skeletal muscle of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing blood coagulation factor IX (F.IX) can result in long-term expression of the transgene product and amelioration of the bleeding diathesis in animals with hemophilia B. These data suggest that biologically active F.IX can be synthesized in skeletal muscle. Factor IX undergoes extensive posttranslational modifications in the liver, the normal site of synthesis. In addition to affecting specific activity, these posttranslational modifications can also affect recovery, half-life in the circulation, and the immunogenicity of the protein. Before initiating a human trial of an AAV-mediated, muscle-directed approach for treating hemophilia B, a detailed biochemical analysis of F.IX synthesized in skeletal muscle was carried out. As a model system, human myotubes transduced with an AAV vector expressing F.IX was used. F.IX was purified from conditioned medium using a novel strategy designed to purify material representative of all species of rF.IX in the medium. Purified F.IX was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), N-terminal sequence analysis, chemical gamma-carboxyglutamyl analysis, carbohydrate analysis, assays for tyrosine sulfation, and serine phosphorylation, and for specific activity. Results show that myotube-synthesized F.IX has specific activity similar to that of liver-synthesized F.IX. Posttranslational modifications critical for specific activity, including removal of the signal sequence and propeptide, and gamma-carboxylation of the N-terminal glutamic acid residues, are also similar, but carbohydrate analysis and assessment of tyrosine sulfation and serine phosphorylation disclose differences. In vivo experiments in mice showed that these differences affect recovery but not half-life of muscle-synthesized F.I.
oagulant effect of Vespa orientalis venom sac extract (VSE) was attributed to a proteolytic process, involving mainly coagulation factors VIII and IX [Joshua, H., Ishay, J., 1975. Toxicon 13, 11-20; Korenberg et al., 1988. Toxicon 26, 1169-1176]. Preliminary purification of the proteolytic activity showed the presence of three separate proteases. One of which, protease I, was purified. The purified enzyme migrated as a double band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE). The molecular weights of the bands, under reduced conditions were 42 and 44 kD. Both bands retained activity after the electrophoretic run. The enzyme hydrolyses bovine factor IX (BFIX), factor X (BFX) and prothrombin. The pH optimum for the degradation of BFIX was 7.0 and its isoelectric point is above pH 10. The amino acid composition of the protease was determine.
 structure of crystal form IX of bovine pancre- atic ribonuclease A (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1)) is reported at 1.6 A resolution. The structure was refined to an R factor of 15.0% and includes coordinates for two sulfate ions, four methanol molecules and 82 waters. The structure could be superimposed on the highest resolution crystal structure of bovine pancreatic fibonuclease available (in space group P2(1)) with an r.m.s, difference in main-chain atomic positions of 0.51 A. Most of the larger differences between the two structures could be related to crystal lattice contacts. Superposition of the new structure with eight other structures of ribonuclease in six crystal forms resulted in an r.m.s, deviation from the average structure of 0.43 A for all main-chain atoms. This similarity among structures exists in spite of the fact that all nine molecules are in different crystal environment.
ood vessel is injured, control of bleeding starts with the rapid adhesion of circulating platelets to the site of damage. Within seconds, the adhered platelets are activated, secrete the contents of storage organelles, spread out over the damaged area and recruit more platelets to the developing thrombus. However, if this same process occurs in a diseased, sclerotic or occluded vessel, the resulting platelet thrombus may break away and block the coronary artery, causing a heart attack, or restrict blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke. The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, a member of the leucine-rich protein family, is a constitutive platelet membrane receptor for von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a multimeric adhesive glycoprotein found in the matrix underlying the endothelial cell lining of the blood vessel wall and in the plasma. Binding of vWF to the GP. Ib-IX-V complex regulates adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium at high shear flow, and initiates signal transduction leading to platelet activation. The GP Ib-IX-V complex also constitutes a binding site for alpha-thrombin, an interaction that facilitates thrombin-dependent platelet activation. This review will focus on recent detailed analysis of the GP Ib-IX-V complex and vWF that has identified discrete amino acid sequences that mediate their interaction. An anionic/sulfated tyrosine sequence of the GP Ib alpha-chain that is critical for binding of the GP Ib-IX-V complex to both vWF and alpha-thrombin is analogous to sulfated anionic amino acid sequences mediating interactions of other adhesive proteins, including P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 and Factor VIII binding to vW.
protein (GP) Ib-IX complex mediates platelet aggregation in response to high shear forces by binding von Willebrand factor (vWF) in the plasma. We investigated the possibility that the complex could mediate a similar phenomenon if expressed in nonhematopoietic cells. When agitated on a tabletop shaker, CHO and L cells expressing the full complex formed large aggregates in the presence of vWF and the modulator ristocetin. When the rate of agitation was increased, aggregation occurred without added ristocetin and appeared to require only the application of a physical force. The aggregation was homophilic and temperature-dependent and required a functional ligand-binding subunit of the GP Ib-IX complex, GP Ib alpha. Posttranslational tyrosine sulfation of GP Ib alpha was required for aggregate formation and stability. Thus, aggregation of cells expressing the GP Ib-IX complex is a unique example of a ligand-receptor interaction induced by mechanical forces and demonstrates an important biological role for sulfation of tyrosine residue.
nce spectra of hematoporphyrin IX (Hp) in water and in aqueous SDS solutions are obtained in the pH range 0.1 to 13 to determine the ionisation state of the molecule as a function of pH. In water, the spectra are complicated by aggregation which is quite severe near pH 4. In aqueous SDS, the aggregation is much less violent. Factor analysis (FA) is used to identify five species in the fluorescence spectra in each series of solutions. The distribution curve of these species as a function of pH is also obtained. By comparing the spectra and the distribution curve of Hp with those of HPPEEA, an ethanolamide derivative of Hp that does not contain the carboxylic groups (Part 3), the species are identified. For Hp in water we have obtained the following species: the dication in two allotropic forms in the pH range 0 to 5; the monocation (with the charge on an imino nitrogen) in the pH range 2 to 7; and the free base in the pH range 3.5 to 13. The monocation observed by the second derivative technique revealed three subspecies. For Hp in aqueous SDS we have obtained the following species; one dication in the pH range 0 to near 4; one monocation (with the charge on an imino nitrogen) in the pH range 0.5 to 9; three free bases (with no charge on the imino nitrogen) in the pH range 4 to 13. Of the latter, one species is the neutral molecule, another is a dianion (with the charges on the carboxylic side chains), and the third one appearing at pH higher than 10 is an allotropic form of the dianio.
nce spectroscopy of hematoporphyrin IX di-n-propylether diethanolamide (HPPEEA) in aqueous solutions, with and without SDS, was obtained in the pH range from 0.1 to 13. At pH greater than 3, HPPEEA in water solutions gives spectra complicated by aggregation whereas in aqueous SDS solutions, the aggregation is greatly reduced. Factor analysis is used to separate the spectra of the individual species from the experimental spectra. Five and four species are identified in pure water and in aqueous SDS solutions, respectively. The predominant species are: two free bases at pH higher than 6; one monocation at pH near 4; and two or one dications at pH lower than 2.5. The intensity signatures are related to the ionic distribution and to the aggregation situation of HPPEEA at different p.
of gene loci have recently been shown to harbor mutations that cause human chondrodysplasias. They encode proteins that occupy cartilage matrix, such as types II, IX, X and XI collagens and COMP, that transduce signals in the growth plate, i.e., FGFR3 and PTHrP receptor, that influence the transport and metabolism of sulfate ions in relevant cells, e.g., DTDST and arylsulfatase E, and that regulate transcription of other genes, such as SOX9. Mutations at two loci, COL2A1 and FGFR3, account for most patients with chondrodysplasias--those with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and the achondroplasia classes of disorders, respectively. Mutations in the former tend to be dispersed throughout the gene and in other functionally related genes, whereas mutations in the latter are restricted to a few codons that seem to be very mutabl.
ependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), when untreated or poorly controlled in mammals, results in growth retardation. To determine whether the same relationship exists in an ectothermic vertebrate, IDDM-like symptoms were induced in a teleost fish, the goby Gillichthys mirabilis, by surgical removal of its pancreatic endocrine (islet) organ. Isletectomized (Ix) gobies lost body weight, their skeletal growth was retarded, as measured by changes in body length, and they exhibited a 50% reduction in cartilage 35SO4 incorporation in vitro, consistent with changes that occur in mammals with IDDM. Injections of bovine insulin into the Ix fish restored body growth parameters to control levels and stimulated cartilage 35SO4 incorporation in a dose-related manner. In contrast to mammals with IDDM, which are resistant to GH action, injection of teleost GH stimulated cartilage 35SO4 incorporation in the Ix fish. Furthermore, whereas cartilage from rats with IDDM is resistant to stimulation by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in vitro, cartilage explants from the Ix fish were highly responsive to recombinant bovine IGF-I, exhibiting a dose-dependent stimulation of 35SO4 incorporation. As far as we are aware, these results represent the first demonstration of diabetic growth inhibition in an ectothermic vertebrate. This inhibition is similar to that which occurs in mammals with IDDM in some respects, but is different in others, as the diabetic fish did not develop resistance to growth stimulation by either GH or IGF-I. While these results support a role for insulin in maintaining the GH-IGF-I-growth axis in this ectothermic vertebrate, there may be important differences in the role of insulin in the promotion of anabolic processe.
idual emission and energy transfer between Ce(3+) and Eu(2+) or Dy(3+) in BaCa(SO4 )2 mixed alkaline earth sulfate phosphor prepared using a co-precipitation method is described. The phosphor was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL) studies and doped by Ce;Eu and Dy rare earths. All phosphors showed excellent blue-orange emission on excitation with UV light. PL measurements reveal that the emission intensity of Eu(2+) or Dy(3+) dopants is greater than when they are co-doped with Ce(3+) . An efficient Ce(3+)  → Eu(2+) [(2) T2g (4f(6) 5d) → (8) S7/2 (4f7 )] and Ce(3+)  → Dy(3+) ((4)  F9/2  → (6) H15/2 and (4)  F9/2  → (6) H13/2 ) energy transfer takes place in the BaCa(SO4 )2 host. A strong blue emission peak was observed at 462 nm for Eu(2+) ions and an orange emission peak at 574 nm for Dy(3+) ions. Hence, this phosphor may be used as a lamp phosphor.

a cocos mycelia yielded via a pilot scale facility-fermentation tank, a water-insoluble (1--&gt;3)-alpha-D-glucan coded as Pi-PCM3-I was isolated by extraction with 0.5 M NaOH/0.01 M NaBH(4) aqueous solution. Nine fractions from F1 to F9 with a weight-average molecular mass (M(w)) range from 7.75 x 10(4) to 57.3 x 10(4) were prepared from the Pi-PCM3-I sample by a nonsolvent addition method. The fractions were reacted with chlorosulfonic acid-pyridine complex to product water-soluble sulfated derivatives coded as S1 to S8 with M(w) from 2.36 x 10(4) to 14.5 x 10(4) and degree of substitution (DS) of 0.86-1.38. M(w), z-average radius of gyration (s(2) (z) (1/2)), the second virial coefficient (A(2)), and the intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) of the native and sulfated Pi-PCM3-I were measured by laser light scattering (LLS), size-exclusion chromatography combined with LLS (SEC-LLS), and viscometry at 25 degrees C. The Mark-Houwink equations for Pi-PCM3-I in 0.25 M LiCl/dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Me(2)SO) and for its sulfated derivative in 0.15 M NaCl aqueous solution at 25 degrees C were established to be [eta] = 1.33 x 10(-2) M(w) (0.75+/-0.01) (mL g(-1)) and [eta] = 1.46 x 10(-4) M(w) (1.13+/-0.01) (mL g(-1)), respectively. On the basis of theories for a wormlike cylinder model, the conformational parameters of the native and sulfated Pi-PCM3-I were calculated to be 760 +/- 50 and 1060 +/- 30 nm(-1) for the molar mass per unit contour length (M(L)), 6.3 +/- 0.5 and 13.1 +/- 1 nm for the persistence length (q), and 14.9 +/- 0.2 and 31.8 +/- 1 for the characteristic ratio (C( proportional, variant)), respectively. The results revealed that Pi-PCM3-I existed as an extended flexible chain in 0.25 M LiCl/Me(2)SO, and its sulfated derivative existed as a semistiff chain in 0.15 M NaCl aqueous solution. Furthermore, Pi-PCM3-I possessed similar structure and molecular parameters to wc-PCM3-I from a rotary shaker; this suggests promising industrialization of Poria cocos polysaccharide.
tand the mechanisms that control anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSact) biosynthesis, we previously showed that HSact production in the F9 system is determined by the abundance of 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 as well as the size of the HSact precursor pool. In this study, HSact precursor structures have been studied by characterizing [6-3H]GlcN metabolically labeled F9 HS tagged with 3-O-sulfates in vitro by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phospho-35S and purified 3-O-sulfotransferase-1. This later in vitro labeling allows the regions of HS destined to become the antithrombin (AT)-binding sites to be tagged for subsequent structural studies. It was shown that six 3-O-sulfation sites exist per HSact precursor chain. At least five out of six 3-O-sulfate-tagged oligosaccharides in HSact precursors bind AT, whereas none of 3-O-sulfate-tagged oligosaccharides from HSinact precursors bind AT. When treated with low pH nitrous or heparitinase, 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact and HSinact precursors exhibit clearly different structural features. 3-O-Sulfate-tagged HSact hexasaccharides were AT affinity purified and sequenced by chemical and enzymatic degradations. The 3-O-sulfate-tagged HSact hexasaccharides exhibited the following structures, DeltaUA-[6-3H]GlcNAc6S-GlcUA-[6-3H]GlcNS3(35)S+/-6S-++ +IdceA2S-[6-3H]Glc NS6S. The underlined 6- and 3-O-sulfates constitute the most critical groups for AT binding in view of the fact that the precursor hexasaccharides possess all the elements for AT binding except for the 3-O-sulfate moiety. The presence of five potential AT-binding precursor hexasaccharides in all HSact precursor chains demonstrates for the first time the processive assembly of specific sequence in HS. The difference in structures around potential 3-O-sulfate acceptor sites in HSact and HSinact precursors suggests that these precursors might be generated by different concerted assembly mechanisms in the same cell. This study permits us to understand better the nature of the HS biosynthetic pathway that leads to the generation of specific saccharide sequence.
ion of bovine oxyhemoglobin with 2,2(1)-dithiobispyridine in the absence and presence of sodium n-dodecyl sulphate has been studied as a function of pH and temperature. The quantitative analysis of the pH dependence of the apparent second order rate constants shows that two ionizable groups are linked to the reaction in the native form. These are His HC3 (146) beta and Cys F9 (93) beta. Their pKa values are 6.5 and 8.5. In the denatured form, only one ionizable group is the modulating factor. This group is Cys F9 (93) beta. Its pKa is 8.35. The activation parameters for the reaction of the denatured form of bovine oxyhemoglobin with 2,2(1)-dithiobispyridine are lower than those of the native form. The reason is that the sulphydryl group is more exposed in the denatured form that in the native form. In addition, there is an increase in the rupturing of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between the CO and NH peptide backbone. There is also a decrease in van der Waals interactions in the denatured form compared to the native for.
e-bound alpha-L-fucosyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of a developmentally regulated carbohydrate antigen, SSEA-1, was purified about 2000-fold from F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. The procedures used were solubilization with Triton X-100, column chromatography on SP-Sephadex, DEAE-Sephadex, RCA-agarose and on GDP-agarose. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, the purified preparation gave a protein band with a relative molecular mass of 65 000. The optimum pH of the enzyme was between 6.0 and 7.0 and the Km toward N-acetyllactosamine was 0.55 mM. The enzyme was active with asialofetuin, but not with intact fetuin. Susceptibility of the product to alpha-L-fucosidase I from almond emulsin verified that the enzyme transferred fucose to C-3 hydroxyl of N-acetylglucosamine in the N-acetyllactosamine structure. Activities of beta-galactoside alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminide alpha 1----4-fucosyltransferase acting on synthetic substrates were not detected in the purified enzyme nor in the crude extract of F9 cells. PYS-2 parietal endoderm cells lacked all the fucosyltransferases mentioned abov.
on between the Gla-domain of coagulation proteins and negatively charged phospholipid membranes is essential for blood coagulation reactions. The interaction is calcium-dependent and mediated both by electrostatic and hydrophobic forces. This report focuses on the electrostatic component of factor IX activation via the extrinsic pathway. Effective charges during the reaction are measured by ionic titration of activity, according to the Debye-Huckel and Gouy-Chapman models. Rates of activation decrease with ionic strength independently of the type of monovalent salt used to control ionic strength. Moreover, the effect of ionic strength decreases at concentrations of charged phospholipid approaching saturation levels, indicating that membrane charges participate directly in the ionic interaction measured. The effective charge on calcium-bound factor IX during activation on phospholipid membranes is 0.95+/-0.1. Possible sites mediating contacts between the Gla-domain and membranes are selected by geometrical criteria in several metal-bound Gla-domain structures. A pocket with a solvent opening-pore of area 24-38 A2 is found in the Gla-domain of factors IX, VII, and prothrombin. The pocket contains atoms with negative partial charges, including carboxylate oxygens from Gla residues, and has a volume of 57-114 A3, sufficient to accommodate additional calcium atoms. These studies demonstrate that electrostatic forces modify the activity coefficient of factor IX during functional interactions and suggest a conserved pocket motif as the contact site between the calcium-bound Gla-domain and charged membrane.
c melanoma represents a&nbsp;significant cause of death in patients with melanoma and the frequency is increasing. The aim of this study was to identify potential therapeutic targets for metastatic melanoma. Gene expression profile GSE44660 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. A&nbsp;total of 22 samples were analyzed in our study, including 3 specimens of normal melanocytes, 12 specimens of melanoma LNM (lymph node metastasis) and 7 specimens of MBM (melanoma brain metastasis). DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in LNM and MBM were identified respectively using Limma package. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways analyses of common DEGs between two comparison groups were performed using DAVID, followed by cancer-related genes and transcription factor analysis. PPI (protein-protein interaction) network was constructed by STRING, and significant key genes were selected. Totally, 401 common DEGs were identified. Disease analysis showed that ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and NBN (nibrin) were related to melanoma. In the PPI network, BIRC5 (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5), BUB1 (BUB1&nbsp;mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase), GMNN (geminin, DNA replication inhibitor), AURKA (aurora kinase A), TOP2A (topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha) and BUB1B (BUB1&nbsp;mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B) were with higher degree more than 50. ICAM1, NBN, BIRC5, BUB1, BUB1B, GMNN, AURKA and TOP2A may play key roles in the progression and development of melanoma. They may be used as specific therapeutic targets in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, further experiments are still needed to confirm our result.
ficult to predict the TP53 status by p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC). We aimed to improve the accuracy of p53 IHC with p53-regulated proteins for predicting the TP53 mutation status. TP53 mutations were detected in 19 of 38 breast cancer patients (50%). Five of 7 cases of protein-truncating mutation of TP53 were completely negative for p53 IHC, whereas 11 of 12 cases of TP53 point mutation were strongly positive for p53 IHC. Therefore, to avoid false negatives, we extracted p53-dependent universally downregulated genes using microarray analysis from 38 breast cancer patients and 2 p53-inducible cell lines. From 9 commonly repressed genes, we evaluated 3 genes, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase (BUB1), which were previously identified as p53-dependent repressed genes. PLK1≥Allred total score (TS) 5 showed the highest correlation with TP53 mutation. To decrease false positivity, we evaluated p21 IHC. Although strong staining of p21 was observed in 4 cases (10.5%), all 4 were wild-type TP53. Thus, p53 mutation-like (p53mt-like) IHC was identified by p53 TS7,8 with PLK1≥TS 5 and p21 TS≤6. p53 mt-like IHC correlated with TP53 mutation (predictive value=0.94). In other 157 breast cancer cases, p53 mt-like was an independent prognostic marker in multivariate analysis and a strong prognostic factor. Stratification with p53 mt-like IHC identified patients with a poorer prognosis. In conclusion, we identified reliable IHC conditions to predict the TP53 status of breast cancer patient.
nt study was undertaken to detect circulating IgG antibodies to peptide antigens derived from baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 isoform 2 (BIRC5) and myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC) in cervical cancer. A total of 107 female patients with cervical cancer of stages I and II, and 130 healthy female subjects were recruited for analysis of circulating IgG antibodies to BIRC5 and MYC. Student's t-test showed significant differences in circulating levels of anti-BIRC5 IgG (t&nbsp;=&nbsp;-4.27, df&nbsp;=&nbsp;235, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.0001) and anti-MYC IgG (t&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.51, df&nbsp;=&nbsp;232, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0005) between the patient group and the control group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.67 with sensitivity of 23.4% against specificity of 90% for the anti-BIRC5 IgG assay and an AUC of 0.66 with sensitivity of 9.4% against specificity of 90.6% for the anti-MYC IgG assay. Analysis of quality control samples gave an inter-assay deviation of 8.9% in the anti-BIRC5 IgG assay and 9.0% in the anti-MYC IgG assay. This work suggests that anti-BIRC5 IgG could serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis of cervical cancer although a panel of such tumor-associated antigens is needed to develop a highly sensitive tes.
igated the role of autophagy, a controlled cellular self-digestion process, in regulating survival of neurons exposed to atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. Olanzapine induced autophagy in human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line, as confirmed by the increase in autophagic flux and presence of autophagic vesicles, fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and increase in the expression of autophagy-related (ATG) genes ATG4B, ATG5, and ATG7. The production of reactive oxygen species, but not modulation of the main autophagy repressor MTOR or its upstream regulators AMP-activated protein kinase and AKT1, was responsible for olanzapine-triggered autophagy. Olanzapine-mediated oxidative stress also induced mitochondrial depolarization and damage, and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria was confirmed by electron microscopy, colocalization of autophagosome-associated MAP1LC3B (LC3B henceforth) and mitochondria, and mitochondrial association with the autophagic cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62. While olanzapine-triggered mitochondrial damage was not overtly toxic to SH-SY5Y cells, their death was readily initiated upon the inhibition of autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors, RNA interference knockdown of BECN1 and LC3B, or biological free radical nitric oxide. The treatment of mice with olanzapine for 14 d increased the brain levels of autophagosome-associated LC3B-II and mRNA encoding Atg4b, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Gabarap, and Becn1. The administration of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly increased the expression of proapoptotic genes (Trp53, Bax, Bak1, Pmaip1, Bcl2l11, Cdkn1a, and Cdkn1b) and DNA fragmentation in the frontal brain region of olanzapine-exposed animals. These data indicate that olanzapine-triggered autophagy protects neurons from otherwise fatal mitochondrial damage, and that inhibition of autophagy might unmask the neurotoxic action of the dru.
d linoleic acid (CLA) isomers can affect the lipid profile and signaling of cells and thereby alter their function. A total of 5,700 bovine oocytes were used in a structured series of experiments to test the effects of CLA cis-9,trans-11 and CLA trans-10,cis-12 in vitro. In experiment 1, high doses of each CLA isomer during in vitro maturation (IVM) were compared with high or low doses during the entire in vitro culture (IVC) of parthenogenetic embryos. High doses of the CLA isomers ranged from 50 to 200 μM and low doses were 15 and 25 μM. In experiment 2, the low doses of each CLA isomer were tested during IVM/IVC on embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF). Experiment 3 compared the effects of 15 μM doses of each CLA isomer during IVM or IVC of IVF embryos. In experiment 4, post-rewarming survival rates and blastomere counts were assessed for embryos supplemented with each CLA isomer during IVM or for 36 h before vitrification. In experiment 1, when either CLA isomer was provided only during IVM, we observed no effects on overall rates of maturation, cleavage, or blastocysts (92.2 ± 1.6%, 78.3 ± 4.1%, and 28.9 ± 5.1%, respectively). However, high doses of each CLA isomer, but not low doses, during the entire embryo culture period decreased blastocyst rates (5-20%) in a dose-dependent manner. Cleavage rates improved with 15 or 50 μM CLA trans-10,cis-12. Progesterone concentrations in maturation media were significantly increased by high doses of each CLA isomer compared with control, but low doses of CLA isomers had no effect. In experiment 2 with IVF embryos, low doses of each CLA isomer did not alter cleavage rates (average 84.9 ± 1.9%) and only 25 μM CLA trans-10,cis-12 during IVC reduced blastocyst rates below those of controls (25.5 ± 2.1 vs. 38.2 ± 2.3%). The lipid content of embryos was increased and relative expression of the BIRC5 (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5) gene was depressed by CLA trans-10,cis-12. In experiment 3, low doses (15μM) of each CLA isomer during IVC significantly reduced blastocyst rates (20.6 ± 2.4% and 27.7 ± 1.2% vs. 34.18 ± 1.2% for CLA trans-10,cis-12 and CLA cis-9,trans-11 compared with control, respectively) with less effect of each CLA during IVM. In experiment 4, adding 100 μM CLA cis-9,trans-11 during the final 36 h of culture resulted in a high survival rate after rewarming and culture, and the higher embryo blastomere count was comparable to that of control embryos not undergoing vitrification. In conclusion, supplementation with either CLA isomer did not improve embryo production, but inclusion of CLA cis-9,trans-11 before vitrification improved the quality of bovine IVF embryos after rewarming and cultur.
oviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5), also known as inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin, is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex and a key player in mitosis. To investigate the function of BIRC5 in liver regeneration, we analyzed a hepatocyte-specific BIRC5-knockout mouse model using a quantitative label-free proteomics approach. Here, we present the analyses of the proteome changes in hepatocyte-specific BIRC5-knockout mice compared to wildtype mice, as well as proteome changes during liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy in wildtype mice and mice lacking hepatic BIRC5, respectively. The BIRC5-knockout mice showed an extensive overexpression of proteins related to cellular maintenance, organization and protein synthesis. Key regulators of cell growth, transcription and translation MTOR and STAT1/STAT2 were found to be overexpressed. During liver regeneration proteome changes representing a response to the mitotic stimulus were detected in wildtype mice. Mainly proteins corresponding to proliferation, cell cycle and cytokinesis were up-regulated. The hepatocyte-specific BIRC5-knockout mice showed impaired liver regeneration, which had severe consequences on the proteome level. However, several proteins with function in mitosis were found to be up-regulated upon the proliferative stimulus. Our results show that the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UHRF1 is strongly up-regulated during liver regeneration independently of BIRC.
ssion of apoptosis genes in a commercial pre-designed low-density array from Applied Biosystems was evaluated in two human brain cancer cell models, LN-18 and Daoy (HTB-186™) in comparison to the reference human primary endothelial cells under basic conditions. Analysis of the gene expression in the cancer cell lines compared to the normal control revealed features reflecting anti-apoptotic and inflammatory characteristics of the former. There was an overall downregulation of apoptosis-stimulating genes in both cancer cell lines, along with an upregulation of certain apoptosis inhibitors. A number of genes demonstrated statistically significant changes in their expressions, including BAX (BCL2-associated X protein); the CARD4/NLR family, CARD domain containing 4; CASP10 (caspase 10, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase); DAP1 (death-associated protein kinase 1), and BIRC5 (baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5). Anti-apoptotic potential in both cell lines was demonstrated by changes in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and downregulation of the APAF1 gene in LN18 cells. There was also significant downregulation of extrinsic signals and the TNF/FADD/inflammatory cascade, and upregulation of caspase inhibitors (IAPs). These results provided a novel molecular characterization of important human cancer cell lines, which might provide a useful research tool for investigating the experimental model of the CNS cel.
expression of Baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5, also called as survivin), a novel member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, has implications in many types of cancer and is considered as a new therapeutic target. We suppose that genetic variant rs9904341 in the 5' UTR region of survivin gene may be associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) in Chinese populatio.
say method was used to genotype the polymorphism in the hospital-based case-control analysis of 665 patients with PCa and 710 age-matched cancer-free controls. The genetic associations with the occurrence and progression of PCa were calculated by logistic regressio.
ts indicated that compared with GG genotypes, there was a statistically significant increased risk of PCa associated with those with CC genotypes [odds ratios (ORs) = 1.57, 95%confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.17-2.13, P = 0.004]. Moreover, stratification analysis revealed that the association was more pronounced in subgroups of nondrinkers, nonsmokers and those without a family history of cancer (all P &lt; 0.05). In addition, we observed that PSA ≥ 20 was more frequent in patients carrying GC/CC genotypes than in those with a wild type genotyp.
ional survivin rs9904341 genetic variant may have a substantial influence on the PCa susceptibility and evolutio.
 is a key mechanism for enhanced cellular radiosensitivity in radiation therapy. Studies suggest that Akt signaling may play a role in apoptosis and radioresistance. This study evaluates the possible modulating role of amiloride, an antihypertensive agent with a modulating effect to alternative splicing for regulating apoptosis, in the antiproliferative effects induced by ionizing radiation (IR) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 8401 cells. Analysis of cell viability showed that amiloride treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation in irradiated GBM8401 cells (p&lt;0.05) in a time-dependent manner, especially in cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment. In comparison with GBM8401 cells treated with amiloride alone, with GBM8401 cells treated with IR alone, and with human embryonic lung fibroblast control cells (HEL 299), GBM8401 cells treated with IR combined with amiloride showed increased overexpression of phosphorylated Akt, regardless of whether IR treatment was performed before or after amiloride administration. The alternative splicing pattern of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (APAF1) in cells treated with amiloride alone, IR alone, and combined amiloride-IR treatments showed more consistent cell proliferation compared to that in other apoptosis-related genes such as baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5), Bcl-X, and homeodomain interacting protein kinase-3 (HIPK3). In GBM8401 cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment, the ratio of prosurvival (-XL,-LC) to proapoptotic (-LN,-S) splice variants of APAF1 was lower than that seen in cells treated with amiloride with IR pretreatment, suggesting that proapoptotic splice variants of APAF1 (APAF1-LN,-S) were higher in the glioblastoma cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment, as compared to glioblastoma cells and fibroblast control cells that had received other treatments. Together, these results suggest that amiloride modulates cell radiosensitivity involving the Akt phosphorylation and the alternative splicing of APAF1, especially for the cells treated with amiloride with IR post-treatment. Therefore, amiloride may improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy for GBM.
isms in 3' untranslated region (UTR) of cancer-related genes might affect their regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) and thereby contribute to carcinogenesis. In this study, we screened single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3' UTR of cancer-related genes and investigated their effects on risk of lung cancer. First, we genotyped seven SNPs in a Chinese Han population with 600 lung cancer patients and 600 matched healthy controls and found that compared with the TT genotype of rs2239680 in 3' UTR of baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5), C allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of lung cancer and advanced pathologic stage, with the odds ratio for participants carrying the CT or CC genotype being 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.89, P&lt;0.01] and 2.29 (95% CI 1.64-3.18, P&lt;0.01), respectively. These results were further replicated and confirmed in another independent population with 1000 lung cancer cases and 1000 matched healthy controls. In support of the postulation that the 3' UTR SNP may directly affect miRNA-binding site, reporter gene assays indicated BIRC5 was a direct target of miR-335, and the rs2239680 T&gt;C change resulted in altered regulation of BIRC5 expression. Moreover, BIRC5 was over expressed in lung cancer tissues compared with the normal lung tissues, and the protein levels of BIRC5 correlated with SNP genotypes in normal lung tissues. Our findings defined a 3' UTR SNP in human BIRC5 oncogene that may increase individual susceptibility to lung cancer probably by attenuating the interaction between miR-335 and BIRC.
y was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-203 (miR-203) on cell proliferation and migration in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC.
 PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-203 in TNBC cell lines. miR-203 precursor and control microRNA (miRNA) were transfected into triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and the effects of miR-203 up-regulation on the proliferation and migration of cells were investigated. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein levels of baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5) and Lim and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) were measured. Luciferase assays were also performed to validate BIRC5 and LASP1 as miR-203 target.
203 and BIRC5 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell proliferation in TNBC cells. Both miR-203 and LASP1 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell migration in TNBC cells, also. Moreover, up-regulated of BIRC5 and LASP1 was able to abrogate the effects induced by transfection with the miR-203 precurso.
a suggest that miR-203 may function as a tumor suppressor in TNBC cells. Thus, miR-203 could be a potential therapeutic target for this diseas.
st few years, it has been recognized that the unbalanced regulation of survival and apoptosis of bronchial inflammatory cells is a key component in the development of asthma. Baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5) (also known as survivin) is an important anti-apoptotic protein that has been implicated in many cancer types, and recent studies provide evidence for its role in controlling inflammatory disorders as well. Our aim was to investigate at both genetic and transcriptional levels if BIRC5 has an impact on asthma development. We found that induced sputum samples of patients with bronchial asthma contained elevated levels of BIRC5 mRNA compared with healthy subjects and its level was in correlation with sputum eosinophil percentages. Furthermore, in a case-control study examining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BIRC5 regulatory regions, the minor alleles of rs8073903 and rs8073069 were found to be significantly associated with asthma and especially non-allergic asthma phenotypes, which associations were more prominent among women. Two marker haplotype analyses further strengthen the impact of these two polymorphisms on both asthma and non-allergic asthma. In the female cohort, rs1508147 was also significantly associated with increased risk of non-allergic asthma. Additionally, with linear regression analysis, we showed that rs9904341 was significantly correlated with both absolute and relative serum eosinophil levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that possibly by inhibition of the eosinophil apoptosis, BIRC5 might be an important regulator of the asthmatic processes and we provide some evidence that its effect might be affected by SNPs located in the gene regulatory region.
a common feature of solid tumors, plays a significant role in determining tumor phenotype and tumor progression. In this study, using an in-house PCR-array, we investigated phenotypic changes and differentially expressed hypoxia related genes in the KKU-M213 CCA cell line, cultured under hypoxic (1% O2) condition. Trefoil factor-1 (TFF1), a disintegrin, and metalloprotease 12 (ADAM12), integrin-alpha 5 (ITGA5) and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5/survivin), proteins involved with cell proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis resistance, were up-regulated whereas uridine 5'-monophosphate synthase (UMPS) and S100 calcium binding protein P (S100P), involved with chemosensitivity and cell adhesion, were down-regulated. Growth arrest, apoptosis resistance to UV-irradiation and chemotherapeutic drugs (5- flourouracil, cisplatin, doxorubicin) as well as cell adhesion were thus significantly enhanced upon exposure to hypoxic condition. These findings emphasize the significance of a hypoxic state in the induction of an aggressive phenotype and suggest the potential of targeting hypoxia regulated genes to enhance the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drug against CC.
rial transcription factor A (mtTFA) is one of the high mobility group protein family and is required for both transcription from and maintenance of mitochondrial genomes. However, the roles of mtTFA have not been extensively studied in cancer cells. Here, we firstly reported the nuclear localization of mtTFA. The proportion of nuclear-localized mtTFA varied among different cancer cells. Some mtTFA binds tightly to the nuclear chromatin. DNA microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that mtTFA can regulate the expression of nuclear genes. Overexpression of mtTFA enhanced the growth of cancer cell lines, whereas downregulation of mtTFA inhibited their growth by regulating mtTFA target genes, such as baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5; also known as survivin). Knockdown of mtTFA expression induced p21-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. These results imply that mtTFA functions in both nuclei and mitochondria to promote cell growt.
al inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5, also called as survivin) is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, which plays an important role in the occurrence and progression of cancer. Recently, a polymorphism in the promoter of BIRC5, -31C/G (rs9904341), was shown to influence BIRC5 expressio.
ed whether the -31C/G was related to the risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a case-control population from Guangxi province in southern China, which consists of 855 patients with NPC and 1036 controls. This polymorphism was genotyped by TaqMan assay. The genetic associations with the occurrence and progression of NPC were estimated by logistic regressio.
ed a statistically significant increased occurrence of NPC associated with the CC genotype (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.73; P=0.0020) compared with the genotypes containing G allele (CG + GG genotype). However, no significant association was observed for the -31C/G with the severity of NPC (as measured by tumor-node-metastasis staging system.
ngs suggest that the functional polymorphism -31C/G in the promoter of BIRC5 gene may play a role in mediating the susceptibility to NPC among Chines.
induces the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the arrestin, β1 (ARRB1) protein. However, whether ARRB1 translocates to the nucleus upon nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation and how it regulates growth of human NSCLCs are not know.
igated nuclear localization of ARRB1 in human NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H1650), normal lung cell lines (NHBE and SAEC), and lung cancer tissue microarray. A549 cells were transfected with ARRB1-specific short hairpin RNA (A549-sh) to knockdown ARRB1 expression, or with empty vector (A549-EV), to examine the role of ARRB1 in the mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects of nicotine, binding of ARRB1 to E2F transcription factors, and the role of ARRB1 in nicotine-induced expression of E2F-regulated survival and proliferative genes cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6), thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for quantitative analysis of mRNA expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed on A549 cells and fresh-frozen human NSCLC tumors (n = 8) to examine the binding of ARRB1, E1A binding protein (EP300), and acetylated histone 3 (Ac-H3) on the E2F-regulated genes. All statistical tests were two-side.
induced the nuclear translocation of ARRB1 in NSCLC and normal lung cells, and lung tumor tissues from smokers showed an increased nuclear localization. The mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects of nicotine were reduced in A549-sh cells. Nuclear ARRB1 bound to E2F transcription factors in normal lung cells, NSCLC cells, and tumors. Nicotine treatment induced a statistically significant increased expression of E2F-regulated genes in A549-EV but not in A549-sh cells; the maximum difference being observed in BIRC5 (A549-EV vs A549-sh, mean fold-increase in mRNA level upon nicotine treatment = 20.7-fold, 95% confidence interval = 19.2- to 22.2-fold, vs mean = 0.8-fold, 95% confidence interval= 0.78- to 0.82-fold, P &lt; .001). Furthermore, nicotine induced the binding of ARRB1, EP300, and Ac-H3 on E2F-regulated gene.
induced the nuclear translocation of ARRB1 and showed increased expression of proliferative and survival genes, thereby contributing to the growth and progression of NSCLC.
mediated Annealing, extension, Selection and Ligation (DASL) assay has become a suitable gene expression profiling system for degraded RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue. We examined assay characteristics and the performance of the DASL 502-gene Cancer Panel v1 (1.5K) and 24,526-gene panel (24K) platforms at differentiating nine human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- positive (HER2+) and 11 HER2-negative (HER2-) paraffin-embedded breast tumor.
man plots and Spearman correlations evaluated intra/inter-panel agreement of normalized expression values. Unequal-variance t-statistics tested for differences in expression levels between HER2 + and HER2 - tumors. Regulatory network analysis was performed using Metacore (GeneGo Inc., St. Joseph, MI.
 replicate correlations ranged between 0.815-0.956 and 0.986-0.997 for the 1.5K and 24K panels, respectively. Inter-panel correlations of expression values for the common 498 genes across the two panels ranged between 0.485-0.573. Inter-panel correlations of expression values of 17 probes with base-pair sequence matches between the 1.5K and 24K panels ranged between 0.652-0.899. In both panels, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) was the most differentially expressed gene between the HER2 + and HER2 - tumors and seven additional genes had p-values &lt; 0.05 and log2 -fold changes &gt; |0.5| in expression between HER2 + and HER2 - tumors: topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), cyclin a2 (CCNA2), v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 5a (WNT5A), growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7), cell division cycle 2 (CDC2), and baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5). The top 52 discriminating probes from the 24K panel are enriched with genes belonging to the regulatory networks centered around v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and estrogen receptor α (ESR1). Network analysis with a two-step extension also showed that the eight discriminating genes common to the 1.5K and 24K panels are functionally linked together through MYC, TP53, and ESR.
ive RNA abundance obtained from two highly differing density gene panels are correlated with eight common genes differentiating HER2 + and HER2 - breast tumors. Network analyses demonstrated biological consistency between the 1.5K and 24K gene panel.
an increasing need for the identification of both DNA and RNA biomarkers from pathodiagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples for the exploration of individualized therapy strategies in cancer. We investigated a fully automated, xylene-free nucleic acid extraction method for the simultaneous analysis of RNA and DNA biomarkers related to breast cance.
fied both RNA and DNA from a single 10-μm section of 210 paired samples of FFPE tumor and adjacent normal tissues (1-25 years of archival time) using a fully automated extraction method. Half of the eluate was DNase I digested for mRNA expression analysis performed by using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR for the genes estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian) (ERBB2), epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha 170kDa (TOP2A). The remaining undigested aliquot was used for the analysis of 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometr.
 210 samples (99.0%) the protocol yielded robust quantification-cycle values for both RNA and DNA normalization. Expression of the 8 breast cancer genes was detected in 81%-100% of tumor tissues and 21%-100% of normal tissues. The 7 SNPs were successfully genotyped in 91%-97% of tumor and 94%-97% of normal tissues. Allele concordance between tumor and normal tissue was 98.9%-99.5.
y automated process allowed an efficient simultaneous extraction of both RNA and DNA from a single FFPE section and subsequent dual analysis of selected genes. High gene expression and genotyping detection rates demonstrate the feasibility of molecular profiling from limited archival patient sample.
l cancer has provided an important model to test the stem cell hypothesis of cancer origin, which implies that cancer arises as a result of genetic aberrations in stem cells leading to deregulation of the proliferation/differentiation balance. We and others have demonstrated that, similarly to other solid tumors, colon carcinogenesis and progression are dictated by highly apoptosis-resistant stem-like cells. Our data have suggested that protection from apoptosis is achieved by autocrine production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) through up-regulation of anti-apoptotic mediators. In this study, we extend our analysis to another apoptosis inhibitor widely expressed in tumors, namely survivin (also known as BIRC-5, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5). We show that this protein, with important roles in cell death counteraction and mitotic progression control, is regulated by the IL-4 pathway in colon rectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSC). Hence, the presence of IL-4 increases survivin levels in our model while cytokine neutralization has opposing effects. Treatment with cytokine neutralizing agent or with leflunomide, Stat6 inhibitor, have similar consequences on survivin localization, increasing its nuclear pool, an observation known to be correlated with a good prognosis in colon cancer patients. These results demonstrate that IL-4, through activation of the STAT-6 signaling pathway, is involved in survivin expression levels as well as its localization. These findings shed more light on the molecular mechanisms involved in IL-4-mediated chemoresistanc.
 peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare and highly aggressive soft tissue tumors showing complex chromosomal aberrations. In order to identify recurrent chromosomal regions of gain and loss, and thereby novel gene targets of potential importance for MPNST development and/or progression, we have analyzed DNA copy number changes in seven high-grade MPNSTs using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH.
ble more gains than losses were observed, and the most frequent minimal recurrent regions of gain included 1q24.1-q24.2, 1q24.3-q25.1, 8p23.1-p12, 9q34.11-q34.13 and 17q23.2-q25.3, all gained in five of seven samples. The 17q23.2-q25.3 region was gained in all five patients with poor outcome and not in the two patients with disease-free survival. cDNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR were used to investigate expression of genes located within these regions. The gene lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) was identified as a candidate target for the 8p23.1-p12 gain. Within 17q, the genes topoisomerase II-alpha (TOP2A), ets variant gene 4 (E1A enhancer binding protein, E1AF) (ETV4) and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (survivin) (BIRC5) showed increased expression in all samples compared to two benign tumors. Increased expression of these genes has previously been associated with poor survival in other malignancies, and for TOP2A, in MPNSTs as well. In addition, we have analyzed the expression of five micro RNAs located within the 17q23.2-q25.3 region, but none of them showed high expression levels compared to the benign tumor.
 shows the potential of using DNA copy number changes obtained by array CGH to predict the prognosis of MPNST patients. Although no clear correlations between the expression level and patient outcome were observed, the genes TOP2A, ETV4 and BIRC5 are interesting candidate targets for the 17q gain associated with poor surviva.
sease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive copper overload disorder caused by mutations in the copper-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) ATP7B. It presents with a highly variable clinical phenotype ranging from asymptomatic to fulminant hepatic failure or progressive neurological involvement. No clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been established. Thus, variants in modifier genes could have an impact on WD manifestation and severity. Recently, the antiapoptotic protein baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 4 BIRC4/XIAP has been suggested as a regulator of copper-induced cell death. With the aim of investigating a putative role of BIRC4/XIAP as modifier gene in individuals with copper overload, we analyzed a WD patient cohort (n = 98) for sequence variants at the BIRC4/XIAP locus. When compared with clinical data, the previously described coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the BRIC4/XIAP locus (rs28382721, rs28382722, rs28382723, rs5956583, rs28382740, rs12838858, rs28382741) did not correlate with age of onset or clinical presentation in our collective. However, three previously unreported variants in the BIRC4/XIAP gene were identified (c.1-26 T &gt; G; c.1408A &gt; T; p.T470S; c.1019A &gt; G; p.N340S). The two patients with variants leading to amino acid exchanges in the BIRC4/XIAP protein showed a remarkably early disease onset at the age of 5 years. Furthermore, one of these patients was only heterozygous for disease-causing mutations in the ATP7B gene. In summary, these data emphasize the need to further elucidate a role of BIRC4/XIAP variants as putative pathogenetic factors in copper overload disorder.
f 4 additional splice variants (survivin-DeltaEx3, survivin 2alpha, survivin-2B, and survivin-3B) have been described for survivin [baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein (BIRC-5), approved gene symbol BIRC5], which has been implicated in both inhibition of apoptosis and regulation in mitosis in many tumor types. In this study, we assessed whether the survivin splice variants modulate or add to the prognostic value of total survivin in breast cance.
titative reverse transcription-PCR, we measured mRNA concentrations of survivin and all variants in tumor tissue from 275 patients with breast cancer and associated these with clinicopathologic characteristics and relapse-free surviva.
vivin, survivin-DeltaEx3, and survivin 2alpha mRNA levels were associated with young age and ductal histology. Total survivin and survivin-DeltaEx3 were highest in samples with advanced histological grade, whereas patients with 4-9 involved lymph nodes expressed less survivin-2B mRNA than those with 1-3 involved nodes. All variants were higher in tumors negative for steroid hormone receptors. Total survivin, survivin 2alpha, and survivin-3B were associated with poor relapse-free survival in univariate analyses. Survivin 2alpha and survivin-3B added to the prognostic value of total survivin in multivariate analyses. In addition, the prognostic value of total survivin was evident only in the presence of higher expression levels of these 2 variant.
nts of survivin exhibited particular associations with clinicopathologic characteristics (age, histology, grade, and steroid hormone receptor status) of breast cancer patients. Survival analyses suggest a modulating role of survivin 2alpha and survivin-3B on the biological function of total survivi.
studies have suggested that amplification of genes, notably the TOP2A gene, on chromosome arm 17q may be important for the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST). In order to study the frequency, distribution, and chromosomal organization of rearrangements at 17q, interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to evaluate copy number changes at 17q in 28 MPNSTs. Increased copy numbers were seen for the ERBB2 and TOP2A genes in eight and nine cases, respectively, supporting a potential role for these two genes in MPNST tumourigenesis. Net gain of distal 17q material was observed in 16 of the 28 MPNSTs, with high-level gain in three cases, and was associated with poor outcome. Among the 26 patients for whom follow-up data were available, gain of distal 17q was present in 11 of 12 tumours that had metastasized, compared with 4 of 14 of those that had not metastasized. Detailed FISH mapping analysis of metaphase spreads identified a 2 Mb commonly gained/amplified region at 17q25. Among the genes mapping to this region, BIRC5, which encodes the baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5/survivin protein, is a strong candidate target gene for amplification, as it has been previously shown to be overexpressed in neurofibromatosis type 1-associated MPNST. Three other genes that co-amplified with BIRC5 represent other potential candidate genes: PTDSR involved in apoptosis; SEPT9 overexpressed in human malignant brain tumours; and SOCS3 involved in cell survival and differentiation of neuron.
apy represents an attractive approach for the treatment of eye diseases such as glaucoma. Ocular administration of viral vectors produces localized retinal gene expression with reduced risks of side effects reported with systemic administration of viral vectors. Recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have proven effective in producing long-term retinal gene expression, due to stable integration of DNA into the genome and lack of host immune response to the virus. Recently developed AAV constructs using the chicken beta-actin (CBA) promoter drive highly efficient transgene expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), photoreceptors, and pigment epithelium. Rats were given unilateral intravitreal injections of AAV-CBA vector coding for human baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein-4 (BIRC4), a potent caspase inhibitor. Ocular hypertension was induced in the same eye by sclerosis of aqueous humor outflow channels. After chronic exposure to elevated intraocular pressure, we performed optic nerve axon counts to determine the neuroprotective effects of retinal BIRC4 expression, and compared axon survival with vector and balanced salt solution control groups. Gene therapy delivering BIRC4 significantly promoted optic nerve axon survival in a chronic ocular hypertensive model of rat glaucoma. Blocking RGC apoptosis with caspase inhibitors represents a promising approach for treatment of human glaucom.
igated the synergistic effect of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor plus radiation therapy, on the proliferation and survival of gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.&nbsp;We also studied several genes involved in the simvastatin/radiation-induced effect.
ancer (AGS, SNU601, MKN1, and MKN28) and CRC (CoLo320, SW48, HT29, and HCT8) cell lines were treated with 0.2&nbsp;μM simvastatin alone, or in combination with 0 to 4&nbsp;Gy of radiation, and subjected to clonogenic survival and proliferation assays in&nbsp;vitro. To assess the molecular mechanism of the combination treatment, we performed microarray analysis, immunoblot assays, small interfering RNA knockdown experiments, and plasmid rescue assays. The antitumoral effects of simvastatin and radiation were evaluated in&nbsp;vivo using xenograft model.
nation therapy of simvastatin plus radiation inhibited basal clonogenic survival and proliferation of GC and CRC cells in&nbsp;vitro. Simvastatin suppressed the expression of BIRC5 and CTGF genes in these cancer cells. In&nbsp;vivo, the combined treatment with simvastatin and radiation significantly reduced the growth of xenograft tumors compared with treatment with radiation alon.
t that simvastatin has a synergistic effect with radiation on GC and CRC through the induction of apoptosis, which may be mediated by a simultaneous inhibition of BIRC5 and CTGF expression. A clinical trial of simvastatin in combination with radiation in patients with GC or CRC is warrante.
tive of the present study was to explore the expression and significance of survivin and Livin in lesions of Condyloma acuminatum (CA). Streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) immunohistochemistry method was used to measure the expression of survivin, Livin and Ki-67 in 48 cases of CA and 25 cases of normal foreskin tissues. The positive expression rates of survivin, Livin and Ki-67 were 72.91% (35/48), 77.08% (37/48) and 85.42% (41/48) in CA tissues, and 4% (1/25), 4% (5/25) and 60% (15/25) in the control group, respectively. The expression intensity of survivin, Livin and Ki-67 in CA tissues (++ ~ +++) was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (- ~ ++). There were significant differences (P &lt;0.05) both in the positive rates and the expression intensity of survivin, Livin and Ki-67 between the two groups. There was positive correlation between the expression of survivin and Livin in CA group (P &lt; 0.01); the expressions of survivin and Ki-67 were positively correlated with each other (P &lt; 0.01); Livin and Ki-67 expressions were positively correlated with each other (P &lt; 0.01). There were over-expressions and excessive proliferations of survivin and Livin in CA tissues, and apoptosis suppressors survivin and Livin were correlated with C.
and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) levels are elevated in prostate cancer (PCa) compared to normal prostate glands. However, the relationship between survivin and MAOA in PCa is unclea.
ed MAOA expression in the prostate lobes of a conditional PTEN-deficient mouse model mirroring human PCa, with or without survivin knockout. We also silenced one gene at a time and examined the expression of the other. We further evaluated the combination of MAOA inhibitors and survivin suppressants on the growth, viability, migration and invasion of PCa cell.
and MAOA levels are both increased in clinical PCa tissues and significantly associated with patients' survival. Survivin depletion delayed MAOA increase during PCa progression, and silencing MAOA decreased survivin expression. The combination of MAOA inhibitors and the survivin suppressants (YM155 and SC144) showed significant synergy on the inhibition of PCa cell growth, migration and invasion with concomitant decrease in survivin and MMP-9 level.
a positive feedback loop between survivin and MAOA expression in PCa. Considering that survivin suppressants and MAOA inhibitors are currently available in clinical trials and clinical use, their synergistic effects in PCa support a rapid translation of this combination to clinical practic.
idence exists regarding a relationship between survivin expression and prognosis in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We investigated the relationship between survivin expression, clinical characteristics and prognosis in SCLC patient.
pectively reviewed medical records of study patients and analyzed their tumor sections using nuclear survivin labeling index (LI.
cant correlation between nuclear survivin LI and clinical stage was found (p=0.012). In multivariate analysis, a significant association was found between survival and clinical stage (hazard ratio (HR)=2.09; 95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.08-4.31; p=0.027) but not between survival and nuclear survivin LI (HR=0.96; 95 % CI=0.91-1.02; p=0.2.
t find any positive relationship between nuclear survivin expression and survival in SCLC patients. Conversely, we found a positive relationship between clinical stage and nuclear survivin LI, which is considered to be useful in deciding treatment strategie.
ular endothelial cells cultured in three-dimensional hydrogel scaffolds form a network of microvessel structures when implanted subcutaneously in mice, inosculate with host vessels, and over time remodel into large ectatic vascular structures resembling hemangiomas. When compared with infantile hemangiomas, similarities were noted, including a temporal progression from a morphological appearance of a proliferative phase to the appearance of an involuted phase, mimicking the proliferative and involutional phases of infantile hemangioma. Consistent with the progression of a proliferative phase to an involuted phase, both the murine implants and human biopsy tissue exhibit reduced expression of Ajuba, YAP, and Survivin labeling as they progressed over time. Significant numbers of CD45+, CD11b+, Mac3+ mononuclear cells were found at the 2-week time point in our implant model that correlated with the presence of CD45+, CD68+ mononuclear cells observed in biopsies of human proliferative-phase hemangiomas. At the 4-week time point in our implant model, only small numbers of CD45+ cells were detected, which again correlated with our findings of significantly diminished CD45+, CD68+ mononuclear cells in human involutional-phase hemangiomas. The demonstration of mononuclear cell infiltration transiently in the proliferative phase of these lesions suggests that the vascular proliferation and/or regression may be driven in part by an immune response. Gross and microscopic morphological appearances of human proliferative and involutional hemangiomas and our implant model correlate well with each other as do the expression levels of Hippo pathway components (Ajuba and YAP) and Survivin and correlate with proliferation in these entities. Inhibitors of Survivin and Ajuba (which we have demonstrated to inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in murine hemangioendothelioma cell tissue culture) may have potential as other beneficial treatments for proliferating infantile hemangiomas. This implant model may have potential as a modest through-put screen for testing and development of therapeutics targeted at the proliferative phase of infantile hemangiomas, reducing the subsequent postinvolutional scarring or deformities sometimes associated with these lesion.
is an oncofetal protein involved both in inhibiting of apoptosis and in cell cycle regulation. The functions of survivin are defined by its structural state. Due to nature polymorphism, survivin cancontain either E or K amino acid in 129 residue, and K129 is commonly acetylated. Only the protein having acetylated K129 tends to form dimeric structure. Thus, antibodies detecting the amino acid substitution can be a useful tool for structural and functional research of the protein. To obtain the antibodies specific to amino acid substitution E129/K129 peptide fragments overlapping 129 amino acid residue were synthesized, rabbits were immunized with the peptides and affinity purification of the antibodies on sepharose conjugated with the peptides was carried out. The data of ELISA and western blot showed that antibodies obtained were able to detect amino acid substitution E129/K129 in the recombinant and endogenous survivi.
geting receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 are of particular interest since activating FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations abundantly occur in fatal acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Imidazoacridinone C-1311, a DNA-reactive inhibitor of topoisomerase II, has been previously shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of recombinant FLT3. Here, we expand those findings by studying its effect on leukemia cells with wild-type FLT3, FLT3-ITD mutant and no FLT3 receptor. While brief C-1311 exposure blocked wild-type and FLT3-ITD activity, profound and sustained inhibition was achieved only for FLT3-ITD mutants. C-1311 inhibited FLT3 downstream pathways (MAPK and AKT) independent of FLT3 status, yet translation to decreased viability was significant in FLT3-ITD cells. RNA interference against FLT3-ITD reduced cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induced by C-1311, indicating selective inhibition of FLT3-ITD crucial for high efficacy of drug against activated leukemia cells. Cellular responses in treated FLT3-ITD mutants included G1 and G2/M phase arrest, moderate inhibition of Bcl-2, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and depolarization of mitochondria. Consistent with selective decrease in FLT3-ITD activity, C-1311 remarkably reduced antiapoptotic survivin mRNA and protein expression, correlating well with enhanced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD cells. No survivin decrease and respectively lower level of apoptosis was found in wild-type and null-FLT3 cells. Combination of C-1311 with cytarabine or doxorubicin again showed distinct synergistic activity in FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The ability of C-1311 to selectively target constitutively active FLT3, suggests a favorable therapeutic index for AML carrying FLT3-ITD mutations. Thus further preclinical and clinical studies addressing its potency against FLT3-ITD kinase is well justifie.
igate survivin, AKT and VEGF expression in primary mucosal oral melanoma and explore their correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosi.
lignant primary oral melanomas were immunostained with antibodies against survivin, AKT, VEGF, CD34. Histological parameters and disease-specific survival were related to marker expression.
localization was both nuclear and cytoplasmic with a higher expression of nuclear survivin. High melanocyte survivin expression significantly correlated with higher thickness of primary melanoma. A significant positive correlation was found between melanocyte survivin and phospho Akt and VEGF expression. Survivin was significantly associated with the presence of metastasis. High melanocyte survivin and high endothelial VEGF expression were inversely correlated to both overall and disease-specific 5-year surviva.
 via AKT and VEGF, seems to play an important role in oral melanoma and could represent an important prognostic marker of melanoma progressio.
k protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone involved in the stability of many client proteins, including androgen receptor (AR) and survivin, making Hsp90 an attractive molecular therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Several Hsp90 inhibitors have shown antitumor activity in various preclinical models and in clinical trials. Geldanamycin is a well-known inhibitor of Hsp90, but its associated liver toxicity limited its clinical development. Here, we report a highly effective and low-hepatotoxic geldanamycin derivative that exhibits antitumor activity against human prostate cancer cells. Treatment of cells with 17-DMCHAG (17-(6-(3,4-dimethoxycinnamamido)hexylamino)-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin) dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation, reduced colony formation and induced apoptosis of human prostate cancer cell lines. 17-DMCHAG exhibits anti-invasive and anti-migratory activities in prostate cancer cells through down-regulating of transcription factors Zeb1, Snail1, Slug, and mesenchymal marker Vimentin, while up-regulating the epithelial marker of E-cadherin. Furthermore, 17-DMCHAG treatment damaged the Hsp90/AR and Hsp90/survivin complexes and induced the proteasome-dependent degradation of AR and survivin, then inhibited the activity of these two proteins. In vivo, we observed that 17-DMCHAG showed strong antitumor effects in LNCaP and DU-145 cell-xenografted nude mice. Thus, 17-DMCHAG is a potential treatment for prostate cance.
n-mediated radio-adaptive response was induced in SA-NH murine sarcoma cells following activation of nuclear transcription factor κB (NFκB) by very low doses of ionizing radiation of 5, 20 or 100 mGy. SA-NH cells and a clone stably transfected with a plasmid containing a mutated IκBα gene that prevents the activation of NFκB (SA-NH+mIκBα1) were used to investigate the role of NFκB activation in the development and expression of the survivin-mediated radio-adaptive response. Tumor cells were exposed to very low doses of radiation 30 min prior to or at times ranging from 30 min to 6 h after the first of two 2 Gy doses separated by 24 h under in vitro conditions. Evidence of very low dose radiation induced a radio-adaptive response only in SA-NH but not SA-NH+mIκBα1 cells was shown by both an increase in SA-NH cell survival of 20-40% using a standard colony forming assay and reduced apoptosis frequencies of 20-40% as determined by the TUNEL assay. Changes in survivin protein levels as a function of irradiation conditions were monitored by Western blot. A 100 mGy exposure 30 min prior to a 2 Gy dose resulted in an elevation in total survivin protein 24 h later in SA-NH but not SA-NH+mIκBα1 cells. Transfection of cells with survivin siRNA inhibited elevation of survivin protein by very low dose radiation and the subsequent radio-adaptive response in SA-NH cells. These data suggest that the survivin-mediated radio-adaptive response is dependent upon the ability of cells to activate NFκ.
sition of anti-cancer drug resistance is a major limitation of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma (MM) and it is thus important to identify the mechanisms by which MM cells develop such drug resistance. In a previous study, we showed that multidrug resistance (MDR) involves the overexpression of MDR1 and survivin in vincristine-resistant RPMI8226/VCR cells. However, the underlying mechanism of MDR remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of MDR in RPMI8226/VCR cells, and found that RPMI8226/VCR cells exhibit increased levels of activated ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-κB, while the levels of activated mTOR, p38MAPK, and JNK do not differ between RPMI8226/VCR cells and their vincristine-susceptible counterparts. In addition, the inhibition of ERK1/2, Akt, or NF-κB by inhibitors reversed the drug-resistance of RPMI8226/VCR cells via the suppression of survivin expression, but did not affect MDR1 expression; RNA silencing of survivin expression completely reversed vincristine resistance, while MDR1 silencing only weakly suppressed vincristine resistance in RPMI8226/VCR cells. These results indicate that enhanced survivin expression via the activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-κB plays a critical role in vincristine resistance in RPMI8226/VCR cells. Our findings suggest that ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-κB inhibitors are potentially useful as anti-MDR agents for the treatment of vincristine-resistant M.
ggressive chemotherapy, approximately one-third of children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) relapse. More effective treatments are urgently needed. Survivin is an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein with key roles in regulating cell division, proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, high expression of Survivin has been associated with poor clinical outcome in AML. The survivin suppressant YM155 (Sepantronium Bromide) has pre-clinical activity against a range of solid cancers and leukemias, although data in AML is limited. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation of YM155 in paediatric AML. YM155 potently inhibited cell viability in a diverse panel of AML cell lines. All paediatric cell lines were particularly sensitive, with a median IC50 of 0.038 μM. Cell cycle analyses demonstrated concentration-dependent increases in a sub-G1 population with YM155 treatment, suggestive of apoptosis that was subsequently confirmed by an increase in annexin-V positivity. YM155-mediated apoptosis was confirmed across a panel of 8 diagnostic bone marrow samples from children with AML. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, YM155 treatment was associated with down-regulation of survivin mRNA and protein expression and induction of DNA damage. These data suggest that YM155-mediated inhibition of survivin is a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for AML, particularly paediatric disease, and warrants further evaluatio.
is a biomarker of cancer known for its anti-apoptotic and cell-cycle regulating properties. In the context of non-cancer pathology, high levels of survivin may be measured in blood and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and associate with early joint damage and poor therapy response. The aim of the study was to investigate the value of survivin measurements in blood for diagnosis of RA in the frame of the Malaysian epidemiological investigation of rheumatoid arthritis (MyEIRA) study. The study enrolled RA patients from eight rheumatology centres in Peninsular Malaysia. The healthy controls matched by age, gender and ethnicity were recruited on the community basis from the residential area of the patients. Levels of survivin were measured in blood of RA patients (n = 1233) and controls (n = 1566) by an enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). The risk for RA was calculated as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals in the individuals with high levels of survivin. The risk was calculated in relation to antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (ACPA), detected by ELISA and HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles, identified by the polymerase chain reaction using sequence specific oligonucleotide method. High levels of survivin were detected in 625 of 1233 (50.7%) RA cases and in 85 of 1566 (5.4%) controls, indicating its high specificity for RA. Survivin was association with an increase in RA risk in the patients having neither SE-alleles nor ACPA (OR = 5.40, 95% CI 3.81-7.66). For the patients combining survivin, SE, and ACPA, the estimated risk for RA was 16-folds higher compared to the survivin negative patients with SE and ACPA(OR = 16.21, 95% CI 5.70-46.18). To conclude, detection of survivin in blood provides a simple test to improve diagnostic and to increase predictability for R.
ansducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively activated in human cancers. Therefore, STAT3 is a therapeutic target of cancer drug discovery. We previously reported that natural products inhibited constitutively activated STAT3 in human prostate tumor cells. We used a dual-luciferase assay to screen 200 natural products isolated from herbal medicines and we identified ginkgetin obtained from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba L. as a STAT3 inhibitor. Ginkgetin inhibited both inducible and constitutively activated STAT3 and blocked the nuclear translocation of p-STAT3 in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, ginkgetin selectively inhibited the growth of prostate tumor cells stimulated with activated STAT3. Ginkgetin induced STAT3 dephosphorylation at Try705 and inhibited its localization to the nucleus, leading to the inhibition of expression of STAT3 target genes such as cell survival-related genes (cyclin D1 and survivin) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL). Therefore, ginkgetin inhibited the growth of STAT3-activated tumor cells. We also found that ginkgetin inhibited tumor growth in xenografted nude mice and downregulated p-STAT3(Tyr705) and survivin in tumor tissues. This is the first report that ginkgetin exerts antitumor activity by inhibiting STAT3. Therefore, ginkgetin is a good STAT3 inhibitor and may be a useful lead molecule for development of a therapeutic STAT3 inhibito.
pindle protein (KSP) plays a critical role in mitosis. Inhibition of KSP function leads to cell cycle arrest at mitosis and ultimately to cell death. The aim of this study was to suppress KSP expression by specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in Hep3B cells and evaluate its anti-tumor activit.
NA targeting KSP (KSP-siRNA #1-3) and one mismatched-siRNA (Cont-siRNA) were transfected into cells. Subsequently, KSP mRNA and protein levels, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were examined in both Hep3B cells and THLE-3 cells. In addition, the chemosensitivity of KSP-siRNA-treated Hep3B cells with doxorubicin was also investigated using cell proliferation and clonogenic survival assay.
ssion of endogenous KSP at both mRNA and protein levels in Hep3B cells was higher than in THLE-3 cells. In Hep3B cells, KSP-siRNA #2 showed a further downregulation of KSP as compared to KSP-siRNA #1 or KSP-siRNA #3. It also exhibited greater suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis than KSP-siRNA #1 or KSP-siRNA #3; this could be explained by the significant downregulation of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin. In contrast, KSP-siRNAs had no or lower effects on KSP expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis in THLE-3 cells. We also noticed that KSP-siRNA transfection could increase chemosensitivity to doxorubicin in Hep3B cells, even at low doses compared to contro.
the expression level of KSP, combined with drug treatment, yields promising results for eradicating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro. This study opens a new direction for liver cancer treatmen.
f this case-control study was to identify clinicopathological factors and test three relevant biomarkers for their ability to predict early intrahepatic recurrence after curative liver resection for colorectal liver metastases (CLM.
4 patients with CLM undergoing hepatectomy between January 2007 and December 2009, thirty patients had intrahepatic disease recurrence within 6 months. The control group was randomly selected from a cohort of patients between April 1997 and December 2005 who have survived without disease recurrence after CLM resection for over 5 years. Both groups were matched for size of metastasis greater than 5.0 cm, the presence of multiple metastases, and synchronous versus metachronous CLM. The final study population consisted of 60 patients with CLM undergoing R0 hepatectomy, 30 of whom had early intrahepatic-only recurrences (study group) and 30 patients without recurrence for more than 5 years (control group). Both groups were analyzed and compared for the presence of clinical factors and expression levels of CD133, survivin, and Bcl-2 within tumor tissu.
istics of patients were similar between the two groups except primary tumor location and administration of postoperative chemotherapy. Expression level of CD133 and survivin were significantly increased in tumors of patients with recurrence compared to patients without recurrence. On multivariate analysis high tumor expression levels of CD133 (odds ratio [OR] 14.7, confidence interval [CI] 1.8-121.3, p = 0.012) and survivin (OR 9.5, CI 2.1-44.3, p = 0.004) and postoperative chemotherapy (OR 4.8, CI 1.01-22.9, p = 0.049) were independent factors associated with early intrahepatic recurrenc.
ression levels of CD133 and survivin may be a useful predictor of early intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy for CLM. Administration of postoperative chemotherapy may prevent early intrahepatic recurrenc.
c cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system. It is the fourth major cause of tumor-related death and its morbidity is increasing, and hence it is imperative to develop effective forms of therapy for pancreatic cancer. Peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) is an important gastrointestinal peptide hormone. According to previous literatures, PYY has been shown to inhibit tumor proliferation in cellular and animal models, but there has been limited research on the detailed mechanism of PYY in pancreatic cancer. This study was to observe the effects of PYY on pancreatic cancer cell and investigate the possible mechanis.
ssion of Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors on pancreatic cancer cell lines were detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The cytotoxicity of PYY toward the MiaPaCa-2 cell was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; the cell morphology and structure changes were observed under inverted microscope and transmission electron microscope respectively. Apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. The activity of caspase-3 was determined by activity assay kits and Western blotting. The expression of survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blottin.
n of Y2 receptor is the most abundant PYY receptor on pancreatic cancer cell. PYY inhibited MiaPaCa-2 cell proliferation, blocked it in G0/G1 phase, increased the proportion of apoptosis cells and caspase-3 activity, and reduced the expression of survivin, VEGF, and COX-.
ned the ability of the pancreatic MiaPaCa-2 cell viability through cell cycle blocking and apoptosis inducing. The inhibition effect of PYY may be mediated by the Y2 receptor. The increased caspase-3 activity and reduced expression of survivin, VEGF, and COX-2 may serve as a novel mechanism in PYY inhibition effect on MiaPaCa-2 cel.
the pattern of BAP1 inactivation in ocular melanoma specimens and in the BAP1 cutaneous melanoma (CM)/ocular melanoma predisposition syndrome suggests a tumor suppressor function, the specific role of this gene in the pathogenesis of CM is not fully understood. We thus set out to characterize BAP1 in CM and discovered an unexpected pro-survival effect of this protein. Tissue and cell lines analysis showed that BAP1 expression was maintained, rather than lost, in primary melanomas compared with nevi and normal skin. Genetic depletion of BAP1 in melanoma cells reduced proliferation and colony-forming capability, induced apoptosis, and inhibited melanoma tumor growth in vivo. On the molecular level, suppression of BAP1 led to a concomitant drop in the protein levels of survivin, a member of anti-apoptotic proteins and a known mediator of melanoma survival. Restoration of survivin in melanoma cells partially rescued the growth-retarding effects of BAP1 loss. In contrast to melanoma cells, stable overexpression of BAP1 into immortalized but non-transformed melanocytes did suppress proliferation and reduce survivin. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that BAP1 may have a growth-sustaining role in melanoma cells, but that its impact on ubiquitination underpins a complex physiology, which is context and cell dependen.
of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis of human gastric cancer MKN28 cells was explored. TNF-α induced up-regulation of cIAP2, whereas cycloheximide (CHX) induced down-regulation of XIAP and survivin. Degradation of cIAP1 and XIAP, but not survivin, was accelerated by co-treatment of cells with TNF-α and CHX, and TNF-α-induced up-regulation of cIAP2 was inhibited by BMS-345541 (NF-κB inhibitor). Treatment of MKN28 cells with TNF-α plus CHX induced degradation of survivin and activation of caspase-8 and -3, followed by degradation of cIAP1 and XIAP and apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitors (MG132 and epoxomicin) suppressed TNF-α plus CHX-induced degradation of survivin, cIAP1, and XIAP as well as apoptosis. A caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) suppressed TNF-α plus CHX-induced apoptosis, but allowed degradation of survivin, cIAP1 and XIAP. TNF-α receptor 1 and 2 were expressed on MKN28 cells. The magnitude of apoptosis induced by TNF-α plus BMS-345541 was much less than that induced by TNF-α plus CHX. These findings suggest that TNF-α plus CHX-induced apoptosis of gastric cancer MKN28 cells may be caused by accelerated degradation of the IAP family members (survivin, cIAP1, and XIAP), in addition to inhibition of NF-κB-dependent synthesis of anti-apoptotic molecule.
r agent FL118 was recently identified in screening of small-molecule inhibitors of human survivin expression. Although FL118 is a camptothecin analogue, its antitumor potency is much superior to other FDA-approved camptothecin analogues (irinotecan and topotecan). The mechanism of action (MOA) underlying the antitumor effects of FL118 remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that FL118 activates tumor suppressor p53 as a novel MOA in p53 wild-type cancer cells. Our studies show that this MOA involves an induction of proteasomal degradation of MdmX, a critical negative regulator of p53, in a manner largely independent of ATM-dependent DNA damage signaling pathway but dependent on E3-competent Mdm2. FL118 inhibits p53 polyubiquitination and monoubiquitination by Mdm2-MdmX E3 complex in cells and in cell-free systems. In contrast, FL118 stimulates Mdm2-mediated MdmX ubiquitination. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that FL118 slightly decreases Mdm2-p53 interactions and moderately increases Mdm2-MdmX interactions, suggesting a change of targeting specificity of Mdm2-MdmX E3 complex from p53 to MdmX, resulting in accelerated MdmX degradation. As a result, p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2-MdmX E3 complex is reduced, which in turn activates p53 signaling. Activation of the p53 pathway by FL118 induces p53-dependent senescence in colorectal cancer cells. However, in the absence of p53 or in the presence of MdmX overexpression, FL118 promotes p53-independent apoptosis. These two distinct cellular consequences collectively contribute to the potent effects of FL118 to inhibit clonogenic potential of colon cancer cells. This study identifies a potential application of FL118 as an MdmX inhibitor for targeted therapie.
s of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) have been well investigated in human cancers, where they are frequently overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Here we explored the role of baculoviral IAP repeat containing 6 (BIRC6), a member of IAPs, in human colorectal cancer (CRC.
estern blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine BIRC6 expression in 7 CRC cell lines and 126 CRC clinical samples. We determined the biological significance of BIRC6 in CRC cell lines by a lentivirus-mediated silencing metho.
ed that BIRC6 was overexpressed in CRC cell lines and clinical CRC tissues. BIRC6 overexpression was correlated with tumor size and invasion depth of CRC. BIRC6 overexpression is associated with worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.010). BIRC6 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at S phase, downregulated cyclin A2, B1, D1 and E1 levels, and sensitized CRC cells to chemotherapy in vitro and in viv.
ether, these data suggests that BIRC6 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and BIRC6 could be a potential target of CRC therap.
an association was observed between alleles in genes of the unfolded protein response pathway and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The goal of the current study is to investigate the role of these two genes, protein disulphide isomerase A member 5 (PDIA5) and baculoviral IAP repeat containing 6 (BIRC6), in different forms of glaucoma. 278 patients with POAG, 132 patients with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and 135 patients with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEXG) were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs11720822 in PDIA5 and 471 POAG, 184 PACG and 218 PEXG patients were genotyped for rs2754511 in BIRC6. Genotyping was done by allelic discrimination PCR, and genotype and allele frequencies were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were performed using R software to determine the association of these SNPs with glaucoma. The allele and genotype frequencies of rs11720822 in PDIA5 were not associated with POAG, PACG or PEXG. The TT genotype of rs2754511 in BIRC6 was found to be protective for PEXG (p = 0.05, OR 0.42 [0.22-0.81]) in the Pakistani population, but not for POAG or PACG. This study did not confirm a previously reported association of risk alleles in PDIA5 and BIRC6 with POAG, but did demonstrate a protective role of the T allele of rs2754511 in the BIRC6 gene in PEXG. This supports a role for the unfolded protein response pathway and regulation of apoptotic cell death in the pathogenesis of PEX.
e prognostic information of protein biomarkers for clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs), we analyzed them within prognostic groups of ccRCC harboring different tumor characteristics of this clinically and molecularly heterogeneous tumor entit.
croarrays from 145 patients with primary ccRCC were immunohistochemically analyzed for VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor), Ki67 (marker of proliferation 1), p53 (tumor protein p53), p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A), survivin (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5), and UEA-1 (Ulex europaeus agglutinin I) to assess microvessel-densit.
yzing all patients, nuclear staining of Ki67 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.12) and nuclear survivin (nS; HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08) were significantly associated with disease-specific survival (DSS). In the cohort of patients with advanced localized or metastasized ccRCC, high staining of Ki67, p53 and nS predicted shorter DSS (Ki67: HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.11; p53: HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09; nS: HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14). In organ-confined ccRCC, patients with high p21-staining had a longer DSS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99). In a multivariate model with stepwise backward elimination, tumor size and p21-staining showed a significant association with DSS in patients with &quot;organ-confined&quot; ccRCCs. The p21-staining increased the concordance index of tumor size from 0.75 to 0.78. In patients with &quot;organ-confined&quot; ccRCC, no disease-related deaths occurred in the group with p21-expression below the threshold of 32.5% p21-positive cells (log rank test: P=0.002.
ostic information of the studied protein biomarkers depended on anatomic tumor stages, which displayed different acquired biological tumor characteristics. Analysis of prognostic factors within different clinical ccRCC groups could help to enhance their prognostic power. The p21-staining was an independent prognostic factor and increased prognostic accuracy in a predictive model in &quot;organ-confined&quot; ccRC.
 differentially expressed genes and gene pathways in L02 cell line stably expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ib type nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) mediated by lentiviral system, and to provide a basis for further research of molecular biological mechanism of NS4B gene in chronic hepatitis C and hepatocarcinogenesi.
ly overexpressed L02 cell line and negative control stable L02 cell line, designated as L02-NS4B and L02-mkate2 respectively, were resurrected and amplified in vitro. The differentially expressed genes between L02-NS4B and L02-mkate2 were determined by gene expression microarray from Human Gene 1.0ST. The significant pathways of the differential genes were selected by the Fisher's exact test and χ2 test according to kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database. The differential expression levels of 5 selected genes including protein kinase C delta binding protein (PRKCDBP), tumor protein p53 (TP53), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3) and B-cell lymphoma 2-like1 (BCL2L1) from cDNA microarray data were further verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time QPCR.
02-NS4B and L02-mkate2, the genes with flurescence intensity ratio &gt;1.2 or &lt;0.8 were considered as differentially expressed genes. A total of 2 682 differentially expressed genes in the known 28 869 human genes were detected in L02-NS4B, 1 446 genes were upregulated and 1 236 genes were downregulated. A total of 41 involved pathways of up-regulated differential genes were identified by KEGG database, mainly including apoptosis, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, cell cycle, pathways in cancer and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway; and 20 involved pathways of down-regulated differential genes were identified, mainly including pathways in cancer, Wnt signaling pathway and cell cycle pathway. Of the 5 upregulated genes selected from cDNA microarray data, 3 genes showed the same differential expression pattern by real-time QPCR as that shown in cDNA microarray data, namely AKT1, BIRC3 and BCL2L1. The confirmation rate of real-time QPCR was 60.
an up-regulate or down-regulate the expression of many genes in L02 cells, thus affecting multiple signaling pathways relevant to cell apoptosis, cell cycle and carcinogenesi.
y of synuclein proteins (α, β and γ) are related to neurodegenerative disease e.g. Parkinson disease and Morbus Alzheimer. Additionally, a connection between γ-synuclein and glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells, which finally leads to blindness, exists. The reason for the development of glaucoma is still unknown. Recent studies evaluating the participation of immunological components, demonstrate complex changed antibody reactivities in glaucoma patients in comparison to healthy people, showing not only up-regulations (e.g. alpha-fodrin antibody) but also down-regulations (e.g. γ-synuclein antibody) of antibodies in glaucoma patients. Up-regulated antibodies could be auto-aggressive, but the role of down-regulated antibodies is still unclear. Previous studies show a significant influence of the serum and the antibodies of glaucoma patients on protein expression profiles of neuroretinal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of γ-synuclein antibody on the viability and reactive oxygen species levels of a neuroretinal cell line (RGC-5) as well as their interaction with cellular proteins. We found a protective effect of γ-synuclein antibody resulting in an increased viability (up to 15%) and decreased reactive oxygen species levels (up to -12%) of glutamate and oxidative stressed RGC-5. These can be traced back to anti-apoptotic altered protein expressions in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway indicated by mass spectrometry and validated by microarray analysis such as active caspase 3, bcl-2 associated-x-protein, S100A4, voltage-dependent anion channel, extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (down-regulated) and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 6, phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (up-regulated). These changed protein expression are triggered by the γ-synuclein antibody internalization of RGC-5 we could see in immunohistochemical stainings. These findings let us assume a novel physiological function of γ-synuclein antibodies and give insights in the role of autoantibodies in glaucoma. We hypothesize that the down-regulation of autoantibodies found in glaucoma patients lead to a loss of protective autoimmunit.
al IAP repeat containing 6 (BIRC6), an unusually large member of the IAP family, may play an important role in oncogenesis. The aim of this study was to assess the value of BIRC6 in predicting tumor recurrence after curative resection in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. In this study, the differences of BIRC6 expression in four paired EOC and normal tissue were performed by Western blot, and expression of BIRC6 protein was analyzed in 100 clinicopathologically characterized EOC cases from those who underwent curative resection between 2003 and 2011 by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank tests were used to assess the prognostic significance. It was found that BIRC6 expression was higher in the carcinoma tissue than in normal control tissue at protein level by Western blot. There was a significant difference of BIRC6 expression in patients categorized according to tumor differentiation (p = 0.016). Univariate analyses and multivariate analyses revealed that BIRC6 was an independent significant predictor for overall survival and disease-free survival. A prognostic significance of BIRC6 was also found by Kaplan-Meier method. The expression of BIRC6 in the cytoplasm is associated with EOC differentiation and may be a novel predictor for poor prognosis of EOC patients after curative resectio.
s nephropathy (MN), characterized by the presence of diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and subepithelial in situ immune complex disposition, is the most common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults, with an incidence of 5-10 per million per year. A number of studies have confirmed the relevance of several experimental insights to the pathogenesis of human MN, but the specific biomarkers of MN have not been fully elucidated. As a result, our knowledge of the alterations in histone methylation in MN is unclear. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze the variations in a methylated histone (H3K9me3) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 MN patients and 10 healthy subjects. There were 108 genes with significantly different expression in the MN patients compared with the normal controls. In MN patients, significantly increased activity was seen in 75 H3K9me3 genes, and decreased activity was seen in 33, compared with healthy subjects. Five positive genes, DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 6 (DGCR6), sorting nexin 16 (SNX16), contactin 4 (CNTN4), baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), and baculoviral IAP repeat containing 2 (BIRC2), were selected and quantified. There were alterations of H3K9me3 in MN patients. These may be candidates to help explain pathogenesis in MN patients. Such novel findings show that H3K9me3 may be a potential biomarker or promising target for epigenetic-based MN therapie.
 degeneration is an important area of research in modern neuroscience. A large number of genes are differentially regulated in the various stages of Wallerian degeneration, especially during the early response. In this study, we analyzed gene expression in early Wallerian degeneration of the distal nerve stump at 0, 0.5, 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours after rat sciatic nerve injury using gene chip microarrays. We screened for differentially-expressed genes and gene expression patterns. We examined the data for Gene Ontology, and explored the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway. This allowed us to identify key regulatory factors and recurrent network motifs. We identified 1 546 differentially-expressed genes and 21 distinct patterns of gene expression in early Wallerian degeneration, and an enrichment of genes associated with the immune response, acute inflammation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, ion transport and the extracellular matrix. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed components involved in the Jak-STAT, ErbB, transforming growth factor-β, T cell receptor and calcium signaling pathways. Key factors included interleukin-6, interleukin-1, integrin, c-sarcoma, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand, matrix metalloproteinase, BH3 interacting domain death agonist, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 and Rac. The data were validated with real-time quantitative PCR. This study provides a global view of gene expression profiles in early Wallerian degeneration of the rat sciatic nerve. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying early Wallerian degeneration, and the regulation of nerve degeneration and regeneratio.
he widespread application of RNA interference (RNAi) as a research tool for diverse purposes, the key step of strand selection of siRNAs during the formation of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) remains poorly understood. Here, using siRNAs targeted to the complementary region of Survivin and the effector protease receptor 1 (EPR-1), we show that both strands of the siRNA duplex can find their target mRNA and are equally eligible for assembly into Argonaute 2 (Ago2) of RISC in HEK293 cells. Transfection of the synthetic siRNA duplexes with different thermodynamic profiles or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors that generate double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), permitting processing specifically from either the 5' or 3' end of the incipient siRNA, results in the degradation of the respective target mRNAs of either strand of the siRNA duplex with comparable efficiencies. Thus, while most RNAi reactions may follow the thermodynamic asymmetry rule in strand selection, our study suggests an exceptional mode for certain siRNAs in which both strands of the duplex are competent in sponsoring RNAi, and implies additional factors that might dictate the RNAi target.
f this study is to detect the biologic and/or prognostic significance of survivin (S) and effector protease receptor 1: EPR-1 (E) expression in acute leukemias (34 ALL and 40 AML) by using RT-PCR. S and E expressions were found in 83.8 and 20.3% of the cases, respectively. S was detected in 90%, 76.5% and E was detected in 17.5%, 23.5% of the cases with AML and ALL, respectively. There was a significant correlation between S and E (r=0.30 p=0.01). Mortality rate was higher in E(-) cases than E(+) cases (83.1 % versus 66.7%) (p=0.04). The median DFS and OS rates were shorter in S(+) and E(-) cases. In subgroup analysis, there was not a significant difference for OS between S(-) and S(+) cases and E(-) and E(+) cases in ALL group. The median OS rate was significantly longer in S(-) cases than S(+) cases, and longer in E(+) cases than E(-) in AML groups (p=0.04, 0.001, respectively). OS and DFS rates were longest in S(-) E(+) cases and shortest in S(+) E(-) cases (p=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). In multivariate analyses EPR1 negativity was found to be an independent poor risk factor for survival (OR: 2.4, p=0.02). In conclusion S expression is a bad prognostic indicator in cases with acute leukemia especially in AML. S negativity and E positivity show good clinical outcome in acute leukemias. E expression is important due to its property of the possible natural anti-sense of the .
igate the relationship between the expression of effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1) of coagulation serine protease factor Xa, proliferative index (Pi) ki-67 and apoptotic index (AI) in nasopharyngeal carcinom.
unohistochemical S-P staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediate dUTP nick and labeling (TUNEL) technique, the expression of EPR-1, ki-67 and AI was detected in the paraffin-embedded specimens including 42 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues, 42 normal nasopharyngeal tissues adjacent to the tumors tissues and 30 chronic nasopharyngitis tissue.
ive rate of EPR-1 expression in the NPC tissues, normal nasopharyngeal tissues adjacent to the tumors and chronic nasopharyngeal tissues was 76.1%, 90.5%,100.0%, respectively. EPR-1 was positively correlated with AI and negatively with ki-6.
y a role in increase the apoptosis and decrease the proliferation of cell. These suggest that EPR-1 may be a potential therapy for NP.
apy of leukemia is a new and effective method. It is known to all that the pathogenesis and development of leukemia are related to a variety of genes. Survivin is a member of inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAP). Its cDNA was cloned from target cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1). It is expressed in common tumors, but there is no expression in normal and mature tissues. High expression of survivin was detected in leukemic cells. The present study was conducted to examine the role of survivin in the differentiation of leukemic cells by using antisense-oligonucleotide.
kemic cell K562 was used as the model for the study. K562 cells were divided into 4 groups randomly: antisense oligonucleuotide (ASON) group, nonsense oligonucleotide (NSON) group, lipofectin group and control group. There were 5 samples in each group, and the experiment was repeated for three times. ASON was designed with the reference to targeting survivin mRNA. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 contained fetal cattle serum at a concentration of about 10 percent. Cell transfection was induced by lipofectin. Forty-eight hours after thansfection, the morphology and ultrastructure were observed. Twenty-four hours and 48 hours after thansfection, the function of K562 cells was detected by benzidine staining, POX staining and NBT staining, respectively. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD33 was determined by flow cytometry. The method of immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein level of survivi.
nsfection with ASON, the size of K562 cells was reduced, but the cytoplasm was increased. The metarubricyte, segment granulocyte, apoptotic cells could be found. Morphologically and ultrastructurally, erythroid and myelocytic differentiation was observed. The positive level of benzidine staining in ASON group (11.90 +/- 2.30 at 24 h and 18.20 +/- 2.93 at 48 h) was higher than that of NSON group, lipofectin group and control group, respectively. The positive level of POX staining in ASON group (17.40 +/- 3.54 at 24 h and 29.40 +/- 3.70 at 48 h) was also higher than that of any other groups. The positive level of NBT staining in ASON group (7.50 +/- 2.26 at 24 h and 12.10 +/- 2.63 at 48 h) was significantly higher than that of NSON group, lipofectin group and control group, respectively (P &lt; 0.01). In ASON group, the mean fluorescence intensity of CD33 (21.43 +/- 1.61 at 24 h and 14.86 +/- 1.20 at 48 h) was significantly lower than that of any other groups (P &lt; 0.01). After thansfection for 24 h, the protein level of survivin in ASON group was decreased significantly compared to that of control group. There was no difference in survivin protein level amongst ASON group, NSON group and lipofectin group at 24 h (P &gt; 0.05). Forty-eight hours after thansfection, the protein level of survivin was decreased significantl.
eting survivin can induce K562 to erythroid and myelocytic differentiation. Survivin is related to differentiation of K562 cells, and it can be a target of gene therapy for leukemi.
igate the expression of effector protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), proliferative index ki-67 and apoptosis index in patients with primary advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and to clarify the significance of EPR-1 expression and its correlationship with the proliferation and apoptosis indexe.
unohistochemical staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labelling (TUNEL) technique, we determined the expression of EPR-1, proliferative index (Ki-67) and apoptotic index (AI) in 120 paraffin-embedded specimens of primary advanced gastric adenocarcinoma as well as lymph node metastasis and adjacent normal tissue.
ression was distributed in the cytoplasm of normal gastric mycoderma, carcinoma cells and smooth muscle cells. The positive rate of EPR-1 expression in the primary gastric adenocarcinomas, invasion tumor node and lymph node metastasis was 65.83%, 55.29% and 68%, respectively. While the positive rate in normal gastric mycoderma and smooth muscle cells was 46.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The average positive rate of ki-67 in EPR-1-positive tumors was 7.00% which was significantly lower than that of 8.53% in EPR-1-negative tumors, but the average AI in EPR-1-positive tumors was 1.25%, which was significantly higher than that of 1.00% observed in EPR-1-negative tumors. On the other hand, the average positive labeling index for Ki-67 (ki-67) in EPR-1-positive lymph node metastasis was 7.65%, which was significantly lower than that of 9.44% observed in EPR-1-negative lymph node metastasis. However, the average AI in EPR-1-positive lymph node metastasis tumors was 0.99%, which was significantly higher than that of 0.67% observed in EPR-1-negative lymph node metastasi.
ency of EPR-1 expression was significantly higher in primary gastric adenocarcinoma and in its lymph node metastasis than that in normal gastric mucosa. Expression of EPR-1 was significantly correlated with tumor histological subtypes and tumor differentiation. Weighted EPR-1 Score is positively correlated with apoptosis index, but is negatively related with proliferative index. Thus, Weighted EPR-1 Score and EPR-1 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells maybe a potential marker in clinical settin.
 an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) containing one baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, has been reported to be capable of regulating both cellular proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Survivin splice variants, survivin-DeltaEx3 and survivin-2B, have apparently retained and lost anti-apoptotic potential, respectively. As survivin was first discovered due to its high homology with effector cell protease receptor (EPR-1), a protein involved in blood coagulation, it has been suggested (but not proven) that EPR-1 may act as a natural anti-sense to survivin in cells. Survivin homologs have been found in non-human species. Survivin expression has been described during embryonic development and in adult cancerous tissues, with greatly reduced expression in adult normal differentiated tissues, particularly if their proliferation index is low. Survivin has been defined as a universal tumor antigen and as the fourth most significant transcriptosome expressed in human tumors. Although survivin is usually located in the cell cytoplasmic region and associated with poor prognosis in cancer, nuclear localisation, indicative of favorable prognosis, has also been reported. Survivin expression has also been reported in a number of proliferating normal adult tissues. Extensive research has been conducted, aimed at increasing our understanding of survivin, by determining its sub-cellular structure and location, mechanism(s) of action and control of expression. While much important information on this molecule has been accumulated, there are still many areas of controversy or limited information. Further research may enable exploitation of survivin overexpression in cancer compared to normal tissues, making survivin a potentially attractive target for cancer therapeutic.
 a novel inhibitor of apoptosis, is expressed in cancer cells and not in normal adult tissues, and is recognised as a potential target in anticancer therapy. The induction of a natural antisense of survivin, effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), in a human colon cancer cell line resulted in a downregulation of survivin expression, with a similar decrease in cell proliferation, an increase in apoptosis and an increase in the sensitivity to anticancer agents. In addition, subcutaneous (s.c.) tumours from EPR-1 transfectants showed a significant reduction in size compared with parental cells, and this antitumour efficacy was further enhanced in combination with anticancer agents. These findings suggest that regulation of survivin by the induction of EPR-1 cDNA may have significant potential as a therapy for human colon cance.
rombosis, vascular wall cells are exposed to clotting factors, including the procoagulant proteases thrombin and factor Xa (FXa), both known to induce cell signaling. FXa shows dose-dependent induction of intracellular Ca(2+) transients in vascular wall cells that is active-site-dependent, Gla-domain-independent, and enhanced by FXa assembly into the prothrombinase complex. FXa signaling is independent of prothrombin activation as shown by the lack of inhibition by argatroban, hirudin and the sulfated C-terminal peptide of hirudin (Hir(54-65)(SO3(-))). This peptide binds to both proexosite I in prothrombin and exosite I in thrombin. In contrast, signaling is completely blocked by the FXa inhibitor ZK-807834 (CI-1031). No inhibition is observed by peptides which block interaction of FXa with effector cell protease 1 receptor (EPR-1), indicating that this receptor does not mediate signaling in the cells assayed. Receptor desensitization studies with thrombin or peptide agonists (PAR-1 or PAR-2) and experiments with PAR-1-blocking antibodies indicate that signaling by FXa is mediated by both PAR-1 and PAR-2. Potential pathophysiological responses to FXa include increased cell proliferation, increased production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and increased production of prothrombotic tissue factor. These cellular responses, which may complicate vascular disease, are inhibited by ZK-80783.
is a newly discovered inhibitor of the apoptosis protein, IAP, expressed during development and in human cancers. The effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1) gene is oriented in the opposite direction on the same DNA double strand. Thus, the Survivin and EPR-1 (Survivin/EPR-1) genes exist in a head-to-head configuration. It is not clear whether mutual expression of the Survivin/EPR-1 genes occurs in both normal cells and cancer cells. Here, we investigated the mutual expression of the Survivin/EPR-1 genes in 12 normal peripheral blood (PB) specimens, seven normal bone marrow (BM) specimens, five lymph node (LN) specimens, and seven leukemic cell lines, and 27 patients with malignant lymphoma (ML), four with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), three with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and four with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis (CML-BC). Using Northern blot analysis, small amounts of EPR-1 mRNA were detected in normal PB, normal BM and LN specimens, but no Survivin mRNA was detected. However, Survivin mRNA was detected in two of the 12 normal PB, six of the seven normal BM and one of the five LN specimens using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of both the Survivin and EPR-1 genes was detected in six of the seven cell line samples by Northern blot, and in all of them by RT-PCR. Mutual expression of the Survivin and EPR-1 genes was detected in three of the four CML-BC samples, 15 of the 27 ML samples, two of the four ALL samples, and all three AML samples using the RT-PCR method. No EPR-1 expression with or without Survivin expression was clearly detected in eight of the nine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLB) specimens, two of the six follicular center lymphoma specimens, one of the four specimens of nodular sclerosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, two of the four ALL specimens or one of the four CML-BC specimens. The data presented here show that disrupted expression of the Survivin/EPR-1 genes occurred in many kinds of hematologically malignant cells. This may be of biological importanc.
on to its pivotal role in hemostasis, factor Xa binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells through the recognition of a protein called effector cell protease receptor (EPR-1). This interaction is associated with signal transduction, generation of intracellular second messengers, and modulation of cytokine gene expression. Inhibitors of factor Xa catalytic activity block these responses, thus indicating that the factor Xa-dependent event of local proteolysis is absolutely required for cell activation. Because EPR-1 does not contain proteolysis-sensitive sites, we investigated the possibility that signal transduction by factor Xa requires proteolytic activation of a member of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) gene family. Catalytic inactivation of factor Xa by DX9065 suppressed factor Xa-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca(2+) in endothelial cells (IC(50)=0.23 micromol/L) but failed to reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. In desensitization experiments, trypsin or the PAR-2-specific activator peptide, SLIGKV, ablated the Ca(2+) signaling response induced by factor Xa. Conversely, pretreatment of endothelial cells with factor Xa blocked the PAR-2-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling, whereas PAR-1-dependent responses were unaffected. Direct cleavage of PAR-2 by factor Xa on endothelial cells was demonstrated by cleavage of a synthetic peptide duplicating the PAR-2 cleavage site and by immunofluorescence with an antibody to a peptide containing the 40-amino acid PAR-2 extracellular extension. These data suggest that factor Xa induces endothelial cell activation via a novel cascade of receptor activation involving docking to EPR-1 and local proteolytic cleavage of PAR-.
lation protease factor Xa induces cellular responses implicated in cardiovascular and inflammatory disease. Effector-cell protease receptor 1 (EPR-1) is a functionally characterized receptor of factor Xa, and the EPR-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) was published. Remarkably, the cDNA encoding an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, is reportedly identical to that of EPR-1 except for a few nucleotide differences and its orientation opposite to EPR-1. To isolate the EPR-1 cDNA and gene, we surveyed gene databases for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that could be derived from EPR-1. All ESTs with strong homology to EPR-1/survivin were derived from survivin and could not encode EPR-1. By polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization, EPR-1 was not detectable in the human or murine genome, but survivin was. Our data suggest that EPR-1 is either highly cell-specific or the published EPR-1 cDNA includes sequences from clones derived from survivin messenger RNA. The means by which factor Xa mediates its cellular effects requires further evaluatio.
matory effects induced by the serine protease factor Xa were investigated in HUVEC. Exposure of cells to factor Xa (5-80 nM) concentration dependently stimulated the production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and the expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, which was accompanied by polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesion. The effects of factor Xa were blocked by antithrombin III, but not by the thrombin-specific inhibitor hirudin, suggesting that factor Xa elicits these responses directly and not via thrombin. IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha were not implicated, since neither the IL-1 receptor antagonist nor a TNF-neutralizing Ab could suppress the factor Xa responses. Active site-inhibited factor Xa and factor Xa depleted from gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues were completely inactive. The effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1) seems not to be involved since anti-EPR-1 Abs failed to inhibit cytokine production. Moreover, neither the factor X peptide Leu83-Leu88, representing the inter-epidermal growth factor sequence in factor Xa that mediates ligand binding to EPR-1, nor the peptide AG1, corresponding to the EPR-1 sequence Ser123-Pro137 implicated in factor Xa binding, inhibited the factor Xa-induced cytokine production. In conclusion, these findings indicate that factor Xa evokes a proinflammatory response in endothelial cells, which requires both its catalytic and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain. The receptor system involved in these responses induced by factor Xa remains to be establishe.
is a new IAP apoptosis inhibitor expressed during development and in human cancer in vivo. The coding strand of the survivin gene was extensively complementary to that of effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), prompting the present investigation on the origin and functional relationship of these two transcripts. Southern blots of genomic DNA were consistent with the presence of multiple, evolutionarily conserved, EPR-1/Survivin-related genes. By pulsed field gel electrophoresis and single- and two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, these were contained within a contiguous physical interval of 75-130 kilobases (kb) on chromosome 17q25. In Northern blots, a single strand-specific probe identified a 1.3-kb EPR-1 mRNA broadly distributed in normal adult and fetal tissues, structurally distinct from the 1.9-kb Survivin transcript expressed in transformed cell lines. Transient co-transfection of an EPR-1 cDNA potentially acting as a Survivin antisense with a lacZ reporter plasmid resulted in loss of viability of HeLa cells. In contrast, co-transfection of an antisense cDNA of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or a sense-oriented Survivin cDNA was without effect. In stably transfected HeLa cells, ZnSO4 induction of an EPR-1 mRNA under the control of a metallothionein promoter suppressed the expression of endogenous survivin. This resulted in (i) increased apoptosis as detected by analysis of DNA content and in situ internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and (ii) inhibition of cell proliferation as compared with induced vector control transfectants. These findings suggest the existence of a potential EPR-1/survivin gene cluster and identify survivin as a new target for disrupting cell viability pathways in cance.
ng of 125I-factor Xa to human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) monolayers was studied. At 4 degreesC, 125I-factor Xa bound to a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant value of 3.6+/-0.7 nM and a binding site density of 11,720+/-1,240 sites/cell (n = 9). 125I-factor Xa binding was not affected by factor X, thrombin, or by DX9065, a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, but was inhibited by factor Xa (IC50 = 5.4+/-0.2 nM; n = 9) and by antibodies specific for the effector cell protease receptor 1 (EPR-1), a well-known receptor of factor Xa on various cell types. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88-(Gly) blocked the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 110+/-21 nM). Factor Xa increased phosphoinositide turnover in SMCs and when added to SMCs in culture was a potent mitogen. These effects were inhibited by DX9065 and by antibodies directed against EPR-1 and PDGF. Increased expression of EPR-1 was identified immunohistochemically on SMCs growing in culture and in SMCs from the rabbit carotid artery after vascular injury. When applied locally to air-injured rabbit carotid arteries, antibodies directed against EPR-1 (100 mug/ artery) strongly reduced myointimal proliferation 14 d after vascular injury (65-71% inhibition, P &lt; 0.01). DX9065 (10 mg/kg, subcutaneous) inhibited myointimal proliferation significantly (43% inhibition, P &lt; 0.05). These findings indicate that SMCs express functional high affinity receptors for factor Xa related to EPR-1, which may be of importance in the regulation of homeostasis of the vascular wall and after vascular injur.
r cells induce platelet aggregation in the bloodstream, which has been implicated in tumor metastasis. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of platelet aggregation induced by a human neuroblastoma cell line, GOTO. It was revealed that GOTO cells had tissue factor on their surface and converted factor X (FX) to FXa with the aid of factor VIIa. The produced FXa formed prothrombinase complex on the cells and activated prothrombin. From experiments on activity inhibition by specific monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies, it was concluded that factor V did not constitute this prothrombinase complex. Another cofactor known to constitute prothrombinase complex on some cells, effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), was not expressed on GOTO cells, suggesting that the cofactor composing FXa-dependent prothrombinase activity on GOTO cells is not factor V or EPR-1 but, rather, is an unknown molecule. Upon the culturing in the presence of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine for 4 days, GOTO cells differentiated into Schwann-like cells, and both FXase and prothrombinase activities were greatly diminished. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the decrease of FXase activity should be attributed to the decrease of tissue factor expression on GOTO cells. Because these activities greatly diminished upon cellular differentiation, the expression of both cofactor molecules may be related to the malignant and metastatic nature of the tumor cell.
of vascular injury thrombin is generated via prothrombinase, a stoichiometric (1:1), Ca2+-dependent, and membrane-bound complex consisting of the nonenzymatic cofactor factor Va and the serine protease factor Xa. While the importance of anionic platelet membrane phospholipids in regulating thrombin generation is well recognized, the identification of regulatory protein receptors has eluded investigators. This study reports the first description of a human platelet membrane protein that regulates prothrombinase complex assembly and function. Direct platelet-protein binding studies indicated that, although required, platelet-bound factor Va alone is insufficient to mediate factor Xa binding, and that factor Va and factor Xa bind to discrete sites on activated platelets for which expression is independently regulated as a function of the agonist concentration. When specific monoclonal antibodies against effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1, a 65-kDa membrane receptor for factor Xa) were used in Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and/or flow cytometric analyses, activated platelets and their precursors, megakaryocytes, were shown to express EPR-1. These results were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of mRNA extracted from megakaryocyte-like cell lines. Additional flow cytometric studies demonstrated that a platelet-bound factor Va/factor Xa complex precluded binding of the anti-EPR-1 antibody, B6, to activated platelets by approximately 50%. Likewise, the anti-EPR-1 antibody was shown to inhibit prothrombinase-catalyzed thrombin generation on activated platelets in a dose- and platelet donor-dependent manner, indicating that platelet-expressed EPR-1 mediates factor Xa assembly into the prothrombinase complex. These collective data indicate that both EPR-1 and membrane-bound factor Va are required to mediate factor Xa binding to the activated platelet to form a functional prothrombinase comple.
f factor Xa to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is contributed by effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1). The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells. Similarly, factor Xa active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of factor Xa to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injur.
ng and assembly of the coagulation proteases on the endothelial cell surface are important steps not only in the generation of thrombin and thrombogenesis, but also in vascular cell signaling. Effector cell protease receptor (EPR-1) was identified as a novel leukocyte cell surface receptor recognizing the coagulation serine protease Factor Xa but not the precursor Factor X. We now demonstrate that EPR-1 is expressed on vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Northern blots of endothelial and smooth muscle cells demonstrated three abundant mRNA bands of 3.0, 1.8, and 1.3 kDa. 125I-Labeled Factor Xa bound to endothelial cells in a dose-dependent saturable manner, and the binding was inhibited by antibody to EPR-1. No specific binding was observed with a recombinant mutant Factor X in which the activation site was substituted by Arg196 --&gt; Gln to prevent the proteolytic conversion to Xa. EPR-1 was identified immunohistochemically on microvascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Functionally, exposure of smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells to Factor Xa induced a 3-fold and a 2-fold increase in [3H]thymidine uptake, respectively. However, receptor occupancy alone is insufficient for mitogenic signaling because the active site of the enzyme is required for mitogenesis. Thus, EPR-1 represents a site of specific protease-receptor complex assembly, which during local initiation of the coagulation cascade could mediate cellular signaling and responses of the vessel wal.
ssion of a cellular receptor for the blood-clotting protease factor Xa, designated effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), was investigated in lymphoma. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated prominent reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to EPR-1 with Reed-Sternberg cells in 30 of 35 cases of nodular-sclerosis, lymphocyte-depletion, and mixed-cellularity Hodgkin's disease (HD). In contrast, several non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, or the nonneoplastic cellular components of HD, did not react with anti-EPR-1 monoclonal antibodies. A single molecular species of approximately 62 kD, consistent with the size and structural organization of EPR-1, was immunoblotted by an anti-EPR-1 monoclonal antibody from tissue samples of HD, but not from normal lymph nodes. Expression of EPR-1 transcripts in Reed-Sternberg cells was demonstrated by in situ hybridization with an antisense EPR-1 riboprobe, and by amplification of reverse-transcribed HD RNA with EPR-1-specific primers. These findings identify the factor Xa receptor, EPR-1, as a novel marker of Reed-Sternberg cells, and suggest its potential role in the histopathogenesis of H.
uman inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family member termed Livin was identified, containing a single baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain and a COOH-terminal RING finger domain. The mRNA for livin was not detectable by Northern blot in most normal adult tissues with the exception of the placenta, but was present in developmental tissues and in several cancer cell lines. Highest levels were observed in two melanoma-derived cell lines, G361 and SK-Mel29. Transfection of livin in HeLa cells resulted in protection from apoptosis induced by expression of FADD, Bax, RIP, RIP3, and DR6. Similar to other IAP family members, the anti-apoptotic activity of Livin was dependent on the BIR domain. Livin was also capable of inhibiting DEVD-like caspase activity triggered by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In vitro binding studies demonstrated a direct interaction between Livin and the active form of the downstream caspases, caspase-3 and -7, that was dependent on the BIR domain of Livin. In addition, the unprocessed and cleaved forms of caspase-9 co-immunoprecipitated with Livin in vivo, and recombinant Livin could inhibit the activation of caspase-9 induced by Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and dATP. The subcellular distribution of the transfected Livin was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Both Livin and Survivin were expressed in the nucleus and in a filamentous pattern throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast to the apoptotic activity, the COOH-terminal RING domain mediated its subcellular localization patterning. Further studies found that transfection of an antisense construct against livin could trigger apoptosis specifically in cell lines expressing livin mRNA. This was associated with an increase in DNA fragmentation and in DEVD-like caspase activity. Thus, disruption of Livin may provide a strategy to induce apoptosis in certain cancer cell.
lure due to myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. We found previously that A83-01, a TGFβRI inhibitor, could facilitate cardiac repair in post-MI mice and induce the expansion of a Nkx2.5 + cardiomyoblast population. This study aimed to investigate the key autocrine/paracrine factors regulated by A83-01 in the injured heart and the mechanism of cardioprotection by this molecule. Using a previously described transgenic Nkx2.5 enhancer-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mice, we isolated cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) including Nkx2.5-GFP + (Nkx2.5+), sca1+, and Nkx2.5+/sca1 + cells. A83-01 was found to induce proliferation of these three subpopulations mainly through increasing Birc5 expression in the MEK/ERK-dependent pathway. Survivin, encoded by Birc5, could also directly proliferate Nkx2.5 + cells and enhance cultured cardiomyocytes viability. A83-01 could also reverse the downregulation of Birc5 in postinjured mice hearts (n = 6) to expand CPCs. Moreover, the increased Wnt3a in postinjured hearts could decrease CPCs, which could be reversed by A83-01 via inhibiting Fzd6 and Wnt1-induced signaling protein 1 expressions in CPCs. Next, we used inducible αMHC-cre/mTmG mice to label cardiomyocytes with GFP and nonmyocytes with RFP. We found A83-01 preserved more GFP + myocytes (68.6% ± 3.1% vs. 80.9% ± 3.0%; p &lt; .05, n = 6) and fewer renewed RFP + myocytes (0.026% ± 0.005% vs. 0.062% ± 0.008%; p &lt; .05, n = 6) in parallel with less cardiac fibrosis in isoprenaline-injected mice treated with A83-01. TGFβRI inhibition in an injured adult heart could both stimulate the autocrine/paracrine activity of survivin and inhibit Wnt in CPCs to mediate cardioprotection and improve cardiac function.

tion factor E2F1 is a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Recently, it has been shown that aberrant E2F1 expression often detectable in advanced cancers contributes essentially to cancer cell propagation and characterizes the aggressive potential of a tumor. Conceptually, this requires a subset of malignant cells capable of evading apoptotic death through anticancer drugs. The molecular mechanism by which the pro-apoptotic activity of E2F1 is antagonized is widely unclear. Here we report a novel function for EPC1 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 1) in DNA damage protection. Depletion of EPC1 potentiates E2F1-mediated apoptosis in response to genotoxic treatment and abolishes tumor cell motility. We found that E2F1 directly binds to the EPC1 promoter and EPC1 vice versa physically interacts with bifunctional E2F1 to modulate its transcriptional activity in a target gene-specific manner. Remarkably, nuclear-colocalized EPC1 activates E2F1 to upregulate the expression of anti-apoptotic survival genes such as BCL-2 or Survivin/BIRC5 and inhibits death-inducing targets. The uncovered cooperativity between EPC1 and E2F1 triggers a metastasis-related gene signature in advanced cancers that predicts poor patient survival. These findings unveil a novel oncogenic function of EPC1 for inducing the switch into tumor progression-relevant gene expression that may help to set novel therapie.
 we showed that Sulindac (SU; 320&nbsp;ppm) reduces precancerous lesions in the colon of Pirc rats, mutated in the Apc gene. Surprisingly, previous data in Apc-mutated mice showed that SU, with reported efficacy in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), increases colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we assessed the effect of SU 320&nbsp;ppm in a long-term carcinogenesis experiment in Pirc rats. Moreover, since side effects of SU hamper its chronic use and a combination of drugs could be more effective and less toxic than single agents, we also studied whether two natural compounds, 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM; 250&nbsp;ppm) and curcumin (CUR; 2000&nbsp;ppm), with or without lower doses of SU could affect carcinogenes.
 were fed an AIN76 diet containing SU, DIM and CUR and sacrificed at 8&nbsp;months of age to measure intestinal tumours. Apoptosis and proliferation in the normal colon mucosa, as well as gene expression profile were studi.
ours were significantly reduced by SU 320&nbsp;ppm (62&nbsp;% reduction over Controls), by DIM and CUR without or with SU 80 and 160&nbsp;ppm (50, 53 and 58&nbsp;% reduction, respectively) but not by SU 80&nbsp;ppm alone. Total tumours (colon and small intestine) were reduced by SU (80 and 320&nbsp;ppm) and by DIM and CUR. Apoptosis in the normal mucosa was significantly increased by SU 320&nbsp;ppm, and slightly increased by DIM and CUR with or without SU. A slight reduction in Survivin-Birc5 expression was observed with all the treatments compared to Controls. Proliferative activity was not vari.
ts on SU reinforce the validity of Pirc rats to identify chemopreventive products. Moreover, the efficacy of the DIM and CUR combination to lower colon tumours, suggests an alternative strategy to be exploited in patients at ris.
exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an anticonvulsant and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), increases the risk of congenital malformations. Although the mechanisms leading to the teratogenicity of VPA remain unsolved, several HDAC inhibitors increase cell death in cancer cell lines and embryonic tissues. Moreover, P53, the master regulator of apoptosis, is an established HDAC target. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of VPA on P53 signaling and markers of apoptosis during midorganogenesis in vitro limb development. Timed-pregnant CD1 mice (gestation day 12) were euthanized; embryonic forelimbs were excised and cultured in vitro for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hr in the presence or absence of VPA or valpromide (VPD), a non-HDACi analog of VPA. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots were used to assess the expression of candidate genes and proteins involved in P53 signaling and apoptosis. P53 hyperacetylation and a decrease (Survivin/Birc5 and Bcl2) or an increase (p21/Cdkn1a) in the expression of p53 target genes was observed only in VPA-exposed limbs. VPA exposure also triggered an increase in markers of apoptosis and DNA damage; the concentrations of cleaved caspase 9 and caspase 3, cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and γ-H2AX were increased in VPA-exposed limbs. VPD treatment caused a small but significant increase in cleaved caspase 3. Thus, in vitro exposure to an HDACi such as VPA leads to P53 hyperacetylation, enhances the expression of P53 target genes, and triggers an increase in apoptosis that may contribute to teratogenicit.
e the effect of anti-survivin oligonucleotides (ASODN) on the invasion and growth of peritoneally implanted ovarian cancer cell xenografts in nude mic.
e models bearing peritoneally implanted ovarian cancer cell (SKOV3) xenografts were established and subjected to intraperitoneal injection of survivin ASODN or saline (control). The number and weight of the intraperitoneal xenografts were compared between the two groups.The expressions of interleukin (IL-6), signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3), phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), and survivin protein in the tumor tissues were detected with Western blotting in both group.
with those in the control group, the number and weight of the intraperitoneal xenografts were significantly reduced in ASODN group (P&lt;0.05). ASODN treatment also resulted in significantly lowered protein levels of IL-6, STAT3, p-STAT3, and survivin in the tumor tissues (P&lt;0.05.
ASODN can suppress the invasion and migration capacity of ovarian cancer cells and inhibit peritoneal metastasis of the tumor in nude mice possibly though down-regulation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathwa.
 infants are at an increased risk of developing cognitive and motor handicaps due to chronic hypoxia. Although the current therapies have reduced the incidence of these handicaps, untoward side effects abound. Using a murine model of sublethal hypoxia, we demonstrated reduction in several transcription factors that modulate expression of genes known to be involved in several neural functions. We demonstrate the induction of these genes by minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic with noncanonical functions, in both in&nbsp;vitro and in&nbsp;vivo studies. Specifically, there was induction of genes, including Sox10, Hif1a, Hif2a, Birc5, Yap1, Epo, Bdnf, Notch1 (cleaved), Pcna, Mag, Mobp, Plp1, synapsin, Adgra2, Pecam1, and reduction in activation of caspase 3, all known to affect proliferation, apoptosis, synaptic transmission, and nerve transmission. Minocycline treatment of mouse pups reared under sublethal hypoxic conditions resulted in improvement in open field testing parameters. These studies demonstrate beneficial effects of minocycline treatment following hypoxic insult, document up-regulation of several genes associated with improved cognitive function, and support the possibility of minocycline as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of neurodevelopmental handicaps observed in the very premature newborn population. Additionally, these studies may aid in further interpretation of the effects of minocycline in the treatment trials&nbsp;and animal model studies of fragile X syndrome and multiple sclerosi.
(BIRC5) is highly expressed in the vast majority of human cancers and is associated with chemotherapy resistance, increased tumor recurrence and shortened patient survival, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Initially identified as an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, it also plays a major role in the regulation of cell division. As such, it acts as a subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex, composed of the mitotic kinase aurora B, borealin and inner centromere protein, and is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. For both biological functions, interaction of survivin's nuclear export signal with the nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1 is absolutely essential. The timely orchestration of survivin's wide protein interaction repertoire is further modulated by different posttranslational modifications occurring in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Recent data furthermore indicate additional roles of survivin in the DNA damage response, contributing to therapy resistance, yet the underlying molecular details are still not completely resolved. This also holds true for a potential involvement of survivin in senescence regulation. An age-related accumulation of survivin probably contributes to the apoptosis resistance observed in aged as well as in senescent cells, while it might promote escape from therapy-induced senescence. This review seeks to integrate the current knowledge on survivin's diverse and complex biological functions. By linking the 'old' facts about survivin with recent findings in research areas such as DNA damage response and aging, we want to highlight survivin's crucial role in a variety of cellular processes. © 2015 S.

orms of neuroblastoma (NB), a childhood malignancy that develops from immature neuronal progenitor cells frequently carry a gain of chromosome 17q, which leads to overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BIRC5/Survivin. We have recently shown that high Survivin expression shuts down mitochondrial complex I activity and shifts NB cells from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, which further increases resistance to cell death induction. This increased glucose consumption sensitized tumor cells to glycolysis inhibitors. Interestingly, in Survivin-overexpressing cells 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) treatment induces re-fusion of mitochondrial networks after 4 h, which coincides with Survivin repression. 2DG selectively acts on Survivin-expressing NB cells and induces autophagic degradation of Survivin via activation of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin, a downstream target of PINK1. Survivin degradation further releases bound Beclin-1, which enhances autophagy and cell death induction. Knockdown of Parkin, however, reduces the sensitivity of Survivin-expressing NB cells to glycolysis inhibition. The selective activity of 2DG treatment on Survivin-overexpressing tumor cells was also confirmed in a xenograft mouse model, which further supports our hypothesis that glycolysis inhibitors might be useful drugs in the treatment of NB.Oncogene advance online publication, 6 July 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.26.
ssion of survivin is observed in various hematological malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Studies show that elevated expression of survivin correlates with a worse clinic outcome in AML patients. It remains unclear whether inhibition of survivin may alter the efficacy of chemotherapy against AML. Here, we evaluate the effects of specific knockdown of survivin on AML cells' sensitivity to chemotherapy, and investigate the therapeutic potential of the transcription inhibitor of survivin YM155 either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. We found Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells had relatively higher expression levels of survivin among all AML cell lines tested. Specific knockdown of survivin in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells resulted in: inhibition of cell proliferation; cell cycle G2/M arrest; induction of DNA damage response and apoptosis. Downregulation of survivin enhanced etoposide- or doxorubicin-induced anti-proliferative/anti-survival activity in AML cells. The small molecule inhibitor YM155 reduced survivin in a dose- and time-dependent manner and trigged apoptosis in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells. The combinatorial effects of YM155 and chemotherapeutics were either synergetic or antagonistic, depending upon the drugs used for combination and the type of AML cells being treated. Collectively, our data demonstrate that survivin plays an important role in the maintenance and proliferation of AML cells. While specific knockdown of survivin enhances chemosensitivity, the combinations of YM155 and chemotherapeutic agents exhibit synergetic or antagonistic effects on AML cells. Our findings provide a rationale for further assessment of survivin-targeted therapy in the treatment of patients with AM.
U937 (acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines) were assessed for sensitivity to YM155, and found to have distinct sensitive and resistant phenotypes, respectively. In HL60 cells, YM155 inhibition of growth proliferation was due to apoptosis which was measured by annexin V/PI staining. YM155 induced apoptosis through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways that also culminated in caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. YM155 sensitivity was partially associated with this compound's ability to down-regulate survivin transcription since this was more pronounced in the HL60 cell line. However, marked differences were also observed in XIAP, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1L, and Mcl-1s. Furthermore, YM155 treatment completely inhibited production of total Akt protein in HL60, but not U937 cells. Importantly, Akt activity (pAkt-Ser473) levels were maintained in YM155 treated U937 cells which may help stabilize other anti-apoptotic proteins. Combination treatments with an Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, reduced levels of pAkt-Ser473 in U937 cells and synergistically sensitized them to YM155 cytotoxicity. Collectively our results indicate that Akt signaling may be an important factor mediating YM155 response in AML, and combinatorial therapies with Akt inhibitors could improve treatment efficacy in YM155-resistant cell.
l cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The high frequency of positive families shows the importance of public awareness and screening strategies in those families. Cancer/testis (CT) antigens such as Aurora-C and Survivin are a group of antigens expressed in various tumor types of human cancers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Aurora-C and Survivin genes in malignant and normal tissues and their correlation to clinicopathological characteristic.
ples were obtained from 33 patients and adjacent non-tumorous tissues from 7 patients were also used as control. Patients were diagnosed with various stages of colorectal cancer. The level of Aurora-C and Survivin genes were evaluated by using real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reactio.
ssion pattern of Survivin and Aurora-C revealed significant changes in tumor tissues when compared with normal tissues (p &lt; 0.05). Also, these expressions were associated with the grade of disease and tumor size. There was no significant relationship between the expression of Survivin and Aurora-C genes (p &gt; 0.05.
sion, the overexpression of Aurora-C and Survivin genes may play an important role in the development of colorectal cancer and may play a potential role in cancer therap.
 (PRL)-stimulated beta cell proliferation is critical for maternal pancreatic beta cell mass expansion during pregnancy. However, the molecular effectors of the multiple putative signalling pathways downstream of the PRL receptor (PRL-R) are still elusive. Survivin has been shown to be induced during pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to define the essential role of survivin in gestational beta cell mass expansio.
n of survivin was assessed in mouse islets during pregnancy and in insulinoma cells (INS-1) stimulated with PRL. Pregnant mice with targeted deletion of the survivin gene (also known as Birc5) in beta cells were assessed to determine the essential function of survivin in maternal beta cell mass expansion. INS-1 cells stimulated with PRL were used to explore the role of survivin in signalling pathways downstream of the PRL-.
was significantly upregulated in maternal islets during pregnancy. With PRL stimulation, induction of survivin expression occurred predominantly in the nucleus and was associated with cell cycle progression to S and G2/M phase. Beta cell-specific survivin-knockout pregnant mice displayed glucose intolerance, attenuated beta cell mass expansion and impaired beta cell proliferation, with significant attenuation in the increased expression of Cdk4/Ccnd1, E2f1, p53 (also known as Trp53) and p21 (also known as Cdkn1a) compared with wild-type controls during pregnancy. Targeted deletion of survivin in INS-1 cells resulted in cell cycle disturbance with an arrest in G1/S phase after PRL stimulation. Inhibitors of Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), PIM or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), significantly decreased the expression of survivin in PRL-stimulated INS-1 cell.
directly participates in PRL-mediated beta cell proliferation via Akt, STAT5-PIM and ERK signalling pathways during pregnanc.
ncer (BC) is a major health problem for women around the world. Although advances in the field of molecular therapy have been achieved, the successful therapeutic management of BC, particularly metastatic disease, remains a challenge for patients and clinicians. One of the areas of current investigation is the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which have a determinant role in the development of distant metastasis. At the present, many of the available treatment strategies for metastatic disease are of limited benefit. However, the elucidation of the mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis may help to identify key molecules/components that may function as therapeutic targets in the future. In the present study, the functional analysis of CTCs revealed their ability to grow and proliferate to form colonies. Immunofluorescence staining of the CTCs' colonies exhibits elevated expression of cell growth and survival associated proteins such as, survivin, ERK and Akt1. More importantly, the functional screening of the chemokine profile in BC patients' sera revealed an HR-independent elevation of the chemokine CXCL10 when compared to healthy controls. The analysis of chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL11 demonstrated an HR-dependent production pattern. The levels of both CXCL9 and CXCL11 were markedly high in HR+ patients' sera when compared to HR- patients and healthy controls. The functional analysis of HR+ and HR- BC derived cell lines when cultivated in media supplemented with patients' sera demonstrated the alteration of tumor progression and metastasis related proteins. We noted the induction of survivin, β-catenin, MKP-1, pERK, CXCR4 and MMP-1 both at the protein and mRNA levels. The induction of those proteins was in keeping with patients' sera induced cell proliferation as measured by the MTT assay. In conclusion, our data emphasizes the role of chemokines, especially CXCL10, in BC progression and metastasis via the induction of signaling pathways, which mainly involve survivin, β-catenin, MKP-1 and MMP-.
cal significance of the immunoexpression of survivin in prostate cancer and its correlation with the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to compare the immunoexpression of survivin in prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as well as to determine whether this immunoexpression could correlate with Gleason score, proliferation activity and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. The prostate needle biopsies from 28 patients with elevated serum PSA levels were studied. As a control, 12 needle biopsies of prostate diagnosed as BPH were used. The immunoexpression of survivin was evaluated semiquantitatively, whereas the Ki-67 index was assessed quantitatively. The immunoexpression of survivin and Ki-67 in epithelial cells in the prostate cancer group was significantly increased as compared to BPH cases. In the prostate cancer group there were positive significant correlations between the immunoexpression of survivin and Gleason score as well as Ki&#8209;67 antigen. The correlation between the immunoexpression of survivin and PSA levels was also positive, but it did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, we can confirm that in prostate cancer the immunoexpression of survivin is augmented as compared to BPH and positively correlated with parameters of tumor aggressivenes.
e the relationship between the expression of Survivin and Ki67 with prognosis of pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs.
tochemistry for Survivin and Ki67 was performed in 25 cases of normal pancreatic tissues and 81 cases of PETs by tissue microarrays and to observe the expression and evaluate the relationship with prognosi.
pression of Survivin and Ki67 in PETs was significantly higher than that in normal pancreatic tissues (P &lt;0.01); (2)The expression of Survivin and Ki67 in PETs was correlated with tissue grading and the TNM-staging (P &lt; 0.05), but not related with tumor size, location and functional status. In addition, the expression of nuclear Survivin was association with lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.05). (3)The high expression of Ki67 was related with the expression of nuclear Survivin, but not related with the expression of cytoplasmic Survivi.
and Ki67 were both expressed in PETs, which were closely related to the clinical pathological characteristics. They could be used as new indicators in the evaluation of prognosis of PETs. The expression of Survivin in nucleus had more diagnostic significance than that in cytoplasm, and that could be highly correlated with lymph node metastasis, which would be used as a new marker of poor prognosi.
tative cancer stem cell marker, deemed to aid chemoresistance. However, this claim has been challenged recently and we previously reported that patients with CD133(+) colon cancer have benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy incontrast to no benefit in patients with CD133(-) cancer. To elucidate the role of CD133 expression in chemoresistance, we silenced the CD133 expression in a colon cancer cell line and determined its effect on the biological characteristics downstream. We comparatively analyzed the sequential changes of MDR1, ABCG2, AKT1 and survivin expression and the result of proliferation assay (WST-1 assay) with 5-FU treatment in CD133(+) and siRNA-induced CD133(-) cells, derived from Caco-2 colon cancer cell line. 5-FU treatment induced significantly increase of the mRNA expression of MDR1, ABCG2 and AKT1genes, but not protein level. CD133 had little to no effect on the mRNA and protein expression of these genes. However, survivin expression at mRNA and protein level were significantly increased in CD133(+) cells compared with siRNA-induced CD133-cells and Mock (not sorted CD133(+) cells) at 96 h after siRNA transfection. The cytotoxicity assay demonstrated notable increase of chemoresistance to 5-FU treatment (10 μM) in CD133(+) cells at 96 h after siRNA transfection. From this study, we conclude that CD133(+) cells may have chemoresistance to 5-FU through the mechanism which is related with survivin expression, instead of MDR1, ABCG2 and AKT1 expression. Therefore a survivin inhibitor can be a new target for effective treatment of CD133(+) colon cance.
myeloma (MM) is an incurable haematological malignancy characterised by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow. We have previously identified pituitary tumour transforming gene 1 (Pttg1) as a gene that is significantly upregulated in the haematopoietic compartment of the myeloma-susceptible C57BL/KaLwRij mouse strain, when compared with the myeloma-resistant C57BL/6 mouse. Over-expression of PTTG1 has previously been associated with malignant progression and an enhanced proliferative capacity in solid tumour.
tudy, we investigated PTTG1 gene and protein expression in MM plasma cells from newly diagnosed MM patients. Gene expression profiling was used to identify gene signatures associated with high PTTG1 expression in MM patients. Additionally, we investigated the effect of short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA)-mediated PTTG1 knockdown on the proliferation of the murine myeloma plasma cell line 5TGM1 in vitro and in viv.
 found to be over-expressed in 36-70&nbsp;% of MM patients, relative to normal controls, with high PTTG1 expression being associated with poor patient outcomes (hazard ratio 2.49; 95&nbsp;% CI 1.28 to 4.86; p = 0.0075; log-rank test). In addition, patients with high PTTG1 expression exhibited increased expression of cell proliferation-associated genes including CCNB1, CCNB2, CDK1, AURKA, BIRC5 and DEPDC1. Knockdown of Pttg1 in 5TGM1 cells decreased cellular proliferation, without affecting cell cycle distribution or viability, and decreased expression of Ccnb1, Birc5 and Depdc1 in vitro. Notably, Pttg1 knockdown significantly reduced MM tumour development in vivo, with an 83.2&nbsp;% reduction in tumour burden at 4&nbsp;weeks (p &lt; 0.0001, two-way ANOVA.
y supports a role for increased PTTG1 expression in augmenting tumour development in a subset of MM patient.
 reason for the failure of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is the occurrence of chemoresistance to fluoropyrimidine (FU)-based chemotherapy. Various reports showed that ectopic expression and function of microRNAs (miRNAs) played key roles to mediate apoptosis at the post-transcriptional level. To further explore the possible mechanisms, we evaluated the prognostic effect of miR-218 in patients with CRC receiving 5-FU-based treatment and investigated the pro-apoptotic role of miR-218 in vitro. Primary tumour specimens and adjacent non-tumour sites were used to determine miR-218 expression distribution and explore its potential prognostic value in response to 5-FU-based treatment in patients with CRC. HCT116 and HT29 cells were transfected with precursor miR-218 or negative control, followed by assays to investigate its influence on apoptosis, cell proliferation and pathways involved in molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance to 5-FU. Results showed that high miR-218 expression was associated with positive response to first-line 5-FU treatment in CRC patients. MiR-218 promoted apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest in CRC cells by suppressing BIRC5 expression. Furthermore, miR-218 enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity in CRC cells by suppressing the 5-FU targeted enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS). In conclusion, we demonstrated that high miR-218 expression had a positive prognostic value in 5-FU-based treatments for CRC patients and discovered a novel mechanism mediated by miR-218 to promote apoptosis and to function synergistically with 5-FU to promote chemosensitivity by suppressing BIRC5 and TS in CRC. These suggest the unique potential of miR-218 as a novel candidate for developing miR-218-based therapeutic strategies in CR.
sis is vitally important in diabetic wound healing. We had previously demonstrated that a Chinese 2-herb formula (NF3) significantly stimulated angiogenesis of HUVEC in wound healing. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In line with this, global expression profiling of NF3-treated HUVEC was performed so as to assess the regulatory role of NF3 involved in the underlying signaling pathways in wound healing angiogenesis. The microarray results illustrated that different panels of differentially expressed genes were strictly governed in NF3-treated HUVEC in a time-regulated manner. The microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and western blotting verification of NF3-treated HUVEC at 6 h revealed the involvement of various genes in diverse biological process, e.g., MAP3K14 in anti-inflammation; SLC5A8 in anti-tumorogenesis; DNAJB7 in protein translation; BIRC5, EPCAM, INSL4, MMP8 and NPR3 in cell proliferation; CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1 and MMP8 in migration; CXCR7, EPCAM and MMP8 in tubular formation; and BIRC5, CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1, MMP8 and UBD in angiogenesis. After 16 h incubation of NF3, other sets of genes were shown with differential expression in HUVEC, e.g., IL1RAPL2 and NR1H4 in anti-inflammation; miR28 in anti-tumorogenesis; GRIN1 and LCN1 in anti-oxidation; EPB41 in intracellular signal transduction; PRL and TFAP2A in cell proliferation; miR28, PRL and SCG2 in cell migration; PRL in tubular formation; and miR28, NR1H4 and PRL in angiogenesis. This study provided concrete scientific evidence in support of the regulatory role of NF3 on endothelial cells involved in wound healing angiogenesi.
r activity of a novel curcumin analog (E)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-5-((E)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acryloyl)cyclopentanone (CUR3d) was studied using a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). The results showed that CUR3d completely inhibits the tumor cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CUR3d at 100&nbsp;μmol/L activated the pro-apoptotic caspase-3 along with downregulation of anti-apoptotic BIRC5 and Bcl2. CUR3d treatment controlled the cancer cell growth by downregulating the expression of PI3K/Akt (Akt1, Akt2) pathway along with NF-κB. CUR3d down-regulated the members of epidermal growth receptor family (EGFR, ERBB3, ERBB2) and insulin like growth receptors (IGF1, IGF-1R, IGF2). This correlated with the downregulation of G-protein (RHOA, RHOB) and RAS (ATF2, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) pathway signaling. CUR3d also arrested cell cycle via inhibition of CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK9, MDM2, MDM4 and TERT genes. Cell cycle essential aurora kinases (AURKα, AURKβ) and polo-like kinases (PLK1, PLK2, PLK3) were also modulated by CUR3d. Topoisomerases (TOP2α, TOP2β), important factors in cancer cell immortality, as well as HIF-1α were downregulated following CUR3d treatment. The expression of protein kinase-C family (PRKC-A, PRKC-D, PRKC-E) was also attenuated by CUR3d. The downregulation of histone deacetylases (Class I, II, IV) and PARP I further strengthened the anticancer efficacy of CUR3d. Downregulation of carcinogenic cathepsins (CTSB, CTSD) and heat shock proteins exhibited CUR3d's potency as a potential immunological adjuvant. Finally, the non-toxic manifestation of CUR3d in healthy liver and lung cells along with downregulation of drug resistant gene ABCC1 further warrant need for advance investigation.
gly, the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy agents for breast cancer has been related to changes in the genomic profile of tumors. We investigated correspondence between growth inhibitory concentrations of paclitaxel and gemcitabine (GI50) and gene copy number, mutation, and expression first in breast cancer cell lines and then in patients. Genes encoding direct targets of these drugs, metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and those previously associated with chemoresistance to paclitaxel (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;31 genes) or gemcitabine (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) were analyzed. A multi-factorial, principal component analysis (MFA) indicated expression was the strongest indicator of sensitivity for paclitaxel, and copy number and expression were informative for gemcitabine. The factors were combined using support vector machines (SVM). Expression of 15 genes (ABCC10, BCL2, BCL2L1, BIRC5, BMF, FGF2, FN1, MAP4, MAPT, NFKB2, SLCO1B3, TLR6, TMEM243, TWIST1, and CSAG2) predicted cell line sensitivity to paclitaxel with 82% accuracy. Copy number profiles of 3 genes (ABCC10, NT5C, TYMS) together with expression of 7 genes (ABCB1, ABCC10, CMPK1, DCTD, NME1, RRM1, RRM2B), predicted gemcitabine response with 85% accuracy. Expression and copy number studies of two independent sets of patients with known responses were then analyzed with these models. These included tumor blocks from 21 patients that were treated with both paclitaxel and gemcitabine, and 319 patients on paclitaxel and anthracycline therapy. A new paclitaxel SVM was derived from an 11-gene subset since data for 4 of the original genes was unavailable. The accuracy of this SVM was similar in cell lines and tumor blocks (70-71%). The gemcitabine SVM exhibited 62% prediction accuracy for the tumor blocks due to the presence of samples with poor nucleic acid integrity. Nevertheless, the paclitaxel SVM predicted sensitivity in 84% of patients with no or minimal residual diseas.
to assess the prognostic value of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
nce of CTC was evaluated in 62 patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas before systemic therapy and at follow-up through immunomagnetic enrichment for mucin 1- and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive cells, followed by real-time RT-PCR of the tumor-associated genes KRT19, MUC1, EPCAM, CEACAM5 and BIRC.
nts were stratified into groups according to CTC detection (CTC negative: with all marker genes negative; CTC positive: with at least 1 of the marker genes positive). Patients who were CTC positive at baseline had a significantly shorter median progression-free survival (PFS; 3.5 months, 95% CI: 2.9-4.2) and overall survival (OS; 5.8 months, 95% CI: 4.5-7.0) than patients lacking CTC (PFS 10.7 months, 95% CI: 6.9-14.4, p &lt; 0.001; OS 13.3 months, 95% CI: 8.0-18.6, p = 0.003). Alterations in the marker profile during the course of chemotherapy were not predictive of clinical outcome or response to therapy. Yet, a favorable clinical response depended significantly on CTC negativity (p = 0.03.
suggest that the presence of CTC is a major predictor of outcome in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal malignancie.
diphenyl ether (BDE-209) has been detected in human serum, semen, placenta, cord blood and milk worldwide. However, little is known regarding the potential effects on the early human embryonic development of BDE-209. In this study, human embryonic stem cell lines FY-hES-10 and FY-hES-26 were used to evaluate the potential effects and explore the toxification mechanisms using low-level BDE-209 exposure. Our data showed that BDE-209 exposure (1, 10 and 100 nM) reduced the expression of pluripotent genes such as OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG and induced human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) apoptosis. The downregulation of BIRC5/BCL2 and upregulation of BAX were related to apoptosis of hESCs induced by BDE-209 exposure. A mechanism study showed that OCT4 down-regulation accompanied by OCT4 promoter hypermethylation and increasing miR-145/miR-335 levels, OCT4 inhibitors. Moreover, BDE-209 could increase the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease SOD2 expression. The ROS increase and OCT4 downregulation after BDE-209 exposure could be reversed partly by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine supplement. These findings showed that BDE-209 exposure could decrease pluripotent genes expression via epigenetic regulation and induce apoptosis through ROS generation in human embryonic stem cells in vitro.

 of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are widely considered as promising cancer drug targets, especially for drug-resistant tumors. Mimicking the IAP-binding motif of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) is a rational strategy to design potential IAP inhibitors. In this report, we used the bioactive conformation of AVPI tetrapeptide in the N terminus of SMAC as a template and performed a shape-based virtual screening against a drug-like compound library to identify novel IAP inhibitors. Top hits were subsequently docked to available IAP crystal structures as a secondary screening followed by validation using in vitro biologic assays. Four novel hit compounds were identified to potently inhibit cell growth in two human melanoma (A375 and M14) and two human prostate (PC-3 and DU145) cancer cell lines. The best compound, UC-112 [5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)quinolin-8-ol], has IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 3.4 µM. UC-112 also potently inhibits the growth of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressed multidrug-resistant cancer cells, strongly activates caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activities, and selectively downregulates survivin level at a concentration as low as 1 µM. Coincubation of UC-112 with a known proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG-132) rescued survivin inhibition, consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action for UC-112. As a single agent, UC-112 strongly inhibits tumor growth and reduces both X chromosome-linked IAP and survivin levels in an A375 human melanoma xenograft model in vivo. Overall, our study identified novel scaffolds, especially UC-112, as new platforms on which potent and selective IAP antagonists can be develope.
nsic apoptotic pathway is characterized by the release of several mitochondrial intermembrane proteins into the cytosol of dying cells. It is unclear whether the release of these proteins follows a common or specific pathway. In the present report we show that survivin and, to a lesser extent, the survivin splice variant survivin DeltaEx3 regulate the specific liberation of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO), an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins binding protein, during apoptosis induced by etoposide, a DNA damaging agent. This antineoplastic drug induced posttranscriptional upregulation of survivin and survivin DeltaEx3. In turn, mitochondrial survivin associated with Smac/DIABLO, delaying its release. In addition, cytosolic survivin also stabilized the cytosolic levels of released Smac/DIABLO. These results provide an explanation for the observed differences in the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins in various apoptotic models and present a new mechanism for the anti-apoptotic effects of survivin in cancer cell.
 of apoptosis (IAP) proteins inhibit caspases, a function counteracted by IAP antagonists, insect Grim, HID, and Reaper and mammalian DIABLO/Smac. We now demonstrate that HtrA2, a mammalian homologue of the Escherichia coli heat shock-inducible protein HtrA, can bind to MIHA/XIAP, MIHB, and baculoviral OpIAP but not survivin. Although produced as a 50-kDa protein, HtrA2 is processed to yield an active serine protease with an N terminus similar to that of Grim, Reaper, HID, and DIABLO/Smac that mediates its interaction with XIAP. HtrA2 is largely membrane-associated in healthy cells, with a significant proportion observed within the mitochondria, but in response to UV irradiation, HtrA2 shifts into the cytosol, where it can interact with IAPs. HtrA2 can, like DIABLO/Smac, prevent XIAP inhibition of active caspase 3 in vitro and is able to counteract XIAP protection of mammalian NT2 cells against UV-induced cell death. The proapoptotic activity of HtrA2 in vivo involves both IAP binding and serine protease activity. Mutations of either the N-terminal alanine of mature HtrA2 essential for IAP interaction or the catalytic serine residue reduces the ability of HtrA2 to promote cell death, whereas a complete loss in proapoptotic activity is observed when both sites are mutate.
/CDK4 activity is upregulated in up to 50% of breast cancers and CDK4-mediated phosphorylation negatively regulates the TGFβ superfamily member Smad3. We sought to determine if CDK4 inhibition and doxorubicin chemotherapy could impact Smad3-mediated cell/colony growth and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Parental and cyclin D1-overexpressing MCF7 cells were treated with CDK4 inhibitor, doxorubicin, or combination therapy and cell proliferation, apoptosis, colony formation, and expression of apoptotic proteins were evaluated using an MTS assay, TUNEL staining, 3D Matrigel assay, and apoptosis array/immunoblotting. Study cells were also transduced with WT Smad3 or a Smad3 construct resistant to CDK4 phosphorylation (5M) and colony formation and expression of apoptotic proteins were assessed. Treatment with CDK4 inhibitor/doxorubicin combination therapy, or transduction with 5M Smad3, resulted in a similar decrease in colony formation. Treating cyclin D overexpressing breast cancer cells with combination therapy also resulted in the greatest increase in apoptosis, resulted in decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP, and impacted subcellular localization of pro-apoptotic Smac/DIABLO. Additionally, transduction of 5M Smad3 and doxorubicin treatment resulted in the greatest change in apoptotic protein expression. Collectively, this work showed the impact of CDK4 inhibitor-mediated, Smad3-regulated tumor suppression, which was augmented in doxorubicin-treated cyclin D-overexpressing study cell.
d mitochondria&#8209;derived activator of caspases (Smac), an antagonist of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), increases chemosensitivity in vitro. Survivin, an IAP family member, mediates cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. The present study investigated the correlation between Smac and survivin expression in primary breast cancer, and the sensitivity to anthracycline during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Pre&#8209;treatment biopsies and post&#8209;anthracycline treatment tumor sections were analyzed from 98 cases. Biomarker expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from clinical stage II and III anthracycline&#8209;based NAC&#8209;treated breast cancer. A univariate analysis indicated that the estrogen receptor (ER), Smac and survivin were significantly predictive of a pathological complete response (pCR) (P=0.004, 0.001 and 0.037, respectively) in pre&#8209;chemotherapy samples. ER, Smac and survivin expression was also significant for pCR on the multivariate analysis (P=0.001, 0.031 and 0.012, respectively). An inverse association was identified between survivin and Smac expression (r=&#8209;0.217, P=0.032; and r=&#8209;0.335, P=0.003, respectively) prior to and following NAC. The patients with low survivin expression or high Smac expression had significantly longer disease&#8209;free survival (DFS; P=0.012 and P=0.020, respectively) and overall survival (OS; P=0.01 and P=0.033, respectively) compared with the patients with high survivin or low Smac expression. Cox regression analyses demonstrated that survivin, Smac and clinical stage were independent predictors for DFS and OS. The present study indicated the significance of Smac and survivin in determining the breast cancer response to anthracycline&#8209;based chemotherapy, and may permit further stratifying of pre&#8209;chemotherapy patients to undertake more tailored treatment.
is a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family; its overexpression has been widely demonstrated to occur in various types of cancer. Overexpression of survivin also correlates with tumor progression and induces anticancer drug resistance. Interestingly, recent studies reveal that survivin exhibits multiple pro-mitotic and anti-apoptotic functions; the differential functions of survivin seem to be caused by differential subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and acetylation of this molecule. In this review, the complex expression regulations and post-translational modifications of survivin are discussed. This review also discusses how recent discoveries improve our understanding of survivin biology and also create opportunities for developing differential-functioned survivin-targeted therapy. Databases such as PubMed, Scopus® (Elsevier, New York, NY, USA), and SciFinder® (CAS, Columbus, OH, USA) were used to search for literature in the preparation of this revie.
 an inhibitor of apoptosis, regulates cell division and is a potential target for anticancer drugs because many cancers express high survivin levels. However, whether survivin would be toxic to human lung cells and tissues has not been determined. This report clarified the involvement of survivin in acute lung injury. We used immunohistochemical analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to study survivin expression and localization in injured mouse and human lungs. We also used cultured human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B and A549) to study survivin cytoprotection. Nuclei and cytoplasm of epithelial cells in day 3 and day 7 models of bleomycin-injured lung showed survivin-positive results, which is consistent with upregulated survivin mRNA expression. These nuclei also evidenced double positive findings for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and survivin. Day 7 models had similar Smac/DIABLO-positive and survivin-positive cell distributions. The cytoplasm and nuclei of epithelial cells in lesions with diffuse alveolar damage manifested strong survivin-positive findings. Bleomycin stimulation in both epithelial cell lines upregulated expression of survivin and apoptosis-related molecules. Suppression of survivin expression with small interfering RNA rendered human lung epithelial cells susceptible to bleomycin-induced damage, with markedly upregulated activation of caspase-3, caspase-7, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and lactate dehydrogenase activity and an increased number of dead cells compared with mock small interfering RNA-treated cells. Overexpression of survivin via transfection resulted in these epithelial cells being resistant to bleomycin-induced cell damage, with reduced activation of apoptosis-related molecules and lactate dehydrogenase activity and fewer dead cells compared with results for mock-transfected cells. Survivin, acting at the epithelial cell level that depends partly on apoptosis inhibition, is therefore a key mediator of cytoprotection in acute lung injury. Understanding the precise role of survivin in normal lung cells is required for the development of therapeutic survivi.
e the expression of Smac(second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase)and survivin on the growth, development, recurrence and carcinogenesis of the sinonasal inverted papilloma(NIP.
tochemical method was used to detective the expression of Smac and survivin in 10 cases of (nasal cavity mucosae, NM), 45 cases of NIP. The NIP group including 25 cases of NIP without dysplasia, 11 cases of NIP with dysplasia, and 9 cases of NIP with malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma(SCC.
sity of the positive expression of Smac in NIP was lower than NM, the intensity of the positive expression decreased with the decreasing degree of histological differentiation. There was significantly difference between NIP without dysplasia and SCC. The expression of survivin was negative in the control group, the expression intensity of NIP was enhanced. The degree of histological differentiation was lower, the intensity of the positive expression was higher. The expression between NIP without dysplasia and SCC had significantly differences. Smac negatively correlated with survivin(rs = -0.403, P&lt;0.01.
survivin were associated with the growth and carcinogenesis of NI.
s of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) can play an important role in inhibiting apoptosis by exerting their negative action on caspases (apoptotic proteins). There are eight proteins in this family: NAIP/BIRC1/NLRB, cellular IAP1 (cIAP1)/human IAP2/BIRC2, cellular IAP2 (cIAP2)/human IAP1/BIRC3, X-linked IAP (XIAP)/BIRC4, survivin/BIRC5, baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)-containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/apollon/BIRC6, livin/melanoma-IAP (ML-IAP)/BIRC7/KIAP, and testis-specific IAP (Ts-IAP)/hILP-2/BIRC8. Deregulation of these inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) may push cell toward cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) may provide new target for anticancer therapy. Drugs may be developed that are inhibiting these IAPs to induce apoptosis in cancerous cell.
toma are pediatric tumors of the sympathetic nervous system with a poor prognosis. Apoptosis is often deregulated in cancer cells, but only a few defects in apoptotic routes have been identified in neuroblastom.
nvestigated genomic aberrations affecting genes of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in neuroblastoma. We analyzed DNA profiling data (CGH and SNP arrays) and mRNA expression data of 31 genes of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dataset of 88 neuroblastoma tumors using the R2 bioinformatic platform ( http://r2.amc.nl). BIRC6 was selected for further analysis as a tumor driving gene. Knockdown experiments were performed using BIRC6 lentiviral shRNA and phenotype responses were analyzed by Western blot and MTT-assays. In addition, DIABLO levels and interactions were investigated with immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitatio.
ed frequent gain of the BIRC6 gene on chromosome 2, which resulted in increased mRNA expression. BIRC6 is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), that can bind and degrade the cytoplasmic fraction of the pro-apoptotic protein DIABLO. DIABLO mRNA expression was exceptionally high in neuroblastoma but the protein was only detected in the mitochondria. Upon silencing of BIRC6 by shRNA, DIABLO protein levels increased and cells went into apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed direct interaction between DIABLO and BIRC6 in neuroblastoma cell line.
ngs indicate that BIRC6 may have a potential oncogenic role in neuroblastoma by inactivating cytoplasmic DIABLO. BIRC6 inhibition may therefore provide a means for therapeutic intervention in neuroblastom.
eptor signaling pathway (NRSP) is increasingly linked to carcinogenesis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) appears to actively utilize this conserved developmental pathway. The aims of this study are to determine whether or not Notch 1-4 are overexpressed in NSCLC tissues compared with normal lung tissues and whether inhibiting NRSP could induce caspase-dependent or caspase-independent apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of Notch 1-4 in 101 NSCLC tissue samples and 30 normal lung tissue samples. DAPT was used to repress NRSP in SK-MES-1 cells. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V and PI staining. Cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) was measured by Western blot; X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and Survivin were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot; the release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) from mitochondria to cytoplasm was evaluated by Western blot; the subcellular locations of endonuclease G (Endo G) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) were observed by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence analysis. (Mech Dev, 98, 2000, 95) Notch 1-4 are up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and Notch 1, 2 are positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 106, 2009, 22293) DAPT treatment could inhibit NRSP and induce apoptosis, with a marked increase in cleaved PARP, decreases in XIAP and Survivin proteins and concomitant release of Smac, EndoG, and AIF from mitochondria, indicating that inhibiting NRSP by DAPT triggers caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosi.
e the effects of tumor-suppressing gene wild type PTEN on the cell proliferation, apoptosis and the possible regulations of apoptosis-related molecules Survivin, Xiap and Smac gene in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and cell line K562 cell.
ecombinant adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and PTEN (Ad-PTEN-GFP) or empty vector (Ad-GFP) was transfected into K562 cells. The growth of K562 cells was observed by MTT assay while cell cycle and apoptotic rate were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). PTEN, Survivin, Xiap and Smac mRNA levels were detected by real-time fluorescent relative-quantification reverse transcriptional PCR (FQ-PCR) while PTEN protein levels analyzed by Western blot. (2) The expression levels of PTEN, Survivin, Xiap and Smac mRNA were detected in 10 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CML-CP), 10 CML patients in blast crises (CML-BC) and 10 normal control marrow mononuclear cells (MMNC.
h of K562 cells was suppressed markedly. And the maximal growth inhibition rate was 38.6% after the transfection of PTEN. Survivin, Xiap, Smac mRNA expression levels were down-regulated by around 6.14, 7.44 and 2.95 folds respectively (0.0700 ± 0.0059, 0.0089 ± 0.0006, 0.0600 ± 0.0039 vs 0.4370 ± 0.0790, 0.0661 ± 0.0072, 0.1580 ± 0.0078 vs 0.4530 ± 0.0810, 0.0700 ± 0.0079, 0.1770 ± 0.0085, all P &lt; 0.01). The mRNA expression level of PTEN in CML-BC patients was lower than that in CML-CP patients and normal control. But Survivin, Xiap, Smac mRNA expression levels were higher in CML-BC patients than those in CML-CP and normal contro.
expression of PTEN gene may inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and promote cell apoptosis via the regulation of Survivin, Xiap and Smac gene.
is an inhibitor of apoptosis family protein implicated in apoptosis and mitosis. In apoptosis, it has been shown to recognize the Smac/DIABLO protein. It is also a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, a key player during mitosis. Recently, Survivin was identified in vitro and in vivo as the direct binding partner for phosphorylated Thr3 on histone H3 (H3T3ph). We have undertaken structural and binding studies to investigate the molecular basis underlying recognition of H3T3ph and Smac/DIABLO N-terminal peptides by Survivin. Our crystallographic studies establish recognition of N-terminal Ala in both complexes and identify intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions in the Survivin phosphate-binding pocket that contribute to H3T3ph mark recognition. In addition, our calorimetric data establish that Survivin binds tighter to the H3T3ph-containing peptide relative to the N-terminal Smac/DIABLO peptide, and this preference can be reversed through structure-guided mutations that increase the hydrophobicity of the phosphate-binding pocke.
an intimate relation between disturbance in survivin and SMAC/DIABLO expressions and cancer formation in many tissues; however, this was not confirmed in the primary breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between survivin and SMAC/DIABLO mRNA expressions in primary breast cancer using RT-PCR and their relationship to some of the risk factors (age, family history, breast-feeding, use of contraceptive pills and hormonal receptors). Breast cancer tissues were studied for the detection of the mRNA expression of survivin and SMAC/DIABLO. This was done by qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SMAC/DIABLO mRNA was detected by RT-PCR only in 1 sample in breast cancer tissues (6.25%). However, it was expressed in 16 out of 25 (64%) of the benign tumor tissues (P=0.00). In contrast, survivin mRNA was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, 36 out of 48 (75%) (P=0.00), while its expression was very low in benign tumor tissues, only 1 out of 37 (2.7%) (P=0.00). Expressions of SMAC/DIABLO and survivin were significantly reciprocal in breast cancer and benign tumor tissues. SMAC/DIABLO inhibits apoptosis of breast cancer cells by suppression of survivin. These two genes probably form an important link in the signaling pathway of formation of breast cancer cells, which may be chosen as therapeutic targets in the primary breast cance.
rvivin) is one of the genes located on chromosome arm 17q in the region that is often gained in neuroblastoma. BIRC5 is a protein in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway that interacts with XIAP and DIABLO leading to caspase-3 and caspase-9 inactivation. BIRC5 is also involved in stabilizing the microtubule-kinetochore dynamics. Based on the Affymetrix mRNA expression data, we here show that BIRC5 expression is strongly upregulated in neuroblastoma compared with normal tissues, adult malignancies, and non-malignant fetal adrenal neuroblasts. The over-expression of BIRC5 correlates with an unfavorable prognosis independent of the presence of 17q gain. Silencing of BIRC5 in neuroblastoma cell lines by various antisense molecules resulted in massive apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage and FACS analysis. As both the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the chromosomal passenger complex can be therapeutically targeted, we investigated in which of them BIRC5 exerted its essential anti-apoptotic role. Immunofluorescence analysis of neuroblastoma cells after BIRC5 silencing showed formation of multinucleated cells indicating mitotic catastrophe, which leads to apoptosis via P53 and CASP2. We show that BIRC5 silencing indeed resulted in activation of P53 and we could rescue apoptosis by CASP2 inhibition. We conclude that BIRC5 stabilizes the microtubules in the chromosomal passenger complex in neuroblastoma and that the apoptotic response results from mitotic catastrophe, which makes BIRC5 an interesting target for therap.
e the effects of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) on proliferation and apoptosis in gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 cells and the molecular mechanisms induced by ASOD.
ASODN-1, survivin ASODN-2 and survivin ASODN-3 were transfected into BGC-823 cells by Lipofectamine(TM) 2000 transfection reagent. The growth activity of BGC-823 cells was detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis index (AI), proliferation index (PI), cell cycle and expressions of survivin, VEGF and Smac/DIABLO proteins were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The changes of survivin mRNA, VEGF mRNA and Smac/DIABLO mRNA were detected by RT-PC.
ssion of survivin was down-regulated by the three ASODN sequences, especially the ASODN-2 was best. At 48 hours after transfection with 600 nmol/L survivin ASODN-2, the cells in G(1)/G(0) phase were significantly increased [(72.25 ± 2.95)%], apoptotic index increased [(11.31 ± 0.38)%], proliferation index decreased [(27.77 ± 2.97)%], compared with those in the control group [(56.25 ± 0.75)%, (1.62 ± 0.36)%, (43.80 ± 0.80)%, all P &lt; 0.05]. The survivin mRNA and protein levels (0.523 ± 0.091, 0.733 ± 0.009) were down-regulated compared with those in the control group (0.861 ± 0.047, 0.997 ± 0.233), VEGF (0.519 ± 0.076, 0.75 ± 0.006) were down-regulated compared with those in the control group (0.779 ± 0.059, 1.000 ± 0.01), while those of Smac/DIABLO(0.899 ± 0.113, 1.637 ± 0.023)were up-regulated compared with those in the control group (0.558 ± 0.041, 1.000 ± 0.049, all P &lt; 0.05.
ASODN can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 cells. Those effects are induced through up-regulation of Smac/DIABLO and down-regulation of survivin and VEGF expression simultaneousl.
e to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is a serious problem in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Using Western blot, real-time qRT-PCR and flow cytometry, we investigated the expression of survivin, Smac/DIABLO and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in patients with CML. Survivin overexpression has been associated with cancer progression, multidrug resistance, poor prognosis and short survival in several types of neoplasms including hematological malignancies. In this work, survivin expression was significantly elevated in late, in contrast to early, chronic phase CML (p=0.044). Patients with high or intermediate prognostic Sokal score presented higher survivin levels (p=0.012), as well as Smac/DIABLO levels (p=0.009) compared to low Sokal score. The strong correlation between survivin and Pgp expression in late (p=0.018), but not in early (p=0.5) chronic phase of CML, suggests that this association may play a biological role in late CML phase and may offer an important target for the development of new therapie.
was initially described as an inhibitor of apoptosis and attracted growing attention as one of the most tumor-specific genes in the human genome and a promising target for cancer therapy. Lately, it has been shown that survivin is a multifunctional protein that takes part in several crucial cell processes. At first, it was supposed that survivin functions only as a homodimer, but now data indicate that many processes require monomeric survivin. Moreover, recent studies reveal a special mechanism regulating the balance between monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein. In this paper we studied the mutant form of survivin that was unable to dimerize and investigated its role in apoptosis. We showed that survivin monomer interacts with Smac/DIABLO and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) both in vitro and in vivo. Due to this feature, it protects cells from caspase-dependent apoptosis even more efficiently than the wild-type survivin. We also identified that mutant monomeric survivin prevents apoptosis-inducing factor release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, protecting human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells from caspase-independent apoptosis. On the other hand, our results indicate that only wild-type survivin, but not the monomer mutant form, enhances tubulin stability in cells. These findings suggest that survivin partly performs its functions as a monomer and partly as a dimer. The mechanism of dimer-monomer balance regulation may also work as a &quot;switcher&quot; between survivin functions and thereby explain remarkable functional diversities of this protei.
mia is a promising treatment for human cervical cancer. However, little is known about whether and under what conditions heat treatment exerts tumor inhibition effects on cervical cancer, and the molecular mechanisms behind these cellular responses have yet to be elucidated. We employed the human cervical cancer cell line CaSki as a cellular model and examined the effect of cell apoptosis and proliferation under gradient thermal conditions (43, 45 and 47˚C for 40 min). Heat treatment was found to induce CaSki cell apoptosis and necrosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that cells were arrested in S phase upon the application of hyperthermia, and MTT analysis revealed that cell viability was also reduced. Of the thermal conditions, 45˚C exhibited the best induction of apoptosis, while 47˚C induced direct fierce necrosis. This was further demonstrated by examining the expression level of several key apoptosis-related genes: caspase-3, Smac and Survivin. During apoptosis, caspase-3 and Smac levels were up-regulated, whereas anti-apoptotic Survivin was down-regulated, enhancing programmed cell death. Our results reveal that heating at ≥45˚C induced cell apoptosis and necrosis, and inhibited cell proliferation at both the cellular and molecular levels. These findings support the use of hyperthermia in a clinical setting for the treatment of human cervical cance.
ike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) inhibits 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu)-induced apoptosis in esophageal carcinoma cells; however, the mechanisms for IGF-1-induced 5-Fu chemoresistance remain unknown. In the human esophageal carcinoma cell line, CE48T/VGH, we show that IGF-1 up-regulated survivin expression at the post-transcriptional level and this up-regulation is mediated by both the PI3-K/Akt and casein kinase 2 signaling pathways. We then examine whether IGF-1-induced 5-Fu chemoresistance is mediated through up-regulation of survivin. Ectopic expression of survivin inhibits 5-Fu-induced apoptosis; furthermore, the abolition of survivin expression sensitizes cells to 5-Fu treatment and prevents the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 in esophageal carcinoma cell lines. We also found that ectopic expression of survivin or treatment with IGF-1 inhibits the release of Smac/DIABLO and caspases activation after 5-Fu treatment. Our results strongly suggest that IGF-1 inhibits 5-Fu induced apoptosis through increasing survivin levels, which prevents Smac/DIABLO release and blocks the activation of caspases. Therefore, up-regulation of IGF-1 and survivin would seem to be responsible for 5-Fu chemoresistance in esophageal cancer patients and these factors may be the valuable predictors of 5-Fu chemoresistance in esophageal carcinom.
 as an apoptosis suppressor, exists as a homodimer interfacing at the N-terminal portion (residues 6-13) of its baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain and a linker segment (residues 89-102). Here we expressed full-length human Survivin (SurF) and a series of its mutants, SurΔN7, SurΔN13, and SurΔN18 with significant truncations of the N-terminus, all of which could still dimerize in solution. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was used to quantitate the unbinding forces of full-length and the mutant homodimers and revealed that the N-terminal residues up to Arg18 were not essential for dimerization. Meanwhile, the binding of SurΔN7 to Smac/DIABLO determined by ELISA was as efficient as the wild-type, but that of SurΔN13 was significantly reduced, and that of SurΔN18 was completely lost. Together, these findings provide direct evidence that the N-terminal sequence of Survivin is not critical for dimer formation but may contribute to correct folding and function of BI.
igate the expressions and significances of Survivin and Smac in ovarian mucinous tumor.
f 55 paraffin-embedded specimens of primary ovarian mucinous tumors were collected. SABC was used to detect protein expression of Survivin and Smac genes. Immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold labeling was performed to determine the subcellular localization and patterns of Smac protein expressio.
ytoplasmic expression rates of survivin in benign, borderline and malignant ovarian mucinous tumors were 2/20, 12/15 and 20/20 respectively, which presents an improving trend.There were significant differences of survivin expression between benign vs. borderline lesions (P &lt; 0.01), and benign vs. malignant tumors (P &lt; 0.01). The nuclear expression rates of survivin in benign, borderline and malignant ovarian mucinous tumors were 1/20, 6/15 and 5/20, respectively, which presents a.declining trend.There was significant difference of survivin expression between benign vs. borderline tumors (P &lt; 0.05). The positive expression rates of Smac among the three groups were 19/20, 9/15 and 3/20, respectively. There was significant difference among the three groups (P &lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.05). There was a negative correlation between Survivin and Smac (r = -0.153, P &lt; 0.01). (2) Colloidal gold labeling study demonstrated that mitochondrion intramembranous storage of Smac granules in the three groups were 24.1 ± 7.2, 11.1 ± 1.9 and 5.2 ± 1.7, respectively, and there were significant differences among the three groups (P &lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.05). The extramemebranous Smac granules were 4.7 ± 3.0, 2.9 ± 1.0 and 1.7 ± 1.3, although without significant difference among the three groups (P &gt; 0.05.
malignant development of ovarian mucinous tumors, the expressions of Survivin are up-regulated, and the expressions of Smac are down-regulated. Smac proteins exist mainly in an inactive intramembranous storage form inside of mitochondri.
apeutic resistance due to over expression of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) XIAP, survivin and livin has been observed in various cancers. In the current study, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for all three IAPs and a common ligand binding scaffold was identified. Further, a novel sequence based motif specific to these IAPs was designed. SMAC is an endogenous inhibitor of IAPs. Screening of ChemBank for compounds similar to lead SMAC-non-peptidomimetics yielded a cemadotin related compound NCIMech_000654. Cemadotin is a derivative of natural anti-tumor peptide dolastatin-15; hence these compounds were docked against all three IAPs. Based on our analysis, we propose that NCIMech_000654/dolastatin-15/cemadotin derivatives may be investigated for their potential in inhibiting XIAP, survivin and livi.
one (TQ), the predominant bioactive constituent derived from the medicinal spice Nigella sativa (also known as black cumin), has been applied for medical purposes for more than 2,000 years. Recent studies reported that thymoquinone exhibited inhibitory effects on the cell proliferation of several cancer cell lines. This study was performed to investigate the antitumor and anti-angiogenic effects of thymoquinone on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that thymoquinone induced a higher percentage of growth inhibition and apoptosis in the human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 compared to that of control, and thymoquinone significantly blocked human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. To investigate the possible mechanisms involved in these events, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and western blot analysis, and found that thymoquinone significantly downregulated NF-κB DNA-binding activity, XIAP, survivin and VEGF in SaOS-2 cells. Moreover, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Smac were upregulated in SaOS-2 cells after treatment with thymoquinone. In addition to these in vitro results, we also found that thymoquinone inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth through suppressing NF-κB and its regulated molecules. Collectively, our results demonstrate that thymoquinone effectively inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB and downstream effector molecules is a possible underlying mechanism of the antitumor and anti-angiogenic activity of thymoquinone in osteosarcom.
tochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) is a recently identified protein that is released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli and promotes apoptosis by antagonizing the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Our previous study showed that ectopic overexpression of Smac sensitizes drug-resistant tumor cells to TRAIL- or paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in vitro. The present study was designed to explore the effect of the synthesized Smac N7 peptide in a human ovarian cancer cell line and xenograft model. The results showed that the single-agent Smac N7 had a non-cytotoxic effect, but it effectively enhanced TRAIL- or paclitaxel-induced inhibition of cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, even in TRAIL-resistant A2780 cells. When Smac N7 was combined with TRAIL or paclitaxel in treating A2780 cell tumor xenografts, synergistic anticancer effects were achieved. Furthermore, the combination therapy caused less damage in normal tissues and more apoptosis in tumor xenografts compared with TRAIL or paclitaxel alone. Increased apoptosis was associated with the downregulation of XIAP, survivin and the increased activity of caspase-3, along with an increased amount of cleaved PARP. In conclusion, this Smac N7 peptide is a promising candidate for ovarian cancer combination therapy, and Smac may be the target for the development of a novel class of anticancer drug.
smonate (MJ) has recently attracted attention as a promising antitumoral compound because of its highly specific proapoptotic properties in a wide range of malignancies. However, the high doses required to achieve a therapeutic benefit have limited its clinical development. Here, we hypothesize that the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) may inhibit MJ-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. We combined MJ with the IAPs inhibitor, the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) peptide to treat bladder cancer cells. The results showed that the combination of MJ and Smac peptide enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect in a synergistic manner by releasing and activating IAPs-bounding caspase-3. These findings suggest that the inhibition of IAPs could overcome the resistance of cancer cells to M.
 genome-wide association study results for the levels of A1, A2 and fetal hemoglobins, analyzed for the first time concurrently. Integrating high-density array genotyping and whole-genome sequencing in a large general population cohort from Sardinia, we detected 23 associations at 10 loci. Five signals are due to variants at previously undetected loci: MPHOSPH9, PLTP-PCIF1, ZFPM1 (FOG1), NFIX and CCND3. Among the signals at known loci, ten are new lead variants and four are new independent signals. Half of all variants also showed pleiotropic associations with different hemoglobins, which further corroborated some of the detected associations and identified features of coordinated hemoglobin species productio.
microdeletion has been consistently associated with intellectual disability, overgrowth, and macrocephaly. We report a 19p13.13 microdeletion, detected by array CGH, in a girl with moderate intellectual disability, overgrowth with macrocephaly, prominent digit pads and deep digital creases, hypotonia, ataxia, and strabismus. This clinical report helps to delineate the role of some of the deleted genes, as well as the phenotype of recently described 19p13.13 microdeletion syndrome, including the description of novel digital abnormalities. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, In.
 years, there has been a surge of interest in the possibility of using machine-learning techniques to decode generating properties of eye-movement data (e.g., observer/stimulus-identity). Previous approaches have considered only aggregate or purely spatial measures of eye movements. Here we explore a relatively new approach to eye movement quantification, Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA)- which allows analysis of spatio-temporal fixation patterns -and assess its diagnostic power with respect to task decoding. Fifty participants completed both aesthetic-judgment and visual-search tasks over natural images of indoor scenes. Six different sets of features were extracted from the eye movement data: Aggregate (nFix, meanFixDur, meanSacAmp, area); fixMap (smoothed fixation map); RQA (recurrence, determinism, laminarity, center of recurrence mass); RQA2 (RQA features with the addition of size, regression, latency of recurrence mass); RQAprob (probabilistic version of RQA); RQAprob2 (probabilistic version of RQA2). These feature vectors were then used to train six separate support vector machines using an n-fold cross validation procedure in order to classify a scanpath as being generated under either an aesthetic-judgment or visual-search task. Analyses indicated that all classifiers decoded task significantly better than chance. Pairwise comparisons with Bonferonni-corrected alpha values revealed that all RQA feature sets afforded significantly greater decoding accuracy than the aggregate features. The superior performance of RQA features compared to the others may be that they are relatively invariant to changes in observer or stimulus; although RQA features significantly decoded observer- and stimulus-identity, analyses indicated that spatial distribution of fixations were most informative about stimulus-identity whereas aggregate measures were most informative about observer-identity. Therefore, changes in RQA values could be more confidently attributed to changes in task, rather than observer or stimulus, relative to the other feature sets. These findings have significant implications for the application of RQA in studying eye-movement dynamics in top-down attention. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 201.
oint mutations in NFIX gene have been reported so far, nine of them cause the Marshall-Smith syndrome (MSS) and the remaining mutations lead to an overgrowth disorder with a less severe phenotype, defined as Sotos-lik.
cal findings in three patients with MSS and two patients with a Sotos-like phenotype are presented. Analysis of the NFIX gene was performed both by conventional or next-generation sequencin.
ovo mutations in NFIX gene were identified, four of them not previously reported. Two frameshift mutations and a donor-splice one caused MSS, while two missense mutations in the DNA binding/dimerisation domain entailed an overgrowth syndrome with some clinical features resembling Sotos syndrome, accompanied by a marfanoid habitus, very low BMI, long narrow face, or arachnodactyl.
Smith mutations are scattered through exons 6-10 of NFIX gene, while most point mutations causing an overgrowth syndrome are clustered in exon 2. Clinical features of this overgrowth syndrome may well be considered an intermediate phenotype between Sotos and Marfan syndromes.Pediatric Research (2015); doi:10.1038/pr.2015.13.
ar Factor I-X (NFIX) is a member of the nuclear factor I (NFI) protein family and is deleted or mutated in a subset of patients with a peculiar overgrowth condition resembling Sotos Syndrome as well as in patients with Marshall-Smith syndrome. We identified three additional patients with this phenotype each carrying a different new mutation affecting the DNA-binding/dimerization domain of the NFIX protein. The present report further adds weight to the hypothesis that mutations in DNA-binding/dimerization domain are likely to cause haploinsufficiency of the NFIX protein and confirms that NFIX is the second gene that should be tested in individuals with overgrowth conditions resembling Sotos syndrome, previously tested negative for NSD1 mutations. We then propose to consider this overgrowth syndrome (namely Malan syndrome) and Marshall-Smith syndrome NFIX-related disease.
stnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes (OLs); however, our knowledge of the genes that control this lineage specification is incomplete. In this study, we show that nuclear factor I X (NFIX), a transcription factor known to regulate NSC quiescence, also suppresses oligodendrogenesis (ODG) from NSCs. Immunostaining reveals little or no expression of NFIX in OL lineage cells both in vivo and in vitro. Loss of NFIX from subventricular zone (SVZ) NSCs results in enhanced ODG both in vivo and in vitro, while forced expression of NFIX blocks NSC differentiation into OLs in vitro. RNA-seq analysis shows that genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in OL progenitors are significantly enriched in RNA from Nfix(-/-) versus wild-type NSCs. These data indicate that NFIX influences the lineage specification of postnatal SVZ NSCs, specifically suppressing OD.
in/paclitaxel (CP), with or without sorafenib, result in objective response rates of 18-20&nbsp;% in unselected chemotherapy-naïve patients. Molecular predictors of survival and response to CP-based chemotherapy in metastatic melanoma (MM) are critical to improving the therapeutic index. Intergroup trial E2603 randomized MM patients to CP with or without sorafenib. Expression data were collected from pre-treatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from 115 of 823 patients enrolled on E2603. The selected patients were balanced across treatment arms, BRAF status, and clinical outcome. We generated data using Nanostring array (microRNA (miRNA) expression) and DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation (DASL)/Illumina microarrays (HT12 v4) (mRNA expression) with protocols optimized for FFPE samples. Integrative computational analysis was performed using a novel Tree-guided Recursive Cluster Selection (T-ReCS) [1] algorithm to select the most informative features/genes, followed by TargetScan miRNA target prediction (Human v6.2) and mirConnX [2] for network inferenc.
entified PLXNB1 as negatively associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and miR-659-3p as the primary miRNA associated positively with PFS. miR-659-3p was differentially expressed based on PFS but not based on treatment arm, BRAF or NRAS status. Dichotomized by median PFS (less vs greater than 4 months), miR-659-3p expression was significantly different. High miR-659-3p expression distinguished patients with responsive disease (complete or partial response) from patients with stable disease. miR-659-3p predicted gene targets include NFIX, which is a transcription factor known to interact with c-Jun and AP-1 in the context of developmental processes and diseas.
l integrative analysis implicates miR-659-3p as a candidate predictive biomarker for MM patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and may serve to improve patient selectio.
ar factor I/X (NFIX) is a member of NFI family and contributes to muscle and brain development. Numerous genes coding for alternative splicing isoforms play potential but different roles in the biological process. To date, transcript variants of NFIX gene and their expression profiles have never been elucidated in dairy goat. Herein, we identified and verified the expression of two novel transcripts (NFIXa and NFIXb) of NFIX gene in dairy goat. Compared with the normal transcript (NFIX), the NFIXa variant lacked the first and ninth exons, while the NFIXb variant lacked the first, seventh and ninth exons; the NFIXa variant was 69 nt longer than the normal transcript in the 5' end site of the seventh exon, while the NFIXb variant was 66 nt longer in the 5' end site of the seventh exon. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression levels of the three variants were significantly different. The normal NFIX variant was abundantly expressed in the lungs, the NFIXa variant was highly expressed in the pancreas, and the NFIXb variant was abundantly expressed in both the lung and the pancreas. Additionally, the NFIXa variant showed a significantly higher expression level than those of the normal NFIX and the alternative NFIXb variants in the liver, spleen, adipose, intestine and the testis (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05), respectively. Expression of the NFIXa variant in the brain was significantly higher than that of the NFIXb variant (P&lt;0.01). These findings suggest that the NFIXa isoform is the most abundant isoform in certain tissues of the dairy goat. This study represents the first report on alternative splicing variants of the goat NFIX gene and their expression profiles. It should help elucidate the function of NFIX gene in dairy goa.
actor one X (NFIX) has been shown to play a pivotal role during the development of many regions of the brain, including the neocortex, the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Mechanistically, NFIX has been shown to promote neural stem cell differentiation through the activation of astrocyte-specific genes and via the repression of genes central to progenitor cell self-renewal. Interestingly, mice lacking Nfix also exhibit other phenotypes with respect to development of the central nervous system, and whose underlying causes have yet to be determined. Here we examine one of the phenotypes displayed by Nfix(-/-) mice, namely hydrocephalus. Through the examination of embryonic and postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice we reveal that hydrocephalus is first seen at around postnatal day (P) 10 in mice lacking Nfix, and is fully penetrant by P20. Furthermore, we examined the subcommissural organ (SCO), the Sylvian aqueduct and the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles, regions that when malformed and functionally perturbed have previously been implicated in the development of hydrocephalus. SOX3 is a factor known to regulate SCO development. Although we revealed that NFIX could repress Sox3-promoter-driven transcriptional activity in vitro, SOX3 expression within the SCO was normal within Nfix(-/-) mice, and Nfix mutant mice showed no abnormalities in the structure or function of the SCO. Moreover, these mutant mice exhibited no overt blockage of the Sylvian aqueduct. However, the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles was frequently absent in Nfix(-/-) mice, suggesting that this phenotype may underlie the development of hydrocephalus within these knockout mic.
al age (GA) and birth weight have been implicated in the determination of long-term health. It has been hypothesized that changes in DNA methylation may mediate these long-term effects. We obtained DNA methylation profiles from cord blood and peripheral blood at ages 7 and 17 in the same children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Repeated-measures data were used to investigate changes in birth-related methylation during childhood and adolescence. Ten developmental phenotypes (e.g. height) were analysed to identify possible mediation of health effects by DNA methylation. In cord blood, methylation at 224 CpG sites was found to be associated with GA and 23 CpG sites with birth weight. Methylation changed in the majority of these sites over time, but neither birth characteristic was strongly associated with methylation at age 7 or 17 (using a conservative correction for multiple testing of P &lt; 1.03 × 10(-7)), suggesting resolution of differential methylation by early childhood. Associations were observed between birth weight-associated CpG sites and phenotypic characteristics in childhood. One strong association involved birth weight, methylation of a CpG site proximal to the NFIX locus and bone mineral density at age 17. Analysis of serial methylation from birth to adolescence provided evidence for a lack of persistence of methylation differences beyond early childhood. Sites associated with birth weight were linked to developmental genes and have methylation levels which are associated with developmental phenotypes. Replication and interrogation of causal relationships are needed to substantiate whether methylation differences at birth influence the association between birth weight and developmen.
tment of stem and progenitor cells toward specific hematopoietic lineages is tightly controlled by a number of transcription factors that regulate differentiation programs via the expression of lineage restricting genes. Nuclear factor one (NFI) transcription factors are important in regulating hematopoiesis and here we report an important physiological role of NFIX in B- and myeloid lineage commitment and differentiation. We demonstrate that NFIX acts as a regulator of lineage specification in the haematopoietic system and the expression of Nfix was transcriptionally downregulated as B cells commit and differentiate, whilst maintained in myeloid progenitor cells. Ectopic Nfix expression in vivo blocked early B cell development stage, coincident with the stage of its downregulation. Furthermore, loss of Nfix resulted in the perturbation of myeloid and lymphoid cell differentiation, and a skewing of gene expression involved in lineage fate determination. Nfix was able to promote myeloid differentiation of total bone marrow cells under B cell specific culture conditions but not when expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSPC), consistent with its role in HSPC survival. The lineage choice determined by Nfix correlated with transcriptional changes in a number of genes, such as E2A, C/EBP, and Id genes. These data highlight a novel and critical role for NFIX transcription factor in hematopoiesis and in lineage specificatio.
with microdeletions in the 19p13.2 chromosomal region show developmental delays, overgrowth, and distinctive features with big head appearances. These manifestations are now recognized as Sotos syndrome-like features (Sotos syndrome 2) or Malan syndrome. We identified three female patients with 19p13.2 deletions involving NFIX, a gene responsible for Malan syndrome. We compared the genotypic and phenotypic data of these patients with those of the patients previously reported. The most of the clinical features were found to overlap; however, Chiari malformation type I was observed in two of the three patients evaluated in this study. Because Chiari malformation type I has never been reported in the patients with NSD1-related Sotos syndrome, this finding indicates the possible role of 19p13.2 deletion in patients with mimicking features of Sotos syndrome but have negative NSD1 testing result.
drome, described in 1964, was characterized by overgrowth, a distinctive craniofacial configuration, and a non-progressive neurological disorder with mental retardation. There have been many developments since then and an update should be informative. The syndrome is associated with a number of abnormalities: brain, cardiac, urogenital, musculoskeletal (scoliosis), ophthalmologic, dental and neoplastic. It is a genetic disorder due to haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene (Nuclear receptor-binding SET Domain protein 1) on chromosome 5q35.2-35.3 in 90% of the patients: Sotos syndrome 1. Recently, heterozygous mutations in the NFIX gene (Nuclear Factor I, X type) on chromosome 19p13.3 were identified in a few children with the Sotos syndrome phenotype: Sotos syndrome 2. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been obtained. Many studies have been conducted to find out the functional pathway and the manner that the mutated genes altered transcription of other genes and the interaction with other proteins to generate the phenotype, but the functional pathway is largely unknow.
tion factors of the nuclear factor one (NFI) family play a pivotal role in the development of the nervous system. One member, NFIX, regulates the development of the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice also display abnormalities within the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles, a region of the brain comprising a neurogenic niche that provides ongoing neurogenesis throughout life. Specifically, Nfix(-/-) mice exhibit more PAX6-expressing progenitor cells within the SVZ. However, the mechanism underlying the development of this phenotype remains undefined. Here, we reveal that NFIX contributes to multiple facets of SVZ development. Postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice exhibit increased levels of proliferation within the SVZ, both in vivo and in vitro as assessed by a neurosphere assay. Furthermore, we show that the migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts to the olfactory bulb is impaired, and that the olfactory bulbs of postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice are smaller. We also demonstrate that gliogenesis within the rostral migratory stream is delayed in the absence of Nfix, and reveal that Gdnf (glial-derived neurotrophic factor), a known attractant for SVZ-derived neuroblasts, is a target for transcriptional activation by NFIX. Collectively, these findings suggest that NFIX regulates both proliferation and migration during the development of the SVZ neurogenic nich.
onoallelic variants in NFIX cause two distinct syndromes. Whole gene deletions, nonsense variants and missense variants affecting the DNA-binding domain have been seen in association with a Sotos-like phenotype that we propose is referred to as Malan syndrome. Frameshift and splice-site variants thought to avoid nonsense-mediated RNA decay have been seen in Marshall-Smith syndrome. We report six additional patients with Malan syndrome and de novo NFIX deletions or sequence variants and review the 20 patients now reported. The phenotype is characterised by moderate postnatal overgrowth and macrocephaly. Median height and head circumference in childhood are 2.0 and 2.3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean, respectively. There is overlap of the facial phenotype with NSD1-positive Sotos syndrome in some cases including a prominent forehead, high anterior hairline, downslanting palpebral fissures and prominent chin. Neonatal feeding difficulties and/or hypotonia have been reported in 30% of patients. Developmental delay/learning disability have been reported in all cases and are typically moderate. Ocular phenotypes are common, including strabismus (65%), nystagmus (25% ) and optic disc pallor/hypoplasia (25%). Other recurrent features include pectus excavatum (40%) and scoliosis (25%). Eight reported patients have a deletion also encompassing CACNA1A, haploinsufficiency of which causes episodic ataxia type 2 or familial hemiplegic migraine. One previous case had episodic ataxia and one case we report has had cyclical vomiting responsive to pizotifen. In individuals with this contiguous gene deletion syndrome, awareness of possible later neurological manifestations is important, although their penetrance is not yet clea.
ave indicated that altered maternal micronutrients and vitamins influence the development of newborns and altered nutrient exposure throughout the lifetime may have potential health effects and increased susceptibility to chronic diseases. In recent years, folic acid (FA) exposure has significantly increased as a result of mandatory FA fortification and supplementation during pregnancy. Since FA modulates DNA methylation and affects gene expression, we investigated whether the amount of FA ingested during gestation alters gene expression in the newborn cerebral hemisphere, and if the increased exposure to FA during gestation and throughout the lifetime alters behavior in C57BL/6J mic.
 fed FA either at 0.4 mg or 4 mg/kg diet throughout the pregnancy and the resulting pups were maintained on the diet throughout experimentation. Newborn pups brain cerebral hemispheres were used for microarray analysis. To confirm alteration of several genes, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses were performed. In addition, various behavior assessments were conducted on neonatal and adult offsprin.
rom microarray analysis suggest that the higher dose of FA supplementation during gestation alters the expression of a number of genes in the newborns' cerebral hemispheres, including many involved in development. QRT-PCR confirmed alterations of nine genes including down-regulation of Cpn2, Htr4, Zfp353, Vgll2 and up-regulation of Xist, Nkx6-3, Leprel1, Nfix, Slc17a7. The alterations in the expression of Slc17a7 and Vgll2 were confirmed at the protein level. Pups exposed to the higher dose of FA exhibited increased ultrasonic vocalizations, greater anxiety-like behavior and hyperactivity. These findings suggest that although FA plays a significant role in mammalian cellular machinery, there may be a loss of benefit from higher amounts of FA. Unregulated high FA supplementation during pregnancy and throughout the life course may have lasting effects, with alterations in brain development resulting in changes in behavio.
 clinical and molecular cytogenetic characterization of a 2&nbsp;year-old girl with 19p13.2p13.12 microdeletion and compare her clinical features with those of three other patients reported befor.
parative genomic hybridization (aCGH) revealed in the present patient a de novo microdeletion of 1.45&nbsp;Mb within 19p13.2p13.12. The deletion includes seven OMIM genes: MAN2B1, RNASEH2A, KLF1, GCDH, NFIX, CACNA1A and CC2D1.
nt case and three other patients with partially overlapping 19p13 microdeletion share the following features: psychomotor and language delay, intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia, skeletal anomalies and facial dysmorphism. The smallest region of overlapping between all four reported patients is around 300&nbsp;kb and spans only two genes: NFIX and CACNA1A. Their haploinsufficincy could be the base for the phenotype -genotype correlatio.
Smith syndrome (MSS) is a very rare malformation syndrome characterized by typical craniofacial anomalies, abnormal osseous maturation, developmental delay, failure to thrive, and respiratory difficulties. Mutations in the nuclear factor 1/X gene (NFIX) were recently identified as the cause of MSS. In our study cohort of 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MSS, conventional sequencing of NFIX revealed frameshift and splice-site mutations in 10 individuals. Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, we identified a recurrent deletion of NFIX exon 6 and 7 in five individuals. We demonstrate this recurrent deletion is the product of a recombination between AluY elements located in intron 5 and 7. Two other patients had smaller deletions affecting exon 6. These findings show that MSS is a genetically homogeneous Mendelian disorder. RT-PCR experiments with newly identified NFIX mutations including the recurrent exon 6 and 7 deletion confirmed previous findings indicating that MSS-associated mutant mRNAs are not cleared by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Predicted MSS-associated mutant NFIX proteins consistently have a preserved DNA binding and dimerization domain, whereas they grossly vary in their C-terminal portion. This is in line with the hypothesis that MSS-associated mutations encode dysfunctional proteins that act in a dominant negative manne.
identify a role for the matrilin-2 (Matn2) extracellular matrix protein in controlling the early stages of myogenic differentiation. We observed Matn2 deposition around proliferating, differentiating and fusing myoblasts in culture and during muscle regeneration in vivo. Silencing of Matn2 delayed the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and of the myogenic genes Nfix, MyoD and Myog, explaining the retarded cell cycle exit and myoblast differentiation. Rescue of Matn2 expression restored differentiation and the expression of p21 and of the myogenic genes. TGF-β1 inhibited myogenic differentiation at least in part by repressing Matn2 expression, which inhibited the onset of a positive-feedback loop whereby Matn2 and Nfix activate the expression of one another and activate myoblast differentiation. In vivo, myoblast cell cycle arrest and muscle regeneration was delayed in Matn2(-/-) relative to wild-type mice. The expression levels of Trf3 and myogenic genes were robustly reduced in Matn2(-/-) fetal limbs and in differentiating primary myoblast cultures, establishing Matn2 as a key modulator of the regulatory cascade that initiates terminal myogenic differentiation. Our data thus identify Matn2 as a crucial component of a genetic switch that modulates the onset of tissue repai.
f this study was to detect splicing variants of the bovine NFIX gene and determine their expression regulations. Through bioinformatics analysis, we predicted five isoforms of the bovine NFIX transcript product and validated their existence using cDNA pool and sequencing methods. The five isoforms had a common 5'-terminal sequence and various 3'-terminal sequences. Nuclear factor I family genes can activate or repress transcription by a highly variable C-terminal region. Thus, the five isoform products from a single gene may function differently. Quantitative PCR results showed that NFIX had highest expression in brain; medial expression in lung and muscle; and lower expression in spleen, kidney, liver and heart of both embryo and adult cattle. However, the expression levels NFIX in adult tissues were significantly decreased, and the diversity of its alternative splicing events was lower. Each isoform was expressed differently in different tissues at the embryo and adult stages. One of the isoforms (Nfix2) was not detected in tissues of adult cattle. In brain, another of the isoforms (Nfix3) was not detected, whereas the other four isoforms were highly expressed. In the embryo, of the five isoforms, the profile of the one labeled Nfix4 was the most similar to that of total Nfix, and we proved that it was the major isoform. This study is the first that has detected five novel isoforms of the bovine NFIX transcript products and that has examined their profiles at spatial and temporal levels, which will provide essential information for better understanding the bovine NFIX gen.
tion of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression is mediated by three DNA elements in the promoters of these genes (W, X, and Y boxes). The Y box contains an inverted CCAAT box sequence, and the binding activity to the CAAT box is mediated by factor NF-Y, which is composed of subunits NF-YA and NF-YB. We have found that transfection of either dbpA or dbpB (mYB-1) or both inhibits I-A beta gene expression. Although the genes for some members of the Y-box family of binding proteins have been isolated by screening an expression library using the Y-box sequence, under our conditions no binding of dbpA or dbpB to the Y box of the I-A beta or I-E alpha promoter was detected. This suggested that repression of I-A beta gene expression by dbpA and dbpB was not due to competition for binding to the Y-box sequence. The results suggest two other mechanisms by which dbpA and dbpB can inhibit transcription from the I-A beta promoter. When dbpA was added, the binding of NF-YA to DNA increased, which could be explained by interaction between these two proteins whose purpose is to increase the binding affinity of NF-YA for DNA. However, this complex was unable to stimulate transcription from the I-A beta promoter. Thus, dbpA competed for the interaction between NF-YA and NF-YB by binding to NF-YA. When dbpB factor was added together with NF-YA and NF-YB, the binding of the NF-YA--NF-YB complex was reduced. This suggested that dbpB may complete with NF-YB for interaction with NF-YA. These results provide an example of how dbpA and dbpB may regulate transcription of promoters that utilize NF-Y as a transcription facto.
ike growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) is expressed in many cell types including osteoblasts and modulates IGF activities. IGFBP5 may affect osteoblasts and bone formation, in part by mechanisms independent of binding IGFs. The highly conserved IGFBP5 proximal promoter within 100 nucleotides of the start of transcription contains functional cis regulatory elements for C/EBP, Myb and AP-2. We report evidence for a functional Nuclear Factor I (NFI) cis element that mediates activation or repression of IGFBP5 transcription by the NFI gene family. All four NFI genes were expressed in human osteoblast cultures and osteosarcoma cell lines. Co-transfection with human IGFBP5 promoter luciferase reporter and murine Nfi expression vectors showed that Nfib was the most active in stimulating transcription. Nfix was less active and Nfia and Nfic were inhibitory. Knockdown of NFIB and NFIC expression using siRNA decreased and increased IGFBP5 expression, respectively. Analysis of IGFBP5 promoter deletion and mutation reporter constructs identified a functional NFI cis element. All four NFI proteins bound the NFI site in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments and NFIB bound in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Results suggest that NFI proteins are important regulators of IGFBP5 expression in human osteoblasts and thus in modulating IGFBP5 functions in bon.
of U937 human leukemic cells to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induces their differentiation into monocyte/macrophage-like cells. This terminal differentiation is associated with a resistant phenotype to apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. The inhibition occurs upstream of the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the activation of procaspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9. By using cell-free systems, it was demonstrated that the mitochondrial pathway to cell death that involves mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release and cytosolic activation of procaspases by cytochrome c/dATP remains functional in TPA-differentiated U937 cells. Accordingly, 2 drugs recently shown to target the mitochondria, namely lonidamine and arsenic trioxide, bypass the resistance of TPA-differentiated U937 cells to classical anticancer drugs. Cell death induced by the 2 compounds is associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from the mitochondria, activation of caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the decreased glutathione content associated with the differentiation process amplifies the ability of arsenic trioxide to activate the mitochondrial pathway to cell death. Similar results were obtained by comparing undifferentiated and TPA-differentiated human HL60 leukemic cells. These data demonstrate that mitochondria-targeting agents bypass the resistance to classical anticancer drugs induced by TPA-mediated leukemic cell differentiation. (Blood. 2001;97:3931-394.
ria are known to be involved in the early stage of apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c, caspase-9, and the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac). We have reported that overexpression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) reduced superoxide production and ameliorated neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 subregion after global ischemia. However, the role of oxygen free radicals produced after ischemia/reperfusion in the mitochondrial signaling pathway has not been clarified. Five minutes of global ischemia was induced in male SOD1-transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (Wt) littermate rats. Cytosolic expression of cytochrome c and Smac and activation of caspases were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and caspase activity assay. Apoptotic cell death was characterized by DNA nick end and single-stranded DNA labeling. In the Wt animals, early superoxide production, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, Smac, and cleaved caspase-9 were observed after ischemia. Active caspase-3 was subsequently increased, and 85% of the hippocampal CA1 neurons showed apoptotic DNA damage 3 d after ischemia. Tg animals showed less superoxide production and cytochrome c and Smac release. Subsequent active caspase-3 expression was not evident, and only 45% of the neurons showed apoptotic DNA damage. A caspase-3 inhibitor (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-val-ala-asp-fluoromethyl ketone) reduced cell death only in Wt animals. These results suggest that overexpression of SOD1 reduced oxidative stress, thereby attenuating the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac, resulting in less caspase activation and apoptotic cell death. Oxygen free radicals may play a pivotal role in the mitochondrial signaling pathway of apoptotic cell death in hippocampal CA1 neurons after global ischemi.
ossypium spp.) is widely cultivated due to the important economic value of its fiber. However, extreme environmental degradation impedes cotton growth and production. Receptor-like kinase (RLK) proteins play important roles in signal transduction and participate in a diverse range of processes in response to plant hormones and environmental cues. Here, we introduced an RLK gene (GbRLK) from cotton into Arabidopsis and investigated its role in imparting abiotic stress toleranc.
nscription was induced by exogenously supplied abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, mock drought conditions and high salinity. We cloned the promoter sequence of this gene via self-formed adaptor PCR. Sequence analysis revealed that the promoter region contains many cis-acting stress-responsive elements such as ABRE, W-Box, MYB-core, W-Box core, TCA-element and others. We constructed a vector containing a 1,890-bp sequence in the 5' region upstream of the initiation codon of this promoter and transformed it into Arabidopsis thaliana. GUS histochemical staining analysis showed that GbRLK was expressed mainly in leaf veins, petioles and roots of transgenic Arabidopsis, but not in the cotyledons or root hairs. GbRLK promoter activity was induced by ABA, PEG, NaCl and Verticillium dahliae. Transgenic Arabidopsis with constitutive overexpression of GbRLK exhibited a reduced rate of water loss in leaves in vitro, along with improved salinity and drought tolerance and increased sensitivity to ABA compared with non-transgenic Col-0 Arabidopsis. Expression analysis of stress-responsive genes in GbRLK Arabidopsis revealed that there was increased expression of genes involved in the ABA-dependent signaling pathway (AtRD20, AtRD22 and AtRD26) and antioxidant genes (AtCAT1, AtCCS, AtCSD2 and AtCSD1) but not ion transporter genes (AtNHX1, AtSOS1.
involved in the drought and high salinity stresses pathway by activating or participating in the ABA signaling pathway. Overexpression of GbRLK may improve stress tolerance by regulating stress-responsive genes to reduce water loss. GbRLK may be employed in the genetic engineering of novel cotton cultivars in the future. Further studying of GbRLK will help elucidate abiotic stress signaling pathway.
umber of stress-responsive genes, such as those of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase complex, are encoded by both the nucleus and mitochondria. The regulatory mechanism of these joint products is mysterious. The expression of 6-kDa subunit (MtATP6), a relatively uncharacterized nucleus-encoded subunit of F0 part, was measured during salinity stress in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivated wheat genotypes, as well as in the wild wheat genotypes, Triticum and Aegilops using qRT-PCR. The MtATP6 expression was suddenly induced 3 h after NaCl treatment in all genotypes, indicating an early inducible stress-responsive behavior. Promoter analysis showed that the MtATP6 promoter includes cis-acting elements such as ABRE, MYC, MYB, GTLs, and W-boxes, suggesting a role for this gene in abscisic acid-mediated signaling, energy metabolism, and stress response. It seems that 6-kDa subunit, as an early response gene and nuclear regulatory factor, translocates to mitochondria and completes the F1F0-ATP synthase complex to enhance ATP production and maintain ion homeostasis under stress conditions. These communications between nucleus and mitochondria are required for inducing mitochondrial responses to stress pathways. Dual targeting of 6-kDa subunit may comprise as a mean of inter-organelle communication and save energy for the cell. Interestingly, MtATP6 showed higher and longer expression in the salt-tolerant wheat and the wild genotypes compared to the salt-sensitive genotype. Apparently, salt-sensitive genotypes have lower ATP production efficiency and weaker energy management than wild genotypes; a stress tolerance mechanism that has not been transferred to cultivated genotype.
ve developed certain adaptive responses to environmental stresses that cause adverse effects on growth. To identify genes involved in the adaptive mechanisms, we constructed a large population of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing rice full-length cDNAs, and performed gain-of-function screening under high-salinity stress. In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, JAmyb, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity. JAmyb overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation. In rice seedlings, JAmyb expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that JAmyb is responsible for abiotic stress response. Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of JAmyb stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis. Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by JAmyb. JAmyb has been reported to be associated with disease response. Our observations suggest that JAmyb plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in ric.
tome of Glycine soja leaf tissue during a detailed time course formed a foundation for examining transcriptional processes during NaHCO(3) stress treatment. Of a total of 2,310 detected differentially expressed genes, 1,664 genes were upregulated and 1,704 genes were downregulated at various time points. The number of stress-regulated genes increased dramatically after a 6-h stress treatment. GO category gene enrichment analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes were involved in cell structure, protein synthesis, energy, and secondary metabolism. Another enrichment test revealed that the response of G. soja to NaHCO(3) highlights specific transcription factors, such as the C2C2-CO-like, MYB-related, WRKY, GARP-G2-like, and ZIM families. Co-expressed genes were clustered into ten classes (P &lt; 0.001). Intriguingly, one cluster of 188 genes displayed a unique expression pattern that increases at an early stage (0.5 and 3&nbsp;h), followed by a decrease from 6 to 12&nbsp;h. This group was enriched in regulation of transcription components, including AP2-EREBP, bHLH, MYB/MYB-related, C2C2-CO-like, C2C2-DOF, C2C2, C3H, and GARP-G2-like transcription factors. Analysis of the 1-kb upstream regions of transcripts displaying similar changes in abundance identified 19 conserved motifs, potential binding sites for transcription factors. The appearance of ABA-responsive elements in the upstream of co-expression genes reveals that ABA-mediated signaling participates in the signal transduction in alkaline respons.
oton exchangers (NHX) are key players in the plant response to salinity and have a central role in establishing ion homeostasis. NHXs can be localized in the tonoplast or plasma membranes, where they exchange sodium ions for protons, resulting in sodium ions being removed from the cytosol into the vacuole or extracellular space. The expression of most plant NHX genes is modulated by exposure of the organisms to salt stress or water stress. We explored the regulation of the vacuolar NHX1 gene from the salt-tolerant sugar beet plant (BvNHX1) using Arabidopsis plants transformed with an array of constructs of BvHNX1::GUS, and the expression patterns were characterized using histological and quantitative assays. The 5 UTR of BvNHX1, including its intron, does not modulate the activity of the promoter. Serial deletions show that a 337 bp promoter fragment sufficed for driving activity that indistinguishable from that of the full-length (2,464 bp) promoter. Mutating four putative cis-acting elements within the 337 bp promoter fragment revealed that MYB transcription factor(s) are involved in the activation of the expression of BvNHX1 upon exposure to salt and water stresses. Gel mobility shift assay confirmed that the WT but not the mutated MYB binding site is bound by nuclear protein extracted from salt-stressed Beta vulgaris leave.
ransport undergoes an adaptive response to changes in taurine availability. Unlike most amino acids, taurine is not metabolized or incorporated into protein but remains free in the intracellular water. Most amino acids are reabsorbed at rates of 98-99%, but reabsorption of taurine may range from 40% to 99.5%. Factors that influence taurine accumulation include ionic environment, electrochemical charge, and post-translational and transcriptional factors. Among these are protein kinase C (PKC) activation and transactivation or repression by proto-oncogenes such as WT1, c-Jun, c-Myb and p53. Renal adaptive regulation of the taurine transporter (TauT) was studied in vivo and in vitro. Site-directed mutagenesis and the oocyte expression system were used to study post-translational regulation of the TauT by PKC. Reporter genes and Northern and Western blots were used to study transcriptional regulation of the taurine transporter gene (TauT). We demonstrated that (i) the body pool of taurine is controlled through renal adaptive regulation of TauT in response to taurine availability; (ii) ionic environment, electrochemical charge, pH, and developmental ontogeny influence renal taurine accumulation; (iii) the fourth segment of TauT is involved in the gating of taurine across the cell membrane, which is controlled by PKC phosphorylation of serine 322 at the post-translational level; (iv) expression of TauT is repressed by the p53 tumour suppressor gene and is transactivated by proto-oncogenes such as WT1, c-Jun, and c-Myb; and (v) over-expression of TauT protects renal cells from cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicit.
ide (NO) is an unstable free radical gas known as an effector molecule of macrophage cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Although several mechanisms of NO-mediated cytotoxicity have been proposed, this phenomenon remains to be characterized in detail. To explore the mechanisms by which NO kills cancer cells, we made use of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which releases NO in the culture medium. SNP showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on NA cells, an epithelial cancer cell line. When NA cells were killed by SNP, high levels of NO2- (stable end product of NO) were detected in the culture medium. The cell death induced by SNP was mediated by apoptosis, as demonstrated by the presence of nuclear condensation and blebbing of the nuclear membrane, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation quantified by a specific ELISA. Northern blot analysis revealed that c-myc mRNA expression of NA cells was rapidly reduced by treatment with SNP. RT-PCR analysis showed that c-myb mRNA was expressed in untreated NA cells, and c-myb mRNA level of NA cells was dose-dependently reduced by treatment with SNP. These results indicate that SNP exerts its cytotoxic effect on NA cells through spontaneous release of NO. Cytotoxicity induced by SNP is at least partially mediated via the process known as apoptosis. Our results also suggest that down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb proto-oncogenes might be involved in SNP-induced cytotoxicit.
ide (NO) functions as an intercellular messenger molecule in such varied contexts as neurotransmission, immune regulation, and the control of vascular tone. We report that NO, delivered as purified gas or released from the pharmacologic NO donors sodium nitroprusside or 6-morpholino-sydnonimine, caused monocytic differentiation of cells of the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 and altered gene expression. The treated cells stopped proliferating, became spread and vacuolated, had increased expression of nonspecific esterase and the monocyte marker CD14, and displayed increased capacity to produce hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, these treated cells had increased steady-state expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), but decreased expression of mRNA for the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb. The increase in TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA levels was due (at least in part) to a new transcription of these specific mRNAs. NO elaborated in the bone marrow microenvironment may have a role in normal and malignant hematopoietic cell growth and differentiatio.
ocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophage-like cells by treatment with cardiotonic steroid bufalin, which was previously shown to interact with the Na+, K+-ATPase with similar kinetics to ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. This induction of differentiation was characterized by loss of proliferation, cell adherence, increased ability to reduce Nitro Blue tetrazolium (NBT), and increased expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). During this process, bufalin downregulated c-myb and c-myc expressions and induced c-fos and Egr-1 transcripts. Ouabain also caused similar changes in proto- oncogene expression and induced phenotypic markers of differentiated cells at concentrations comparable to bufalin. The 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate resistant THP-1 cell variant, which was unresponsive to this agent as to growth inhibition and proto-oncogene expression, responded to bufalin. The finding that protein kinase inhibitor H7 failed to bufalin-mediated c-fos induction further supports the theory that the signal transduction machinery caused by bufalin is separable from the phorbol ester. The cytotoxic effect of high doses of bufalin apparently disappeared in the medium where Na+ was replaced with choline ions. Furthermore, bufalin failed to induce c-fos expression and to downregulate c-myb transcripts in the low-Na+ medium. These findings indicate that an increased intracellular Na+ concentration resulting from the Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibition possibly triggers the change in proto-oncogene expression evoked by bufali.
-based drug design methods were used to search for novel inhibitors of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase and Mycobacterium tuberculosis thymidylate kinase. The method involved the use of crystal structure complexes to guide database searching for potential inhibitors. A number of weak inhibitors of HSV-2 were identified, one of which was found to inhibit HSV-1 TK and HSV-1 TK-deficient viral strains. Each compound tested against M. tuberculosis thymidylate kinase was found to have some activity. The best of these compounds was only 4.6-fold less potent than 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (AZTMP). This study demonstrates the utility of structure-based drug design methods in the search for novel enzyme inhibitor.
and rapid capillary electrophoretic method was developed for the simultaneous determination of thymidylate (TMP) and thymidine 5'-diphosphate (TDP) in enzyme assays without using radioactive-labeled substrates. Prior to electrophoretic separation, addition of acetonitrile and sodium chloride to the assay solution and brief centrifugation are recommended for the purpose of sample cleanup and sample stacking. The separation of micromolar TMP and TDP from millimolar adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was performed at 25 degrees C using sodium tetraborate as the background electrolyte. Under the optimal condition, a good separation with high efficiency was achieved in 6 min. Several parameters affecting the separation were studied, including the pH of electrolyte, the applied voltage, and acetonitrile-salt sample stacking. The fronting of the ATP peak resulting from the interference of magnesium ion in the enzyme assay buffer was suppressed by the addition of sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate to the sample solution. Using deoxyadenylate as an internal standard, the linear range of the method was 5-200 microM, and the concentration limits of detection of TMP and TDP were 2.6 and 3.8 microM, respectively. Application of the proposed method for simultaneous determination of TMP and TDP in enzyme assays was demonstrated by the activity assays of thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase from white spot syndrome virus. This is a sensitive, nonradioactive method for thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase assay.
tic production method for dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose, a key intermediate of various deoxysugars in antibiotics, was developed starting from dTMP, acetyl phosphate, and glucose-1-phosphate. Four enzymes, i.e., TMP kinase, acetate kinase, dTDP-glucose synthase, and dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase' were overexpressed using T7 promoter system in the E. coli BL21 strain, and the dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose was synthesized by using the enzyme extracts in one-pot batch system. When 20 mM dTMP of initial concentration was used, Mg2+ ion, acetyl phosphate, and glucose-1-phosphate concentrations were optimized. About 95% conversion yield of dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose was obtained based on initial dTMP concentration at 20 mM dTMP, 1 mM ATP, 60 mM acetyl phosphate, 80 mM glucose-1-phosphate, and 20 mM MgCl(2). The rate-limiting step in this multiple enzyme reaction system was the dTDP-glucose synthase reaction. Using the reaction scheme, about 1 gram of purified dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose was obtained in an overall yield of 81% after two-step purification, i.e., anion exchange chromatography and gel filtratio.
 structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis TMP kinase at 1.95 A resolution is described as a binary complex with its natural substrate TMP. Its main features involve: (i) a clear magnesium-binding site; (ii) an alpha-helical conformation for the so-called LID region; and (iii) a high density of positive charges in the active site. There is a network of interactions involving highly conserved side-chains of the protein, the magnesium ion, a sulphate ion mimicking the beta phosphate group of ATP and the TMP molecule itself. All these interactions conspire in stabilizing what appears to be the closed form of the enzyme. A complete multialignment of all (32) known sequences of TMP kinases is presented. Subtle differences in the TMP binding site were noted, as compared to the Escherichia coli, yeast and human enzyme structures, which have been reported recently. These differences could be used to design specific inhibitors of this essential enzyme of nucleotide metabolism. Two cases of compensatory mutations were detected in the TMP binding site of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes. In addition, an intriguing high value of the electric field is reported in the vicinity of the phosphate group of TMP and the putative binding site of the gamma phosphate group of AT.
te kinase derived from the blast cells of human chronic myelocytic leukemia was purified 2186-fold to near homogeneity by means of alcohol precipitation, alumina-Cgamma gel fractionation, calcium phosphate gel fraction, ultrafiltration, and affinity column chromatography. The molecular weight was estimated by glycerol gradient centrifugation to be 50,000. This enzyme had an optimal activity at pH 7.1 and required a divalent cation in order to catalyze the reaction. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were found to be the preferential divalent cations. The activation energy was estimated to be 19.1 kcal/mol at pH 7.2. Initial velocity study suggested that the reaction followed a sequential mechanism. Mg2+ ATP had a Km of 0.25 mM and dTMP had a Km of 40 micrometer. The enzyme was unstable even at 4 degrees. In the presence of ATP or dTMP the enzyme maintained its activity. Purine triphosphate nucleosides were found to be better phosphate donors than the pyrimidine triphosphate nucleosides. ATP and dATP had a lower Km and a higher Vmax than GTP and dGTP. dTMP was the only preferred phosphate receptor among all the monophosphate nucleotides tested dTTP and IdUTP competed with both substrates and inhibited the reaction with a Ki of 0.75 mM and 1.1 mM, respectivel.
t of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (IdUMP), various 5-halogenated-5'-azido-2', 5' -dideoxyuridine derivatives, 2'-deoxy-6-azauridine (AzdUrd), and its halogenated analogs on the ultraviolet sensitization of Escherichia coli thymidylate kinase has been investigated. Only those compounds iodinated in position 5 enhance the rate of ultraviolet inactivation of this enzyme. However, 5'-azido nucleosides with iodo, bromo, chloro, or fluoro substituents in position 5 neither protect nor sensitize thymidylate kinase to ultraviolet inactivation. Thymidine 5'-monophosphate partially protects the enzyme against ultraviolet inactivation either in the presence or absence of ultraviolet-sensitizing iodinated analogs. Magnesium ion does not enhance the ultraviolet inactivation of thymidylate kinase by 5-iodinated nucleoside analogs. The kinatic data support an active site-directed enhancement of the enzyme to ultraviolet inactivation by 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate, since the concentration of IdUMP required to attain 50% maximal enhancement is 0.24 mM which is in good agreement with its Ki of 0.18 mM. When either [125I]IdUMP or [2-14C]IdUMP was irradiated with the enzyme, both radioactivities were associated with the enzyme, however only with the 14C analog was the amount bound at half-saturation essentially equal to the amount required to inactivate the enzyme by 50%. These data support the hypothesis that the active entity in the enhancement by IdUMP of thymidylate kinase inactivation during ultraviolet irradiation is the uridylate free radical which is formed photochemically from IdUMP. Photochemical studies of 6-azauracil (AzUra), 2'-deoxy-6-azauridine, and 5-iodo-2'-deoxy-6-azauridine (IAzdUrd) were performed. Photolysis of IAzdUrd in the presence of a hydrogen donor yields AzdUrd which upon further photolysis yields the photohydrate. The photohydrate of AzdUrd when incubated in the dark at pH 5.2 is 90% converted back to AzdUrd, whereas the photohydrate of AzUra is only partially (20%) converted to AzUra. The rate of deiodination of IAzdUrd is 2.1-fold greater than that of IdUMP. Although the Ki of IdUMP and IAzdUrd is similar, the increased photosensitivity of the aza analog accounts for the much greater enhancement of ultraviolet inactivation of thymidylate kinase. The ability of a compound to enhance the ultraviolet inactivation of deoxythymidylate kinase is correlated with the potential of the compound to produce a free radical rather than a photohydrate when the enzyme-substrate analog complex is irradiate.
igated the proteome of the anterior pituitary gland (AP) in a species in which the genome has been sequenced. Subcellular fractions of APs from 2-month-old male mice were prepared for protein denaturation, treatment with trypsin and analyses utilizing micro liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and the database search software SEQUEST. In the nuclear, non-nuclear 100,000 g and cytosolic fractions, we identified 49, 36 and 68 different proteins, respectively. A total of 115 distinct proteins were detected. We identified growth hormone, prolactin, pro-opiomelanocortin, the alpha-subunit for the glycoprotein hormones, and luteinizing hormone-beta. Groups of other identified proteins included hormone-processing, secretion granule-associated, non-hormonal endoplasmic reticulum-associated, calcium-binding, protein kinase C-associated, histones, non-histone chromosomal, other RNA-binding, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, splicing factors, helicases, lamins, ribosomal, microtubule-associated, microfilament-associated, adenosine triphosphate- and guanosine triphosphate-associated, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation, enzymes in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic and urea cycles and the pentose phosphate path, heat-shock, glutathione-associated, peroxidases, ubiquitin-associated, catabolic, protease inhibitors, other, and blood proteins. The 115 proteins reported in this study and the 145 proteins reported in a previous study on the AP of the adult male Golden Syrian hamster are compared and form a foundation for defining the proteome in normal adult male A.
-suppressor gene cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (P27) is downregulated in gastric cancer cells mainly through proteolytic degradation mediated by the SKP-Cullin1-F-Box (SCF) complex. But the correlation between its downregulation and gastric cancer prognosis still remains indefinite. MLN4924, an anti-tumor agent, which suppresses the SCF complex by inhibiting Cullin1 neddylation, emerges as a promising tool to elucidate its functions in gastric cancer cells. In this study, MLN4924 induced significant growth inhibition of gastric cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, along with the simultaneous accumulation of P27 and cell cycle abnormalities such as G2/M arrest. Importantly, we found that P27 silencing in MLN4924-treated cells resulted in an enhancement of growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism analysis revealed the antagonism effects of antioxidants to this excess apoptosis, suggesting reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction especially in the mitochondria was the principal cause of the augmentation. Moreover, the robust ROS attacked the mitochondria to initiate collapse of the mitochondrial membrane permeability and the exportation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), IAP-binding mitochondrial protein (SMAC/DIABLO) and cytochrome c. Finally, we also found that P27 knockdown affected the expression profile of several critical BH3 family members to amplify the mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. In summary, our findings unveiled a protective role of P27 by maintaining mitochondrial membrane permeability in MLN4924-treated gastric cancer cells, and therefore highlighted the potential combination of MLN4924 with P27 inhibition to improve its therapeutic efficac.
levels of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are elevated in multiple human cancers and their activities often play a part in promoting cancer cell survival by blocking apoptotic pathways, controlling signal transduction pathways and contributing to resistance. These proteins function through interactions of their BIR (baculoviral IAP repeat) protein domains with pathway components and these interactions are endogenously antagonized by Smac/Diablo (second mitochondrial activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low isoelectric point). This report describes development of synthetic smac mimetics (SM) and compares their binding, antiproliferative and anti-tumor activities. All dimeric antagonists inhibit in vitro smac tetrapeptide binding to recombinant IAP proteins, rescue IAP-bound caspase-3 activity and show anti-proliferative activity against human A875 melanoma cells. One heterodimeric SM, SM3, binds tightly to IAP proteins in vitro and slowly dissociates (greater than two hours) from these protein complexes compared to the other antagonists. In addition, in vitro SM anti-proliferation potency is influenced by ABCB1 transporter (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B; MDR1, P-gp) activities and one antagonist, SM5, does not appear to be an ABCB1 efflux pump substrate. All dimeric smac mimetics inhibit the growth of human melanoma A875 tumors implanted in athymic mice at well-tolerated doses. One antagonist, SM4, shows broad spectrum in vivo anti-tumor activity and modulates known pharmacodynamic markers of IAP antagonism. These data taken together demonstrate the range of diverse dimeric IAP antagonist activities and supports their potential as anticancer agent.
ess-induced apoptosis is one of the leading problems in seeding cells of tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs). We aim to determine the human bone mesenchymal stem cell (hBMSC) apoptosis under shear stress and its possible mechanis.
re subjected to 3-, 10-, and 30-dyn/cm(2) shear stress in vitro. Cell multiplication and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis-related genes were screened by a microarray and evidenced by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). hBMSCs were treated with the human recombinant cell inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and its inhibitor, direct IAP-binding protein with low pl (DIABLO), and then cell apoptosis was analyze.
to shear stress (3dyn/cm(2) for &gt;6h) activated apoptosis progress of hBMSCs. However, the same degree of shear stress (3dyn/cm(2) for 6h) did not induce apoptosis. Microarray screening and RT-PCR revealed that Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (BOK) and apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), key molecules of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, were markedly upregulated under 3-dyn/cm(2) shear stress. Then, we observed that cIAP1, a Caspase 9 inhibitor, was elevated under 3dyn/cm(2) at short-time exposure (2 or 6h), and it was reduced at long-time exposure (24h). When treated with human recombinant cIAP1, Caspase 3 activity and LDH release of hBMSCs were decreased, and vice versa when treated with DIABL.
enuates hBMSC apoptosis when cells were exposed to shear stress through the regulation of the BOK-APAF1-Caspase 9-Caspase 3 pathway. It may present a pharmacological target to enhance hBMSC biological function in the application of TEBV.
nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease. Emerging evidences indicate that many mechanistic pathways including apoptosis play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study is to show the effects of grape seed extract (GSE) on oxidative stress and apoptosis in the kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat.
 included control group, diabetic group without treatment and diabetic group treated with GSE (n=7) group. GSE was given orally (100 mg/kg/day) for six weeks. Following parameters were evaluated; oxidative stress index, caspase 1, IL1-alpha, caspase 2, IL1-beta, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), DNA fragmentation factor, alpha subunit and beta bubunit (DFFA, DFFB), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), caspase 6, Bcl2-like 1 (BCL-XL), caspase 8, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1 b (TNFRSF1B) and IAP-binding mitochondrial protein (DIABLO.
 stress index levels were significantly increased in the kidney of diabetic group without treatment compared to control group, and decreased in diabetic+GSE group compared to diabetic group without treatment. In the kidney of diabetic group without treatment, caspase 1, IL-1 alpha, BAD, DFFA, DFFB and caspase-6 gene expressions were significantly higher compared to control group. In diabetic+GSE group caspase 1, caspase 2, XIAP, DFFA, BID, BCL-XL and TNFRSF1B genes were significantly decreased compared to control grou.
d reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis gene expression suggesting the protective effect on diabetic nephropath.
 a mitochondrial protein that, during apoptosis, is translocated to the cytoplasm, where it negatively regulates members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family via the IAP-binding motif (IBM) contained within its amino-terminus. Here, we describe a new alternative splice variant from Smac gene, which we have named Smac-ε. Smac-ε lacks both an IBM and a mitochondrial-targeting signal (MTS) element. Smac-ε mRNA exhibits a tissue-specific expression pattern in healthy human tissues as well as in several cancer cell lines. The steady-state levels of endogenous Smac-ε protein is regulated by the proteasomal pathway. When ectopically expressed, this isoform presents a cytosolic localization and is unable to associate with or to regulate the expression of X-linked Inhibitor of apoptosis protein, the best-studied member of IAP family. Nevertheless, over-expression of Smac-ε increases mammosphere formation. Whole genome expression analyses from these mammospheres show activation of several pro-survival and growth pathways, including Estrogen-Receptor signaling. In conclusion, our results support the functionality of this new Smac isofor.
ria play a key role in cell death and its regulation. The permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane which is mainly controlled by proteins of the BCL-2 family, is a key event that can be directly induced by p53 and results in the release of pro-apoptotic factors to the cytosol, such as cytochrome c, second mitochondria derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) binding protein with low pI (SMAC/Diablo), Omi serine protease (Omi/HtrA2), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), or endonuclease G (Endo-G). Hence, the determination of subcellular localization of these proteins is extremely important to predict cell fate and elucidate the specific mechanism of apoptosis. Here we describe the procedures that can be used to study the subcellular location of different pro-apoptotic proteins to be used in basic cell biology and toxicology studie.
ne (Clo), fludarabine (Flu), and busulfan (Bu) are used in pretransplantation conditioning therapy for patients with myeloid leukemia. To further improve their efficacy in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we investigated their synergism with sorafenib (Sor). Exposure of FLT3-ITD-positive MV-4-11 and MOLM 13 cells to Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity; no such synergism was observed in the FLT3-wild type THP-1 and KBM3/Bu250(6) cell lines. The drug synergism in MV-4-11 cells could be attributed to activation of DNA damage response, histone 3 modifications, inhibition of prosurvival kinases, and activation of apoptosis. Further, the phosphorylation of kinases, including FLT3, MAPK kinase (MEK), and AKT, was inhibited. The FLT3-ITD substrate STAT5 and its target gene PIM 2 product decreased when cells were exposed to Sor alone, Bu+Clo+Flu, and Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor. The level of the proapoptotic protein p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) increased, whereas the level of prosurvival protein MCL-1 decreased when cells were exposed to Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor. The interactions of PUMA with MCL-1 and/or BCL-2 were enhanced when cells were exposed to Bu+Clo+Flu or Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor. The changes in the level of these proteins, which are involved in mitochondrial control of apoptosis, correlate with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Bu+Clo+Flu+Sor decreased mitochondrial membrane potential by 60% and caused leakage of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)/direct IAP Binding protein with low pI (DIABLO), and AIF from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, caspase activation, and cell death, suggesting the activation of apoptosis. Analogous, synergistic cytotoxicity in response to Bu, Clo, Flu, and Sor was observed in mononuclear cells isolated from FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. Although our previous studies were aimed at standardizing the conditioning regimen, the new findings suggest that patients with abnormal expression of FLT3 might further benefit from individualizing treatment through the addition of Sor to Bu+Clo+Flu, thereby providing personalized pretransplantation therap.
depressive disorder (MDD), lowered neural activity and significant reductions of markers of cell resiliency to degeneration occur in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It is still unclear whether changes in other relevant markers of cell vulnerability to degeneration and markers of cell proliferation are associated with MD.
 caspase 8 (C8), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), direct IAP binding protein with low pI (DIABLO), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and density of cells immunoreactive (-IR) for proliferation marker Ki-67 were measured in postmortem samples of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of subjects with MDD, and psychiatrically-normal comparison subject.
 significant increase in C8, a higher ratio of DIABLO to XIAP, lower packing density of Ki-67-IR cells, and an unexpected age-dependent increase in PCNA in subjects with MDD vs. controls. PCNA levels were significantly higher in MDD subjects unresponsive to antidepressants or untreated with antidepressants. The DIABLO/XIAP ratio was higher in MDD subjects without antidepressants than in comparison subject.
ve nature of responsiveness assessments; definition of resistance to antidepressant treatment is still controversial; and unclear role of PCN.
f cell vulnerability to degeneration are increased and density of Ki67-positive cells is low MDD, but accompanied by normal XIAP levels. The results suggest increased vulnerability to cell pathology in depression that is insufficient to cause morphologically conspicuous cell death. Persistent but low-grade vulnerability to cell degeneration coexisting with reduced proliferation readiness may explain age-dependent reductions in neuronal densities in the OFC of depressed subject.
 of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are widely considered as promising cancer drug targets, especially for drug-resistant tumors. Mimicking the IAP-binding motif of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) is a rational strategy to design potential IAP inhibitors. In this report, we used the bioactive conformation of AVPI tetrapeptide in the N terminus of SMAC as a template and performed a shape-based virtual screening against a drug-like compound library to identify novel IAP inhibitors. Top hits were subsequently docked to available IAP crystal structures as a secondary screening followed by validation using in vitro biologic assays. Four novel hit compounds were identified to potently inhibit cell growth in two human melanoma (A375 and M14) and two human prostate (PC-3 and DU145) cancer cell lines. The best compound, UC-112 [5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)quinolin-8-ol], has IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 3.4 µM. UC-112 also potently inhibits the growth of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressed multidrug-resistant cancer cells, strongly activates caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activities, and selectively downregulates survivin level at a concentration as low as 1 µM. Coincubation of UC-112 with a known proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG-132) rescued survivin inhibition, consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action for UC-112. As a single agent, UC-112 strongly inhibits tumor growth and reduces both X chromosome-linked IAP and survivin levels in an A375 human melanoma xenograft model in vivo. Overall, our study identified novel scaffolds, especially UC-112, as new platforms on which potent and selective IAP antagonists can be develope.
nal long isoform of Fas Apoptotic Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM-L) protects from death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis, yet its mechanism of protection remains unknown. Here, we show that FAIM-L protects rat neuronal Type II cells from Fas-induced apoptosis. XIAP has previously emerged as a molecular discriminator that is upregulated in Type II and downregulated in Type I apoptotic signaling. We demonstrate that FAIM-L requires sustained endogenous levels of XIAP to protect Type II cells as well as murine cortical neurons from Fas-induced apoptosis. FAIM-L interacts with the BIR2 domain of XIAP through an IAP-binding motif, the mutation of which impairs the antiapoptotic function of FAIM-L. Finally, we report that FAIM-L inhibits XIAP auto-ubiquitinylation and maintains its stability, thus conferring protection from apoptosis. Our results bring new understanding of the regulation of endogenous XIAP by a DR antagonist, pointing out at FAIM-L as a promising therapeutic tool for protection from apoptosis in pathological situations where XIAP levels are decrease.
al skin wound healing, hypertrophic scars (HS) are characterized by excessive fibroblast hypercellularity and an overproduction of collagen, leading to atypical extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Although the exact mechanisms of HS remain unclear, decreased HS fibroblast (HSFB) apoptosis and increased proliferation are evident in the development of HS. In this study, the contribution of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding protein with a low isoelectric point (pI) (Smac/DIABLO), an apoptosis-promoting protein released from the mitochondria, was investigated in human normal skin and HSFB cultures. The expression of Smac/DIABLO is usually decreased in many malignant tumors compared with normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of skin tissues and the western blot analyses of fibroblasts revealed that the expression of Smac/DIABLO was lower in HS tissues compared with normal skin tissues. Of note, adenovirus-mediated Smac/DIABLO overexpression in the cultured HSFBs significantly reduced cell proliferation, as detected by the cell counting kit-8, and increased caspase-3 and -9 activity, as detected by spectrofluorimetry. In addition, it increased apoptosis, as detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Furthermore, we found that the silencing of Smac with siRNA in the HSFBs induced a noticeable decrease in caspase-3 and -9 activity, leading to a significant reduction in apoptosis. In addition, the mRNA expression of type I and III pro-collagen detected in the HSFBs was significantly increased following the silencing of Smac with siRNA and was inhibited following Smac/DIABLO overexpression, as shown by real-time RT-PCR. In conclusion, Smac/DIABLO decreases the proliferation and increases the apoptosis of HSFBs. To our knowledge, the data from our study suggest for the first time that Smac/DIABLO is a novel therapeutic target for H.
ria are arbiters in the fragile balance between cell life and death. These organelles present an intricate membrane system, with a peculiar lipid composition and displaying transverse as well as lateral asymmetry. Some lipids are synthesized inside mitochondria, while others have to be imported or acquired in the form of precursors. Here, we review different processes, including external interventions (e.g., diet) and a range of biological events (apoptosis, disease and aging), which may result in alterations of mitochondrial membrane lipid content. Cardiolipin, the mitochondria lipid trademark, whose biosynthetic pathway is highly regulated, will deserve special attention in this review. The modulation of mitochondrial membrane lipid composition, especially by diet, as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of some pathologies will be also addresse.
ion can be either beneficial or detrimental to the liver, depending on multiple factors. Mild (i.e., limited in intensity and destined to resolve) inflammatory responses have indeed been shown to exert consistent hepatoprotective effects, contributing to tissue repair and promoting the re-establishment of homeostasis. Conversely, excessive (i.e., disproportionate in intensity and permanent) inflammation may induce a massive loss of hepatocytes and hence exacerbate the severity of various hepatic conditions, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, systemic metabolic alterations (e.g., obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disorders), alcoholic hepatitis, intoxication by xenobiotics and infection, de facto being associated with irreversible liver damage, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis. Both liver-resident cells (e.g., Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells) and cells that are recruited in response to injury (e.g., monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells) emit pro-inflammatory signals including - but not limited to - cytokines, chemokines, lipid messengers, and reactive oxygen species that contribute to the apoptotic or necrotic demise of hepatocytes. In turn, dying hepatocytes release damage-associated molecular patterns that-upon binding to evolutionary conserved pattern recognition receptors-activate cells of the innate immune system to further stimulate inflammatory responses, hence establishing a highly hepatotoxic feedforward cycle of inflammation and cell death. In this review, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms that account for the most deleterious effect of hepatic inflammation at the cellular level, that is, the initiation of a massive cell death response among hepatocyte.
n-associated protein (PSAP) has been identified as a mitochondrial proapoptotic protein. However, the mechanism by which PSAP induces apoptosis remains unknown. To this end, we have established an inducible expression system. Using this system, we have examined the roles of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, cytochrome c, Smac (Smac/Diablo, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low PI), and Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor) in PSAP-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of Apaf-1 abolished PSAP-induced caspase activation and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, indicating that the apoptosome formation triggered by cytochrome c is crucial for PSAP-induced apoptosis. Our data also demonstrate that knockdown of Smac abolished PSAP-induced caspase activation and PARP cleavage, indicating that, in addition to Apaf-1 or apoptosome formation, Smac is also essential for PSAP-induced apoptosis. However, interestingly, our data demonstrate that overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL did not protect cells from PSAP-induced apoptosis, and that knockdown of Bid, Bax, and Bak had no effect on PSAP-induced cytochrome c and Smac release, indicating that PSAP-induced apoptosis is not regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. These results strongly suggest that PSAP evokes mitochondrial apoptotic cascades via a novel mechanism that is not regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins, but that both the formation of cytochrome c-Apaf-1 apoptosome and the presence of Smac are absolutely required for PSAP-induced apoptosi.
 called CD95 or APO-1), a member of a subgroup of the tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily that contain an intracellular death domain, can initiate apoptosis signalling and has a critical role in the regulation of the immune system. Fas-induced apoptosis requires recruitment and activation of the initiator caspase, caspase-8 (in humans also caspase-10), within the death-inducing signalling complex. In so-called type 1 cells, proteolytic activation of effector caspases (-3 and -7) by caspase-8 suffices for efficient apoptosis induction. In so-called type 2 cells, however, killing requires amplification of the caspase cascade. This can be achieved through caspase-8-mediated proteolytic activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain (BH)3-only protein BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), which then causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation. This in turn leads to mitochondrial release of apoptogenic proteins, such as cytochrome c and, pertinent for Fas death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis, Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low Pi), an antagonist of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), which imposes a brake on effector caspases. In this review, written in honour of Juerg Tschopp who contributed so much to research on cell death and immunology, we discuss the functions of Bid and XIAP in the control of Fas DR-induced apoptosis signalling, and we speculate on how this knowledge could be exploited to develop novel regimes for treatment of cance.
, via caspase cascade, is involved in tumorigenesis and progression, and thus, altered apoptosis-related protein expressions have clinical and prognostic significance. Moreover, the apoptosis pathway is highlighted due to the recent introduction of apoptosis-targeted therapy for several genes such as the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). XIAP is the most potent direct inhibitor of caspase, and XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) and secondary mitochondrial activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low PI (Smac/DIABLO) are negative regulators of XIAP. In this study, we evaluated the expression of these proteins and investigated their clinical and prognostic significance in gastric carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis by using the tissue array method was performed for XIAP, survivin, Bcl-2, XAF1, Smac/DIABLO, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins in 1,162 surgically resected gastric carcinoma cases. XIAP expression was related to the advanced stage. The expression of XIAP showed negative relationship with XAF1 and Smac/DIABLO expressions. In addition, XIAP expression was associated with a poor prognosis and was also proved to be an independent prognostic factor. Cleaved caspase-3 expression was related to the early stage. In addition, cleaved caspase-3 expression was associated with a favorable prognosis and was also proved to be an independent prognostic factor. The expression of XIAP showed an inverse relationship with cleaved caspase-3. In addition, the expression of XAF1 and Smac/DIABLO had a positive relationship with cleaved caspase-3. These findings are consistent with their known functions, and they may help to identify individuals best suited for apoptosis-targeted therapy as a baseline data in gastric carcinom.
 of apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding proteins such as Grim, Reaper and HID have been shown to exert a critical role in regulating caspase activity in species such as D. Melanogaster. However, a comparable role for the mammalian homologue of second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO) has yet to be clearly established in vivo. Despite tremendous interest in recent years in the use of so-called Smac mimetics to enhance chemotherapeutic potency, our understanding of the true physiologic nature of Smac/DIABLO in regulating programmed cell death (PCD) remains elusive. In order to critically evaluate the role of Smac/DIABLO in regulating mammalian PCD, deficiency of caspase-3 was used as a sensitizing mutation in order to reduce aggregate levels of executioner caspase activity. We observe that combinatorial deletion of Diablo and Casp3, but neither alone, results in perinatal lethality in mice. Consistent with this, examination of both intrinsic and extrinsic forms of PCD in lines of murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrate that loss of Smac/DIABLO alters both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent intrinsic PCD. Comparative small interfering RNA inhibition studies of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP)-1, cIAP-2, caspase-6 and -7 in both wild-type and Casp3/Diablo DKO mouse embryonic fibroblast lineages, supports a model in which Smac/DIABLO acts to enhance the early phase executioner caspase activity through the modulation of inhibitory interactions between specific IAP family members and executioner caspases-3 and -.
 the apoptotic permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, the inter-membrane space protein second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) is released into the cytosol. Smac efficiently promotes apoptosis by antagonizing x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an inhibitor of caspases-9, -3, and -7, via a short NH(2)-terminal inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) binding motif (AVPI). Native Smac dimerizes to form a highly stable and inflexible elongated arch, however, a functional role for this outstretched structure so far remained unknown. Using time-lapse single-cell imaging of DLD-1 and HCT-116 colon cancer cells, we here demonstrate that upon mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization physiological expression levels of XIAP are sufficient to selectively prolong the release of dimeric but not monomeric Smac. Elevating the expression of XIAP further extended the release duration of dimeric Smac and resulted in the mitochondrial retention of a significant proportion of the Smac pool. In contrast, monomeric Smac was always fully released and the release kinetics were not affected by altered XIAP expression. Our findings therefore indicate that the dimerization of Smac is critical for the XIAP-mediated retention of Smac at or inside the mitochondria. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 11th European Symposium on Calciu.
residues at the amino-terminus of mature Smac/DIABLO are an IAP binding motif (IBM). Upon exit from mitochondria, mature Smac interacts with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), abrogating caspase inhibition. We used the ubiquitin fusion model to express mature Smac in the cytosol. Transiently expressed mature Smac56-239 (called Smac56) and Smac60-239 (called Smac60), which lacks the IBM, interacted with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). However, stable expression produced wild type Smac56 that failed to homodimerize, interact with XIAP, and potentiate caspase activation. Cytosolic Smac60 retained these functions. Cytosolic Smac56 apparently becomes posttranslationally modified at the dimer interface region, which obliterated the epitope for a monoclonal antibody. Cytosolic Smacδ, which has the IBM but lacks amino acids 62-105, homodimerized and weakly interacted with XIAP, but failed to potentiate apoptosis. These findings suggest that the IBM of Smac is a recognition point for a posttranslational modification(s) that blocks homodimerization and IAP interaction, and that amino acids 62-105 are required for the proapoptotic function of Sma.
 acid is a natural product with a range of biological effects, for example potent antitumor activity. This anticancer property is linked to its ability to induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cells by triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In contrast to the cytotoxicity of betulinic acid against a variety of cancer types, normal cells and tissue are relatively resistant to betulinic acid, pointing to a therapeutic window. Compounds that exert a direct action on mitochondria present promising experimental cancer therapeutics, since they may trigger cell death under circumstances in which standard chemotherapeutics fail. Thus, mitochondrion-targeted agents such as betulinic acid hold great promise as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of human cancer.
n C is a pure compound isolated from Paris formosana Hayata (Liliaceae). The antitumor efficacy of formosanin C has been observed in cultured cells and animal systems. However, the molecular mechanisms of formosanin C remain unknown. The results of the present study indicate that formosanin C induced apoptosis of HT-29 cells characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine, accumulation of cells at the sub-G(1) phase, fragmentation of DNA, and change of nuclear morphology in a time- and dose-related manner. The apoptotic signaling cascades may proceed via proteolytic activation of caspase-2, change of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), release of cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO), activation of caspase-9 and -3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Increase in apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease G expressions in nuclei, and increase in Bax and Bak expressions and decrease in Bcl-X(L) expression on mitochondria were also observed in formosanin C-treated HT-29 cells. Attenuation of formosanin C-induced change of Deltapsi(m) by caspase-2 inhibitor (Z-VDVAC) implies that caspase-2 acts upstream of the mitochondria. Blockage of formosanin C-induced apoptotic process by using either permeability transition pore inhibitor (cyclosporine A) or caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD) demonstrates the necessity of mitochondria and caspase-9 in formosanin C-induced apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Taken together, the apoptotic mechanism of formosanin C in human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells involves activation of caspase-2 and the dysfunction of mitochondri.
tion of apoptosis is a key factor in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is the most potent member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, which directly inhibits apoptosis by binding to caspases. Antagonists of XIAP have recently been identified: second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low PI (Smac/DIABLO) and XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1). However, little research has been conducted on the association between gastric cancer survival and the mechanism of apoptosis involving XIAP and its antagonists, Smac/DIABLO and XAF.
c/DIABLO, and XAF1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 187 gastric adenocarcinomas. Correlations between XIAP, Smac/DIABLO or XAF1 expression and clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Disease-specific survival after surgery was examine.
mples, XIAP was overexpressed in 140, Smac was overexpressed in 117, and XAF1 was overexpressed in 106. Individually, XIAP, Smac, and XAF1 were not significantly associated with disease-specific survival. However, patients showing high expression of XIAP and low expression of XAF1 had significantly poorer survival when compared with other groups (P = 0.024.
ssion balance of XIAP and XAF1 is an independent prognostic factor in gastric adenocarcinom.
 forebrain or global ischemia induces delayed neuronal death in vulnerable CA1 pyramidal cells with many features of apoptosis. A brief period of ischemia, i.e., ischemic preconditioning, affords robust protection of CA1 neurons against a subsequent more prolonged ischemic challenge. Here we show that preconditioning acts via PI3K/Akt signaling to block the ischemia-induced cascade involving mitochondrial translocation of Bad, assembly of Bad with Bcl-x(L), cleavage of Bcl-x(L) to form its prodeath fragment, DeltaN-Bcl-x(L), activation of large-conductance channels in the mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI), caspase activation, and neuronal death. These findings show how preconditioning acts to prevent the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria and to preserve the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane. The specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 administered in vivo 1 h before or immediately after ischemia or up to 120 h later significantly reverses preconditioning-induced protection, indicating a requirement for sustained PI3K signaling in ischemic tolerance. These findings implicate PI3K/Akt signaling in maintenance of the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membran.
rial proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 play important roles in the cell death pathways of mammalian cells. In Drosophila, the role of mitochondria in cell death is less clear. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Drosophila ortholog of human Omi/HtrA2. We show that Drosophila Omi/HtrA2 is imported into the mitochondria where it undergoes proteolytic maturation to yield two isoforms, dOmi-L and dOmi-S. dOmi-L contains a canonical N-terminal IAP-binding motif (AVVS), whereas dOmi-S contains a distinct N-terminal motif (SKMT). DIAP1 was able to bind to both isoforms via its BIR1 and BIR2 domains. This resulted in cleavage of the linker region of DIAP1 between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains and further degradation of the BIR1 domain by the proteolytic activity of dOmi. The binding of DIAP1 to dOmi also resulted in DIAP1-mediated polyubiquitination of dOmi, suggesting that DIAP1 could target dOmi for proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, expression of DIAP1 in Drosophila eye discs protected them from dOmi-induced eye ablation, indicating that DIAP1 plays an important role in protecting cells from the potentially lethal effects of dOmi. The ability of IAPs to bind to and ubiquitinate mitochondrial proteins such as dOmi may be a key conserved function to counterbalance the lethal effects of these proteins if accidentally released into the cytoso.
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury triggers multiple and distinct but overlapping cell signaling pathways, which may lead to cell survival or cell damage. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that besides necrosis, apoptosis do contributes significantly to the cell death subsequent to I/R injury. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways play a vital role, and upon initiation, these pathways recruit downstream apoptotic molecules to execute cell death. Caspases and Bcl-2 family members appear to be crucial in regulating multiple apoptotic cell death pathways initiated during I/R. Similarly, inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins (IAPs), mitogen-activated protein kinases, and newly identified apoptogenic molecules, like second mitochondrial-activated factor/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (Smac/Diablo), omi/high-temperature requirement serine protease A2 (Omi/HtrA2), X-linked mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis protein-associated factor 1, and apoptosis-inducing factor, have emerged as potent regulators of cellular apoptotic/antiapoptotic machinery. All instances of cell survival/death mechanisms triggered during I/R are multifaceted and interlinked, which ultimately decide the fate of brain cells. Moreover, apoptotic cross-talk between major subcellular organelles suggests that therapeutic strategies should be optimally directed at multiple targets/mechanisms for better therapeutic outcome. Based on the current knowledge, this review briefly focuses I/R injury-induced multiple mechanisms of apoptosis, involving key apoptotic regulators and their emerging roles in orchestrating cell death programme. In addition, we have also highlighted the role of autophagy in modulating cell survival/death during cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to provide an encouraging outlook on emerging therapeutic approaches for cerebral ischemi.
radiation is main factor of photocarcinogenesis, photoageing, and phototoxicity; thus, protection from UV radiation is major concern. Sunscreens containing UV filters are suggested as sun safe practices, but safety of UV filters remains in controversies. Benzophenone-1 (BP1) is commonly used in sunscreens as UV blocker. We assessed the photogenotoxicity and apoptotic parameters in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) by western blot, immunocytochemistry, flowcytometry, Comet assay and TEM imaging. Our results exposed that BP1 photosensitized and generated intracellular ROS (2.02 folds) under sunlight/UVR. Decrease in cell viability was recorded as 80.06%, 60.98% and 56.24% under sunlight, UVA and UVB, respectively. Genotoxic potential of BP1 was confirmed through photomicronuclei and CPDs formation. BP1 enhanced lipid peroxidation and leakage of LDH enzyme (61.7%). Apoptotic cells were detected by AnnexinV/PI staining and sub G1 population of cell cycle. BP1 induced up regulation of apoptotic proteins Bax/Bcl2 ratio, Apaf-1, cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO and cleaved caspase 3 was noticed. Down regulation of pro caspase 3 was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (inhibitor of caspase). Thus, study established the involvement of BP1 in photogenotoxicity and apoptosis via release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. These findings suggest sunscreen user to avoid BP1 in cosmetics preparation for its topical applicatio.
he first ever attempt to combine anti-cancer therapeutic effects of emerging anticancer biodrug bovine lactoferrin (bLf), and multimodal imaging efficacy of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) together, as a saturated Fe3O4-bLf. For cancer stem cell specific uptake of nanocapsules/nanocarriers (NCs), Fe3O4-bLf was encapsulated in alginate enclosed chitosan coated calcium phosphate (AEC-CP) NCs targeted (Tar) with locked nucleic acid (LNA) modified aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and nucleolin markers. The nanoformulation was fed orally to mice injected with triple positive (EpCAM, CD133, CD44) sorted colon cancer stem cells in the xenograft cancer stem cell mice model. The complete regression of tumor was observed in 70% of mice fed on non-targeted (NT) NCs, with 30% mice showing tumor recurrence after 30 days, while only 10% mice fed with Tar NCs showed tumor recurrence indicating a significantly higher survival rate. From tumor tissue analyses of 35 apoptotic markers, 55 angiogenesis markers, 40 cytokines, 15 stem cell markers and gene expression studies of important signaling molecules, it was revealed that the anti-cancer mechanism of Fe3O4-bLf was intervened through TRAIL, Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) mediated phosphorylation of p53, to induce activation of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)/DIABLO (inhibiting survivin) and mitochondrial depolarization leading to release of cytochrome C. Induction of apoptosis was observed by inhibition of the Akt pathway and activation of cytokines released from monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (interleukin (IL) 27, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC)). On the other hand, the recurrence of tumor in AEC-CP-Fe3O4-bLf NCs fed mice mainly occurred due to activation of alternative pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and Wnt signaling leading to an increase in expression of survivin, survivin splice variant (survivin 2B) and other anti-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bcl-2 and XIAP. Apart from the promising anti-cancer efficacy and the exceptional tumor targeting ability observed by multimodal imaging using near-infrared (NIR) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomographic (CT) techniques, these NCs also maintained the immunomodulatory benefits of bLf as they were able to increase the RBC, hemoglobin, iron calcium and zinc levels in mic.
y aimed to determine the effects of electroacupuncture stimulation at the Baihui (GV20) and Fengfu (GV16) acupoints, at frequencies of 5Hz (EA-5Hz) and 25Hz (EA-25Hz), 7 days after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and to evaluate the possible signaling mechanisms involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.
 subjected to 30&nbsp;min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by 7 days of reperfusion. EA-5Hz or EA-25Hz was applied immediately after MCAo and then once daily for 7 consecutive day.
ndicated that EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz both markedly attenuated cerebral infarction and neurological deficits. EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz both markedly downregulated cytosolic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), mitochondrial Bax, mitochondrial and cytosolic second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/DIABLO), and cytosolic cleaved caspase-3 expression, and effectively restored cytosolic phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), cytosolic cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), mitochondrial Bcl-xL, and cytosolic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression, in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 days after reperfusion. Both EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz also significantly increased the ratios of mitochondrial Bcl-xL/Bax and Bcl-2/Bax, respectivel.
Hz and EA-25Hz effectively downregulate reactive astrocytosis to provide neuroprotection against cerebral infarction, most likely by activating the p38 MAPK/CREB signaling pathway. The modulating effects of EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz on Bax-mediated apoptosis are possibly due to the activation of p38 MAPK/CREB/Bcl-xL and p38 MAPK/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling pathways, respectively, and eventually contribute to the prevention of Smac/DIABLO translocation and subsequent restoration of XIAP-mediated suppression of caspase-3 in the cortical periinfarct area 7 days after reperfusio.
 apoptosis requires Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which releases death-promoting proteins cytochrome c and Smac to the cytosol, which activate apoptosis and inhibit X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) suppression of executioner caspases, respectively. We recently identified that in response to Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins and mitochondrial depolarization, XIAP can permeabilize and enter mitochondria. Consequently, XIAP E3 ligase activity recruits endolysosomes into mitochondria, resulting in Smac degradation. Here, we explored mitochondrial XIAP action within the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that mitochondrial XIAP entry requires Bax or Bak and is antagonized by pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins. Moreover, intramitochondrial Smac degradation by XIAP occurs independently of Drp1-regulated cytochrome c release. Importantly, mitochondrial XIAP actions are activated cell-intrinsically by typical apoptosis inducers TNF and staurosporine, and XIAP overexpression reduces the lag time between the administration of an apoptotic stimuli and the onset of mitochondrial permeabilization. To elucidate the role of mitochondrial XIAP action during apoptosis, we integrated our findings within a mathematical model of intrinsic apoptosis signaling. Simulations suggest that moderate increases of XIAP, combined with mitochondrial XIAP preconditioning, would reduce MOMP signaling. To test this scenario, we pre-activated XIAP at mitochondria via mitochondrial depolarization or by artificially targeting XIAP to the intermembrane space. Both approaches resulted in suppression of TNF-mediated caspase activation. Taken together, we propose that XIAP enters mitochondria through a novel mode of mitochondrial permeabilization and through Smac degradation can compete with canonical MOMP to act as an anti-apoptotic tuning mechanism, reducing the mitochondrial contribution to the cellular apoptosis capacit.
 Survivin, as an inhibitor of apoptosis and a regulator of cell division, has become a worldwide controversial issue. Piperine as a pungent alkaloid has been identified as the most potent adjuvant at enhancing the efficacy of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based therapies in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro and in vivo, which might be mediated through inhibition of Survivin. In this work, the binding energies, inhibition constants and binding modes of a group of previously synthesized Piperine derivatives at the binding site of Survivin have been studied using molecular docking tools and the best compounds with minimum binding energies are proposed as potential drugs for the inhibition of Survivin. A comprehensive SAR analysis has been done on the results that can be used for designing new Piperine analogs with higher efficacy. Molecular docking computations also show that the studied compounds can bind to BIR domain of Survivin in the same binding site as that of Smac/DIABLO with a suitable binding energy. This binding may result in the segregation of Smac/DIABLO in the cytosol and subsequently free Smac/DIABLO molecules could be available for binding with inhibitors of apoptosis to initiate caspase mediated apoptosi.
usly observed that glioma cells are differentially sensitive to TRAIL-induced toxicity. Based on our observation that TRAIL-resistant glioma cell lines typically exhibited high levels of Akt activation, we hypothesized that inhibition of Akt signaling using the PI3 kinase inhibitor NVP-BKM120 could promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis in gliomas. We assessed this combination in established and primary cultured glioma cells. Combination treatment led to significant cellular death when compared to either drug alone, but had no effect in normal human astrocytes, and demonstrated activation of the caspase cascade. This enhanced apoptosis appears dependent upon the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of Smac/DIABLO, AIF and cytochrome&nbsp;c into the cytosol. The upregulation of Noxa and sequestration of Mcl-1 by Noxa were important factors for cell death. Knockdown of Noxa abrogated apoptosis and suggested dependency on Noxa in combination-induced apoptosis. BKM120 upregulated cell surface expression of death receptor&nbsp;5 (DR5), but did not increase levels of the other major TRAIL receptor, death receptor&nbsp;4 (DR4). This study demonstrates that antagonizing apoptosis-resistance pathways, such as the PI3/Akt pathway, in combination with death receptor activation, may induce cell death in TRAIL-resistant gliom.
n Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1, originally identified as a transcription factor of the human interferon (IFN)-β gene, mediates tumor suppression and may inhibit oncogenesis. We have shown that IRF-1 in human breast cancer cells results in the down-regulation of survivin, tumor cell death, and the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo in xenogeneic mouse models. In this current report, we initiate studies comparing the effect of IRF-1 in human nonmalignant breast cell and breast cancer cell lines. While IRF-1 in breast cancer cells results in growth inhibition and cell death, profound growth inhibition and cell death are not observed in nonmalignant human breast cells. We show that TNF-α or IFN-γ induces IRF-1 in breast cancer cells and results in enhanced cell death. Abrogation of IRF-1 diminishes TNF-α and IFN-γ-induced apoptosis. We test the hypothesis that IRF-1 augments TNF-α-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Potential signaling networks elicited by IRF-1 are investigated by evaluating the NF-κB pathway. TNF-α and/or IFN-γ results in decreased presence of NF-κB p65 in the nucleus of breast cancer cells. While TNF-α and/or IFN-γ can induce IRF-1 in nonmalignant breast cells, a marked change in NF-κB p65 is not observed. Moreover, the ectopic expression of IRF-1 in breast cancer cells results in caspase-3, -7, -8 cleavage, inhibits NF-κB activity, and suppresses the expression of molecules involved in the NF-κB pathway. These data show that IRF-1 in human breast cancer cells elicits multiple signaling networks including intrinsic and extrinsic cell death and down-regulates molecules involved in the NF-κB pathwa.
assified as an inflammatory cytokine, plays a key role in the activation of inflammatory processes involving neutrophil.
althy voluntary blood donors were controlled in the study. The granulocyte suspensions were stimulated with rhIL-17 and fMLP. Expression of Bcl-xl, Smac/DIABLO, and Omi/HtrA2 in neutrophil lysates were assessed by Western blot. The level of cytochrome c and activity of caspase 9 was also assayed in these cell.
ts of existing research highlight the importance of rhIL-17 in reducing the survival of neutrophils via the mitochondria, depending on the Bcl-2 protein family. Our research has indicated that rhIL-17 regulates the mutual relationships between the proteins of that family. The proapoptotic effect observed in neutrophils affected by rhIL-17 is a result of a decreased expression of Bcl-xl. Consequently, the expression of apoptogenic proteins, including cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and Omi/HtrA2, is elevated. Surprisingly, there have been no observations of the cytokine influencing the activity of caspase .
ave shown for the first time that IL-17 has a direct effect on the decrease of Bcl-xl. In conclusion, the results of the research presented in this article confirm the dual action of IL-17, which, on the one hand, leads to an array of proinflammatory mechanisms regarding neutrophils and, on the other hand, reduces the survival of those cells via an immediate influence on the Bcl-2 family of proteins and apoptogenic factor.
s of normal and cancer stem cells are resistant to killing by genotoxins, but the mechanism for this resistance is poorly understood. Here we show that adult stem cells in Drosophila melanogaster germline and midgut are resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) or chemically induced apoptosis and dissect the mechanism for this protection. We find that upon IR the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie/Tie-2 is activated, leading to the upregulation of microRNA bantam that represses FOXO-mediated transcription of pro-apoptotic Smac/DIABLO orthologue, Hid in germline stem cells. Knockdown of the IR-induced putative Tie ligand, Pvf1, a functional homologue of human Angiopoietin, in differentiating daughter cells renders germline stem cells sensitive to IR, suggesting that the dying daughters send a survival signal to protect their stem cells for future repopulation of the tissue. If conserved in cancer stem cells, this mechanism may provide therapeutic options for the eradication of cance.
apy resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still a major unsolved problem highlighting the need to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we identify a novel synergistic induction of cell death by the combination of the Smac mimetic BV6, which antagonizes Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, and the triterpenoid oleanolic acid (OA) in human HCC cells. Importantly, BV6 and OA also cooperate to suppress long-term clonogenic survival as well as tumor growth in a preclinical in vivo model of HCC underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. In contrast, BV6/OA cotreatment does not exert cytotoxic effects against normal primary hepatocytes, pointing to some tumor selectivity. Mechanistic studies show that BV6/OA cotreatment leads to DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 cleavage, while supply of the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) revealed a cell type-dependent requirement of caspases for BV6/OA-induced cell death. The receptor interacting protein (RIP)1 kinase Inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) or genetic knockdown of RIP1 fails to rescue BV6/OA-mediated cell death, indicating that BV6/OA cotreatment does not primarily engage necroptotic cell death. Notably, the addition of several reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers significantly decreases BV6/OA-triggered cell death, indicating that ROS production contributes to BV6/OA-induced cell death. In conclusion, cotreatment of Smac mimetic and OA represents a novel approach for the induction of cell death in HCC and implicates further studie.
hown that cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) impair clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by preventing TNF-mediated killing/death of infected cells. A key question, with profound therapeutic implications, is whether this finding can be translated to the development of drugs that promote elimination of infected cells. Drug inhibitors of cIAPs were developed as cancer therapeutics to promote TNF-mediated tumor killing. These drugs are also known as Smac mimetics, because they mimic the action of the endogenous protein Smac/Diablo that antagonizes cIAP function. Here, we show using an immunocompetent mouse model of chronic HBV infection that birinapant and other Smac mimetics are able to rapidly reduce serum HBV DNA and serum HBV surface antigen, and they promote the elimination of hepatocytes containing HBV core antigen. The efficacy of Smac mimetics in treating HBV infection is dependent on their chemistry, host CD4(+) T cells, and TNF. Birinapant enhances the ability of entecavir, an antiviral nucleoside analog, to reduce viral DNA production in HBV-infected animals. These results indicate that birinapant and other Smac mimetics may have efficacy in treating HBV infection and perhaps, other intracellular infection.
tic shock induces cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in Xenopus oocytes, but the regulators and signaling pathways involved are not well characterized. Here we show that hyperosmotic shock induces rapid calpain activation and high levels of Smac/DIABLO release from the mitochondria before significant amounts of cytochrome c are released to promote caspase-3 activation. Calpain inhibitors or EGTA microinjection delays osmostress-induced apoptosis, and blockage of Smac/DIABLO with antibodies markedly reduces cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Hyperosmotic shock also activates the p38 and JNK signaling pathways very quickly. Simultaneous inhibition of both p38 and JNK pathways reduces osmostress-induced apoptosis, while sustained activation of these kinases accelerates the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. Therefore, at least four different pathways early induced by osmostress converge on the mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. Deciphering the mechanisms of hyperosmotic shock-induced apoptosis gives insight for potential treatments of human diseases that are caused by perturbations in fluid osmolarit.
directly triggers cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release in mitochondria isolated from U937 cells. These effects were not observed in mitochondria pre-exposed for 15 min to 10 µM L-ascorbic acid (AA). In other experiments, intact cells treated for 24-72 h with arsenite were found to die by apoptosis through a mechanism involving mitochondrial permeability transition. Pre-exposure (15 min) to low micromolar concentrations of AA and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), resulting in identical cytosolic levels of the vitamin, had a diverse impact on cell survival, as cytoprotection was only observed after treatment with AA. Also the mitochondrial accumulation of the vitamin was restricted to AA exposure. An additional indication linking cytoprotection to the mitochondrial fraction of the vitamin was obtained in experiments measuring susceptibility to arsenite in parallel with loss of mitochondrial and cytosolic AA at different times after vitamin exposure. Finally, we took advantage of our recent findings that DHA potently inhibits AA transport to demonstrate that DHA abolishes all the protective effects of AA, under the same conditions in which the mitochondrial accumulation of the vitamin is prevented without affecting the overall cellular accumulation of the vitami.
of structurally unique second mitochondria-derived activators of caspase (Smac) that act as antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) directly have been discovered and have been shown to promote chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In this study, we investigate the role of Smac in Taxol-induced apoptosis of lung cancer cell in vitr.
Smac recombinants were transfected into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549. Smac expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The invasive ability of cells was examined. Flow cytometry was used to analyze apoptosis of cells induced by Taxol with Annexin V/PI double staining techniqu.
ession was significantly higher in the PcDNA3.1/Smac recombinant group than in the untransfected group at mRNA and protein level (p &lt; 0.05) and lower invasion through a basal membrane was apparent after transfection (p &lt; 0.05). A small number of cells were promoted to apoptosis in the PcDNA3.1/Smac group. There were significant differences compared to the empty vector group and control group. The apoptosis rate was significantly higher in PcDNA3.1/Smac + Taxol group than in other groups (p &lt; 0.05.
ed Smac can enhance the chemosensitivity of the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 to Taxo.
 B1 (FB1) is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium sp., a common contaminant of maize. FB1 inhibits sphingolipid biosynthesis, alters sphingosine/sphinganine ratios and modifies cell survival and cell death processes at varying propensities at both species- and tissue-specific level. We investigated the effect of FB1 on the apoptotic pathway in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. We measured: (i) the level of cell proliferation and cell death mechanism of HepG2 cells (MTT assay, annexin V and propidium iodide staining, JC-1 assay, γH2AX and cleaved PARP and Hoechst staining); (ii) initiator and executioner caspase activity (luminometric enzyme activity assays); (iii) regulation of mRNA expression of pro- and anti- apoptotic molecules using an apoptosis array (qPCR) and (iv) levels of significantly altered apoptosis-related proteins (Western blotting) following a 24 h incubation. FB1 caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability with an inhibitory concentration for 50% of cell growth at 200 μM. FACS data showed FB1 induced a 2.5-fold increase in annexin V staining, however, caspase activity and mitochondrial depolarization was not significantly influenced. Cleaved PARP and γH2AX were significantly lower in treated cells with minimal DNA condensation and fragmentation observed with the Hoechst stain. BIRC-8/ILP-2 was most significantly up-regulated (8-fold; apoptosis array). ILP2 protein levels were elevated (2.3-fold) with a corresponding decrease in Smac/DIABLO protein levels (1.7-fold). Further analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in BIRC-8/ILP-2 mRNA and protein expression in HepG2 cells. We conclude that FB1 modulates apoptosis in a complex dose-dependent regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecule.
ssion of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl&#8209;1), a member of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family, has been associated with tumor progression and adverse patient outcome. The aims of current study were to evaluate whether Mcl-1 affects the survival or death of gastric cancer cells, and to investigate the prognostic value of its expression in gastric cancer. PcDNA3.1-Mcl-1 expression and Mcl-1 siRNA vectors were used to overexpress and silence Mcl-1 expression in gastric cancer cell lines including SNU638 and TMK1, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of Mcl-1 in gastric cancer tissues. Apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay, and cell proliferation was determined by immunostaining with a Ki-67 antibody. Mcl-1 knockdown induced apoptosis through the upregulation of caspase-3, and -7, and PARP activity, and the release of Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 into the cytoplasm. Additionally, cell cycle arrest occurred due to decrease of cyclin D1, cell division cycle gene 2 (cdc2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6. In contrast, overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Mcl-1 knockdown did not suppress tumor cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells, whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 enhanced tumor cell proliferation. The JAK2 and STAT3 signaling cascades were significantly blocked by Mcl-1 knockdown. The mean Ki-67 labeling index (KI) value of Mcl-1 positive tumors was significantly lower than that of Mcl-1 negative tumors. However, there was no significant difference between Mcl-1 expression and the apoptotic index (AI). Mcl-1 expression was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric mucosa tissues, and was associated with age, tumor size, stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and poor survival. Our study showed that Mcl-1 regulates the cell growth and might be a potential prognostic marker for gastric cance.
m, a widely used bitter agonist, activates bitter taste receptors on many cell types and plays important roles in chemical release, ciliary beating and smooth muscle relaxation through intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent pathways. However, the effects of denatonium on the proliferation of airway epithelial cells and on the integrity of cellular components such as mitochondria have not been studied. In this study, we hypothesize that denatonium might induce airway epithelial cell injury by damaging mitochondri.
eld microscopy, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry analysis were used to examine cellular morphology, proliferation and cell cycle, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to examine mitochondrial integrity. JC-1 dye and western blotting techniques were used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential and protein expression, respectivel.
y epithelial cells, we observed that denatonium significantly effects cellular morphology, decreases cell proliferation and reduces the number of cells in S phase in a dose-dependent manner. TEM analysis demonstrated that denatonium causes large amplitude swelling of mitochondria, which was confirmed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and the subsequent enhancement of the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO after denatonium treatmen.
tudy, we demonstrated for the first time that denatonium damages mitochondria and thus induces apoptosis in airway epithelial cell.
LO in its mature form (20.8 kDa) binds to baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) releasing their inhibitory effects on caspases, thus promoting cell death. Despite its apparent molecular mass (∼100 kDa), Smac-DIABLO was held to be a dimer in solution, simultaneously targeting two distinct BIR domains. We report an extensive biophysical characterization of the protein alone and in complex with the X-linked IAP (XIAP)-BIR2-BIR3 domains. Our data show that Smac-DIABLO adopts a tetrameric assembly in solution and that the tetramer is able to bind two BIR2-BIR3 pairs of domains. Our small-angle x-ray scattering-based tetrameric model of Smac-DIABLO/BIR2-BIR3 highlights some conformational freedom of the complex that may be related to optimization of IAPs bindin.

Further research is needed on the prognostic significance of postoperative macular edema, the role of prophylaxis, the risk among black people, and the effectiveness of depot medication.
y focuses on iodine-131 detected in milk samples from the Dairy Science Unit at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, California following events at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant in March of 2011. The milk samples, collected between March 21 and April 11, 2011, were part of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant Radiological Environmental Monitoring Program. A correlation is made between the integrated activity of iodine-131 found in milk and the integrated activities of iodine-131 of rainwater, vegetation and air samples that were collected from March 19 to April 18, 2011. A comparison is then made to previous studies conducted on dairy cattle that were administered controlled amounts of iodine-131 through ingestion. The comparison shows good agreement to the model which states that generally 1 percent of the activity of iodine-131 ingested by dairy cattle will be detected in harvested milk. Considering the environmental factors and the uncertainties involved, these data and calculated results derived from a real world situation provide an excellent application and confirmation of studies done under controlled setting.
se of the study was to evaluate the performance and usability of the FreeStyle(®) Libre™ Flash glucose monitoring system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA) for interstitial glucose results compared with capillary blood glucose result.
wo study participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were enrolled by four U.S. clinical sites. A sensor was inserted on the back of each upper arm for up to 14 days. Three factory-only calibrated sensor lots were used in the study. Sensor glucose measurements were compared with capillary blood glucose (BG) results (approximately eight per day) obtained using the BG meter built into the reader (BG reference) and with the YSI analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument, Yellow Springs, OH) reference tests at three clinic visits (32 samples per visit). Sensor readings were masked to the participant.
acy of the results was demonstrated against capillary BG reference values, with 86.7% of sensor results within Consensus Error Grid Zone A. The percentage of readings within Consensus Error Grid Zone A on Days 2, 7, and 14 was 88.4%, 89.2%, and 85.2%, respectively. The overall mean absolute relative difference was 11.4%. The mean lag time between sensor and YSI reference values was 4.5±4.8 min. Sensor accuracy was not affected by factors such as body mass index, age, type of diabetes, clinical site, insulin administration, or hemoglobin A1.
ial glucose measurements with the FreeStyle Libre system were found to be accurate compared with capillary BG reference values, with accuracy remaining stable over 14 days of wear and unaffected by patient characteristic.
ns in the apoptotic mechanisms that cause excessive or deficient programmed cell death have been linked to a wide array of pathological conditions. In this study, using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, we analyzed the expression of apoptosis-regulating miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-29a, and miR-34a) in 20 oral squamous cell carcinoma and 5 normal oral mucosa tissue samples. Bioinformatic algorithms were used to identify the target genes of these miRNAs (BCL2, CASP2, CASP7, CASP8, DIABLO). The expression transcript levels of the target genes were measured in 50 oral squamous cell carcinoma and 10 normal oral mucosa tissue samples. We observed downregulation of miR-15a, miR-29a, and miR-34a in 50, 75, and 70% of samples, respectively. miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, and miR-21 expression was normal in 80, 75, 90, and 60% of samples, respectively. BCL2 transcripts were downregulated in 60% of samples, and normal-like expression was observed for CASP2, CASP7, CASP8, and DIABLO transcripts in 66, 82, 68, and 60% of samples, respectively. BCL2 expression was negative to weak, and that of proteins CASP2, CASP7, CASP8, and DIABLO was moderate to&nbsp;strong. Our study provides evidence of alterations in the expression of apoptosis-regulating miRNAs and genes in the apoptotic pathway, demonstrating that regulation of apoptosis is a hallmark of oral squamous cell carcinoma pathogenesi.
 in ATP1A3 cause Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) by disrupting function of the neuronal Na+/K+ ATPase. Published studies to date indicate 2 recurrent mutations, D801N and E815K, and a more severe phenotype in the E815K cohort. We performed mutation analysis and retrospective genotype-phenotype correlations in all eligible patients with AHC enrolled in the US AHC Foundation registry from 1997-2012. Clinical data were abstracted from standardized caregivers' questionnaires and medical records and confirmed by expert clinicians. We identified ATP1A3 mutations by Sanger and whole genome sequencing, and compared phenotypes within and between 4 groups of subjects, those with D801N, E815K, other ATP1A3 or no ATP1A3 mutations. We identified heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations in 154 of 187 (82%) AHC patients. Of 34 unique mutations, 31 (91%) are missense, and 16 (47%) had not been previously reported. Concordant with prior studies, more than 2/3 of all mutations are clustered in exons 17 and 18. Of 143 simplex occurrences, 58 had D801N (40%), 38 had E815K (26%) and 11 had G937R (8%) mutations. Patients with an E815K mutation demonstrate an earlier age of onset, more severe motor impairment and a higher prevalence of status epilepticus. This study further expands the number and spectrum of ATP1A3 mutations associated with AHC and confirms a more deleterious effect of the E815K mutation on selected neurologic outcomes. However, the complexity of the disorder and the extensive phenotypic variability among subgroups merits caution and emphasizes the need for further studie.
LO is a mitochondrial proapoptotic protein that is released from mitochondria during apoptosis and counters the inhibitory activities of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, IAPs. By linkage analysis and candidate screening, we identified a heterozygous SMAC/DIABLO mutation, c.377C&gt;T (p.Ser126Leu, refers to p.Ser71Leu in the mature protein) in a six-generation Chinese kindred characterized by dominant progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss, designated as DFNA64. SMAC/DIABLO is highly expressed in human embryonic ears and is enriched in the developing mouse inner-ear hair cells, suggesting it has a role in the development and homeostasis of hair cells. We used a functional study to demonstrate that the SMAC/DIABLO(S71L) mutant, while retaining the proapoptotic function, triggers significant degradation of both wild-type and mutant SMAC/DIABLO and renders host mitochondria susceptible to calcium-induced loss of the membrane potential. Our work identifies DFNA64 as the human genetic disorder associated with SMAC/DIABLO malfunction and suggests that mutant SMAC/DIABLO(S71L) might cause mitochondrial dysfunctio.
nsic apoptotic pathway is characterized by the release of several mitochondrial intermembrane proteins into the cytosol of dying cells. It is unclear whether the release of these proteins follows a common or specific pathway. In the present report we show that survivin and, to a lesser extent, the survivin splice variant survivin DeltaEx3 regulate the specific liberation of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO), an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins binding protein, during apoptosis induced by etoposide, a DNA damaging agent. This antineoplastic drug induced posttranscriptional upregulation of survivin and survivin DeltaEx3. In turn, mitochondrial survivin associated with Smac/DIABLO, delaying its release. In addition, cytosolic survivin also stabilized the cytosolic levels of released Smac/DIABLO. These results provide an explanation for the observed differences in the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins in various apoptotic models and present a new mechanism for the anti-apoptotic effects of survivin in cancer cell.
 of apoptosis (IAP) proteins inhibit caspases, a function counteracted by IAP antagonists, insect Grim, HID, and Reaper and mammalian DIABLO/Smac. We now demonstrate that HtrA2, a mammalian homologue of the Escherichia coli heat shock-inducible protein HtrA, can bind to MIHA/XIAP, MIHB, and baculoviral OpIAP but not survivin. Although produced as a 50-kDa protein, HtrA2 is processed to yield an active serine protease with an N terminus similar to that of Grim, Reaper, HID, and DIABLO/Smac that mediates its interaction with XIAP. HtrA2 is largely membrane-associated in healthy cells, with a significant proportion observed within the mitochondria, but in response to UV irradiation, HtrA2 shifts into the cytosol, where it can interact with IAPs. HtrA2 can, like DIABLO/Smac, prevent XIAP inhibition of active caspase 3 in vitro and is able to counteract XIAP protection of mammalian NT2 cells against UV-induced cell death. The proapoptotic activity of HtrA2 in vivo involves both IAP binding and serine protease activity. Mutations of either the N-terminal alanine of mature HtrA2 essential for IAP interaction or the catalytic serine residue reduces the ability of HtrA2 to promote cell death, whereas a complete loss in proapoptotic activity is observed when both sites are mutate.
/CDK4 activity is upregulated in up to 50% of breast cancers and CDK4-mediated phosphorylation negatively regulates the TGFβ superfamily member Smad3. We sought to determine if CDK4 inhibition and doxorubicin chemotherapy could impact Smad3-mediated cell/colony growth and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Parental and cyclin D1-overexpressing MCF7 cells were treated with CDK4 inhibitor, doxorubicin, or combination therapy and cell proliferation, apoptosis, colony formation, and expression of apoptotic proteins were evaluated using an MTS assay, TUNEL staining, 3D Matrigel assay, and apoptosis array/immunoblotting. Study cells were also transduced with WT Smad3 or a Smad3 construct resistant to CDK4 phosphorylation (5M) and colony formation and expression of apoptotic proteins were assessed. Treatment with CDK4 inhibitor/doxorubicin combination therapy, or transduction with 5M Smad3, resulted in a similar decrease in colony formation. Treating cyclin D overexpressing breast cancer cells with combination therapy also resulted in the greatest increase in apoptosis, resulted in decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP, and impacted subcellular localization of pro-apoptotic Smac/DIABLO. Additionally, transduction of 5M Smad3 and doxorubicin treatment resulted in the greatest change in apoptotic protein expression. Collectively, this work showed the impact of CDK4 inhibitor-mediated, Smad3-regulated tumor suppression, which was augmented in doxorubicin-treated cyclin D-overexpressing study cell.
d mitochondria&#8209;derived activator of caspases (Smac), an antagonist of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), increases chemosensitivity in vitro. Survivin, an IAP family member, mediates cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. The present study investigated the correlation between Smac and survivin expression in primary breast cancer, and the sensitivity to anthracycline during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Pre&#8209;treatment biopsies and post&#8209;anthracycline treatment tumor sections were analyzed from 98 cases. Biomarker expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from clinical stage II and III anthracycline&#8209;based NAC&#8209;treated breast cancer. A univariate analysis indicated that the estrogen receptor (ER), Smac and survivin were significantly predictive of a pathological complete response (pCR) (P=0.004, 0.001 and 0.037, respectively) in pre&#8209;chemotherapy samples. ER, Smac and survivin expression was also significant for pCR on the multivariate analysis (P=0.001, 0.031 and 0.012, respectively). An inverse association was identified between survivin and Smac expression (r=&#8209;0.217, P=0.032; and r=&#8209;0.335, P=0.003, respectively) prior to and following NAC. The patients with low survivin expression or high Smac expression had significantly longer disease&#8209;free survival (DFS; P=0.012 and P=0.020, respectively) and overall survival (OS; P=0.01 and P=0.033, respectively) compared with the patients with high survivin or low Smac expression. Cox regression analyses demonstrated that survivin, Smac and clinical stage were independent predictors for DFS and OS. The present study indicated the significance of Smac and survivin in determining the breast cancer response to anthracycline&#8209;based chemotherapy, and may permit further stratifying of pre&#8209;chemotherapy patients to undertake more tailored treatment.
is a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family; its overexpression has been widely demonstrated to occur in various types of cancer. Overexpression of survivin also correlates with tumor progression and induces anticancer drug resistance. Interestingly, recent studies reveal that survivin exhibits multiple pro-mitotic and anti-apoptotic functions; the differential functions of survivin seem to be caused by differential subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and acetylation of this molecule. In this review, the complex expression regulations and post-translational modifications of survivin are discussed. This review also discusses how recent discoveries improve our understanding of survivin biology and also create opportunities for developing differential-functioned survivin-targeted therapy. Databases such as PubMed, Scopus® (Elsevier, New York, NY, USA), and SciFinder® (CAS, Columbus, OH, USA) were used to search for literature in the preparation of this revie.
 an inhibitor of apoptosis, regulates cell division and is a potential target for anticancer drugs because many cancers express high survivin levels. However, whether survivin would be toxic to human lung cells and tissues has not been determined. This report clarified the involvement of survivin in acute lung injury. We used immunohistochemical analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to study survivin expression and localization in injured mouse and human lungs. We also used cultured human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B and A549) to study survivin cytoprotection. Nuclei and cytoplasm of epithelial cells in day 3 and day 7 models of bleomycin-injured lung showed survivin-positive results, which is consistent with upregulated survivin mRNA expression. These nuclei also evidenced double positive findings for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and survivin. Day 7 models had similar Smac/DIABLO-positive and survivin-positive cell distributions. The cytoplasm and nuclei of epithelial cells in lesions with diffuse alveolar damage manifested strong survivin-positive findings. Bleomycin stimulation in both epithelial cell lines upregulated expression of survivin and apoptosis-related molecules. Suppression of survivin expression with small interfering RNA rendered human lung epithelial cells susceptible to bleomycin-induced damage, with markedly upregulated activation of caspase-3, caspase-7, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and lactate dehydrogenase activity and an increased number of dead cells compared with mock small interfering RNA-treated cells. Overexpression of survivin via transfection resulted in these epithelial cells being resistant to bleomycin-induced cell damage, with reduced activation of apoptosis-related molecules and lactate dehydrogenase activity and fewer dead cells compared with results for mock-transfected cells. Survivin, acting at the epithelial cell level that depends partly on apoptosis inhibition, is therefore a key mediator of cytoprotection in acute lung injury. Understanding the precise role of survivin in normal lung cells is required for the development of therapeutic survivi.
e the expression of Smac(second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase)and survivin on the growth, development, recurrence and carcinogenesis of the sinonasal inverted papilloma(NIP.
tochemical method was used to detective the expression of Smac and survivin in 10 cases of (nasal cavity mucosae, NM), 45 cases of NIP. The NIP group including 25 cases of NIP without dysplasia, 11 cases of NIP with dysplasia, and 9 cases of NIP with malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma(SCC.
sity of the positive expression of Smac in NIP was lower than NM, the intensity of the positive expression decreased with the decreasing degree of histological differentiation. There was significantly difference between NIP without dysplasia and SCC. The expression of survivin was negative in the control group, the expression intensity of NIP was enhanced. The degree of histological differentiation was lower, the intensity of the positive expression was higher. The expression between NIP without dysplasia and SCC had significantly differences. Smac negatively correlated with survivin(rs = -0.403, P&lt;0.01.
survivin were associated with the growth and carcinogenesis of NI.
s of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) can play an important role in inhibiting apoptosis by exerting their negative action on caspases (apoptotic proteins). There are eight proteins in this family: NAIP/BIRC1/NLRB, cellular IAP1 (cIAP1)/human IAP2/BIRC2, cellular IAP2 (cIAP2)/human IAP1/BIRC3, X-linked IAP (XIAP)/BIRC4, survivin/BIRC5, baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR)-containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/apollon/BIRC6, livin/melanoma-IAP (ML-IAP)/BIRC7/KIAP, and testis-specific IAP (Ts-IAP)/hILP-2/BIRC8. Deregulation of these inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) may push cell toward cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) may provide new target for anticancer therapy. Drugs may be developed that are inhibiting these IAPs to induce apoptosis in cancerous cell.
toma are pediatric tumors of the sympathetic nervous system with a poor prognosis. Apoptosis is often deregulated in cancer cells, but only a few defects in apoptotic routes have been identified in neuroblastom.
nvestigated genomic aberrations affecting genes of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in neuroblastoma. We analyzed DNA profiling data (CGH and SNP arrays) and mRNA expression data of 31 genes of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dataset of 88 neuroblastoma tumors using the R2 bioinformatic platform ( http://r2.amc.nl). BIRC6 was selected for further analysis as a tumor driving gene. Knockdown experiments were performed using BIRC6 lentiviral shRNA and phenotype responses were analyzed by Western blot and MTT-assays. In addition, DIABLO levels and interactions were investigated with immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitatio.
ed frequent gain of the BIRC6 gene on chromosome 2, which resulted in increased mRNA expression. BIRC6 is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), that can bind and degrade the cytoplasmic fraction of the pro-apoptotic protein DIABLO. DIABLO mRNA expression was exceptionally high in neuroblastoma but the protein was only detected in the mitochondria. Upon silencing of BIRC6 by shRNA, DIABLO protein levels increased and cells went into apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed direct interaction between DIABLO and BIRC6 in neuroblastoma cell line.
ngs indicate that BIRC6 may have a potential oncogenic role in neuroblastoma by inactivating cytoplasmic DIABLO. BIRC6 inhibition may therefore provide a means for therapeutic intervention in neuroblastom.
eptor signaling pathway (NRSP) is increasingly linked to carcinogenesis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) appears to actively utilize this conserved developmental pathway. The aims of this study are to determine whether or not Notch 1-4 are overexpressed in NSCLC tissues compared with normal lung tissues and whether inhibiting NRSP could induce caspase-dependent or caspase-independent apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of Notch 1-4 in 101 NSCLC tissue samples and 30 normal lung tissue samples. DAPT was used to repress NRSP in SK-MES-1 cells. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin V and PI staining. Cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) was measured by Western blot; X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and Survivin were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot; the release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) from mitochondria to cytoplasm was evaluated by Western blot; the subcellular locations of endonuclease G (Endo G) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) were observed by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence analysis. (Mech Dev, 98, 2000, 95) Notch 1-4 are up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and Notch 1, 2 are positively correlated with lymph node metastasis, (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 106, 2009, 22293) DAPT treatment could inhibit NRSP and induce apoptosis, with a marked increase in cleaved PARP, decreases in XIAP and Survivin proteins and concomitant release of Smac, EndoG, and AIF from mitochondria, indicating that inhibiting NRSP by DAPT triggers caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosi.
e the effects of tumor-suppressing gene wild type PTEN on the cell proliferation, apoptosis and the possible regulations of apoptosis-related molecules Survivin, Xiap and Smac gene in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and cell line K562 cell.
ecombinant adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and PTEN (Ad-PTEN-GFP) or empty vector (Ad-GFP) was transfected into K562 cells. The growth of K562 cells was observed by MTT assay while cell cycle and apoptotic rate were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM). PTEN, Survivin, Xiap and Smac mRNA levels were detected by real-time fluorescent relative-quantification reverse transcriptional PCR (FQ-PCR) while PTEN protein levels analyzed by Western blot. (2) The expression levels of PTEN, Survivin, Xiap and Smac mRNA were detected in 10 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CML-CP), 10 CML patients in blast crises (CML-BC) and 10 normal control marrow mononuclear cells (MMNC.
h of K562 cells was suppressed markedly. And the maximal growth inhibition rate was 38.6% after the transfection of PTEN. Survivin, Xiap, Smac mRNA expression levels were down-regulated by around 6.14, 7.44 and 2.95 folds respectively (0.0700 ± 0.0059, 0.0089 ± 0.0006, 0.0600 ± 0.0039 vs 0.4370 ± 0.0790, 0.0661 ± 0.0072, 0.1580 ± 0.0078 vs 0.4530 ± 0.0810, 0.0700 ± 0.0079, 0.1770 ± 0.0085, all P &lt; 0.01). The mRNA expression level of PTEN in CML-BC patients was lower than that in CML-CP patients and normal control. But Survivin, Xiap, Smac mRNA expression levels were higher in CML-BC patients than those in CML-CP and normal contro.
expression of PTEN gene may inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and promote cell apoptosis via the regulation of Survivin, Xiap and Smac gene.
is an inhibitor of apoptosis family protein implicated in apoptosis and mitosis. In apoptosis, it has been shown to recognize the Smac/DIABLO protein. It is also a component of the chromosomal passenger complex, a key player during mitosis. Recently, Survivin was identified in vitro and in vivo as the direct binding partner for phosphorylated Thr3 on histone H3 (H3T3ph). We have undertaken structural and binding studies to investigate the molecular basis underlying recognition of H3T3ph and Smac/DIABLO N-terminal peptides by Survivin. Our crystallographic studies establish recognition of N-terminal Ala in both complexes and identify intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions in the Survivin phosphate-binding pocket that contribute to H3T3ph mark recognition. In addition, our calorimetric data establish that Survivin binds tighter to the H3T3ph-containing peptide relative to the N-terminal Smac/DIABLO peptide, and this preference can be reversed through structure-guided mutations that increase the hydrophobicity of the phosphate-binding pocke.
an intimate relation between disturbance in survivin and SMAC/DIABLO expressions and cancer formation in many tissues; however, this was not confirmed in the primary breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between survivin and SMAC/DIABLO mRNA expressions in primary breast cancer using RT-PCR and their relationship to some of the risk factors (age, family history, breast-feeding, use of contraceptive pills and hormonal receptors). Breast cancer tissues were studied for the detection of the mRNA expression of survivin and SMAC/DIABLO. This was done by qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SMAC/DIABLO mRNA was detected by RT-PCR only in 1 sample in breast cancer tissues (6.25%). However, it was expressed in 16 out of 25 (64%) of the benign tumor tissues (P=0.00). In contrast, survivin mRNA was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, 36 out of 48 (75%) (P=0.00), while its expression was very low in benign tumor tissues, only 1 out of 37 (2.7%) (P=0.00). Expressions of SMAC/DIABLO and survivin were significantly reciprocal in breast cancer and benign tumor tissues. SMAC/DIABLO inhibits apoptosis of breast cancer cells by suppression of survivin. These two genes probably form an important link in the signaling pathway of formation of breast cancer cells, which may be chosen as therapeutic targets in the primary breast cance.
rvivin) is one of the genes located on chromosome arm 17q in the region that is often gained in neuroblastoma. BIRC5 is a protein in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway that interacts with XIAP and DIABLO leading to caspase-3 and caspase-9 inactivation. BIRC5 is also involved in stabilizing the microtubule-kinetochore dynamics. Based on the Affymetrix mRNA expression data, we here show that BIRC5 expression is strongly upregulated in neuroblastoma compared with normal tissues, adult malignancies, and non-malignant fetal adrenal neuroblasts. The over-expression of BIRC5 correlates with an unfavorable prognosis independent of the presence of 17q gain. Silencing of BIRC5 in neuroblastoma cell lines by various antisense molecules resulted in massive apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage and FACS analysis. As both the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the chromosomal passenger complex can be therapeutically targeted, we investigated in which of them BIRC5 exerted its essential anti-apoptotic role. Immunofluorescence analysis of neuroblastoma cells after BIRC5 silencing showed formation of multinucleated cells indicating mitotic catastrophe, which leads to apoptosis via P53 and CASP2. We show that BIRC5 silencing indeed resulted in activation of P53 and we could rescue apoptosis by CASP2 inhibition. We conclude that BIRC5 stabilizes the microtubules in the chromosomal passenger complex in neuroblastoma and that the apoptotic response results from mitotic catastrophe, which makes BIRC5 an interesting target for therap.
e the effects of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) on proliferation and apoptosis in gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 cells and the molecular mechanisms induced by ASOD.
ASODN-1, survivin ASODN-2 and survivin ASODN-3 were transfected into BGC-823 cells by Lipofectamine(TM) 2000 transfection reagent. The growth activity of BGC-823 cells was detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis index (AI), proliferation index (PI), cell cycle and expressions of survivin, VEGF and Smac/DIABLO proteins were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The changes of survivin mRNA, VEGF mRNA and Smac/DIABLO mRNA were detected by RT-PC.
ssion of survivin was down-regulated by the three ASODN sequences, especially the ASODN-2 was best. At 48 hours after transfection with 600 nmol/L survivin ASODN-2, the cells in G(1)/G(0) phase were significantly increased [(72.25 ± 2.95)%], apoptotic index increased [(11.31 ± 0.38)%], proliferation index decreased [(27.77 ± 2.97)%], compared with those in the control group [(56.25 ± 0.75)%, (1.62 ± 0.36)%, (43.80 ± 0.80)%, all P &lt; 0.05]. The survivin mRNA and protein levels (0.523 ± 0.091, 0.733 ± 0.009) were down-regulated compared with those in the control group (0.861 ± 0.047, 0.997 ± 0.233), VEGF (0.519 ± 0.076, 0.75 ± 0.006) were down-regulated compared with those in the control group (0.779 ± 0.059, 1.000 ± 0.01), while those of Smac/DIABLO(0.899 ± 0.113, 1.637 ± 0.023)were up-regulated compared with those in the control group (0.558 ± 0.041, 1.000 ± 0.049, all P &lt; 0.05.
ASODN can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 cells. Those effects are induced through up-regulation of Smac/DIABLO and down-regulation of survivin and VEGF expression simultaneousl.
e to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is a serious problem in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Using Western blot, real-time qRT-PCR and flow cytometry, we investigated the expression of survivin, Smac/DIABLO and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in patients with CML. Survivin overexpression has been associated with cancer progression, multidrug resistance, poor prognosis and short survival in several types of neoplasms including hematological malignancies. In this work, survivin expression was significantly elevated in late, in contrast to early, chronic phase CML (p=0.044). Patients with high or intermediate prognostic Sokal score presented higher survivin levels (p=0.012), as well as Smac/DIABLO levels (p=0.009) compared to low Sokal score. The strong correlation between survivin and Pgp expression in late (p=0.018), but not in early (p=0.5) chronic phase of CML, suggests that this association may play a biological role in late CML phase and may offer an important target for the development of new therapie.
was initially described as an inhibitor of apoptosis and attracted growing attention as one of the most tumor-specific genes in the human genome and a promising target for cancer therapy. Lately, it has been shown that survivin is a multifunctional protein that takes part in several crucial cell processes. At first, it was supposed that survivin functions only as a homodimer, but now data indicate that many processes require monomeric survivin. Moreover, recent studies reveal a special mechanism regulating the balance between monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein. In this paper we studied the mutant form of survivin that was unable to dimerize and investigated its role in apoptosis. We showed that survivin monomer interacts with Smac/DIABLO and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) both in vitro and in vivo. Due to this feature, it protects cells from caspase-dependent apoptosis even more efficiently than the wild-type survivin. We also identified that mutant monomeric survivin prevents apoptosis-inducing factor release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, protecting human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells from caspase-independent apoptosis. On the other hand, our results indicate that only wild-type survivin, but not the monomer mutant form, enhances tubulin stability in cells. These findings suggest that survivin partly performs its functions as a monomer and partly as a dimer. The mechanism of dimer-monomer balance regulation may also work as a &quot;switcher&quot; between survivin functions and thereby explain remarkable functional diversities of this protei.
mia is a promising treatment for human cervical cancer. However, little is known about whether and under what conditions heat treatment exerts tumor inhibition effects on cervical cancer, and the molecular mechanisms behind these cellular responses have yet to be elucidated. We employed the human cervical cancer cell line CaSki as a cellular model and examined the effect of cell apoptosis and proliferation under gradient thermal conditions (43, 45 and 47˚C for 40 min). Heat treatment was found to induce CaSki cell apoptosis and necrosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that cells were arrested in S phase upon the application of hyperthermia, and MTT analysis revealed that cell viability was also reduced. Of the thermal conditions, 45˚C exhibited the best induction of apoptosis, while 47˚C induced direct fierce necrosis. This was further demonstrated by examining the expression level of several key apoptosis-related genes: caspase-3, Smac and Survivin. During apoptosis, caspase-3 and Smac levels were up-regulated, whereas anti-apoptotic Survivin was down-regulated, enhancing programmed cell death. Our results reveal that heating at ≥45˚C induced cell apoptosis and necrosis, and inhibited cell proliferation at both the cellular and molecular levels. These findings support the use of hyperthermia in a clinical setting for the treatment of human cervical cance.
ike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) inhibits 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu)-induced apoptosis in esophageal carcinoma cells; however, the mechanisms for IGF-1-induced 5-Fu chemoresistance remain unknown. In the human esophageal carcinoma cell line, CE48T/VGH, we show that IGF-1 up-regulated survivin expression at the post-transcriptional level and this up-regulation is mediated by both the PI3-K/Akt and casein kinase 2 signaling pathways. We then examine whether IGF-1-induced 5-Fu chemoresistance is mediated through up-regulation of survivin. Ectopic expression of survivin inhibits 5-Fu-induced apoptosis; furthermore, the abolition of survivin expression sensitizes cells to 5-Fu treatment and prevents the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1 in esophageal carcinoma cell lines. We also found that ectopic expression of survivin or treatment with IGF-1 inhibits the release of Smac/DIABLO and caspases activation after 5-Fu treatment. Our results strongly suggest that IGF-1 inhibits 5-Fu induced apoptosis through increasing survivin levels, which prevents Smac/DIABLO release and blocks the activation of caspases. Therefore, up-regulation of IGF-1 and survivin would seem to be responsible for 5-Fu chemoresistance in esophageal cancer patients and these factors may be the valuable predictors of 5-Fu chemoresistance in esophageal carcinom.
 as an apoptosis suppressor, exists as a homodimer interfacing at the N-terminal portion (residues 6-13) of its baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain and a linker segment (residues 89-102). Here we expressed full-length human Survivin (SurF) and a series of its mutants, SurΔN7, SurΔN13, and SurΔN18 with significant truncations of the N-terminus, all of which could still dimerize in solution. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was used to quantitate the unbinding forces of full-length and the mutant homodimers and revealed that the N-terminal residues up to Arg18 were not essential for dimerization. Meanwhile, the binding of SurΔN7 to Smac/DIABLO determined by ELISA was as efficient as the wild-type, but that of SurΔN13 was significantly reduced, and that of SurΔN18 was completely lost. Together, these findings provide direct evidence that the N-terminal sequence of Survivin is not critical for dimer formation but may contribute to correct folding and function of BI.
igate the expressions and significances of Survivin and Smac in ovarian mucinous tumor.
f 55 paraffin-embedded specimens of primary ovarian mucinous tumors were collected. SABC was used to detect protein expression of Survivin and Smac genes. Immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold labeling was performed to determine the subcellular localization and patterns of Smac protein expressio.
ytoplasmic expression rates of survivin in benign, borderline and malignant ovarian mucinous tumors were 2/20, 12/15 and 20/20 respectively, which presents an improving trend.There were significant differences of survivin expression between benign vs. borderline lesions (P &lt; 0.01), and benign vs. malignant tumors (P &lt; 0.01). The nuclear expression rates of survivin in benign, borderline and malignant ovarian mucinous tumors were 1/20, 6/15 and 5/20, respectively, which presents a.declining trend.There was significant difference of survivin expression between benign vs. borderline tumors (P &lt; 0.05). The positive expression rates of Smac among the three groups were 19/20, 9/15 and 3/20, respectively. There was significant difference among the three groups (P &lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.05). There was a negative correlation between Survivin and Smac (r = -0.153, P &lt; 0.01). (2) Colloidal gold labeling study demonstrated that mitochondrion intramembranous storage of Smac granules in the three groups were 24.1 ± 7.2, 11.1 ± 1.9 and 5.2 ± 1.7, respectively, and there were significant differences among the three groups (P &lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.05). The extramemebranous Smac granules were 4.7 ± 3.0, 2.9 ± 1.0 and 1.7 ± 1.3, although without significant difference among the three groups (P &gt; 0.05.
malignant development of ovarian mucinous tumors, the expressions of Survivin are up-regulated, and the expressions of Smac are down-regulated. Smac proteins exist mainly in an inactive intramembranous storage form inside of mitochondri.
ria-mediated apoptosis plays a central role in animal development and tissue homeostasis, and mitochondria contain several pro-apoptotic proteins that have key roles in apoptosis. Smac/DIABLO was identified as a mitochondrial protein that is released into the cytosol following apoptotic stimuli, subsequently blocking the anti-apoptotic activity of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Through expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis we detected evidence for the presence of a number of Xenopus counterparts to mammalian mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. EST and genome sequencing provides evidence for the presence of endonuclease G, AIF, HtrA/Omi and Smac/DIABLO in Xenopus laevis and tropicalis. Here we report the cloning and characterization of X. laevis Smac/DIABLO (XSmac/DIABLO). In this study degenerate primers based on conserved regions of human, mouse and an EST predicted Smac from X. tropicalis were used to amplify cDNA templates from X. laevis. The full length cDNA of Xenopus Smac contained a complete open reading frame of 732 bp, encoding 244 amino acids, that when expressed is observed to be approximately 27 kDa in size. The protein sequence is 49% identical and 71% similar to human Smac, and includes the motifs involved in mitochondrial targeting, and IAP-binding (AIPV). Smac expression was detected throughout early development with multiple transcripts being detected by Northern blot analysis, suggesting the presence of alternatively spliced isoforms. Exogenous expression of Xenopus Smac enhances gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, demonstrating its functional equivalence with mammalian forms. Our study has identified the third vertebrate homologue of Smac/DIABLO, with its structural and functional similarities to mammalian Smac/DIABLO further illustrating the evolutionary conservation of apoptotic pathways across vertebrate specie.
P binding protein with low pI/second mitochondrial activator of caspases, HtrA2/Omi and GstPT/eRF3 are mammalian proteins that bind via N-terminal inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) binding motifs (IBMs) to the baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains of IAPs. These interactions can prevent IAPs from inhibiting caspases, or displace active caspases, thereby promoting cell death. We have identified several additional potential IAP antagonists, including glutamate dehydrogenase (GdH), Nipsnap 3 and 4, CLPX, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. All are mitochondrial proteins from which N-terminal import sequences are removed generating N-terminal IBMs. Whereas most of these proteins have alanine at the N-terminal position, as observed for previously described antagonists, GdH has an N-terminal serine residue that is essential for X-linked IAP (XIAP) interaction. These newly described IAP binding proteins interact with XIAP mainly via BIR2, with binding eliminated or significantly reduced by a single point mutation (D214S) within this domain. Through this interaction, many are able to antagonise XIAP inhibition of caspase 3 in vitr.
apoptotic proteins Bcl-w and Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax may mediate cell death or survival via regulation of the mitochondria including second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac)/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) release. This study aimed to explore alterations in Bcl-w, Bcl-2, and Bax and the relationship between these proteins and Smac/DIABLO by means of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and Western blots after low- and high-intensity photothrombotic ring stroke. At 4 h after low-intensity irradiation, we found widespread bcl-w overexpression on both the mRNA and protein levels in the bilateral cortex except the ring lesion region and in subcortical regions. A prolonged elevation of Bcl-2 with relatively unchanged Bax in the mitochondrial fraction was demonstrated from 4 to 72 h. These upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins combined with little Smac/DIABLO release might be associated with increased cell survival and thereby remarkable morphological recovery after low-intensity irradiation. After high-intensity irradiation, we observed decreased bcl-w and bcl-2 mRNA with increased Bcl-2 protein in the cytosolic fraction, whereas the Bax protein remained in scattered ischaemic cells in the ring lesion and the region at risk that corresponded with release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria to the cytosol at 1-24 h. These changes might be related to the massive cell death observed after high-intensity irradiation. Taken together, the balance and the location of anti-apoptotic proteins vs. pro-apoptotic proteins could be associated with the translocation of Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytosol and therefore closely related to cell death or survival after focal cerebral ischaemi.
very of an agent that selectively kills tumor cells and not normal cells is the dream of every cancer researcher. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), first discovered in 1995, was heralded as a selective killer of tumor cells, and its potential is still thought to be high. Almost immediately, broad efforts were made to understand its activity at the molecular level. TRAIL has been shown to interact with the cell surface through five distinct receptors, named death receptor (DR) 4, DR5, decoy receptor (Dc)R1, DcR2, and osteoprotegrin. It activates nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and apoptosis. The apoptotic signals are mediated through Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD)-mediated recruitment of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Additionally, caspase-8 can cleave Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-interfering domain death agonist (Bid), and the cleaved Bid then causes the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, leading to the activation of pro-caspase-9, which can then activate pro-caspase-3. TRAIL-induced apoptosis is negatively regulated by numerous cellular factors including decoy receptors, cellular FADD-like interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme (FLICE) interacting protein (cFLIP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP), X-linked IAP (XIAP), survivin, and NF-kappaB. Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)?direct IAP binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) mediates proapoptotic signals through inaction of IAP. How the TRAIL-induced apoptosis is downregulated by these factors is discussed in detail in this review. Whether TRAIL selectively kills tumor cells without harming normal cells is also discusse.
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), the most potent member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis. XIAP is structurally characterized by three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains that mediate binding to and inhibition of caspases and a RING domain that confers ubiquitin ligase activity. The caspase inhibitory activity of XIAP can be eliminated by the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) during apoptosis. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel isoform of Smac/DIABLO named Smac3, which is generated by alternative splicing of exon 4. Smac3 contains an NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence required for mitochondrial targeting of Smac3 and an IAP-binding motif essential for Smac3 binding to XIAP. Smac3 is released from mitochondria into the cytosol in response to apoptotic stimuli, where it interacts with the second and third BIR domains of XIAP. Smac3 disrupts processed caspase-9 binding to XIAP, promotes caspase-3 activation, and potentiates apoptosis. Strikingly, Smac3, but not Smac/DIABLO, accelerates XIAP auto-ubiquitination and destruction. Smac3-stimulated XIAP ubiquitination is contingent upon the physical association of XIAP with Smac3 and an intact RING domain of XIAP. Smac3-accelerated XIAP destabilization is, at least in part, attributed to its ability to enhance XIAP ubiquitination. Our study demonstrates that Smac3 is functionally additive to, but independent of, Smac/DIABL.
crosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has attracted much attention because of its ability to kill tumour cells. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment of QGY-7703 cells with the combination of TRAIL and etoposide resulted in synergistic cytotoxic effects. In dissecting the mechanism underlying this synergistic effect, we found that treatment with etoposide alone resulted in the upregulation of Bax, while the level of truncated Bid (tBid) was unchanged. In contrast, while treatment with TRAIL alone significantly increased the level of tBid, the expression of Bax remained unaffected. The enhanced apoptosis was accompanied by an increased release of cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) from mitochondria, leading to the activation of cellular caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7, as well as poly ADP-ribose polymerase. This enhanced release of cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/DIABLO was inhibited by the general caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. The RT-PCR and Western blotting results demonstrated that the levels of both mRNA and protein for death receptor-4, death receptor-5 and decoy receptor-2 remained unchanged in response to etoposide, indicating that the synergistic effect of TRAIL and etoposide is not a result of increasing the expression for TRAIL receptors, but rather is associated with amplification of the mitochondrial signal pathwa.
enol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) antagonist, which is able to induce apoptosis in tumor cells independently of PPAR-gamma in caspase-dependent and -independent manners. Additionally, BADGE promotes TRAIL-induced apoptosis. (2) We report that BADGE activates via Bax and caspases-2 and -8 both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways using Bid as a shunt. (3) BADGE stimulates the mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low pl (Smac/DIABLO). The release of cytochrome c could not be blocked by inhibitors of caspases-3, -8 and -9 indicating that BADGE acts upstream of caspases-3 and -9 and does not involve caspase-8 to release cytochrome c. (4) While the caspase-independent apoptotic effect might be mediated by AIF, the sensitizing effect of BADGE against other apoptotic substances is most likely mediated by the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis inhibitor Smac/DIABLO. (5) Our data suggest that BADGE or BADGE derivatives could represent promising substances for the treatment of neoplasms improving the antitumoral activity of TRAI.
hemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) results in necrosis at the infarct core and activation of complex signal pathways for cell death and cell survival in the penumbra. Recent studies have shown activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of caspase-mediated cell death, as well as activation of the caspase-independent signaling pathway of apoptosis in several paradigms of focal cerebral ischemia by transient MCAO to adult rats and mice. The extrinsic pathway (cell-death receptor pathway) is initiated by activation of the Fas receptor after binding to the Fas ligand (Fas-L); increased Fas and Fas-L expression has been shown following focal ischemia. Moreover, focal ischemia is greatly reduced in mice expressing mutated (nonfunctional) Fas. Increased expression of caspase-1, -3, -8, and -9, and of cleaved caspase-8, has been observed in the penumbra. Activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway following focal ischemia is triggered by Bax translocation to and competition with Bcl-2 and other members of the Bcl-2 family in the mitochondria membrane that is followed by cytochrome c release to the cytosol. Bcl-2 over-expression reduces infarct size. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and dATP and recruits and cleaves pro-caspase-9 in the apoptosome. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activate caspase-3, among other caspases, which in turn cleave several crucial substrates, including the DNA-repairing enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), into fragments of 89 and 28 kDa. Inhibition of caspase-3 reduces the infarct size, further supporting caspase-3 activation following transient MCAO. In addition, caspase-8 cleaves Bid, the truncated form of which has the capacity to translocate to the mitochondria and induce cytochrome c release. The volume of brain infarct is greatly reduced in Bid-deficient mice, thus indicating activation of the mitochondrial pathway by cell-death receptors following focal ischemia. Recent studies have shown the mitochondrial release of other factors; Smac/DIABLO (Smac: second mitochondrial activator of caspases: DIABLO: direct IAP binding protein with low pI) binds to and neutralizes the effects of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). Finally, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocates to the mitochondria and the nucleus following focal ischemia and produces peripheral chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA strands, thus leading to the caspase-independent cell death pathway of apoptosis. Delineation of the pro-apoptotic and pro-survival signals in the penumbra may not only increase understanding of the process but also help to rationalize strategies geared to reducing brain damage targeted at the periphery of the infarct cor.
t of disruption of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway on the response of human leukemia cells to pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors has been examined. Exposure of U937 monocytic leukemia cells to minimally toxic concentrations of flavopiridol (FP), roscovitine, or CGP74514A for 3 h in conjunction with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (abbreviated LY in the article) resulted in a marked decrease in Akt phosphorylation. Coexposure of cells to LY and CDK inhibitors also resulted in an early (i.e., within 3 h) and striking increase in mitochondrial damage [e.g., cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/DIABLO), and apoptosis-initiating factor (AIF) release], caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were observed in a variety of other leukemia cell types (e.g., HL-60, Jurkat, Raji, and NB4). Apoptosis, induced by FP/LY, was substantially blocked by ectopic expression of Bcl-2, but to a considerably lesser extent by dominant-negative caspase-8. FP-induced apoptosis was not enhanced by agents that inhibited protein kinase (PK) A (H89), PKC (GFX), mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK1/2; U0126), p38 MAP kinase (MAPK; SB202190), m-target of rapamycin (TOR; rapamycin), or ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM; caffeine), whereas the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin exerted effects similar to those of LY. The dramatic potentiation of CDK inhibitor-induced apoptosis by LY was accompanied by diminished Bad phosphorylation, induction of Bcl-2 cleavage, and down-regulation of X-linked IAP (XIAP) and Mcl-1. Cells exposed to CDK inhibitors + LY also exhibited reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), p70(S6K), and ERK, but increased activation of p34(cdc2) and p38 MAPK. LY/CDK inhibitor-treated cells also displayed diminished pRb dephosphorylation on CDK2- and CDK4-specific sites, retinoblastoma protein cleavage, and down-regulation of cyclin D(1). Inducible expression of constitutively active (myristolated) Akt significantly, albeit partially, attenuated apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia cells treated with either FP alone or the combination of FP and LY. Finally, cotreatment with LY and FP resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis in primary leukemic blasts obtained from a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Together, these findings suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a major role in regulating the apoptotic response of human leukemia cells to pharmacological CDK inhibitors and raise the possibility that combined interruption of CDK- and PI3K-related pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in hematological malignancie.
ts of combined exposure to the checkpoint abrogator UCN-01 and pharmacologic MEK1/2 inhibitors were examined in human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. Treatment of RPMI8226, NCI-H929, and U266 MM cells with a minimally toxic concentration of UCN-01 (150 nM) for 24 hours resulted in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, an effect that was blocked by coadministration of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352. These events were accompanied by enhanced activation of p34(cdc2) and a marked increase in mitochondrial damage (loss of DeltaPsim; cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (direct IAP binding protein with low pI) release), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and apoptosis. PD184352/UCN-01 also dramatically reduced clonogenic survival in each of the MM cell lines. In contrast to As(2)0(3), apoptosis induced by PD184352/UCN-01 was not blocked by the free-radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Whereas exogenous interleukin 6 substantially prevented dexamethasone-induced lethality in MM cells, it was unable to protect them from PD184352/UCN-01-induced apoptosis despite enhancing Akt activation. Insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) also failed to diminish apoptosis induced by this drug regimen. MM cell lines selected for a high degree of resistance to doxorubicin, melphalan, or dexamethasone, or displaying resistance secondary to fibronectin-mediated adherence, remained fully sensitive to PD184352/UCN-01-induced cell death. Finally, primary CD138(+) MM cells were also susceptible to UCN-01/MEK inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. Together, these findings suggest that simultaneous disruption of cell cycle and MEK/MAP kinase signaling pathways provides a potent stimulus for mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in MM cells, and also indicate that this strategy bypasses the block to cell death conferred by several other well-described resistance mechanism.
n apoptosis regulation are one main cause of cancer development and may result from overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). IAPs are cell death regulators that, among other functions, bind caspases, and interfere with apoptotic signaling via death receptors or intrinsic cell death pathways. All IAPs share one to three common structures, the so called baculovirus-IAP-repeat (BIR)-domains that allow them to bind caspases and other proteins. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is the most potent and best-defined anti-apoptotic IAP family member that directly neutralizes caspase-9 via its BIR3 domain and the effector caspases-3 and -7 via its BIR2 domain. A natural inhibitor of XIAP is SMAC/Diablo, which is released from mitochondria in apoptotic cells and displaces bound caspases from the BIR2/BIR3 domains of XIAP thereby reactivating cell death execution. The central apoptosis-inhibitory function of XIAP and its overexpression in many different types of advanced cancers have led to significant efforts to identify therapeutics that neutralize its anti-apoptotic effect. Most of these drugs are chemical derivatives of the N-terminal part of SMAC/Diablo. These &quot;SMAC-mimetics&quot; either specifically induce apoptosis in cancer cells or act as drug-sensitizers. Several &quot;SMAC-mimetics&quot; are currently tested by the pharmaceutical industry in Phase I and Phase II trials. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in understanding the function of IAPs in normal and malignant cells and focus on approaches to specifically neutralize XIAP in cancer cell.
ation of therapeutic strategies that might enhance the efficacy of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) inhibitor ABT-737 [N-{4-[4-(4-chloro-biphenyl-2-ylmethyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-benzoyl}-4-(3-dimethylamino-1-phenylsulfanylmethyl-propylamino)-3-nitro-benzenesulfonamide] is of great interest in many cancers, including glioma. Our recent study suggested that Akt is a crucial mediator of apoptosis sensitivity in response to ABT-737 in glioma cell lines. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt are currently being assessed clinically in patients with glioma. Because PI3K/Akt inhibition would be expected to have many proapoptotic effects, we hypothesized that there may be unique synergy between PI3K inhibitors and Bcl-2 homology 3 mimetics. Toward this end, we assessed the combination of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor NVP-BKM120 [5-(2,6-dimorpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine] and the Bcl-2 family inhibitor ABT-737 in established and primary cultured glioma cells. We found that the combined treatment with these agents led to a significant activation of caspase-8 and -3, PARP, and cell death, irrespective of PTEN status. The enhanced lethality observed with this combination also appears dependent on the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor to the cytosol. Further study revealed that the upregulation of Noxa, truncation of Bid, and activation of Bax and Bak caused by these inhibitors were the key factors for the synergy. In addition, we demonstrated the release of proapoptotic proteins Bim and Bak from Mcl-1. We found defects in chromosome segregation leading to multinuclear cells and loss of colony-forming ability, suggesting the potential use of NVP-BKM120 as a promising agent to improve the anticancer activities of ABT-73.
sition of apoptosis resistance is a fundamental event in cancer development. Among the mechanisms used by cancer cells to evade apoptosis is the dysregulation of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. The activity of the IAPs is regulated by endogenous IAP antagonists such as SMAC (also termed DIABLO). Antagonism of IAP proteins by SMAC occurs via binding of the N-terminal tetrapeptide (AVPI) of SMAC to selected BIR domains of the IAPs. Small molecule compounds that mimic the AVPI motif of SMAC have been designed to overcome IAP-mediated apoptosis resistance of cancer cells. Here, we report the preclinical characterization of birinapant (TL32711), a bivalent SMAC-mimetic compound currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Birinapant bound to the BIR3 domains of cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, and the BIR domain of ML-IAP in vitro and induced the autoubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 in intact cells, which resulted in formation of a RIPK1:caspase-8 complex, caspase-8 activation, and induction of tumor cell death. Birinapant preferentially targeted the TRAF2-associated cIAP1 and cIAP2 with subsequent inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation. The activity of a variety of chemotherapeutic cancer drugs was potentiated by birinapant both in a TNF-dependent or TNF-independent manner. Tumor growth in multiple primary patient-derived xenotransplant models was inhibited by birinapant at well-tolerated doses. These results support the therapeutic combination of birinapant with multiple chemotherapies, in particular, those therapies that can induce TNF secretio.
studies have demonstrated that neuronal cell death occurs via extrinsic (death receptors) and intrinsic (mitochondria) pathways. Radiation induces caspase activation fundamentally via the mitochondrial pathway. To investigate the role of caspase, a cell permeable pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk [N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone], was used to investigate the effects of caspase blockade in vivo following irradiation. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 250-300 g) underwent irradiation at room temperature with a 4-Gy dose of radiation. Since z-VAD-fmk does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, it was applied intracerebroventricularly via a bolus injection (0.2 μg/h for 1 h). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) demonstrated that z-VAD-fmk reduced the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells within the hypoglossal nucleus, suggesting that intervention in the caspase cascade following radiation may have therapeutic applications. The caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk reduced the expression and activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in the irradiated rats, indicating that caspase may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of brain radiation injury. Treatment with z-VAD-fmk also reduced the appearance of cytochrome c within the cytosolic fraction following radiation. The hypoglossal nucleus may be used as a model of radiation-induced injury in the central nervous system, providing visual information and displaying apoptotic nuclear morpholog.
, unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is primarily treated by chemoradiotherapy. However, the outcome has not improved significantly due to radioresistance of cancer cells. This study aimed to determine the radiosensitizing effect of LCL161, a novel second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase (Smac) mimetic, in ESCC cells. ESCC cell lines were treated with LCL161 or radiation, alone or in combination. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. Radiosensitization was evaluated by clonogenic survival assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that LCL161 potently sensitized ESCC cells to radiation with a sensitization enhancement ratio of 1.4-2.0. LCL161 increased radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks and promoted the apoptosis of ESCC cells, which could be abrogated by a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK. Furthermore, LCL161 decreased the level of cIAP1 in ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner and synthesized with irradiation to promote the activation of caspase 8 and the upregulation of TNFα expression in ESCC cells. In conclusion, LCL161 acts as a strong radiosensitizer in human esophageal cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of cIAP1 and promoting the activation of caspase 8, leading to enhanced apoptosi.
minal sequence of the Smac/DIABLO protein is known to be involved in binding to the BIR3 domain of the anti-apoptotic proteins IAPs, antagonizing their action. Short peptides and peptide mimetics based on the first 4-residues of Smac/DIABLO have been demonstrated to re-sensitize resistant cancer cells, over-expressing IAPs, to apoptosis. Based on the well-defined structural basis for this interaction, a small focused library of C-terminal capped Smac/DIABLO-derived peptides was designed in silico using docking to the XIAP BIR3 domain. The top-ranked computational hits were conveniently synthesized employing Solid Phase Synthesis (SPS) on an alkane sulfonamide 'Safety-Catch' resin. This novel approach afforded the rapid synthesis of the target peptide library with high flexibility for the introduction of various C-terminal amide-capping groups. The library members were obtained in high yield (&gt;65%) and purity (&gt;85%), upon nucleophilic release from the activated resin by treatment with various amine nucleophiles. In vitro caspase-9 activity reconstitution assays of the peptides in the presence of the recombinant BIR3-domain of human XIAP (500nM) revealed N-methylalanyl-tertiarybutylglycinyl-4-(R)-phenoxyprolyl-N-biphenylmethyl carboxamide (11a) to be the most potent XIAP BIR3 antagonist of the series synthesized inducing 93% recovery of caspase-9 activity, when used at 1μM concentration. Compound (11a) also demonstrated moderate cytotoxicity against the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, compared to the Smac/DIABLO-derived wild-type peptide sequences that were totally inactive in the same cell line.
oma skin cancers (NMSCs), one of the most common neoplasms, cause serious morbidity and mortality. Therefore, identification of non-toxic phytochemicals for prevention/treatment of NMSCs is highly desirable. Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone), a dietary flavonoid, present in fruits and vegetables possesses anti-oxidant and antiproliferative properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the chemotherapeutic potential of fisetin in cultured human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Treatment of A431 cells with fisetin (5-80 μm) resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Employing clonogenic assay, we found that fisetin treatment significantly reduced colony formation in A431 cells. Fisetin treatment of A431 cells resulted in G₂ /M arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of A431 cells with fisetin resulted in (i) decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2; Bcl-xL and Mcl-1); (ii) increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak and Bad); (iii) disruption of mitochondrial potential; (iv) release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria; (v) activation of caspases; and (vi) cleavage of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. Pretreatment of A431 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) blocked fisetin-induced cleavage of caspases and PARP. Taken together, these data provide evidence that fisetin possesses chemotherapeutic potential against human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Overall, these results suggest that fisetin could be developed as a novel therapeutic agent for the management of NMSC.
actor kappa B (NF-κB) has been implicated in anesthetic preconditioning (APC) induced protection against anoxia and reoxygenation (A/R) injury. The authors hypothesized that desflurane preconditioning would induce NF-κB oscillation and prevent endothelial cells apoptosi.
mbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) A/R injury model was used. A 30 minute desflurane treatment was initiated before anoxia. NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7082 was administered in some experiments before desflurane preconditioning. Cells apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and cell viability was evaluated by modified tertrozalium salt (MTT) assay. The cellular superoxide dismutases (SOD) activitiy were tested by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. NF-κB p65 subunit nuclear translocation was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Expression of inhibitor of NF-κB-α (IκBα), NF-κB p65 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (c-IAP1), B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cysteine containing aspartate specific protease 3 (caspases-3) and second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase (SMAC/DIABLO) were determined by western blo.
e preconditioning caused phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB before anoxia, on the contrary, induced the synthesis of IκBα and inhibition of NF-κB after reoxygenation. Desflurane preconditioning up-regulated the expression of c-IAP1 and Bcl-2, blocked the cleavage of caspase-3 and reduced SMAC release, and decreased the cell death of HUVECs after A/R. The protective effect was abolished by BAY11-7082 administered before desfluran.
ts demonstrated that desflurane activated NF-κB during the preconditioning period and inhibited excessive activation of NF-κB in reperfusion. And the oscillation of NF-κB induced by desflurane preconditioning finally up-regulated antiapoptotic proteins expression and protected endothelial cells against A/.
a group of regulatory proteins that are structurally related. Their conserved homologues have been identified in various organisms. In human, eight IAP members have been recognized based on baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains. IAPs are key regulators of apoptosis, cytokinesis and signal transduction. The antiapoptotic property of IAPs depends on their professional role for caspases. IAPs are functionally non-equivalent and regulate effector caspases through distinct mechanisms. IAPs impede apoptotic process via membrane receptor-dependent (extrinsic) cascade and mitochondrial dependent (intrinsic) pathway. IAP-mediated apoptosis affects the progression of liver diseases. Therapeutic options of liver diseases may depend on the understanding toward mechanisms of the IAP-mediated apoptosi.
oma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. GBM cells are highly resistant to apoptosis induced by antitumor drugs and radiotherapy resulting in cancer progression. We assessed whether a systems medicine approach, analysing the ability of tumor cells to execute apoptosis could be utilized to predict the response of GBM patients to treatment. Concentrations of the key proapoptotic proteins procaspase-3, procaspase-9, Smac and Apaf-1 and the antiapopotic protein XIAP were determined in a panel of GBM cell lines and GBM patient tumor resections. These values were used as input for APOPTO-CELL, a systems biological based mathematical model built to predict cellular susceptibility to undergo caspase activation. The modeling was capable of accurately distinguishing between GBM cells that die or survive in response to treatment with temozolomide in 10 of the 11 lines analysed. Importantly the results obtained using GBM patient samples show that APOPTO-CELL was capable of stratifying patients according to their progression-free survival times and predicted the ability of tumor cells to support caspase activation in 16 of the 21 GBM patients analysed. Calculating the susceptibility to apoptosis execution may be a potent tool in predicting GBM patient therapy responsiveness and may allow for the use of APOPTO-CELL in a clinical settin.
esigned, synthesized, and evaluated a series of new compounds based upon our previously reported bivalent Smac mimetics. This led to the identification of compound 12 (SM-1200), which binds to XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 with Ki values of 0.5, 3.7, and 5.4 nM, respectively, inhibits cell growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 11.0 and 28.2 nM, respectively. Compound 12 has a much improved pharmacokinetic profile over our previously reported bivalent Smac mimetics and is highly effective in induction of rapid and durable tumor regression in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. These data indicate that compound 12 is a promising Smac mimetic and warrants extensive evaluation as a potential candidate for clinical developmen.
 microenvironment is a key determinant for radio-responsiveness. Immune cells play an important role in shaping tumor microenvironments; however, there is limited understanding of how natural killer (NK) cells can enhance radiation effects. This study aimed to assess the mechanism of reciprocal complementation of radiation and NK cells on tumor killing. Various tumor cell lines were co-cultured with human primary NK cells or NK cell line (NK-92) for short periods and then exposed to irradiation. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and transwell assays were performed to assess apoptotic efficacy and cell viability. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation methods were used to determine XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) expression and interaction in tumor cells. Co-culture did not induce apoptosis in tumor cells, but a time- and dose-dependent enhancing effect was found when co-cultured cells were irradiated. A key role for caspase activation via perforin/granzyme B (Grz B) after cell-cell contact was determined, as the primary radiation enhancing effect. The efficacy of NK cell killing was attenuated by upregulation of XIAP to bind caspase-3 in tumor cells to escape apoptosis. Knockdown of XIAP effectively potentiated NK cell-mediated apoptosis. Radiation induced Smac released from mitochondria and neutralized XIAP and therefore increased the NK killing. Our findings suggest NK cells in tumor microenvironment have direct radiosensitization effect through Grz B injection while radiation enhances NK cytotoxicity through triggering Smac releas.
tor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins can regulate additional signaling pathways beyond apoptosis, we investigated the effect of the second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac) mimetic BV6, which antagonizes IAP proteins, on non-apoptotic functions in glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we identify non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling and a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)/TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) autocrine/paracrine loop as critical mediators of BV6-stimulated migration and invasion of GBM cells. In addition to GBM cell lines, BV6 triggers cell elongation, migration and invasion in primary, patient-derived GBM cells at non-toxic concentrations, which do not affect cell viability or proliferation, and also increases infiltrative tumor growth in vivo underscoring the relevance of these findings. Molecular studies reveal that BV6 causes rapid degradation of cellular IAP proteins, accumulation of NIK, processing of p100 to p52, translocation of p52 into the nucleus, increased NF-κB DNA binding and enhanced NF-κB transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift shows that the NF-κB DNA-binding subunits consist of p50, p52 and RelB further confirming the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. BV6-stimulated NF-κB activation leads to elevated mRNA levels of TNFα and additional NF-κB target genes involved in migration (i.e., interleukin 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, CXC chemokine receptor 4) and invasion (i.e., matrix metalloproteinase-9). Importantly, inhibition of NF-κB by overexpression of dominant-negative IκBα superrepressor prevents the BV6-stimulated cell elongation, migration and invasion. Similarly, specific inhibition of non-canonical NF-κB signaling by RNA interference-mediated silencing of NIK suppresses the BV6-induced cell elongation, migration and invasion as well as upregulation of NF-κB target genes. Intriguingly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the BV6-stimulated TNFα autocrine/paracrine loop by the TNFα-blocking antibody Enbrel or by knockdown of TNFR1 abrogates BV6-induced cell elongation, migration and invasion. By demonstrating that the Smac mimetic BV6 at non-toxic concentrations promotes migration and invasion of GBM cells via non-canonical NF-κB signaling, our findings have important implications for the use of Smac mimetics as cancer therapeutic.
 novel pro-apoptotic gene, was activated during the early response to DNA damage. Previous studies have shown that hPNAS-4 can inhibit tumor growth when over-expressed in ovarian cancer cells. However, the underlying action mechanism remains elusive. In this work, we found that hPNAS-4 expression was significantly increased in SKOV3 cells when exposed to cisplatin, methyl methanesulfonate or mitomycin C, and that its overexpression could induce proliferation inhibition, S phase arrest and apoptosis in A2780s and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The S phase arrest caused by hPNAS-4 was associated with up-regulation of p21. p21 is p53-dispensable and correlates with activation of ERK, and activation of the Cdc25A-Cdk2-Cyclin E/Cyclin A pathway, while the pro-apoptotic effects of hPNAS-4 were mediated by activation of caspase-9 and -3 other than caspase-8, and accompanied by release of AIF, Smac and cytochrome c into the cytosol. Taken together, these data suggest a new mechanism by which hPNAS-4 inhibits proliferation of ovarian cancer cells by inducing S phase arrest and apoptosis via activation of Cdc25A-Cdk2-Cyclin E/Cyclin A axis and mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. To our knowledge, we provide the first molecular evidence for the potential application of hPNAS-4 as a novel target in ovarian cancer gene therap.
 brain injury (TBI) induces a complex sequence of apopototic cascades that contribute to secondary tissue damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salidroside, a phenolic glycoside with potent anti-apoptotic properties, on behavioral and histological outcomes, brain edema, and apoptosis following experimental TBI and the possible involvement of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathwa.
ected to controlled cortical impact injury received intraperitoneal salidroside (20, or 50 mg/kg) or vehicle injection 10 min after injury. Behavioral studies, histology analysis and brain water content assessment were performed. Levels of PI3K/Akt signaling-related molecules, apoptosis-related proteins, cytochrome C (CytoC), and Smac/DIABLO were also analyzed. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was administered to examine the mechanism of protection. The protective effect of salidroside was also investigated in primary cultured neurons subjected to stretch injury. Treatment with 20 mg/kg salidroside significantly improved functional recovery and reduced brain tissue damage up to post-injury day 28. Salidroside also significantly reduced neuronal death, apoptosis, and brain edema at day 1. These changes were associated with significant decreases in cleaved caspase-3, CytoC, and Smac/DIABLO at days 1 and 3. Salidroside increased phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 and the mitochondrial Bcl-2/Bax ratio at day 1, and enhanced phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 at day 3. This beneficial effect was abolished by pre-injection of LY294002. Moreover, delayed administration of salidroside at 3 or 6 h post-injury reduced neuronal damage at day 1. Salidroside treatment also decreased neuronal vulnerability to stretch-induced injury in vitr.
ry salidroside improved long-term behavioral and histological outcomes and reduced brain edema and apoptosis following TBI, at least partially via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathwa.
stoma is a malignant tumor of the retina usually occurring in young children. To date, the conventional treatments for retinoblastoma have been enucleation, cryotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. Most of these treatments, however, have possible side effects, including blindness, infections, fever, gastrointestinal toxicity, and neurotoxicity. More effective treatments are therefore imperative. Gossypol has been reported as a potential inhibitor of cell proliferation in various types of cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, and lung cancer. This study investigates the possible antiproliferative effect of gossypol on retinoblastom.
inoblastoma cells were cultured with various concentrations of gossypol and checked for cell viability with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Nuclear condensation caused by cell apoptosis was detected by staining retinoblastoma cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), counting those with condensed nuclei, and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells. In addition, the stages of apoptosis and phases in cell cycles were examined with flow cytometry. The possible signal transduction pathways involved were examined with a protein array assay and western blot analysi.
ubation, the cell survival rate was significantly lower after treatment with 5, 10, and 20 µM of gossypol. The maximum antisurvival effect of gossypol was observed at 20 µM, and the number of apoptotic cells was higher in the preparations cultured with 10 and 20 µM of gossypol. The results in flow cytometry indicated that at concentrations of 10 and 20 µM, gossypol increased the proportion of early- and late-apoptotic retinoblastoma cells and induced cell arrest of retinoblastoma cells at the same concentrations. This antiproliferative effect was later confirmed by upregulating the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5), caspase 8, caspase 9, caspase 3, cytochrome C, tumor protein 53 (p53), and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) in the signal transduction pathway.
ded that gossypol has an antiproliferative effect on retinoblastoma cell.
ntial responsiveness of patients to ionizing radiation is observed after preoperative radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma that might be related, in part, to an apoptosis defect. To establish if proteins of the apoptotic cascades [pro-apoptotic: active caspase 3, 8, and 9 and DIABLO (direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low pI); anti-apoptotic: XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis)] are involved, we analyzed their profile in radioresistant (SW480) and radiosensitive (SW48) human colorectal cell lines. We demonstrated that, after irradiation, the SW48 cells increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, whereas the SW480 cells increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP. Moreover, XIAP knockdown in SW480 cells enhanced the basal and radiation-induced apoptotic index; the propensity of the SW480 cells to undergo apoptosis after radiation was higher compared with SW48 cells. In a translational study of 38 patients with rectal carcinoma, we analyzed the apoptotic profile for tumor and noncancerous tissue for each biopsy specimen using IHC. According to their response to preoperative radiotherapy, patients were classified into two groups: responsive and nonresponsive. Although no difference in expression of caspase 3, 8, or 9 was observed in the tumor/normal tissue ratio between responsive and nonresponsive patients, the ratio decreased for DIABLO and increased for XIAP. In conclusion, inhibition of XIAP rescues cellular radiosensitivity and both DIABLO and XIAP might be potential predictive markers of radiation responsiveness in rectal adenocarcinom.
d mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac/DIABLO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and survivin are known to play a significant role in the growth and development of numerous tumors. Serum concentrations of VEGF, survivin, and Smac/DIABLO were analyzed in 92 patients with serous ovarian cancer and 94 healthy controls. Values were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes. The median pretreatment serum VEGF and survivin levels in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma were significantly higher, while Smac/DIABLO levels were significantly lower than that in healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the best cutoff point for VEGF was determined to be 345&nbsp;pg/ml; with 83&nbsp;% sensitivity and 65&nbsp;% specificity. For survivin, the cutoff point was 110&nbsp;pg/ml and for Smac/DIABLO was 75&nbsp;pg/ml, with 82 and 62&nbsp;% sensitivity and 43 and 87&nbsp;% specificity, respectively. In the patients group, higher VEGF and survivin levels and lower Smac/DIABLO levels in sera were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Preoperative measurement of serum VEGF, survivin, and Smac/DIABLO may be of help in early detection of serous ovarian cancer and may provide important information about the patient's outcome and prognosi.
 angiogenesis, one of the hallmarks of carcinogenesis, using non-toxic phytochemicals has emerged as a translational opportunity for angioprevention and to control advanced stages of malignancy. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory effects and associated mechanism/s of action of Procyanidin B2-3,3″-di- O-gallate (B2G2), a major component of grape seed extract, on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human prostate microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Our results showed that B2G2 (10-40 μM) inhibits growth and induces death in both HUVECs and HPMECs. Additional studies revealed that B2G2 causes a G1 arrest in cell cycle progression of HUVECs by down-regulating cyclins (D1 and A), CDKs (Cdk2 and Cdc2) and Cdc25c phosphatase and up-regulating CDK inhibitors (p21 and p27) expression. B2G2 also induced strong apoptotic death in HUVECs through increasing p53, Bax and Smac/Diablo expression while decreasing Bcl-2 and survivin levels. Additionally, B2G2 inhibited the growth factors-induced capillary tube formation in HUVECs and HPMECs. Interestingly, conditioned media (CCM) from prostate cancer (PCA) cells (LNCaP and PC3) grown under normoxic (~21% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions significantly enhanced the tube formation in HUVECs, which was compromised in presence of conditioned media from B2G2-treated PCA cells. B2G2 also inhibited the motility and invasiveness of both HUVECs and HPMECs. Mechanistic studies showed that B2G2 targets VEGFR2/PI3K/Akt and integrin signaling molecules which are important for endothelial cells survival, proliferation, tube formation and motility. Overall, we report that B2G2 inhibits several attributes of angiogenesis in cell culture; therefore, it warrants further investigation for efficacy for angioprevention and cancer contro.
itor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis pathways. The potential prognostic value of the expression of selected IAP family members, XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and survivin protein, was evaluated with regard to treatment response and survival of 56 newly diagnosed adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presence of these IAP members influenced the achievement of a complete response (CR). In addition, overall survival (OS) was influenced by low survivin expression in univariate and multivariate analysis (p = 0.014 and p = 0.013, respectively). A strong correlation was observed between members of the IAP family (XIAP and cIAP-1, XIAP and cIAP-2, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2, p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons), while Smac/DIABLO demonstrated an inverse correlation with XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). Further studies should be undertaken to better demonstrate the mode of action of IAP members, as well as their prognostic and therapeutic potential.
poptosis is a key factor in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO) is an antagonist of IAPs. Recently, Smac/DIABLO was identified as a potent therapeutic target. However, the clinical significance of Smac/DIABLO in gastrointestinal carcinomas remains unclear. In the present study, Smac/DIABLO expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 72 gastric adenocarcinomas and 78 colorectal adenocarcinomas. The expression of Smac/DIABLO was significantly higher in colorectal carcinoma than in gastric carcinoma. Additionally, a correlation was found between the expression of Smac/DIABLO and nuclear survivin in well- to moderately-differentiated colorectal adenocarcinomas (r=0.245; P&lt;0.01). Based on these results, it was hypothesized that gastric and colorectal carcinomas differ in the level of Smac/DIABLO expression. Our previous studies revealed that the expression of cleaved caspase-9 was significantly lower in colorectal carcinoma than in gastric carcinoma (P&lt;0.0001). Conversely, the expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), an autophagy marker, and survivin were significantly higher in colon cancer than in gastric cancer (P&lt;0.0001 and P&lt;0.01, respectively). Taken together, these results indicate that not only LC3 and survivin expression, but also Smac/DIABLO expression, are significantly higher in colorectal carcinoma than in gastric carcinoma. We hypothesize that the analysis of Smac/DIABLO, survivin and LC3 expression in colorectal carcinoma is likely to aid cancer therapy due to the involvement of these markers in apoptosis and/or autophag.
rosis factor α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent with cancer cell-selective cell death inducing effect. However, the major limitation in the usage of TRAIL as a chemotherapeutic agent is the development of TRAIL resistance in many cancer types including myeloid leukemia. In this study, we report for the first time that Medicarpin (Med), a naturally occurring phytoalexin sensitizes myeloid leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Combination of Med and TRAIL induced significantly higher apoptosis compared with that of the individual treatments of either agent alone through activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic cell death pathways characterized by the activation of caspases 8, 9, 3, and 7. Med treatment downregulated antiapoptotic proteins (Survivin, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, XIAP, and c-FLIP), upregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cytochrome C, Smac/Diablo, Bid, truncated Bid (tBid), p-eIF2α, Bip, and CHOP (CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein)), induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest, and increased the expression of the functional TRAIL receptor DR5 through activation of the ROS-JNK-CHOP pathway. Gain and loss of function studies clearly indicated that DR5 expression was critical for Med-induced TRAIL sensitization. The Med-induced TRAIL sensitization did not involve the NFkB signaling pathway or redistribution of DR5 in lipid rafts. The concomitant treatment with Med and TRAIL showed robust apoptotic effects in primary myeloid leukemia cells but had no toxic effects in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In conclusion, our results suggest that Med sensitizes myeloid leukemia cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the upregulation of DR5 through activation of the ROS-JNK-CHOP pathwa.
tance of cancerous cells to chemotherapy remains the main limitation for cancer treatment at present. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antitumor drug that activates the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but unfortunately it also activates the Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB) pathway leading to the promotion of tumor cell survival. MG132 is a drug that inhibits I kappa B degradation by the proteasome-avoiding activation of NF-кB. In this work, we studied the sensitizing effect of the MG132 proteasome inhibitor on the antitumor activity of DO.
n leukemia cells were treated with MG132, DOX, or both drugs. We evaluated proliferation, viability, apoptosis, caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity and cleavage, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane potential, the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic proteins, senescence, p65 phosphorylation, and pro- and antiapoptotic gene.
est apoptosis percentage in U937 cells was obtained with a combination of MG132 + DOX. Likewise, employing both drugs, we observed a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and important caspase-3 activation, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Therefore, MG132 decreases senescence, p65 phosphorylation, and the DOX-induced Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein. The MG132 + DOX treatment induced upregulation of proapoptotic genes BAX, DIABLO, NOXA, DR4, and FAS. It also induced downregulation of the antiapoptotic genes BCL-XL and SURVIVI.
sitizes U937 leukemia cells to DOX-induced apoptosis, increasing its anti-leukemic effectivenes.
-based chemotherapy is considered the gold standard for patients with advanced bladder cancer. However, despite initial response, many patients will relapse; therefore, novel salvage treatment strategies are desperately needed. Herein, we studied a mechanism based treatment combination using a Smac mimetic with standard chemotherapy. Using a panel of 10 urothelial cancer cell lines, we exposed them to a combination of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and a Smac mimetic. Sensitivity was determined using a DNA fragmentation assay. We determined that three cell lines (UMUC-3, UMUC-13, and RT4v6) were considered sensitive to the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin and an additional three cell lines were sensitized to gemcitabine and cisplatin with the addition of the Smac mimetic (UMUC-6, UMUC-12, and UMUC-18). We next explored the constitutive expression of selected members of the IAP family (XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, and Survivin), the BCL family (BCL-2, BCLXL, and BAX) and Smac using gene expression profiling and western blotting. We determined that RNA and protein expression of SMAC, selected members of the IAP family and members of the BCL family did not correlate to drug sensitivity. Lastly, using an in vivo mouse model, we determined that treatment with the Smac mimetic in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin resulted in increased apoptosis, decreased microvessel density and decreased cellular proliferation. This novel treatment strategy may be effective in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and warrants further investigatio.
enic transcription factors NF-κB and β-catenin, constitutively activated by upstream serine/threonine kinases control several cellular processes implicated in malignant transformation including apoptosis evasion. The aim of this study was to investigate the chemopreventive effects of astaxanthin, an antioxidant carotenoid, in the hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis model based on its ability to modulate NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways and induce apoptosi.
ined the effect of dietary supplementation of astaxanthin on the oncogenic signaling pathways - NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin, their upstream activator kinases - Erk/MAPK and PI-3K/Akt, and the downstream event - apoptosis evasion by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical analyse.
that astaxanthin inhibits NF-κB and Wnt signaling by downregulating the key regulatory enzymes IKKβ and GSK-3β. Analysis of gene expression and docking interactions revealed that inhibition of these pathways may be mediated via inactivation of the upstream signaling kinases Erk/Akt by astaxanthin. Astaxanthin also induced caspase-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis by downregulating the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2, p-Bad, and survivin and upregulating proapoptotic Bax and Bad, accompanied by efflux of Smac/Diablo and cytochrome-c into the cytosol, and induced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP.
ts provide compelling evidence that astaxanthin exerts chemopreventive effects by concurrently inhibiting phosphorylation of transcription factors and signaling kinases and inducing intrinsic apoptosi.
in targets key molecules in oncogenic signaling pathways and induces apoptosis and is a promising candidate agent for cancer prevention and therap.
gy, the resistance of the cancerous cells to chemotherapy continues to be the principal limitation. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor plays an important role in tumor escape and resistance to chemotherapy and this factor regulates several pathways that promote tumor survival including some antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. In this study, we investigated, in U937 human leukemia cells, the effects of PTX and the MG132 proteasome inhibitor, drugs that can disrupt the NF-κB pathway. For this, we evaluated viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, caspases-3, -8, -9, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, p65 phosphorylation, and the modification in the expression of pro- and antiapoptotic genes, and the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL antiapoptotic protein.
rugs affect the viability of the leukemia cells in a time-dependent manner. The greatest percentage of apoptosis was obtained with a combination of the drugs; likewise, PTX and MG132 induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest and cleavage of caspases -3,-8, -9 and cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane potential loss in U937 human leukemia cells. In these cells, PTX and the MG132 proteasome inhibitor decrease p65 (NF-κB subunit) phosphorylation and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. We also observed, with a combination of these drugs overexpression of a group of the proapoptotic genes BAX, DIABLO, and FAS while the genes BCL-XL, MCL-1, survivin, IκB, and P65 were downregulate.
rugs used induce apoptosis per se, this cytotoxicity was greater with combination of both drugs. These observations are related with the caspases -9, -3 cleavage and G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and a decrease in p65 phosphorylation and Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. As well as this combination of drugs promotes the upregulation of the proapoptotic genes and downregulation of antiapoptotic genes. These observations strongly confirm antileukemic potentia.
ty to modulate balance between cell survival and death is recognized for its great therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on elucidation of cell machinery and signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and apoptosis. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents often have a cytostatic effect over tumor cells. New natural or synthetic chemotherapeutic agents have a wider spectrum of interesting antitumor activities that merit in-depth studies. In the present work, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanism leading to induction of cell death upon treatment of the lymphoblastoid cell line PL104 with caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE), MG132 and two conventional chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicine (DOX) and vincristine (VCR). Our results showed several apoptotic hallmarks such as phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, nuclear fragmentation, and increase sub-G1 DNA content after all treatments. In addition, all four drugs downregulated survivin expression. CAPE and both chemotherapeutic agents reduced Bcl-2, while only CAPE and MG132 significantly increased Bax level. CAPE and VCR treatment induced the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm). All compounds induced cytochrome c release from mitochondrial compartment to cytosol. However, only MG132 caused the translocation of Smac/DIABLO. Except for VCR treatment, all other drugs increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production level. All treatments induced activation of caspases 3/7, but only CAPE and MG132 led to the activation of caspase 9. In conclusion, our results indicate that CAPE and MG132 treatment of PL104 cells induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway, whereas the apoptotic mechanism induced by DOX and VCR may proceed through the extrinsic pathwa.
unological screening of a mouse testicular cDNA library with a human CREST serum we isolated five overlapping cDNA clones encoding the mouse homolog of a Golgi coatomer complex protein (accession number AF043120), designated beta'-COP in bovine and p102 in humans. We generated antibodies against this protein which specifically recognize the Golgi apparatus of mouse spermatocytes. FISH analyses assigned the beta'-COP gene Copb2 to mouse Chromosome 9, region E3-F1. Our results demonstrate that CREST sera can contain antibody components against Golgi proteins as well as against nuclear protein.
fy host factors relevant for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library screen targeting the human kinome. Protein kinases are key regulators of many cellular functions, and the systematic knockdown of their expression should provide a broad perspective on factors and pathways promoting or antagonizing coronavirus replication. In addition to 40 proteins that promote SARS-CoV replication, our study identified 90 factors exhibiting an antiviral effect. Pathway analysis grouped subsets of these factors in specific cellular processes, including the innate immune response and the metabolism of complex lipids, which appear to play a role in SARS-CoV infection. Several factors were selected for in-depth validation in follow-up experiments. In cells depleted for the β2 subunit of the coatomer protein complex (COPB2), the strongest proviral hit, we observed reduced SARS-CoV protein expression and a &gt;2-log reduction in virus yield. Knockdown of the COPB2-related proteins COPB1 and Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) also suggested that COPI-coated vesicles and/or the early secretory pathway are important for SARS-CoV replication. Depletion of the antiviral double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) enhanced virus replication in the primary screen, and validation experiments confirmed increased SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production upon PKR depletion. In addition, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was identified as a novel antiviral host factor in SARS-CoV replication. The inventory of pro- and antiviral host factors and pathways described here substantiates and expands our understanding of SARS-CoV replication and may contribute to the identification of novel targets for antiviral therap.
on of all viruses, including SARS-CoV, depends on and is influenced by cellular pathways. Although substantial progress has been made in dissecting the coronavirus replicative cycle, our understanding of the host factors that stimulate (proviral factors) or restrict (antiviral factors) infection remains far from complete. To study the role of host proteins in SARS-CoV infection, we set out to systematically identify kinase-regulated processes that influence virus replication. Protein kinases are key regulators in signal transduction, controlling a wide variety of cellular processes, and many of them are targets of approved drugs and other compounds. Our screen identified a variety of hits and will form the basis for more detailed follow-up studies that should contribute to a better understanding of SARS-CoV replication and coronavirus-host interactions in general. The identified factors could be interesting targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapy to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruse.
umber of studies have investigated changes induced by morphine exposure in gene expression using several experimental models. In this study, we examined gene expression changes during chronic exposure to morphine during maturation and differentiation of zebrafish CN.
y analysis showed 254 genes whose expression was identified as different by at least 1.3 fold change following chronic morphine exposure as compared to controls. Of these, several novel genes (grb2, copb2, otpb, magi1b, grik-l, bnip4 and sox19b) have been detected for the first time in an experimental animal model treated with morphine. We have also identified a subset of genes (dao.1, wls, bnip4 and camk1γb) differentially expressed by chronic morphine exposure whose expression is related to mu opioid receptor gene expression. Altered expression of copb2, bnip4, sox19b, otpb, dao.1, grik-l and wls is indicative of modified neuronal development, CNS patterning processes, differentiation and dopaminergic neurotransmission, serotonergic signaling pathway, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The deregulation of camk1γb signaling genes suggests an activation of axonogenesis and dendritogenesi.
 identified different functional classes of genes and individual candidates involved in the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to morphine actions related to CNS development. These results open new lines to study the treatment of pain and the molecular mechanisms involved in addiction. We also found a set of zebrafish-specific morphine-induced genes, which may be putative targets in human models for addiction and pain processe.
c Gram-negative bacteria use type III secretion (T3S) to inject effector proteins into the host cell to create appropriate conditions for infection and intracellular replication. Chlamydia spp. are believed to use T3S to infect their host cell, and the translocator proteins are an essential component of this system. Chlamydia pneumoniae contains genes encoding two sets of translocator proteins; CopB and CopD, and CopB2 and CopD2. In this study, we identified novel interactions between CopD and three type III secretion proteins; namely, CopN, CdsN, and CdsF. We identified a CopD putative chaperone binding motif, PxLxxP, within the N-terminal region (CopD amino acids 120-125), which was necessary for interaction with its putative chaperone LcrH_1. Using size exclusion chromatography, we showed that CopD and LcrH_1 formed higher order structures in solution with CopD and LcrH_1 binding in a ratio of 1∶1, which is unique for T3SS translocator proteins. Lastly, we showed that antibodies to CopD reduced C. pneumoniae infectivity by &gt;95%. Collectively, this data suggests that CopD plays a critical role in pathogenesis and likely functions as a hydrophobic translocator of the type III secretion system in Chlamydia pneumonia.
e transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi is an essential part of the secretory pathway that all newly synthesised secreted and membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells undergo. The aim of this study was to characterise two components of the retrograde transport pathway in the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis (salmon louse) on a molecular and functional level. LsKDELR and LsCOPB2 were confirmed to be the salmon louse homologues of the chosen target proteins by sequence similarity. Ontogenetic analysis by qRT-PCR revealed the highest expression levels of both genes in adult females and the earliest larval stage. LsKDELR and LsCOPB2 localisation in adult females was detected by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridisation, respectively. Both LsKDELR and LsCOPB2 were found in the ovaries, the oocytes and the gut. LsKDELR and LsCOPB2 were knocked down by RNA interference in preadult females, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR. LsCOPB2 knockdown lice had a significantly higher mortality and failed to develop normally, while both LsCOPB2 and LsKDELR knockdown caused disturbed digestion and the absence of egg strings. This shows the potential of LsKDELR and LsCOPB2 as suitable target candidates for new pest control method.
fy genes that kill Tetranychus urticae when knocked down via RNA interference (RNAi), several lethal genes were screened by the systemic delivery of dsRNA via leaf disc feeding. Four candidate genes (β subunit of coatomer protein complex, T-COPB2; M1 metalloprotease, T-M1MP; Ribosomal protein S4, T-RPS4; A subunit of V-ATPase, T-VATPase) and a control gene (EGFP) were tested for RNAi. All dsRNAs that permeated the leaf disc (ca. 15-mm diameter) were detected at 12h post-treatment, indicating that dsRNA could move through vascular tissues. To evaluate RNAi toxicity, mortalities were assessed for 120h following treatment with dsRNA. Treatment with T-COPB2, T-M1MP, T-RPS4 and T-VATPase dsRNAs caused 65.4%, 15.9%, 36.1% and 21.1% mortalities at 120h post-treatment, respectively. Reduction of all target gene transcripts following dsRNA treatment was confirmed by quantitative PCR, demonstrating that dsRNA feeding-based RNAi could indeed kill T. urticae. In summary, dsRNA delivery via leaf disc is an effective system to screen for lethal genes. Furthermore, some genes, such as T-COPB2, T-M1MP, T-RPS4 and T-VATPase, can be used to establish an RNAi-based control system against T. urtica.
there have been numerous observations of vitamin D deficiency and its links to chronic diseases, no studies have reported on how vitamin D status and vitamin D3 supplementation affects broad gene expression in humans. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin D status and subsequent vitamin D supplementation on broad gene expression in healthy adults. (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01696409.
zed, double-blind, single center pilot trial was conducted for comparing vitamin D supplementation with either 400 IUs (n = 3) or 2000 IUs (n = 5) vitamin D3 daily for 2 months on broad gene expression in the white blood cells collected from 8 healthy adults in the winter. Microarrays of the 16 buffy coats from eight subjects passed the quality control filters and normalized with the RMA method. Vitamin D3 supplementation that improved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was associated with at least a 1.5 fold alteration in the expression of 291 genes. There was a significant difference in the expression of 66 genes between subjects at baseline with vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D&lt;20 ng/ml) and subjects with a 25(OH)D&gt;20 ng/ml. After vitamin D3 supplementation gene expression of these 66 genes was similar for both groups. Seventeen vitamin D-regulated genes with new candidate vitamin D response elements including TRIM27, CD83, COPB2, YRNA and CETN3 which have been shown to be important for transcriptional regulation, immune function, response to stress and DNA repair were identifie.
suggest that any improvement in vitamin D status will significantly affect expression of genes that have a wide variety of biologic functions of more than 160 pathways linked to cancer, autoimmune disorders and cardiovascular disease with have been associated with vitamin D deficiency. This study reveals for the first time molecular finger prints that help explain the nonskeletal health benefits of vitamin .

 spp. are among the many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria that employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to overcome host defenses and exploit available resources. Significant progress has been made in elucidating contributions of T3S to the pathogenesis of these medically important, obligate intracellular parasites, yet important questions remain. Chief among these is how secreted effector proteins traverse eukaryotic membranes to gain access to the host cytosol. Due to a complex developmental cycle, it is possible that chlamydiae utilize a different complement of proteins to accomplish translocation at different stages of development. We investigated this possibility by extending the characterization of C. trachomatis CopB and CopB2. CopB is detected early during infection but is depleted and not detected again until about 20 h postinfection. In contrast, CopB2 was detectible throughout development. CopB is associated with the inclusion membrane. Biochemical and ectopic expression analyses were consistent with peripheral association of CopB2 with inclusion membranes. This interaction correlated with development and required both chlamydial de novo protein synthesis and T3SS activity. Collectively, our data indicate that it is unlikely that CopB serves as the sole chlamydial translocation pore and that CopB2 is capable of association with the inclusion membran.
disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome that primarily affects infants and young children. Its etiology is unknown; however, epidemiological findings suggest that genetic predisposition underlies disease susceptibility. Taiwan has the third-highest incidence of KD in the world, after Japan and Korea. To investigate novel mechanisms that might predispose individuals to KD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 250 KD patients and 446 controls in a Han Chinese population residing in Taiwan, and further validated our findings in an independent Han Chinese cohort of 208 cases and 366 controls. The most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in the joint analysis corresponded to three novel loci. Among these KD-associated SNPs three were close to the COPB2 (coatomer protein complex beta-2 subunit) gene: rs1873668 (p = 9.52×10⁻⁵), rs4243399 (p = 9.93×10⁻⁵), and rs16849083 (p = 9.93×10⁻⁵). We also identified a SNP in the intronic region of the ERAP1 (endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidase 1) gene (rs149481, p(best) = 4.61×10⁻⁵). Six SNPs (rs17113284, rs8005468, rs10129255, rs2007467, rs10150241, and rs12590667) clustered in an area containing immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions genes, with p(best)-values between 2.08×10⁻⁵ and 8.93×10⁻⁶, were also identified. This is the first KD GWAS performed in a Han Chinese population. The novel KD candidates we identified have been implicated in T cell receptor signaling, regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as antibody-mediated immune responses. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis of K.
l RNAi-based data for target gene identification are strongly dependent on the use of a biologically relevant cell type and efficient delivery of highly functional siRNA reagents into the selected cell type. Here we report the use of the Amaxa(R) Nucleofector(R) 96-well Shuttle(R) System for siRNA screening in primary cells. Lonza's Clonetics(R) HUVEC-Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells were transfected with Thermo Scientific Dharmacon siGENOME(R) siRNA Libraries targeting protein kinases and cell cycle related genes and screened for genes important for cell viability. Of the 37 primary hits, down-regulation of 33 led to reduced proliferation or increased cell death, while down-regulation of two allowed for better cell viability. The validated four genes out of the 16 strongest primary hits (COPB2, PYCS, CDK4 and MYC) influenced cell proliferation to varying degrees, reflecting differing importance for survival of HUVEC cells. Our results demonstrate that the Nucleofector(R) 96-well Shuttle(R) System allows the delivery of siRNA libraries in cell types previously considered to be difficult to transfect. Thus, identification and validation of gene targets can now be conducted in primary cells, as the selection of cell types is not limited to those accessible by lipid-mediated transfectio.
 mesothelioma is a highly aggressive tumor arising from serosal surfaces of the pleura and is triggered by past exposure to asbestos. Currently, there is no widely accepted treatment for mesothelioma. Development of effective drug treatments for human cancers requires identification of therapeutic molecular targets. We therefore conducted a large-scale functional screening of mesothelioma cells using a genome-wide small interfering RNA library. We determined that knockdown of 39 genes suppressed mesothelioma cell proliferation. At least seven of the 39 genes-COPA, COPB2, EIF3D, POLR2A, PSMA6, RBM8A, and RPL18A-would be involved in anti-apoptotic function. In particular, the COPA protein was highly expressed in some mesothelioma cell lines but not in a pleural mesothelial cell line. COPA knockdown induced apoptosis and suppressed tumor growth in a mesothelioma mouse model. Therefore, COPA may have the potential of a therapeutic target and a new diagnostic marker of mesotheliom.
protein kinase Ciota (PKCiota) is an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we identify four functional gene targets of PKCiota in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), the most prominent form of NSCL.
ependent public domain gene expression data sets were interrogated to identify genes coordinately expressed with PKCiota in primary LAC tumors. Results were validated by QPCR in an independent set of primary LAC tumors. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKCiota and the target genes was used to determine whether expression of the identified genes was regulated by PKCiota, and whether these target genes play a role in anchorage-independent growth and invasion of LAC cell.
ysis identified seven genes whose expression correlated with PKCiota in primary LAC. Subsequent QPCR analysis confirmed coordinate overexpression of four genes (COPB2, ELF3, RFC4, and PLS1) in an independent set of LAC samples. RNAi-mediated knockdown showed that PKCiota regulates expression of all four genes in LAC cells, and that the four PKCiota target genes play an important role in the anchorage-independent growth and invasion of LAC cells. Meta-analysis of gene expression data sets from lung squamous cell, breast, colon, prostate, and pancreas carcinomas, as well as glioblastoma, revealed that a subset of PKCiota target genes, particularly COPB2 and RFC4, correlate with PKCiota expression in many tumor type.
ysis of public gene expression data are useful in identifying novel gene targets of oncogenic PKCiota signaling. Our data indicate that both common and cell type-specific signaling mechanisms contribute to PKCiota-dependent transformatio.
p and apply a model for prioritization of candidate glaucoma gene.
metrix GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif) study of gene expression in primary culture human trabecular meshwork cells uses a positional differential expression profile model for prioritization of candidate genes within the GLC1C genetic inclusion interva.
enes were expressed under all conditions within the GLC1C interval. TMEM22 was the only gene within the interval with differential expression in the same direction under both conditions tested. Two genes, ATP1B3 and COPB2, are of interest in the context of a protein-misfolding model for candidate selection. SLC25A36, PCCB, and FNDC6 are of lesser interest because of moderate expression and changes in expression. Transcription factor ZBTB38 emerges as an interesting candidate gene because of the overall expression level, differential expression, and functio.
ne in the GLC1C interval fits our model for differential expression under multiple glaucoma risk conditions. The use of multiple prioritization models resulted in filtering 7 candidate genes of higher interest out of the 41 known genes in the regio.
y identified a small subset of genes that are most likely to harbor mutations that cause glaucoma linked to GLC1.
ate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis expresses a type III secretion system (T3SS) which has the potential to contribute significantly to pathogenesis. Based on a demonstrated role of type III secretion (T3S)-specific chaperones in the secretion of antihost proteins by gram-negative pathogens, we initiated a study of selected putative Chlamydia T3S chaperones in an effort to gain mechanistic insight into the Chlamydia T3SS and to potentially identify Chlamydia-specific secreted products. C. trachomatis Scc2 and Scc3 are homologous to SycD of Yersinia spp. Functional studies of the heterologous Yersinia T3SS indicated that although neither Scc2 nor Scc3 was able to fully complement a sycD null mutant, both have SycD-like characteristics. Both were able to associate with the translocator protein YopD, and Scc3 expression restored limited secretion of YopD in in vitro studies of T3S. CopB (CT578) and CopB2 (CT861) are encoded adjacent to scc2 and scc3, respectively, and have structural similarities with the YopB family of T3S translocators. Either Scc2 or Scc3 coprecipitates with CopB from C. trachomatis extracts. Expression of CopB or CopB2 in Yersinia resulted in their type III-dependent secretion, and localization studies with C. trachomatis-infected cells indicated that both were secreted by Chlamydi.
cation breakpoint 171 kb 5' of the transcription start of FOXL2 causes blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and associated premature ovarian failure. The breakpoint falls within another gene, MRPS22, that has been sequenced in 500 kb of continuous DNA. MRPS22 encodes 20 exons and a number of alternative transcripts. Three CpG islands (&gt;91% identical) are followed by noncoding exons 4-12 and coding exons 13-20. The 3'UTR extends into the 3'UTR of COPB2. Based on the sequence, three reported translocations that cause BPES all fall within intron 6 of MRPS22. Comparisons reveal conserved segments in introns 6, 11, and 12 of human and mouse. Notably intron 11 sequence is also deleted in goat PIS syndrome (which combines craniofacial defects, female infertility, and XX sex reversal). The conserved sequences are candidates for models in which they are distant enhancers or otherwise affect higher order chromatin structure to impose long-range cis regulation of FOXL2 expressio.
yanidins (PAs) play an important role in plant disease defense and have beneficial effects on human health. We isolated and characterized a novel R2R3 MYB-type PA-regulator SsMYB3 from a well-known ornamental plant, coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides), to study the molecular regulation of PAs and to engineer PAs biosynthesis. The expression level of SsMYB3 was correlated with condensed tannins contents in various coleus tissues and was induced by wounding and light. A complementation test in the Arabidopsis tt2 mutant showed that SsMYB3 could restore the PA-deficient seed coat phenotype and activated expression of the PA-specific gene ANR and two related genes, DFR and ANS. In yeast two-hybrid assays, SsMYB3 interacted with the Arabidopsis AtTT8 and AtTTG1 to reform the ternary transcriptional complex, and also interacted with two tobacco bHLH proteins (NtAn1a and NtJAF13-1) and a WD40 protein, NtAn11-1. Ectopic overexpression of SsMYB3 in transgenic tobacco led to almost-white flowers by greatly reducing anthocyanin levels and enhancing accumulation of condensed tannins. This overexpression of SsMYB3 upregulated the key PA genes (NtLAR and NtANR) and late anthocyanin structural genes (NtDFR and NtANS), but downregulated the expression of the final anthocyanin gene NtUFGT. The formative SsMYB3-complex represses anthocyanin accumulation by directly suppressing the expression of the final anthocyanin structural gene NtUFGT, through competitive inhibition or destabilization of the endogenous NtAn2-complex formation. These results suggested that SsMYB3 may form a transcription activation complex to regulate PA biosynthesis in the Arabidopsis tt2 mutant and transgenic tobacco. Our findings suggest that SsMYB3 is involved in the regulation of PA biosynthesis in coleus and has the potential as a molecular tool for manipulating biosynthesis of PAs in fruits and other crops using metabolic engineerin.
e changes, there is a need to understand the expected effects on viticulture. In nature, stresses exist in a combined manner, hampering the elucidation of the effect of individual cues on grape berry metabolism. Cell suspension culture originated from pea-size Gamy Red grape berry was used to harness metabolic response to high light (HL; 2500 μmol m(-2)s(-1)), high temperature (HT; 40°C) and their combination in comparison to 25°C and 100 μmol m(-2)s(-1) under controlled condition. When LC-MS and GC-MS based metabolite profiling was implemented and integrated with targeted RT-qPCR transcript analysis specific responses were observed to the different cues. HL enhanced polyphenol metabolism while HT and its combination with HL induced amino acid and organic acid metabolism with additional effect on polyphenols. The trend of increment in TCA cycle genes like ATCs, ACo1, and IDH in the combined treatment might support the observed increment in organic acids, GABA shunt, and their derivatives. The apparent phenylalanine reduction with polyphenol increment under HL suggests enhanced fueling of the precursor toward the downstream phenylpropanoid pathway. In the polyphenol metabolism, a differential pattern of expression of flavonoid 3',5' hydroxylase and flavonoid 3' hydroxylase was observed under high light (HL) and combined cues which were accompanied by characteristic metabolite profiles. HT decreased glycosylated cyanidin and peonidin forms while the combined cues increased acetylated and coumarylated peonidin forms. Transcription factors regulating anthocyanin metabolism and their methylation, MYB, OMT, UFGT, and DFR, were expressed differentially among the treatments, overall in agreement with the metabolite profiles. Taken together these data provide insights into the coordination of central and secondary metabolism in relation to multiple abiotic stresse.
ve oxidase (AOX) is a diiron carboxylate protein present in all plants examined to date that couples the oxidation of ubiquinol with the reduction of oxygen to water. The predominant structure of AOX genes is four exons interrupted by three introns. In this study, by analyzing the genomic sequences of genes from different plant species, we deduced that intron/exon loss/gain and deletion of fragments are the major mechanisms responsible for the generation and evolution of AOX paralogous genes. Integrating gene duplication and structural information with expression profiles for various AOXs revealed that tandem duplication/block duplication contributed greatly to the generation and maintenance of the AOX gene family. Notably, the expression profiles based on public microarray database showed highly diverse expression patterns among AOX members in different developmental stages and tissues and that both orthologous and paralogous genes did not have the same expression profiles due to their divergence in regulatory regions. Comparative analysis of genes in six plant species under various perturbations indicated a large number of protein kinases, transcription factors and antioxidant enzymes are co-expressed with AOX. Of these, four sets of transcription factors-WRKY, NAC, bZIP and MYB-are likely involved in the regulating the differential responses of AOX1 genes to specific stresses. Furthermore, divergence of AOX1 and AOX2 subfamilies in regulation might be the main reason for their differential stress response.
 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), a member of cytochrome P450 protein family, introduces B-ring hydroxyl group in the 3' position of the flavonoid. In this study, the cDNA sequence of a F3'H gene (VviF3'H), which contains an open reading frame of 1530&nbsp;bp encoding a polypeptide of 509 amino acids, was cloned and characterized from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon. VviF3'H showed high homology to known F3'H genes, especially F3'Hs from the V.&nbsp;vinifera reference genome (Pinot Noir) and lotus. Expression profiling analysis using real-time PCR revealed that VviF3'H was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues including berries, leaves, flowers, roots, stems and tendrils, suggesting its important physiological role in plant growth and development. Moreover, the transcript level of VviF3'H gene in grape berries was relatively higher at early developmental stages and gradually decreased during véraison, and then increased in the mature phase. In addition, the promoter of VviF3'H was isolated by using TAIL-PCR. Yeast one-hybrid screening of the Cabernet Sauvignon cDNA library and subsequent in&nbsp;vivo/vitro validations revealed the interaction between VviF3'H promoter and several transcription factors, including members of HD-Zip, NAC, MYB and EIN families. A transcriptional regulation mechanism of VviF3'H expression is proposed for the first tim.
 response factor (ARF) genes encode a large family of proteins involving in auxin signaling transduction. SlARF3, a member of ARF gene, encoded a protein containing two conserved domains B3 and ARF and lacking an Aux/IAA domain. Expression analysis showed that SlARF3 has especially high expression level in trichomes. In situ hybridization also detected the SlARF3 transcripts in epidermal pavement cells of leaves. The physiological function of SlARF3 was studied by using RNA interference (RNAi) strategy. The SlARF3 down-regulated plants exhibited the decreased density of epidermal pavement cells and obviously reduced density of type I, V and VI trichomes of leaves, which indicates the important role of SlARF3 in the formation of trichome and epidermal cell in tomato. The number of shoot xylem cells was also decreased in SlARF3 down-regulated lines. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis identified 51 differential expression genes (DEGs) belonging to 14 TF families, such as MYB, bHLH, WD40 and C2H2 zinc finger. 27 DEGs were involved in the metabolism and signaling transduction of phytohormones, such as auxin, ethylene and gibberellin. These results indicated the important roles of the TFs and hormones in auxin dependent transcriptional regulation of trichome formation in tomato. Taken together, our results demonstrate the SlARF3 play important role in the formation of epidermal cells and trichomes and reveal novel and specific functions for ARFs in tomato developmental processe.
ding molecular mechanisms underlying plant salinity tolerance provides valuable knowledgebase for effective crop improvement through genetic engineering. Current proteomic technologies, which support reliable and high-throughput analyses, have been broadly used for exploring sophisticated molecular networks in plants. In the current study, we compared phosphoproteomic and proteomic changes in roots of different soybean seedlings of a salt-tolerant cultivar (Wenfeng07) and a salt-sensitive cultivar (Union85140) induced by salt stress. The root samples of Wenfeng07 and Union85140 at three-trifoliate stage were collected at 0 hr, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 4 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 48 hrs after been treated with 150 mM NaCl. LC-MS/MS based phosphoproteomic analysis of these samples identified a total of 2692 phosphoproteins and 5509 phosphorylation sites. Of these, 2344 phosphoproteins containing 3744 phosphorylation sites were quantitatively analyzed. Our results showed that 1163 phosphorylation sites were differentially phosphorylated in the two compared cultivars. Among them, 10 MYB/MYB transcription factor like proteins were identified with fluctuating phosphorylation modifications at different time points, indicating that their crucial roles in regulating flavonol accumulation might be mediated by phosphorylated modifications. In addition, the protein expression profiles of these two cultivars were compared using LC MS/MS based shotgun proteomic analysis, and expression pattern of all the 89 differentially expressed proteins were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the enzymes involved in chalcone metabolic pathway exhibited positive correlations with salt tolerance. We confirmed the functional relevance of chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CPM) genes using soybean composites and Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, and found that their salt tolerance were positively regulated by CHS, but was negatively regulated by CHI and CPM. A novel salt tolerance pathway involving chalcone metabolism, mostly mediated by phosphorylated MYB transcription factors, was proposed based on our findings. (The mass spectrometry raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002856.
in (GA) is a key signal molecule inducing differentiation of tracheary elements, fibers, and xylogenesis. However the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of GA on xylem elongation and secondary wall development in tree species remain to be determined. In this study, Betula platyphylla (birch) seeds were treated with 300 ppm GA₃ and/or 300 ppm paclobutrazol (PAC), seed germination was recorded, and transverse sections of hypocotyls were stained with toluidine blue; the two-month-old seedlings were treated with 50 μM GA₃ and/or 50 μM PAC, transverse sections of seedling stems were stained using phloroglucinol-HCl, and secondary wall biosynthesis related genes expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Results indicated that germination percentage, energy and time of seeds, hypocotyl height and seedling fresh weight were enhanced by GA₃, and reduced by PAC; the xylem development was wider in GA₃-treated plants than in the control; the expression of NAC and MYB transcription factors, CESA, PAL, and GA oxidase was up-regulated during GA₃ treatment, suggesting their role in GA₃-induced xylem development in the birch. Our results suggest that GA₃ induces the expression of secondary wall biosynthesis related genes to trigger xylogenesis in the birch plant.
torial approach of candidate gene-based association analysis and genome-wide association study (GWAS) integrated with QTL mapping, differential gene expression profiling and molecular haplotyping was deployed in the present study for quantitative dissection of complex flowering time trait in chickpea. Candidate gene-based association mapping in a flowering time association panel (92 diverse desi and kabuli accessions) was performed by employing the genotyping information of 5724 SNPs discovered from 82 known flowering chickpea gene orthologs of Arabidopsis and legumes as well as 832 gene-encoding transcripts that are differentially expressed during flower development in chickpea. GWAS using both genome-wide GBS- and candidate gene-based genotyping data of 30,129 SNPs in a structured population of 92 sequenced accessions (with 200-250&nbsp;kb LD decay) detected eight maximum effect genomic SNP loci (genes) associated (34&nbsp;% combined PVE) with flowering time. Six flowering time-associated major genomic loci harbouring five robust QTLs mapped on a high-resolution intra-specific genetic linkage map were validated (11.6-27.3&nbsp;% PVE at 5.4-11.7 LOD) further by traditional QTL mapping. The flower-specific expression, including differential up- and down-regulation (&gt;three folds) of eight flowering time-associated genes (including six genes validated by QTL mapping) especially in early flowering than late flowering contrasting chickpea accessions/mapping individuals during flower development was evident. The gene haplotype-based LD mapping discovered diverse novel natural allelic variants and haplotypes in eight genes with high trait association potential (41&nbsp;% combined PVE) for flowering time differentiation in cultivated and wild chickpea. Taken together, eight potential known/candidate flowering time-regulating genes [efl1 (early flowering 1), FLD (Flowering locus D), GI (GIGANTEA), Myb (Myeloblastosis), SFH3 (SEC14-like 3), bZIP (basic-leucine zipper), bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) and SBP (SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein)], including novel markers, QTLs, alleles and haplotypes delineated by aforesaid genome-wide integrated approach have potential for marker-assisted genetic improvement and unravelling the domestication pattern of flowering time in chickpe.
LIPS (FLP) and MYB88 transcription factors, which are closely related in structure and function, control the development of stomata, as well as entry into megasporogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, other locations where these transcription factors are expressed are poorly described. Documenting additional locations where these genes are expressed might define new functions for these gene.
n patterns were examined throughout vegetative and reproductive development. The expression from two transcriptional-reporter fusions were visualized with either β-glucuronidase (GUS) or green fluorescence protein (GFP.
and myb88 genes were expressed in many, previously unreported locations, consistent with the possibility of additional functions for FLP and MYB88. Moreover, expression domains especially of FLP display sharp cutoffs or boundarie.
on to stomatal and reproductive development, FLP and MYB88, which are R2R3 MYB transcription factor genes, are expressed in many locations in cells, tissues, and organ.
medii (Epimedium), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used as a kidney tonic and antirheumatic medicine for thousands of years. In Epimedium, flavonoids have been demonstrated to be the main bioactive components (BCs). However, the molecular biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms of flavonoid-derived BCs remain obscure. In this study, we isolated 12 structural genes and two putative transcription factors (TFs) in the flavonoid pathway. Phytochemical analysis showed that the total content of four representative BCs (epimedin A, B, C, and icariin) decreased slightly or dramatically in two lines of Epimedium sagittatum during leaf development. Transcriptional analysis revealed that two R2R3-MYB TFs (EsMYBA1 and EsMYBF1), together with a bHLH TF (EsGL3) and WD40 protein (EsTTG1), were supposed to coordinately regulate the anthocyanin and flavonol-derived BCs biosynthesis in leaves. Overexpression of EsFLS (flavonol synthase) in tobacco resulted in increased flavonols content and decreased anthocyanins content in flowers. Moreover, EsMYB12 negatively correlated with the accumulation of the four BCs, and might act as a transcriptional repressor in the flavonoid pathway. Therefore, the anthocyanin pathway may coordinate with the flavonol-derived BCs pathway in Epimedium leaves. A better understanding of the flavonoid biosynthetic and regulatory mechanisms in E. sagittatum will facilitate functional characterization, metabolic engineering, and molecular breeding studies of Epimedium specie.
s are secondary metabolites that play important roles in plant physiology. Despite numerous studies examined the effects of available carbon (C) or nitrogen (N) on flavonoid biosynthesis, the mechanism of C/N interactive effects on flavonoid metabolism is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the composition of flavonoids and the expression levels of flavonoid-related genes in leaves and calli of crabapple (Malus sp.) cultivars with different leaf colors grown on media with different C/N ratios. Our results show that high C/N ratios induce anthocyanin pigmentation in leaves of the ever-red cultivar 'Royalty' and the spring-red cultivar 'Prairifire,' as well as in three types of calli derived from the ever-green cultivar 'Spring Snow,' but not in the leaves of the ever-green cultivar 'Flame.' This phenomenon therefore correlated with anthocyanin content in these different samples. In addition, high C/N ratios in the growth media resulted in an increase in the concentration of flavones and flavonols in the leaves of the three crabapple cultivars. The transcript levels of the general flavonoid pathway genes [from chalcone synthase (CHS) to uridine diphosphat-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT) and flavonol synthase (FLS)] increased in response to high C/N ratios, and this in turn was correlated with the concentration of anthocyanins, flavones and flavonols in the leaves and calli. Expression of the late flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), UFGT and FLS in particular, was more strongly influenced by C/N ratios than other structural genes, and the increased expression of the structural genes under high C/N ratios coincided with a coordinated increase in transcript levels of a MYB transcription factor, MYB10. These results are likely to be useful for future generation of plants with an optimized flavonoid/anthocyanin content or desirable organ coloratio.
in is a protein binding domain that can interact each other or with other domains. In this study, 323 BESS domain containing (BESS-DC) proteins were identified in 3328 proteomes. These BESS-DC genes pertain to 41 species of five phyla, most of which are arthropod insects. A BESS domain contains two α-helixes linked by a coil or β-turn. Phylogenetic tree and architecture analysis show that the BESS domain seems to generate along with the DNA-binding MADF domain. Two hundred thirty three BESS-DC genes (71.1%) contain at least one MADF domain, while 59 genes (18.2%) had only the BESS domain. In addition to BESS and MADF domains, some of genes also contain other ligand binding domains, such as DAO, DUS and NAD_C. Nineteen genes (5.8%) are associated with other DNA binding domains, such as Myb and BED. The BESS-DC genes can be divided into 17 subfamilies, eight of which have more than one clade. In Bombyx mori, 12 BESS-DC genes that do not contain intron in the BESS domain region were localized to eight chromosomes. Real-time PCR results showed that most of the B. mori BESS-DC genes highly expressed from late larval stage to adult stage. The results of sequence comparison and evolution analyses suggest a hypothesis that the BESS-DC genes may play a role in central nervous system development, long term memory and metamorphosis of insects of different phyl.
 suppressor p53 functions predominantly as a transcription factor by activating and downregulating gene expression, leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. p53 was shown to indirectly repress transcription of the CCNB2, KIF23 and PLK4 cell cycle genes through the recently discovered p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway. However, it remained unclear whether this pathway is commonly used. Here, we identify genes regulated by p53 through this pathway in a genome-wide computational approach. The bioinformatic analysis is based on genome-wide DREAM complex binding data, p53-depedent mRNA expression data and a genome-wide definition of phylogenetically conserved CHR promoter elements. We find 210 target genes that are expected to be regulated by the p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway. The target gene list was verified by detailed analysis of p53-dependent repression of the cell cycle genes B-MYB (MYBL2), BUB1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CHEK2, MELK, POLD1, RAD18 and RAD54L. Most of the 210 target genes are essential regulators of G2 phase and mitosis. Thus, downregulation of these genes through the p53-p21-DREAM-CDE/CHR pathway appears to be a principal mechanism for G2/M cell cycle arrest by p5.
tional regulation is one of the major regulations in plant adventious shoot regeneration, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. In our study, the RNA-seq technology based on the IlluminaHiSeq 2000 sequencing platform was used to identify differentially expressed transcription factor (TF) encoding genes during callus formation stage and adventious shoot regeneration stage between wild type and adventious shoot formation defective mutant be1-3 and during the transition from dedifferentiation to redifferentiation stage in wildtype WS. Results show that 155 TFs were differentially expressed between be1-3 mutant and wild type during callus formation, of which 97 genes were up-regulated, and 58 genes were down-regulated; and that 68 genes were differentially expressed during redifferentiation stage, with 40 genes up-regulated and 28 genes down-regulated; whereas at the transition stage from dedifferentiation to redifferention in WS wild type explants, a total of 231 differentially expressed TF genes were identified, including 160 up-regualted genes and 71 down-regulated genes. Among these TF genes, the adventious shoot related transcription factor 1 (ART1) gene encoding a MYB-related (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) TF, was up-regulated 3 217 folds, and was the highest up-regulated gene during be1-3 callus formation. Over expression of the ART1 gene caused defects in callus formation and shoot regeneration and inhibited seedling growth, indicating that the ART1 gene is a negative regulator of callus formation and shoot regeneration. This work not only enriches our knowledge about the transcriptional regulation mechanism of adventious shoot regeneration, but also provides valuable information on candidate TF genes associated with adventious shoot regeneration for future researc.
alexin camalexin and indolic glucosinolates share not only a common evolutionary origin and a tightly interconnected biosynthetic pathway, but regulatory proteins controlling the shared enzymatic steps are also modulated by the same R2R3-MYB transcription factors. The indolic phytoalexin camalexin is a crucial defense metabolite in the model plant Arabidopsis. Indolic phytoalexins and glucosinolates appear to have a common evolutionary origin and are interconnected on the biosynthetic level: a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of camalexin, indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx), is also required for the biosynthesis of indolic glucosinolates and is under tight control by the transcription factors MYB34, MYB51, and MYB122. The abundance of camalexin was strongly reduced in myb34/51 and myb51/122 double and in triple myb mutant, suggesting that these transcription factors are important in camalexin biosynthesis. Furthermore, expression of MYB51 and MYB122 was significantly increased by biotic and abiotic camalexin-inducing agents. Feeding of the triple myb34/51/122 mutant with IAOx or indole-3-acetonitrile largely restored camalexin biosynthesis. Conversely, tryptophan could not complement the low camalexin phenotype of this mutant, which supports a role for the three MYB factors in camalexin biosynthesis upstream of IAOx. Consistently expression of the camalexin biosynthesis genes CYP71B15/PAD3 and CYP71A13 was not negatively affected in the triple myb mutant and the MYBs could not activate pCYP71B15::uidA expression in trans-activation assays with cultured Arabidopsis cells. In conclusion, this study reveals the importance of MYB factors regulating the generation of IAOx as precursor of camalexi.
cription factors (TFs) are important regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants. Here, we report MYB112 as a formerly unknown regulator of anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression profiling after chemically induced overexpression of MYB112 identified 28 up- and 28 down-regulated genes 5 hours after inducer treatment, including MYB7 and MYB32, which are both induced. In addition, upon extended induction, MYB112 also positively affects the expression of PAP1, a key TF of anthocyanin biosynthesis, but acts negatively towards MYB12 and MYB111, which both control flavonol biosynthesis. MYB112 binds to an 8-bp DNA fragment containing the core sequence (A/T/G)(A/C)CC(A/T)(A/G/T)(A/C)(T/C). By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) we demonstrate that MYB112 binds in vitro and in vivo to MYB7 and MYB32 promoters revealing them as direct downstream target genes. We further show that MYB112 expression is upregulated by salinity and high light stress, environmental parameters that both require the MYB112 transcription factor for anthocyanin accumulation under these stresses. In contrast to several other MYB transcription factors affecting anthocyanin biosynthesis, MYB112 expression is not controlled by nitrogen limitation or an excess of carbon. Thus, MYB112 constitutes a regulator that promotes anthocyanin accumulation under abiotic stress condition.
ds are yellow, orange, and red pigments that contribute to the beautiful colors and nutritive value of many flowers and fruits. The structural genes in the highly conserved carotenoid biosynthetic pathway have been well characterized in multiple plant systems, but little is known about the transcription factors that control the expression of these structural genes. By analyzing a chemically induced mutant of Mimulus lewisii through bulk segregant analysis and transgenic experiments, we have identified an R2R3-MYB, Reduced Carotenoid Pigmentation 1 (RCP1), as the first transcription factor that positively regulates carotenoid biosynthesis during flower development. Loss-of-function mutations in RCP1 lead to down-regulation of all carotenoid biosynthetic genes and reduced carotenoid content in M.&nbsp;lewisii flowers, a phenotype recapitulated by RNA interference in the wild-type background. Overexpression of this gene in the rcp1 mutant background restores carotenoid production and, unexpectedly, results in simultaneous decrease of anthocyanin production in some transgenic lines by down-regulating the expression of an activator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Identification of transcriptional regulators of carotenoid biosynthesis provides the 'toolbox' genes for understanding the molecular basis of flower color diversification in nature and for potential enhancement of carotenoid production in crop plants via genetic engineerin.
antioxidant status and positive abiotic stress response in dehydration enhance cell resistance to cryoinjury, and controlling oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species homeostasis maintenance leads to high survival. Cryoprotectants are important for cell survival in cryopreservation, but high concentrations can also cause oxidative stress. Adding vitamin C to the cryoprotectant doubled the survival ratio in Arabidopsis thaliana 60-h seedlings (seedlings after 60-h germination) cryopreservation. In this study, the metabolites and transcriptional profiling of 60-h seedlings were analyzed in both the control cryopreservation procedure (CCP) and an improved cryopreservation procedure (ICP) to reveal the mechanism of plant cell response to oxidative stress from cryopreservation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidation levels reached a peak after rapid cooling-warming in CCP, which were higher than that in ICP. In addition, gene regulation was significantly increased in CCP and decreased in ICP during rapid cooling-warming. Before cryogenic treatment, the number of specifically regulated genes was nearly 10 times higher in ICP dehydration than CCP dehydration. Among these genes, DREBs/CBFs were beneficial to cope with cryoinjury, and calcium-binding protein, OXI1, WRKY and MYB family members as key factors in ROS signal transduction activated the ROS-producing and ROS-scavenging networks including AsA-GSH and GPX cycles involved in scavenging H2O2. Finally, elevated antioxidant status and oxidative stress response in the improved dehydration enhanced seedling resistance to cryogenic treatment, maintained ROS homeostasis and improved cell recovery after cryopreservatio.
s are defined by their ability to self-renew and produce daughter cells that proliferate and mature. These maturing cells transition from a proliferative state to a terminal state through the process of differentiation. In the Arabidopsis thaliana root the transcription factors SCARECROW and SHORTROOT regulate specification of the bipotent stem cell that gives rise to cortical and endodermal progenitors. Subsequent progenitor proliferation and differentiation generate mature endodermis, marked by the Casparian strip, a cell-wall modification that prevents ion diffusion into and out of the vasculature. We identified a transcription factor, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 36 (MYB36), that regulates the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the endodermis. We show that SCARECROW directly activates MYB36 expression, and that MYB36 likely acts in a feed-forward loop to regulate essential Casparian strip formation genes. We show that myb36 mutants have delayed and defective barrier formation as well as extra divisions in the meristem. Our results demonstrate that MYB36 is a critical positive regulator of differentiation and negative regulator of cell proliferatio.
tivus stigmas form rich source of apocarotenoids like crocin, picrocrocin and saffranal which besides imparting color, flavour and aroma to saffron spice also have tremendous pharmacological properties. Inspite of their importance, the biosynthetic pathway of Crocus apocarotenoids is not fully elucidated. Moreover, the mechanism of their stigma specific accumulation remains unknown. Therefore, deep transcriptome sequencing of Crocus stigma and rest of the flower tissue was done to identify the genes and transcriptional regulators involved in the biosynthesis of these compound.
tome of stigma and rest of the flower tissue was sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx platform which generated 64,604,402 flower and 51,350,714 stigma reads. Sequences were assembled de novo using trinity resulting in 64,438 transcripts which were classified into 32,204 unigenes comprising of 9853 clusters and 22,351 singletons. A comprehensive functional annotation and gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out. 58.5&nbsp;% of the transcripts showed similarity to sequences present in public databases while rest could be specific to Crocus. 5789 transcripts showed similarity to transcription factors representing 76 families out of which Myb family was most abundant. Many genes involved in carotenoid/apocarotenoid pathway were identified for the first time in this study which includes zeta-carotene isomerase and desaturase, carotenoid isomerase and lycopene epsilon-cyclase. GO analysis showed that the predominant classes in biological process category include metabolic process followed by cellular process and primary metabolic process. KEGG mapping analysis indicated that pathways involved in ribosome, carbon and starch and sucrose metabolism were highly represented. Differential expression analysis indicated that key carotenoid/apocarotenoid pathway genes including phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 2 are enriched in stigma thereby providing molecular proof for stigma to be the site of apocarotenoid biosynthesi.
 would provide a rich source for understanding the carotenoid/apocarotenoid metabolism in Crocus. The database would also help in investigating many questions related to saffron biology including flower developmen.
n of tissue-resident macrophages, crucial for homeostasis and immunity, has remained controversial until recently. Originally described as part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, macrophages were long thought to derive solely from adult blood circulating monocytes. However, accumulating evidence now shows that certain macrophage populations are in fact independent from monocyte and even from adult bone marrow hematopoiesis. These tissue-resident macrophages derive from sequential seeding of tissues by two precursors during embryonic development. Primitive macrophages generated in the yolk sac (YS) from early erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs), independently of the transcription factor c-Myb and bypassing monocytic intermediates, first give rise to microglia. Later, fetal monocytes, generated from c-Myb(+) EMPs that initially seed the fetal liver (FL), then give rise to the majority of other adult macrophages. Thus, hematopoietic stem cell-independent embryonic precursors transiently present in the YS and the FL give rise to long-lasting self-renewing macrophage population.
ated cells are abundant in the epithelial surface of different tissues, including cells lining the walls of the lateral ventricles in the brain and the airway epithelium. Their main role is to control fluid flow and thus defects in their differentiation were implicated in many human disorders such as hydrocephalus, accompanied by defects in adult neurogenesis and mucociliary disorder in the airway system. Here we show that Mcidas, which was mutated in human mucociliary clearance disorder and GemC1/Lynkeas, previously implicated in cell cycle progression, are key regulators of multiciliated ependymal cells generation in the brain. Overexpression and knock down experiments show that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are sufficient and necessary for cell fate commitment and differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated ependymal cells. Furthermore, we show that GemC1/Lynkeas and Mcidas operate in hierarchical order, upstream of Foxj1 and c-Myb transcription factors, known regulators of ependymal cell generation, while Notch signaling is inhibiting their function. Our results suggest that Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas are key players for the generation of multiciliated ependymal cells of the adult neurogenic nich.
ain-helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is an important tumor suppressor gene deleted from 1p36.31 in neuroblastomas (NBs). High CHD5 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, but deletion or low expression is frequent in high-risk tumors. We explored the role of CHD5 expression in the neuronal differentiation of NB cell line.
ines SH-SY5Y (SY5Y), NGP, SK-N-DZ, IMR5, LAN5, SK-N-FI, NB69 and SH-EP were treated with 1-10 μM 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) for 3-12 days. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to measure mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. Morphological differences were examined by both phase contrast and immunofluorescence studie.
 of SY5Y cells with 13cRA caused upregulation of CHD5 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (1, 5, or 10 μM for 7 or 12 days) and also induced neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, both NGP and SK-N-DZ cells showed CHD5 upregulation and neuronal differentiation after 13cRA treatment. In contrast, 13cRA treatment of IMR5, LAN5, or SK-N-FI induced neither CHD5 expression nor neuronal differentiation. NB69 cells showed two different morphologies (neuronal and substrate adherent) after 12 days treatment with 10 μM of 13cRA. CHD5 expression was high in the neuronal cells, but low/absent in the flat, substrate adherent cells. Finally, NGF treatment caused upregulation of CHD5 expression and neuronal differentiation in SY5Y cells transfected to express TrkA (SY5Y-TrkA) but not in TrkA-null parental SY5Y cells, and both changes were blocked by a pan-TRK inhibito.
 with 13cRA induces neuronal differentiation only in NB cells that upregulate CHD5. In addition, NGF induced CHD5 upregulation and neuronal differentiation only in TrkA expressing cells. Together, these results suggest that CHD5 is downstream of TrkA, and CHD5 expression may be crucial for neuronal differentiation induced by either 13cRA or TrkA/NGF signalin.
gress has recently been achieved in the understanding of the genomic alterations driving chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, the specific molecular mechanisms governing chromatin remodeling in CLL are unknown. Here we report the genetic and functional characterization of somatic mutations affecting the chromatin remodeler CHD2, one of the most frequently mutated genes in CLL (5.3%) and in monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL, 7%), a B-cell expansion that can evolve to CLL. Most of the mutations affecting CHD2, identified by whole-exome sequencing of 456 CLL and 43 MBL patients, are either truncating or affect conserved residues in functional domains, thus supporting a putative role for CHD2 as a tumor suppressor gene. CHD2 mutants show altered nuclear distribution, and a chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) mutant affected in its DNA-binding domain exhibits defective association with active chromatin. Clinicobiological analyses show that most CLL patients carrying CHD2 mutations also present mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHVs), being the most frequently mutated gene in this prognostic subgroup. This is the first study providing functional evidence supporting CHD2 as a cancer driver and opens the way to further studies of the role of this chromatin remodeler in CL.
c gene expression is developmentally regulated, in part by chromatin remodelling, and its dysregulation has been linked to cancer. CHD5 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5) is a tumour suppressor gene (TSG) that maps to a region of consistent deletion on 1p36.31&nbsp;in neuroblastomas (NBs) and other tumour types. CHD5 encodes a protein with chromatin remodelling, helicase and DNA-binding motifs that is preferentially expressed in neural and testicular tissues. CHD5 is highly homologous to CHD3 and CHD4, which are the core subunits of nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation (NuRD) complexes. To determine if CHD5 forms a similar complex, we performed studies on nuclear extracts from NBLS, SY5Y (both with endogenous CHD5 expression), NLF (CHD5 null) and NLF cells stably transfected with CHD5 cDNA (wild-type and V5-histidine-tagged). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with either CHD5 antibody or antibody to V5/histidine-tagged protein. We identified NuRD components both by GST-FOG1 (Friend Of GATA1) pull-down and by IP. We also performed MS/MS analysis to confirm the presence of CHD5 or other protein components of the NuRD complex, as well as to identify other novel proteins. CHD5 was clearly associated with all canonical NuRD components, including metastasis-associated protein (MTA)1/2, GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A), histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2, retinoblastoma-binding protein (RBBP)4/7 and methyl DNA-binding domain protein (MBD)2/3, as determined by Western blotting and MS/MS. Our data suggest CHD5 forms a NuRD complex similar to CHD4. However, CHD5-NuRD may also have unique protein associations that confer functional specificity and may contribute to normal development and to tumour suppression in NB and other cancer.

began at a mean of 26 months (12-42) with myoclonic seizures in all 10 cases. Seven exhibited exquisite clinical photosensitivity; 6 self-induced with the television. Absence seizures occurred in 9 patients including typical (4), atypical (2), and absence seizures with eyelid myoclonias (4). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred in 9 of 10 cases with a mean onset of 5.8 years. Convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus were later features (6/10, mean onset 9 years). Tonic (40%) and atonic (30%) seizures also occurred. In 3 cases, an unusual seizure type, the atonic-myoclonic-absence was captured on video. A phenotypic spectrum was identified with 7 cases having moderate to severe intellectual disability and refractory seizures including tonic attacks. Their mean age at onset was 23 months. Three cases had a later age at onset (34 months) with relative preservation of intellect and an initial response to antiepileptic medicatio.
typic spectrum of CHD2 encephalopathy has distinctive features of myoclonic epilepsy, marked clinical photosensitivity, atonic-myoclonic-absence, and intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe. Recognition of this genetic entity will permit earlier diagnosis and enable the development of targeted therapie.
opment and progression of melanoma have been attributed to independent or combined genetic and epigenetic events. There has been remarkable progress in understanding melanoma pathogenesis in terms of genetic alterations. However, recent studies have revealed a complex involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression, including methylation, chromatin modification and remodeling, and the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. The roles of gene methylation and miRNAs have been relatively well studied in melanoma, but other studies have shown that changes in chromatin status and in the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs can lead to altered regulation of key genes. Taken together, they affect the functioning of signaling pathways that influence each other, intersect, and form networks in which local perturbations disturb the activity of the whole system. Here, we focus on how epigenetic events intertwine with these pathways and contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of melanom.
ing mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) cause CHARGE syndrome, a severe multiorgan system disorder of which Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is a minor feature. Recent reports have described predominantly missense CHD7 alleles in IGD patients, but it is unclear if these alleles are relevant to causality or overall genetic burden of Kallmann syndrome (KS) and normosmic form of IGD. To address this question, we sequenced CHD7 in 783 well-phenotyped IGD patients lacking full CHARGE features; we identified nonsynonymous rare sequence variants in 5.2% of the IGD cohort (73% missense and 27% splice variants). Functional analyses in zebrafish using a surrogate otolith assay of a representative set of these CHD7 alleles showed that rare sequence variants observed in controls showed no altered function. In contrast, 75% of the IGD-associated alleles were deleterious and resulted in both KS and normosmic IGD. In two families, pathogenic mutations in CHD7 coexisted with mutations in other known IGD genes. Taken together, our data suggest that rare deleterious CHD7 alleles contribute to the mutational burden of patients with both KS and normosmic forms of IGD in the absence of full CHARGE syndrome. These findings (i) implicate a unique role or preferential sensitivity for CHD7 in the ontogeny of GnRH neurons, (ii) reiterate the emerging genetic complexity of this family of IGD disorders, and (iii) demonstrate how the coordinated use of well-phenotyped cohorts, families, and functional studies can inform genetic architecture and provide insights into the developmental biology of cellular system.
 consists of ordered nucleosomal arrays that are controlled by highly conserved adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. One such remodeler, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (Chd1), is believed to play an integral role in nucleosomal organization, as the loss of Chd1 is known to disrupt chromatin. However, the specificity and basis for the functional and physical localization of Chd1 on chromatin remains largely unknow.
ome-wide approaches, we found that the loss of Chd1 significantly disrupted nucleosome arrays within the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes. We also found that Chd1 is physically recruited to gene bodies, and that its occupancy specifically corresponds to that of the early elongating form of RNA polymerase, RNAPII Ser 5-P. Conversely, RNAPII Ser 5-P occupancy was affected by the loss of Chd1, suggesting that Chd1 is associated with early transcription elongation. Surprisingly, the occupancy of RNAPII Ser 5-P was affected by the loss of Chd1 specifically at intron-containing genes. Nucleosome turnover was also affected at these sites in the absence of Chd1. We also found that deletion of the histone methyltransferase for H3K36 (SET2) did not affect either Chd1 occupancy or nucleosome organization genome-wid.
pecifically recruited onto the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes in an elongation-dependent but H3K36me3-independent manner. Chd1 co-localizes with the early elongating form of RNA polymerase, and affects the occupancy of RNAPII only at genes containing introns, suggesting a role in relieving splicing-related pausing of RNAPI.
g mutations of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8), and of many other genes with diverse functions, are strong-effect risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting multiple mechanisms of pathogenesis. We explored the transcriptional networks that CHD8 regulates in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by reducing its expression and then integrating transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) with genome-wide CHD8 binding (ChIP sequencing). Suppressing CHD8 to levels comparable with the loss of a single allele caused altered expression of 1,756 genes, 64.9% of which were up-regulated. CHD8 showed widespread binding to chromatin, with 7,324 replicated sites that marked 5,658 genes. Integration of these data suggests that a limited array of direct regulatory effects of CHD8 produced a much larger network of secondary expression changes. Genes indirectly down-regulated (i.e., without CHD8-binding sites) reflect pathways involved in brain development, including synapse formation, neuron differentiation, cell adhesion, and axon guidance, whereas CHD8-bound genes are strongly associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Genes associated with ASD were strongly enriched among indirectly down-regulated loci (P &lt; 10(-8)) and CHD8-bound genes (P = 0.0043), which align with previously identified coexpression modules during fetal development. We also find an intriguing enrichment of cancer-related gene sets among CHD8-bound genes (P &lt; 10(-10)). In vivo suppression of chd8 in zebrafish produced macrocephaly comparable to that of humans with inactivating mutations. These data indicate that heterozygous disruption of CHD8 precipitates a network of gene-expression changes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways in which many ASD-associated genes may converge on shared mechanisms of pathogenesi.
odomain helicase/adenosine triphosphatase DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) is a recently identified oncogene localized at 1q21. CHD1L protein over-expression in primary hepatocellular carcinoma is correlated with enhanced apoptosis inhibition, reduced chemosensitivity and shortened patient survival. However, CHD1L protein status or mRNA expression in breast cancer and its clinical significance remain obscur.
tudy, immunohistochemical staining for CHD1L expression was performed on tissue microarrays containing 179 primary invasive breast cancers and 65 matched normal breast tissue specimens. Clinico-pathological features were collected and compared between different CHD1L statuses. Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Also, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was employed to evaluate the mRNA level expression of CHD1L in six breast cancer cell line.
of CHD1L over-expression was observed in 87 of the 179 patients (48.6%), which associated with a younger age (P = 0.011), higher grade (P = 0.004), higher Ki-67 index (P = 0.018) and HER2 over-expression/amplification (P = 0.037). After a median follow-up of 55 months, patients with presence of CHD1L over-expression had significantly poorer DFS (82.6% Vs 76.3%, P = 0.035), but not OS (87.0% Vs 94.9%, P = 0.439). In multivariate analysis, CHD1L status (HR = 2.169, [95%CI, 1.029-4.573], P = 0.042), triple negative subtype (HR = 2.809, [95%CI 1.086-7.264], P = 0.033) and HER2 positive subtype (HR = 5.221, [95%CI 1.788-15.240], P = 0.002) were identified as independent prognostic factors for DFS. In vitro study indicated that relative mRNA expression level of CHD1L was higher in breast cancer cell lines, especially in MDA-MB-231 and LM2-4175, when compared to normal breast epithelial cell lin.
of CHD1L over-expression is probably associated with aggressive tumor biology in breast cancer. CHD1L status might be a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with breast cance.
ndrome is a rare human disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7). Characteristics of CHARGE are varied and include developmental ear and hearing anomalies. Here we report a novel mouse model of CHD7 dysfunction, termed Looper. The Looper strain harbours a nonsense mutation (c.5690C&gt;A, p.S1897X) within the Chd7 gene. Looper mice exhibit many of the clinical features of the human syndrome, consistent with previously reported CHARGE models, including growth retardation, facial asymmetry, vestibular defects, eye anomalies, hyperactivity, ossicle malformation, hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Looper mice display an otosclerosis-like fusion of the stapes footplate to the cochlear oval window and blepharoconjunctivitis but not coloboma. Looper mice are hyperactive and have vestibular dysfunction but do not display motor impairmen.
ous loss of function mutations in CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) lead to CHARGE syndrome, a complex developmental disorder affecting craniofacial structures, cranial nerves and several organ systems. Recently, it was demonstrated that CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest cells, which migrate from the neural tube to many regions of the embryo, where they differentiate into various tissues including craniofacial and heart structures. So far, only few CHD7 target genes involved in neural crest cell development have been identified and the role of CHD7 in neural crest cell guidance and the regulation of mesenchymal-epithelial transition are unknown. Therefore, we undertook a genome-wide microarray expression analysis on wild-type and CHD7 deficient (Chd7 (Whi/+) and Chd7 (Whi/Whi)) mouse embryos at day 9.5, a time point of neural crest cell migration. We identified 98 differentially expressed genes between wild-type and Chd7 (Whi/Whi) embryos. Interestingly, many misregulated genes are involved in neural crest cell and axon guidance such as semaphorins and ephrin receptors. By performing knockdown experiments for Chd7 in Xenopus laevis embryos, we found abnormalities in the expression pattern of Sema3a, a protein involved in the pathogenesis of Kallmann syndrome, in vivo. In addition, we detected non-synonymous SEMA3A variations in 3 out of 45 CHD7-negative CHARGE patients. In summary, we discovered for the first time that Chd7 regulates genes involved in neural crest cell guidance, demonstrating a new aspect in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome. Furthermore, we showed for Sema3a a conserved regulatory mechanism across different species, highlighting its significance during development. Although we postulated that the non-synonymous SEMA3A variants which we found in CHD7-negative CHARGE patients alone are not sufficient to produce the phenotype, we suggest an important modifier role for SEMA3A in the pathogenesis of this multiple malformation syndrom.
ain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) is involved in malignancies. However, the role of CHD1L in gastric cancer (GC) has not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to explore the clinical role of CHD1L in G.
and protein expression levels of CHD1L were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in fresh samples of GC and paired adjacent noncancerous tissue (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;34). We evaluated the CHD1L expression by immunohistochemistry in a large number of GC patients (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;616) and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues from December 1, 2004 to December 1, 2008. The correlations of CHD1L expression with clinicopathological features and clinical outcome were analyze.
and protein expression levels of CHD1L were higher in fresh samples of GC than in paired adjacent noncancerous tissues as determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that positive expression rates of CHD1L in GC and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues were 58.7&nbsp;% (361/616) and 7.3&nbsp;% (45/616), respectively. CHD1L positivity was significantly associated with clinical stage and distant metastasis. GC patients with positive CHD1L expression had shorter overall survival than those with negative CHD1L expression. Multivariate analysis showed that CHD1L was an independent prognostic marker for overall survival [Hazard Ratio (HR)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.952, 95&nbsp;% confidence interval (CI)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.194-11.187, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0043.
ults indicated that CHD1L could serve as a prognostic marker for G.
ation of the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is hampered by their genetic heterogeneity; however, the different genetic alterations leading to ASD seem to be implicated in the disturbance of common molecular pathways or biological processes. In this scenario, the search for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ASD patients and controls is a good alternative to identify the molecular etiology of such disorders. Here, we employed genome-wide expression analysis to compare the transcriptome of stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) of idiopathic autistic patients (n = 7) and control samples (n = 6). Nearly half of the 683 identified DEGs are expressed in the brain (P = 0.003), and a significant number of them are involved in mechanisms previously associated with ASD such as protein synthesis, cytoskeleton regulation, cellular adhesion and alternative splicing, which validate the use of SHEDs to disentangle the causes of autism. Autistic patients also presented overexpression of genes regulated by androgen receptor (AR), and AR itself, which in turn interacts with CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8), a gene recently shown to be associated with the cause of autism and found to be upregulated in some patients tested here. These data provide a rationale for the mechanisms through which CHD8 leads to these diseases. In summary, our results suggest that ASD share deregulated pathways and revealed that SHEDs represent an alternative cell source to be used in the understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the etiology of AS.
ain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5), a member of the CHD family, is involved in key cellular processes including chromatin remodeling, cell cycle regulation, and cellular adhesion. Recent studies have demonstrated that CHD5 is the product of a novel tumor suppressor gene and is implicated in certain tumor types. However, the clinicopathological significance of CHD5 expression in human malignant gliomas remains unclear. To address this problem, CHD5 expression in human gliomas and non-neoplastic brain tissues was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The association of CHD5 immunostaining with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of glioma patients was statistically analyzed. Genetic and protein expression of CHD5 were downregulated in glioma tissues compared to corresponding non-neoplastic brain tissues (both p&lt;0.001). Additionally, decreased expression of CHD5 in glioma was significantly associated with pathological grade (p=0.007); high pathological grade was associated with low CHD5 expression. Loss of CHD5 protein expression was also significantly correlated with a low Karnofsky performance scale score (p=0.01). Moreover, overall survival of patients with low CHD5 protein expression was dramatically shorter than those of patients with high CHD5 protein expression (p=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that CHD5 expression was an independent prognostic factor for patients with gliomas (p=0.01). In conclusion, these data offer convincing evidence for the first time that CHD5 might act as a tumor suppressor in glioma, may act as a regulator of aggressive development, and is a candidate prognostic marker for this malignanc.
-remodeling proteins have a pivotal role in normal cell function and development, catalyzing conformational changes in DNA that ultimately result in changes in gene expression patterns. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), the defining subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is a nucleosome-remodeling protein of the SNF2/ISWI2 family, members of which contain two chromo domains and an ATP-dependent helicase module. CHD3, CHD4 and CHD5 also contain two contiguous PHD domains and have an extended N-terminal region that has not previously been characterized. We have identified a stable domain in the N-terminal region of CHD4 and report here the backbone and side chain resonance assignments for this domain at pH 7.5 and 25 °C (BMRB No. 18906.
nt of the cerebral vessels, pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs). and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) requires multipotent neural crest cells (NCCs) that migrate from the neural tube to target tissue destinations. Little is known about how mammalian NCC development is orchestrated by gene programming at the chromatin level, however. Here we show that Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), an ATPase subunit of the Brg1/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is required in NCCs to direct cardiovascular development. Mouse embryos lacking Brg1 in NCCs display immature cerebral vessels, aberrant PAA patterning, and shortened OFT. Brg1 suppresses an apoptosis factor, Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and a cell cycle inhibitor, p21(cip1), to inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of NCCs, thereby maintaining a multipotent cell reservoir at the neural crest. Brg1 also supports Myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11) expression to allow NCCs to develop into mature vascular smooth muscle cells of cerebral vessels. Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2 promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin to guide NCCs into the OFT. Our findings reveal an important role for Brg1 and its downstream pathways in the survival, differentiation, and migration of the multipotent NCCs critical for mammalian cardiovascular developmen.
 in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 gene (CHD7) lead to CHARGE syndrome, an autosomal dominant multiple malformation disorder. Proteins involved in chromatin remodeling typically act in multiprotein complexes. We previously demonstrated that a part of human CHD7 interacts with a part of human CHD8, another chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein presumably being involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental (NDD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because identification of novel CHD7 and CHD8 interacting partners will provide further insights into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and ASD/NDD, we searched for additional associated polypeptides using the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometr.
rto uncharacterized FAM124B (Family with sequence similarity 124B) was identified as a potential interaction partner of both CHD7 and CHD8. We confirmed the result by co-immunoprecipitation studies and showed a direct binding to the CHD8 part by direct yeast two hybrid experiments. Furthermore, we characterized FAM124B as a mainly nuclear localized protein with a widespread expression in embryonic and adult mouse tissue.
ts demonstrate that FAM124B is a potential interacting partner of a CHD7 and CHD8 containing complex. From the overlapping expression pattern between Chd7 and Fam124B at murine embryonic day E12.5 and the high expression of Fam124B in the developing mouse brain, we conclude that Fam124B is a novel protein possibly involved in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorder.
oloboma of the eye, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia and ear anomalies and/or hearing loss) syndrome is a rare genetic, multiple-malformation syndrome. About 80% of patients with a clinical diagnose, have a mutation or a deletion in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). Genotype-phenotype correlation is only partly known. In this nationwide study, phenotypic characteristics of 18 Danish CHD7 mutation positive CHARGE individuals (N = 18) are presented. We studied patient records, clinical photographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Information was not available for all traits in all subjects. Therefore, the results are presented as fractions. The following prevalence of cardinal symptoms were found: coloboma, 16/17; heart defects, 14/18; choanal atresia, 7/17; retarded growth and development, 11/13; genital abnormalities, 5/18; ear anomalies, 15/17 and sensorineural hearing loss, 14/15. Vestibular dysfunction (10/13) and swallowing problems (12/15) were other frequent cranial nerve dysfunctions. Three-dimensional reconstructions of MRI scans showed temporal bone abnormalities in &gt;85%. CHARGE syndrome present a broad phenotypic spectrum, although some clinical features are more frequently occurring than others. Here, we suggest that genetic testing for CHD7 mutation should be considered in neonates with a specific combination of several clinical symptom.
ain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a newly identified tumor suppressor that is frequently downregulated in a variety of human cancers. Our previous work revealed that the low expression of CHD5 in colorectal cancer is correlated with CHD5 promoter CpG island hypermethylation. In this study, we investigated the effect of microRNA-211 (miR-211)-regulated CHD5 expression on colorectal tumorigenesi.
as predicted to target CHD5 by TargetScan software analysis. A stably expressing exogenous miR-211 colorectal cancer cell line (HCT-116(miR-211)) was generated using lentiviral transduction and used as a model for in vitro and in vivo studies. The expression level of miR-211 in HCT-116(miR-211) cells was upregulated by 16-fold compared to vector control cells (HCT-116(vector)). Exogenous miR-211 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of CHD5 mRNA, resulting in a 50% decrease in CHD5 protein level in HCT-116(miR-211) cells. The levels of cell proliferation, tumor growth, and cell migration of HCT-116(miR-211) cells were significantly higher than HCT-116(vector) cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, as determined using the methods of MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, scratch assay, and tumor xenografts, respectively. In addition, we found that enforced expression of miR-211 in HCT-116 cells was able to alter p53 pathway-associated regulatory proteins, such as MDM2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Ba.
ts demonstrate that CHD5 is a direct target of miR-211 regulation. Enforced expression of miR-211 promotes tumor cell growth at least in part by downregulating the expression level of the CHD5 tumor suppressor. Our results provide a better understanding of the association of between miR-211-regulated CHD5 expression and CHD5 function in colorectal tumorigenesi.
ain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a potent tumor suppressor that serves as a master regulator of a tumor-suppressive network. Examination of the role played by CHD5 in a wide range of human cancers is warranted. In this study, we focused on the epigenetic modification and tumor-suppressive role of CHD5 in lung cancer. We measured CHD5 mRNA and protein expression in lung cancer cells, lung cancer tissues, and their corresponding noncancerous lung tissues using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. We then determined the methylation status of the CHD5 promoter in these samples using methylation-specific sequencing and analyzed CHD5 re-expression in lung cancer cells treated with or without 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methylation. Next, the lung cancer cell clones stably expressing EGFP-CHD5 protein or EGFP protein, respectively, were obtained and the effects of restored CHD5 expression on cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenicity were assessed. CHD5 expression ranged from low to absent in the lung cancer cell lines and tissues examined; the CHD5 promoter was hyperethylated in these samples. Treatment with 5-aza-dC resulted in a localized decrease in methylation density and an increase in CHD5 expression. Clonogenicity and tumor growth were abrogated in A549 and H1299 cells upon restoration of CHD5 expression. A significant reduction in clonogenicity was observed; an average of 47.83 ± 4.6% reduction for A549-EGFP-CHD5 was observed compared to A549-EGFP, and an average of 56.39 ± 5.3% reduction for H1299-EGFP-CHD5 was observed compared to H1299-EGFP. A549-EGFP exhibited an average tumor size of 452.3 ± 36.5 mm(3), whereas A549-EGFP-CHD5 exhibited an average tumor size of only 57.7 ± 18.5 mm(3). Thus, our findings indicate that CHD5 is a potential tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated via an epigenetic mechanism in lung cance.
ain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) has been found to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in malignant neural tumors. In mice heterozygous for chd5 deficiency, the first tumor observed was pathological squamous cell carcinoma. More than 95% of primary laryngeal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, we explored the expression of CHD5 in 65 patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. DNA methylation was detected using bisulfate-specific sequencing. The potential function of CHD5 was determined using MTT, apoptosis and transwell migration assays in CHD5-transfected Hep-2 cells. Our results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of CHD5 in LSCC tissues were significantly lower than those in clear surgical margin tissues (p&lt;0.05), and there is a significant correlation between the mRNA and protein expression levels of CHD5 (p&lt;0.01). In addition, there were significant differences in CHD5 mRNA and protein levels with respect to the patient's clinical stage (p&lt;0.05). Aberrant methylation of the CHD5 promoter was frequently found in the Hep-2 cell line and LSCC tumor tissues, especially tumor tissues from advanced TNM (p&lt;0.05) or older patients (p&lt;0.05). Finally, ectopic expression of CHD5 in laryngeal cancer cells led to significant inhibition of growth and invasiveness. Our data suggest that CHD5 is a tumor suppressor gene that is epigenetically downregulated in LSC.
e chromosomal proteins in concert with histones play important roles in the replication and repair of DNA and in the regulation of gene expression. The deregulation of these proteins can contribute to the development of a variety of diseases such as cancer. As a nonhistone chromosomal protein, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) has recently been identified as the product of a novel tumor suppressor gene (TSG), promoting the transcription of p19ink4a and p16arf. The inactivation of CHD5 was achieved partly through genetic deletion since it is located in 1p36, a region frequently deleted in human tumors. In this study, we aim to study the involvement of CHD5 in gastric cancer, the second most common cancer worldwid.
ession in a panel of gastric cancer cells were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The methylation of CHD5 was evaluated by methylation specific PCR and bisulfite genome sequencing. The effect of CHD5 on growth of gastric cancer cells was tested by colony formation assa.
ession was down-regulated in all of gastric cancer cell lines used (100%, 7/7) and significantly restored after pharmacological demethylation. Methylation of CHD5 promoter was detected in all of seven gastric cancer cell lines and in the majority of primary gastric carcinoma tissues examined (73%, 11/15). Finally, ectopic expression of CHD5 in gastric cancer cells led to a significant growth inhibitio.
a TSG epigenetically down-regulated in gastric cance.
 remodeling is one of the mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated developmentally. Chromatin structure is controlled at least in part by post-translational modification of histones, as well as by chromodomain proteins. We have identified a novel gene encoding a protein with chromatin remodeling, helicase and DNA-binding motifs. This gene, called CHD5, is the fifth member of the CHD gene family identified in humans. This gene is most homologous to CHD3 and CHD4, which encode proteins that are part of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex. CHD5 is preferentially expressed in total brain, fetal brain, and cerebellum. It is also moderately expressed in the adrenal gland, but expression is undetectable in almost all other tissues examined. CHD5 maps within a small region of deletion on 1p36.3 in human neuroblastomas, a common pediatric tumor. We examined a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines for CHD5 expression, which was consistently low or undetectable in all these lines. Expression was also examined in a panel of 137 primary neuroblastomas, and low expression was highly correlated with 1p deletion, MYCN amplification, advanced stage, and unfavorable histology. These findings suggest that this gene may play a role in the development of the nervous system, and it may also play a role in the pathogenesis of neural tumor.
ndrome is a common cause of congenital anomalies. Its rate of incidence is about 1:10,000. It is phenotypically heterogeneous, usually a sporadic or autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a mutation in the CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein) gene. Since the time it was first described by Hall,[1] the knowledge of the clinical characteristics of CHARGE syndrome has increased over the years. Recently, basiocciput hypoplasia and basilar invagination in patients with CHARGE syndrome have been reported. We report here a case of CHARGE syndrome where there is involvement of symmetrical chorioretinal colobomata with craniovertebral junction anomalies. The patient had symmetrical chorioretinal colobomata, external and inner ear anomalies, sensorineural deafness, characteristic facial appearance, retarded growth and development, history of patent ductus arteriosus, and craniovertebral junction anomalies. Craniovertebral junction anomalies may be an under-diagnosed phenotypic expression of CHARGE syndrome. The diagnostic criteria of CHARGE syndrome may require further revision to include the addition of craniovertebral junction anomalie.
ndrome is a rare congenital condition characterized by 6 cardinal features: coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital anomalies, and ear anomalies/deafness. Mutations of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein gene CHD7 are reported to be a major cause of CHARGE syndrome. Herein, we report the case of a 27-year-old patient presenting with typical symptoms who bears a novel heterozygous insertion in exon 2 of the CHD7 gene (c.327dupC) resulting in an amino acid substitution and a frameshift (p.Val110Argfs*22) that leads to a 131-amino-acid truncated polypeptide, likely representing a null allele. Parental genetic screening confirmed the sporadic origin of the mutatio.
 of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) characterized by DNA methylation anomalies are termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)1, CIMP2, or CIMP-negative. The pathogenesis of CIMP1 colorectal carcinomas, and their effects on patients' prognoses and responses to treatment, differ from those of other CRCs. We sought to identify genetic somatic alterations associated with CIMP1 CRC.
ed genomic DNA samples from 100 primary CRCs, 10 adenomas, and adjacent normal-appearing mucosae from patients undergoing surgery or colonoscopy at 3 tertiary medical centers. We performed exome sequencing of 16 colorectal tumors and their adjacent normal tissues. Extensive comparison with known somatic alterations in CRCs allowed segregation of CIMP1-exclusive alterations. The prevalence of mutations in selected genes was determined from an independent cohor.
that genes that regulate chromatin were mutated in CIMP1 CRCs; the highest rates of mutation were observed in CHD7 and CHD8, which encode members of the chromodomain helicase/adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling family. Somatic mutations in these 2 genes were detected in 5 of 9 CIMP1 CRCs. A prevalence screen showed that nonsilencing mutations in CHD7 and CHD8 occurred significantly more frequently in CIMP1 tumors (18 of 42 [43%]) than in CIMP2 (3 of 34 [9%]; P &lt; .01) or CIMP-negative tumors (2 of 34 [6%]; P &lt; .001). CIMP1 markers had increased binding by CHD7, compared with all genes. Genes altered in patients with CHARGE syndrome (congenital malformations involving the central nervous system, eye, ear, nose, and mediastinal organs) who had CHD7 mutations were also altered in CRCs with mutations in CHD.
ns in chromatin remodeling could contribute to the development of CIMP1 CRCs. A better understanding of the biological determinants of CRCs can be achieved when these tumors are categorized according to their epigenetic statu.
ain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) is a regulator of the chromatin remodelling process. The aim was to determine the CHD1, CHD2, CHD3, CHD4, CHD7, CHD8 and CHD9 mutational status of mononucleotide repeats in gastric and colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI.
ts were determined in 28 gastric cancers (GCs) with high MSI (MSI-H), 45 GCs with low MSI (MSI-L)/stable MSI (MSS), 35 colorectal cancers (CRCs) with MSI-H and 45 CRCs with MSI-L/MSS by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. CHD4 and CHD8 expression was also examined in GCs and CRCs by immunohistochemistry. CHD1, CHD2, CHD3, CHD4, CHD7, CHD8 and CHD9 mutations were found in five, 19, three, five, seven, 10 and seven cancers, respectively. They were detected in MSI-H cancers, but not in MSI-L/MSS cancers. Loss of CHD4 expression was observed in 56.4% of the GCs and 55.7% of the CRCs, and loss of CHD8 was observed in 35.7% of the GCs and 28.6% of the CRCs. The cancers with CHD4 and CHD8 mutations showed loss of CHD4 and CHD8 expression, respectivel.
t mutation and loss of expression of CHD genes are common in GCs and CRCs with MSI-H.These alterations might contribute to cancer pathogenesis by deregulating CHD-mediated chromatin remodellin.
 heart defect, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies (CHARGE) syndrome is a genetic syndrome in which hypogonadism is a frequent feature. A causative mutation within the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-7 gene, which plays an important role in the embryonic development, is present in 2/3 of affected patients. We describe the clinical, hormonal and molecular characteristics of a young man from Ecuador who was diagnosed as having CHARGE syndrome at an adult age. The patient showed several phenotypic features of the syndrome, associated with a prepubertal state and cryptorchidism; hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with undetectable testosterone levels not responsive to hCG testing and severe osteoporosis were ascertained. Molecular evaluation of the CHD7 gene showed the novel frameshift truncating heterozygous mutation p.Tyr1046Glyfs*23 in exon 12. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed mild hypoplasia of the pituitary gland and hypoplasia of the posterior cranial fossa. Parenteral testosterone therapy led to sexual development over time and, in combination with diphophonate therapy and calcium-vitamin D supplementation, significantly improved bone mineralisation. Early proper hormonal treatment of hypogonadism in patients with complex genetic syndromes is important to achieve normal sexual maturation, improve quality of life and avoid significant comorbidities, such as osteoporosi.
ndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited multiple malformation disorder typically characterized by coloboma, choanal atresia, hypoplastic semicircular canal, cranial nerve defects, cardiovascular malformations and ear abnormalities. Mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene are the major cause of CHARGE syndrome. Mutation analysis was performed in 18 patients with firm or tentative clinical diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome. In this study eight mutations distributed across the gene were found. Five novel mutations - one missense (c.2936T&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;C), one nonsense (c.8093C&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;A) and three frameshift mutations (c.804_805insAT, c.1757_1770del14, c.1793delA) - were identified. As far as familial data were available these mutations were found to have arisen de novo. Comparison of the clinical features of patients with the same mutation demonstrates that expression of the phenotype is highly variable. The mutation detection rate in this study was 44.4% in patients with a clinically established or suspected diagnosis of CHARGE syndrom.
ic MRI (microMRI) is an emerging technique for high-throughput phenotyping of transgenic mouse embryos, and is capable of visualising abnormalities in cardiac development. To identify cardiac defects in embryos, we have optimised embryo preparation and MR acquisition parameters to maximise image quality and assess the phenotypic changes in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) transgenic mice. microMRI methods rely on tissue penetration with a gadolinium chelate contrast agent to reduce tissue T(1), thus improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in rapid gradient echo sequences. We investigated 15.5 days post coitum (dpc) wild-type CD-1 embryos fixed in gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) solutions for either 3 days (2 and 4 mM) or 2 weeks (2, 4, 8 and 16 mM). To assess penetration of the contrast agent into heart tissue and enable image contrast simulations, T(1) and T(*) (2) were measured in heart and background agarose. Compared to 3-day, 2-week fixation showed reduced mean T(1) in the heart at both 2 and 4 mM concentrations (p &lt; 0.0001), resulting in calculated signal gains of 23% (2 mM) and 29% (4 mM). Using T(1) and T(*) (2) values from 2-week concentrations, computer simulation of heart and background signal, and ex vivo 3D gradient echo imaging, we demonstrated that 2-week fixed embryos in 8 mM Gd-DTPA in combination with optimised parameters (TE/TR/alpha/number of averages: 9 ms/20 ms/60 degrees /7) produced the largest SNR in the heart (23.2 +/- 1.0) and heart chamber contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (27.1 +/- 1.6). These optimised parameters were then applied to an MRI screen of embryos heterozygous for the gene Chd7, implicated in coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retardation of growth, genital/urinary abnormalities, ear abnormalities and deafness (CHARGE) syndrome (a condition partly characterised by cardiovascular birth defects in humans). A ventricular septal defect was readily identified in the screen, consistent with the human phenotyp.
 member of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes. It is mutated in CHARGE syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly condition. CHD7 is one of a subset of CHD proteins, unique to metazoans that contain the BRK domain, a protein module also found in the Brahma/BRG1 family of helicases. We describe here the NMR solution structure of the two BRK domains of CHD7. Each domain has a compact betabetaalphabeta fold. The second domain has a C-terminal extension consisting of two additional helices. The structure differs from those of other domains present in chromatin-associated protein.
 novel chromodomain gene mutated in 60%-80% of humans with CHARGE syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly condition characterized by ocular coloboma, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, and characteristic ear abnormalities including deafness. Phenotypic features of CHARGE are highly variable and incompletely penetrant. To explore developmental roles of CHD7, we generated mice carrying the Chd7(Gt) allele from a Chd7-deficient, gene-trapped lacZ reporter ES cell line. RT-PCR of embryo RNA demonstrated significantly reduced levels of wild-type transcript in Chd7(Gt/Gt) embryos. Chd7(Gt/Gt) embryos survive only up to embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Chd7(Gt/+) male and female mice are viable, small, and exhibit variable degrees of head-bobbing and circling, consistent with vestibular dysfunction. Paint-filling of E16.5 heterozygous inner ears revealed defects of the semicircular canals. The pattern of beta-galactosidase activity in Chd7(Gt/+) embryos mimics Chd7 mRNA expression in wild-type embryos, confirming the fidelity of the lacZ reporter. We observed tissue-specific beta-galactosidase in the E12.5 and E14.5 Chd7(Gt/+) brain, pituitary, ear, heart, and craniofacial structures, indicating survival of Chd7(Gt/+) cells in CHARGE-relevant organs. These studies demonstrate the utility of Chd7(Gt) as a reporter-tagged loss-of-function allele for future studies exploring developmental mechanisms of Chd7 deficienc.
oloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genital anomalies, ear anomalies) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome in which CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) mutations account for about 60% of the cases. There is no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation but the majority of the patients fulfils the diagnostic criteria previously proposed. CHARGE syndrome should be considered in children with facial asymmetry, colobomas or choanal atresia; ear abnormalities are of great diagnostic valu.
l-cytosine binding domain 2 (MBD2)-nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex recognizes methylated DNA and silences expression of associated genes through histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling functions. Our previous structural work demonstrated that a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66α) proteins recruits the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD4/Mi2β) to the NuRD complex and is necessary for MBD2-mediated DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing in vivo (Gnanapragasam, M. N., Scarsdale, J. N., Amaya, M. L., Webb, H. D., Desai, M. A., Walavalkar, N. M., Wang, S. Z., Zu Zhu, S., Ginder, G. D., and Williams, D. C., Jr. (2011) p66α-MBD2 coiled-coil interaction and recruitment of Mi-2 are critical for globin gene silencing by the MBD2-NuRD complex. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 108, 7487-7492). The p66α-MBD2 interaction differs from most coiled-coils studied to date by forming an anti-parallel heterodimeric complex between two peptides that are largely monomeric in isolation. To further characterize unique features of this complex that drive heterodimeric specificity and high affinity binding, we carried out biophysical analyses of MBD2 and the related homologues MBD3, MBD3-like protein 1 (MBD3L1), and MBD3-like protein 2 (MBD3L2) as well as specific mutations that modify charge-charge interactions and helical propensity of the coiled-coil domains. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses show that the individual peptides remain monomeric in isolation even at 300 μM in concentration for MBD2. Circular dichroism analyses demonstrate a direct correlation between helical content of the coiled-coil domains in isolation and binding affinity for p66α. Furthermore, complementary electrostatic surface potentials and inherent helical content of each peptide are necessary to maintain high-affinity association. These factors lead to a binding affinity hierarchy of p66α for the different MBD2 homologues (MBD2 ≈ MBD3 &gt; MBD3L1 ≈ MBD3L2) and suggest a hierarchical regulatory model in tissue and life cycle stage-specific silencing by NuRD complexe.
 remodelling proteins are an essential family of eukaryotic proteins. They harness the energy from ATP hydrolysis and apply it to alter chromatin structure in order to regulate all aspects of genome biology. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is one such remodelling protein that has specialised nucleosome organising abilities and is conserved across eukaryotes. CHD1 possesses a pair of tandem chromodomains that directly precede the core catalytic Snf2 helicase-like domain, and a C-terminal&nbsp;SANT-SLIDE DNA-binding domain. We have identified an additional conserved domain in the C-terminal region of CHD1. Here, we report the backbone and side chain resonance assignments for this domain from human CHD1 at pH 6.5 and 25&nbsp;°C (BMRB No. 25638.
ain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) was identified as a leading autism spectrum disorder (ASD) candidate gene by whole-exome sequencing and subsequent targeted-sequencing studies. De novo loss-of-function mutations were identified in 12 individuals with ASD and zero controls, accounting for a highly significant association. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CHD8 in human neural progenitor cells followed by RNA sequencing revealed that CHD8 insufficiency results in altered expression of 1715  genes, including both protein-coding and noncoding RNAs. Among the 10 most changed transcripts, 4 (40%) were noncoding RNAs. The transcriptional changes among protein-coding genes involved a highly interconnected network of genes that are enriched in neuronal development and in previously identified ASD candidate genes. These results suggest that CHD8 insufficiency may be a central hub in neuronal development and ASD ris.

be here the case of a 54-year-old female developed acute myeloid leukemia with a t(5;21)(q21;q22). Transcriptome sequencing identified the chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 1 gene, CHD1, as a novel partner gene of RUNX1. Furthermore, the patient was found to harbor FLT3-ITD mutation, which might collaborated with CHD1-RUNX1 in the development of acute myeloid leukemi.
dentified CHD1 as the RUNX1 fusion partner in acute myeloid leukemia with t(5;21)(q21;q22.
expression and function of chromatin regulators results in the altered chromatin structure seen in cancer. The chromatin regulator CTCF, its cofactor CHD8, and antagonistic paralogue BORIS have wide-ranging effects on gene regulation. Their concurrent expression and regulation was examined in benign, localized, and metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) arrays with extended follow-up using an automated quantitative imaging system, VECTRA. Epithelial staining was quantified and compared against a range of clinicopathologic variables. CHD8 expression was decreased in HGPIN, localized, and metastatic PCa compared to benign (P &lt; .001). CHD8 promoter hypermethylation, assessed by Quantitative Pyrosequencing, occurred in over 45% of primary cancers in this population as well as the TGCA database. Treatment of cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine reinduced expression. An interesting dichotomy for CHD8 was observed within primary cancers, with higher nuclear protein expression associated with adverse clinical outcomes including extracapsular extension (P = .007), presence of metastases (P = .025) and worse PSA-recurrence free survival (P = .048). CHD8 outperformed Gleason score and predicted biochemical failure within intermediate grade prostate cancers. The BORIS/CTCF expression ratio increased in localized (P = .03) and metastatic PCa (P = .006) and was associated with higher Gleason score (P = .02), increased tumor volume (P = .02) and positive margins (P = .04). Per cell heterogeneity of expression revealed all protein expression to be more heterogeneous in cancerous tissue (both P &lt; .001), especially high grade (P &lt; .01). In the first detailed analysis in cancer, a marked loss of CHD8 expression and increased BORIS/CTCF ratio indicate frequent disruption of CTCF and its effector genes in PC.
criptional program controlling the circadian rhythm requires coordinated regulation of chromatin. Characterization of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding enzyme CHD1 revealed DNA methylation in the promoter of the central clock gene frequency (frq) in Neurospora crassa. In this report, we show that the DNA methylation at frq is not only dependent on the DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 but also on the H3K9 methyltransferase DIM-5 and HP1. Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) occurs at frq and is most prominent 30 min after light-activated expression. Strains lacking dim-5 have an increase in light-induced transcription, and more White Collar-2 is found associated with the frq promoter. Consistent with the notion that DNA methylation assists in establishing the proper circadian phase, loss of H3K9 methylation results in a phase advance suggesting it delays the onset of frq expression. The dim-5 deletion strain displays an increase in circadian-regulated conidia formation on race tubes and there is a synthetic genetic interaction between dim-5 and ras-1(bd). These results indicate DIM-5 has a regulatory role in muting circadian output. Overall, the data support a model where facultative heterochromatic at frq serves to establish the appropriate phase, mute the light response, and repress circadian outpu.
influenza A virus mediates Crm1-dependent vRNP nuclear export through interaction with Crm1. However, even though the nuclear export signal 1 (NES1) of NS2 does not play a requisite role in NS2-Crm1 interaction, there is no doubt that NES1 is crucial for vRNP nuclear export. While the mechanism of the NES1 is still unclear, it is speculated that certain host partners might mediate the NES1 function through their interaction with NES1. In the present study, chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 3 (CHD3) was identified as a novel host nuclear protein for locating NS2 and Crm1 on dense chromatin for NS2 and Crm1-dependent vRNP nuclear export. CHD3 was confirmed to interact with NES1 in NS2, and a disruption to this interaction by mutation in NES1 significantly delayed viral vRNPs export and viral propagation. Further, the knockdown of CHD3 would affect the propagation of the wild-type virus but not the mutant with the weakened NS2-CHD3 interaction. Therefore, this study demonstrates that NES1 is required for maximal binding of NS2 to CHD3, and that the NS2-CHD3 interaction on the dense chromatin contributed to the NS2-mediated vRNP nuclear expor.
mutations or deletions of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) have been linked to cancer and implicate CHD5 in tumor suppression, the ATP-dependent activity of CHD5 is currently unknown. In this study, we discovered that CHD5 is a chromatin remodeling factor with a unique enzymatic activity. CHD5 can expose nucleosomal DNA at one or two discrete positions in the nucleosome. The exposure of the nucleosomal DNA by CHD5 is dependent on ATP hydrolysis, but continued ATP hydrolysis is not required to maintain the nucleosomes in their remodeled state. The activity of CHD5 is distinct from other related chromatin remodeling ATPases, such as ACF and BRG1, and does not lead to complete disruption or destabilization of the nucleosome. Rather, CHD5 likely initiates remodeling in a manner similar to that of other remodeling factors but does not significantly reposition the nucleosome. While the related factor CHD4 shows strong ATPase activity, it does not unwrap nucleosomes as efficiently as CHD5. Our findings add to the growing evidence that chromatin remodeling ATPases have diverse roles in modulating chromatin structur.
e most remarkable chromatin remodelling processes occurs during spermiogenesis, the post-meiotic phase of sperm development during which histones are replaced with sperm-specific protamines to repackage the genome into the highly compact chromatin structure of mature sperm. Here we identify Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (Chd5) as a master regulator of the histone-to-protamine chromatin remodelling process. Chd5 deficiency leads to defective sperm chromatin compaction and male infertility in mice, mirroring the observation of low CHD5 expression in testes of infertile men. Chd5 orchestrates a cascade of molecular events required for histone removal and replacement, including histone 4 (H4) hyperacetylation, histone variant expression, nucleosome eviction and DNA damage repair. Chd5 deficiency also perturbs expression of transition proteins (Tnp1/Tnp2) and protamines (Prm1/2). These findings define Chd5 as a multi-faceted mediator of histone-to-protamine replacement and depict the cascade of molecular events underlying this process of extensive chromatin remodellin.
n essential factor for neuronal differentiation and spermatogenesis and is a known tumor suppressor. H3K27me3 and H3K4un are modifications recognized by Chd5; however, it remains unclear how Chd5 remodels chromatin structure. We completely disrupted the Chd5 locus using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a 52 kbp long deletion and analyzed Chd5 function in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our findings show that Chd5 represses murine endogenous retrovirus-L (MuERV-L/MERVL), an endogenous retrovirus-derived retrotransposon, by regulating H3K27me3 and H3.1/H3.2 function. J. Cell. Biochem. 9999: 1-13, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, In.
studies showed that miR-454 acted as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in cancer. However, its function in HCC remains unknown. In this study, we found that miR-454 expression was upregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues. Knockdown of miR-454 inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas overexpression of miR-454 promoted HCC cell proliferation and invasion and EMT. Furthermore, we identified the CHD5 as a direct target of miR-454. CHD5 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines and the expression level of CHD5 was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-454 in HCC tissues. In addition, knockdown of miR-454 inhibited the growth of HepG2-engrafted tumors in vivo. Taken together, these results indicated that miR-454 functioned as an oncogene in HC.
toma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system that is often lethal when relapse occurs. We here used whole-exome sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, array CGH and DNA methylation analysis to characterize 16 paired samples at diagnosis and relapse from individuals with neuroblastoma. The mutational burden significantly increased in relapsing tumors, accompanied by altered mutational signatures and reduced subclonal heterogeneity. Global allele frequencies at relapse indicated clonal mutation selection during disease progression. Promoter methylation patterns were consistent over disease course and were patient specific. Recurrent alterations at relapse included mutations in the putative CHD5 neuroblastoma tumor suppressor, chromosome 9p losses, DOCK8 mutations, inactivating mutations in PTPN14 and a relapse-specific activity pattern for the PTPN14 target YAP. Recurrent new mutations in HRAS, KRAS and genes mediating cell-cell interaction in 13 of 16 relapse tumors indicate disturbances in signaling pathways mediating mesenchymal transition. Our data shed light on genetic alteration frequency, identity and evolution in neuroblastom.
atin remodeler CHD5 plays a critical role in tumor suppression and neurogenesis in mammals. CHD5 contributes to gene expression during neurogenesis, but there is still much to learn regarding how this class of remodelers contributes to differentiation and development. CHD5 remodelers are vertebrate-specific, raising the prospect that CHD5 plays one or more conserved roles in this phylum. Expression of chd5 in adult fish closely mirrors expression of CHD5 in adult mammals. Knockdown of Chd5 during embryogenesis suggests new roles for CHD5 remodelers based on resulting defects in craniofacial development including reduced head and eye size as well as reduced cartilage formation in the head. In addition, knockdown of Chd5 results in altered expression of neural markers in the developing brain and eye as well as a profound defect in differentiation of dopaminergic amacrine cells. Recombinant zebrafish Chd5 protein exhibits nucleosome remodeling activity in vitro, suggesting that it is the loss of this activity that contributes to the observed phenotypes. Our studies indicate that zebrafish is an appropriate model for functional characterization of CHD5 remodelers in vertebrates and highlight the potential of this model for generating novel insights into the role of this vital class of remodeler.
tion of growth factor signaling plays a pivotal role in controlling the malignancy phenotype and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the precise oncogenic mechanisms underlying transcription regulation of certain tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) by growth factors are poorly understood. In the present study, we report a novel insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathway that mediates de novo DNA methylation and TSG (such as DLC1 and CHD5) silencing by upregulation of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) via an AKT/β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP)-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in HCC. Analysis of DNA methylation in CpG islands of target genes revealed high co-localization of DNMT1 and DNMT3B on the promoters of TSGs associated with enhanced CpG hypermethylation. Our results point to a novel epigenetic mechanism for growth factor-mediated repression of TSG transcription that involves DNA methylatio.
he chromatin remodeling ATPase CHD5 has been linked to the progression of neuroblastoma tumors, yet the underlying mechanisms behind the tumor suppressor role of CHD5 are unknown. In this study, we purified the human CHD5 complex and found that CHD5 is a component of the full NuRD transcriptional repressor complex, which also contains methyl-CpG binding proteins and histone deacetylases. The CHD5/NuRD complex appears mutually exclusive with the related CHD4/NuRD complex as overexpression of CHD5 results in loss of the CHD4 protein in cells. Following a search for genes that are regulated by CHD5 in neuroblastoma cells, we found that CHD5 binds to and represses the G2/M checkpoint gene WEE1. Reintroduction of CHD5 into neuroblastoma cells represses WEE1 expression, demonstrating that CHD5 can function as a repressor in cells. A catalytically inactive mutant version of CHD5 is able to associate with a NuRD cofactor but fails to repress transcription. Our study shows that CHD5 is a NuRD-associated transcriptional repressor and identifies WEE1 as one of the CHD5-regulated genes that may link CHD5 to tumor suppressio.
1p36 syndrome is the most commonly observed subtelomeric deletion syndrome. Patients with this syndrome typically have common clinical features, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, and characteristic craniofacial feature.
ation with academic societies, we analyzed the genomic copy number aberrations using chromosomal microarray testing. Finally, the genotype-phenotype correlation among them was examine.
ed clinical information of 86 patients who had been diagnosed with chromosomal deletions in the 1p36 region. Among them, blood samples were obtained from 50 patients (15 males and 35 females). The precise deletion regions were successfully genotyped. There were variable deletion patterns: pure terminal deletions in 38 patients (76%), including three cases of mosaicism; unbalanced translocations in seven (14%); and interstitial deletions in five (10%). Craniofacial/skeletal features, neurodevelopmental impairments, and cardiac anomalies were commonly observed in patients, with correlation to deletion size.
ype-phenotype correlation analysis narrowed the region responsible for distinctive craniofacial features and intellectual disability into 1.8-2.1 and 1.8-2.2 Mb region, respectively. Patients with deletions larger than 6.2 Mb showed no ambulation, indicating that severe neurodevelopmental prognosis may be modified by haploinsufficiencies of KCNAB2 and CHD5, located at 6.2 Mb away from the telomere. Although the genotype-phenotype correlation for the cardiac abnormalities is unclear, PRDM16, PRKCZ, and RERE may be related to this complication. Our study also revealed that female patients who acquired ambulatory ability were likely to be at risk for obesit.
osome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin-associated protein complex. Although the subunit composition of the mammalian complex is fairly well characterized, less is known about the stability and dynamics of these interactions. Furthermore, detailed information regarding protein-protein interaction surfaces within the complex is still largely lacking. Here, we show that the NuRD complex interacts with a number of substoichiometric zinc finger-containing proteins. Some of these interactions are salt-sensitive (ZNF512B and SALL4), whereas others (ZMYND8) are not. The stoichiometry of the core subunits is not affected by high salt concentrations, indicating that the core complex is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, the RBBP4 and RBBP7 proteins are sensitive to high nonionic detergent concentrations during affinity purification. In a subunit exchange assay with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-treated nuclear extracts, RBBP4 and RBBP7 were identified as dynamic core subunits of the NuRD complex, consistent with their proposed role as histone chaperones. Finally, using cross-linking MS, we have uncovered novel features of NuRD molecular architecture that complement our affinity purification-MS/MS data. Altogether, these findings extend our understanding of MBD3-NuRD structure and stabilit.

ification and characterization of the cellular and molecular pathways involved in the differentiation and morphogenesis of specific cell types of the developing heart are crucial to understanding the process of cardiac development and the pathology associated with human congenital heart disease. Here, we show that the cardiac transcription factor CASTOR (CASZ1) directly interacts with congenital heart disease 5 protein (CHD5), which is also known as tryptophan-rich basic protein (WRB), a gene located on chromosome 21 in the proposed region responsible for congenital heart disease in individuals with Down's syndrome. We demonstrate that loss of CHD5 in Xenopus leads to compromised myocardial integrity, improper deposition of basement membrane, and a resultant failure of hearts to undergo cell movements associated with cardiac formation. We further report that CHD5 is essential for CASZ1 function and that the CHD5-CASZ1 interaction is necessary for cardiac morphogenesis. Collectively, these results establish a role for CHD5 and CASZ1 in the early stages of vertebrate cardiac developmen.
dent nucleosome remodelers of the CHD family play important roles in chromatin regulation during development and differentiation. The ubiquitously expressed CHD3 and CHD4 proteins are essential for stem cell function and serve to orchestrate gene expression in different developmental settings. By contrast, the closely related CHD5 is predominantly expressed in neural tissue and its role is believed to be restricted to neural differentiation. Indeed, loss of CHD5 contributes to neuroblastoma. In this study, we first demonstrate that CHD5 is a nucleosome-stimulated ATPase. We then compare CHD3/4 and CHD5 expression in mouse brain and show that CHD5 expression is restricted to a subset of cortical and hippocampal neurons whereas CHD3/4 expression is more widespread. We also uncover high levels of CHD5 expression in testis. CHD5 is transiently expressed in differentiating germ cells. Expression is first detected in nuclei of post-meiotic round spermatids, reaches a maximum in stage VIII spermatids and then falls to undetectable levels in stage IX spermatids. Surprisingly, CHD3/4 and CHD5 show complementary expression patterns during spermatogenesis with CHD3/4 levels progressively decreasing as CHD5 expression increases. In spermatocytes, CHD3/4 localizes to the pseudoautosomal region, the X centromeric region and then spreads into the XY body chromatin. In postmeiotic cells, CHD5 colocalises with macroH2A1.2 in association with centromeres and part of the Y chromosome. The subnuclear localisations of CHD4 and CHD5 suggest specific roles in regulation of sex chromosome chromatin and pericentromeric chromatin structure prior to the histone-protamine switc.
creened chromosome arm 3L for ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations that disrupt localization of fluorescently labeled gurken (grk) messenger (m)RNA, whose transport along microtubules establishes both major body axes of the developing Drosophila oocyte. Rapid identification of causative mutations by single-nucleotide polymorphism recombinational mapping and whole-genomic sequencing allowed us to define nine complementation groups affecting grk mRNA localization and other aspects of oogenesis, including alleles of elg1, scaf6, quemao, nudE, Tsc2/gigas, rasp, and Chd5/Wrb, and several null alleles of the armitage Piwi-pathway gene. Analysis of a newly induced kinesin light chain allele shows that kinesin motor activity is required for both efficient grk mRNA localization and oocyte centrosome integrity. We also show that initiation of the dorsoanterior localization of grk mRNA precedes centrosome localization, suggesting that microtubule self-organization contributes to breaking axial symmetry to generate a unique dorsoventral axi.
ain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) has recently been identified as a potent tumour suppressor by acting as a master regulator of a tumour-suppressive network. Its inactivation resulted from aberrant methylation in the promoter occurs in several types of human malignancy and is associated with malignant tumour behaviour. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHD5 gene expression, methylation status and tumour-suppressive function have not been elucidate.
tudy, we focused on the epigenetic modification and tumour-suppressive mechanism of CHD5 gene in HC.
ession in nine HCC cell lines and 30 pairs of HCC specimens and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were analysed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting. Methylation-specific sequencing and methylation-specific PCR were performed to examine DNA methylation status of the CHD5 promoter in HCC cell lines and samples. The effect of CHD5 restoration on proliferation, colony formation, senescence, apoptosis and tumourigenicity were examine.
ession was sinificantly down-regulated in HCC cell lines and tissues examined, and the -841 to -470 region of CHD5 promoter was hypermethylated in these samples. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a striking regional demethylation of the -841 to -470 region of CHD5 promoter and an increase in CHD5 expression. The restoration of CHD5 expression inhibited tumour cell proliferation, colony formation and tumourigenicity and caused cellular senescenc.
ngs demonstrate that CHD5 is a potential tumour suppressor gene epigenetically silenced in HC.
ain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) was previously proposed to function as a potent tumor suppressor by acting as a master regulator of a tumor-suppressive network. CHD5 is down-regulated in several cancers, including leukemia and is responsible for tumor generation and progression. However, the mechanism of CHD5 down-regulation in leukemia is largely unknown. In this study, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analyses revealed that CHD5 was down-regulated in human leukemia cell lines and samples. Luciferase reporter assays showed that most of the baseline regulatory activity was localized from 500 to 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Bisulfite DNA sequencing of the identified regulatory element revealed that the CHD5 promoter was hypermethylated in human leukemia cells and samples. Thus, CHD5 expression was inversely correlated with promoter DNA methylation in these samples. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) activates CHD5 expression in human leukemia cell lines. In vitro luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that methylation of the CHD5 promoter repressed its promoter activity. Furthermore, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay combined with qualitative PCR identified activating protein 2 (AP2) as a potential transcription factor involved in CHD5 expression and indicated that treatment with DAC increases the recruitment of AP2 to the CHD5 promoter. In vitro transcription-factor activity studies showed that AP2 over-expression was able to activate CHD5 promoter activity. Our findings indicate that repression of CHD5 gene expression in human leukemia is mediated in part by DNA methylation of its promote.
first identified because of its location on 1p36 in a region of frequent deletion in neuroblastomas. CHD5 (chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding-5) is the fifth member of a family of chromatin remodeling proteins, and it probably functions by forming a nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex that regulates transcription of particular genes. CHD5 is preferentially expressed in the nervous system and testis. On the basis of its position, pattern of expression, and function in neuroblastoma cells and xenografts, CHD5 was identified as a tumor suppressor gene (TSG). Evidence soon emerged that CHD5 also functioned as a TSG in gliomas and a variety of other tumor types, including breast, colon, lung, ovary, and prostate cancers. Although one copy of CHD5 is deleted frequently, inactivating mutations of the remaining allele are rare. However, DNA methylation of the CHD5 promoter is found frequently, and this epigenetic mechanism leads to biallelic inactivation. Furthermore, low CHD5 expression is strongly associated with unfavorable clinical and biologic features as well as outcome in neuroblastomas and many other tumor types. Thus, based on its likely involvement as a TSG in neuroblastomas, gliomas, and many common adult tumors, CHD5 may play an important developmental role in many other tissues besides the nervous system and testi.
amage response (DDR) promotes genome integrity and serves as a cancer barrier in precancerous lesions but paradoxically may promote cancer survival. Genes that activate the DDR when dysregulated could function as useful biomarkers for outcome in cancer patients. Using a siRNA screen in human pancreatic cancer cells, we identified the CHD5 tumor suppressor as a gene, which, when silenced, activates the DDR. We evaluated the relationship of CHD5 expression with DDR activation in human pancreatic cancer cells and the association of CHD5 expression in 80 patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by immunohistochemical analysis with clinical outcome. CHD5 depletion and low CHD5 expression in human pancreatic cancer cells lead to increased H2AX-Ser139 and CHK2-Thr68 phosphorylation and accumulation into nuclear foci. On Kaplan-Meier log-rank survival analysis, patients with low CHD5 expression had a median recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 5.3 vs 15.4 months for patients with high CHD5 expression (P=0.03). In 59 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, low CHD5 expression was associated with decreased RFS (4.5 vs 16.3 months; P=0.001) and overall survival (OS) (7.2 vs 21.6 months; P=0.003). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, low CHD5 expression remained associated with worse OS (HR: 3.187 (95% CI: 1.49-6.81); P=0.003) in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, low CHD5 expression activates the DDR and predicts for worse OS in patients with resected PAC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings support a model in which dysregulated expression of tumor suppressor genes that induce DDR activation can be utilized as biomarkers for poor outcom.
plays an important role in human innate immunity by causing bacterial cell lysis. We describe for the first time, the actual performance of human lysozyme g-like 2 (HLysG2), a mammalian g-type lysozyme. RT-PCR revealed that the HLysG2 gene was transcribed in eye and testis tissues. A spot was detected from human tears using 2D gel electrophoresis and was identified as HLysG2 using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and a MASCOT search with a matching score of 140 and 27% sequence coverage of the whole amino acid sequence. To gain insight into the in vitro antimicrobial activities of HLysG2, the mature peptide-coding region was cloned into Pichia pastoris for heterogeneous expression. Recombinant HLysG2, had an optimal at pH 6.0 and 30 °C, reached the peak activity of 1.2 × 10(4)U/mg at the sodium ion concentration of 75 mM and showed a higher salt tolerance than human c-type lysozyme (HLysC). Recombinant HlysG2 inhibited Gram-positive bacterial growth and did not inhibit Gram-negative bacterial and Candida albicans growth. Results indicated that HLysG2 is a potent antibacterial protein that may play a role in the innate immunity of the human ey.
n genetic diversity and phylogeny of slow-growing rhizobia isolated from Vigna radiata at main ecotypes of China were conducted by using 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 16S-23S rRNA IGS PCR-RFLP assays. Results of 16S rRNA gene PCR RFLP analysis reveal that all the strains tested are clustered into three groups at the similarity of 76%. Group I contains 13 slow-growing rhizobia tested including LYG1; Group II consists of 21 strains tested and the type strains of B. japonicum and B. liaoningense, and 10 tested strains isolated from Guangdong, Guangxi and the type strain of B. elkanii compose Group III . The results of 16S-23S rRNA IGS PCR-RFLP show that strains tested could be divided into A and B groups, which could be correspondently subdivided into A I , A II , AIII , BI and B II subgroups at the similarity of 85% . Compared with 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP, IGS RFLP assay show higher resolution, strains and reference strains tested can be divided into 21 IGS RFLP patterns. The strains isolated from Xinjiang, Guangdong and Guangxi regions show obvious geographical effect on genetic diversit.
ors have described an increase in total serum IgE values during the first few months of immunotherapy (IT), followed by a subsequent decrease. In previous studies in patients undergoing medium-term IT, we detected an IgE synthesis suppressor factor (SF), which was modified during the course of IT. In this study, we investigated the influence of long-term IT on the production of SF and the lymphocyte response to its stimulus. Mixed bidirectional cultures of lymphocytes isolated from healthy individuals (n = 62) and allergic patients (n = 98) were carried out after different periods of IT. The resulting supernatants were subjected to affinity chromatography, from which two fractions were obtained: the first one, likely to contain SF, was added to lymphocyte cultures from 13 allergic patients undergoing no IT (LyG1) and 6 allergic patients with &gt; 3 years of IT (LyG5), in order to assess its inhibitory effect on IgE synthesis. We found that patients undergoing IT for &gt; 3 years presented a significant increase in SF production and an important lymphocyte response to exogenous SF from most of the groups studied, but little response to their own SF. These results could be ascribed to an alteration in the quantity and/or structure of the lymphocyte receptors likely to be sensitive to these factors induced by I.
us studies we described isotype-specific but antigen non-restricted soluble factors produced by human lymphocytes. In subsequent studies we demonstrated changes in the production of these factors during the course of immunotherapy (IT) by testing them on lymphocytes from normal healthy controls and allergic patients. Through these studies we confirmed that there exists a difference in lymphocytes' responsiveness to soluble factors between both groups. In this report, we investigated the effect of soluble factors on lymphocytes from allergic patients without IT (LyG1) and with IT longer than 2 years (LyG4). Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy controls and allergic patients at different time periods of IT, and bidirectional mixed cultures were performed with the isolated lymphocytes. Supernatants obtained from chromatography were tested on lymphocytes of allergic patients without IT and with IT greater than 2 years to determine their effect on IgE synthesis. Long periods of IT reduce the production of Suppressor Factors (SF) by allergic patients as well as their responsiveness. Long periods of IT increase the responsiveness of lymphocytes of allergic patients to Enhancing Factors (EF) and decrease EF production. We propose a &quot;receptor hypothesis&quot; to explain these event.
STK11 tumor suppressor encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which coordinates cell growth, polarity, motility, and metabolism. In non-small cell lung carcinoma, LKB1 is somatically inactivated in 25% to 30% of cases, often concurrently with activating KRAS mutations. Here, we used an integrative approach to define novel therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven LKB1-mutant lung cancers. High-throughput RNA interference screens in lung cancer cell lines from genetically engineered mouse models driven by activated KRAS with or without coincident Lkb1 deletion led to the identification of Dtymk, encoding deoxythymidylate kinase (DTYMK), which catalyzes dTTP biosynthesis, as synthetically lethal with Lkb1 deficiency in mouse and human lung cancer lines. Global metabolite profiling showed that Lkb1-null cells had a striking decrease in multiple nucleotide metabolites as compared with the Lkb1-wild-type cells. Thus, LKB1-mutant lung cancers have deficits in nucleotide metabolism that confer hypersensitivity to DTYMK inhibition, suggesting that DTYMK is a potential therapeutic target in this aggressive subset of tumor.
gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes deoxythymidylate (dTMP) kinase and is required for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication in both the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. All cdc8 temperature-sensitive mutants are partially defective in meiotic and mitochondrial functions at the permissive temperature. In a study of revertants of temperature-sensitive cdc8 mutants, the SOE201 and SOE1 mutants were isolated. The SOE201 mutant is a disome of chromosome X to which the cdc8 gene maps. Using the chromosome X aneuploids to vary cdc8 gene dosage, we demonstrate that different levels of dTMP kinase activity are required for mitotic, meiotic or mitochondrial DNA replication. The SOE1 mutant contains a dominant suppressor that suppresses five different cdc8 alleles but does not suppress a complete cdc8 deletion. The SOE1 gene is located less than 1.5 cM from the CYH2 gene on chromosome VII and is adjacent to the TSM437-CYH2 region, with the gene order being SOE1-TSM437-CYH2. SOE1 is an inefficient suppressor that can neither suppress the cdc8 hypomorphic phenotype nor restore dTMP kinase activity in vitro. SOE1 is a single C to T mutation in the anticodon of a tRNA(3Glu) gene and thereby, produces a missense suppressor tRNA capable of recognizing AAA lysine codons. We propose that the resultant lysine to glutamate change stabilizes thermo-labile dTMP kinase molecules in the cel.
te kinase is the product of the CDC8 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Jong, A.Y.S., Kuo, C.-L., and Campbell, J.L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11052-11059). In this communication we report the catalytic properties of the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxythymidine monophosphate to form deoxythymidine diphosphate in the presence of phosphate donor. ATP and dATP are the most efficient phosphate donors. In addition to dTMP, the yeast enzyme can use dUMP and 5-iodo-dUMP as phosphate acceptors. Kinetic analysis gives a Km of 0.5 mM for dTMP and 2 mM for dUMP. dTMP has a 7-fold greater rate constant than dUMP. Thymidylate kinase requires a divalent cation and is active over the entire range of pH from 6 to 9. The relative inhibitory effects of related compounds on yeast thymidylate kinase activity are in the order of dTDP greater than thymidine greater than 5-iodo-dUMP greater than ADP greater than or equal to dADP greater than dUMP greater than dTTP greater than dUDP, if dTMP is used as the phosphate acceptor. dTDP is a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki of 0.62 mM. Subcellular fractionation indicates that thymidylate kinase is found in the combined nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction but not in the mitochondri.
te kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine 5'-monophosphate to thymidine 5'-diphosphate in the pathway of synthesis of dTTP from dTMP. We have purified the enzyme approximately 5000-fold from a plasmid-bearing strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that over produces the activity 6-fold. The protein appears homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis and has a molecular weight of 25,000. The amino acid composition and the sequence of amino acids on the NH2 terminus have been determined. Our interest in thymidylate kinase stems from the fact that R. A. Sclafani and W. Fangman (personal communication) recently presented genetic evidence that this enzyme is encoded by the CDC8 gene of yeast. In this paper, we show, by several biochemical criteria, that thymidylate kinase is the product of the CDC8 gene. First, extracts of strains bearing six different alleles of cdc8 show no thymidylate kinase activity. Secondly, strains carrying the CDC8 gene on a high-copy-number plasmid produce 6-fold higher levels of the kinase activity than does wild type. Third, the DNA sequence of the CDC8 gene reveals an open reading frame that encodes a protein with the same amino-terminal sequence as purified thymidylate kinas.
 reports the construction of Escherichia coli in-frame deletion strains of tmk, which encodes thymidylate kinase, Tmk. The tmk gene is located at the third position of a putative five-gene operon at 24.9 min on the E. coli chromosome, which comprises the genes pabC, yceG, tmk, holB, and ycfH. To avoid potential polar effects on downstream genes of the operon, as well as recombination with plasmid-encoded tmk, the tmk gene was replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene kka1, encoding amino glycoside 3'-phosphotransferase kanamycin kinase. The kanamycin resistance gene is expressed under the control of the natural promoter(s) of the putative operon. The E. coli tmk gene is essential under any conditions tested. To show functional complementation in bacteria, the E. coli tmk gene was replaced by thymidylate kinases of bacteriophage T4 gp1, E. coli tmk, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc8, or the Homo sapiens homologue, dTYMK. Growth of these transgenic E. coli strains is completely dependent on thymidylate kinase activities of various origin expressed from plasmids. The substitution constructs show no polar effects on the downstream genes holB and ycfH with respect to cell viability. The presented transgenic bacteria could be of interest for testing of thymidylate kinase-specific phosphorylation of nucleoside analogues that are used in therapies against cancer and infectious disease.
esized that rapamycin, through induction of autophagy and promotion of an antiapoptotic phenotype, would permit lentiviral (LV)-based transgene delivery to human T-Rapa cells, which are being tested in phase II clinical trials in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Manufactured T-Rapa cells were exposed to supernatant enriched for a LV vector encoding a fusion protein consisting of truncated CD19 (for cell surface marking) and DTYMK/TMPKΔ, which provides &quot;cell-fate control&quot; due to its ability to phosphorylate (activate) AZT prodrug. LV-transduction in rapamycin-treated T-Rapa cells: (1) resulted in mitochondrial autophagy and a resultant antiapoptotic phenotype, which was reversed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA; (2) yielded changes in MAP1LC3B and SQSTM1 expression, which were reversed by 3-MA; and (3) increased T-Rapa cell expression of the CD19-DTYMKΔ fusion protein, despite their reduced proliferative status. Importantly, although the transgene-expressing T-Rapa cells expressed an antiapoptotic phenotype, they were highly susceptible to cell death via AZT exposure both in vitro and in vivo (in a human-into-mouse xenogeneic transplantation model). Therefore, rapamycin induction of T cell autophagy can be used for gene therapy applications, including the CD19-DTYMKΔ cell-fate control axis to improve the safety of T cell immuno-gene therap.
 the impact of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) drug-pathway genes on cytotoxicity, and determine whether loss-of-function analyses coupled with functional assays can help prioritize pharmacogenomic candidate gene.
onse experiments were used to quantify the phenotype of sensitivity to 5-FU following the specific knockdown of genes selected from the 5-FU PharmGKB drug pathway in three human colorectal cell lines. Changes in sensitivity were considered significant if the IC(50) for shRNA-exposed cells were three standard deviations outside the mean IC(50) for control-treated cell.
 genes analyzed, 13 produced significant changes on the phenotype of sensitivity to 5-FU (DHFR, DPYS, DTYMK, DUT, FPGS, GGH, NME1, NT5C, RRM1, TYMS, UCK2, UNG and UMPS.
screening strategy enabled prioritization of the genes from the 5-FU drug pathway. Further validation of the genes credentialed in this study should include gene activity or expression and mutation analyses of clinical sample.
ous study showed high frequency of allelic loss at chromosome 2q37 region in oral cancer. This location contains several candidate tumor suppressor genes such as PPP1R7, ILKAP, DTYMK and ING5. We previously showed 3 members of inhibitor of growth (ING) family, ING1, ING3 and ING4 as tumor suppressor gene in head and neck cancer. As ING5 shows high homology with other members of ING genes including highly conserved carboxy-terminal plant homeodomain and nuclear localization signal, we first picked up ING5 and examined it as a possible tumor suppressor in oral cancer. For this aim, mutation and mRNA expression status of ING5 in paired normal and oral squamous cell carcinoma samples were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Three missense mutations located within leucine zipper like (LZL) finger and novel conserved region (NCR) domains in ING5 protein were detected, probably abrogating its normal function. We also found 5 different alternative splicing variants of ING5. Then, we examined mRNA level of ING5 by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, which demonstrated decreased expression of ING5 mRNA in 61% of the primary tumors as compared to the matched normal samples. In conclusion, tumor-specific mutation and downregulation of ING5 mRNA suggested it as a tumor suppressor gene in oral squamous cell carcinom.
atechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea could reverse multidrug resistance (MDR) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. This study was to investigate the mechanism of reversing effect of EGCG on MDR of human hepatocelluar carcinoma cell lines BEL7404/ADM and BEL7402/5-F.
itivity of BEL7404/ADM and BEL7402/5-FU cells was tested by MTT assay. The different gene expression profiles of BEL7404/ADM and BEL7402/5-FU cells were detected by cDNA microarray before and after treatment of EGCG. The expression of MDR1 and LRP genes was detemined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the expression of Cyclin G1 protein was detected by Western blot to confirm the results of cDNA microarra.
nhibitory concentration (IC10) of EGCG was 24.76 mg/L for BEL7404/ADM cells and 20.60 mg/L for BEL7402/5-FU cells. When treated with 0.05 mg/L adriamycin (ADM) and 100 micromol/L 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination, 20 mg/L EGCG reversed the MDR by 9.66 folds in BEL7404/ADM cells and by 2.36 folds in BEL7402/5-FU cells. After treatment of EGCG, 210 differentially expressed genes were identified in BEL7404/ADM cells: 38 were up-regulated and 172 were down-regulated; the potential MDR-related genes included the up-regulated ABCB10 (MDR/TAP), TOP2A, TOP2B, CCNG1, and down-regulated ABCB1, MVP, ARHD, HDAC5, GSS, GSTPI, HSPA1B, HSPB7, CDKN1A, RAB11B, RAB9P40. After treatment of EGCG, 179 differentially expressed genes were identified in BEL7402/5-FU cells: 31 were up-regulated and 148 were down-regulated; the potential MDR-related genes included the up-regulated ABCG (BCRP), CCNG2, GADD34, RB1, RBBP4, and down-regulated DTYMK, GPX1, USP5, BAX, BAK1, HSPA1L. The down-regulation of MDR1 and LRP expression was confirmed by RT-PCR; the up-regulation of Cyclin G1 expression was confirmed by Western blo.
d reverse the MDR of BEL7404/ADM and BEL7402/5-FU cells, but the changes of gene expression profiles of these two HCC cell lines are differen.
racil (5-FU) is the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, but resistance to 5-FU remains a major obstacle to successful therapy. We generated 5-FU-resistant derivatives of the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line by serial passage of these cells in the presence of increasing 5-FU concentrations in an attempt to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in resistance to 5-FU. Two resultant resistant derivatives, HCT116 ResB and ResD, were characterized for resistance phenotypes, genotypes, and gene expression using cells maintained long-term in 5-FU-free media. Compared to parental HCT116 cells that respond to 5-FU challenge by inducing high levels of apoptosis, ResB and ResD derivatives had significantly reduced apoptotic fractions when transiently challenged with 5-FU. ResB and ResD cells were respectively 27- and 121-fold more resistant to 5-FU, had increased doubling times, and significantly increased plating efficiencies compared to the parental cells. Both resistant derivatives retained the wild-type TP53 genotype, TP53 copy number and CGH profile characteristic of the parental line. Alterations in gene expression in the resistant derivatives compared to the parental line were assessed using oligonucleotide microarrays. Overall, the 5-FU-resistant derivatives were characterized by reduced apoptosis and a more aggressive growth phenotype, consistent with the observed up-regulation of apoptosis-inhibitory genes (e.g., IRAK1, MALT1, BIRC5), positive growth-regulatory genes (e.g., CCND3, CCNE2, CCNF, CYR61), and metastasis genes (e.g., LMNB1, F3, TMSNB), and down-regulation of apoptosis-promoting genes (e.g., BNIP3, BNIP3L, FOXO3A) and negative growth-regulatory genes (e.g., AREG, CCNG2, CDKN1A, CDKN1C, GADD45A). 5-FU metabolism-associated genes (e.g., TYMS, DTYMK, UP) and DNA repair genes (e.g., FEN1, FANCG, RAD23B) were also up-regulated in one or both resistant derivatives, suggesting that the resistant derivatives might be able to overcome both 5-FU inhibition of thymidylate synthase and the DNA damage caused by 5-FU, respectively. Development of 5-FU resistance thus appears to encompass deregulation of apoptosis-, proliferation-, DNA repair-, and metastasis-associated regulatory pathway.
te kinase (TMPK) is a key enzyme for pyrimidine synthesis that catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP) in the presence of ATP and Mg(2+) to form thymidine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP), which is then converted to thymidine 5'-triphosphate (dTTP) by nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK). TMPK has an important function in cell proliferation and its enzyme kinetics and related structures have been determined in various organisms. TMPK is well recognized as a potential drug target, with the most notable function being in the activation of anti-HIV nucleoside prodrugs. Recent studies have shown that TMPK is a validated target for antibiotic development against gram-positive bacterium of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, inhibition of human TMPK increases the potential of anticancer agent doxorubicin toward colon cancer cells regardless of p53 status. Following the rapid expanding knowledge on TMPKs and the rising interests in TMPKs as a drug target, in this review we try to describe current research on TMPKs in various organisms of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses and to provide information for designing new potential inhibitors against TMPK.
asing prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, which is resistant to effective multiple antibiotic, presents a major global health threat. The thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.&nbsp;tuberculosis), which is an essential enzyme for the maintenance of the thymidine triphosphate pools, is considered an attractive target for the development of effective antibiotics against tuberculosis. In this study, we attempted to identify novel chemical compounds that specifically target the M.&nbsp;tuberculosis TMPK (mtTMPK). We performed in silico structure-based drug screening using the crystal structure data of mtTMPK and a large-scale virtual compound library, which is composed of 6,192,930 chemicals. Through a three-step screening method using the DOCK and GOLD, we identified ten chemical compounds that were predicted to have high binding affinity to the active site cleft of the mtTMPK. We then evaluated the antibiotic effects of these chemical compounds on model mycobacteria strains. As a result, we found that a chemical compound, K10, completely inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (M.&nbsp;vanbaalenii) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M.&nbsp;smegmatis). Moreover, K10 does not exhibit any toxic effects on the growth of enterobacteria and mammalian cells. The structural and experimental information regarding this novel chemical compound, K10, is likely to be useful for the hit-to-lead optimization of new antibiotics for the treatment of tuberculosi.
 markers predicting sensitivity to anticancer drugs are important and useful not only for selecting potential responders but also for developing new combinations. In the present study, we analyzed the difference in the sensitivity of xenograft models to capecitabine (Xeloda®), 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR, doxifluridine, Furtulon®) and 5-FU by comparing the mRNA levels of 12 pyrimidine nucleoside-metabolizing enzymes. Amounts of mRNA in the tumor tissues of 80 xenograft models were determined by real-time RT-PCR and mutual correlations were examined. A clustering analysis revealed that the 12 enzymes were divided into two groups; one group consisted of 8 enzymes, including orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT), TMP kinase (TMPK) and UMP kinase (UMPK), and was related to the de&nbsp;novo synthesis pathway for nucleotides, with mRNA expression levels showing significant mutual correlation. In the other group, 4 enzymes, including thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), were involved in the salvage/degradation pathway of the nucleotides, and the mRNA levels of this group were dispersed more widely than that of the de&nbsp;novo group. Antitumor activity was assessed in 24 xenograft models for each drug. The antitumor activity of capecitabine and 5'-DFUR correlated significantly with the mRNA levels of TP and with the TP/DPD ratio, whereas the activity of 5-FU correlated significantly with OPRT, TMPK, UMPK and CD. In a stepwise regression analysis, TP and DPD were found to be independent predictive factors of sensitivity to capecitabine and 5'-DFUR, and UMPK was predictive of sensitivity to 5-FU. These results indicate that the predictive factors for sensitivity to capecitabine and 5'-DFUR in xenograft models may be different from those for 5-FU, suggesting that these drugs may have different responders in clinical usag.
 monophosphate kinase (TMPK(mt)) is an essential enzyme for nucleotide metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and thus an attractive target for novel antituberculosis agents. In this work, we have explored the chemical space around the 2',3'-bicyclic thymidine nucleus by designing and in silico screening of a virtual focused library selected via structure based methods to identify more potent analogs endowed with favorable ADME-related properties. In all the library members we have exchanged the ribose ring of the template with a cyclopentane moiety that is less prone to enzymatic degradation. In addition, we have replaced the six-membered 2',3'-ring by a number of five-membered and six-membered heterocyclic rings containing alternative proton donor and acceptor groups, to exploit the interaction with the carboxylate groups of Asp9 and Asp163 as well as with several cationic residues present in the vicinity of the TMPK(mt) binding site. The three-dimensional structure of the TMPK(mt) complexed with 5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP, an analog of dTMP, was employed to develop a QSAR model, to parameterize a scoring function specific for the TMPK(mt) target and to select analogues which display the highest predicted binding to the target. As a result, we identified a small highly focused combinatorial subset of bicyclic thymidine analogues as virtual hits that are predicted to inhibit the mycobacterial TMPK in the submicromolar concentration range and to display favorable ADME-related propertie.
sis still remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases. The emergence of drug resistant strains has fuelled the quest for novel drugs and drug targets for its successful treatment. Thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) lies at the point where the salvage and de novo synthetic pathways meet in nucleotide synthesis. TMPK in M.tb has emerged as an attractive drug target since blocking it will affect both the pathways involved in the thymidine triphosphate synthesis. Moreover, the unique differences at the active site of TMPK enzyme in M.tb and humans can be exploited for the development of ideal drug candidates. Based on a detailed evaluation of known inhibitors and available three-dimensional structures of TMPK, several peptidic inhibitors were designed. In silico docking and selectivity analysis of these inhibitors with TMPK from M.tb and human was carried out to examine their differential binding at the active site. The designed tripeptide, Trp-Pro-Asp, was found to be most selective for M.tb. The ADMET analysis of this peptide indicated that it is likely to be a drug candidate. The tripeptide so designed is a suitable lead molecule for the development of novel TMPK inhibitors as anti-tubercular drug.
emisynthesis based on native chemical ligation has become a major protein engineering tool that allows manipulation of domains of proteins of all sizes. It helps to overcome limitations in chemical protein synthesis set by the inherent size limits of solid phase peptide synthesis. Here we present a semisynthesis approach that provides access to N-terminally-modified variants of human thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK). This enzyme is intimately involved in activating nucleoside-based drugs directed against viral infections such as HIV and against certain types of cancers. The option to chemically synthesize and manipulate the first 30 amino acids of this enzyme via protein semisynthesis allows direct substitution of vital amino acids in the P-loop of this enzyme for probing the mechanism of phosphate transfer and direct observation of substrate or inhibitor binding. Efficient native chemical ligation of two N-terminal segments, one comprising the wild type sequence and one containing a small fluorescent probe, provides milligram amounts of two semisynthetic TMPK variants. An efficient folding procedure in the presence of substrate nucleotides provides access to active semisynthetic TMPK variant.
sis (TB) is the primary cause of mortality among infectious diseases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis monophosphate kinase (TMPKmt) is essential to DNA replication. Thus, this enzyme represents a promising target for developing new drugs against TB. In the present study, the receptor-independent, RI, 4D-QSAR method has been used to develop QSAR models and corresponding 3D-pharmacophores for a set of 81 thymidine analogues, and two corresponding subsets, reported as inhibitors of TMPKmt. The resulting optimized models are not only statistically significant with r(2) ranging from 0.83 to 0.92 and q(2) from 0.78 to 0.88, but also are robustly predictive based on test set predictions. The most and the least potent inhibitors in their respective postulated active conformations, derived from each of the models, were docked in the active site of the TMPKmt crystal structure. There is a solid consistency between the 3D-pharmacophore sites defined by the QSAR models and interactions with binding site residues. Moreover, the QSAR models provide insights regarding a probable mechanism of action of the analogue.
te kinase (TMPK) is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of thymidine monophosphate to thymidine diphosphate. TMPK also mediates phosphorylation of monophosphates of thymidine nucleoside analog (NA) prodrugs on the pathway to their active triphosphate antiviral or antitumor moieties. Novel transgenic mice (TG) expressing human (h) TMPK were genetically engineered using the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive its cardiac-targeted overexpression. In '2 by 2' protocols, TMPK TGs and wild-type (WT) littermates were treated with the NA zidovudine (a deoxythymidine analog, 3'-azido-3'deoxythymidine (AZT)) or vehicle for 35 days. Alternatively, TGs and WTs were treated with a deoxycytidine NA (racivir, RCV) or vehicle. Changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance and mitochondrial ultrastructure were defined quantitatively by real-time PCR and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Cardiac performance was determined echocardiographically. Results showed TMPK TGs treated with either AZT or RCV exhibited decreased cardiac mtDNA abundance. Cardiac ultrastructural changes were seen only with AZT. AZT-treated TGs exhibited increased left ventricle (LV) mass. In contrast, LV mass in RCV-treated TGs and WTs remained unchanged. In all cohorts, LV end-diastolic dimension remained unchanged. This novel cardiac-targeted overexpression of hTMPK helps define the role of TMPK in mitochondrial toxicity of antiretroviral.
 monophosphate kinase (TMPK) has emerged as an attractive target for developing inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. In this study the receptor-independent (RI) 4D-QSAR formalism has been used to develop QSAR models and corresponding 3D-pharmacophores for a set of 5'-thiourea-substituted alpha-thymidine inhibitors. Models were developed for the entire training set and for a subset of the training set consisting of the most potent inhibitors. The optimized (RI) 4D-QSAR models are statistically significant (r(2) = 0.90, q(2) = 0.83 entire set, r(2) = 0.86, q(2) = 0.80 high potency subset) and also possess good predictivity based on test set predictions. The most and least potent inhibitors, in their respective postulated active conformations derived from the models, were docked in the active site of the TMPK crystallographic structure. There is a solid consistency between the 3D-pharmacophore sites defined by the QSAR models and interactions with binding site residues. This model identifies new regions of the inhibitors that contain pharmacophore sites, such as the sugar-pyrimidine ring structure and the region of the 5'-arylthiourea moiety. These new regions of the ligands can be further explored and possibly exploited to identify new, novel, and, perhaps, better antituberculosis inhibitors of TMPKmt. Furthermore, the 3D-pharmacophores defined by these models can be used as a starting point for future receptor-dependent antituberculosis drug design as well as to elucidate candidate sites for substituent addition to optimize ADMET properties of analog inhibitor.
anthracis is well known in connection with biological warfare. The search for new drug targets and antibiotics is highly motivated because of upcoming multiresistant strains. Thymidylate kinase is an ideal target since this enzyme is at the junction of the de novo and salvage synthesis of dTTP, an essential precursor for DNA synthesis. Here the expression and characterization of thymidylate kinase from B. anthracis (Ba-TMPK) is presented. The enzyme phosphorylated deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP) efficiently with K (m) and V (max) values of 33 microM and 48 micromol mg(-1) min(-1), respectively. The efficiency of deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate phosphorylation was approximately 10% of that of dTMP. Several dTMP analogs were tested, and D-FMAUMP (2'-fluoroarabinosyl-5-methyldeoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate) was selectively phosphorylated with an efficiency of 172% of that of D-dTMP, but L-FMAUMP was a poor substrate as were 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (5FdUMP) and 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine-5'-monophosphate (d4TMP). No activity could be detected with 3'-azidothymidine-5'-monophosphate (AZTMP). The corresponding nucleosides known as efficient anticancer and antiviral compounds were also tested, and d-FMAU was a strong inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 10 microM, while other nucleosides--L-FMAU, dThd, 5-FdUrd, d4T, and AZT, and 2'-arabinosylthymidine--were poor inhibitors. A structure model was built for Ba-TMPK based on the Staphylococcus aureus TMPK structure. Docking with various substrates suggested mechanisms explaining the differences in substrate selectivity of the human and the bacterial TMPKs. These results may serve as a start point for development of new antibacterial agent.
rial DNA synthesis requires the supply of thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) independent of nuclear DNA replication. In resting and differentiating cells that withdraw from the cell cycle, mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) mediates thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) formation for the dTTP biosynthesis in mitochondria. However, a thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) that phosphorylates dTMP to form thymidine diphosphate (dTDP) in mitochondria remains undefined. Here, we identified an expressed sequence tag cDNA, which encodes a TMPK with a mitochondrial import sequence at its N-terminus designated as TMPK2. HeLa cells expressing TMPK2 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) displayed green fluorescence in mitochondria. Over-expression of TMPK2 increased the steady-state level of cellular dTTP and promoted the conversion of radioactive labeled-thymidine and -dTMP to dTDP and dTTP in mitochondria. TMPK2 RNA was detected in several tissues and erythroblastoma cell lines. We also generated TMPK2 antibody and used it for immunofluorescence staining to demonstrate endogenous expression of TMPK2 in mitochondria of erythroblastoma cells. Finally, we showed that TMPK2 protein expression was upregulated in monocyte/macrophage differentiating cells, suggesting the coordinated regulation of TMPK2 expression with the terminal differentiation progra.
 thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) emerged as an attractive target for developing inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. The elucidation of the X-ray structure of TMPK of M. tuberculosis (TMPKmt), as well as the structure of an earlier serendipitously discovered dimeric thymidine inhibitor, laid the foundation for the design of potent and selective TMPKmt inhibitors reported here. Several hits identified within a series of 3'-C-branched thiourea-substituted beta-thymidine derivatives inspired us to construct a set of 5'-thiourea-substituted alpha-thymidine derivatives characterized by a similar relative orientation of the thymine and arylthiourea moieties. alpha-Thymidine derivative 15, featuring a (3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)thiourea moiety, has a Ki of 0.6 microM and a selectivity index of 600 versus human TMPK. Moreover, it represents the first TMPK inhibitor showing good inhibitory activity on growing M. bovis (MIC99 = 20 microg/mL) and M. tuberculosis (MIC50 = 6.25 microg/mL) strain.
 describe the synthesis and conformational analysis of a series of bicyclic thymidine derivatives and their evaluation as inhibitors of thymidine monophosphate kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TMPKmt), based on previously discovered bicyclic sugar nucleosides. With a K(i) value of 2.3 microm, 1-[3-aminomethyl-3,5-dideoxy-2-O,6-N-(thiocarbonyl)-beta-D-ribofuranosyl]thymine emerged as the most potent TMPK inhibitor of this series. Moreover, this promising compound displays inhibitory potency against Mycobacteria cultures with an IC(99) value of 100 microg mL(-1), thus promoting TMPKmt for the first time as a validated target for further inhibitory design. Attempts to rationalise the observed structure-activity relationship (SAR) involving molecular modelling and conformational analysis are describe.
ensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies were carried out on deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) derivatives inhibiting thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Molecular field analysis (MFA) models with three different alignment techniques, namely, least squares, pharmacophore based and receptor based methods were developed. Receptor based MFA model showed better results when compared with least squares and pharmacophore based models. The results help us to understand the nature of substituents required for activity and thereby provide guidelines to design novel and potent inhibitors as antitubercular agent.
ide analogs are a new class of antiviral and anticancer agents, several of which are currently used in the clinic. The phosphorylation of these agents to the triphosphate form is thought to be important for exertion of their pharmacological activities. 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-L-arabinofuranosyl)-5-methyluracil (L-FMAU; Clevudine) is a thymidine analog that is currently under phase III clinical trials as an anti-human hepatitis B virus agent. We examined the behavior of its monophosphate metabolite with human recombinant thymidylate kinase (TMPK) and showed that L-FMAU monophosphate (L-FMAUMP) is a poorer substrate than its D-configuration anomer (D-FMAUMP). The phosphorylation efficiency of l-FMAUMP is similar to that of the monophosphate of 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (d4T), an anti-human immunodeficiency virus analog, both of which are approximately 1% TMP. To clarify the role of human TMPK in the phosphorylation of L-FMAUMP to the diphosphate metabolite in cells, a Tet-On inducible human TMPK cell line system was established. In this system, the expression of TMPK is closely regulated in response to various concentrations of doxycycline. When the cells were treated with L-FMAU or d4T, the amounts of the diphosphate and triphosphate metabolites of these analogs were increased, in accordance with an increase in human TMPK activity in cells. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration of the behavior of TMPK toward L-FMAUMP. This study indicates that human TMPK can phosphorylate L-FMAUMP and play a critical role in L-FMAU metabolism in cell.
lic and acyclic analogues of dTMP and AZTMP were synthesized from the corresponding cycloSal-phosphotriesters. This method yielded the nucleotides in good yields with a simple work-up. Investigation of the substrate properties of the modified nucleotides towards TmpK showed, that they are very poor substrates for this key enzyme in the bioactivation of AZ.
 monophosphate kinase (TMPK) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TMPKmt) represents an attractive target for blocking the bacterial DNA synthesis. In an attempt to find high-affinity inhibitors of TMPKmt, a cavity in the enzyme at the 3'-position was explored via the introduction of various substituents at the 3'-position of the thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) scaffold. Various 3'-C-branched chain substituted nucleotides in the 2'-deoxyribo (3-6) and ribo series (7, 8) were synthesized from one key intermediate (23). 2'-Deoxy analogues proved to be potent inhibitors of TMPKmt: 3'-CH(2)NH(2) (4), 3'-CH(2)N(3) (3), and 3'-CH(2)F (5) nucleotides exhibit the highest affinities within this series, with K(i) values of 10.5, 12, and 15 microM, respectively. These results show that TMPKmt tolerates the introduction of sterically demanding substituents at the 3'-position. Ribo analogues experience a significant affinity decrease, which is probably due to steric hindrance of Tyr103 in close vicinity of the 2'-position. Although the 5'-O-phosphorylated compounds have somewhat higher affinities for the enzyme, the parent nucleosides generally exhibit affinities for TMPKmt in the same order of magnitude and display a superior selectivity profile versus human TMPK. This series of inhibitors holds promise for the development of a new class of antituberculosis agent.
 monophosphate kinase (TMPK) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TMPKmt) is an attractive target for the design of specific inhibitors. This fact is the result of its key role in the thymidine pathway and of unique structural features in the active site observed by X-ray crystallography, especially in comparison to its human counterpart (TMPKh). Different 5-modified thymidine derivatives, as well as purine and pyrimidine analogues or C-nucleosides were tested on TMPKmt and TMPKh, and the results were rationalized by docking studies. 5-Halogenated 2'-deoxyuridines are the best inhibitors of TMPKmt found and present the highest selectivity indexes in favor of TMPKm.
e analogue prodrugs are dependent on efficient intracellular stepwise phosphorylation to their triphosphate form to become therapeutically active. In many cases it is this activation pathway that largely determines the efficacy of the drug. To gain further understanding of the determinants for efficient conversion by the enzyme thymidylate kinase (TMPK) of clinically important thymidine monophosphate analogues to the corresponding diphosphates, we solved the crystal structures of the enzyme, with either ADP or the ATP analogue AppNHp at the phosphoryl donor site, in complex with TMP, AZTMP (previous work), NH2TMP, d4TMP, ddTMP, and FLTMP (this work) at the phosphoryl acceptor site. In conjunction with steady-state kinetic data, our structures shed light on the effect of 3'-substitutions in the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) sugar moiety on the catalytic rate. We observe a direct correlation between the rate of phosphorylation of an NMP and its ability to induce a closing of the enzyme's phosphate-binding loop (P-loop). Our results show the drastic effects that slight modifications of the substrates exert on the enzyme's conformation and, hence, activity and suggest the type of substitutions that are compatible with efficient phosphorylation by TMP.
 kinase (TK) and thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are the two rate-limiting enzymes in the cascade of activation of the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) to its active triphosphate form. We examined the effect of ethanol and a combination of ethanol and AZT on TK and TMPK activities in human Jurkat T cell.
cells were exposed to 0.2 and 0.5% (v/v) ethanol concentrations alone or in combination with 5 or 10 microM AZT for 48 hr in growth medium. TK and TMPK activities were determined by measuring the conversion of [3H] substrates (thymidine or AZT for TK and thymidine monophosphate for TMPK) to their respective monophosphate or diphosphate forms. The effect of ethanol on the transcriptional activity of TK was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and on the growth of Jurkat cells by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell-cycle analysi.
 of Jurkat cells with 0.2 and 0.5% ethanol concentrations resulted in 25 and 50% decreases (p &lt; or = 0.05) in TK activity, respectively. No significant changes were observed in the TMPK activities. However, ethanol decreased the formation of thymidine diphosphate from thymidine in coupled TK/TMPK reactions, suggesting that decreases in TK activity could result in an overall decrease in the phosphorylation of AZT. The effect of ethanol on TK was independent of its transcript level. AZT in combination with ethanol decreased the inhibitory effect of ethanol on TK activity. However, it did not block the ethanol effect even at higher concentrations. Ethanol significantly decreased the proliferative capacity and cell cycle progression of the Jurkat cell.
tro study in human Jurkat T cells indicates that at physiologically achievable concentrations in humans, ethanol can decrease TK activity through decreases in cell proliferation, and it suggests that ethanol ingestion in HIV-1-infected individuals could compromise activation of AZT and related drugs through decreased TK activit.
f the favourable results of the short-term therapy of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with glyceryl-trinitrate (GTN) infusion, we undertook a randomized study to test the hypothesis whether the administration of a single dose of isosorbide 5-mononitrate (IS 5-MN) given orally would have the same favourable haemodynamic effect as observed with GTN infusion. For this purpose we evaluated the haemodynamic effects of IS 5-MN compared to isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), observed in the same group of patients. 10 patients (8 males, 2 females) aged 50-76 years (mean 63) with AMI (7 anterior, 3 inferior) admitted to the coronary care unit within 48 h from onset of symptoms were entered into this single-blind randomized study; at the time of study entry, 8 patients were in Killip class I, and 2 patients in Killip class II. All drugs with haemodynamic effects were withdrawn 12 h before the study started. Both the haemodynamic profile and the clinical status were stable in all patients. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded with a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter, cardiac output was measured by the thermodilution method, and the left ventricular ejection time was calculated according to the Weissler method. The echo left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was measured by evaluation of the M-mode echocardiographic recording.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORD.
en demonstrated that atrial remodeling contributes toward atrial fibrillation (AF) maintenance and angiotensin II (AngII) is involved in the pathogenesis of atrial remodeling. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonists have been shown to inhibit atrial remodeling. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study we investigated the regulating effects of PPAR-γ agonist on AngII-induced atrial structural and electrical remodeling in vitro cellular models. The effects of pioglitazone on AngII-induced connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression and cell proliferation were assessed in primary-cultured mouse atrial fibroblasts. The influences of pioglitazone on AngII-induced L-type calcium channel (ICa-L) α1c expression and current density were evaluated in atrial myocytes (HL-1). Pioglitazone attenuated AngII-induced CTGF expression and proliferation in atrial fibroblasts, and pioglitazone also inhibited the expression or phosphorylation of AngII-induced transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), TGF-β-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) and Smad2/3. In HL-1 cells, pioglitazone suppressed AngII-induced ICa-L α1c expression and current density as well as CAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. Besides, pioglitazone inhibited AngII-induced production of AngII type I receptor (AT1R) and downregulation of PPAR-γ in both atrial fibroblasts and HL-1 cells. In conclusion, Pioglitazone suppresses AngII-induced CTGF expression and proliferation in atrial fibroblasts, which might be at least in part related with its inhibitory effects on TGF-β1/Smad2/3 and TGF-β1/TRAF6/TAK1 signaling pathways. Moreover, pioglitazone also attenuates AngII-induced ICa-L remodeling in HL-1 cells, which might be at least in part associated with its inhibitory effect on CREB phosphorylation. It is suggested that PPAR-γ agonist may have potential applications in preventing atrial remodelin.
hatidic acid (LPA) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of ovarian cancers. Previous studies have shown that LPA stimulates the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells via Gα12. The present study utilizing Protein/DNA array analyses of LPA-stimulated HeyA8 cells in which the expression of Gα12 was silenced, demonstrates for the first time that Gα12-dependent mitogenic signaling by LPA involves the atypical activation cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). Results indicate that the robust activation of CREB by LPA is an early event that can be monitored by the phosphorylation of SER133 of CREB as early as 3min. The findings that the expression of the constitutively activated mutant of Gα12 stimulates CREB even in the absence of LPA in multiple ovarian cancer cell lines confirm the direct role of Gα12 in the activation of CREB. This is further substantiated by the observation that the silencing of Gα12 drastically attenuates LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB. Our results also establish that LPA-Gα12-dependent activation of CREB is through a cAMP-independent, but Ras-ERK-dependent mechanism. More significantly, our findings indicate that the expression of the dominant negative S133A mutant of CREB leads to a reduction in LPA-stimulated proliferation of HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells. Thus, results presented here demonstrate for the first time that CREB is a critical signaling node in LPA-LPAR and Gα12/gep proto-oncogene stimulated oncogenic signaling in ovarian cancer cell.
ation of β2-agonists triggers skeletal muscle anabolism and hypertrophy. We investigated the time course of the molecular events responsible for rat skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to 1, 3 and 10 days of formoterol administration (i.p. 2000μg/kg/day). A marked hypertrophy of rat tibialis anterior muscle culminated at day 10. Phosphorylation of Akt, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1 and ERK1/2 was increased at day 3, but returned to control level at day 10. This could lead to a transient increase in protein translation and could explain previous studies that reported increase in protein synthesis following β2-agonist administration. Formoterol administration was also associated with a significant reduction in MAFbx/atrogin-1 mRNA level (day 3), suggesting that formoterol can also affect protein degradation of MAFbx/atrogin1 targeted substrates, including MyoD and eukaryotic initiation factor-3f (eIF3-f). Surprisingly, mRNA level of autophagy-related genes, light chain 3 beta (LC3b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (Gabarapl1), as well as lysosomal hydrolases, cathepsin B and cathepsin L, was significantly and transiently increased after 1 and/or 3 days, suggesting that autophagosome formation would be increased in response to formoterol administration. However, this has to be relativized since the mRNA level of Unc-51-like kinase1 (Ulk1), BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein3 (Bnip3), and transcription factor EB (TFEB), as well as the protein content of Ulk1, Atg13, Atg5-Atg12 complex and p62/Sqstm1 remained unchanged or was even decreased in response to formoterol administration. These results demonstrate that the effects of formoterol are mediated, in part, through the activation of Akt-mTOR pathway and that other signaling pathways become more important in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass with chronic administration of β2-agonist.
c AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) initiates transcriptional responses to a wide variety of stimuli. CREB activation involves its phosphorylation on Ser-133, which promotes interaction between the CREB kinase-inducible domain (KID) and the KID-interacting domain of the transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). The KID also contains a highly conserved phosphorylation cluster, termed the ATM/CK cluster, which is processively phosphorylated in response to DNA damage by the coordinated actions of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and casein kinases (CKs) 1 and 2. The ATM/CK cluster phosphorylation attenuates CBP binding and CREB transcriptional activity. Paradoxically, it was recently reported that DNA damage activates CREB through homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-271 near the CREB bZIP DNA binding domain. In this study we sought to further clarify DNA damage-dependent CREB phosphorylation as well as to explore the possibility that the ATM/CK cluster and Ser-271 synergistically or antagonistically modulate CREB activity. We show that, rather than being induced by DNA damage, Ser-270 and Ser-271 of CREB cophosphorylated in a CDK1-dependent manner during G2/M phase. Functionally, we show that phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-270/Ser-271 during mitosis correlated with reduced CREB chromatin occupancy. Furthermore, CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of CREB in vitro inhibited its DNA binding activity. The combined results suggest that CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-270/Ser-271 facilitates its dissociation from chromatin during mitosis by reducing its intrinsic DNA binding potentia.
and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is an islet peptide that promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta cells via cAMP/PKA-dependent pathways. In addition, CART is a regulator of neuronal survival. In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous CART 55-102 on beta cell viability and dissected its signaling mechanisms. Evaluation of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation revealed that CART 55-102 reduced glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis in both INS-1 (832/13) cells and isolated rat islets. Glucotoxicity in INS-1 (832/13) cells also caused a 50% reduction of endogenous CART protein. We show that CART increased proliferation in INS-1 (832/13) cells, an effect that was blocked by PKA, PKB, and MEK1 inhibitors. In addition, CART induced phosphorylation of CREB, IRS, PKB, FoxO1, p44/42 MAPK, and p90RSK in INS-1 (832/13) cells and isolated rat islets, all key mediators of cell survival and proliferation. Thus, we demonstrate that CART 55-102 protects beta cells against glucotoxicity and promotes proliferation. Taken together our data point to the potential use of CART in therapeutic interventions targeted at enhancing functional beta cell mass and long-term insulin secretion in T2.
 is activated in many types of cancer. Phosphorylation of p65 at serine 276 is required for the expression of a subset of NF-kappaB regulated genes, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Thus, inhibition of serine 276 phosphorylation may prevent metastasis and angiogenesis in certain tumor types. Using in silico molecular docking, small molecules that are predicted to bind to a structural pocket near serine 276 were identified. One compound, NSC-127102, hinders serine 276 phosphorylation and the expression of IL-8 and VCAM-1. Small molecules such as NSC-127102 may be optimized for the future treatment of cance.
 compounds reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis are linked to many health benefits such increased longevity, improved energy utilization, and protection from reactive oxygen species. Previously studies have shown that mice and rats fed diets lacking in pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) have reduced mitochondrial content. Therefore, we hypothesized that PQQ can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in mouse hepatocytes. Exposure of mouse Hepa1-6 cells to 10-30 microm PQQ for 24-48 h resulted in increased citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activity, Mitotracker staining, mitochondrial DNA content, and cellular oxygen respiration. The induction of this process occurred through the activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a pathway known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. PQQ exposure stimulated phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133, activated the promoter of PGC-1alpha, and increased PGC-1alpha mRNA and protein expression. PQQ did not stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis after small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in either PGC-1alpha or CREB expression. Consistent with activation of the PGC-1alpha pathway, PQQ increased nuclear respiratory factor activation (NRF-1 and NRF-2) and Tfam, TFB1M, and TFB2M mRNA expression. Moreover, PQQ protected cells from mitochondrial inhibition by rotenone, 3-nitropropionic acid, antimycin A, and sodium azide. The ability of PQQ to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis accounts in part for action of this compound and suggests that PQQ may be beneficial in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunctio.
ecule inhibitors of protein kinases have contributed immensely to our understanding of biological signaling pathways and have been exploited therapeutically for the treatment of cancers and other disease states. The pyridinyl imidazole compounds SB 203580 and SB 202190 were identified as ATP competitive antagonists of the p38 stress-activated protein kinases and have been widely used to elucidate p38-dependent cellular processes. Here, we identify SB 203580 and SB 202190 as potent inhibitors of stress-induced CREB phosphorylation on Serine 111 (Ser-111) in intact cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the inhibitory activity of SB 203580 and SB 202190 on CREB phosphorylation was independent of p38, but instead correlated with inhibition of casein kinase 1 (CK1) in vitro. The inhibition of CK1-mediated CREB phosphorylation by concentrations of pyridinyl imidazoles commonly employed to suppress p38, suggests that in some cases conclusions of p38-dependence derived solely from the use of these inhibitors may be invali.
C expression and activity is regulated by a variety of hormones including beta-adrenergic agonists via the second messenger cAMP. We evaluated the early intermediate pathways involved in the up-regulation of SGK1 by DbcAMP and whether SGK1 is a prerequisite for induction of alpha-ENaC expression. Submandibular gland epithelial (SMG-C6) cells treated with DbcAMP (1 mM) induced both SGK1 mRNA and protein expression. DbcAMP-stimulated SGK1 mRNA expression was decreased by actinomycin D and mRNA and protein expressions were attenuated by PKA inhibitors (H-89 and KT5720). Inhibition of PI3-K with either LY294002 or dominant negative PI3-K reduced DbcAMP-stimulated SGK1 protein and mRNA levels, attenuated the phosphorylation of CREB (a cAMP-activated transcription factor) and decreased alpha-ENaC protein levels and Na(+) transport. In addition, the combination of PKA inhibitors with dominant negative PI3-K synergistically inhibited DbcAMP-induced Na(+) transport. Inhibition of SGK1 expression by siRNA decreased but did not obliterate DbcAMP-induced alpha-ENaC expression. Thus, in a cell line which endogenously exhibits minimal alpha-ENaC expression, induction of SGK1 by DbcAMP occurs via the PI3-K and PKA pathways. Increased alpha-ENaC levels and function are partly dependent upon the early induction of SGK1 expressio.
secreted glycoproteins that control diverse biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We here found that Wnt5a inhibited apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in primary-cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Anti-apoptotic activity of Wnt5a was not inhibited by a dickkopf-1 (DKK), which blocks the canonical Wnt pathway. On the other hand, loss of function of protein kinase A (PKA), induced by treatment with PKA inhibitors, siRNA-mediated knocking down of endogenous PKA catalytic subunits, or enforced expression of dominant-negative PKA inhibited the Wnt5a anti-apoptotic activity, indicating the involvement of PKA in the Wnt5a anti-apoptotic activity. In agreement, phosphorylation levels of a cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a representative downstream effector of PKA, the activation of which is known to lead to the pro-survival effects, was elevated by Wnt5a. In addition, Wnt5a increased the nuclear beta-catenin level and treatment with imatinib or ionomycin, either of which blocks the beta-catenin pathway, reduced the anti-apoptotic activity of Wnt5a, together suggesting the simultaneous involvement of the beta-catenin-mediated pathway in the Wnt5a anti-apoptotic activity. Based on another finding indicating that Wnt5a upregulated PKA-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) at serine 9 that caused inactivation of GSK-3beta and subsequently resulted in activation of the beta-catenin pathway, we have speculated that the Wnt5a anti-apoptotic activity may be partially mediated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and subsequent activation of the beta-catenin pathwa.
ular mechanism of the action of lithium salts in the treatment of bipolar disorder is not well understood. As their therapeutic action requires chronic treatment, adaptive neuronal processes are suggested to be involved. The molecular basis of this are changes in gene expression regulated by transcription factors such as CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein). CREB contains a transactivation domain, in which Ser119 is phosphorylated upon activation, and a bZip (basic leucine zipper domain). The bZip is involved in CREB dimerization and DNA-binding, but also contributes to CREB transactivation by recruiting the coactivator TORC (transducer of regulated CREB). In the present study, the effect of lithium on CRE (cAMP response element)/CREB-directed gene transcription was investigated. Electrically excitable cells were transfected with CRE/CREB-driven luciferase reporter genes. LiCl (6 mM or higher) induced an up to 4.7-fold increase in 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated CRE/CREB-directed transcription. This increase was not due to enhanced Ser119 phosphorylation or DNA-binding of CREB. Also, the known targets inositol monophosphatase and GSK3beta (glycogen-synthase-kinase 3beta) were not involved as specific GSK3beta inhibitors and inositol replenishment did not mimic and abolish respectively the effect of lithium. However, lithium no longer enhanced CREB activity when the CREB-bZip was deleted or the TORC-binding site inside the CREB-bZip was specifically mutated (CREB-R300A). Otherwise, TORC overexpression conferred lithium responsiveness on CREB-bZip or the CRE-containing truncated rat somatostatin promoter. This indicates that lithium enhances cAMP-induced CRE/CREB-directed transcription, conferred by TORC on the CREB-bZip. We thus support the hypothesis that lithium salts modulate CRE/CREB-dependent gene transcription and suggest the CREB coactivator TORC as a new molecular target of lithiu.
 mouse Langendorff heart perfusion model, the signaling pathways that regulate cardiac CREB-S133 phosphorylation have been defined. In mouse hearts stimulated with isoproterenol (ISO) (10(-8) M), endothelin-1 (ET-1) (10(-8) M), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) (10(-7) M), CREB-S133 phosphorylation was attained only by TPA-treatment. Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) was achieved by ISO. ISO- and ET-1-stimulation activated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Protein kinase C (PKC) and p90(RSK) were activated with all three stimuli. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with PD98059 (10(-5) M) completely inhibited the activation of p90(RSK), but did not block CREB-S133 phosphorylation in TPA-perfused heart, indicating that PKA, CaMKII, and p90(RSK) do not phosphorylate CREB-S133 in the murine heart. PKC activation is signal specific. Analyses of PKC isoforms suggest that CREB phosphorylation is mediated by PKC epsilon translocating into nucleus only with TPA stimulation. These results, unlike those reported in other tissues, demonstrate that cardiac CREB is not a multi-signal targe.
f the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily function as key transcriptional regulators of inflammation and proliferation in cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the ligand-dependent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptors, this family of transcription factors includes a large number of orphan receptors, and their role in vascular diseases remains to be investigated. The neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR1) belongs to the ligand-independent NR4A subfamily, which has been implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate NOR1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) of human atherosclerotic lesions. In response to mitogenic stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), SMC rapidly express NOR1 through an ERK-MAPK-dependent signaling pathway. 5'-deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and transactivation experiments demonstrate that PDGF-induced NOR1 expression is mediated through a cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent transactivation of the NOR1 promoter. Consequently, short interfering RNA-mediated depletion of CREB abolished PDGF-induced NOR1 expression in SMC. Furthermore, PDGF induced Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB and subsequent binding to the CRE sites of the endogenous NOR1 promoter. Functional analysis demonstrated that PDGF induces NOR1 transactivation of its consensus NGFI-B-response elements (NBRE) in SMC. We finally demonstrate that SMC isolated from NOR1-deficient mice exhibit decreased cell proliferation and characterize cyclin D1 and D2 as NOR1 target genes in SMC. These experiments indicate that PDGF-induced NOR1 transcription in SMC is mediated through CREB-dependent transactivation of the NOR1 promoter and further demonstrate that NOR1 functions as a key transcriptional regulator of SMC proliferatio.
d acoustic trauma by applying click stimuli of 130 dB (SPL) for 30 min to one ear of adult rats. This treatment resulted in an instant and permanent threshold shift of 96 dB in the affected ear. A massive reduction of cochlear nerve fibers in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) was demonstrated by tracing them from the cochlea of rats that survived acoustic overstimulation for 1 year or longer. In the auditory brainstem, we observed a deprivation-dependent appearance of fibers positive for tyrosine receptor kinase B in the ipsilateral VCN between day 3 and day 21 after trauma and an increase in phosphoserine immunostaining in the neuropil of the ipsilateral VCN and in neurons of the contralateral lateral superior olive during the first 30 days after trauma. Immunoreactivity for the cAMP response element binding protein in its phosphorylated form was transiently depressed in the ipsilateral inferior colliculus immediately after trauma and was elevated as late as 7 months after trauma in the ipsilateral VCN. Apparently, a unilateral acoustic overstimulation entails specific regulations of the activity of plasticity-associated molecules through phosphorylation and includes changes to neurotrophin signaling between neurons of the auditory brainste.
ne is an indirect dopamine receptor agonist and increases glutamate release in the striatum. Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) upregulates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and Elk-1 phosphorylation via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the striatum in vivo. In the present study the role of mGluRs in the regulation of ERK1/2 pathways leading to CREB and Elk-1 phosphorylation by amphetamine was investigated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot in the rat dorsal striatum. Acute administration of amphetamine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) caused increases in phosphorylated (p)CREB, pElk-1, and pERK1/2 immunoreactivity. Intrastriatal blockade of group I mGluRs with N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC; 25 nmol) significantly attenuated amphetamine-induced pCREB, pElk-1, pERK1/2, and Fos immunoreactivity in both medial and lateral areas of the striatum. Systemic injection of an mGluR5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP; 10 mg/kg, i.p.), also blocked the amphetamine induction of these phosphoproteins. In contrast, intrastriatal blockade of group II/III mGluRs with (RS)-alpha-methylserine-o-phosphate monophenyl ester (MSOPPE; 25 nmol) did not affect amphetamine-induced increases in all the four markers. Similarly, intrastriatal dantrolene (2 or 20 nmol) that blocks intracellular Ca(2+) release from ryanodine-sensitive stores did not affect amphetamine effects. Injection of PHCCC, MPEP, MSOPPE, or dantrolene alone did not alter basal levels of the three phosphoproteins and Fos. These data suggest that acute amphetamine is able to facilitate the phosphorylation of CREB, Elk-1, and ERK1/2 signaling proteins and Fos gene expression via a group I mGluR-dependent mechanism in the dorsal striatu.
hosphorylations are known to occur in the N-terminal transactivation domain of human p53. To explore the structural effects of these phosphorylations, we have chemically synthesized the unphosphorylated p53-(1-39) and its three phosphorylated analogs, phosphorylated at Ser-15, Thr-18, and Ser-20. p53-(1-39) and its Ser-15 and Thr-18 phosphorylated analogs were tested for interaction with p300. The order of binding affinities was similar to that derived from biochemical experiments with the whole protein, indicating functional integrity of the domain. Differences in chemical shifts and coupling constants indicate significant structural changes upon phosphorylations. The single tryptophan in the unphosphorylated domain has an emission maximum and a Stern-Volmer constant that are characteristics of tryptophans situated in protein interiors. The diffusion constant is monomer-like, with an axial ratio of 1:7.5, indicating a significant degree of compaction. Upon phosphorylations, the emission maximum and diffusion constant change significantly toward values that indicate more open conformations. Binding of the hydrophobic probe bis-1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate to the unphosphorylated and one of the phosphorylated domains is also significantly different, suggesting different conformations. We propose that phosphorylations switch the largely folded transactivation domain to more open conformations that interact with transcription factors such as p300/cAMP- responsive element-binding protein-binding protein, leading to enhancement of gene expressio.
from the adrenal medulla, angiotensin II (AII) regulates both the activity and mRNA levels of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes whose expression is thought to be under the control of cAMP-responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB). In this study, we evaluated the effect of AII stimulation on CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 (pCREB) in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (BACC). We found that AII produces a rapid and AII type-1 receptor (AT1)-dependent increase in pCREB levels, which is blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 but not by H-89, SB203580 or KN-93, suggesting that it is mediated by the extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) or Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) dependent pathways. Gel-shift experiments showed that the increase in pCREB levels is accompanied by an ERK1/2-dependent upregulation of CRE-binding activity. We also found that AII promotes a rapid and reversible increase in the activity of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src and that the inhibition of this enzyme completely blocks the AII-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, the CREB kinase (p90)RSK and CREB. Our data support the hypothesis that in BACC, AII upregulates CREB functionality through a mechanism that requires Src-mediated activation of ERK 1/2 and (p90)RS.
P response element-binding protein (CREB) is a major transcriptional activator at the calcium and cAMP response-element (CaCRE). Phosphorylated (p)CREB facilitates gene expression in striatal neurons. Elk-1 is another transcriptional regulator at the serum response element in the upstream promoter region of the CaCRE. Elk-1 is phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and may also contribute to the regulation of gene expression. To evaluate putative roles of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in CREB, Elk-1, and ERK phosphorylation, the group I selective agonist, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), was infused into the dorsal striatum at doses of 125, 250, or 500 nmol in freely moving rats. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry demonstrated that DHPG significantly increased levels of pCREB, pElk-1, and pERK immunoreactivity of ipsilateral dorsal striatum in a dose dependent manner. The increased immunoreactivity by 500 nmol DHPG was significantly blocked by intrastriatal infusion of the group I selective antagonist, n-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC, 25 nmol), but not by the group II/III antagonist, (RS)-alpha-methylserine-o-phosphate monophenyl ester (MSOPPE, 25 nmol). These data suggest that group I mGluR activation is positively linked to signaling cascades resulting in CREB, Elk-1, and ERK phosphorylation in the striatum in viv.
P response element binding protein (CREB) is involved in activation of transcriptional DNA machinery by binding to the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). The interactions between CREB serine phosphate (pSer133) and specific CBP residues (Tyr658 and Lys662) play a crucial role for the thermodynamic stability of the CREB-CBP complex. Here we use ab initio methods to investigate the dynamics and energetics of a relatively large, fully hydrated model complex representing pSer133 and its counterparts of the CBP domain. The calculations suggest that: (1) key contributions to the stabilization of the complex arise not only from electrostatics (as previously proposed) but also from a previously unrecognized &quot;low-barrier hydrogen bond&quot; between pSer133 and Lys662; (2) hydration plays a crucial role for the stabilization of the phosphate charge; (3) formation of the complex involves a significant degree of reorganization of the electronic charge densit.
ion of low concentrations (0.1-1 nM) of extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein to PC12 neuronal cells stimulated a rapid (peak at 5 min) elevation of the cAMP intracellular levels, which in turn induced the phosphorylation of CREB transcription factor (peak at 15 min) on serine-133 (Ser-133). On the contrary, at later time points (60-120 min) Tat induced a significant decline of intracellular cAMP with respect to the basal levels observed in control cells treated with bovine serum albumin. In blocking experiments performed with pharmacological inhibitors, Tat decreased the intracellular levels of cAMP and CREB Ser-133 phosphorylation through a signal transduction pathway involving the sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT, and cyclic nucleoside phosphodiesterases. Moreover, in transient transfection experiments, Tat inhibited transcription of CREB promoter in a manner strictly dependent on the presence of the cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) in the CREB promoter. Consistently, the expression of endogenous CREB protein was significantly reduced in PC12 cells by prolonged (24-48 h) treatment with Tat. This decline in the expression of CREB, which plays an essential role in the survival and function of neuronal cells, anticipated a progressive increase of apoptosis in Tat-treated cells. Although obtained in a neuronal cell line, our findings might help to explain some aspects of the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementi.
le receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) is shown to mitigate pro-inflammatory effects triggered by ligation of RAGE with N(ε)-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML)-AGE or other ligands. We examined the associations among host, lifestyle, and genetic determinants of CML-AGE or sRAGE and risk of pancreatic cancer in the prospective ATBC Study. We obtained baseline exposure information, data on serological and genetic biomarkers from 141 patients with pancreatic cancer and 141 subcohort controls. Stepwise linear and logistic regression models were used for data analysis. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that CML-AGE concentrations were independently inversely correlated with the minor allele of rs640742 of DDOST, physical activity, alcohol consumption, diastolic blood pressure (BP), and positively correlated with heart rate, serum sRAGE and HDL concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). sRAGE concentrations were independently inversely correlated with the 82Ser allele of rs2070600 of RAGE, age, body mass index, heart rate, and serum HDL; and positively correlated with serum CML-AGE, sucrose consumption, and diastolic BP (P &lt; 0.05). The minor allele of rs1035786 of RAGE was associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (any T compared with CC: multivariate OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98). We identified host metabolic profile, lifestyle and genetic factors that explained approximately 50% of variability of CML-AGE or sRAGE in Finnish men smokers. The association between RAGE SNPs and pancreatic cancer risk warrants further investigatio.

olic levels of energy and substance including lipid, protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and trace element were obviously reduced in patients of PDS, which might be an important pathogenesis mechanism for its occurrenc.
f the PP1 family of protein phosphatases achieve functional diversity through numerous and varied protein-protein interactions. In mammals, there are four PP1 isoforms, the ubiquitously expressed PPP1CA, PPP1CB, and PPP1CC1, and the testis specific splice isoform PPP1CC2. When the mouse Ppp1cc gene is deleted, the only phenotypic consequence is a failure of spermatogenesis in homozygous males. To elucidate the function of the Ppp1cc gene, we sought to identify novel protein-protein interactions. To this end, we have created SBP-3XFLAG-PPP1CC1 and SBP-3XFLAG-PPP1CC2 knock-in mouse embryonic stem cell lines using a gene-trap-based system. Tandem affinity purification using our knock-in cell lines identified 11 significant protein-protein interactions, including nine known PP1 interacting proteins and two additional proteins (ATP5C1 and DDOST). Reciprocal in vitro sedimentation assays confirmed the interaction between PPP1CC2 and DDOST that may have physiological implications in spermatogenesis. Immunolocalization studies revealed that DDOST localized to the nuclear envelope in dissociated spermatogenic cells and persists throughout spermatogenesis. The knock-in system described in this paper can be applied in creating tandem affinity-tagged knock-in embryonic stem cell lines with any gene for which a compatible gene-trap line is availabl.
l disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are inherited autosomal-recessive diseases that impair N-glycosylation. Approximately 20% of patients do not survive beyond the age of 5 years old as a result of widespread organ dysfunction. Although most patients receive a CDG diagnosis based on abnormal glycosylation of transferrin, this test cannot provide a genetic diagnosis; indeed, many patients with abnormal transferrin do not have mutations in any known CDG genes. Here, we combined biochemical analysis with whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify the genetic defect in an untyped CDG patient, and we found a 22 bp deletion and a missense mutation in DDOST, whose product is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex that transfers the glycan chain from a lipid carrier to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Biochemical analysis with three biomarkers revealed that N-glycosylation was decreased in the patient's fibroblasts. Complementation with wild-type-DDOST cDNA in patient fibroblasts restored glycosylation, indicating that the mutations were pathological. Our results highlight the power of combining WES and biochemical studies, including a glyco-complementation system, for identifying and confirming the defective gene in an untyped CDG patient. This approach will be very useful for uncovering other types of CDG as wel.
glycation end products (AGE) have recently been implicated in aging changes within different tissues of the body. The role of AGEs and their receptors in the mammalian inner ear is largely unknown. In this study we analyzed for the expression of two AGE receptors, namely RAGE and Ddost (AGE-R1.

eceptors RAGE and Ddost (AGE-R1) could be identified within the cochlea. Different expression patterns of these two receptors were observed in the immature and mature inner ea.
eceptors 1, 2 and 3, which are encoded by DDOST, PRKCSH and LGALS3, respectively, may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. We sought to find out whether these genes are associated with diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease and type 1 diabetes or related quantitative trait.
 Tagger program, we selected 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on the HapMap Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme (Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry) data. The SNPs were genotyped in 2,719 Finnish patients with type 1 diabetes and tested for association with diabetic nephropathy (821 cases, 1,060 controls), cardiovascular disease and related quantitative traits. For association analysis with type 1 diabetes, 703 non-diabetic control participants were genotype.

However, these associations did not reach the significance limit of 0.0008 adjusted for multiple testing. None of the DDOST, PRKCSH or LGALS3 SNPs were associated with quantitative traits related to diabetic nephropathy, including AER and estimated GFR. No associations were found between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease, blood pressure, serum lipid levels or type 1 diabete.

 PINK1 gene mutations are involved in recessive early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). In order to determine the causative mutations in three affected sibs from a consanguineous Sudanese family with EOPD, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed and revealed that the patients were homozygous for a deletion of PINK1 exons 4 to 8. Breakpoint analysis revealed a complex rearrangement combining a large deletion and the insertion of a sequence duplicated from the DDOST gene intron 2, located near the PINK1 gene. As breakpoint sequences displayed only three base pairs of homology, this rearrangement may result from Fork Stalling and Template Switching mechanism. This third large rearrangement of PINK1 enlarges the mutation spectrum and, together with recent published data in Tunisian patients with EOPD, points out that PINK1 gene analysis, including search for large rearrangement, should be considered in early onset recessive PD patients, particularly those from Arab origi.
he common use of immunohistochemistry in autopsy tissues, the stability of most proteins over extended time periods is unknown. The robustness of signal for 16 proteins (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, AGER, MSR, SCARB1, OLR1, CD36, LTF, LGALS3, LYZ, and DDOST) and two measures of advanced glycation end products (AGE, CML) was evaluated. Two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue arrays containing 16 tissues each were created to evaluate 48 hr of autolysis in a warm or cold environment. For these classes of proteins, matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, scavenger receptors, and advanced glycation end product receptors, we saw no systematic diminution of signal intensity during a period of 24 hr. Analysis was performed by two independent observers and confirmed for a subset of proteins by digital analysis and Western blotting. We conclude that these classes of proteins degrade slowly and faithfully maintain their immunohistochemistry characteristics over at least a 24-hr time interval in devitalized tissues. This study supports the use of autopsy tissues with short postmortem intervals for immunohistochemical studies for diseases such as diabetic vascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and other pathological states.

e oligosaccharyltransferase (dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase; EC 2. 4.1.119) (DDOST) catalyzes the transfer of a high-mannose oligosaccharide (GlcNac2Man9Glc3) from a dolichol-linked oligosaccharide donor (dolichol-P-GlcNac2Man9Glc3) onto the asparagine acceptor site within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. We isolated mouse and human DDOST cDNAs from retinoic acid-treated mouse P19 EC cells and human NT-2 cells, respectively. DDOST mRNA is expressed intensely in heart and pancreas, but at lower levels in brain. Here we show that the human DDOST 48-kDa subunit gene (HGMW-approved symbol DDOST) is organized into 11 exons expanding about 9 kb. This DDOST subunit gene is localized on chromosome 1p36.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysi.
ndrome is a rare genetic syndrome characterised by a unique combination of multiple organ anomalies. Dominant loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7), which is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller, have been identified as the cause of CHARGE syndrome. Here, we review recent work aimed at understanding the mechanism of CHD7 function in normal and pathological states, highlighting results from biochemical and in vivo studies. The emerging picture from this work suggests that the mechanisms by which CHD7 fine-tunes gene expression are context specific, consistent with the pleiotropic nature of CHARGE syndrom.
ndrome is caused by spontaneous loss-of-function mutations to the ATP-dependant chromatin remodeller chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). It is characterised by a distinct pattern of congenital anomalies, including cardiovascular malformations. Disruption to the neural crest lineage has previously been emphasised in the aetiology of this developmental disorder. We present evidence for an additional requirement for CHD7 activity in the Mesp1-expressing anterior mesoderm during heart development. Conditional ablation of Chd7 in this lineage results in major structural cardiovascular defects akin to those seen in CHARGE patients, as well as a striking loss of cardiac innervation and embryonic lethality. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis identified aberrant expression of key components of the Class 3 Semaphorin and Slit-Robo signalling pathways in Chd7(fl/fl);Mesp1-Cre mutant hearts. CHD7 localises at the Sema3c promoter in vivo, with alteration of the local chromatin structure seen following Chd7 ablation, suggestive of direct transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we uncover a novel role for CHD7 activity upstream of critical calcium handling genes, and demonstrate an associated functional defect in the ability of cardiomyocytes to undergo excitation-contraction coupling. This work therefore reveals the importance of CHD7 in the cardiogenic mesoderm for multiple processes during cardiovascular developmen.
ndrome MIM #214800 is an autosomal dominant syndrome involving multiple congenital malformations. Clinical symptoms include coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retardation of growth or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies or deafness. Mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene have been found in 65-70% of CHARGE syndrome patients. Here, we describe a 16-month-old boy with typical CHARGE syndrome, who was referred for CHD7 gene analysis. Sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed. A heterozygous 38,304-bp deletion encompassing exon 3 with a 4-bp insertion was identified. There were no Alu sequences adjacent to the breakpoints, and no sequence microhomology was observed at the junction. Therefore, this large deletion may have been mediated by non-homologous end joining. The mechanism of the deletion in the current case differs from the previously suggested mechanisms underlying large deletions or complex genomic rearrangements in the CHD7 gene, and this is the first report of CHD7 deletion by this mechanism worldwid.
ing mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) cause CHARGE syndrome, a severe multiorgan system disorder of which Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is a minor feature. Recent reports have described predominantly missense CHD7 alleles in IGD patients, but it is unclear if these alleles are relevant to causality or overall genetic burden of Kallmann syndrome (KS) and normosmic form of IGD. To address this question, we sequenced CHD7 in 783 well-phenotyped IGD patients lacking full CHARGE features; we identified nonsynonymous rare sequence variants in 5.2% of the IGD cohort (73% missense and 27% splice variants). Functional analyses in zebrafish using a surrogate otolith assay of a representative set of these CHD7 alleles showed that rare sequence variants observed in controls showed no altered function. In contrast, 75% of the IGD-associated alleles were deleterious and resulted in both KS and normosmic IGD. In two families, pathogenic mutations in CHD7 coexisted with mutations in other known IGD genes. Taken together, our data suggest that rare deleterious CHD7 alleles contribute to the mutational burden of patients with both KS and normosmic forms of IGD in the absence of full CHARGE syndrome. These findings (i) implicate a unique role or preferential sensitivity for CHD7 in the ontogeny of GnRH neurons, (ii) reiterate the emerging genetic complexity of this family of IGD disorders, and (iii) demonstrate how the coordinated use of well-phenotyped cohorts, families, and functional studies can inform genetic architecture and provide insights into the developmental biology of cellular system.
em/progenitor cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus produce new neurons throughout adult life. NSCs are maintained in a state of reversible quiescence and the failure to maintain the quiescent state can result in the premature depletion of the stem cell pool. The epigenetic mechanisms that maintain this quiescent state have not been identified. Using an inducible knockout mouse model, we show that the chromatin remodeling factor chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) is essential for maintaining NSC quiescence. CHD7 inactivation in adult NSCs results in a loss of stem cell quiescence in the hippocampus, a transient increase in cell divisions, followed by a significant decline in neurogenesis. This loss of NSC quiescence is associated with the premature loss of NSCs in middle-aged mice. We find that CHD7 represses the transcription of several positive regulators of cell cycle progression and is required for full induction of the Notch target gene Hes5 in quiescent NSCs. These findings directly link CHD7 to pathways involved in NSC quiescence and identify the first chromatin-remodeling factor with a role in NSC quiescence and maintenance. As CHD7 haplo-insufficiency is associated with a range of cognitive disabilities in CHARGE syndrome, our observations may have implications for understanding the basis of these deficit.
ndrome is a rare human disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7). Characteristics of CHARGE are varied and include developmental ear and hearing anomalies. Here we report a novel mouse model of CHD7 dysfunction, termed Looper. The Looper strain harbours a nonsense mutation (c.5690C&gt;A, p.S1897X) within the Chd7 gene. Looper mice exhibit many of the clinical features of the human syndrome, consistent with previously reported CHARGE models, including growth retardation, facial asymmetry, vestibular defects, eye anomalies, hyperactivity, ossicle malformation, hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Looper mice display an otosclerosis-like fusion of the stapes footplate to the cochlear oval window and blepharoconjunctivitis but not coloboma. Looper mice are hyperactive and have vestibular dysfunction but do not display motor impairmen.
ed roles of two chromatin remodelers, Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) and SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable-B (SWI/SNF-B), and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)/Wnt signaling in the maintenance of the multipotency of mouse trunk neural crest cells, leading to the formation of mouse neural crest-derived stem cells (mouse NCSCs). CHD7 was expressed in the undifferentiated neural crest cells and in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and sciatic nerve, typical tissues containing NCSCs. BMP/Wnt signaling stimulated the expression of CHD7 and participated in maintaining the multipotency of neural crest cells. Furthermore, the promotion of CHD7 expression maintained the multipotency of these cells. The inhibition of CHD7 and SWI/SNF-B expression significantly suppressed the maintenance of the multipotency of these cells. In addition, BMP/Wnt treatment promoted CHD7 expression and caused the increase of the percentage of multipotent cells in DRG. Thus, the present data suggest that the chromatin remodelers as well as BMP/Wnt signaling play essential roles in the maintenance of the multipotency of mouse trunk neural crest cells and in the formation of mouse NCSC.
ndrome is a congenital disorder caused by mutation of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene and is characterized by multiple anomalies including ocular coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital and/or urological abnormalities, ear anomalies, and hearing loss. In the present study, 76% of subjects had some type of endocrine disorder: short stature (72%), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (60%), hypothyroidism (16%), and combined hypopituitarism (8%). A mutation in CHD7 was found in 80% of subjects. Here, we report the phenotypic spectrum of 25 Japanese patients with CHARGE syndrome, including their endocrinological feature.
ous loss of function mutations in CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) lead to CHARGE syndrome, a complex developmental disorder affecting craniofacial structures, cranial nerves and several organ systems. Recently, it was demonstrated that CHD7 is essential for the formation of multipotent migratory neural crest cells, which migrate from the neural tube to many regions of the embryo, where they differentiate into various tissues including craniofacial and heart structures. So far, only few CHD7 target genes involved in neural crest cell development have been identified and the role of CHD7 in neural crest cell guidance and the regulation of mesenchymal-epithelial transition are unknown. Therefore, we undertook a genome-wide microarray expression analysis on wild-type and CHD7 deficient (Chd7 (Whi/+) and Chd7 (Whi/Whi)) mouse embryos at day 9.5, a time point of neural crest cell migration. We identified 98 differentially expressed genes between wild-type and Chd7 (Whi/Whi) embryos. Interestingly, many misregulated genes are involved in neural crest cell and axon guidance such as semaphorins and ephrin receptors. By performing knockdown experiments for Chd7 in Xenopus laevis embryos, we found abnormalities in the expression pattern of Sema3a, a protein involved in the pathogenesis of Kallmann syndrome, in vivo. In addition, we detected non-synonymous SEMA3A variations in 3 out of 45 CHD7-negative CHARGE patients. In summary, we discovered for the first time that Chd7 regulates genes involved in neural crest cell guidance, demonstrating a new aspect in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome. Furthermore, we showed for Sema3a a conserved regulatory mechanism across different species, highlighting its significance during development. Although we postulated that the non-synonymous SEMA3A variants which we found in CHD7-negative CHARGE patients alone are not sufficient to produce the phenotype, we suggest an important modifier role for SEMA3A in the pathogenesis of this multiple malformation syndrom.
ndrome has been estimated to occur in 1:10,000 births worldwide and shows various clinical manifestations. It is a genetic disorder characterized by a specific and a recognizable pattern of anomalies. The major clinical features are ocular coloboma, heart malformations, atresia of the choanae, growth retardation, genital hypoplasia, and ear abnormalities. The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene, located on chromosome 8q12.1, causes CHARGE syndrome. The CHD7 protein is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin remodeling protein. A total of 67% of patients clinically diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome have CHD7 mutations. Five hundred twenty-eight pathogenic and unique CHD7 alterations have been identified so far. We describe a patient with a CHARGE syndrome diagnosis who carried a novel de novo mutation, a c.3896T&gt;C (p. leu1299Pro) missense mutation, in the CHD7 gene. This finding will provide more information for genetic counseling and expand our understanding of the pathogenesis and development of CHARGE syndrom.
ndrome is a sporadic autosomal-dominant genetic disorder characterized by a complex array of birth defects so named for its cardinal features of ocular coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities. Approximately two-thirds of individuals clinically diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome have heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. To examine the role of Chd7 in development, a zebrafish model was generated through morpholino (MO)-mediated targeting of the zebrafish chd7 transcript. High doses of chd7 MO induce lethality early in embryonic development. However, low dose-injected embryos are viable, and by 4 days post-fertilization, morphant fish display multiple defects in organ systems analogous to those affected in humans with CHARGE syndrome. The chd7 morphants show elevated expression of several potent cell-cycle inhibitors including ink4ab (p16/p15), p21 and p27, accompanied by reduced cell proliferation. We also show that Chd7 is required for proper organization of neural crest-derived craniofacial cartilage structures. Strikingly, MO-mediated knockdown of the jumonji domain-containing histone demethylase fbxl10/kdm2bb, a repressor of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, rescues cell proliferation and cartilage defects in chd7 morphant embryos and can lead to complete rescue of the CHARGE syndrome phenotype. These results indicate that CHARGE-like phenotypes in zebrafish can be mitigated through modulation of fbxl10 levels and implicate FBXL10 as a possible therapeutic target in CHARGE syndrom.
 factors that regulate neurogenesis in the&nbsp;central nervous system remain to be explored. Here, we demonstrate that the chromatin remodeler&nbsp;chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), a protein frequently mutated in human CHARGE syndrome, is a master regulator of neurogenesis in mammalian brain. CHD7 is selectively expressed in actively dividing neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitors. Genetic inactivation of CHD7 in NSCs leads to a reduction of neuronal differentiation and aberrant dendritic development of newborn neurons. Strikingly, physical exercise can rescue the CHD7 mutant phenotype in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus. We further show that in NSCs, CHD7 stimulates the expression of Sox4 and Sox11 genes via remodeling their promoters to an open chromatin state. Our study demonstrates an essential role of CHD7 in activation of the neuronal differentiation program in NSCs, thus providing insights into epigenetic regulation of stem cell differentiation and molecular mechanism of human CHARGE syndrom.
nt of the cerebral vessels, pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs). and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) requires multipotent neural crest cells (NCCs) that migrate from the neural tube to target tissue destinations. Little is known about how mammalian NCC development is orchestrated by gene programming at the chromatin level, however. Here we show that Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), an ATPase subunit of the Brg1/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is required in NCCs to direct cardiovascular development. Mouse embryos lacking Brg1 in NCCs display immature cerebral vessels, aberrant PAA patterning, and shortened OFT. Brg1 suppresses an apoptosis factor, Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and a cell cycle inhibitor, p21(cip1), to inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation of NCCs, thereby maintaining a multipotent cell reservoir at the neural crest. Brg1 also supports Myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11) expression to allow NCCs to develop into mature vascular smooth muscle cells of cerebral vessels. Within NCCs, Brg1 partners with chromatin remodeler Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7) on the PlexinA2 promoter to activate PlexinA2, which encodes a receptor for semaphorin to guide NCCs into the OFT. Our findings reveal an important role for Brg1 and its downstream pathways in the survival, differentiation, and migration of the multipotent NCCs critical for mammalian cardiovascular developmen.
 in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 gene (CHD7) lead to CHARGE syndrome, an autosomal dominant multiple malformation disorder. Proteins involved in chromatin remodeling typically act in multiprotein complexes. We previously demonstrated that a part of human CHD7 interacts with a part of human CHD8, another chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein presumably being involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental (NDD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because identification of novel CHD7 and CHD8 interacting partners will provide further insights into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and ASD/NDD, we searched for additional associated polypeptides using the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometr.
rto uncharacterized FAM124B (Family with sequence similarity 124B) was identified as a potential interaction partner of both CHD7 and CHD8. We confirmed the result by co-immunoprecipitation studies and showed a direct binding to the CHD8 part by direct yeast two hybrid experiments. Furthermore, we characterized FAM124B as a mainly nuclear localized protein with a widespread expression in embryonic and adult mouse tissue.
ts demonstrate that FAM124B is a potential interacting partner of a CHD7 and CHD8 containing complex. From the overlapping expression pattern between Chd7 and Fam124B at murine embryonic day E12.5 and the high expression of Fam124B in the developing mouse brain, we conclude that Fam124B is a novel protein possibly involved in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorder.
ndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by a specific and recognizable pattern of anomalies. De novo mutations or deletions of the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7) are the major cause of CHARGE syndrome. In this report, we describe a patient with a typical phenotype characterized by psychomotor retardation, hypertrichosis, facial asymmetry, synophria, failure to thrive, developmental delay and gastro-esophageal reflux, carrying a de novo 6.04Mb interstitial deletion in 8q12.1q12.3 detected by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Despite the deletion includes CHD7 and although the patient shares some of the clinical features of the CHARGE syndrome, she does not fulfill the clinical criteria for this syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case with an entire deletion of the CHD7 gene not leading to CHARGE syndrome and, for this reason, useful to expand and further delineate the clinical features associated with the 8q12.1q12.3 deletion. Furthermore, the literature review revealed that the phenotype secondary to duplications of the same region partially overlaps with the phenotype reported in this study. Selected genes that are present in the hemizygous state and which might be important for the phenotype of this patient, are discussed in context of the clinical feature.
ne of the nine members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. Mutations in CHD7 give rise to CHARGE syndrome, a human condition characterized by malformation of various organs. We have now identified a novel transcript of CHD7 that is generated by alternative splicing of exon 6. The protein encoded by this variant transcript (termed CHD7S) lacks one of the two chromodomains as well as the helicase/ATPase domain, DNA-binding domain and BRK domains of the full-length protein (CHD7L). CHD7S was found to localize specifically to the nucleolus in a manner dependent on a nucleolar localization signal. Over-expression of CHD7S, as well as that of CHD7L, resulted in an increase in 45S precursor rRNA production. Conversely, depletion of both CHD7S and CHD7L by RNA interference inhibited both 45S precursor rRNA production and cell proliferation to a greater extent than did depletion of CHD7L alone. Furthermore, we found that, like CHD7L, CHD7S binds to Sox2 in the nucleoplasm. Unexpectedly, however, whereas over-expression of CHD7L promoted Sox2-mediated transcriptional regulation, over-expression of CHD7S suppressed it. These results indicate that CHD7S functions cooperatively or antagonistically with CHD7L in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, respectivel.
oloboma of the eye, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia and ear anomalies and/or hearing loss) syndrome is a rare genetic, multiple-malformation syndrome. About 80% of patients with a clinical diagnose, have a mutation or a deletion in the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). Genotype-phenotype correlation is only partly known. In this nationwide study, phenotypic characteristics of 18 Danish CHD7 mutation positive CHARGE individuals (N = 18) are presented. We studied patient records, clinical photographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Information was not available for all traits in all subjects. Therefore, the results are presented as fractions. The following prevalence of cardinal symptoms were found: coloboma, 16/17; heart defects, 14/18; choanal atresia, 7/17; retarded growth and development, 11/13; genital abnormalities, 5/18; ear anomalies, 15/17 and sensorineural hearing loss, 14/15. Vestibular dysfunction (10/13) and swallowing problems (12/15) were other frequent cranial nerve dysfunctions. Three-dimensional reconstructions of MRI scans showed temporal bone abnormalities in &gt;85%. CHARGE syndrome present a broad phenotypic spectrum, although some clinical features are more frequently occurring than others. Here, we suggest that genetic testing for CHD7 mutation should be considered in neonates with a specific combination of several clinical symptom.
loboma, heart malformation, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies associated with deafness (CHARGE) syndrome is a rare, usually sporadic, autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations within the CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) gene, in nearly 70% of cases. Because human CHD7 is relatively large (38 exons encoding a 300-kDa protein), genetic analysis requires cost-effective and time-consuming techniques. Herein, we propose an alternative screening method to quickly detect CHD7 mutations using mainly denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. The entire coding region with exon-intron boundaries was amplified under the same experimental conditions. Each amplicon of the same CHD7 region was subjected to denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, and resulting chromatograms were compared within small series of patients. Because a CHD7 mutation differs generally from one patient to another, corresponding chromatograms exhibited a unique pattern that is significantly different from common polymorphisms. Only amplicons exhibiting a unique profile were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis. Intragenic rearrangements were investigated with only nine multiplex PCRs. In conclusion, using our protocol, we can quickly detect the right containing mutation amplicon and we provide a robust, rapid, and cheaper method to screen CHD7 microrearrangements or an entire deletio.
esis is a complex process during early vertebrate development involving interactions between many factors to form a bilateral somite series. A role for chromatin remodelers in somitogenesis has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we investigate the function of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (chd7) during zebrafish somitogenesis. We show that Chd7 deficiency leads to asymmetric segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), as revealed by expression of the somitogenesis genes, cdx1a, dlc, her7, mespa, and ripply1. Moreover, we show that abrogation of Chd7 results in the loss of asymmetric expression of spaw in the lateral plate mesoderm, which is consistent with more general laterality defects. Based on the observation that insufficient Chd7 leads to left-right asymmetry defects during PSM segmentation, and because CHD7 has been linked to human spinal deformities, we suggest that zebrafish chd7 morphants may be a good in vivo model to examine the pathophysiology of these disease.
 in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein-7 (CHD7) cause CHARGE syndrome, which includes eye coloboma, heart malformations, atresia of the choanae, retardation of growth/development, genital anomalies, and ear abnormalities. CHARGE syndrome is usually sporadic, but is also autosomal dominant. CHD7 encodes a large protein that participates in chromatin remodeling and transcription. Findings from studies of mouse models employing ENU-mutagenesis or gene-trap methods recapitulate human CHARGE syndrome. CHARGE patients may manifest anosmia and/or hypogonadism, features that overlap with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS). Similarly, IHH/KS patients may also display partial CHARGE features. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that IHH/KS represents a milder allelic variant of CHARGE syndrome, which has been supported by the identification of heterozygous CHD7 mutations in both normosmic IHH and KS. Developmental expression within the hypothalamus and the presence of human mutations indicate that CHD7 has an important role in puberty and reproduction. In addition, WDR11 was recently identified by positional cloning; and mutations in were identified in IHH/KS patients, suggesting a role for this gene in normal pubert.
 a multiple congenital anomaly disorder and a common cause of pubertal defects, olfactory dysfunction, growth delays, deaf-blindness, balance disorders and congenital heart malformations. Mutations in CHD7, the gene encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, are present in 60-80% of individuals with the CHARGE syndrome. Mutations in CHD7 have also been reported in the Kallmann syndrome (olfactory dysfunction, delayed puberty and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). CHD7 is a positive regulator of neural stem cell proliferation and olfactory sensory neuron formation in the olfactory epithelium, suggesting that the loss of CHD7 might also disrupt development of other neural populations. Here we report that female Chd7(Gt/+) mice have delays in vaginal opening and estrus onset, and erratic estrus cycles. Chd7(Gt/+) mice also have decreased circulating levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone but apparently normal responsiveness to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and antagonist treatment. GnRH neurons in the adult Chd7(Gt/+) hypothalamus and embryonic nasal region are diminished, and there is decreased cellular proliferation in the embryonic olfactory placode. Expression levels of GnRH1 and Otx2 in the hypothalamus and GnRHR in the pituitary are significantly reduced in adult Chd7(Gt/+) mice. Additionally, Chd7 mutant embryos have CHD7 dosage-dependent reductions in expression levels of Fgfr1, Bmp4 and Otx2 in the olfactory placode. Together, these data suggest that CHD7 has critical roles in the development and maintenance of GnRH neurons for regulating puberty and reproductio.
ndrome is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by mutation in the CHD7 gene, encoding chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7. Molecular diagnostic testing for CHD7 mutation has been available in a clinical setting since 2005. We report here the results from the first 642 unrelated proband samples submitted for testing. Thirty-two percent (n = 203) of patient samples had a heterozygous pathogenic variant identified. The lower mutation rate than that published for well-characterized clinical samples is likely due to referral bias, as samples submitted for clinical testing may be for &quot;rule-out&quot; diagnoses, rather than solely to confirm clinical suspicion. We identified 159 unique pathogenic mutations, and of these, 134 mutations were each seen in a single individual and 25 mutations were found in two to five individuals (n =69). Of the 203 mutations, only 9 were missense, with 107 nonsense, 69 frameshift, and 15 splice-site mutations likely leading to haploinsufficiency at the cellular level. An additional 72 variations identified in the 642 tested samples (11%) were considered to have unknown clinical significance. Copy number changes (deletion/duplication of the entire gene or one/several exons) were found to account for a very small number of cases (n = 3). This cohort represents the largest CHARGE syndrome sample size to date and is intended to serve as a resource for clinicians, genetic counselors, researchers, and other diagnostic laboratorie.

med WES on 60 families with LGMDs (100 exomes). Data analysis was performed between January 6 and December 19, 2014, using the xBrowse bioinformatics interface (Broad Institute). Patients with LGMD were ascertained retrospectively through the Institute for Neuroscience and Muscle Research Biospecimen Bank between 2006 and 2014. Enrolled patients had been extensively investigated via protein studies and candidate gene sequencing and remained undiagnosed. Patients presented with more than 2 years of muscle weakness and with dystrophic or myopathic changes present in muscle biopsy specimen.
ostic rate of LGMD in Australia and the relative frequencies of the different LGMD subtypes. Our central goals were to improve the genetic diagnosis of LGMD, investigate whether the WES platform provides adequate coverage of known LGMD-related genes, and identify new LGMD-related gene.
 we identified likely pathogenic mutations in known myopathy genes for 27 of 60 families. Twelve families had mutations in known LGMD-related genes. However, 15 families had variants in disease-related genes not typically associated with LGMD, highlighting the clinical overlap between LGMD and other myopathies. Common causes of phenotypic overlap were due to mutations in congenital muscular dystrophy-related genes (4 families) and collagen myopathy-related genes (4 families). Less common myopathies included metabolic myopathy (2 families), congenital myasthenic syndrome (DOK7), congenital myopathy (ACTA1), tubular aggregate myopathy (STIM1), myofibrillar myopathy (FLNC), and mutation of CHD7, usually associated with the CHARGE syndrome. Inclusion of family members increased the diagnostic efficacy of WES, with a diagnostic rate of 60% for &quot;trios&quot; (an affected proband with both parents) vs 40% for single probands. A follow-up screening of patients whose conditions were undiagnosed on a targeted neuromuscular disease-related gene panel did not improve our diagnostic yiel.
 we achieved a diagnostic success rate of 45.0% in our difficult-to-diagnose cohort of patients with LGMD. We expand the clinical phenotypes associated with known myopathy genes, and we stress the importance of accurate clinical examination and histopathological results for interpretation of WES, with many diagnoses requiring follow-up review and ancillary investigations of biopsy specimens or serum sample.
ndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by ocular Coloboma, congenital Heart defects, choanal Atresia, Retardation, Genital anomalies and Ear anomalies. Over 90 % of typical CHARGE patients are mutated in the CHD7 gene, 65 %-70 % of the cases for all typical and suspected cases combined. The gene encoding for a protein involved in chromatin organization. The mutational spectrum include nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense mutations. Large deletions and genomic rearrangements are rar.
 here on a 5.9 years old male of Moroccan origin displaying classic clinical features of CHARGE syndrome. Using CGH array and NGS analysis we detected a microdeletion (184 kb) involving the promoter region and exon 1 of CHD7 gene and the flanking RAB2 gen.
nt observation suggests that deletion limited to the regulatory region of CHD7 is sufficient to cause the full blown CHARGE phenotype. Different size of deletions can result in different phenotypes, ranging from a milder to severe CHARGE syndrome; this is based on a combination of major and minor diagnostic characteristics, therefore to a more variable clinical features, likely due to the additive effect of other genetic imbalances. MLPA and CGH techniques should be considered in the diagnostic protocol of individuals with a clinical suspect of CHARGE syndrom.
ndrome is an autosomal-dominant disorder involved in multiple organs. Loss-of-function mutations in CHD7, a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) protein family, are known to cause the CHARGE syndrome. The purposes of this paper were to affirm the diagnosis and to identify the molecular basis of one atypical CHARGE syndrome patient from China, where only one CHARGE case was reported before. We employed the Verloes criteria to make a preliminary clinical diagnosis, and performed mutation screening of CHD7 via Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing. The patient was preliminary diagnosed as atypical CHARGE syndrome according to Verloes criteria with a novel heterozygous small deletion of CHD7 (CHD7: c.3462_3471delTCGCTTCCCT). As the second reported case of CHARGE syndrome in China, it was caused by one novel heterozygous mutation of the CHD7 gene. Our findings further reveal the relationship between CHD7 and CHARGE syndrome and provide a potential clinical diagnosis for CHARGE syndrom.
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) is classified as Kallmann syndrome (KS) with anosmia and normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical, endocrinological, and molecular characteristics in Korean patients with KS and nIH.
x patients from 25 unrelated families were included. Their clinical, endocrinological, and radiological findings were analyzed retrospectively. Mutation analysis of the GNRH1, GNRHR, KISS1, KISS1R, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, TACR3, FGF8, FGFR1, and KAL1 genes was performed in all patients. CHD7 and SOX10 were analyzed in patients with CHARGE (Coloboma, Heart defects, choanae Atresia, Growth retardation, Genitourinary abnormality, Ear abnormality) features or deafnes.
 patients, 16 had KS and 10 had nIHH. At diagnosis, mean chronologic age was 18.1 years in males and 18.0 years in females; height SDS were -0.67±1.35 in males, -1.12±1.86 in females; testis volume was 2.0±1.3 mL; and Tanner stage was 1.5. There were associated anomalies in some of the KS patients: hearing loss (n=6) and congenital heart disease (n=4). Absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulb/sulci was found in 84.62% of patients with KS. Molecular defects in KAL1, SOX10, and CHD7 were identified in 5 patients from 4 families (16.0%, 4/25 pedigrees). After sex hormone replacement therapy, there were improvement in sexual characteristics and the sexual functio.
y described the clinical, endocrinological, and molecular genetic features in IGD patients in Korea. Although the mutation screening was performed in 10 genes that cause IGD, molecular defects were identified in relatively small proportions of the cohor.
ndrome is caused by a dominant variant in the CHD7 gene. Multiple organ systems can be affected because of haploinsufficiency of CHD7 during embryonic development. CHARGE syndrome shares many clinical features with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Immunological abnormalities have been described, but are generally given little attention in studies on CHARGE syndrome. However, structured information on immunological abnormalities in CHARGE patients is necessary to develop optimal guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up in these patients. Here, we provide an overview of the current literature on immunological abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome. We also explore immunological abnormalities in comparable multiple congenital anomaly syndromes to identify common immunological phenotypes and genetic pathways that might regulate the immune system. Finally, we aim to identify gaps in our knowledge on the immunological aspects in CHARGE syndrome that need further study.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 18 February 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015..
c events including chromatin remodeling and histone modifications have recently emerged as important contributors to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on CHARGE syndrome, a multiple anomaly condition caused by mutations in the gene encoding CHD7, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein. CHD7 exhibits pleiotropic effects during embryonic development, consistent with highly variable clinical features in CHARGE syndrome. In this review, a historical description of CHARGE is provided, followed by establishment of diagnostic criteria, gene discovery, and development of animal models. Current understanding of epigenetic CHD7 functions and interacting proteins in cells and tissues is also presented, and final emphasis is placed on challenges and major questions to be answered with ongoing research effort.
cs Out-patient Department of Shanghai Children's Medical Center, we consulted a 3-year-old boy with multiple anomaly syndrome (congenital heart disease, cryptorchidism, congenital deafness, mental retardation, exophthalmos, laryngeal cartilage dysplasia and high arched palate). We ruled out the possibility of multiple deformities caused by genomic imbalances. The patient was then clinically considered to have CHARGE syndrome, an autosomal dominant multi-system disorder involving defects in multiple organs, and CHD7 is the only known gene associated with the syndrome. Sequencing analysis of CHD7 of the proband identified a de novo heterogeneous mutation (c.2916_2917del, p.Gln972HisfsX22), a two-nucleotide deletion causing reading frame shift and resulting in a truncated CHD7 protein. Computational structure analysis suggests that the truncated protein only contains the chromodomains of CHD7, but lacks the SWI2/SNF2-like ATPase/helicase domain and the DNA binding domain, which are indispensable for the proper function of the protein, especially on chromatin remodeling. The patient then received follow up treatment in different clinical departments in a long period. To our best knowledge, this is the first CHARGE syndrome in Chinese patients diagnosed by gene analysis. In summary, the clinical symptoms and the description of treatment in the present case, combined with genetic test and functional prediction of CHD7, are helpful for further understanding and genetic counseling of the CHARGE syndrom.
ned p53 activity during development, as occurs upon loss of the p53 negative regulators Mdm2 or Mdmx, causes early embryonic lethality. Surprisingly, co-expression of wild-type p53 and a transcriptionally-dead variant of p53, with mutations in both transactivation domains (p53(L25Q,W26S,F53Q,F54S)), also causes lethality, but later in gestation and in association with a host of very specific phenotypes reminiscent of a syndrome known as CHARGE. Molecular analyses revealed that wild-type p53 is inappropriately activated in p53(5,26,53,54/)(+) embryos, triggering cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis during development to cause CHARGE phenotypes. In addition, CHARGE syndrome is typically caused by mutations in the CHD7 chromatin remodeler, and we have shown that activated p53 contributes to phenotypes caused by CHD7-deficiency. Together, these studies provide new insight into CHARGE syndrome and expand our understanding of the role of p53 in diseases other than cance.
phila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a glutamatergic synapse that is structurally and functionally similar to mammalian glutamatergic synapses. These synapses can, as a result of changes in activity, alter the strength of their connections via processes that require chromatin remodeling and changes in gene expression. The chromodomain helicase DNA binding (CHD) protein, Kismet (Kis), is expressed in both motor neuron nuclei and postsynaptic muscle nuclei of the Drosophila larvae. Here, we show that Kis is important for motor neuron synaptic morphology, the localization and clustering of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, larval motor behavior, and synaptic transmission. Our data suggest that Kis is part of the machinery that modulates the development and function of the NMJ. Kis is the homolog to human CHD7, which is mutated in CHARGE syndrome. Thus, our data suggest novel avenues of investigation for synaptic defects associated with CHARGE syndrom.
4, CHD7 mutations have been a known cause of CHARGE (Coloboma, Heart defects, Atresia of choane, Retardation of growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, Ear anomalies) syndrome, but the full clinical spectrum of CHD7 mutations is only now gradually emerging. CHD7 mutations have been identified in patients who do not fulfill the clinical criteria for CHARGE syndrome and in patients with overlapping syndromes. Variable congenital heart defects occur in the majority of patients with CHD7 mutations, with an overrepresentation of atrioventricular septal defects and conotruncal heart defects. This prompted us to study CHD7 in 46 patients with these heart defects and one other feature of CHARGE syndrome. We identified two CHD7 variants that were inherited from a healthy parent (c.3778 + 17C &gt; T, c.7294G &gt; A), but no pathogenic CHD7 mutations. We conclude that CHD7 mutations are not a major cause of the atrioventricular septal defects and conotruncal heart defects, not even if one extra phenotypic feature of CHARGE syndrome is present. Therefore, CHD7 analysis should not be performed routinely in this group of patients. However, we do recommend adding CHD7 to massive parallel sequencing gene panels for diagnostic work in patients with syndromic heart defect.
ndrome is a multiple anomaly disorder in which patients present with a variety of phenotypes, including ocular coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and development, genitourinary hypoplasia and ear abnormalities. Despite 70-90% of CHARGE syndrome cases resulting from mutations in the gene CHD7, which encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller, the pathways underlying the diverse phenotypes remain poorly understood. Surprisingly, our studies of a knock-in mutant mouse strain that expresses a stabilized and transcriptionally dead variant of the tumour-suppressor protein p53 (p53(25,26,53,54)), along with a wild-type allele of p53 (also known as Trp53), revealed late-gestational embryonic lethality associated with a host of phenotypes that are characteristic of CHARGE syndrome, including coloboma, inner and outer ear malformations, heart outflow tract defects and craniofacial defects. We found that the p53(25,26,53,54) mutant protein stabilized and hyperactivated wild-type p53, which then inappropriately induced its target genes and triggered cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis during development. Importantly, these phenotypes were only observed with a wild-type p53 allele, as p53(25,26,53,54)(/-) embryos were fully viable. Furthermore, we found that CHD7 can bind to the p53 promoter, thereby negatively regulating p53 expression, and that CHD7 loss in mouse neural crest cells or samples from patients with CHARGE syndrome results in p53 activation. Strikingly, we found that p53 heterozygosity partially rescued the phenotypes in Chd7-null mouse embryos, demonstrating that p53 contributes to the phenotypes that result from CHD7 loss. Thus, inappropriate p53 activation during development can promote CHARGE phenotypes, supporting the idea that p53 has a critical role in developmental syndromes and providing important insight into the mechanisms underlying CHARGE syndrom.
 in CHD7, a gene previously implicated in CHARGE (coloboma, heart defect, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies) syndrome, have been reported in patients presenting with Kallmann syndrome (KS) or congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH). Most mutations causing CHARGE syndrome result in premature stop codons and occur de novo, but the proportion of truncating vs nontruncating mutations in KS and CHH patients is still unknow.
tive of the study was to determine the nature, prevalence, mode of transmission, and clinical spectrum of CHD7 mutations in a large series of patient.
d 209 KS and 94 CHH patients. These patients had not been diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome according to the current criteria. We searched for mutations in 16 KS and CHH genes including CHD.
presumably pathogenic mutations in CHD7 in 24 KS patients but not in CHH patients. Nontruncating mutations (16 missense and a two-codon duplication) were more prevalent than truncating mutations (three nonsense, three frame shift, and a splice site), which contrasts with patients presenting with typical CHARGE syndrome. Thus, the clinical spectrum associated with CHD7 mutations may be partly explained by genotype/phenotype correlations. Eight patients also had congenital deafness and one had a cleft lip/palate, whereas six had both. For 10 patients, the presence of diverse features of the CHARGE spectrum in at least one relative argues against a de novo appearance of the missense mutation, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in five familie.
ng the large prevalence and clinical spectrum of CHD7 mutations, it will be particularly relevant to genetic counseling to search for mutations in this gene in KS patients seeking fertility treatment, especially if KS is associated with deafness and cleft lip/palat.
ndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene. Although central nervous system defects have been reported, the detailed description and analysis of these anomalies in CHARGE syndrome patients lag far behind the description of other, more easily observed defects. We recently described cerebellar abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome patients and used mouse models to identify the underlying causes. Our studies identified altered expression of the homeobox genes Otx2 and Gbx2 in the developing neural tube of Chd7(-/-) embryos. Furthermore, we showed that the expression of Fgf8 is sensitive to Chd7 gene dosage and demonstrated an epistatic relationship between these genes during cerebellar vermis development. These findings provided, for the first time, an example of cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in a human syndrome that can be linked to deregulated FGF signaling. I discuss some of these observations and their implications for CHARGE syndrom.
ine whether patients with semicircular canal dysplasia have mutations in CHD.
ndrome is a nonrandom clustering of congenital anomalies, including ocular coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia or stenosis, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, and inner and outer ear anomalies including deafness. Semicircular canal dysplasia has been included as a major diagnostic criterion for CHARGE syndrome. Mutations in the gene CHD7 on chromosome 8q12.1 are a major cause of CHARGE syndrome, but the extent to which patients with semicircular canal dysplasia have CHD7 mutations is not fully understoo.
tional analysis of CHD7 in 12 patients with semicircular canal dysplasia and variable clinical features of CHARGE syndrom.
fied 6 CHD7 mutations, 5 of which occurred in patients who fulfilled Verloes' diagnostic criteria for typical CHARGE syndrome, and three of which were previously unreported. Of the 3 remaining CHD7 mutation-positive patients, one had atypical CHARGE by diagnostic criteria. Four MRI records were available, which revealed 2 patients with cochlear nerve aplasia and 1 patient with Chiari 1 malformatio.
a provide additional evidence that CHD7 mutations are a significant cause of semicircular canal atresia in children with full or partial CHARGE syndrom.
ous mutations in the chromatin remodeling gene CHD7 cause CHARGE syndrome, a developmental disorder with variable craniofacial dysmorphisms and respiratory difficulties. The molecular etiologies of these malformations are not well understood. Homozygous Chd7 null mice die by E11, whereas Chd7(Gt/+) heterozygous null mice are a viable and excellent model of CHARGE. We explored skeletal phenotypes in Chd7(Gt/+) and Chd7 conditional knockout mice, using Foxg1-Cre to delete Chd7 (Foxg1-CKO) in the developing eye, ear, nose, pharyngeal pouch, forebrain, and gut and Wnt1-Cre (Wnt1-CKO) to delete Chd7 in migrating neural crest cell.
 mice exhibited postnatal respiratory distress and death, dysplasia of the eye, concha, and frontal bone, hypoplastic maxillary shelves and nasal epithelia, and reduced tracheal rings. Wnt1-CKO mice exhibited frontal and occipital bone dysplasia, hypoplasia of the maxillary shelves and mandible, and cleft palate. In contrast, heterozygous Chd7(Gt/+) mice had apparently normal skeletal developmen.
al deletion of Chd7 in ectodermal and endodermal derivatives (Foxg1-Cre) or migrating neural crest cells (Wnt1-Cre) results in varied and more severe craniofacial defects than in Chd7(Gt/+) mice. These studies indicate that CHD7 has an important, dosage-dependent role in development of several different craniofacial tissue.
romodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like gene) has been demonstrated as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the role of CHD1L in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenesis hasn't been elucidated. In this study, the expression and amplification status of CHD1L were examined by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization respectively in 248 surgically resected NSCLCs. The associations between CHD1L expression and clinicopathologic features and the prognostic value of CHD1L were analyzed. Overexpression and amplification of CHD1L was found in 42.1% and 17.7% of NSCLCs, respectively. The frequency of CHD1L overexpression (53.2% vs. 28.1%, P = 0.002) and amplication (25.2% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.020) in adenocarcinoma (ADC), was much higher than that in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). CHD1L overexpression was associated closely with ascending pN status (P &lt; 0.001), advanced clinical stage (P = 0.001) and tumor distant metastasis (P = 0.001) in ADCs, but not in SCCs. For the whole cohort and ADC patients, univariate survival analysis demonstrated a significant association of CHD1L overexpression with shortened survival; and in multivariate analysis, CHD1L overexpression was evaluated as a independent predictor for overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. These results suggested that overexpression of CHD1L is positively associated with tumor metastasis of lung ADC, and might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for lung ADC patient.
ain-helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5) is an important tumor suppressor gene deleted from 1p36.31 in neuroblastomas (NBs). High CHD5 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, but deletion or low expression is frequent in high-risk tumors. We explored the role of CHD5 expression in the neuronal differentiation of NB cell line.
ines SH-SY5Y (SY5Y), NGP, SK-N-DZ, IMR5, LAN5, SK-N-FI, NB69 and SH-EP were treated with 1-10 μM 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) for 3-12 days. qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed to measure mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. Morphological differences were examined by both phase contrast and immunofluorescence studie.
 of SY5Y cells with 13cRA caused upregulation of CHD5 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (1, 5, or 10 μM for 7 or 12 days) and also induced neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, both NGP and SK-N-DZ cells showed CHD5 upregulation and neuronal differentiation after 13cRA treatment. In contrast, 13cRA treatment of IMR5, LAN5, or SK-N-FI induced neither CHD5 expression nor neuronal differentiation. NB69 cells showed two different morphologies (neuronal and substrate adherent) after 12 days treatment with 10 μM of 13cRA. CHD5 expression was high in the neuronal cells, but low/absent in the flat, substrate adherent cells. Finally, NGF treatment caused upregulation of CHD5 expression and neuronal differentiation in SY5Y cells transfected to express TrkA (SY5Y-TrkA) but not in TrkA-null parental SY5Y cells, and both changes were blocked by a pan-TRK inhibito.
 with 13cRA induces neuronal differentiation only in NB cells that upregulate CHD5. In addition, NGF induced CHD5 upregulation and neuronal differentiation only in TrkA expressing cells. Together, these results suggest that CHD5 is downstream of TrkA, and CHD5 expression may be crucial for neuronal differentiation induced by either 13cRA or TrkA/NGF signalin.
gress has recently been achieved in the understanding of the genomic alterations driving chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, the specific molecular mechanisms governing chromatin remodeling in CLL are unknown. Here we report the genetic and functional characterization of somatic mutations affecting the chromatin remodeler CHD2, one of the most frequently mutated genes in CLL (5.3%) and in monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL, 7%), a B-cell expansion that can evolve to CLL. Most of the mutations affecting CHD2, identified by whole-exome sequencing of 456 CLL and 43 MBL patients, are either truncating or affect conserved residues in functional domains, thus supporting a putative role for CHD2 as a tumor suppressor gene. CHD2 mutants show altered nuclear distribution, and a chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) mutant affected in its DNA-binding domain exhibits defective association with active chromatin. Clinicobiological analyses show that most CLL patients carrying CHD2 mutations also present mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHVs), being the most frequently mutated gene in this prognostic subgroup. This is the first study providing functional evidence supporting CHD2 as a cancer driver and opens the way to further studies of the role of this chromatin remodeler in CL.
hromosome maintenance complex (MCM) proteins are required for processive DNA replication and are a target of S-phase checkpoints. The eukaryotic MCM complex consists of six proteins (MCM2-7) that form a heterohexameric ring with DNA helicase activity, which is loaded on chromatin to form the pre-replication complex. Upon entry in S phase, the helicase is activated and opens the DNA duplex to recruit DNA polymerases at the replication fork. The MCM complex thus plays a crucial role during DNA replication, but recent work suggests that MCM proteins could also be involved in DNA repair. Here, we employed a combination of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics with immunoprecipitation of green fluorescent protein-tagged fusion proteins to identify proteins interacting with the MCM complex, and quantify changes in interactions in response to DNA damage. Interestingly, the MCM complex showed very dynamic changes in interaction with proteins such as Importin7, the histone chaperone ASF1, and the Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 3 (CHD3) following DNA damage. These changes in interactions were accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation and ubiquitination on specific sites on the MCM proteins and an increase in the co-localization of the MCM complex with γ-H2AX, confirming the recruitment of these proteins to sites of DNA damage. In summary, our data indicate that the MCM proteins is involved in chromatin remodeling in response to DNA damag.
c gene expression is developmentally regulated, in part by chromatin remodelling, and its dysregulation has been linked to cancer. CHD5 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 5) is a tumour suppressor gene (TSG) that maps to a region of consistent deletion on 1p36.31&nbsp;in neuroblastomas (NBs) and other tumour types. CHD5 encodes a protein with chromatin remodelling, helicase and DNA-binding motifs that is preferentially expressed in neural and testicular tissues. CHD5 is highly homologous to CHD3 and CHD4, which are the core subunits of nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation (NuRD) complexes. To determine if CHD5 forms a similar complex, we performed studies on nuclear extracts from NBLS, SY5Y (both with endogenous CHD5 expression), NLF (CHD5 null) and NLF cells stably transfected with CHD5 cDNA (wild-type and V5-histidine-tagged). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with either CHD5 antibody or antibody to V5/histidine-tagged protein. We identified NuRD components both by GST-FOG1 (Friend Of GATA1) pull-down and by IP. We also performed MS/MS analysis to confirm the presence of CHD5 or other protein components of the NuRD complex, as well as to identify other novel proteins. CHD5 was clearly associated with all canonical NuRD components, including metastasis-associated protein (MTA)1/2, GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A), histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2, retinoblastoma-binding protein (RBBP)4/7 and methyl DNA-binding domain protein (MBD)2/3, as determined by Western blotting and MS/MS. Our data suggest CHD5 forms a NuRD complex similar to CHD4. However, CHD5-NuRD may also have unique protein associations that confer functional specificity and may contribute to normal development and to tumour suppression in NB and other cancer.

began at a mean of 26 months (12-42) with myoclonic seizures in all 10 cases. Seven exhibited exquisite clinical photosensitivity; 6 self-induced with the television. Absence seizures occurred in 9 patients including typical (4), atypical (2), and absence seizures with eyelid myoclonias (4). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred in 9 of 10 cases with a mean onset of 5.8 years. Convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus were later features (6/10, mean onset 9 years). Tonic (40%) and atonic (30%) seizures also occurred. In 3 cases, an unusual seizure type, the atonic-myoclonic-absence was captured on video. A phenotypic spectrum was identified with 7 cases having moderate to severe intellectual disability and refractory seizures including tonic attacks. Their mean age at onset was 23 months. Three cases had a later age at onset (34 months) with relative preservation of intellect and an initial response to antiepileptic medicatio.
typic spectrum of CHD2 encephalopathy has distinctive features of myoclonic epilepsy, marked clinical photosensitivity, atonic-myoclonic-absence, and intellectual disability ranging from mild to severe. Recognition of this genetic entity will permit earlier diagnosis and enable the development of targeted therapie.
opment and progression of melanoma have been attributed to independent or combined genetic and epigenetic events. There has been remarkable progress in understanding melanoma pathogenesis in terms of genetic alterations. However, recent studies have revealed a complex involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression, including methylation, chromatin modification and remodeling, and the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. The roles of gene methylation and miRNAs have been relatively well studied in melanoma, but other studies have shown that changes in chromatin status and in the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs can lead to altered regulation of key genes. Taken together, they affect the functioning of signaling pathways that influence each other, intersect, and form networks in which local perturbations disturb the activity of the whole system. Here, we focus on how epigenetic events intertwine with these pathways and contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of melanom.
ain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) plays a pivotal role in chromatin-remodeling and has been implicated in the development of cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the association of CHD4 gene variants with cancer. Nine missense single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in CHD4 were retrieved from genotyping, by an exome-chip, 2,343 consecutive autopsy cases, in which the presence or absence of cancer was pathologically reviewed. The association of CHD4 variants with the presence of cancer and with different types of cancer was determined. Interaction with smoking was also determined. There were 1,446 patients with cancer and 897 patients without cancer. Of the nine SNVs, eight SNVs were monomorphic, while two nonsynonymous SNVs; rs7479004 (p.D140E) and rs1639122 (p.E139D) were further verified by direct sequencing. The p.D140E was associated with the presence of cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-3.44, P = 0.001), but not p.E139D. The effect size was larger in the smokers (adjusted OR, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.82-11.9; P =0.001), suggesting that there may be a gene environment interaction. For individual cancer types, p.D140E was associated with lung cancer (adjusted OR, 3.99; 95% CI, 2.07-7.67; P &lt; 0.001), malignant lymphoma (adjusted OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.43-7.33; P = 0.005), and rectum cancer (adjusted OR, 6.23; 95% CI, 2.31-16.8; P &lt; 0.001). A nonsynonymous SNV of CHD4, p.D140E, confers a risk of cancer and may interact with smoking habit to increase the ris.
 consists of ordered nucleosomal arrays that are controlled by highly conserved adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. One such remodeler, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (Chd1), is believed to play an integral role in nucleosomal organization, as the loss of Chd1 is known to disrupt chromatin. However, the specificity and basis for the functional and physical localization of Chd1 on chromatin remains largely unknow.
ome-wide approaches, we found that the loss of Chd1 significantly disrupted nucleosome arrays within the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes. We also found that Chd1 is physically recruited to gene bodies, and that its occupancy specifically corresponds to that of the early elongating form of RNA polymerase, RNAPII Ser 5-P. Conversely, RNAPII Ser 5-P occupancy was affected by the loss of Chd1, suggesting that Chd1 is associated with early transcription elongation. Surprisingly, the occupancy of RNAPII Ser 5-P was affected by the loss of Chd1 specifically at intron-containing genes. Nucleosome turnover was also affected at these sites in the absence of Chd1. We also found that deletion of the histone methyltransferase for H3K36 (SET2) did not affect either Chd1 occupancy or nucleosome organization genome-wid.
pecifically recruited onto the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes in an elongation-dependent but H3K36me3-independent manner. Chd1 co-localizes with the early elongating form of RNA polymerase, and affects the occupancy of RNAPII only at genes containing introns, suggesting a role in relieving splicing-related pausing of RNAPI.
ngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with a high metastatic ability. Recent studies have implicated the role of chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) gene as a novel oncogene; however, the functional role of CHD1L in NPC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of CHD1L positivity in NPC. CHD1L protein expression was examined by performing western blot analysis of 30 fresh NPC tissues and conducting immunohistochemistry tests of 133 NPC samples between December 1, 2005 and December 1, 2009. The correlations of CHD1L expression status with clinicopathological features and prognosis were investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 88 of 133 (66.2%) paraffin-embedded NPC biopsies exhibited positive expression of CHD1L, but all non-cancerous nasopharyngeal specimens were negative for CHD1L expression. In addition, positive CHD1L expression was strongly associated with an advanced clinical stage (P=0.016), recurrence (P=0.002) and the metastasis status (P=0.031) of NPC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with CHD1L-positive NPC had significantly shorter overall survival (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis indicated that CHD1L protein expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 7.916; 95% confidence interval, 2.067-16.034; P=0.003) in patients with NPC. These results indicate that CHD1L is a prognostic marker for NP.
g mutations of chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8), and of many other genes with diverse functions, are strong-effect risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting multiple mechanisms of pathogenesis. We explored the transcriptional networks that CHD8 regulates in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by reducing its expression and then integrating transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) with genome-wide CHD8 binding (ChIP sequencing). Suppressing CHD8 to levels comparable with the loss of a single allele caused altered expression of 1,756 genes, 64.9% of which were up-regulated. CHD8 showed widespread binding to chromatin, with 7,324 replicated sites that marked 5,658 genes. Integration of these data suggests that a limited array of direct regulatory effects of CHD8 produced a much larger network of secondary expression changes. Genes indirectly down-regulated (i.e., without CHD8-binding sites) reflect pathways involved in brain development, including synapse formation, neuron differentiation, cell adhesion, and axon guidance, whereas CHD8-bound genes are strongly associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Genes associated with ASD were strongly enriched among indirectly down-regulated loci (P &lt; 10(-8)) and CHD8-bound genes (P = 0.0043), which align with previously identified coexpression modules during fetal development. We also find an intriguing enrichment of cancer-related gene sets among CHD8-bound genes (P &lt; 10(-10)). In vivo suppression of chd8 in zebrafish produced macrocephaly comparable to that of humans with inactivating mutations. These data indicate that heterozygous disruption of CHD8 precipitates a network of gene-expression changes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways in which many ASD-associated genes may converge on shared mechanisms of pathogenesi.
odomain helicase/adenosine triphosphatase DNA binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L) is a recently identified oncogene localized at 1q21. CHD1L protein over-expression in primary hepatocellular carcinoma is correlated with enhanced apoptosis inhibition, reduced chemosensitivity and shortened patient survival. However, CHD1L protein status or mRNA expression in breast cancer and its clinical significance remain obscur.
tudy, immunohistochemical staining for CHD1L expression was performed on tissue microarrays containing 179 primary invasive breast cancers and 65 matched normal breast tissue specimens. Clinico-pathological features were collected and compared between different CHD1L statuses. Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Also, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was employed to evaluate the mRNA level expression of CHD1L in six breast cancer cell line.
of CHD1L over-expression was observed in 87 of the 179 patients (48.6%), which associated with a younger age (P = 0.011), higher grade (P = 0.004), higher Ki-67 index (P = 0.018) and HER2 over-expression/amplification (P = 0.037). After a median follow-up of 55 months, patients with presence of CHD1L over-expression had significantly poorer DFS (82.6% Vs 76.3%, P = 0.035), but not OS (87.0% Vs 94.9%, P = 0.439). In multivariate analysis, CHD1L status (HR = 2.169, [95%CI, 1.029-4.573], P = 0.042), triple negative subtype (HR = 2.809, [95%CI 1.086-7.264], P = 0.033) and HER2 positive subtype (HR = 5.221, [95%CI 1.788-15.240], P = 0.002) were identified as independent prognostic factors for DFS. In vitro study indicated that relative mRNA expression level of CHD1L was higher in breast cancer cell lines, especially in MDA-MB-231 and LM2-4175, when compared to normal breast epithelial cell lin.
of CHD1L over-expression is probably associated with aggressive tumor biology in breast cancer. CHD1L status might be a novel prognostic biomarker for patients with breast cance.

were screened for mutations in FGFR1. The functional consequences of mutations were predicted by in silico structural and conservation analysi.
ous FGFR1 mutations were identified in six (12%) kindreds. These consisted of frameshift mutations (p.Pro33-Alafs*17 and p.Tyr654*) and missense mutations in the signal peptide (p.Trp4Cys), in the D1 extracellular domain (p.Ser96Cys) and in the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain (p.Met719Val). A missense mutation was identified in the alternatively spliced exon 8A (p.Ala353Thr) that exclusively affects the D3 extracellular domain of FGFR1 isoform IIIb. Structure-based and sequence-based prediction methods and the absence of these variants in 200 normal controls were all consistent with a critical role for the mutations in the activity of the receptor. Oligogenic inheritance (FGFR1/CHD7/PROKR2) was found in one patien.
 isoforms, IIIb and IIIc, result from alternative splicing of exons 8A and 8B, respectively. Loss-of-function of isoform IIIc is a cause of IHH, whereas isoform IIIb is thought to be redundant. Ours is the first report of normosmic IHH associated with a mutation in the alternatively spliced exon 8A and suggests that this disorder can be caused by defects in either of the two alternatively spliced FGFR1 isoform.
syndrome (KS) is characterized by isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) with anosmia and is sometimes associated with cleft lip/palate (CLP). In order to describe the clinical features, genetic etiology, and treatment outcome of KS males with CLP, we performed genetic screening for 15 known causal IHH genes (KAL1, FGFR1, NELF, FGF8, CHD7, WDR11, SEMA3A, KISS1R, KISS1, PROKR2, PROK2, TAC3, TACR3, GNRH1, and GNRHR) in four KS with CLP patients and six IHH patients without CLP. Two novel heterozygous missense mutations in FGFR1, (NM_001174066): c.776G&gt;A (p.G259E) and (NM_001174066): c.358C&gt;T (p.R120C), were identified in a 23-year-old KS male with cleft lip and an 18-year-old KS patient with cleft lip and palate, dental agenesis, and high arched palate, respectively. These two mutations were not presented in their healthy parents and 200 normal controls. One novel heterozygous missense mutation in KISS1R, (NM_032551): c.587C&gt;A (p.P196H), was identified in an 18-year-old KS male with cleft lip and dental agenesis who developed sperm after being treated with gonadotropin. This mutation was also presented in his healthy father and grandfather. These results have implications for the diagnosis, genetic counseling, and treatment of KS and CLP males with mutations in FGFR1 gen.
ic etiology of atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is unknown in 40% cases. Conventional sequencing and arrays have identified the etiology in only a minority of nonsyndromic individuals with AVS.
me sequencing was performed in 81 unrelated probands with AVSD to identify potentially causal variants in a comprehensive set of 112 genes with strong biological relevance to AVS.
cant enrichment of rare and rare damaging variants was identified in the gene set, compared with controls (odds ratio (OR): 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35-1.71; P = 4.8 × 10(-11)). The enrichment was specific to AVSD probands, compared with a cohort without AVSD with tetralogy of Fallot (OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.84-2.76; P = 2.2 × 10(-16)). Six genes (NIPBL, CHD7, CEP152, BMPR1a, ZFPM2, and MDM4) were enriched for rare variants in AVSD compared with controls, including three syndrome-associated genes (NIPBL, CHD7, and CEP152). The findings were confirmed in a replication cohort of 81 AVSD proband.
 in genes with strong biological relevance to AVSD, including syndrome-associated genes, can contribute to AVSD, even in those with isolated heart disease. The identification of a gene set associated with AVSD will facilitate targeted genetic screening in this cohort.Genet Med advance online publication 21 May 2015Genetics in Medicine (2015); doi:10.1038/gim.2015.6.
 T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a potentially devastating malignancy. The pathogenesis of this cancer remains poorly elucidated. Previous studies focused on analysis of expression and function of known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, emerging reports highlight that it is also important to analyze the expression of genes that are ectopically expressed in CTCL (e.g., embryonic stem cell genes (ESC), cancer testis (CT) genes, etc.). Currently, it is not known whether ESC genes are expressed in CTCL. In the current work, we analyze by RT-PCR the expression of 26 ESC genes, many of which are known to regulate pluripotency and promote cancer stem cell-like phenotype, in a historic cohort of 60 patients from Boston and in a panel of 11 patient-derived CTCL cell lines and compare such expression to benign inflammatory dermatoses that often clinically mimic CTCL. Our findings document that many critical ESC genes including NANOG, SOX2, OCT4 (POU5F1) and their upstream and downstream signaling members are expressed in CTCL. Similarly, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) genes (i.e., EZH2, EED, and SUZ12) are also expressed in CTCL lesional skin. Furthermore, select ESC genes (OCT4, EED, TCF3, THAP11, CHD7, TIP60, TRIM28) are preferentially expressed in CTCL samples when compared to benign skin biopsies. Our work suggests that ESC genes are ectopically expressed together with CT genes, thymocyte development genes and B cell-specific genes and may be working in concert to promote tumorigenesis. Specifically, while ESC genes may be promoting cancer stem cell-like phenotype, CT genes may be contributing to aneuploidy and genomic instability by producing aberrant chromosomal translocations. Further analysis of ESC expression and function in this cancer will greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of CTCL and will help us identify novel therapeutic target.
almia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is the master regulator of the melanocyte lineage. To understand how MITF regulates transcription, we used tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry to define a comprehensive MITF interactome identifying novel cofactors involved in transcription, DNA replication and repair, and chromatin organisation. We show that MITF interacts with a PBAF chromatin remodelling complex comprising BRG1 and CHD7. BRG1 is essential for melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and for normal melanocyte development in vivo. MITF and SOX10 actively recruit BRG1 to a set of MITF-associated regulatory elements (MAREs) at active enhancers. Combinations of MITF, SOX10, TFAP2A, and YY1 bind between two BRG1-occupied nucleosomes thus defining both a signature of transcription factors essential for the melanocyte lineage and a specific chromatin organisation of the regulatory elements they occupy. BRG1 also regulates the dynamics of MITF genomic occupancy. MITF-BRG1 interplay thus plays an essential role in transcription regulation in melanom.
e challenging issues in patients with complex problems is that the various diseases and their treatment can influence each other and present unusual hurdles in management. We investigated one such complex case. A 34-year-old XY male presented with azoospermia, detected on semen analysis for pre-orchidectomy sperm banking. He had a 20-year history of gender dysphoria and bilateral breast swelling. The patient suffered a deep vein thrombosis at the age of 19&nbsp;years. Examination confirmed clinical features of Kallmann syndrome including unilateral cryptorchidism, micropenis, congenital anosmia, and bimanual synkinesis (mirror movements), with reduced serum testosterone and normal gonadotropin levels demonstrating hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. MRI showed missing olfactory bulbs. Osteopenia and reduced vitamin D levels of 21&nbsp;nmol/L were identified. He was found to harbor a heterozygous factor-V-Leiden mutation. The genetic basis of Kallmann syndrome remains unknown: his screening tests were negative for mutations in CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, GNRH1, GNRHR, HS6ST1, KAL1, KISS1R, KISS1, NELF, PROK2, PROKR2, TAC3, and TACR3. The patient initially declined testosterone therapy with a view to undergo gender reassignment. Over the next 2&nbsp;years, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of weakness and paresthesia, associated with classical MRI appearances of multiple sclerosis-related demyelination in the spinal cord and brain. Although it was difficult to elucidate an association between the patient's gender dysphoria and untreated congenital hypogonadism, his desire to become female together with his co-existing thrombophilia, presented challenges to the administration of hormone treatment. Furthermore, we have considered an association between multiple sclerosis and hypogonadotropic hypogonadis.
mprovement is important for the poultry industry, contributing to increased efficiency of meat production and quality. Because breast muscle is the most valuable part of the chicken carcass, knowledge of polymorphisms influencing this trait can help breeding programs. Therefore, the complete genome of 18 chickens from two different experimental lines (broiler and layer) from EMBRAPA was sequenced, and SNPs and INDELs were detected in a QTL region for breast muscle deposition on chicken chromosome 2 between microsatellite markers MCW0185 and MCW0264 (105,849-112,649 kb). Initially, 94,674 unique SNPs and 10,448 unique INDELs were identified in the target region. After quality filtration, 77% of the SNPs (85,765) and 60% of the INDELs (7828) were retained. The studied region contains 66 genes, and functional annotation of the filtered variants identified 517 SNPs and three INDELs in exonic regions. Of these, 357 SNPs were classified as synonymous, 153 as non-synonymous, three as stopgain, four INDELs as frameshift and three INDELs as non-frameshift. These exonic mutations were identified in 37 of the 66 genes from the target region, three of which are related to muscle development (DTNA, RB1CC1 and MOS). Fifteen non-tolerated SNPs were detected in several genes (MEP1B, PRKDC, NSMAF, TRAPPC8, SDR16C5, CHD7, ST18 and RB1CC1). These loss-of-function and exonic variants present in genes related to muscle development can be considered candidate variants for further studies in chickens. Further association studies should be performed with these candidate mutations as should validation in commercial populations to allow a better explanation of QTL effect.
aesthesia (SA) has high success rates. However, inadequate block after SA has been reported even in the absence of technical problems. Various mechanisms for failed SA (FSA) have been proposed, but reports of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of local anaesthetics (LA) after FSA are scarce. We report lumbar CSF concentrations of bupivacaine in 20 patients in whom adequate block after subarachnoid injection failed to develo.
nts with inadequate block after subarachnoid injection of plain bupivacaine 0.5% and in whom a second subarachnoid injection of LA was to be performed as a rescue technique were eligible for entry into this study. A CSF sample was withdrawn immediately before injection of the second dose of LA. Patients in whom failure was obviously due to technical problems or inadequate dosage were excluded. Bupivacaine concentrations were assessed with high-performance liquid chromatograph.
e study period of 15 months, 2600 spinal anaesthetics were performed. The failure rate was 2.7% (71 patients). In 20 patients (0.77%), CSF concentrations of bupivacaine were determined, which ranged from 3.36 to 1020 microg ml(-1.
e CSF concentration of LA is a common reason for FSA. However, in 12 of our 20 patients, concentrations were above 73 microg ml(-1), a concentration that should lead to an adequate block. In these patients, maldistribution of bupivacaine could be responsible for FSA. In view of the absence of sufficient block, despite adequate lumbar CSF concentrations of bupivacaine, concerns about neurotoxicity with repeat injections may be warrante.

ed the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group trials register (September 2002). This register is compiled by methodical searches of BIOSIS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, Sociofile, supplemented with hand searching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings. References of all identified studies were also inspected for more trial.
ant randomised controlled trials that compared atypical antipsychotic drugs with other treatments for elderly people (at least 80% of whom should be over 65 years of age) with a recent (within five years) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia like illnesses such as delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform psychosis or paraphreni.
ions were inspected by the principal reviewer (SA) and papers ordered and re-inspected (by IA, NAQ, SP) to ensure reliable selection. Methodological quality of trials would have been assessed using the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook criteria and data would have been independently extracted. Data were to have been excluded if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For homogeneous dichotomous data the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH), were to have been calculated based on an intention-to-treat basi.
c searching produced 119 references, 65 of which were selected for examination of the full text. These referred to 38 studies. Not one study met the entry criteria for this review. Most were randomised but involved elderly people with chronic schizophrenia. Four trials involved people with schizophrenia, and did include a minority who suffered from paraphrenia. Outcomes for this sub-group, however, were not reported. One randomised study (n=18) did focus on late onset schizophrenia, but unfortunately the two treatments under evaluation, remoxipride and thioridazine, have both been withdrawn from us.
no trial-based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of late onset schizophrenia. This review highlights the need for good quality controlled clinical trials to address the effects of antipsychotic drugs for this group. Such trials are possible. Until they are undertaken people with late onset schizophrenia will be treated by doctors using clinical judgement and habit to guide prescribin.
y examined the contribution of nonparental child-care services received during the preschool years to the development of social behavior between kindergarten and the end of elementary school with a birth cohort from Québec, Canada (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,544). Mothers reported on the use of child-care services, while elementary school teachers rated children's shyness, social withdrawal, prosociality, opposition, and aggression. Children who received nonparental child-care services were less shy, less socially withdrawn, more oppositional, and more aggressive at school entry (age 6&nbsp;years). However, these differences disappeared during elementary school as children who received exclusive parental care caught up with those who received nonparental care services. This &quot;catch-up&quot; effect from the perspective of children's adaptation to the social group is discusse.
on therapy of aliskiren and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) has been reported to be effective for reducing the level of proteinuria. However, it remains unclear whether this combination therapy contributes to suppression of kidney disease progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aliskiren on hard renal endpoints, when added to an ARB, in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD.
 design was a prospective, randomized open-label design. 83 CKD patients (52 men and 31 women) were enrolled and assigned randomly to an aliskiren add-on group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;42) or control group (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;41). Entry criteria included elevated serum creatinine ≥1.5&nbsp;mg/dl, urine protein excretion (≥1+ on urine dipstick test), and hypertension. All participants were treated with an ARB. The follow-up period was 12&nbsp;months. 12 participants were withdrawn during the study period and the study was terminated in January 2012 as a consequence of the results of the interim analysis of the ALTITUDE stud.
ents in the aliskiren group and seven patients in the control group started dialysis. Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in one patient in the control group. A Cox proportional hazards test showed that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with aliskiren and ARB was not associated with improvement in hard renal endpoint.
de that aliskiren add-on therapy to an ARB may not give any benefit and, therefore, should not be recommended in CKD patient.
passes and attempts while administering spinal anesthesia are associated with a greater incidence of postdural puncture headache, paraesthesia, and spinal hematoma. We hypothesized that the routine use of a preprocedural ultrasound-guided paramedian technique for spinal anesthesia would reduce the number of passes required to achieve entry into the subarachnoid space when compared with the conventional landmark-guided midline approac.
ed consenting patients scheduled for elective total joint replacements (hip and knee) were randomized into group C (conventional) and group P (preprocedural ultrasound-guided paramedian technique) with 50 in each group. The patients were blinded to the study group. All spinal anesthetics were administered by a consultant anesthesiologist. In group C, spinal anesthetic was done via the midline approach using clinically palpated landmarks. In group P, a preprocedural ultrasound scan was used to mark the paramedian insertion site, and spinal anesthetic was performed via the paramedian approac.
ge number of passes (defined as the number of forward advancements of the spinal needle in a given interspinous space, i.e., withdrawal and redirection of spinal needle without exiting the skin) in group P was approximately 0.34 times that in group C, a difference that was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Similarly, the average number of attempts (defined as the number of times the spinal needle was withdrawn from the skin and reinserted) in group P was approximately 0.25 times that of group C (P = 0.0021). In group P, on an average, it took 81.5 (99% confidence interval, 68.4-97 seconds) seconds longer to identify the landmarks than in group C (P = 0.0002). All other parameters, including grading of palpated landmarks, time taken for spinal anesthetic injection, periprocedural pain scores, periprocedural patient discomfort visual analog scale score, conversion to general anesthetic, paresthesia, and radicular pain during needle insertion, were similar between the 2 group.
se of paramedian spinal anesthesia in the orthopedic patient population undergoing joint replacement surgery, guided by preprocedure ultrasound examination, significantly decreases the number of passes and attempts needed to enter the subarachnoid spac.
consolidated evidence that the burden of inappropriate laboratory test requests is very high, up to 70%. We describe here the function of a computerized alert system linked to the order entry, designed to limit the number of potentially inappropriate laboratory test request.
rized alert system based on re-testing intervals and entailing the generation of pop-up alerts when preset criteria of appropriateness for 15 laboratory tests were violated was implemented in two clinical wards of the University Hospital of Parma. The effectiveness of the system for limiting potentially inappropriate tests was monitored for 6month.
765/3539 (22%) test requests violated the preset criteria of appropriateness and generated the appearance of electronic alert. After alert appearance, 591 requests were annulled (17% of total tests requested and 77% of tests alerted, respectively). The total number of test requests violating the preset criteria of inappropriateness constantly decreased over time (26% in the first three months of implementation versus 17% in the following period; p&lt;0.001). The total financial saving of test withdrawn was 3387 Euros (12.8% of the total test cost) throughout the study perio.
ts of this study suggest that a computerized alert system may be effective to limit the inappropriateness of laboratory test requests, generating significant economic saving and educating physicians to a more efficient use of laboratory resource.
tive of this communication is to disseminate scientific and technical information for early diagnosis of Fluorosis; recent developments in care and management of patients of Fluorosi.
ds collected from patients suspected of Fluorosis referred by hospitals, samples of drinking water used by them are the materials that have been investigated. Fluoride level in body fluids and water samples are tested by the ion selective electrode (ISE) potentiometry. Forearm X-ray radiograph is taken to assess interosseous membrane calcification. Upon diagnosis of the disease, two corrective measures, namely diet editing and diet counselling are introduced for practice in daily life. In the former, all sources of fluoride ingestion and use are withdrawn whereas in the latter, the patient is encouraged to consume a diet rich in essential nutrients, antioxidants and micronutrients through fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The patients are monitored at intervals to assess fluoride in body fluids. Reduction in fluoride levels has a direct relationship with disappearance of health complaints and subsequent recover.
e studies (5 male + 3 female) are described. Patients'complaints are gastrointestinal discomfort, polyuria, polydipsia, muscle weakness, fatigue and joint pain. Body fluids may have high fluoride with normal or high fluoride level in drinking water.The main source(s) of fluoride entry identified are (i) consuming fluoride contaminated food/snacks/beverages laced with black rock salt; (ii) drinking of untreated ground water; (iii) using fluoridated toothpaste. The duration of recovery varies from patient to patient depending upon their body physiology and the seriousness with which the interventions were practiced. Recurrence of the disease may occur in some patients due to change in life-style, not practicing interventions, entry of fluoride inadvertentl.
unication provides an overview of Fluorosis, its occurrence, manifestations, diagnostic tests, results, interventions practiced, monitoring and recovery from the diseas.
on of coronary and renal disease has been frequently found in epidemiological studies. Whether ECG-graphic presentation of myocardial infarction [S-T Elevated MI (STEMI) or Non S-T Elevated MI (NSTEMI)] is related to the degree of renal dysfunction is still unclea.
ed 146 patients with acute myocardial infarction, consecutively entering the Coronary Care Unit of our ward. At entry, patients underwent clinical, ECG-graphic and echocardiographic examination, and blood samples were withdrawn for cardiac markers and general biochemistry. GFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. STEMI was found in 71 cases and NSTEMI in 75 cases. Renal function was normal in 61 patients (stage 1), mildly impaired (&lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) in 60 (stage 2) and moderately to severely impaired (GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) in 25 cases (stages 3-4). Patients were, thereafter, clustered into two groups (stages 1-2 and stages 3-4). Compared to stage 1-2 subjects, stages 3-4 patients were older, were more likely to be diabetic and had more frequently previous cardiovascular diseases. The probability of presentation of NSTEMI for stage 3-4 patients was 4-fold greater than for stage 1-2 patients (p = 0.02.
a support the evidence that 1) NSTEMI is associated with more severe kidney dysfunction, likely due to more severe and/or longer lasting exposition to risk factors; 2) cardiac and renal impairment are strongly associated. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT0163642.
ighly potent and broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against HIV have recently been isolated from B cells of infected individuals. However, the effects of these antibodies on the persistent viral reservoirs in HIV-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) are unknown. We show that several HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies--in particular, PGT121, VRC01, and VRC03--potently inhibited entry into CD4(+) T cells of HIV isolated from the latent viral reservoir of infected individuals whose plasma viremia was well controlled by ART. In addition, we demonstrate that HIV replication in autologous CD4(+) T cells derived from infected individuals receiving ART was profoundly suppressed by three aforementioned and other HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies. These findings have implications for passive immunotherapy as an approach toward controlling plasma viral rebound in patients whose ART is withdraw.

te the long-term efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol (CZP) plus methotrexate treatment and to assess the efficacy of two CZP maintenance dosing schedules in Japanese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with an inadequate response to methotrexat.
ouble-blind patients were entered into an open-label extension (OLE) study. Patients withdrawn due to lack of efficacy at 16 weeks and double-blind completers without a week-24 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response received CZP 200 mg every other week (Q2W) plus methotrexate. Double-blind completers with week-24 ACR20 responses were randomized to CZP 200 mg Q2W plus methotrexate or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks plus methotrexat.
/ACR50/ACR70 response rates of double-blind completers (n = 204) were 89.7%/67.2%/36.3% at OLE entry and 95.6%/84.8%/58.3% at 52 weeks, respectively. Other clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes were sustained with long-term CZP plus methotrexate. Long-term treatment with CZP was well-tolerated with no new unexpected adverse events observed. The efficacy and safety of CZP treatment were similar between the two dosing schedule.
 CZP administration with methotrexate maintained efficacy over 52 weeks and was well-tolerated for Japanese RA patients. No obvious differences in clinical efficacy and safety were observed between the two dosing schedules, giving flexibility in maintenance administration schedule.
omplications following cervical epidural steroid injection are rare. Subdural injection of local anesthetic and steroid represents a rare but potentially life threatening complication. A patient presented with left sided cervical pain radiating into the left upper extremity with motor deficit. MRI showed absent lordosis with a broad left paramedian disc-osteophyte complex impinging the spinal cord at C5-6. During C5-6 transforaminal epidural steroid injection contrast in AP fluoroscopic view demonstrated a subdural contrast pattern. The needle was withdrawn slightly and repositioned. Normal lateral epidural and nerve root contrast pattern was subsequently obtained and injection followed with immediate improvement in radicular symptoms. There were no postoperative complications on subsequent clinic follow-up. The subdural space is a potential space between the arachnoid and dura mater. As the subdural space is larger in the cervical region, there may be an elevated potential for inadvertent subdural injection. Needle placement in the cervical subdural space during transforaminal injection is uncommon. Failure to identify aberrant needle entry within the cervical subdural space may result in life threatening complications. We recommend initial injection of a limited volume of contrast agent to detect inadvertent subdural space placemen.

Patients withdrawn at 16 weeks due to lack of efficacy and DB completers without a 24-week American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response received CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W). DB completers with 24-week ACR20 responses were randomized to CZP 200 mg Q2W or CZP 400 mg every 4 week.
/ACR50/ACR70 response rates of DB completers (n = 98) were 82.7%/56.1%/34.7% at OLE entry, and 83.7%/65.3%/48.0% at 52 weeks, respectively. Other clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes were sustained during long-term administration of CZP, even without MTX. No new unexpected adverse events were observed during long-term CZP treatment. The efficacy and safety of CZP treatment were similar between the two dosing schedule.
 CZP administration is efficacious and safe for RA patients. No obvious differences in clinical efficacy and safety were observed between the two dosing schedules. The choice between two maintenace regimens adds flexibility in administration schedules for RA patients and physician.
east cells that enter the developmental path of meiosis do not commit to finishing meiosis until after prophase I and the realization of such meiosis-specific events as pairing of homologous chromosomes and initiation of recombination. If the meiosis-inducing signal is withdrawn prior to commitment, cells exit meiosis and return to mitosis. The timing of this transition poses a singular problem for maintaining genome integrity. Cells in meiotic prophase have already replicated their DNA, but they have not undergone the morphological changes intrinsic to mitosis, including budding. Successful re-entry into mitosis requires that these cells bud but not rereplicate their DNA, reversing the normal order of mitosis. This study focuses on the cellular mechanisms that permit this dramatically altered order of cell-cycle event.
ping a microfluidics assay to monitor individual cells, we show that the successful transition from meiotic prophase to mitosis requires the modulation of Cdk1 activity to coordinate cell-cycle events. The S. cerevisiae Wee1 homolog Swe1 prevents the formation of multinucleate cells by restraining M phase CDK activity to allow bud formation prior to nuclear division. The remaining S phase CDK activity promotes bud formation and prevents origin licensing so that DNA cannot rereplicate between bud formation and nuclear division. Once a bud has formed, M phase CDK drives cells through a normal mitotic divisio.
 uncovers the essential requirement of Swe1 to modulate CDK activity to coordinate cell-cycle events and maintain genome integrity during the transition from meiotic prophase to mitosi.

ption of medication that was withdrawn after the occurrence of an adverse drug event (including allergy), is a recognized medication safety issue on a patient level. We performed a systematic review to identify systems (electronic and nonelectronic) that can prevent the represcription of drugs withdrawn because of an adverse drug event and the effects of these systems. The review was performed using PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines. PubMed and Embase were searched for articles describing systems that can prevent represcription of drugs that had been withdrawn for causing an adverse drug event. Information on the characteristics of the studies, systems, and if present results achieved with such systems, was extracted. The results showed that of 6793 articles screened, 137 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. A total of 45 studies describing 33 systems (28 electronic) were included. The five nonelectronic systems used allergy bracelets or allergy labels on hospital medical records or on drug orders. Systems differed in the way adverse drug events were documented and how users were alerted to drug represcription. Most systems functioned within a specific healthcare setting. Of 12 studies that compared pre- and post-intervention periods or wards with and without intervention, 7 showed a reduction in represcription after adverse drug event. In conclusion, several systems have been developed that can prevent the represcription of drugs that elicited an adverse drug event, but the evidence that these systems are effective is limite.
emperament is associated with risk for the development of social anxiety disorder in childhood; however, not all fearful children become anxious. Identifying maladaptive trajectories is thus important for clarifying which fearful children are at risk. In an unselected sample of 111 two-year-olds (55% male, 95% Caucasian), Buss ( 2011 ) identified a pattern of fearful behavior, dysregulated fear, characterized by high fear in low threat situations. This pattern of behavior predicted parent- and teacher-reported withdrawn/anxious behaviors in preschool and at kindergarten entry. The current study extended original findings and examined whether dysregulated fear predicted observed social wariness with adults and peers, and social anxiety symptoms at age 6. We also examined prosocial adjustment during kindergarten as a moderator of the link between dysregulated fear and social wariness. Consistent with predictions, children with greater dysregulated fear at age 2 were more socially wary of adults and unfamiliar peers in the laboratory, were reported as having more social anxiety symptoms, and were nearly 4 times more likely to manifest social anxiety symptoms than other children with elevated wariness in kindergarten. Results demonstrated stability in the dysregulated fear profile and increased risk for social anxiety symptom development. Dysregulated fear predicted more social wariness with unfamiliar peers only when children became less prosocial during kindergarten. Findings are discussed in relation to the utility of the dysregulated fear construct for specifying maladaptive trajectories of risk for anxiety disorder developmen.

f 445 patients were randomized to the study. After randomization, 54 patients were withdrawn; 30 because of a positive MRSA screen at study entry, 11 due to lack of consent, 11 were inappropriately randomized and 2 had adverse reactions. Thirty-nine (10%) patients developed new MRSA colonization (JBS n = 22, 11.2%; TTO body wash n = 17, 8.7%). The difference in percentage colonized (2.5%, 95% CI - 8.95 to 3.94; P = 0.50) was not significant. The mean maximum increase in sequential organ failure assessment score was not significant (JBS 1.44, SD 1.92; TTO body wash 1.28, SD 1.79; P = 0.85) and no study patients developed MRSA bacteraemi.
with JBS, TTO body wash cannot be recommended as an effective means of reducing MRSA colonizatio.
rial lead implantation in the left ventricle or aorta is a rare complication. Percutaneous lead removal is associated with significant thromboembolic and bleeding risk. We present two cases of lead removal from the left ventricle via the left subclavian artery with concurrent carotid embolic protection followed by stent graft placement in the subclavian arter.
 underwent prior pacemaker implant with atrial and ventricular active fixation leads positioned in the right coronary cusp and the left ventricle, respectively. Patient 2 had prior ICD implant with a single active fixation lead positioned in the left ventricular apex. Lead removal was performed in a hybrid operating room. Distal embolic filter wires were deployed in the carotid arteries following anticoagulation. Intravascular ultrasound of the left subclavian artery was performed and as the leads were withdrawn, a covered stent was deployed at the removal site. Final angiography demonstrated no evidence of embolic phenomena. Both patients underwent transvenous lead implantation followed by an uneventful postoperative clinical cours.
rial percutaneous lead removal may be safely performed using embolic filter protection of the cerebral circulation and stent graft placement of the arterial entry sit.
oma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis and a very limited response to treatment. The current standard of care for GBM usually consists of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide, although resistance to this drug is common. The predominant mechanism of action of temozolomide is methylation of guanine residues although this can be reversed by methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) as well as other DNA repair systems. The presence of methylguanine causes abortive DNA synthesis with subsequent apoptosis. This suggests that the closer a particular cell is to S phase when it is exposed to temozolomide the more likely it is to die since repair enzymes will have had less time to reverse the damage. T type calcium channel inhibitors can stop the entry of extracellular calcium that is necessary for transit past the G1/S boundary. As a result, T type calcium channel blockers can slow the growth of cancer cells, but do not generally kill them. Though slowing the growth of cancer cells is important in its own right, it also provides a therapeutic strategy in which a T type channel blocker is administered then withdrawn followed by the administration of temozolomide. We show here that imposing this cell cycle restriction increases the efficacy of subsequently administered temozolomide in immunodeficient mice bearing various human GBM xenograft lines. We also present data that MGMT expressing GBM tumors, which are temozolomide resistant, may be rendered more sensitive by this strateg.
nitiation of germ cells at 13.5 dpc (days post-coitus) indicates female sex determination in mice. Recent studies reveal that mesonephroi-derived retinoic acid (RA) is the key signal for induction of meiosis. However, whether the mesonephroi is dispensable for meiosis is unclear and the role of the ovary in this meiotic process remains to be clarified. This study provides data that RA derived from fetal ovaries is sufficient to induce germ cell meiosis in a fetal ovary culture system. When fetal ovaries were collected from 11.5 to 13.5 dpc fetuses, isolated and cultured in vitro, germ cells enter meiosis in the absence of mesonephroi. To exclude RA sourcing from mesonephroi, 11.5 dpc urogenital ridges (UGRs; mesonephroi and ovary complexes) were treated with diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) to block retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) activity in the mesonephros and the ovary. Meiosis occurred when DEAB was withdrawn and the mesonephros was removed 2 days later. Furthermore, RALDH1, rather than RALDH2, serves as the major RA synthetase in UGRs from 12.5 to 15.5 dpc. DEAB treatment to the ovary alone was able to block germ cell meiotic entry. We also found that exogenously supplied RA dose-dependently reduced germ cell numbers in ovaries by accelerating the entry into meiosis. These results suggest that ovary-derived RA is responsible for meiosis initiatio.
inal fluid (CSF) has been considered as a preferential pathway of circulation for immune cells during neuroimmune surveillance. In order to evaluate the involvement of CSF-filled spaces in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis, we performed a time-course analysis of immune cell association with the CSF-containing ventricles, velae, and cisterns in two active models of this diseas.
g spinal cord homogenate-induced EAE in rat and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE in mouse were used. Leukocyte distribution and phenotypes were investigated by immunohistochemistry in serial sections of brain areas of interest, as well as in CSF withdrawn from rat. Immune cells associated with the choroid plexuses were quantifie.
adjuvant-induced peripheral inflammation in the absence of brain antigen led to a subtle but definite increase in the number of myeloid cells in the extraventricular CSF spaces. In both rats and mice, EAE was characterized by a sustained and initial infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes within forebrain/midbrain fluid-filled compartments such as the velum interpositum and ambient cisterns, and certain basal cisterns. Leukocytes further infiltrated periventricular and pericisternal parenchymal areas, along perivascular spaces or following a downward CSF-to-tissue gradient. Cells quantified in CSF sampled from rats included lymphocytes and neutrophils. The distinctive pattern of cell distribution suggests that both the choroid plexus and the vessels lying in the velae and cisterns are gates for early leukocyte entry in the central nervous system. B-cell infiltration observed in the mouse model was restricted to CSF-filled extraventricular compartment.
ults identified distinctive velae and cisterns of the forebrain and midbrain as preferential sites of immune cell homing following peripheral and early central inflammation and point to a role of CSF in directing brain invasion by immune cells during EA.
erformed a pilot study of MDR-1 gene transfer in patients receiving CD34-selected peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant for lymphoma. To ensure minimum engraftment thresholds and facilitate CD34 purification, mobilisation of &gt; 2 x 10(6) CD34 cells/kg was a condition for recruitment. Of 11 patients counselled for study entry, only five achieved this target in a single apheresis. In three consenting patients, purified CD34 cells were exposed to A12M1 MDR-1 retroviral supernatant for 6 h, cryopreserved then thawed and readministered following ablative chemotherapy. No delay in engraftment was observed, although one patient received additional back-up cells. Gene transfer was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for vector-derived MDR-1 cDNA sequence in all cases. Analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells after transplant has, however, shown no evidence of in vivo gene transfer with a follow-up of 12, 15 and 18 months. The effect of MDR-1 substrate drugs has not yet been tested as all patients remain in clinical and radiological remission of their lymphoma. These results confirm the difficulty of achieving in vivo gene transfer in human haemopoietic cells and indicate major logistical constraints in PBSC mobilisation in patients with relapsed and resistant disease in whom initial studies are appropriat.
ly reported that in stroma-free cultures 11-33% of clonogenic cells derived from a bulk long-term culture [long-term culture-clonogenic cells (LTC-CC)] could be transduced by supernatant exposure or coculture of human CD34+ progenitors with MDR retroviral producer line A12M1. We reasoned that a stromal cell layer may generate niches in which LTC-CC could enter in the S-phase, thus becoming a more accessible target for gene delivery. In static culture studies in flasks, human engineered stromal cell line L87/4 or stromal murine M2-10B4 cells were used as feeder after irradiation, and CD34+ cells from either cord blood or peripheral blood of mobilized cancer patients were exposed to MDR supernatant for 7 consecutive days before 5-week culture for LTC-CC evaluation. In continuous flow perfusion culture studies, CD34+ cells were seeded over irradiated stromal murine M2-1OB4 cells and exposed to MDR supernatant for 7 days before LTC-CC evaluation. In mock-transduced controls, &lt;5% of LTC-CC were found to he viable after exposure to 10 ng/ml Taxol. In cells exposed to MDR supernatant in static stroma cultures, 68 +/- 4% of seeded LTC-CC were found to be drug resistant and express MDR mRNA as evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR analysis of single colonies. The addition of cytokines did not further enhance transfer efficiency. After MDR retroviral exposure in continuous flow cultures, 88 +/- 5% of LTC-CC were found to be drug resistant (P &lt; 0.01 versus static stroma culture). P-glycoprotein expression in CD34+ cells was evaluated using flow cytometry and found to he higher after continuous flow versus static cultures. Finally, very high levels of P-glycoprotein expression after MDR supernatant exposure in the presence of stroma were confirmed by APAAP staining of cultured cells. We conclude that engineered stromal cell layers and continuous flow culture conditions can significantly enhance retroviral-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic progenitor cell.
 publication of the PROSPECT (Predictors of Response to CRT) trial, the use of echocardiography for the assessment of mechanical dyssynchrony and as a possible aid for selecting patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy has been heavily criticized. Calls have been made to observe the current guidelines and implant according to the entry criteria of recent major trials. However, although this approach is currently to be recommended, the attempt to identify patients who will not receive the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy and whose clinical condition may be worsened should continue. Devices are not analogous to drugs: initial costs are higher, complications are significant, and the device cannot readily be withdrawn. Professional resources and the costs to society are high and wasted if devices are implanted inappropriately. Rather that discarding the attempt to identify the most suitable patients pre-operatively, further work is needed to refine the techniques and new clinical trials performed. A combination of methods that include finding the site of latest mechanical activation, myocardial scar localization, and assessing venous anatomy pre-operatively may help to identify those who will not derive any benefit or be potentially worsene.
sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) is purified from the fresh roots of Angelica sinensis (AS). This traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years for treating gynecological diseases and used in functional foods for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, such as inflammation and cancer. The antitumor activity of ASP is related to its biological activities, because it suppresses a variety of pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic factors that are dramatically expressed in cancer cells of given types. In this study, we show that angelica sinensis polysaccharide induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells of T47D over-expressing the Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), inducing apoptosis-related signaling pathway activity. The result also found that ASP caused cell death was linked to caspase activity, accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. We found that ASP significantly affected the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax), Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and apoptotic protease activating facter-1 (Apaf1) protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. DAPI staining and Flow cytometry were used to analyze apoptosis. The nude mice xenograft model was used to evaluate the antitumor effect of ASP in vivo. ASP has profound antitumor effect on T47D cells, probably by inducing apoptosis through CREB signaling pathway. Thus, these results suggest that ASP would be a promising therapeutic agent for breast cance.
pocampal neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the mouse hippocampus, and plays roles in learning and memory progresses. In amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice, a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), severe impairment of neurogenesis in the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG has been reported. Osthole, an active constituent of Cnidium monnieri (L.) CUSSON, has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects and may promote neural stem cell proliferation. However, whether osthole ameliorates spatial memory deficits and improves hippocampal neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice remains unknown. In this study we found that osthole (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) once daily) treatment dramatically ameliorated the cognitive impairments by Morris Water Maze test and passive avoidance test, and augmented neurogenesis in the DG of hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, osthole treatment upregulated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) following increased phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), indicating that osthole improves neurogenesis via stimulating BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling in APP/PS1 transgenic mic.
rosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced protein&nbsp;1 (TNFAIP1) was originally identified as a protein involved in DNA replication, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and the progression of certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, forskolin, a stimulant of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), was found to significantly reduce human TNFAIP1 mRNA levels and TNFAIP1 promoter activity in the SKNSH&nbsp;human neuroblastoma cell line as indicated by polymerase chain reaction analysis and a luciferase reporter assay. The association between transcription factor cAMP response element&#8209;binding protein (CREB) and TNFAIP1 was further investigated using loss- and gain of function-studies with western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assays. The CREB-specific inhibitor KG&#8209;501 significantly increased TNFAIP1 protein levels, while overexpression of wild&#8209;type CREB, but not CREB mutated at ser133a or its DNA-binding site, significantly decreased human TNFAIP1 protein levels and TNFAIP1 promoter activity in SKNSH&nbsp;cells. Furthermore, two CRE sites located at &#8209;285 and &#8209;425&nbsp;bp of the human TNFAIP1 promoter were identified to be responsible for CREB&#8209;induced inhibition of human TNFAIP1 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that CREB bound to the TNFAIP1 promoter region harboring these two CRE sites. A further luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that CREB phosphorylation on ser133 was responsible for forskolin&#8209;induced inhibition of TNFAIP1 expression. In conclusion, the present study suggested that CREB is a negative regulator of the TNFAIP1 gen.
f evidence that increased consumption of epicatechin (E) and quercetin (Q) may reduce the risk of stroke, we have measured the effects of combining E and Q on mitochondrial function and neuronal survival following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Relative to mouse cortical neuron cultures pretreated (24h) with either E or Q (0.1-10μM), E+Q synergistically attenuated OGD-induced neuronal cell death. E, Q and E+Q (0.3μM) increased spare respiratory capacity but only E+Q (0.3μM) preserved this crucial parameter of neuronal mitochondrial function after OGD. These improvements were accompanied by corresponding increases in cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and the expression of CREB-target genes that promote neuronal survival (Bcl-2) and mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α). Consistent with these findings, E+Q (0.1 and 1.0μM) elevated mitochondrial gene expression (MT-ND2 and MT-ATP6) to a greater extent than E or Q after OGD. Q (0.3-3.0μM), but not E (3.0μM), elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) spikes and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, E and E+Q (0.1 and 0.3μM), but not Q (0.1 and 0.3μM), activated protein kinase B (Akt). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (1.0μM) blocked neuroprotection by E (0.3μM) or Q (1.0μM). Oral administration of E+Q (75mg/kg; once daily for 5days) reduced hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. These findings suggest E and Q activate Akt- and Ca(2+)-mediated signaling pathways that converge on NOS and CREB resulting in synergistic improvements in neuronal mitochondrial performance which confer profound protection against ischemic injur.
y aimed to chemically isolate and explore an antimelanogenesis inducer in extracts of Solanum melongena L. &quot;Usukawamarunasu&quot; eggplant. We successfully identified dioscin ([25R]-Spirost-5-en-3β-yl) 2-O-(6-deoxy-α-l-mannopyranosyl) - 4-O-(6-deoxy-α-l-mannopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside] in the plant, and examined the effects of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)-induced melanogenesis in B16 murine melanoma cells by this plant-derived dioscin. Immunoblot analysis suggested that dioscin reduced the expression of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), and TRP-2, resulting in inhibition of intracellular production of melanin. In addition, dioscin caused reduction of phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 transcription factors (CREB), which led to a reduction of microphthalmia-related transcription factor (MITF) in α-MSH-stimulated cells, but did not affect phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Furthermore, dioscin significantly downregulated the expression of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2, which led to the reduction of α-MSH-induced melanogenesis in B16 cells. These results suggest that dioscin may decrease the level of MITF via inhibition of phosphorylation of CREB in α-MSH-induced melanogenesis in B16 cell.
ine transporter (DAT) protein, a component of the dopamine system, undergoes adaptive neurobiological changes from drug abuse. Prevention of relapse and reduction of withdrawal symptoms are still the major limitations in the current pharmacological treatments of drug addiction. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of essential oils extracted from Elsholtzia ciliata, Shinchim, Angelicae gigantis Radix, and Eugenia caryophyllata, well-known traditional Korean medicines for addiction, on the modulation of dopamine system in amphetamine-treated cells and to explore the possible mechanism underlying its therapeutic effect. The potential cytotoxic effect of essential oils was evaluated in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells using cell viability assays. Quantification of DAT, p-CREB, p-MAPK, and p-Akt was done by immunoblotting. DAT was significantly reduced in cells treated with 50 μM of amphetamine in a time-dependent manner. No significant toxicity of essential oils from Elsholtzia ciliata and Shinchim was observed at doses of 10, 25, and 50 μg/mL. However, essential oils from A. gigantis Radix at a dose of 100 μg/mL and E. caryophyllata at doses of 50 and 100 μg/mL showed cytotoxicity. Treatment with GBR 12909, a highly selective DAT inhibitor, significantly increased DAT expression compared with that of amphetamine only by enhancing phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Akt. In addition, essential oils effectively induced hyperphosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), MAPK, and Akt, which resulted in DAT upregulation. Our study implies that the essential oils may rehabilitate brain dopamine function through increased DAT availability in abstinent former drug user.
like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based drugs are being used to achieve better glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes, and GLP-1 mimetics such as liraglutide have shown therapeutic potential in preventing diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular complications as well as comorbidities such as neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we investigated the effects of liraglutide on primary rat cortical astrocytes treated with advanced glycation end-products (AGEs.
protein expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR, western blots, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The caspase-3 activity was assessed using a caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit. The ROS production was measured with CM-H2DCFDA staining. The cell viability of rat astrocytes was determined using MTT assa.
de ameliorated AGEs-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine secretion, caspase activation, and cell death in astrocytes, and reversed the AGEs mediated reduction in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein. The protective effects of liraglutide against AGEs-mediated toxicity were abolished by GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) knockdown or pretreatment of cells with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 or the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAM.

e protein phosphorylation at serine (Ser), threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues is among the major regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells. The eukaryotic genome encodes many protein kinases and protein phosphatases. However, the localization, activity and specificity towards phosphatase substrates are dictated by a large array of phosphatase binding and regulatory subunits. For protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) more than 200 binding subunits have been described. The various PP1 isoforms and the binding subunits can be located throughout the cell, including in the nucleus. It follows that several nuclear specific PP1 binding proteins (PIPs) have been described and these will be discussed. Among them are PNUTS (phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit), NIPP1 (nuclear inhibitor of PP1) and CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein), which have all been associated with transcription. In fact PP1 can associate with transcription factors fulfilling an important regulatory function, in this respect it can bind to Hox11, human factor C1 (HCF1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2). PP1 also regulates cell cycle progression and centrosome maturation and splitting, again by binding to specific regulatory proteins. Moreover, PP1 together with other protein phosphatases control the entry into mitosis by regulating the activity of mitotic kinases. Thus, PP1, its binding proteins and/or the phosphorylation states of both, directly control a vast array of cell nucleus associated functions, many of which are starting to be unravele.
c AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a signal-dependent transcription factor that exerts its positive effects on gene transcription of a broad range of genes by recruiting coactivators, including CREB-binding protein (CBP), its paralog, p300, and the family of CRTC (CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators) proteins. Whereas recruitment of CBP/p300 is dependent on CREB phosphorylation at Ser133, recruitment of CRTCs is not. Here we describe how both mechanisms could concurrently drive transcription of CREB targets in a subset of head and neck cancers featuring chromosomal translocations that fuse portions of CRTC1 and CRTC3 genes with that of the Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator MAML2. We show that a peptide derived from transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) of MAML2 binds to the CBP KIX domain with micromolar affinity. An ∼20-residue segment within this peptide, conserved in MAML2 orthologs and paralogs, binds directly to a KIX surface previously shown to bind to MLL1. The 20-residue MAML2 segment shares sequence similarity with MLL1, especially at those positions in direct contact with KIX, and like MLL1, the segment is characterized by the presence of an ∼10-residue helix. Because CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion proteins are constitutively nuclear, like CREB, our results suggest constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300 to CREB targets that could be further enhanced by signals that cause CREB Ser133 phosphorylatio.
s an alkaloid found only in Herba leonuri and it has been reported to possess considerable neuroprotective effects in animal models of ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that 3-month oral SCM-198 treatment could significantly improve both recognition and spatial memory, inhibit microgliosis and promote neuronal survival in amyloid-β protein precursor and presenilin-1(AβPP/PS1) double-transgenic mice without affecting amyloid-β (Aβ) burden. In addition, decreases in cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) phosphorylation were attenuated by SCM-198 both in vivo and in primary cortical neurons, which could be blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of upstream PKA in enhancing the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling by SCM-198. Our results indicate that SCM-198, a drug that could promote neuronal survival and enhance BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling, has beneficial effects on behavioral and biochemical alterations without affecting Aβ burden in AβPP/PS1 mice and might become a potential drug candidate for AD treatment in the futur.
ly expressed CD59 is the sole membrane complement regulatory protein that protects host cells from complement damage by restricting membrane attack complex assembly. The human gene encodes a single CD59, whereas the mouse gene encodes a duplicated CD59, comprising mCd59a and mCd59b, with distinct tissue distribution. Recently, we revealed that Sp1 regulates constitutive CD59 transcription and that canonical nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) regulate inducible CD59 transcription. However, the mechanisms that underlie mCd59 regulation remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that Sp1 controls broadly distributed mCd59a expression, whereas serum response factor (SRF) and canonical NF-κB regulate selectively expressed mCd59b. Tumor necrosis factor-α in vitro and lipopolysaccharide in vivo remarkably enhance the expression of mCd59b but not mCd59a by activating SRF and NF-κB, thus protecting cells from complement attack. In addition, cAMP analog treatment also dramatically increases mCd59b but not mCd59a expression in a manner independent of CREB, SRF and NF-κB. Therefore, mCd59b but not mCd59a may be the responder to external inflammatory stimuli and may have an important role in complement-mediated mouse models of disease.Genes and Immunity advance online publication, 23 July 2015; doi:10.1038/gene.2015.2.
lp stem cells (DPSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells capable of differentiating along the osteoblast, adipocyte, and chondrocyte lineages. Regulating differentiation of DPSCs may be a useful tool for regenerative medicine and cell-based therapy in oral diseases. Multisignaling pathways are involved in osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Recent studies show that cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling could stimulate the expression of genes such as bone morphogenic proteins 2 (BMP2), inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2), bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and type XXIV collagen, which have been implicated in osteogenesis and bone formation. Activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3, gene name G-protein signaling modulator-1, Gpsm1), an accessory protein for G-protein signaling, plays an important role in regulating the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB). However, the involvement of AGS3 in osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs has not been explored. Our data indicated that increased expression of AGS3 would inhibit osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs exposed to inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) via cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling. The negative role of AGS3 in osteogenic differentiation was further confirmed by knocking down and over expression of AGS3. Our findings may provide clinical implications for osteoporosi.
ed evidence suggests that enhanced neurogenesis stimulated by ischemic injury contributes to stroke outcome. However, it is unclear whether hyperglycemia, which is frequently tested positive in patients with acute ischemic stroke, influences stroke-induced neurogenesis. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of hyperglycemia on stroke-induced neurogenesis in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. For this purpose, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (220-250g) were subjected to 90min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Glucose was administered during ischemia to produce target blood levels ranging from 4.83±0.94mM (normoglycemia) to 20.76±1.56mM. To label proliferating cells in ischemic ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) of lateral ventricles, 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected 24h after MCAO. Brains were harvested 2h post-BrdU to evaluate the effects of hyperglycemia on infarct volume and SVZ cell proliferation. Rats that were severely hyperglycemic (19.26±1.48mM to 20.76±1.56mM) during ischemia had 24.26% increase in infarct volume (P&lt;0.05) and more serious neurological function deficits (P&lt;0.05). The severe hyperglycemic rats also showed dramatically decreased proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) (P&lt;0.05) and down-regulation of the phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) (P&lt;0.05)and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (P&lt;0.05) in ipsilateral SVZ. But the above-mentioned detrimental effects were not observed in rats that were rendered with mild hyperglycemia (9.43±1.39-10.13±1.24mM). Our findings indicate that severe instead of mild hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic injury and inhibits stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis by a mechanism involving suppression of CREB and BDNF signalin.
ol, a natural polyphenolic compound found in foods and beverages, has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its potent chemopreventive and anti-tumor effects. In this study, the effects of resveratrol on the expression of P-glycoprotein/multi-drug resistance protein 1 (P-gp/MDR1), and the underlying molecular mechanisms, were investigated in oxaliplatin (L-OHP)-resistant colorectal cancer cells (HCT116/L-OHP). Resveratrol downregulated MDR1 protein and mRNA expression levels and reduced MDR1 promoter activity. It also enhanced the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123, suggesting that resveratrol can reverse multi-drug resistance by downregulating MDR1 expression and reducing drug efflux. Resveratrol treatment also reduced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity, reduced phosphorylation levels of IκBα, and reduced nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65. Moreover, downregulation of MDR1 expression and promoter activity was mediated by resveratrol-induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. The inhibitory effects of resveratrol on MDR1 expression and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation were reversed by AMPKα siRNA transfection. We found that the transcriptional activity of cAMP-responsive element (CRE) was inhibited by resveratrol. These results demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on MDR1 expression in HCT116/L-OHP cells were closely associated with the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and CREB activation in an AMPK-dependent manne.
hemic stroke is a cerebrovascular accident and it is the most common cause of physical disabilities around the globe. Patients may present with repeated ictuses, experiencing mental consequences, such as depression and cognitive disorders. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a kinase that is involved in neurotransmission and plasticity, but its dysregulation contributes to cognitive disorders and dementia. Gene therapy targeting CDK5 was administered to the right hippocampus of ischemic rats during transient cerebral middle artery occlusion. Physiologic parameters (blood pressure, pH, pO2, and pCO2) were measured. The CDK5 downregulation resulted in neurologic and motor improvement during the first week after ischemia. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 RNA interference (RNAi) prevented dysfunctions in learning, memory, and reversal learning at 1 month after ischemia. These observations were supported by the prevention of neuronal loss, the reduction of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunoreactivity, and a decrease in astroglial and microglia hyperreactivities and tauopathy. Additionally, CDK5 silencing led to an increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its Tropomyosin Receptor kinase B (TRKB) receptor, and activation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are important targets in neuronal plasticity. Together, our findings suggest that gene therapy based on CDK5 silencing prevents cerebral ischemia-induced neurodegeneration and motor and cognitive deficits.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism advance online publication, 24 June 2015; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2015.15.
's disease (AD) is one of the common neurodegenerative diseases and amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to be a key molecule contributing to AD pathology. Recently, curcumin is supposed to be beneficial to AD treatment. This study investigates the inhibitory effects of curcumin on Aβ-induced cell damage and death involving NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) elevation in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were impaired significantly in Aβ-damaged group compared with the control group, and cell viability was decreased while the released LDH from the cytosol was increased. Curcumin promotes cell growth and decreases cell impairment induced by Aβ. Curcmin attenuates Aβ-induced elevation of the ratio of cellular glutamate/γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with a concentration-dependent manner. Curcumin inhibits Aβ-induced increase of cellular Ca(2+) and depresses Aβ-induced phosphorylations of both NMDA receptor and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1). These results indicated that curcumin inhibits Aβ-induced neuronal damage and cell death involving the prevention from intracellular Ca(2+) elevation mediated by the NMDA recepto.
is a hyperglycemic pancreatic hormone that has been shown to provide a beneficial effect against asthmatic bronchospasm. We investigated the role of this hormone on airway smooth muscle contraction and lung inflammation using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The action of glucagon on mouse cholinergic tracheal contraction was studied in a conventional organ bath system, and its effect on airway obstruction was also investigated using the whole-body pletysmographic technique in mice. We also tested the effect of glucagon on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and inflammation. The expression of glucagon receptor (GcgR), CREB, phospho-CREB, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-3, pNOS-3 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 was evaluated by western blot, while prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and tumour necrosis factor-α were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassay and ELISA respectively. Glucagon partially inhibited carbachol-induced tracheal contraction in a mechanism clearly sensitive to des-His1-[Glu9]-glucagon amide, a GcgR antagonist. Remarkably, GcgR was more expressed in the lung and trachea with intact epithelium than in the epithelium-denuded trachea. In addition, the glucagon-mediated impairment of carbachol-induced contraction was prevented by either removing epithelial cells or blocking NOS (L-NAME), COX (indomethacin) or COX-1 (SC-560). In contrast, inhibitors of either heme oxygenase or COX-2 were inactive. Intranasal instillation of glucagon inhibited methacholine-induced airway obstruction by a mechanism sensitive to pretreatment with L-NAME, indomethacin and SC-560. Glucagon induced CREB and NOS-3 phosphorylation and increased PGE₂ levels in the lung tissue without altering COX-1 expression. Glucagon also inhibited LPS-induced AHR and bronchoalveolar inflammation. These findings suggest that glucagon possesses airway-relaxing properties that are mediated by epithelium-NOS-3-NO- and COX-1-PGE₂-dependent mechanism.
l 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (ABG-001) is a lead compound derived from neuritogenic gentisides. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which ABG-001 induces neurite outgrowth in a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12). Inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 significantly decreased ABG-001-induced neurite outgrowth. Western blot analysis revealed that ABG-001 significantly induced phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor, protein kinase B (Akt), ERK, and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB). These effects were markedly reduced by addition of the corresponding inhibitors. We also found that ABG-001-induced neurite outgrowth was reduced by protein kinase C inhibitor as well as small-interfering RNA against the IGF-1 receptor. Furthermore, like ABG-001, IGF-1 also induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, and low-dose nerve growth factor augmented the observed effects of ABG-001 on neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that ABG-001 targets the IGF-1 receptor and activates PI3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and their downstream signaling cascades to induce neurite outgrowt.
nce in molecular signaling cascades and transcriptional regulation in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors, is implicated in the behavioral responses to psychostimulants. To provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms occurring in MSN subtypes by cocaine, we examined the transcription factor early growth response 3 (Egr3). We evaluated Egr3 because it is a target of critical cocaine-mediated signaling pathways and because Egr3-binding sites are found on promoters of key cocaine-associated molecules. We first used a RiboTag approach to obtain ribosome-associated transcriptomes from each MSN subtype and found that repeated cocaine administration induced Egr3 ribosome-associated mRNA in NAc D1-MSNs while reducing Egr3 in D2-MSNs. Using Cre-inducible adeno-associated viruses combined with D1-Cre and D2-Cre mouse lines, we observed that Egr3 overexpression in D1-MSNs enhances rewarding and locomotor responses to cocaine, whereas overexpression in D2-MSNs blunts these behaviors. miRNA knock-down of Egr3 in MSN subtypes produced opposite behavioral responses from those observed with overexpression. Finally, we found that repeated cocaine administration altered Egr3 binding to promoters of genes that are important for cocaine-mediated cellular and behavioral plasticity. Genes with increased Egr3 binding to promoters, Camk2α, CREB, FosB, Nr4a2, and Sirt1, displayed increased mRNA in D1-MSNs and, in some cases, a reduction in D2-MSNs. Histone and the DNA methylation enzymes G9a and Dnmt3a displayed reduced Egr3 binding to their promoters and reduced mRNA in D1-MSNs. Our study provides novel insight into an opposing role of Egr3 in select NAc MSN subtypes in cocaine actio.
esent study, the neuroprotective effect of 5-hydroxy-6,7,4'-trimethoxyflavone (flavone 1), a natural flavone, was investigated in comparison with another flavone, 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone (flavone 2) on the hippocampus of amyloid beta (Aβ)-injected rats. Rats were treated with the 2 flavones (1 mg/kg/d) for 1 week before Aβ injection. Seven days after Aβ administration, memory function of rats was assessed in a passive avoidance test (PAT). Changes in the levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (PGC-1α), phospho-adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (pAMPK), AMPK, phospho-cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), CREB, and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. Our results showed an improvement in memory in rats pretreated with flavonoids. At the molecular level, phosphorylation of CREB, known as the master modulator of memory processes, increased. On the other hand, the level of mitochondrial biogenesis factors, PGC-1α and its downstream molecules NRF-1 and TFAM significantly increased by dietary administration of 2 flavones. In addition, flavone 1 and flavone 2 prevented mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial membrane potential reduction. Our results provided evidence that flavone 1 is more effective than flavone 2 presumably due to its O-methylated groups. In conclusion, it seems that in addition to classical antioxidant effect, flavones exert part of their protective effects through mitochondrial biogenesi.
P response element-binding protein (CREB) contributes to adaptation of mesocorticolimbic networks by modulating activity-regulated transcription and plasticity in neurons. Activity or expression changes of CREB in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and orbital frontal cortex (OFC) interact with behavioral changes during reward-motivated learning. However, these findings from animal models have not been evaluated in humans. We tested whether CREB1 genotypes affect reward-motivated decisions and related brain activation, using BOLD fMRI in 224 young and healthy participants. More specifically, participants needed to adapt their decision to either pursue or resist immediate rewards to optimize the reward outcome. We found significant CREB1 genotype effects on choices to pursue increases of the reward outcome and on BOLD signal in the NAc, OFC, insula cortex, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, and precuneus during these decisions in comparison with those decisions avoiding total reward loss. Our results suggest that CREB1 genotype effects in these regions could contribute to individual differences in reward- and associative memory-based decision-makin.
regulated transcription coactivator CRTC2 stimulates CREB target gene expression and has a well-established role in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we find, unexpectedly, that loss of CRTC2, as well as CREB1 and its coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), results in a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and a resultant increased mutation frequency. We show that CRTC2, CREB1, and CBP are transcriptional activators of well-established MMR genes, including EXO1, MSH6, PMS1, and POLD2. Mining of expression profiling databases and analysis of patient samples reveal that CRTC2 and its target MMR genes are downregulated in specific T cell lymphoma subtypes, which are microsatellite unstable. The levels of acetylated histone H3 on the CRTC2 promoter are significantly reduced in lymphoma in comparison to normal tissue, explaining the decreased CRTC2 expression. Our results establish a role for CRTC2 as a lymphoma tumor suppressor gene that preserves genome integrity by stimulating transcription of MMR gene.
nal strategies are not particularly successful in the treatment of leukaemia, and identification of signalling pathways crucial to the activity of leukaemia stem cells will provide targets for the development of new therapies. Here we report that certain receptors containing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) are crucial for the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Inhibition of expression of the ITIM-containing receptor LAIR1 does not affect normal haematopoiesis but abolishes leukaemia development. LAIR1 induces activation of SHP-1, which acts as a phosphatase-independent signalling adaptor to recruit CAMK1 for activation of downstream CREB in AML cells. The LAIR1-SHP-1-CAMK1-CREB pathway sustains the survival and self-renewal of AML stem cells. Intervention in the signalling initiated by ITIM-containing receptors such as LAIR1 may result in successful treatment of AM.
injury leading to endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic feature of chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and systemic inflammatory conditions, and predisposes to apoptosis and atherogenesis. Thus, endothelial dysfunction represents a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis prevention. The observation that activity of either protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) or haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enhances endothelial cell (EC) resistance to inflammation and apoptosis led us to test the hypothesis that HO-1 is a downstream target of PKC.
n of constitutively active PKCε in human EC significantly increased HO-1 mRNA and protein, whereas conversely aortas or cardiac EC from PKCε-deficient mice exhibited reduced HO-1 when compared with wild-type littermates. Angiotensin II activated PKCε and induced HO-1 via a PKCε-dependent pathway. PKCε activation significantly attenuated TNFα-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and increased resistance to serum starvation-induced apoptosis. These responses were reversed by the HO antagonist zinc protoporphyrin IX. Phosphokinase antibody array analysis identified CREB1((Ser133)) phosphorylation as a PKCε signalling intermediary, and cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) siRNA abrogated PKCε-induced HO-1 up-regulation. Likewise, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) was identified as a PKCε target using nuclear translocation and DNA-binding assays, and Nrf2 siRNA prevented PKCε-mediated HO-1 induction. Moreover, depletion of CREB1 inhibited PKCε-induced Nrf2 DNA binding, suggestive of transcriptional co-operation between CREB1 and Nrf.
vity in the vascular endothelium regulates HO-1 via a pathway requiring CREB1 and Nrf2. Given the potent protective actions of HO-1, we propose that this mechanism is an important contributor to the emerging role of PKCε in the maintenance of endothelial homeostasis and resistance to injur.
ar stress promotes the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) of the developing mouse embryo. We determined that the AGM is enriched for expression of targets of protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a pathway activated by fluid shear stress. By analyzing CREB genomic occupancy from chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, we identified the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway as a potential regulator of CREB. By chemical modulation of the PKA-CREB and BMP pathways in isolated AGM VE-cadherin(+) cells from mid-gestation embryos, we demonstrate that PKA-CREB regulates hematopoietic engraftment and clonogenicity of hematopoietic progenitors, and is dependent on secreted BMP ligands through the type I BMP receptor. Finally, we observed blunting of this signaling axis using Ncx1-null embryos, which lack a heartbeat and intravascular flow. Collectively, we have identified a novel PKA-CREB-BMP signaling pathway downstream of shear stress that regulates HSC emergence in the AGM via the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transitio.
w promotes emergence of definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the developing embryo, yet the signals generated by hemodynamic forces that influence hematopoietic potential remain poorly defined. Here we show that fluid shear stress endows long-term multilineage engraftment potential upon early hematopoietic tissues at embryonic day 9.5, an embryonic stage not previously described to harbor HSCs. Effects on hematopoiesis are mediated in part by a cascade downstream of wall shear stress that involves calcium efflux and stimulation of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling axis. Blockade of the PGE2-cAMP-PKA pathway in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) abolished enhancement in hematopoietic activity. Furthermore, Ncx1 heartbeat mutants, as well as static cultures of AGM, exhibit lower levels of expression of prostaglandin synthases and reduced phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Similar to flow-exposed cultures, transient treatment of AGM with the synthetic analogue 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 stimulates more robust engraftment of adult recipients and greater lymphoid reconstitution. These data provide one mechanism by which biomechanical forces induced by blood flow modulate hematopoietic potentia.
ely known that ion channels are expressed in the plasma membrane. However, a few studies have suggested that several ion channels including voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels also exist in intracellular organelles where they are involved in the biochemical events associated with cell signaling. In the present study, Western blot analysis using fractionated protein clearly indicates that Kv1.3 channels are expressed in the nuclei of MCF7, A549, and SNU-484 cancer cells and human brain tissues. In addition, Kv1.3 is located in the plasma membrane and the nucleus of Jurkat T cells. Nuclear membrane hyperpolarization after treatment with margatoxin (MgTX), a specific blocker of Kv1.3 channels, provides evidence for functional channels at the nuclear membrane of A549 cells. MgTX-induced hyperpolarization is abolished in the nuclei of Kv1.3 silenced cells, and the effects of MgTX are dependent on the magnitude of the K(+) gradient across the nuclear membrane. Selective Kv1.3 blockers induce the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Fos activation. Moreover, Kv1.3 is shown to form a complex with the upstream binding factor 1 in the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveals that Sp1 transcription factor is directly bound to the promoter region of the Kv1.3 gene, and the Sp1 regulates Kv1.3 expression in the nucleus of A549 cells. These results demonstrate that Kv1.3 channels are primarily localized in the nucleus of several types of cancer cells and human brain tissues where they are capable of regulating nuclear membrane potential and activation of transcription factors, such as phosphorylated CREB and c-Fo.
nd calcium channels are closely related to the estrogen-induced nongenomic effect of endometrial carcinoma, but the specific role of calcium channels is unknown. This study aimed to explore the expression and the biologic effect of the L-type calcium channel in endometrial carcinoma cells and to clarify the molecular mechanism of the relationship between L-type calcium channels and estrogen. The immunohistochemical results showed that Ca(2+) channel subunit α 1D (Cav1.3) expression was high in atypical hyperplasia (1.90 ± 0.35) and endometrial carcinoma tissues (2.05 ± 0.82) but weak (0.80 ± 0.15) in benign endometrial tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Treatment with 17β-estradiol rapidly increased Cav1.3 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and 100 nM cell-impermeable β-estradiol-6-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime:bovine serum albumin also promoted Cav1.3 expression. Transfection with small interfering RNA against G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) suppressed estrogen-induced up-regulation of Cav1.3 compared with control cells and markedly reduced the estrogen-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB. Knocking down the Cav1.3 significantly suppressed estrogen-stimulated Ca(2+) influx, cell proliferation, and migration in endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, Cav1.3 was overexpressed in atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma, and the estrogen-induced phosphorylation of downstream molecular ERK1/2 and CREB is the result of activation of the GPER pathway. L-type channel Cav1.3 is required for estrogen-stimulated Ca(2+) influx and contributes broadly to the development of endometrial cancer. The Cav1.3 channel may be a new target for endometrial carcinoma treatmen.
clooctadiene lignans represent a unique group of natural chemical structures, are considered as protectants against neuronal cell death and cognitive impairment in neurological disorders. Among the family of dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan analogs from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill, neuroprotective potential of schisantherin A (StA) has not yet been characterized. In this study, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-incubated SH-SY5Y cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice were used to study the neuroprotection of StA. Pretreatment with StA significantly inhibited MPP(+)-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, StA conferred significant protection against MPTP-induced loss of TH-positive dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease (PD) mice model. Structure activity relationship analysis suggested that methylenedioxy, benzoyloxy and methoxyl groups, in the dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan of StA, were probably functionally important to its neuroprotective activity. In addition, Western blotting analysis demonstrated that StA exhibited neuroprotection against MPP(+) through the regulation of two distinct pathways including increasing CREB-mediated Bcl-2 expression and activating PI3K/Akt survival signaling suggesting that StA might be a promising neuroprotective agent for the prevention of P.
a and surgery can induce postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Ser-133 phosphorylation sites of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is a key gene that mediate a variety of downstream transcription initiation factors, regulate neuronal survival and promote the expression of a large number of genes. Thus, CREB may play a role in this impairment. We hypothesize that and sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment possibly via inhibiting the expression of CREB downstream genes and protein.
his hypothesis, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sevoflurane exposure and were tested with a series of behavioral experiments (open field, passive avoidance test and Morris water maze test) at different time (1 d to 95 d). Besides, blood gas changes and expiratory sevoflurane concentrations were examined at 2 h; the levels of phosphorylated CREB 1, the protein Bcl-2, Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 were assessed at 1 week and 3 months after anesthesia. We also conducted a comparison in sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment between male and female rat.
found that sevoflurane anesthesia can impair short-term cognitive function, which may be via down-regulating p-CREB1 and Bcl-2 expression and up-regulating Caspase-8 expression to reduce hippocampus neuronal apoptosis, and male rats suffered a more severe cognitive dysfunction than female rats. In addition, sevoflurane can produce a reversible long-term cognitive dysfunction in rat.
tic growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling pathways are implicated in the regulation of FGF-23 gene transcription, but the molecular pathways remain poorly defined. We used low molecular weight (LMW, 18 kDa) FGF-2 and high molecular weight (HMW) FGF-2 isoforms, which, respectively, activate cell surface FGF receptors and intranuclear FGFR1, to determine the roles of membrane FGFRs and integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling (INFS) in the regulation of FGF-23 gene transcription in osteoblasts. We found that LMW-FGF-2 induced NFAT and Ets1 binding to conserved cis-elements in the proximal FGF-23 promoter and stimulated FGF-23 promoter activity through PLCγ/calcineurin/NFAT and MAPK pathways in SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. In contrast, HMW-FGF-2 stimulated FGF-23 promoter activity in osteoblasts through a cAMP-dependent binding of FGFR1 and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) to a conserved cAMP response element (CRE) contiguous with the NFAT binding site in the FGF-23 promoter. Mutagenesis of the NFAT and CRE binding sites, respectively, inhibited the effects of LMW-FGF-2 and HMW-FGF-23 to stimulate FGF-23 promoter activity. FGF-2 activation of both membrane FGFRs and INFS-dependent FGFR1 pathways may provide a means to integrate systemic and local regulation of FGF-23 transcription under diverse physiological and pathological condition.
 in circulating glucagon during fasting maintain glucose balance by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. Acute ethanol intoxication promotes fasting hypoglycemia through an increase in hepatic NADH, which inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis by reducing the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. Here we show that acute ethanol exposure also lowers fasting blood glucose concentrations by inhibiting the CREB-mediated activation of the gluconeogenic program in response to glucagon. Ethanol exposure blocked the recruitment of CREB and its coactivator CRTC2 to gluconeogenic promoters by up-regulating ATF3, a transcriptional repressor that also binds to cAMP-responsive elements and thereby down-regulates gluconeogenic genes. Targeted disruption of ATF3 decreased the effects of ethanol in fasted mice and in cultured hepatocytes. These results illustrate how the induction of transcription factors with overlapping specificity can lead to cross-coupling between stress and hormone-sensitive pathway.
recent studies have shown that adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing occurs in microRNAs (miRNAs), its effects on tumour growth and metastasis are not well understood. We present evidence of CREB-mediated low expression of ADAR1 in metastatic melanoma cell lines and tumour specimens. Re-expression of ADAR1 resulted in the suppression of melanoma growth and metastasis in&nbsp;vivo. Consequently, we identified three miRNAs undergoing A-to-I editing in the weakly metastatic melanoma but not in strongly metastatic cell lines. One of these miRNAs, miR-455-5p, has two A-to-I RNA-editing sites. The biological function of edited miR-455-5p is different from that of the unedited form, as it recognizes a different set of genes. Indeed, wild-type miR-455-5p promotes melanoma metastasis through inhibition of the tumour suppressor gene CPEB1. Moreover, wild-type miR-455 enhances melanoma growth and metastasis in&nbsp;vivo, whereas the edited form inhibits these features. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for RNA editing in melanoma progressio.
f allergen to IgE on basophils positively affects allergic inflammation by releasing inflammatory mediators. Recently, basophils were shown to express pattern-recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), for recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are independent of allergen-IgE binding. In this study, we investigated whether MAMP alone can induce IL-6 production in a human basophil cell line, KU812. Stimulation with flagellin in the absence of allergen-IgE association induced IL-6 expression in KU812 cells, while stimulation with lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, or poly I:C did not under the same condition. Flagellin-induced IL-6 expression was also observed in human primary basophils. Flow cytometric analysis showed that KU812 cells expressed flagellin-recognizing TLR5 both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm while TLR2 and TLR3 were observed only in the cytoplasm. We further demonstrated that although flagellin augmented the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases including p38 kinase, ERK, and JNK, flagellin-induced IL-6 production was attenuated by inhibitors for p38 kinase and ERK, but not by JNK inhibitors. In addition, flagellin enhanced phosphorylation of signaling molecules including CREB, PKCδ, and AKT. The inhibitors for PKA and PKC also showed inhibitory effects. Interestingly, flagellin-induced IL-6 production was further enhanced by pretreatment with inhibitors for PI3K, implying that PI3K negatively affects the flagellin-induced IL-6 production. Furthermore, DNA binding activities of NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB, which play pivotal roles in the induction of IL-6 gene expression, were increased by flagellin. These results suggest that flagellin alone is sufficient to induce IL-6 gene expression via TLR5 signaling pathways in human basophil.
pairment is often associated with disrupted regulation of gene induction. For example, deficits in cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP; an essential cofactor for activation of transcription by CREB) impair long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. Previously, we showed that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced knockdown of CBP in individual sensory neurons significantly reduced levels of CBP and impaired 5-HT-induced long-term facilitation (LTF) in sensorimotor cocultures from Aplysia. Moreover, computational simulations of the biochemical cascades underlying LTF successfully predicted training protocols that restored LTF following CBP knockdown. We examined whether simulations could also predict a training protocol that restores LTF impaired by siRNA-induced knockdown of the transcription factor CREB1. Simulations based on a previously described model predicted rescue protocols that were specific to CREB1 knockdown. Empirical studies demonstrated that one of these rescue protocols partially restored impaired LTF. In addition, the effectiveness of the rescue protocol was enhanced by pretreatment with rolipram, a selective cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor. These results provide further evidence that computational methods can help rescue disruptions in signaling cascades underlying memory formation. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the effectiveness of computationally designed training protocols can be enhanced with complementary pharmacological approache.
ell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL), which is an aggressive form of T-cell malignancy. HTLV-1 oncoproteins, Tax and HBZ, play crucial roles in the immortalization of T-cells and/or leukemogenesis by dysregulating the cellular functions in the host. Recent studies show that HTLV-1-infected T-cells have reduced expression of the BCL11B tumor suppressor protein. In the present study, we explored whether Tax and/or HBZ play a role in downregulating BCL11B in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Lentiviral transduction of Tax in a human T-cell line repressed the expression of BCL11B at both the protein and mRNA levels, whereas the transduction of HBZ had little effect on the expression. Tax mutants with a decreased activity for the NF-κB, CREB or PDZ protein pathways still showed a reduced expression of the BCL11B protein, thereby implicating a different function of Tax in BCL11B downregulation. In addition, the HTLV-2 Tax2 protein reduced the BCL11B protein expression in T-cells. Seven HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, including three ATL-derived cell lines, showed reduced BCL11B mRNA and protein expression relative to an uninfected T-cell line, and the greatest reductions were in the cells expressing Tax. Collectively, these results indicate that Tax is responsible for suppressing BCL11B protein expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cells; Tax-mediated repression of BCL11B is another mechanism that Tax uses to promote oncogenesis of HTLV-1-infected T-cell.
response element (CRE)-binding protein, CREB, is a transcription factor whose activity in the brain is critical for long-term memory formation. Phosphorylation of Ser133 in the kinase-inducible domain (KID), that in turn leads to the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), is thought to mediate the activation of CREB. However, the importance of phosphorylation for CREB binding to DNA and subsequent gene transcription in vivo is controversial. To definitively address the role of CREB phosphorylation in gene transcription and learning and memory, we derived mutant mice lacking the Ser133 phosphorylation site. These mice exhibit normal CREB-mediated gene transcription for a number of genes implicated in learning and memory processes. Furthermore these mice have no deficits in hippocampus- or striatum-dependent learning. Strikingly, our findings show that CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 is not necessary for CREB binding to CRE sites, CREB-mediated transcription, or CREB-mediated behavioral phenotypes associated with learning and memor.
's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The loss of SNc dopaminergic neurons affects the plasticity of striatal neurons and leads to significant motor and cognitive disabilities during the progression of the disease. PARK2 encodes for the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin and is implicated in genetic and sporadic PD. Mutations in PARK2 are a major contributing factor in the early onset of autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), although the mechanisms by which a disruption in parkin function contributes to the pathophysiology of PD remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that parkin is an E3 ligase for STEP61 (striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase), a protein tyrosine phosphatase implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. In cellular models, parkin ubiquitinates STEP61 and thereby regulates its level through the proteasome system, whereas clinically relevant parkin mutants fail to do so. STEP61 protein levels are elevated on acute down-regulation of parkin or in PARK2 KO rat striatum. Relevant to PD, STEP61 accumulates in the striatum of human sporadic PD and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned mice. The increase in STEP61 is associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of its substrate ERK1/2 and the downstream target of ERK1/2, pCREB [phospho-CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein)]. These results indicate that STEP61 is a novel substrate of parkin, although further studies are necessary to determine whether elevated STEP61 levels directly contribute to the pathophysiology of P.
esses in endothelial cells including angiogenic responses are regulated by microRNAs. However, there is limited information available about their complex cross-talk in regulating certain endothelial function.
tive of this study is to identify endothelial functions of the pro-hypertrophic miR-212/132 cluster and its cross-talk with other microRNAs during development and diseas.
how that anti-angiogenic stimulation by transforming growth factor-beta activates the microRNA-212/132 cluster by derepression of their transcriptional co-activator cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) which is a novel target of a previously identified pro-angiogenic miRNA miR-30a-3p in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, despite having the same seed-sequence, miR-212 and miR-132 exerted differential effects on endothelial transcriptome regulation and cellular functions with stronger endothelial inhibitory effects caused by miR-212. These differences could be attributed to additional auxiliary binding of miR-212 to its targets. In vivo, deletion of the miR-212/132 cluster increased endothelial vasodilatory function, improved angiogenic responses during postnatal development and in adult mic.
ts identify (i) a novel miRNA-cross-talk involving miR-30a-3p and miR-212, which led to suppression of important endothelial genes such as GAB1 and SIRT1 finally culminating in impaired endothelial function; and (ii) microRNAs may have different biological roles despite having the same seed sequenc.
ular pathways underlying age-related memory changes remain unclear. There is a substantial genetic contribution to memory performance through life span. A recent study has implicated RbAp48, which mediates its effect on age-related memory decline by interacting with cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB)1 binding protein and influencing this histone acetylation pathway. To validate these findings, we tested whether genetic variants in RbAp48, CREB1, and CREBBP are associated with memory performance in 3 independent data sets consisting of 2674 cognitively healthy elderly individuals. Genetic variant rs2526690 in the CREBBP gene was significantly associated with episodic memory performance (pmeta&nbsp;= 3.7&nbsp;× 10(-4)) in a multivariate model adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E status. Identifying genetic variants that modulate mechanisms of cognitive aging will allow identifying valid targets for therapeutic interventio.
c ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer due in part to a lack of highly robust cytotoxic or molecular-based therapies. Recent studies investigating ligand-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling have highlighted its importance in pancreatic cancer initiation and progression, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC. The small-molecule ICG-001 binds cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) to disrupt its interaction with β-catenin and inhibit CBP function as a coactivator of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. Given its ability to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription in vitro and in vivo, as well as its efficacy in preclinical models of colorectal cancer and other Wnt-driven diseases, we examined ICG-001 and its potential role as a therapeutic in PDAC. ICG-001 alone significantly inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of multiple PDAC lines, and augmented in vitro growth inhibition when used in combination with gemcitabine. ICG-001 had only variable modest effects on PDAC apoptosis and instead mediated PDAC growth inhibition primarily through robust induction of G₁ cell-cycle arrest. These effects, however, seemed decoupled from its inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. DNA microarrays performed on PDAC cells in the context of ICG-001 treatment revealed ICG-001 altered the expression of several genes with well-established roles in DNA replication and cell-cycle progression, including direct actions on SKP2 and CDKN1A. ICG-001 also significantly prolonged survival in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft model of PDAC, indicating ICG-001 or derived compounds that disrupt CBP activity are potentially useful small-molecule therapeutics for pancreatic cance.
 activity of the renin-angiotensin system within the brain elevates fluid intake, blood pressure, and resting metabolic rate. Renin and angiotensinogen are coexpressed within the same cells of the subfornical organ, and the production and action of ANG II through the ANG II type 1 receptor in the subfornical organ (SFO) are necessary for fluid intake due to increased activity of the brain renin-angiotensin system. We generated an inducible model of ANG II production by breeding transgenic mice expressing human renin in neurons controlled by the synapsin promoter with transgenic mice containing a Cre-recombinase-inducible human angiotensinogen construct. Adenoviral delivery of Cre-recombinase causes SFO-selective induction of human angiotensinogen expression. Selective production of ANG II in the SFO results in increased water intake but did not change blood pressure or resting metabolic rate. The increase in water intake was ANG II type 1 receptor-dependent. When given a choice between water and 0.15 M NaCl, these mice increased total fluid and sodium, but not water, because of an increased preference for NaCl. When provided a choice between water and 0.3 M NaCl, the mice exhibited increased fluid, water, and sodium intake, but no change in preference for NaCl. The increase in fluid intake was blocked by an inhibitor of PKC, but not ERK, and was correlated with increased phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein in the subfornical organ. Thus, increased production and action of ANG II specifically in the subfornical organ are sufficient on their own to mediate an increase in drinking through PK.
side A (TFSA) is a bioactive oligosaccharide ester component of Polygala tenuifolia Wild, a traditional Chinese medicine which was used to manage mental disorders effectively. The neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic effects of TFSA have been demonstrated in our previous studies. The present work was designed to study the molecular mechanism of TFSA on promoting the viability of rat glioma cells C6. We exposed C6 cells to TFSA (or combined with ERK, PI3K and TrkB inhibitors) to examine the effects of TFSA on the cell viability and the expression and phosphorylation of key proteins in the ERK and PI3K signaling pathway. TFSA increased levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-Akt, enhanced release of BDNF, which were blocked by ERK and PI3K inhibitors, respectively (U0126 and LY294002). Moreover, the TFSA caused the enhanced phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) at Ser133 site, the effect was revoked by U0126, LY294002 and K252a. Furthermore, when C6 cells were pretreated with K252a, a TrkB antagonist, known to significantly inhibit the activity of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), blocked the levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-Akt and phosphor-CREB. Taking these results together, we suggested the neuroprotection of TFSA might be mediated through BDNF/TrkB-ERK/PI3K-CREB signaling pathway in C6 glioma cell.
n of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptors plays a role in adult neurogenesis and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPC). Herein, we examined the involvement of 5-HT receptors in the differentiation of mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells into NPC. To induce embryoid body (EB) formation, mouse iPS cells were cultured on ultralow-attachment dishes. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; 1&nbsp;μmol/L) and/or 5-HT (0.03 or 0.1&nbsp;μmol/L) was added to the EB cultures for 4&nbsp;days and then EB plated on gelatin-coated plates were cultured for 7 or 14&nbsp;days. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that mouse iPS cells expressed both 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptors and, to a lesser extent, 5-HT1A receptors. Treatment with 5-HT significantly enhanced the ATRA-induced expression of nestin, a specific marker for NPC, and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Pretreatment of EB cultures with either 1&nbsp;μmol/L GR113808 (a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist) or 1&nbsp;μmol/L H89 (a protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor) significantly inhibited these effects of 5-HT. These findings suggest that stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors may enhance ATRA-induced neural differentiation of mouse iPS cells through activation of PKA and CRE.
 hypoxia is a result of abnormal and shallow trophoblast invasion and involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Hypoxia increases extracellular adenosine levels and plays an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis, proliferation, vascular tone, endothelial permeability and inflammation. It was shown that adenosine concentrations are higher in preeclamptic patients. We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia and A2B adenosine receptor activation influence cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, proliferation, invasion and cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling in trophoblast cells (HTR-8/SVneo.
eo and human uterine microvascular endothelial cells (HUtMVEC) were used as model for experiments. We employed a cAMP assay, invasion assay, proliferation, RT-PCR and Western Blot. Statistical analyses were performed with ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis-, Wilcoxon signed rank- or Mann-Whitney Test, as appropriat.
2% O2) in comparison to normoxia (21% O2) led to increased A2B mRNA levels (1.21 ± 0.06 fold, 1 h 2% O2; 1.66 ± 0.2 fold, 4 h 2% O2 and 1.2 ± 0.04 fold, 24 h 2% O2). A2B adenosine receptor activation (NECA) stimulated trophoblast proliferation at 2% O2 (1.27 ± 0.06 fold) and 8% O2 (1.17 ± 0.07 fold) after 24 h and at 2% O2 (1.22 ± 0.05 fold), 8% O2 (1.23 ± 0.09 fold) and 21% O2 (1.15 ± 0.04 fold) after 48 h of incubation. Trophoblast invasion into an endothelial monolayer was significantly expanded by activation of the receptor (NECA) at 8% O2 (1.20 ± 0.07 fold) and 21% O2 (1.22 ± 0.006 fold). A2B adenosine receptor stimulation (NECA) additionally led to increased CREB phosphorylation in trophoblast cells at 2% O2 (2.13 ± 0.45 fold), 8% O2 (1.55 ± 0.13 fold) and 21% O2 (1.71 ± 0.34 fold). Blocking of CREB signaling resulted in reduced proliferation and CREB phosphorylatio.
a expand the recent knowledge regarding the role of adenosine receptor A2B in human placental development, and may provide insight in mechanisms associated with pregnancy complications linked to impaired trophoblast invasion such as preeclampsi.
 opioid exposure has a negative effect on neurogenesis and produces neurological consequences. However, its mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. Buprenorphine, a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist, is an alternative medication for managing pregnant opioid addicts. This study provides evidence of decreased neurogenesis and depression-like consequences following prenatal exposure to buprenorphine and sheds light on mechanisms of action in a rat model involving administration of intraperitoneal injection to pregnant rats starting from gestation day 7 and lasting for 14 days and a cultured neurosphere model. Results of forced swimming test and tail suspension test showed that pups at postnatal day 21 had worse parameters of depression-like neurobehaviors, independent of gender. Neurobehavioral changes were accompanied by reduction of neuronal composition, biochemical parameters of neural stem/progenitor cells, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B phosphorylation, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation. Results of parallel cell studies further demonstrated a negative impact of buprenorphine on cultured neurospheres, including proliferation, differentiation, BDNF expression and signaling, and PKA activity. Taken together, our results suggest that prenatal exposure to buprenorphine might result in depression-like phenotypes associated with impaired BDNF action and decreased neurogenesis in the developing brain of weanling.
ntermittent hypoxia (CIH) is an underlying component of obstructive sleep apnoea and has been shown to have deleterious and damaging effects on central neurons and to impair synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. CIH has previously been shown to impair synaptic plasticity and working memory. CIH is a potent inducer of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a key regulator in a cell's adaptation to hypoxia that plays an important role in the fate of neurons during ischemia. Levels of HIF-1α are regulated by the activity of a group of enzymes called HIF-prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs) and these have become potential pharmacological targets for preconditioning against ischemia. However little is known about the effects of prolyl hydroxylase inhibition and CIH on synaptic transmission and plasticity in sub-regions of the hippocampus. Male Wistar rats were treated for 7-days with either saline, CIH or PHD inhibition (dimethyloxaloylglycine, DMOG; 50mg/kg, i.p.). At the end of treatment all three groups showed no change in synaptic excitability using paired pulse paradigms. However long-term potentiation (LTP) was impaired in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in both CIH and DMOG treated animals. LTP induced in the dentate gyrus was not significantly affected by either CIH or DMOG treatment. We also investigated the effect of 7-day CIH and DMOG treatment on the recovery of synaptic transmission following an acute 30min hypoxic insult. CIH treated animals showed an improved rate of recovery of synaptic transmission following re-oxygenation in both the CA1 and the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that LTP induction in the CA1 region is more sensitive to both CIH and DMOG treatments than the dentate gyru.
phenotype analysis of at least 25 individuals with interstitial 16p13.3 duplications defines a recognizable syndrome associated with duplication of a critical Rubinstein-Taybi region encompassing only the CREBBP gene. Nevertheless, variable or incompletely penetrant phenotype has been reported previously. We here report a case of a 5-year old boy with a recognizable phenotype of this syndrome, including intellectual disability, mild arthrogryposis, small and proximally implanted thumbs and characteristic facial features. In addition, growth delay, microcephaly and distinguishable structural brain MRI abnormalities were observed. A de novo 1.5 Mb interstitial duplication of 16p13.3 was detected by SNP-array and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) analysis with marker D16S475 indicated that the duplication was formed before maternal meiosis II. Our findings highlight the variable clinical features and further expand the phenotypic spectrum correlated with this lately proposed syndrom.
midine, an α-2a adrenergic agonist, given pre- and postoperatively was previously shown to attenuate neuronal injury in a murine model of spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion. In the brain, α-2 agonists have been shown to induce the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response-element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor necessary for neuron survival. We hypothesized that the α-2a adrenergic agonist given preoperatively increases CREB-mediated neuroprotective proteins, attenuating neuronal injury and cytoarchitectural deca.
 C57BL/6 mice) underwent 5 minutes of aortic occlusion via median sternotomy. Mice&nbsp;received 25 μg/kg dexmedetomidine or equivalent normal saline at 24 hours, 12 hours, and 30 minutes preoperatively. Functional outcomes were recorded at 6 to 48 hours postoperatively when spinal cords were removed for histologic analysis. Spinal cords were examined for protein kinase B, CREB, B-cell lymphoma 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor following treatment alone or ischemia-reperfusion surger.
 aortic occlusion, mice in the treatment group had preserved neurologic function at all time points (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05). Histologic analysis showed preserved cytoarchitecture and decreased neuronal injury in the treatment group when compared with ischemic controls. Additionally, analysis of spinal cord homogenate following surgery and pretreatment revealed a significant (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;.05) increase in B-cell lymphoma 2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and protein kinase B and CREB phosphorylation with α-2a adrenergic agonist pretreatmen.
ent with the α-2a agonist dexmedetomidine preserved neurologic function and attenuated neuronal injury following thoracic aortic occlusion in mice. This relationship was associated with an increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B and CREB and subsequent up-regulation of antiapoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, α-2a receptor agonism-induced CREB phosphorylation and contributes to dexmedetomidine's protective mechanism in the spinal cord following ischemi.
igated whether δ-opioid receptor (DOR)-induced neuroprotection involves the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. We studied the effect of DOR activation on the expression of BDNF and other proteins in the cortex of C57BL/6 mice exposed to hypoxia (10% of oxygen) for 1-10 days. The results showed that: (1) 1-day hypoxia had no appreciable effect on BDNF expression, while 3- and 10-day hypoxia progressively decreased BDNF expression, resulting in 37.3% reduction (p &lt; 0.05) after 10-day exposure; (2) DOR activation with UFP-512 (1 mg/kg, i.p., daily) partially reversed the hypoxia-induced reduction of BDNF expression in the 3- or 10-day exposed cortex; (3) DOR activation partially reversed the hypoxia-induced reduction in functional TrkB (140-kDa) and attenuated hypoxia-induced increase in truncated TrkB (90-kDa) in the 3- or 10-day hypoxic cortex; and (4) prolonged hypoxia (10 days) significantly increased TNF-α level and decreased CD11b expression in the cortex, which was completely reversed following DOR activation; and (5) there was no significant change in pCREB and pATF-1 levels in the hypoxic cortex. We conclude that prolonged hypoxia down-regulates BDNF-TrkB signaling leading to an increase in TNF-α in the cortex, while DOR activation up-regulates BDNF-TrkB signaling thereby decreasing TNF-α levels in the hypoxic corte.
icits relapse to cocaine seeking in humans and in animal models. Cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is required for swim stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine conditioned place preference. However, the role of CREB in other stress-induced reinstatement models has not been examined. To determine whether CREB is required across different stressors we examined the ability of restraint to elicit reinstatement of cocaine-conditioned place preference in wild-type and CREBαΔ mutant mice. In contrast to previously published differences in swim stress-induced reinstatement, both wild-type and CREBαΔ mutant mice demonstrated restraint stress elicited reinstatement of cocaine-conditioned reward. While CREB is necessary for swim stress-elicited zif268 expression within the nucleus accubmens (NAc) shell and prelimbic cortex (PrL), restraint-stress-elicited comparable increases in zif268 expression within these regions in both wild-type and CREBαΔ mutant mice. Our findings suggest that not all stressors engage the same circuits or molecular mechanisms to elicit reinstatement behavio.
deling, a physiological process characterized by bone formation by osteoblasts (OBs) and resorption of preexisting bone matrix by osteoclasts (OCs), is vital for the maintenance of healthy bone tissue in adult humans. Imbalances in this vital process result in pathological conditions including osteoporosis. Owing to its initial asymptomatic nature, osteoporosis is often detected only after the patient has sustained significant bone loss or a fracture. Hence, anabolic therapeutics that stimulate bone accrual is in high clinical demand. Here we identify Ca²⁺/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) as a potential target for such therapeutics because its inhibition enhances OB differentiation and bone growth and suppresses OC differentiation. Mice null for CaMKK2 possess higher trabecular bone mass in their long bones, along with significantly more OBs and fewer multinuclear OCs. In vitro, although Camkk2⁻/⁻ mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) yield significantly higher numbers of OBs, bone marrow cells from Camkk2⁻/⁻ mice produce fewer multinuclear OCs. Acute inhibition of CaMKK2 by its selective, cell-permeable pharmacological inhibitor STO-609 also results in increased OB and diminished OC formation. Further, we find phospho-protein kinase A (PKA) and Ser¹³³ phosphorylated form of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB) to be markedly elevated in OB progenitors deficient in CaMKK2. On the other hand, genetic ablation of CaMKK2 or its pharmacological inhibition in OC progenitors results in reduced pCREB as well as significantly reduced levels of its transcriptional target, nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic (NFATc1). Moreover, in vivo administration of STO-609 results in increased OBs and diminished OCs, conferring significant protection from ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis in adult mice. Overall, our findings reveal a novel function for CaMKK2 in bone remodeling and highlight the potential for its therapeutic inhibition as a valuable bone anabolic strategy that also inhibits OC differentiation in the treatment of osteoporosi.
hown in vitro a hypoxia-induced time-dependent increase in facilitative glucose transporter isoform 3 (GLUT3) expression in N2A murine neuroblasts. This increase in GLUT3 expression is partially reliant on a transcriptional increase noted in actinomycin D and cycloheximide pretreatment experiments. Transient transfection assays in N2A neuroblasts using murine glut3-luciferase reporter constructs mapped the hypoxia-induced enhancer activities to -857- to -573-bp and -203- to -177-bp regions. Hypoxia-exposed N2A nuclear extracts demonstrated an increase in HIF-1α and p-Creb binding to HRE (-828 to -824 bp) and AP-1 (-187 to -180 bp) cis-elements, respectively, in electromobility shift and supershift assays, which was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, the interaction of CBP with Creb and HIF-1α and CREST with CBP in hypoxia was detected by coimmunoprecipitation. Furthermore, small interference (si)RNA targeting Creb in these cells decreased endogenous Creb concentrations that reduced by twofold hypoxia-induced glut3 gene transcription. Thus, in N2A neuroblasts, phosphorylated HIF-1α and Creb mediated the hypoxia-induced increase in glut3 transcription. Coactivation by the Ca⁺⁺-dependent CREST and CBP proteins may enhance cross-talk between p-Creb-AP-1 and HIF-1α/HRE of the glut3 gene. Collectively, these processes can facilitate an adaptive response to hypoxic energy depletion targeted at enhancing glucose transport and minimizing injury while fueling the proliferative potential of neuroblast.
 coupled designer receptors that are specifically activated by designer drugs have been developed. Here, we have analyzed the regulation of gene transcription following activation of Gα(q)-coupled designer receptor (Rα(q)). Stimulation of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing Rα(q) with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), a pharmacologically inert compound, induced the expression of biologically active Egr-1, a zinc finger transcription factor. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the ternary complex factor (TCF) Elk-1, a key transcriptional regulator of serum response element (SRE)-driven gene transcription, prevented Egr-1 expression. Stimulation of Rα(q) with CNO increased the transcriptional activation potential of Elk-1 and enhanced transcription of an SRE regulated reporter gene. In addition, AP-1 transcriptional activity was significantly elevated. AP-1 activity was controlled by TCFs and c-Jun in cells expressing an activated Gα(q)-coupled designer receptor. CNO stimulation did not increase Egr-1 and AP-1 activity in neuroblastoma cells expressing endogenous M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, indicating that CNO did not function as a ligand for these receptors. Rα(q) stimulation also increased the transcriptional activation potential of CREB and cAMP response controlled gene transcription. Pharmacological and genetic experiments revealed that the protein kinases Raf and ERK were essential to connect Rα(q) stimulation with enhanced Egr-1 and AP-1 controlled transcription. In contrast, MAP kinase phosphatase-1 functioned as a nuclear shut-off device of stimulus-transcription coupling. The fact that Rα(q) stimulation activates the transcription factors Egr-1, Elk-1, AP-1, and CREB indicates that regulation of gene transcription is an integral part of Gα(q)-coupled receptor signalin.
alts are important drugs to treat bipolar disorder. Previous work showed that lithium by enforcing the interaction between the transcription factor CREB and its coactivator CRTC1 enhanced cAMP-stimulated CREB-dependent gene transcription. Both CREB and CRTC have been implicated in neuronal adaptation, which might underlie lithium's therapeutic action. In the present study the mechanisms of lithium action on cAMP-induced CREB-dependent gene transcription were further elucidated. Transient transfection assays revealed that all three CRTC isoforms conferred lithium responsiveness to CREB whereas their intrinsic transcriptional activities remained unchanged by lithium, suggesting a conformational change of CREB or CRTC by lithium. In in vitro protein-protein interaction assays lithium enhanced the interaction between CREB and both coactivators CRTC and CBP. Furthermore, lithium enforced the oligomerization of CRTC, a prerequisite for CREB interaction. For further evaluation it was investigated whether lithium competes with magnesium, which coordinates the conformation of the CREB basic region leucine zipper (bZip). Mutational analysis of the magnesium coordinating lysine-290 within the bZip, in vitro and intracellular interaction assays and luciferase reporter-gene assays revealed that the effect of lithium on the CREB-CRTC interaction or on the transcriptional activity, respectively, was not affected by the mutation, thus excluding a magnesium-lithium competition. However, the CREB-CRTC interaction was strongly increased in lysine-290-mutants thereby extending the CRTC-CREB interaction domain. Taken together the results exclude a competition between lithium and magnesium at the bZip, but suggest that lithium by enforcing the CRTC-oligomer formation and the interaction of CREB-CBP-CRTC enhances cAMP-induced CREB-dependent gene transcriptio.
ng insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been shown to act as a negative feedback regulator of growth hormone (GH) gene expression; however, the mechanism of this negative feedback is poorly understood. Activation and regulation of GH gene expression require the binding of the transcription factor POU1F1 to the GH promoter along with cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP). We investigate the role of CBP as a target of IGF-1 somatotroph regulation using the MtT/S somatotroph cell line. IGF-1 significantly inhibits basal GH mRNA levels but not POU1F1 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate inhibition of CBP binding to the GH promoter after IGF-1 treatment. We hypothesized that IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling disrupts the POU1F1/CBP complex to inhibit gene expression. In support, the use of a mutant CBP (S436A) construct, which lacks a critical phosphorylation site, leads to the loss of IGF-1 inhibition. The studies of CBP (S436A) knock-in mice show elevated serum GH levels, a greater response to GH releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulation along with lower weight gain, and decreased body fat. Our data confirm the inhibitory effects of IGF-1 on GH expression at the level of the promoter and provide evidence of CBP's role as a target of IGF-1R signalin.
nducible factors (HIFs) are oxygen-sensitive transcription factors. HIF-1α plays a prominent role in hypoxic gene induction. HIF-2α target genes are more restricted but include erythropoietin (Epo), one of the most highly hypoxia-inducible genes in mammals. We previously reported that HIF-2α is acetylated during hypoxia but is rapidly deacetylated by the stress-responsive deacetylase Sirtuin 1. We now demonstrate that the lysine acetyltransferases cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are required for efficient Epo induction during hypoxia. However, despite close structural similarity, the roles of CBP and p300 differ in HIF signaling. CBP acetylates HIF-2α, is a major coactivator for HIF-2-mediated Epo induction, and is required for Sirt1 augmentation of HIF-2 signaling during hypoxia in Hep3B cells. In comparison, p300 is a major contributor for HIF-1 signaling as indicated by induction of Pgk1. Whereas CBP can bind with HIF-2α independent of the HIF-2α C-terminal activation domain via enzyme/substrate interactions, p300 only complexes with HIF-2α through the C-terminal activation domain. Maximal CBP/HIF-2 signaling requires intact CBP acetyltransferase activity in both Hep3B cells as well as in mic.
 the effects of exercise on liver and brain bioenergetic infrastructures, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to 6&nbsp;weeks of moderate-intensity treadmill exercise. During the training period, fasting blood glucose was lower in exercised mice than in sedentary mice, but serum insulin levels were not reduced. At week&nbsp;6, trained mice showed a paradoxical decrease in plasma lactate during exercise, which was accompanied by an increase in the liver monocarboxylate transporter&nbsp;2 protein level (∼30%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Exercise increased liver peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator&nbsp;1α expression (approximately twofold, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 protein (∼30%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), p38 protein (∼15%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), cytochrome&nbsp;c oxidase subunit&nbsp;4 isoform&nbsp;1 protein (∼50%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (∼40%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Despite this, liver mitochondrial DNA copy number (∼30%, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.05), mitochondrial transcription factor&nbsp;A expression (∼15%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), cytochrome&nbsp;c oxidase subunit&nbsp;2 expression (∼10%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05), cAMP-response element binding protein phosphorylation (∼60%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression (∼40%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) were all reduced, while cytochrome oxidase and citrate synthase activities were unchanged. The only altered brain parameter observed was a reduction in tumour necrosis factor&nbsp;α expression (∼35%, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05); tumour necrosis factor&nbsp;α expression was unchanged in liver. Our data suggest that lactate produced by exercising muscle modifies the liver bioenergetic infrastructure, and enhanced liver uptake may in turn limit the ability of exercise-generated lactate to modify brain bioenergetics. Also, it appears that, at least in the liver, a dissociated mitochondrial biogenesis, in which some components are strategically enhanced while others are minimized, can occu.
xchange molecular dynamics simulations are performed on the protein complex pKID-KIX to understand the effects of macromolecular crowding on coupled folding and binding events. A structure-based protein model at the residue level is adopted for the two proteins to include intramolecular conformational flexibility, while crowding macromolecules are represented as spherical particles. The interactions between crowders and protein residues can be either purely repulsive or a combination of short-range repulsion and intermediate-range attraction. Consistent with previous studies on rigid-body protein binding in the presence of spherical crowders, we find that the complex formation is stabilized by repulsive protein-crowder interactions and destabilized by sufficiently strong attractive protein-crowder interactions. Competition between stabilizing repulsive and destabilizing attractive interactions is quantitatively captured by a previous theoretical model developed for describing the change in the binding free energy of rigid proteins in a crowded environment. We find that protein flexibility has little effect on the thermodynamics of the pKID-KIX binding (with respect to bulk) for repulsive and weakly attractive protein-crowder interactions. For strong protein-crowder attractive interactions, the destabilizing effect due to crowding is attenuated by protein flexibility. Interestingly, the mechanism of coupled folding and binding observed in bulk remains unchanged under highly crowded conditions over a broad range of protein-crowder interaction strengths. Also, strong protein-crowder attractive interactions can significantly stabilize intermediate states involving partial contact between pKID and KIX domain.
studies indicate that prostaglandins of E class (PGEs) may promote healing of tissue injury e.g., gastroduodenal and dermal ulcers. However, the precise roles of PGEs, their E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, signaling pathways including cAMP and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and their relation to VEGF and angiogenesis in the tissue injury healing process remain unknown, forming the rationale for this study. Using an esophageal ulcer model in rats, we demonstrated that esophageal mucosa expresses predominantly EP2 receptors and that esophageal ulceration triggers an increase in expression of the EP2 receptor, activation of CREB (the downstream target of the cAMP signaling), and enhanced VEGF gene expression. Treatment of rats with misoprostol, a PGE1 analog capable of activating EP receptors, enhanced phosphorylation of CREB, stimulated VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and accelerated esophageal ulcer healing. In cultured human esophageal epithelial (HET-1A) cells, misoprostol increased intracellular cAMP levels (by 163-fold), induced phosphorylation of CREB, and stimulated VEGF expression. A cAMP analog (Sp-cAMP) mimicked, whereas an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (Rp-cAMP) blocked, these effects of misoprostol. These results indicate that the EP2/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway mediates the stimulatory effect of PGEs on angiogenesis essential for tissue injury healing via the induction of CREB activity and VEGF expressio.
l mechanisms underlying the attainment of fear memory accuracy for appropriate discriminative responses to aversive and nonaversive stimuli are unclear. Considerable evidence indicates that coactivator of transcription and histone acetyltransferase cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is critically required for normal neural function. CBP hypofunction leads to severe psychopathological symptoms in human and cognitive abnormalities in genetic mutant mice with severity dependent on the neural locus and developmental time of the gene inactivation. Here, we showed that an acute hypofunction of CBP in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) results in a disruption of fear memory accuracy in mice. In addition, interruption of CREB function in the mPFC also leads to a deficit in auditory discrimination of fearful stimuli. While mice with deficient CBP/CREB signaling in the mPFC maintain normal responses to aversive stimuli, they exhibit abnormal responses to similar but nonrelevant stimuli when compared to control animals. These data indicate that improvement of fear memory accuracy involves mPFC-dependent suppression of fear responses to nonrelevant stimuli. Evidence from a context discriminatory task and a newly developed task that depends on the ability to distinguish discrete auditory cues indicated that CBP-dependent neural signaling within the mPFC circuitry is an important component of the mechanism for disambiguating the meaning of fear signals with two opposing values: aversive and nonaversiv.
functions and responses to stimuli are controlled by complex regulatory networks that comprise a large diversity of molecular components and their interactions. However, achieving an intuitive understanding of the dynamical properties and responses to stimuli of these networks is hampered by their large scale and complexity. To address this issue, analyses of regulatory networks often focus on reduced models that depict distinct, reoccurring connectivity patterns referred to as motifs. Previous modeling studies have begun to characterize the dynamics of small motifs, and to describe ways in which variations in parameters affect their responses to stimuli. The present study investigates how variations in pairs of parameters affect responses in a series of ten common network motifs, identifying concurrent variations that act synergistically (or antagonistically) to alter the responses of the motifs to stimuli. Synergism (or antagonism) was quantified using degrees of nonlinear blending and additive synergism. Simulations identified concurrent variations that maximized synergism, and examined the ways in which it was affected by stimulus protocols and the architecture of a motif. Only a subset of architectures exhibited synergism following paired changes in parameters. The approach was then applied to a model describing interlocked feedback loops governing the synthesis of the CREB1 and CREB2 transcription factors. The effects of motifs on synergism for this biologically realistic model were consistent with those for the abstract models of single motifs. These results have implications for the rational design of combination drug therapies with the potential for synergistic interaction.
ement system can be activated spontaneously for immune surveillance or induced to clear invading pathogens, in which the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) plays a critical role. CD59 is the sole membrane complement regulatory protein (mCRP) that restricts MAC assembly. CD59, therefore, protects innocent host cells from attacks by the complement system, and host cells require the constitutive and inducible expression of CD59 to protect themselves from deleterious destruction by complement. However, the mechanisms that underlie CD59 regulation remain largely unknown. In this study we demonstrate that the widely expressed transcription factor Sp1 may regulate the constitutive expression of CD59, whereas CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 bridge NF-κB and CREB, which surprisingly functions as an enhancer-binding protein to induce the up-regulation of CD59 during in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered complement activation, thus conferring host defense against further MAC-mediated destruction. Moreover, individual treatment with LPS, TNF-α, and the complement activation products (sublytic MAC (SC5b-9) and C5a) could increase the expression of CD59 mainly by activating NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways. Together, our findings identify a novel gene regulation mechanism involving CBP/p300, NF-κB, and CREB; this mechanism suggests potential drug targets for controlling various complement-related human disease.
lmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is expressed in insulin-secreting β cells. However, the effects of CaMKII on insulin synthesis are unknown. Although Ser133 phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) typically increases CREB transcriptional activity, CaMKII phosphorylates CREB at Ser142 and at Ser133 to exert a dominant inhibitory effect. Our objective was to characterize the role of CaMKII in insulin gene expression. In MIN6 cells, insulin gene promoter activity was significantly down-regulated by wild-type (WT) CaMKIIδ2, but was significantly upregulated after small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of CaMKIIδ expression. These results were independent of glucose concentrations and membrane depolarization. Insulin mRNA levels were also decreased by WT CaMKIIδ2 and increased by CaMKIIδ siRNA. Downregulation of insulin gene promoter activity by WT CaMKIIδ2 was partly mediated via cyclic AMP-responsive element 2 (CRE2). WT CaMKIIδ2 significantly increased CREB phosphorylation at Ser142 and significantly decreased binding to CREB binding protein (CBP), whereas kinase dead CaMKIIδ2 did not. Our results indicate that CaMKIIδ2 downregulates insulin gene expression by Ser142 phosphorylation of CREB and reducing binding of CREB to CB.
ence suggests an association between genetic variants within the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB binding protein (CREBBP) and cAMP response element-modulator (CREM) and several psychiatric disorders. The present study investigated whether some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes could be associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) and whether they could predict clinical outcomes in Korean in-patients treated with antidepressants and mood stabilizers, respectively. The sample comprised 145 patients with MDD, 132 patients with BD and 170 psychiatrically healthy controls. Participants were genotyped for 14 SNPs within CREB1, CREBBP and CREM. Baseline and final clinical measures, including the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale for patients with MDD and BD, respectively, were recorded. All p-values were 2-tailed, and statistical significance was conservatively set at the 0.006 level in order to reduce the likelihood of false positive results. We failed to observe any association of the 14 SNPs genotypes or alleles with clinical improvement, response and remission rates as well as final outcomes in any of such disorders. Our findings suggest that the 14 SNP under investigation in our study do not influence diagnosis and treatment response in patients with MDD and BD. However, taking into account the several limitations of our study, further research is needed to draw more definitive conclusion.
ted an autopsy case with severe neonatal respiratory distress, hypoplasia of thymus, thyroid gland and cerebellum, and agenesis of the corpus callosum displaying striking phenotypic similarity to the CrebA knockout mouse. On the assumption that comparable genetic alterations must be present, we checked the whole genomic DNA sequence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein 1 (CREB1), the human counterpart of mouse CrebA, and found a missense c.347A&gt;G mutation corresponding to p.D116G within the kinase-inducible domain (KID) of CREB1. When transcribed in vitro, while Ser-133 phosphorylation of KID was maintained upon forskolin treatment, mutated CREB1 protein failed to associate with the KIX domain of co-activator CREBBP/EP300, and thereby, interrupted cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signal transduction as the dominant-negative form. This is the first report of a sporadic CREB1-related multiple malformation syndrome that, in light of accumulated knowledge of phenotypic features in gene-targeted animals, clearly emphasizes the importance of cross-species translational researc.
nt study explores whether some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CREB1 (rs2709377 and rs6740584), CREBBP (rs2239317, rs2239316, rs3025702, rs130021, rs130005, rs129974 and rs9392) and CREM (rs1148247, rs4934735, rs12775799, rs6481941 and rs16935888) could be associated with schizophrenia (SKZ) and whether they could predict clinical outcomes in Korean in-patients treated with antipsychotics. Two-hundred twenty one in-patients suffering from SKZ and 170 psychiatrically healthy controls were genotyped for 10 SNPs within CREB1, CREBBP and CREM. All patients were assessed for the severity of illness at baseline and at discharge by means of the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS). Our findings suggest the lack of influence of SNPs under investigation in the present study on the susceptibility to SKZ and on the response to antipsychotics. However, taking into account the several limitations of our study, further research is needed to draw more definitive conclusion.
 in the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) are a major cause of the human skeletal dysplasia Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS); however, the mechanism by which these mutations affect skeletal mineralization and patterning is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) as a key regulator of CBP activity and demonstrate that its functions map to both osteoprogenitor cells and mature osteoblasts. In osteoblasts, PDK1 activated the CREB/CBP complex, which in turn controlled runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) activation and expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). These pathways also operated in vivo, as evidenced by recapitulation of RTS spectrum phenotypes with osteoblast-specific Pdk1 deletion in mice (Pdk1osx mice) and by the genetic interactions observed in mice heterozygous for both osteoblast-specific Pdk1 deletion and either Runx2 or Creb deletion. Finally, treatment of Pdk1osx and Cbp+/- embryos with BMPs in utero partially reversed their skeletal anomalies at birth. These findings illustrate the in vivo function of the PDK1-AKT-CREB/CBP pathway in bone formation and provide proof of principle for in utero growth factor supplementation as a potential therapy for skeletal dysplasia.
and in vivo studies implicate that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) play crucial physiological roles in regulating ovarian granulosa cell function essential to fertility control in females. FSH induces cAMP and calcium signaling, thereby activating transcription factor CREB to upregulate steroidogenic gene expression, and TGFβ1 greatly enhances FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis. A CREB coactivator CRTC2/TORC2 was identified to function as a cAMP and calcium-sensitive coincidence sensor. This led us to explore the role of CRTC2 and its regulator calcineurin in FSH and TGFβ1-stimulated steroidogenesis. Primary culture of granulosa cells from gonadotropin-primed immature rats was used. Immunoblotting analysis shows that FSH rapidly and transiently induced dephosphorylation/activation of CRTC2, and FSH + TGFβ1 additionally induced late-phase CRTC2 dephosphorylation. Immunofluorescence analysis further confirms FSH ± TGFβ1 promoted CRTC2 nuclear translocation. Using selective inhibitors, we demonstrate that FSH activated CRTC2 in a PKA- and calcineurin-dependent manner, and TGFβ1 acting through its type I receptor (TGFβRI)-modulated FSH action in a calcineurin-mediated and PKA-independent fashion. Next, we investigated the involvement of calcineurin and CRTC2 in FSH and TGFβ1-stimulated steroidogenesis. Calcineurin and TGFβRI inhibitor dramatically reduced the FSH ± TGFβ1-increased progesterone synthesis and protein levels of StAR, P450scc, and 3β-HSD enzyme. Furthermore, chromatin-immunoprecipitation and immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that FSH ± TGFβ1 differentially increased CRTC2, CREB, and CBP binding to these steroidogenic genes, and CREB nuclear association with CRTC2 and CBP. In all, this study reveals for the first time that CRTC2 and calcineurin are critical signaling mediators in FSH and TGFβ1-stimulated steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cell.
 unique regulator, which catalyzes the conversion of a specific phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro-containing motif in target proteins. Herein, we identified CRTC2 as a Pin1-binding protein by overexpressing Pin1 with Myc and FLAG tags in mouse livers and subsequent purification of the complex containing Pin1. The association between Pin1 and CRTC2 was observed not only in overexpression experiments but also endogenously in the mouse liver. Interestingly, Ser(136) in the nuclear localization signal of CRTC2 was shown to be involved in the association with Pin1. Pin1 overexpression in HepG2 cells attenuated forskolin-induced nuclear localization of CRTC2 and cAMP-responsive element (CRE) transcriptional activity, whereas gene knockdown of Pin1 by siRNA enhanced both. Pin1 also associated with CRTC1, leading to their cytosol localization, essentially similar to the action of CRTC2. Furthermore, it was shown that CRTC2 associated with Pin1 did not bind to CREB. Taken together, these observations indicate the association of Pin1 with CRTC2 to decrease the nuclear CBP·CRTC·CREB complex. Indeed, adenoviral gene transfer of Pin1 into diabetic mice improved hyperglycemia in conjunction with normalizing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA expression levels, which is regulated by CRE transcriptional activity. In conclusion, Pin1 regulates CRE transcriptional activity, by associating with CRTC1 or CRTC.
olines (BCs) are potential endogenous and exogenous neurotoxins that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. However, we recently demonstrated protective and stimulatory effects of 9-methyl-BC (9-me-BC) in primary dopaminergic culture. In the present study, treatment with 9-me-BC unmasked a unique tetrad of effects. First, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression was stimulated in pre-existing dopa decarboxylase immunoreactive neurons and several TH-relevant transcription factors (Gata2, Gata3, Creb1, Crebbp) were up-regulated. Neurite outgrowth of TH immunoreactive (THir) neurons was likewise stimulated. The interaction with tyrosine kinases (protein kinase A and C, epidermal growth factor-receptor, fibroblast growth factor-receptor and neural cell adhesion molecule) turned out to be decisive for these observed effects. Second, 9-me-BC protected in acute toxicity models THir neurons against lipopolysaccharide and 2,9-dime-BC(+) toxicity. Third, in a chronic toxicity model when cells were treated with 9-me-BC after chronic rotenone administration, a pronounced regeneration of THir neurons was observed. Fourth, 9-me-BC inhibited the proliferation of microglia induced by toxin treatment and installed an anti-inflammatory environment by decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and receptors. Finally, 9-me-BC lowered the content of alpha-synuclein protein in the cultures. The presented results warrant the exploration of 9-me-BC as a novel potential anti-parkinsonian medication, as 9-me-BC interferes with several known pathogenic factors in Parkinson's disease as outlined above. Further investigations are currently under wa.
lanoma, clear cell sarcoma harbors either a t(12;22)(q13;q12) recurrent translocation, resulting in an EWSR1/ATF1 chimeric gene, or less commonly a t(2;22)(q34;q12) translocation fusing EWSR1 and CREB1. Few studies have examined the prevalence of all chimeric types and variants to assess the usage of ancillary genetic testing in routine diagnosis. We investigated rearrangement prevalence in 17 clear cell sarcomas, two positive control cell lines, and two melanomas (negative controls). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the LSI EWSR1 break-apart probe and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay optimized for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue to detect all four reported EWSR1/ATF1 clear cell sarcoma chimeric types and the EWSR1/CREB1 variant was performed. All 15 cases available for testing by FISH were positive for EWSR1 rearrangement including two cases with insufficient RNA for RT-PCR. Thirteen of 15 cases successfully tested by RT-PCR harbored a type 1 chimeric transcript (EWSR1 exon 8/ATF1 exon 4), of which five tumors simultaneously carried a type 2 chimeric transcript (EWSR1 exon 7/ATF1 exon 5). One case carried a type 2 transcript alone and one case contained an EWSR1/CREB1 transcript. Both control cases were positive by both techniques with one case carrying both types 1 and 2 chimeric transcripts and the other types 2 and 3 (EWSR1 exon 10/ATF1 exon 5). Consequently, both techniques are equally effective in assessing for an EWSR1 rearrangement and are useful ancillary diagnostic tests for clear cell sarcoma. They also reinforce the prevalence of this translocation in these tumors. In addition, EWSR1-CREB1 was identified in a clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue providing further evidence that this chimeric variant is not exclusive to gastrointestinal clear cell sarcomas and should be included in RT-PCR assays of soft tissue clear cell sarcoma.
in kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway plays integral roles in the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein that regulates steroid biosynthesis in steroidogenic cells. PKC can modulate the activity of cAMP/protein kinase A signaling involved in steroidogenesis; however, its mechanism remains obscure. In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of the PKC pathway, by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), was capable of potentiating dibutyryl cAMP [(Bu)(2)cAMP]-stimulated StAR expression, StAR phosphorylation, and progesterone synthesis in both mouse Leydig (MA-10) and granulosa (KK-1) tumor cells. The steroidogenic potential of PMA and (Bu)(2)cAMP was linked with phosphorylation of ERK 1/2; however, inhibition of the latter demonstrated varying effects on steroidogenesis. Transcriptional activation of the StAR gene by PMA and (Bu)(2)cAMP was influenced by several factors, its up-regulation being dependent on phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). An oligonucleotide probe containing a CREB/activating transcription factor binding region in the StAR promoter was found to bind nuclear proteins in PMA and (Bu)(2)cAMP-treated MA-10 and KK-1 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the induction of phosphorylated CREB was tightly correlated with in vivo protein-DNA interactions and recruitment of CREB binding protein to the StAR promoter. Ectopic expression of CREB binding protein enhanced CREB-mediated transcription of the StAR gene, an event that was markedly repressed by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. Further studies demonstrated that the activation of StAR expression and steroid synthesis by PMA and (Bu)(2)cAMP was associated with expression of the nuclear receptor Nur77, indicating its essential role in hormone-regulated steroidogenesis. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which PKC modulates cAMP/protein kinase A responsiveness involved in regulating the steroidogenic response in mouse gonadal cell.
rly fasting, increases in skeletal muscle proteolysis liberate free amino acids for hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to pancreatic glucagon. Hepatic glucose output diminishes during the late protein-sparing phase of fasting, when ketone body production by the liver supplies compensatory fuel for glucose-dependent tissues. Glucagon stimulates the gluconeogenic program by triggering the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2; also known as TORC2), while parallel decreases in insulin signalling augment gluconeogenic gene expression through the dephosphorylation and nuclear shuttling of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Here we show that a fasting-inducible switch, consisting of the histone acetyltransferase p300 and the nutrient-sensing deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), maintains energy balance in mice through the sequential induction of CRTC2 and FOXO1. After glucagon induction, CRTC2 stimulated gluconeogenic gene expression by an association with p300, which we show here is also activated by dephosphorylation at Ser 89 during fasting. In turn, p300 increased hepatic CRTC2 activity by acetylating it at Lys 628, a site that also targets CRTC2 for degradation after its ubiquitination by the E3 ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein (COP1). Glucagon effects were attenuated during late fasting, when CRTC2 was downregulated owing to SIRT1-mediated deacetylation and when FOXO1 supported expression of the gluconeogenic program. Disrupting SIRT1 activity, by liver-specific knockout of the Sirt1 gene or by administration of a SIRT1 antagonist, increased CRTC2 activity and glucose output, whereas exposure to SIRT1 agonists reduced them. In view of the reciprocal activation of FOXO1 and its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha, encoded by Ppargc1a) by SIRT1 activators, our results illustrate how the exchange of two gluconeogenic regulators during fasting maintains energy balanc.
xpression of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor (GRP-R) occurs frequently in human malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. Owing to paracrine and autocrine interaction with its specific high-affinity ligand GRP, tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion might ensue. Here we provide the first insights regarding molecular mechanisms of GRP-R regulation in gastrointestinal cancer cells. We identified by EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays two cAMP response element (CRE) binding sites that recruited transcription factor CRE binding protein (CREB) to the human GRP-R promoter. Transfection studies with a wild-type human GRP-R promoter reporter and corresponding CRE mutants showed that both CRE sites are critical for basal transcriptional activation in gastrointestinal cancer cells. Forced expression of cAMP-dependent effectors CREB and PKA resulted in robust upregulation of human GRP-R transcriptional activity, and this overexpression strictly required intact wild-type CRE sites. Direct cAMP stimulation with forskolin resulted in enhanced human GRP-R promoter activity only in HuTu-80 cells, but not in Caco-2 cells, coinciding with forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation occurring only in HuTu-80 but not Caco-2 cells. In summary, CREB is a critical regulator of human GRP-R expression in gastrointestinal cancer and might be activated through different upstream intracellular pathway.
rted microdeletions of the CREB-binding protein (CBP) gene in the Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a single cosmid probe specific to the 3' region of the gene. In order to test the hypothesis that the rate of microdeletion-positive cases would be greater if the entire gene was evaluated, we performed FISH on 66 patients with an established diagnosis of RTS, using a panel of five cosmids that span the CBP gene. Five of 66 patients had deletions by FISH (9%), consistent with those rates reported in various series that ranged between 3-25%. Among our cases, different deletions were observed; one was deleted for the 5' but not the 3' region of the CBP gene (case 055). Other deletions included a total CBP deletion extending from the 5' through the 3' region (case 017), a deletion of all but the 5' region (cases 006 and 060), and an interstitial deletion in the 3' region (case 028). Fine breakpoint mapping with additional cosmid and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) constructs was performed on these patients. The findings of a partial 5' deletion and of interstitial deletions of the CBP gene add to the known spectrum of mutations of this gene in RTS and demonstrate the need for evaluation of the entire CBP gene region for deletions rather than only the 3' region in RTS patients. These results further suggest that the true rate of microdeletion across the CBP gene detectable by FISH has yet to be established firmly. No phenotypic differences between partial deletion, complete deletion, and nondeletion patients were observed, supporting a haploinsufficiency model for RST.
has increasingly focused on the role of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding (CREB) protein in learning and memory, particularly its role in cognitive disorders and neurodegeneration, such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and Coffin-Lowry syndrome. The cognitive dysfunction of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which is widely recognized, is not completely in accordance with depressive severity, and the dysfunction persists upon clinical remission in some patients. However, few studies have focused on the role of CREB on cognitive function in patients with MDD. This study aimed to investigate the influence of CREB1 polymorphism on cognitive function in patients with MDD. The current study comprised 113 patients with MDD. The severity of depression was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and cognitive function was assessed using the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test, verbal fluency test, and tests of immediate logical memory and visual reproduction. All subjects were genotyped with regard to CREB1 polymorphisms (rs10932201, rs2551645, rs2254137, rs6740584, and rs2551640). For the verbal fluency test, the results showed significant differences for all single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypic groups. For the Stroop color-word task, a significant difference was found only for rs6740584. No significant differences were found for the Stroop color task, the immediate logical memory test or the visual reproduction test. In conclusion, there was an effect of CREB1 polymorphism on selective attention and retrieval of long-term memory, but not on immediate memor.
odel of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) was generated by an insertional mutation into the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) gene. Heterozygous CBP-deficient mice, which had truncated CBP protein (residues 1-1084) containing the CREB-binding domain (residues 462-661), showed clinical features of RTS, such as growth retardation (100%), retarded osseous maturation (100%), hypoplastic maxilla with narrow palate (100%), cardiac anomalies (15%) and skeletal abnormalities (7%). Truncated CBP is considered to have been acting during development as a dominant-negative inhibitor to lead to the phenotypes of RTS in mice. Our studies with step-through-type passive avoidance tests and with fear conditioning test showed that mice were deficient in long-term memory (LTM). In contrast, short-term memory (STM) appeared to be normal. These results implicate a crucial role for CBP in mammalian LTM. Our CBP +/- mice would be an excellent model for the study of the role of CBP in development and memory storage mechanism.
gic activation and angiogenesis are pivotal for myocardial function but the link between both events remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the cardiac angiogenesis profile in a mouse model with cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of β2-adrenoceptors (β2-TG), and the effect of cardiac pressure overload. β2-TG mice had heightened cardiac angiogenesis, which was essential for maintenance of the hypercontractile phenotype seen in this model. Relative to controls, cardiomyocytes of β2-TGs showed upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), heightened phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive-element-binding protein (CREB), and increased recruitment of phospho-CREB, CREB-binding protein (CBP), and p300 to the VEGF promoter. However, when hearts were subjected to pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), angiogenic signaling in β2-TGs was inhibited within 1&nbsp;week after TAC. β2-TG hearts, but not controls, exposed to pressure overload for 1-2&nbsp;weeks showed significant increases from baseline in phosphorylation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKIIδ) and protein expression of p53, reduction in CREB phosphorylation, and reduced abundance of phospho-CREB, p300 and CBP recruited to the CREB-responsive element (CRE) site of VEGF promoter. These changes were associated with reduction in both VEGF expression and capillary density. While non-TG mice with TAC developed compensatory hypertrophy, (2-TGs exhibited exaggerated hypertrophic growth at week-1 post-TAC, followed by LV dilatation and reduced fractional shortening measured by serial echocardiography. In conclusion, angiogenesis was enhanced by the cardiomyocyte (2AR/CREB/VEGF signaling pathway. Pressure overload rapidly inhibited this signaling, likely as a consequence of activated CaMKII and p53, leading to impaired angiogenesis and functional decompensatio.
sted state, increases in catecholamine signaling promote adipocyte function via the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). CREB activity is further up-regulated in obesity, despite reductions in catecholamine signaling, where it contributes to the development of insulin resistance. Here we show that obesity promotes the CREB binding protein (CBP)-mediated acetylation of CREB at Lys136 in adipose. Under lean conditions, CREB acetylation was low due to an association with the energy-sensing NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SirT1; amounts of acetylated CREB were increased in obesity, when SirT1 undergoes proteolytic degradation. Whereas CREB phosphorylation stimulated an association with the KIX domain of CBP, Lys136 acetylation triggered an interaction with the CBP bromodomain (BRD) that augmented recruitment of this coactivator to the promoter. Indeed, coincident Ser133 phosphorylation and Lys136 acetylation of CREB stimulated the formation of a ternary complex with the KIX and BRD domains of CBP by NMR analysis. As disruption of the CREB:BRD complex with a CBP-specific BRD inhibitor blocked effects of CREB acetylation on target gene expression, our results demonstrate how changes in nutrient status modulate cellular gene expression in response to hormonal signal.
pecies, including mice, maternal responsiveness is experience-dependent and permanent, lasting for long periods (months to years). We have shown that after brief exposures to pups, virgin female mice continue to respond maternally toward pups for at least one month. Administration of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) reduces the amount of maternal experience required to affect maternal behavior and gene expression. In this set of studies, we examined the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie these motivated behaviors. We assessed whether the effects of HDACi persisted 1 month after the initial experience (in the absence of continued pup experience or HDACi treatment) and whether the maintenance of maternal memory was associated with stable changes in gene expression. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we examined whether Esr2 and Oxt gene expression might be mediated by recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase cAMP response element binding protein (CBP) to their promoter regions after maternal memory consolidation. We report that HDACi treatment induced long-lasting changes in maternal responsiveness. Maternal learning was associated with increased recruitment of CBP to the Esr2 and Oxt gene promoters during the consolidation of maternal memory as well as a persistent increase in estrogen receptor-β (Esr2) mRNA and decreased expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a within the medial preoptic area. The consolidation of the maternal experience may involve the CBP recruitment and stable changes in gene expression, which maintain increased maternal responsiveness for long periods of tim.
flammatory cytokine Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α is implicated in a variety of skeletal muscle pathologies. Here, we have investigated how in vitro cotreatment of skeletal muscle C2C12 cells with β-agonists modulates the TNF-α-induced inflammatory program. We observed that C2C12 myotubes express functional TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) and β2-adrenoreceptors (β2-ARs). TNF-α activated the canonical Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), culminating in potent induction of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory genes. Cotreatment with the β-agonist isoproterenol potentiated the expression of inflammatory mediators, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and several chemokines. The enhanced production of chemotactic factors upon TNF-α/isoproterenol cotreatment was also suggested by the results from migrational analysis. Whereas we could not explain our observations by cytoplasmic crosstalk, we found that TNF-R1-and β2-AR-induced signalling cascades cooperate in the nucleus. Using the IL-6 promoter as a model, we demonstrated that TNF-α/isoproterenol cotreatment provoked phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, concomitant with enhanced promoter accessibility and recruitment of the NF-κB p65 subunit, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-binding protein (CBP) and RNA polymerase II. In summary, we show that β-agonists potentiate TNF-α action, via nuclear crosstalk, that promotes chromatin relaxation at selected gene promoters. Our data warrant further study into the mode of action of β-agonists and urge for caution in their use as therapeutic agents for muscular disorder.
P-response-element-binding protein) is an important transcription factor for the activation of a number of immediate early genes. CREB is phosphorylated on Ser133 by PKA (protein kinase A), promoting the recruitment of the co-activator proteins CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300; this has been proposed to increase the transcription of CREB-dependent genes. CREB is also phosphorylated on Ser133 by MSK1/2 (mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1/2) in cells in response to the activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling; however, the relevance of this to gene transcription has been controversial. To resolve this problem, we created a mouse with a Ser133 to alanine residue mutation in the endogenous Creb gene. Unlike the total CREB knockout, which is perinatally lethal, these mice were viable, but born at less than the expected Mendelian frequency on a C57Bl/6 background. Using embryonic fibroblasts from the S133A-knockin mice we show in the present study that Ser133 phosphorylation downstream of PKA is required for CBP/p300 recruitment. The requirement of Ser133 phosphorylation for the PKA-mediated induction of CREB-dependent genes was, however, promoter-specific. Furthermore, we show that in cells the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 by MSKs does not promote strong recruitment of CBP or p300. Despite this, MSK-mediated CREB phosphorylation is critical for the induction of CREB-dependent genes downstream of MAPK signallin.
se of this study is to identify target proteins that may play important functional roles in oral cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) using mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic.
rmation assays were performed on highly invasive UM1 and lowly invasive UM2 oral cancer cell lines, which were derived from the same tongue squamous cell carcinoma, to enrich CSCs. Quantitative proteomic analysis of CSC-like and non-CSC UM1 cells was carried out using tandem mass tagging and two-dimensional liquid chromatography with Orbitrap mass spectrometr.
cancer cells were found to be present in the highly invasive UM1 cell line but absent in the lowly invasive UM2 cell line. Stem cell markers SOX2, OCT4, SOX9 and CD44 were up-regulated, whereas HIF-1 alpha and PGK-1 were down-regulated in CSC-like UM1 cells versus non-CSC UM1 cells. Quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that many proteins in cell cycle, metabolism, G protein signal transduction, translational elongation, development, and RNA splicing pathways were differentially expressed between the two cell phenotypes. Both CREB-1-binding protein (CBP) and phosphorylated CREB-1 were found to be significantly over-expressed in CSC-like UM1 cell.
cells can be enriched from the highly invasive UM1 oral cancer cell line but not from the lowly invasive UM2 oral cancer cell line. There are significant proteomic alterations between CSC-like and non-CSC UM1 cells. In particular, CBP and phosphorylated CREB-1 were significantly up-regulated in CSC-like UM1 cells versus non-CSC UM1 cells, suggesting that the CREB pathway is activated in the CSC-like cell.
he successful application of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in multiple myeloma treatment, ATRA-induced chemoresistance in the myeloma patients is very common in clinic. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ATRA on the expression of apurinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (Ape/Ref-1) in the U266 and RPMI-8226 myeloma cells to explore the chemoresistance mechanism involved. ATRA treatment induced upregulation of Ape/Ref-1 via a noncanonical signaling pathway, leading to enhanced pro-survival activity counteracting melphalan (an alkylating agent). ATRA rapidly activated p38-MSK (mitogen- and stress activated protein kinase) cascade to phosphorylate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Phosphorylated CREB was recruited to the Ape/Ref-1 promoter to evoke the gene expression. The stimulation of ATRA on Ape/Ref-1 expression was attenuated by either p38-MSK inhibitors or overexpression of dominant-negative MSK1 mutants. Moreover, ATRA-mediated Ape/Ref-1 upregulation was correlated with histone modification and activation of CBP/p300, an important cofactors for CREB transcriptional activity. C646, a competitive CBP/p300 inhibitor, abolished the upregulation of Ape/Ref-1 induced by ATRA. Intriguingly, CBP rather than p300 played a dominant role in the expression of Ape/Ref-1. Hence, our study suggests the existence of a noncanonical mechanism involving p38-MSK-CREB cascade and CBP induction to mediate ATRA-induced Ape/Ref-1 expression and acquired chemoresistance in myeloma cell.
P response-element binding protein (CREB) is a stimulus-activated transcription factor. Its transcription activity requires its binding with CREB-binding protein (CBP) after CREB is phosphorylated at Ser133. The domains involved for CREB-CBP interaction are kinase-inducible domain (KID) from CREB and KID-interacting domain (KIX) from CBP. Recent studies suggest that CREB is an attractive target for novel cancer therapeutics. To identify novel chemotypes as inhibitors of KIX-KID interaction, we screened the NCI-diversity set of compounds using a split renilla luciferase assay and identified 2-[(7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio]pyridine 1-oxide (compound 1, NSC228155) as a potent inhibitor of KIX-KID interaction. However, compound 1 was not particularly selective against CREB-mediated gene transcription in living HEK 293T cells. Further structure-activityrelationship studies identified 4-aniline substituted nitrobenzofurazans with improved selectivit.
remarkable feature of the nervous system is that the development and functions of the brain are largely reshaped by postnatal experiences, in joint with genetic landscapes. The nature vs. nurture argument reminds us that both genetic and epigenetic information is indispensable for the normal function of the brain. The epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the central nervous system have been revealed over last a decade. Moreover, the mutations of epigenetic modulator genes have been shown to be implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. The epigenetic study has initiated in the neuroscience field for a relative short period of time. In this review, we will summarize recent discoveries about epigenetic regulation on neural development, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the comprehensive view of how epigenetic regulation contributes to the function of the brain is still not completed, the notion that brain, the most complicated organ of organisms, is profoundly shaped by epigenetic switches is widely accepte.
opin-releasing hormone (CRH) contributes crucially to the regulation of central and peripheral responses to stress. Because of the importance of a finely tuned stress system, CRH expression is tightly regulated in an organ- and brain region-specific manner. Thus, in the hypothalamus, CRH is constitutively expressed and this expression is further enhanced by stress; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. The regulatory region of the crh gene contains several elements, including the cyclic-AMP response element (CRE), and the role of the CRE interaction with the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in CRH expression has been a focus of intensive research. Notably, whereas thousands of genes contain a CRE, the functional regulation of gene expression by the CRE:CREB system is limited to ∼100 genes, and likely requires additional proteins. Here, we investigated the role of a member of the CREB complex, CREB binding protein (CBP), in basal and stress-induced CRH expression during development and in the adult. Using mice with a deficient CREB-binding site on CBP, we found that CBP:CREB interaction is necessary for normal basal CRH expression at the mRNA and protein level in the nine-day-old mouse, prior to onset of functional regulation of hypothalamic CRH expression by glucocorticoids. This interaction, which functions directly on crh or indirectly via regulation of other genes, was no longer required for maintenance of basal CRH expression levels in the adult. However, CBP:CREB binding contributed to stress-induced CRH expression in the adult, enabling rapid CRH synthesis in hypothalamus. CBP:CREB binding deficiency did not disrupt basal corticosterone plasma levels or acute stress-evoked corticosterone release. Because dysregulation of CRH expression occurs in stress-related disorders including depression, a full understanding of the complex regulation of this gene is important in both health and diseas.
nducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) plays a crucial role in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme tumors, which are characterized by their effective immune escape mechanisms. As major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) is involved in glioma immune evasion and since HIF-1α is a pivotal link between inflammation and glioma progression, the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-induced inflammation in MHC-I gene regulation was investigated. A TNF-α-induced increase in MHC-I expression and transcriptional activation was concurrent with increased HIF-1α, ΝF-κΒ, and β-catenin activities. While knockdown of HIF-1α and β-catenin abrogated TNF-α-induced MHC-I activation, NF-κB had no effect. β-Catenin inhibition abrogated HIF-1α activation and vice versa, and this HIF-1α-β-catenin axis positively regulated CREB phosphorylation. Increased CREB activation was accompanied by its increased association with β-catenin and CBP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased CREB enrichment at CRE/site α on the MHC-I promoter in a β-catenin-dependent manner. β-Catenin replaced human Brahma (hBrm) with Brg1 as the binding partner for CREB at the CRE site. The hBrm-to-Brg1 switch is crucial for MHC-I regulation, as ATPase-deficient Brg1 abolished TNF-α-induced MHC-I expression. β-Catenin also increased the association of MHC-I enhanceosome components RFX5 and NF-YB at the SXY module. CREB acts as a platform for assembling coactivators and chromatin remodelers required for MHC-I activation in a HIF-1α/β-catenin-dependent manne.
and memory are basic functions of the brain that allowed human evolution. It is well accepted that during learning and memory formation the dynamic establishment of new active synaptic connections is crucial. Persistent synaptic activation leads to molecular events that include increased release of neurotransmitters, increased expression of receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, thus creating a positive feedback that results in the activation of distinct signaling pathways that temporally and permanently alter specific patterns of gene expression. However, the epigenetic changes that allow the establishment of long term genetic programs that control learning and memory are not completely understood. Even less is known regarding the signaling events triggered by synaptic activity that regulate these epigenetic marks. Here we review the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling activity-dependent gene transcription leading synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We describe how Ca(2+) entry through N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate neurotransmitter receptors result in the activation of specific signaling pathways leading to changes in gene expression, giving special emphasis to the recent data pointing out different epigenetic mechanisms (histone acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation as well as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation) underlying learning and memor.
evidence indicates that the balance between pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (AICs) within the brain is an important determinant in the outcome of hypertension. However, the mechanism by which this dysregulation occurs is not known. We aimed to investigate whether AngII induces imbalance between PIC and AIC by modulating downstream transcription factors, NFκB and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and whether AngII-induced effects are mediated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β.
urons were exposed to AngII (10 nM-1 μM) over a preset time course. In another set of experiments, GSK-3β was knock down by using lentivirus containing short hairpin RNA targeting GSK-3β (L-sh-GSK3β) before AngII exposure. Cell extracts were subjected to RT-PCR, immunoblot and immunoprecipitatio.
sed time-dependent increase in PICs (TNF-α and IL-1β) and reduction in AIC (IL-10). AngII exposure caused reduced phosphorylated CREB(Ser-133) and increased p-NFκB(Ser-276) levels, leading to reduced CREB-CBP and increased NFκB-CBP binding. These results were accompanied by increased activation of GSK-3β, as indicated by increased p-GSK3(Tyr-216) to p-GSK3(Ser-9) ratio. In a subsequent study, pretreatment with L-sh-GSK3β attenuated AngII-induced alterations in PICs and IL-10 by augmenting CREB-CBP and attenuating NFκB-CBP bindin.
ely, these findings are the first to provide direct evidence that AngII-induced dysregulation in cytokines is mediated by GSK-3β-mediated alterations in downstream transcription factors in neuronal cells. Our data also reveal that AngII-induced effects could be alleviated by GSK-3β inhibition, suggesting GSK-3β as an important therapeutic target for hypertension that is characterized by increased PICs and NFκB activatio.
 aversive long-term memory (LTM) formation in Drosophila requires multiple spaced trainings, whereas appetitive LTM can be formed after a single training. Appetitive LTM requires fasting prior to training, which increases motivation for food intake. However, we found that fasting facilitated LTM formation in general; aversive LTM formation also occurred after single-cycle training when mild fasting was applied before training. Both fasting-dependent LTM (fLTM) and spaced training-dependent LTM (spLTM) required protein synthesis and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) activity. However, spLTM required CREB activity in two neural populations--mushroom body and DAL neurons--whereas fLTM required CREB activity only in mushroom body neurons. fLTM uses the CREB coactivator CRTC, whereas spLTM uses the coactivator CBP. Thus, flies use distinct LTM machinery depending on their hunger stat.
mine diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of a CAG repeat that encodes polyglutamine in each respective disease gene. The transcription factor THAP11, a member of THAP family, is involved in cell growth, ES cell pluripotency and embryogenesis. Previous studies suggest that THAP11 protein contains a 29-residue repeat polyglutamine motif and the number of polyglutamine ranges from 20 to 41 in Indian population. We have investigated the CAG numbers at the THAP11 locus in normal individuals and neurodegenerative disease patients of Chinese Han population and a 38Q expansion (THAP11(38Q)) was found in patients. Using fluorescence confocal-based cell imaging, THAP11(38Q) protein formed intranuclear inclusions easier than THAP11(29Q) in PC12 cells. Enhanced toxicity was investigated in THAP11(38Q)-expressing cells by growth inhibition and G0/G1 arrest. CREB-mediated transcription activity was inhibited by THAP11(38Q). The transcription factor, TBP, coactivator CBP, and chaperon protein, HSP70, could be recruited to THAP11(38Q). These results indicate that expansion of the polyglutamine in THAP11 forms intracellular aggregation and is toxic in PC12 cells, suggesting a putative role of THAP11 in polyglutamine diseas.
tudy, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and hypoxia inducible factor-1β (HIF-1β) from small abalone Haliotis diversicolor were cloned. The cDNA of H. diversicolor HIF-1α (HdHIF-1α) is 2,833 bp encoding a protein of 711aa and H. diversicolor HIF-1β (HdHIF-1β) is 1919 bp encoding a protein of 590aa. Similar to other species' HIF-1, HdHIF-1 has one basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and two Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains, and HdHIF-1α has a oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) with two proline hydroxylation motifs and a C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) with an asparagine hydroxylation motif. Under normoxic conditions, HdHIF-1α and HdHIF-1β mRNAs were constitutively present in all examined tissues. Under hypoxia (2.0mg/L DO at 25°C) stress, HdHIF-1α expression was up-regulated in gills at 4h, 24h and 96 h, and in hemocytes at 24h and 96 h, while HdHIF-1β remained relatively constant. Under thermal stress (31°C), HdHIF-1α expression was significantly increased in gills at 4h, and hemocytes at 0 h and 4 h, while HdHIF-1β expression still remained relatively constant. These results suggested that HIF-1α may play an important role in adaption to poor environment in H. diversicolo.
abilization following encoding (synaptic consolidation) or memory reactivation (reconsolidation) requires gene expression and protein synthesis (Dudai and Eisenberg, 2004; Tronson and Taylor, 2007; Nader and Einarsson, 2010; Alberini, 2011). Although consolidation and reconsolidation may be mediated by distinct molecular mechanisms (Lee et al., 2004), disrupting the function of the transcription factor CREB impairs both processes (Kida et al., 2002; Mamiya et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 recruits CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 coactivators to activate transcription (Chrivia et al., 1993; Parker et al., 1996). In addition to this well known mechanism, CREB regulated transcription coactivators (CRTCs), previously called transducers of regulated CREB (TORC) activity, stimulate CREB-mediated transcription, even in the absence of CREB phosphorylation. Recently, CRTC1 has been shown to undergo activity-dependent trafficking from synapses and dendrites to the nucleus in excitatory hippocampal neurons (Ch'ng et al., 2012). Despite being a powerful and specific coactivator of CREB, the role of CRTC in memory is virtually unexplored. To examine the effects of increasing CRTC levels, we used viral vectors to locally and acutely increase CRTC1 in the dorsal hippocampus dentate gyrus region of mice before training or memory reactivation in context fear conditioning. Overexpressing CRTC1 enhanced both memory consolidation and reconsolidation; CRTC1-mediated memory facilitation was context specific (did not generalize to nontrained context) and long lasting (observed after virally expressed CRTC1 dissipated). CREB overexpression produced strikingly similar effects. Therefore, increasing CRTC1 or CREB function is sufficient to enhance the strength of new, as well as established reactivated, memories without compromising memory qualit.
lic AMP-response element binding protein) is a downstream transcription factor of a multitude of signaling pathways emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors. CREB is not activated until it is phosphorylated at Ser133 and its subsequent binding to CREB-binding protein (CBP) through kinase-inducible domain (KID) in CREB and KID-interacting (KIX) domain in CBP. Tumor tissues from various organs present higher level of expression and activation of CREB. Thus CREB has been proposed as a promising cancer drug target. We previously described naphthol AS-E (1a) as a small molecule inhibitor of CREB-mediated gene transcription in living cells. Here we report the structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of 1a by modifying the appendant phenyl ring. All the compounds were evaluated for in vitro inhibition of KIX-KID interaction, cellular inhibition of CREB-mediated gene transcription and inhibition of proliferation of four cancer cell lines (A549, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468). SAR indicated that a small and electron-withdrawing group was preferred at the para-position for KIX-KID interaction inhibition. Compound 1a was selected for further biological characterization and it was found that 1a down-regulated the expression of endogenous CREB target genes. Expression of a constitutively active CREB mutant, VP16-CREB in MCF-7 cells rendered the cells resistant to 1a, suggesting that CREB was critical in mediating its anticancer activity. Furthermore, 1a was not toxic to normal human cells. Collectively, these data support that 1a represents a structural template for further development into potential cancer therapeutics with a novel mechanism of actio.
ause of fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus is unregulated hepatic glucose production (HGP). Insulin suppresses HGP by phosphorylating CBP and disassembling the CREB-CBP complex from gluconeogenic genes. p300 is closely related to CBP; but in contrast to CBP, p300 binds constitutively to CREB due to the absence of phosphorylation site found in CBP. In a phosphorylation-competent p300(G442S) knock-in mouse model, we demonstrate that HGP is now exquisitely sensitive to insulin suppression. p300(G422S) and hepatic-deleted p300 mice exhibited significant lower blood glucose levels in the fasted and post-prandial states, indicating a role for p300 in maintaining basal HG.
one receptors (PR) are emerging as important breast cancer drivers. Phosphorylation events common to breast cancer cells impact PR transcriptional activity, in part by direct phosphorylation. PR-B but not PR-A isoforms are phosphorylated on Ser294 by mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Phospho-Ser294 PRs are resistant to ligand-dependent Lys388 SUMOylation (that is, a repressive modification). Antagonism of PR small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation by mitogenic protein kinases suggests a mechanism for derepression (that is, transcriptional activation) of target genes. As a broad range of PR protein expression is observed clinically, a PR gene signature would provide a valuable marker of PR contribution to early breast cancer progressio.
ne expression patterns were measured in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressing either wild-type (SUMOylation-capable) or K388R (SUMOylation-deficient) PRs and subjected to pathway analysis. Gene sets were validated by RT-qPCR. Recruitment of coregulators and histone methylation levels were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Changes in cell proliferation and survival were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and western blotting. Finally, human breast tumor cohort datasets were probed to identify PR-associated gene signatures; metagene analysis was employed to define survival rates in patients whose tumors express a PR gene signatur.
sitive' PR target genes primarily include genes required for proliferative and pro-survival signaling. DeSUMOylated K388R receptors are preferentially recruited to enhancer regions of derepressed genes (that is, MSX2, RGS2, MAP1A, and PDK4) with the steroid receptor coactivator, CREB-(cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP), and mixed lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2), a histone methyltransferase mediator of nucleosome remodeling. PR SUMOylation blocks these events, suggesting that SUMO modification of PR prevents interactions with mediators of early chromatin remodeling at 'closed' enhancer regions. SUMO-deficient (phospho-Ser294) PR gene signatures are significantly associated with human epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2)-positive luminal breast tumors and predictive of early metastasis and shortened survival. Treatment with antiprogestin or MEK inhibitor abrogated expression of SUMO-sensitive PR target-genes and inhibited proliferation in BT-474 (estrogen receptor (ER)+/PR+/ERBB2+) breast cancer cell.
de that reversible PR SUMOylation/deSUMOylation profoundly alters target gene selection in breast cancer cells. Phosphorylation-induced PR deSUMOylation favors a permissive chromatin environment via recruitment of CBP and MLL2. Patients whose ER+/PR+ tumors are driven by hyperactive (that is, derepressed) phospho-PRs may benefit from endocrine (antiestrogen) therapies that contain an antiprogesti.
n of glucose transporter (GLUT) expression and activity plays a vital role in the supply of glucose to embryonic stem (ES) cell.
e the effect of 6-phenyl cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) on glucose uptake and cell proliferation, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation were carried ou.
T isoforms in mouse ES cells, GLUT1 was predominantly expressed and 6-phenyl cAMP increased GLUT mRNA levels. Among cAMP agonists, 6-phenyl cAMP increased 2-DG uptake more than that of 8-p-chlorophenylthio-2'-O-methyl-cAMP. 6-Phenyl cAMP increased GLUT1 expression and translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. 6-Phenyl cAMP increased 2-DG uptake in a time- and concentration-dependent manner due to an increase in V(max) but not K(m). 6-Phenyl cAMP increased phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and cAMP response element binding (CREB) and expression of the CREB protein (CBP) and transducer of regulated CREB activity 2 (TORC2) in sequence. 6-Phenyl cAMP induced complex formation of NF-κB/CREB/CBP/TORC2, which are involved in the increase of gluconeogenic enzyme expression. 6-Phenyl cAMP also increased cell cycle regulatory protein expression levels, the proportion of S-phase cells, and proto-oncogene expression via protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent NF-κB signaling. Finally, GLUT1 siRNA blocked the 6-phenyl cAMP-induced increase in ES cell proliferation. We conclude that PKA stimulated the complex formation of CREB/CBP/TORC2 via NF-κB, which induced effective coordination of glucose uptake as well as proliferation in ES cell.
cAMP-induced PKA activation modified the proliferation, which may be beneficial for expanding ES cell use to cell therap.
studies shows that connexins appear very early during murine embryo development, the gap junctional intercellular communication found in the inner cell mass of early embryo is also maintained in embryonic stem cells (ESC), and expression of oxytocin receptor (OTR) is developmentally regulated at early embryonic development. However, effect of oxytocin (OT) on the regulation of the connexin43 (Cx43) and maintenance of undifferentiation is not fully understood in stem cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of OT on Cx43 expression and related signaling cascades in mouse ESC. OT increased Cx43 expression that was inhibited by the OTR inhibitor atosiban. In experiments to examine whether the effect of OT depends on lipid rafts, caveolin-1 (cav-1), cav-2, and flotillin-2, but not OTR, were detected in lipid raft fractions. Also, colocalization of OTR, cav-1, and cav-2 was not detected. Moreover, the lipid raft disruptor methyl-β-cyclodextrin did not attenuate OT-induced Cx43 expression. In experiments to examine related signaling pathways, OT activated cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) which was inhibited by adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 and PKA inhibitor PKI. OT increased nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) phosphorylation which was inhibited by PKI. OT also increased cAMP response element-binding (CREB)/CREB-binding protein (CBP) expression in the nucleus and induced the formation of CREB1/NF-κB/CBP complexes, which was blocked by the NF-κB-specific small interfering RNA, NF-κB inhibitors, SN50, and bay11-7082. Complex disruption by NF-κB inhibitors decreased OT-induced Cx43 expression. In conclusion, OT stimulates Cx43 expression through the NF-κB/CREB/CBP complex via the lipid raft-independent OTR-mediated cAMP/PKA in mouse ES.
estinal inflammation is mediated by the pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-8 (IL-8) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2) ). PGE(2) binding and coupling through EP2/4 receptor subtypes on colonic epithelial cells stimulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and IL-8 production. Here we determined the mechanisms whereby PGE(2) regu-lates IL-8 in Caco2 colonic epithelial cells and in cells over-expressing the EP2/4 receptors (EP2S/EP4S). PGE(2) coupling through EP2 activated the transcription factor inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), whereas coupling through EP4 receptors activated the cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Activation of CREB in Caco2/EP2S was protein kinase A (PKA) dependent, whereas in EP4S cells, activation of CREB occurred through the PKA and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. Since ICER lacks the transactivation domain, it functions as a transcription repressor as opposed to CREB. PGE(2) coupling through EP2/4 receptors can therefore acts in an opposing manner to either decrease (EP2) or promote IL-8 expression by recruiting CREB-binding protein (CBP) (EP4), which formed a multiprotein IL-8 enhanceosome. A novel half CRE (167CRE) and a composite NFAT1-AP1-like site in the IL-8 promoter participated in binding and complex formation as confirmed by mutagenesis and expression studies. These data unravel the mechanisms by which expression of IL-8 is controlled by different signalling pathways that are activated by PGE(2) but acting through different EP receptor.
eveloped a protein knockdown technology using hybrid small molecules designed as conjugates of a ligand for the target protein and a ligand for ubiquitin ligase cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1). However, this technology has several limitations. Here, we report the development of a novel protein knockdown system to address these limitations. In this system, target proteins are fused with HaloTag to provide a common binding site for a degradation inducer. We designed and synthesized small molecules consisting of alkyl chloride as the HaloTag-binding degradation inducer, which binds to HaloTag, linked to BE04 (), which binds to cIAP1. Using this system, we successfully knocked down HaloTag-fused cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (HaloTag-CREB1) and HaloTag-fused c-jun (HaloTag-c-jun), which are ligand-unknown nuclear proteins, in living cells. HaloTag-binding degradation inducers can be synthesized easily, and are expected to be useful as biological tools for pan-degradation of HaloTag-fused protein.
fied a neuroprotective single fraction among 62 ones of hexane extract from Uncaria sinensis (JGH43IA) and investigated its effects and mechanisms in primary cortical neurons. Pretreatment with JGH43IA showed a significantly increase cell viability in a dose-dependent manner with a decrease in the lactate dehydrogenase release. When we performed morphological assay and flow cytometry to determination of the type of cell death, pretreatment with JGH43IA showed a significant reduction of glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death. Then we explored the downstream signaling pathways of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) with calpain activation to elucidate possible pathways of neuroprotection by JGH43IA. Pretreatment with JGH43IA exhibited a significant attenuation of NMDAR GluN2B subunit activation and a decrease in active form of calpain 1 leading to subsequent cleavage of striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). In addition, pretreatment with JGH43IA showed a marked increase of cAMP responsive element binding protein. These results suggest that JGH43IA may have neuroprotective effects through down-regulation of NMDAR GluN2B subunit and calpain 1 activation, and subsequent alleviation of STEP cleavage. This single fraction from U. sinensis might be a useful therapeutic agent for brain disorder associated with glutamate injur.
ften hijack cellular pathways to facilitate infection and replication. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic gammaherpesvirus etiologically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, a vascular tumor of endothelial cells. Despite intensive studies, cellular pathways mediating KSHV infection and replication are still not well defined. Using an antibody array approach, we examined cellular proteins phosphorylated during primary KSHV infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Enrichment analysis identified integrin/mitogen-activated protein kinase (integrin/MAPK), insulin/epidermal growth factor receptor (insulin/EGFR), and JAK/STAT as the activated networks during primary KSHV infection. The transcriptional factor CREB1 (cyclic AMP [cAMP]-responsive element-binding protein 1) had the strongest increase in phosphorylation. While knockdown of CREB1 had no effect on KSHV entry and trafficking, it drastically reduced the expression of lytic transcripts and proteins and the production of infectious virions. Chemical activation of CREB1 significantly enhanced viral lytic replication. In contrast, CREB1 neither influenced the expression of the latent gene LANA nor affected KSHV infectivity. Mechanistically, CREB1 was not activated through the classic cAMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) pathway or via the AKT, MK2, and RSK pathways. Rather, CREB1 was activated by the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases 1 and 2 (MSK1/2). Consequently, chemical inhibition or knockdown of MSKs significantly inhibited the KSHV lytic replication program; however, it had a minimal effect on LANA expression and KSHV infectivity. Together, these results identify the MSK1/2-CREB1 proteins as novel essential effectors of KSHV lytic replication during primary infection. The differential effect of the MSK1/2-CREB1 pathway on the expression of viral latent and lytic genes might control the robustness of viral lytic replication, and therefore the KSHV replication program, during primary infectio.
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human tumor virus associated with several cancers. Through genome-wide kinase screening, we found that KSHV activates the MSK1/2-CREB1 pathway during primary infection and that it depends on this pathway for viral lytic replication. Inhibition of this pathway blocks KSHV lytic replication. These results illustrate a mechanism by which KSHV hijacks a cellular pathway for its replication, and they identify a potential therapeutic targe.
nding antinociceptive system (DAS) is thought to play crucial roles in the antinociceptive effect of spinal cord stimulation (SCS), especially through its serotonergic pathway. The nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) in the rostral ventromedial medulla is a major source of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] to the DAS, but the role of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the ventral periaqueductal gray matter is still unclear. Moreover, the influence of the noradrenergic pathway is largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the involvement of these serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways in SCS-induced antinociception by behavioral analysis of spinal nerve-ligated (SNL) rats. We also investigated immunohistochemical changes in the DRN and locus coeruleus (LC), regarded as the adrenergic center of the DAS, and expression changes of synthetic enzymes of 5-HT [tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)] and norepinephrine [dopamine β-hydroxylase (DβH)] in the spinal dorsal hor.
ally administered methysergide, a 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-receptor antagonist, and idazoxan, an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, equally abolished the antinociceptive effect of SCS. The numbers of TPH-positive serotonergic and phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB)-positive neurons and percentage of pCREB-positive serotonergic neurons in the DRN significantly increased after 3-h SCS. Further, the ipsilateral-to-contralateral immunoreactivity ratio of DβH increased in the LC of SNL rats and reached the level seen in naïve rats, even though the number of pCREB-positive neurons in the LC was unchanged by SNL and SCS. Moreover, 3-h SCS did not increase the expression levels of TPH and DβH in the spinal dorsal hor.
onergic and noradrenergic pathways of the DAS are involved in the antinociceptive effect of SCS, but activation of the DRN might primarily be responsible for this effect, and the LC may have a smaller contribution. SCS does not potentiate the synthetic enzymes of 5HT and norepinephrine in the neuropathic spinal cor.
ing Growth Factor β1 (TGF-β1) is a well-known neuroprotective and neurotrophic factor demonstrated to play a role in synaptic transmission. However, its involvement in physiological mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and memory at hippocampal level has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we examine the role of TGF-β1 in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory in adult wild type mice. Our data provide evidence that administration of exogenous TGF-β1 is able to convert early-phase-LTP into late-phase-LTP. Furthermore, we show that the block of the endogenous TGF-β1 signaling pathway by the specific TGF-β1 inhibitor SB431542, impairs LTP and object recognition memory. The latter impairment was rescued by administration of exogenous TGF-β1, suggesting that endogenously produced TGF-β1 plays a role in physiological mechanisms underlying LTP and memory. Finally, TGF-β1 functional effect correlates with an increased expression of the phosphorylated transcription factor cAMP-Responsive Element Binding protei.
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within gene promoter region or enhancers can modify the transcription rate of genes related to complex diseases. These SNPs can be called regulatory SNPs (rSNPs). Data compiled from recent projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project and ENCODE, has revealed essential information used to perform in silico prediction of the molecular and biological repercussions of SNPs within TFBS. However, most of these studies are very limited, as they only analyze SNPs in coding regions or when applied to promoters, and do not integrate essential biological data like TFBSs, expression profiles, pathway analysis, homotypic redundancy (number of TFBSs for the same TF in a region), chromatin accessibility and others, which could lead to a more accurate prediction. Our aim was to integrate different data in a biologically coherent method to analyze the proximal promoter regions of two antimicrobial peptide genes, DEFB1 and CAMP, that are associated with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS. We predicted SNPs within the promoter regions that are more likely to interact with transcription factors (TFs). We also assessed the impact of homotypic redundancy using a novel approach called the homotypic redundancy weight factor (HWF). Our results identified 10 SNPs, which putatively modify the binding affinity of 24 TFs previously identified as related to TB and HIV/AIDS expression profiles (e.g. KLF5, CEBPA and NFKB1 for TB; FOXP2, BRCA1, CEBPB, CREB1, EBF1 and ZNF354C for HIV/AIDS; and RUNX2, HIF1A, JUN/AP-1, NR4A2, EGR1 for both diseases). Validating with the OregAnno database and cell-specific functional/non functional SNPs from additional 13 genes, our algorithm performed 53% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity to detect functional rSNPs using the DNAseI-HUP database. We are proposing our algorithm as a novel in silico method to detect true functional rSNPs in antimicrobial peptide genes. With further improvement, this novel method could be applied to other promoters in order to design probes and to discover new drug targets for complex disease.
g and predicting evolutionary changes underlying current environmental modifications are complex challenges. Recent approaches to achieve these objectives include assessing the genetic variation and effects of candidate genes on traits indicating adaptive potential. In birds, for example, short tandem repeat polymorphism at four candidate genes (CLOCK, NPAS2, ADCYAP1, and CREB1) has been linked to variation in phenological traits such as laying date and timing of migration. However, our understanding of their importance as evolutionary predictors is still limited, mainly because the extent of genotype-environment interactions (GxE) related to these genes has yet to be assessed. Here, we studied a population of Tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) over 4&nbsp;years in southern Québec (Canada) to assess the relationships between those four candidate genes and two phenological traits related to reproduction (laying date and incubation duration) and also determine the importance of GxE in this system. Our results showed that NPAS2 female genotypes were nonrandomly distributed across the study system and formed a longitudinal cline with longer genotypes located to the east. We observed relationships between length polymorphism at all candidate genes and laying date and/or incubation duration, and most of these relationships were affected by environmental variables (breeding density, latitude, or temperature). In particular, the positive relationships detected between laying date and both CLOCK and NPAS2 female genotypes were variable depending on breeding density. Our results suggest that all four candidate genes potentially affect timing of breeding in birds and that GxE are more prevalent and important than previously reported in this contex.
n is a serious and potentially life-threatening mental disorder with unknown etiology. Emerging evidence shows that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the etiology of depression. However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Expression of miR-182 and BDNF in the hippocampus were analyzed in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. Male Wistar rats received bilateral intra-hippocampal infusions of BDNF- and miR-182-expressing (miR-182) or miR-182-silencers (si-miR-182) lentiviral vectors (LV). miR-182 upregulation was correlated with decreased BDNF expression in the hippocampus of a CUMS model. Accordingly, an anti-depressant like effect was observed when LV-BDNF or LV-si-miR-182 was injected into the hippocampus. Moreover, BDNF and its target gene cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) decreased following LV-miR-182 injection and increased upon LV-si-miR-182 injection in rat hippocampus and cultured neuronal cells. In contrast, miR-182 overexpression exacerbated depression-like behaviors and decreased BDNF. Further, luciferase reporter evidence confirmed BDNF was a miR-182 target. Taken together, the current results reveal a potential molecular regulation of miR-182 on BDNF and the pronounced behavioral consequences of this regulatio.
diol (E2)-dependent cell proliferation requires both estrogen receptor α (ERα)-based integrated control of gene transcription and kinase pathways activation. Such coordination of intracellular E2:ERα-dependent signaling mechanisms is finely tuned by receptor association with specific partner proteins. Recently, we identified the leucine (L) 429 and alanine (A) 430 within the ERα ligand binding domain as important residues for receptor non-covalent interaction to ubiquitinated species [i.e., ERα ubiquitin-binding surface (ERα UBS)] and for E2-induced ERα activation. To date, if these two ERα amino acids are involved in the control of E2-dependent pathways required for cell proliferation is unknown. Here, by using stably expressing ERα mutated in L429 and A430 (i.e., L429A,A430G - LAAG) cell lines, we show that L429 and A430 are critical for E2-induced cell proliferation, PI3K/AKT pathway activation, and ERα-mediated transcriptional changes. Moreover, we demonstrate that these two receptor structural determinants direct the E2-induced PI3K/AKT/CREB1 pathway activation and CREB1-mediated transcriptional activity that in turn control the hormone-induced cell proliferation. As a whole, our data demonstrate for the first time that the ERα UBS contributes to the modulation of E2-induced ERα-mediated cell proliferation and provide a novel connection between the receptor structure and the functional molecular mechanisms by which E2:ERα complex can regulate cell processe.
ory network in the human brain mediating lithium response in bipolar patients was revealed by analysis of functional SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and published gene association studies, followed by epigenome mappin.
l set of 23,312 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with lead SNPs, and sub-threshold GWAS SNPs rescued by pathway analysis, were studied in the same populations. These were assessed using our workflow and annotation by the epigenome roadmap consortiu.
ven percent of 802 SNPs that were associated with lithium response (13 published studies gene association studies and two GWAS) were shared in common with 1281 SNPs from 18 GWAS examining psychiatric disorders and adverse events associated with lithium treatment.&nbsp;Nineteen SNPs were annotated as active regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters in a tissue-specific manner. They were located within noncoding regions of ten genes: ANK3, ARNTL, CACNA1C, CACNG2, CDKN1A, CREB1, GRIA2, GSK3B, NR1D1 and SLC1A2. Following gene set enrichment and pathway analysis, these genes were found to be significantly associated (p = 10(-27); Fisher exact test) with an AMPA2 glutamate receptor network in human brain. Our workflow results showed concordance with annotation of regulatory elements from the epigenome roadmap. Analysis of cognate mRNA and enhancer RNA exhibited patterns consistent with an integrated pathway in humanbrai.
macoepigenomic regulatory pathway is located in the same brain regions that exhibit tissue volume loss in bipolar disorder. Although in silico analysis requires biological validation, the approach provides value for identification of candidate&nbsp;variants that may be used in pharmacogenomic testing to identify bipolar patients likely to respond to lithiu.
 isolated from the traditional medical plant Rhizoma Curcumae, is the bioactive component of Zedoary oil, whose potential anti-tumor effect has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Though many researchers have reported curcumol and its bioactivity, the potential molecular mechanism for its anti-cancer effect in colorectal cancer LoVo cells still remains unclear. In the present study, we found that curcumol showed growth inhibition and induced apoptosis of LoVo cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The occurrence of its proliferation inhibition and apoptosis came with suppression of IGF-1R expression, and then increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), which might result in a cascade response by inhibiting the CREB survival pathway and finally triggered Bax/Bcl-2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) apoptosis signals. Moreover, curcumol inhibited colorectal cancer in xenograft models of nude mice. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis revealed that curcumol could decrease the expression of ki-67, Bcl-2 as well as CREB1, and increase the expression of Bax and the phosphorylation of p38, which were consistent with our in vitro study. Overall, our in vitro and in vivo data confirmed the anti-cancer activity of curcumol, which was related to a significant inhibition of IGF-1R and activation of p38 MAPKs, indicating that curcumol may be a potential anti-tumor agent for colorectal carcinoma therap.
pression levels of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) are a critical determinant of HIV/AIDS susceptibility, and manifest wide variations (i) between T-cell subsets and among individuals and (ii) in T-cell activation-induced increases in expression levels. We demonstrate that a unifying mechanism for this variation is differences in constitutive and T-cell activation-induced DNA methylation status of CCR5 cis-regulatory regions (cis-regions). Commencing at an evolutionarily conserved CpG (CpG -41), CCR5 cis-regions manifest lower vs. higher methylation in T cells with higher vs. lower CCR5 levels (memory vs. naïve T cells) and in memory T cells with higher vs. lower CCR5 levels. HIV-related and in vitro induced T-cell activation is associated with demethylation of these cis-regions. CCR5 haplotypes associated with increased vs. decreased gene/surface expression levels and HIV/AIDS susceptibility magnify vs. dampen T-cell activation-associated demethylation. Methylation status of CCR5 intron 2 explains a larger proportion of the variation in CCR5 levels than genotype or T-cell activation. The ancestral, protective CCR5-HHA haplotype bears a polymorphism at CpG -41 that is (i) specific to southern Africa, (ii) abrogates binding of the transcription factor CREB1 to this cis-region, and (iii) exhibits a trend for overrepresentation in persons with reduced susceptibility to HIV and disease progression. Genotypes lacking the CCR5-Δ32 mutation but with hypermethylated cis-regions have CCR5 levels similar to genotypes heterozygous for CCR5-Δ32. In HIV-infected individuals, CCR5 cis-regions remain demethylated, despite restoration of CD4+ counts (≥800 cells per mm(3)) with antiretroviral therapy. Thus, methylation content of CCR5 cis-regions is a central epigenetic determinant of T-cell CCR5 levels, and possibly HIV-related outcome.
alignant mesothelioma (DMM) is a tumor of serosal membranes with propensity for progressive local disease. Because current treatment options are largely ineffective, novel therapeutic strategies based on molecular mechanisms and the disease characteristics are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with this disease. Akt kinase interacting protein 1 (Aki1; Freud-1/CC2D1A) is a scaffold protein for the PI3K-PDK1-Akt signaling module that helps determine receptor signal selectivity for EGFR. Aki1 has been suggested as a therapeutic target, but its potential has yet to be evaluated in a tumor setting. Here, we report evidence supporting its definition as a therapeutic target in DMM. In cell-based assays, Aki1 silencing decreased cell viability and caused cell-cycle arrest of multiple DMM cell lines via effects on the PKA-CREB1 signaling pathway. Blocking CREB activity phenocopied Aki1 silencing. Clinically, Aki1 was expressed in most human DMM specimens where its expression correlated with phosphorylated CREB1. Notably, Aki1 siRNA potently blocked tumor growth in an orthotopic implantation model of DMM when administered directly into the pleural cavity of tumor-bearing mice. Our findings suggest an important role for the Aki1-CREB axis in DMM pathogenesis and provide a preclinical rationale to target Aki1 by intrathoracic therapy in locally advanced tumors.

of this study was to identify unknown transcription start sites of the PPARGC1A (PGC-1α) gene in human skeletal muscle and investigate the promoter-specific regulation of PGC-1α gene expression in human skeletal muscle. Ten amateur endurance-trained athletes performed high- and low-intensity exercise sessions (70 min, 70% or 50% o2max). High-throughput RNA sequencing and exon-exon junction mapping were applied to analyse muscle samples obtained at rest and after exercise. PGC-1α promoter-specific expression and activation of regulators of PGC-1α gene expression (AMPK, p38 MAPK, CaMKII, PKA and CREB1) after exercise were evaluated using qPCR and western blot. Our study has demonstrated that during post-exercise recovery, human skeletal muscle expresses the PGC-1α gene via two promoters only. As previously described, the additional exon 7a that contains a stop codon was found in all samples. Importantly, only minor levels of other splice site variants were found (and not in all samples). Constitutive expression PGC-1α gene occurs via the canonical promoter, independent of exercise intensity and exercise-induced increase of AMPK(Thr172) phosphorylation level. Expression of PGC-1α gene via the alternative promoter is increased of two orders after exercise. This post-exercise expression is highly dependent on the intensity of exercise. There is an apparent association between expression via the alternative promoter and activation of CREB.
te apoptosis is largely responsible for cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA). Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is widely used as a chondrocyte apoptosis-inducing agent, while lactoferrin (LF) is an anabolic reagent which has the potential to inhibit chondrocyte apoptosis. We assessed the effects of LF on cartilage degeneration in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes and in a rat model of OA, and explored the potential molecular mechanisms involve.
icular chondrocytes (HACs) were treated with IL-1β alone or in combination with LF. MTT and flow cytometric assays were used to detect changes after treatment with LF. Western blotting was used to examine the relevant molecules regulating apoptosi.
that IL-1β reduced the viability of HACs, whereas 200 μg/mL of LF significantly counteracted the inhibitory effect of IL-1β. LF significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced HAC apoptosis. The protein expression of the apoptotic markers Caspase-3 and PARP was also significantly reduced in the LF treatment group when analyzed by western blotting. Furthermore, we found that LF triggered CREB1 phosphorylation in IL-1β-induced HAC apoptosis through AKT1 signaling. In addition, LF promoted the repair of articular cartilage damage in a rat OA model with elevated p-CREB level.
dies suggest that LF has an anti-apoptotic effect on IL-1β-induced chondrocytes, and thus may be a promising novel therapeutic agent for OA. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Base.
nisms that control the selection of transcription initiation and termination sites in response to pharmacological stimulation of neuronal cells are poorly understood. We used next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to construct a genome-wide inventory of protein-coding and non-coding transcripts altered by antidepressant treatment. We analyzed available ChIP-seq data to identify mechanisms that control drug-inducible expression of alternative gene variants in the brain. We identified 153 transcripts of various biotypes regulated in the mouse striatum in response to tranylcypromine or mianserin (at a 0.1% FDR threshold). Five drug-responsive gene patterns are enriched in protein-coding variants (77%), regulated by different sets of transcriptional factors (including SRF/CREB1 and GR/CTCF) and expressed in separate cellular compartments of the brain. We found that alterations mediated by proximal promoters in neurons are more specific in the selection of regulated transcriptional isoforms compared with enhancer-dependent alterations in glia. The change in transcriptional programs, from housekeeping to inducible, provides cells with the resource of functionally distinct proteins. We conclude that the regulation of drug-induced brain plasticity may occur at the level of transcripts rather than genes. The expression of specific isoforms in response to antidepressants may constitute a trigger that initiates the long-lasting effects of these drug.
is a poor-prognosis cancer in both humans and dogs. We have elucidated the antitumor mechanisms of antioncogenic microRNA (miR)-203 which is downregulated in human melanoma, as well as in canine melanoma. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of this downregulation. We focused on epigenetic aberration of miR-203 transcription. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (5-aza) markedly upregulated the expression level of miR-203 in almost all of the cell lines tested. Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing or methylation-specific PCR showed DNA methylation of CpG islands upstream of the miR-203 coding region (MIR203) in both human and canine melanoma cells, as well as in canine clinical specimens, but not in human normal melanocytes. The results of a luciferase activity assay showed obvious suppression of the transcription of miR-203 by DNA methylation. The use of the luciferase activity assay for CREB1 and an inhibition assay of miR-203 function performed with an miR-203 inhibitor confirmed the contribution of miR-203 upregulation toward the negative regulation of the target gene of miR-203. These results indicate that canine melanoma might be a preclinical model of human melanoma for epigenetic studies. In addition, this study suggests that agents that can demethylate MIR203 could be a common promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human and canine melanoma.
ariation can alter transcriptional regulatory activity contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of disease, but identifying individual variants that affect regulatory activity has been challenging. Quantitative sequence-based experiments such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq can detect sites of allelic imbalance where alleles contribute disproportionately to the overall signal suggesting allelic differences in regulatory activit.
d an allelic imbalance detection pipeline, AA-ALIGNER, to remove reference mapping biases influencing allelic imbalance detection and evaluate accuracy of allelic imbalance predictions in the absence of complete genotype data. Using the sequence aligner, GSNAP, and varying amounts of genotype information to remove mapping biases we investigated the accuracy of allelic imbalance detection (binomial test) in CREB1 ChIP-seq reads from the GM12878 cell line. Additionally we thoroughly evaluated the influence of experimental and analytical parameters on imbalance detectio.
to imbalances identified using complete genotypes, using imputed partial sample genotypes, AA-ALIGNER detected &gt;95 % of imbalances with &gt;90 % accuracy. AA-ALIGNER performed nearly as well using common variants when genotypes were unknown. In contrast, predicting additional heterozygous sites and imbalances using the sequence data led to &gt;50 % false positive rates. We evaluated effects of experimental data characteristics and key analytical parameter settings on imbalance detection. Overall, total base coverage and signal dispersion across the genome most affected our ability to detect imbalances, while parameters such as imbalance significance, imputation quality thresholds, and alignment mismatches had little effect. To assess the biological relevance of imbalance predictions, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to functionally test for predicted allelic differences in CREB1 binding in the GM12878 lymphoblast cell line. Six of nine tested variants exhibited allelic differences in binding. Two of these variants, rs2382818 and rs713875, are located within inflammatory bowel disease-associated loc.
R accurately detects allelic imbalance in quantitative sequence data using partial genotypes or common variants filling a critical methodological gap in these analyses, as full genotypes are rarely available. Importantly, we demonstrate how experimental and analytical features impact imbalance detection providing guidance for similar future studie.
e proper spatiotemporal control of gene expression, transcription factors cooperatively assemble onto specific DNA sequences. The ETS domain protein monomer of GABPα and the B-ZIP domain protein dimer of CREB1 cooperatively bind DNA only when the ETS ((C)/GCGGAA GT: ) and CRE ( GT: GACGTCAC) motifs overlap precisely, producing the ETS↔CRE motif ((C)/GCGGAA GT: GACGTCAC). We designed a Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) with 60-bp DNAs containing four identical sectors, each with 177,440 features that explore the cooperative interactions between GABPα and CREB1 upon binding the ETS↔CRE motif. The DNA sequences include all 15-mers of the form (C)/GCGGA--CG-, the ETS↔CRE motif, and all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and occurrences in the human and mouse genomes. CREB1 enhanced GABPα binding to the canonical ETS↔CRE motif CCGGAAGT two-fold, and up to 23-fold for several SNPs at the beginning and end of the ETS motif, which is suggestive of two separate and distinct allosteric mechanisms of cooperative binding. We show that the ETS-CRE array data can be used to identify regions likely cooperatively bound by GABPα and CREB1 in vivo, and demonstrate their ability to identify human genetic variants that might inhibit cooperative bindin.
division cycle associated 8 (CDCA8) gene plays an important role in mitosis. Overexpression of CDCA8 was reported in some human cancers and is required for cancer growth and progression. We found CDCA8 expression was also high in human ES cells (hESCs) but dropped significantly upon hESC differentiation. However, the regulation of CDCA8 expression has not yet been studied. Here, we characterized the CDCA8 promoter and identified its cis-elements and transcription factors. Three transcription start sites were identified. Reporter gene assays revealed that the CDCA8 promoter was activated in hESCs and cancer cell lines. The promoter drove the reporter expression specifically to pluripotent cells during early mouse embryo development and to tumor tissues in tumor-bearing mice. These results indicate that CDCA8 is transcriptionally activated in hESCs and cancer cells. Mechanistically, two key activation elements, bound by transcription factor NF-Y and CREB1, respectively, were identified in the CDCA8 basic promoter by mutation analyses and electrophoretic motility shift assays. NF-Y binding is positively correlated with promoter activities in different cell types. Interestingly, the NF-YA subunit, binding to the promoter, is primarily a short isoform in hESCs and a long isoform in cancer cells, indicating a different activation mechanism of the CDCA8 transcription between hESCs and cancer cells. Finally, enhanced CDCA8 promoter activities by NF-Y overexpression and reduced CDCA8 transcription by NF-Y knockdown further verified that NF-Y is a positive regulator of CDCA8 transcription. Our study unearths the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of CDCA8 expression in hESCs and cancer cells, which provides a better understanding of its biological function.
be a 7-year-old girl with angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) presenting severe inflammatory symptoms. The cytokine/chemokine profile of serum samples before and after surgery demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-6 had decreased by the greatest percentage. The AFH cells were immunopathologically positive for IL-6 and Tyr705-phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. The EWSR1-CREB1 fusion gene detected in the tumor leads to continuous activation of CREB1 and IL-6 production, because the promoter region of IL-6 has a CREB binding site. Thus, IL-6 plays pivotal roles in both paraneoplastic syndrome and the oncogenesis of AF.
ntly a new designation of &quot;Malignant Neuroectodermal Gastrointestinal Tumor&quot; has been proposed for an aggressive form of neuroectodermal tumor with features similar to that of Clear Cell Sarcoma of Soft Tissue, however without a melanocytic differentiation. Also known as &quot;clear cell sarcoma-like tumors of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, these tumors show some features strongly suggesting an origin from a gastrointestinal neuroectodermal precursor cell unable to differentiate along the melanocytic lineage. They occur mainly in young and middle-aged adults, and have a poor prognosis with a high rate of liver and lymphnode metastases. Histologically they are composed of epithelioid or oval-to spindle cells with a sheet-like or nested pattern of growth, strongly positive for neural markers (S-100, SOX10, and vimentin) and negative for the melanocytic ones. EWSR1 gene rearrangements including EWSR1-ATF1 or EWSR1-CREB1 GENE fusions are typically assessed in these tumors. Here we report a case of malignant neuroectodermal gastrointestinal tumor which immunophenotypically unusually expressed FLI-1, occurring in a 29-year-old man with a previous medical history of Ewing sarcoma. We finally suggest that this case might be a further evidence of a link between these two entitie.
ressive disorder is a common chronic emotional disorder, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein 1 (CREB1) is hypothesized to play a role in its pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between major depressive disorder and relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CREB1 gene. A total of 1,038 subjects of Han Chinese descent were recruited, including 456 patients with major depressive disorder (case group) and 582 healthy volunteers (control group). The frequency distributions of the genotypes and alleles were estimated in the case and control groups, and analyzed for any correlation with major depressive disorder. Three relevant SNP sites in CREB1 were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and statistical analyses were performed to estimate their use as risk factors for major depressive disorder. The analyses revealed that rs2254137 and rs16839883 in CREB1 showed polymorphisms in the sample population, and the genotype and allele frequencies of rs16839883 differed significantly when comparing the patients and healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected in the two SNP sites between the male and female patients (P&gt;0.05). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were detected in rs2254137 genotype and allele distribution when comparing the male and female patients with their corresponding control groups (P&gt;0.05). However, statistically significant differences were observed in the genotype and allele frequencies of rs16839883 when the male and female patients were compared with their respective controls (P&lt;0.05). Therefore, the results demonstrated that there is a close correlation between the rs16839883 polymorphism in CREB1 and major depressive disorder, which suggests that this SNP site should be further studied as a potential biomarker for major depressive disorde.
-D28k (CB), one of the major calcium-binding and buffering proteins, has a critical role in preventing a neuronal death as well as maintaining calcium homeostasis. Although marked reductions of CB expression have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unknown whether these changes contribute to AD-related dysfunction. To determine the pathogenic importance of CB depletions in AD models, we crossed 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD; Tg) mice with CB knock-out (CBKO) mice and generated a novel line CBKO·5XFAD (CBKOTg) mice. We first identified the change of signaling pathways and differentially expressed proteins globally by removing CB in Tg mice using mass spectrometry and antibody microarray. Immunohistochemistry showed that CBKOTg mice had significant neuronal loss in the subiculum area without changing the magnitude (number) of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) plaques deposition and elicited significant apoptotic features and mitochondrial dysfunction compared with Tg mice. Moreover, CBKOTg mice reduced levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser-133 and synaptic molecules such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDA receptor 1), NMDA receptor 2A, PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum compared with Tg mice. Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that removal of CB from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, suggesting that CB has a critical role in AD pathogenesi.
d Ginseng (KRG) is one of the representative traditional herbal medicines prepared from Panax ginseng Meyer (Araliaceae) in Korea. It has been reported that KRG exhibits a lot of different biological actions such as anti-aging, anti-fatigue, anti-stress, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. Although systematic studies have investigated how KRG is able to ameliorate various inflammatory diseases, its molecular inhibitory mechanisms had not been carried out prior to this stud.
to investigate these mechanisms, we evaluated the effects of a water extract of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG-WE) on the in vitro inflammatory responses of activated RAW264.7 cells, and on in vivo gastritis and peritonitis models by analyzing the activation events of inflammation-inducing transcription factors and their upstream kinase.
duced the production of nitric oxide (NO), protected cells against NO-induced apoptosis, suppressed mRNA levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and interferon (IFN)-β, ameliorated EtOH/HCl-induced gastritis, and downregulated peritoneal exudate-derived NO production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice. The inhibition of these inflammatory responses by KRG-WE was regulated through the suppression of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and by subsequent inhibition of activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and IRF-3 activation. Of ginsensides included in this extract, interestingly, G-Rc showed the highest inhibitory potency on IRF-3-mediated luciferase activit.
ults strongly suggest that the anti-inflammatory activities of KRG-WE could be due to its inhibition of the p38/JNK/TBK1 activation pathwa.
vasopressin (AVP) is a neurohypophysial hormone regulating hydromineral homeostasis. Here we show that the mRNA encoding cAMP responsive element-binding protein-3 like-1 (CREB3L1), a transcription factor of the CREB/activating transcription factor (ATF) family, increases in expression in parallel with AVP expression in supraoptic nuclei (SONs) and paraventicular nuclei (PVNs) of dehydrated (DH) and salt-loaded (SL) rats, compared with euhydrated (EH) controls. In EH animals, CREB3L1 protein is expressed in glial cells, but only at a low level in SON and PVN neurons, whereas robust upregulation in AVP neurons accompanied DH and SL rats. Concomitantly, CREB3L1 is activated by cleavage, with the N-terminal domain translocating from the Golgi, via the cytosol, to the nucleus. We also show that CREB3L1 mRNA levels correlate with AVP transcription level in SONs and PVNs following sodium depletion, and as a consequence of diurnal rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. We tested the hypothesis that CREB3L1 activates AVP gene transcription. Both full-length and constitutively active forms of CREB3L1 (CREB3L1CA) induce the expression of rat AVP promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, whereas a dominant-negative mutant reduces expression. Rat AVP promoter deletion constructs revealed that CRE-like and G-box sequences in the region between -170 and -120 bp are important for CREB3L1 actions. Direct binding of CREB3L1 to the AVP promoter was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation both in vitro and in the SON itself. Injection of a lentiviral vector expressing CREB3L1CA into rat SONs and PVNs resulted in increased AVP biosynthesis. We thus identify CREB3L1 as a regulator of AVP transcription in the rat hypothalamu.
ecent reports have demonstrated that photoreceptors are expressed in human skin. The rod and cone photoreceptor-like proteins are expressed in human skin and rhodopsin, long wavelength-opsin, and short wavelength-opsin are also present in cultured murine melanocytes. Furthermore, the photopigment rhodopsin is expressed in human melanocytes and is involved in ultraviolet A phototransduction which induces early melanin synthesis. In this study, we investigated whether rhodopsin is expressed and plays any physiological roles in the normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). We found that rhodopsin was expressed and localized on the plasma membrane in NHEKs, and only violet light among several wavelengths within the visible range significantly increased the expression of rhodopsin mRNA. We further found that rhodopsin over-expression decreased the mRNA expression levels of keratinocyte differentiation markers, such as keratin-1 and keratin-10, and violet light also decreased the mRNA expression levels of keratinocyte differentiation markers and these decreased expression levels were recovered by a rhodopsin-directed siRNA. Moreover, we further demonstrated that violet light significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and that it more effectively decreased the phosphorylation of CREB when rhodopsin was over-expressed. In addition, we observed that pertussis toxin, a Gαi protein inhibitor, restored the rhodopsin-induced decrease in the differentiation markers in NHEKs. Taken together, these results suggest that rhodopsin down-regulates the expression levels of specific keratinocyte differentiation markers via the Gαi signaling pathway in NHEK.
 (TX), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, exerts antagonistic effects on breast tissue and is used to treat breast cancer. Recent evidence also suggests that it may act as an agonist in brain tissue. We reported previously that TX enhanced the expression and function of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) in rat astrocytes, an effect that was mediated by TGF-α. To gain further insight into the mechanisms that mediate TX-induced up-regulation of GLT-1 (EAAT2 in humans), we investigated its effect on GLT-1 at the transcriptional level. TX phosphorylated the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and recruited CREB to the GLT-1 promoter consensus site. The effect of TX on astrocytic GLT-1 was attenuated by the inhibition of PKA, the upstream activator of the CREB pathway. In addition, the effect of TX on GLT-1 promoter activity was abolished by the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, TX recruited the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 to the NF-κB binding domain of the GLT-1 promoter. Mutation of NF-κB (triple, -583/-282/-251) or CRE (-308) sites on the GLT-1 promoter led to significant repression of the promoter activity, but neither mutant completely abolished the TX-induced GLT-1 promoter activity. Mutation of both the NF-κB (-583/-282/-251) and CRE (-308) sites led to a complete abrogation of the effect of TX on GLT-1 promoter activity. Taken together, our findings establish that TX regulates GLT-1 via the CREB and NF-κB pathway.
eceptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-activated transcription factors regulating lipid metabolism and inflammation. In the skin, activation of LXRs stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes and augments lipid synthesis in sebocytes. However, the function of LXRs in melanocytes remains largely unknown. We investigated whether LXR activation would affect melanogenesis. In human primary melanocytes, MNT-1, and B16 melanoma cells, TO901317, a synthetic LXR ligand, inhibited melanogenesis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments revealed the dominant role of LXRβ in TO901317-mediated antimelanogenesis. Enzymatic activities of tyrosinase were unaffected, but the expression of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), and TRP-2 was suppressed by TO901317. Expressions of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), a master transcriptional regulator of melanogenesis, and cAMP-responsive element-binding activation were not affected. It is noteworthy that the degradation of MITF was accelerated by TO901317. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) contributed to TO901317-induced antimelanogenesis, which was evidenced by recovery of melanogenesis with ERK inhibitor. Other LXR ligands, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)HC) and GW3965, also activated ERK and suppressed melanogenesis. The intermediary role of Ras was confirmed in TO901317-induced ERK phosphorylation. Finally, antimelanogenic effects of TO901317 were confirmed in vivo in UVB-tanning model in brown guinea pigs, providing a previously unreported line of evidence that LXRs may be important targets for antimelanogenesi.
tein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 contributes to the neuroprotective effects of 17β-estradiol (E2); however, the mechanisms associated with this protection have yet to be elucidated. Given that E2 increases astrocytic expression of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), which would prevent excitotoxic-induced neuronal death, we proposed that GPR30 mediates E2 action on GLT-1 expression. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the effects of G1, a selective agonist of GPR30, and GPR30 siRNA on astrocytic GLT-1 expression, as well as glutamate uptake in rat primary astrocytes, and explored potential signaling pathways linking GPR30 to GLT-1. G1 increased GLT-1 protein and mRNA levels, subject to regulation by both MAPK and PI3K signaling. Inhibition of TGF-α receptor suppressed the G1-induced increase in GLT-1 expression. Silencing GPR30 reduced the expression of both GLT-1 and TGF-α and abrogated the G1-induced increase in GLT-1 expression. Moreover, the G1-induced increase in GLT-1 protein expression was abolished by a protein kinase A inhibitor and an NF-κB inhibitor. G1 also enhanced cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), as well as both NF-κB p50 and NF-κB p65 binding to the GLT-1 promoter. Finally, to model dysfunction of glutamate transporters, manganese was used, and G1 was found to attenuate manganese-induced impairment in GLT-1 protein expression and glutamate uptake. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that activation of GPR30 increases GLT-1 expression via multiple pathways, suggesting that GPR30 is worthwhile as a potential target to be explored for developing therapeutics of excitotoxic neuronal injur.
n has been a traditional medicine in China and Korea for centuries. This study explored the inhibitory effect of cordycepin on melanogenesis and the relative molecular mechanisms. Cordycepin inhibited melanin synthesis-related enzymes, such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP1) and tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP2). α-MSH and IBMX were reported as melanin synthesis enhancers. Both of them could increase intracellular melanin synthesis by activation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) signaling pathway. In the MITF pathway, the phosphorylation of cAMP related binding protein (CREB) activated the transcription of MITF, resulting in increasing melanin synthesis. Cordycepin also decreased the phosphorylation of CREB induced by α-MSH and IBMX in B16F10 melanoma cells. Accordingly, cordycepin inhibited melanogenesis signaling pathways by activating ERK and AKT signaling pathways to regulate the suppression of MITF and its downstream pathways including tyrosinase, TRP1 and TRP2. These results indicate the role of cordycepin as a potent depigmenting agent for cosmetic.
almia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is inducible in response to cAMP through the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and plays a pivotal role in the melanocyte-specific expression of tyrosinase or tyrosinase-related proteins (TRPs) for melanin biosynthesis. Manassantin A from Saururus chinensis inhibits cAMP-induced melanin production in B16 melanoma cells. Here, we focused on molecular basis of the antimelanogenic activity. Manassantin A consistently inhibited the cAMP elevator 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)- or dibutyryl cAMP-induced melanin production in B16 cells or in melan-a melanocytes by down-regulating the expression of tyrosinase or TRP1 gene. Moreover, manassantin A suppressed MITF induction through IBMX-activated CREB pathway, directly inhibiting the Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB. However, manassantin A did not affect IBMX-increased cAMP levels in these cells but also other cAMP-dependent melanogenic pathways through post-translational modifications of MITF. This putative molecular mechanism of manassantin A in the inhibition of melanin production suggests its pharmacological potential in skin hyperpigmentatio.
onse-element-binding protein (CREB) signaling has been reported to be associated with cancer development and poor clinical outcome in various types of cancer. However, it remains to be elucidated whether CREB is involved in breast cancer development and osteotropism. Here, we found that metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exhibited higher CREB expression than did non-metastatic MCF-7 cells and that CREB expression was further increased by several soluble factors linked to cancer progression, such as IL-1, IGF-1, and TGF-beta. Using wild-type CREB and a dominant-negative form (K-CREB), we found that CREB signaling positively regulated the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, K-CREB prevented MDA-MB-231 cell-induced osteolytic lesions in a mouse model of cancer metastasis. Furthermore, CREB signaling in cancer cells regulated the gene expression of PTHrP, MMPs, and OPG, which are closely involved in cancer metastasis and bone destruction. These results indicate that breast cancer cells acquire CREB overexpression during their development and that this CREB upregulation plays an important role in multiple steps of breast cancer bone metastasi.
is an inflammatory-related cytokine that has inhibitory effects on gonadotropin- and cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis. Because ovulation is an inflammatory reaction and TNF specifically induces serum amyloid A3 (SAA3) in mouse granulosa cells, the effect of cAMP on TNF-induced SAA3 promoter activity, mRNA and protein was investigated. Granulosa cells from immature mice were cultured with TNF and/or cAMP. TNF increased SAA3 promoter activity, mRNA, and protein, which were further increased by cAMP. cAMP alone increased SAA3 promoter activity, but SAA3 mRNA and protein remained undetectable. Thus, there appeared to be different mechanisms by which TNF and cAMP regulated SAA3 expression. SAA3 promoters lacking a nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-like site or containing its mutant were not responsive to TNF but were responsive to cAMP. Among four CCAAT-enhancing binding protein (C/EBP) sites in the SAA3 promoter, the C/EBP site nearest the NF-kappaB-like site was required for TNF-induced SAA3. The C/EBP site at -75/-67 was necessary for responsiveness to cAMP. Dominant-negative C/EBP and cAMP response element-binding protein or short interfering RNA of C/EBPbeta blocked TNF- or cAMP-induced SAA3 promoter activity. The combination of TNF and cAMP increased C/EBPbeta protein above that induced by TNF or cAMP alone. Thus, cAMP in combination with TNF specifically induced C/EBPbeta protein, leading to enhanced SAA3 expression but requiring NF-kappaB in mouse granulose cells. In addition, like TNF, SAA inhibited cAMP-induced estradiol accumulation and CYP19 levels. These data indicate SAA may play a role in events occurring during the ovulation proces.
ide Y (NPY) and NPY receptors are widely expressed in various organs and cell types and have been shown to have pleiotropic functions. However, their presence or role in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remains unknown. We now show that undifferentiated hESCs primarily express NPY and its Y1 and Y5 receptors. Inhibition of NPY signalling using either the selective NPY Y1 or Y5 receptor antagonist reduces the maintenance of self-renewal and proliferation of undifferentiated hESCs. We also provide compelling evidence that exogenous NPY supports the long-term growth of undifferentiated hESCs in the absence of feeder cell factors using only knockout serum replacement media. Further, NPY facilitates the use of chemically defined medium made up of N2/B27 supplement and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) for hESC feeder-free culture. Our results indicate that both Y1 and Y5 receptors appear to be involved in the NPY-mediated activation of AKT/protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in hESCs. Notably, only Y1 receptor, but not Y5 receptor, is responsible for the NPY-induced activation of cAMP-response element binding (CREB) in hESCs. These results provide the first evidence that NPY and its Y1 and Y5 receptors have potential role in maintaining hESC self-renewal and pluripotency. We demonstrate the underlying importance of NPY signalling and its usefulness in the development of a defined and xeno-free culture condition for the large-scale propagation of undifferentiated hESC.
onfirmed that the NO donor (+/-)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) stabilizes the transactive form of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), leading to the induction of HIF-1alpha target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor and carbonic anhydrase 9. Activation of HIF-1alpha should require inhibition of the dual system that keeps it inactive. One is ubiquitination, which is triggered by hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha-proline and the subsequent binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase, the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein. The other is hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha-asparagine, which reduces the affinity of HIF-1alpha for its coactivator, cAMP responsive element binding protein/p300. We examined the effects of the NO donor SNAP on proline and asparagine hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha peptides by measuring the activities of the corresponding enzymes, HIF-1alpha-specific proline hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) and the HIF-1alpha-specific asparagine hydroxylase, designated factor inhibiting HIF-1alpha (FIH-1), respectively. We found that the SNAP did not prevent PHD2 from hydroxylating the proline of HIF-1alpha. Instead, it blocked the interaction between VHL and the proline-hydroxylated HIF-1alpha, but only when the reducing agents Fe(II) and vitamin C were limiting. The fact that the absence of cysteine 520 of HIF-1alpha abolishes its responsiveness to SNAP suggests that this residue mediates the inhibition by SNAP of the interaction between VHL and HIF-1alpha, presumably by S-nitrosylation of HIF-1alpha. Un-like PHD2, asparagine hydroxylation by FIH-1 was directly inhibited by SNAP, but again only when reducing agents were limiting. Substitution of cysteine 800 of HIF-1alpha with alanine failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of SNAP on asparagine hydroxylation, implying that FIH-1, not its substrate HIF-1alpha, is inhibited by SNA.
scular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene in approximately 96% of cases. Four percent of SMA patients have a combination of the deletion or conversion on one allele and an intragenic mutation on the second one. We performed analysis of point mutations in a set of our patients with suspicion of SMA and without homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. A quantitative test determining SMN1 copy number (using real-time PCR and/or MLPA analysis) was performed in 301 patients and only 1 SMN1 copy was detected in 14 of them. When these 14 patients were screened for the presence of point mutations we identified 6 mutations, p.Y272C (in three patients) and p.T274I, p.I33IfsX6, and p.A188S (each in one case). The mutations p.I33IfsX6 and p.A188S were found in two SMAI patients and were not detected previously. Further, evaluation of the relationship between mutation type, copy number of the SMN2 gene and clinical findings was performed. Among our SMA patients with a SMN1 homozygous deletion, we found a family with two patients: the son with SMAII possesses 3 SMN2 copies and the nearly asymptomatic father has a homozygous deletion of SMN1 exon 7 and carries 4 SMN2 copies. Generally, our results illustrate that an increased SMN2 gene copy number is associated with a milder SMA phenotyp.
optic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) undergo a dramatic function-related plasticity during dehydration. We hypothesize that alterations in steady-state transcript levels might be partially responsible for this remodeling. In turn, regulation of transcript abundance might be mediated by transcription factors. We used microarrays to identify changes in the expression of mRNAs encoding transcription factors in response to water deprivation in the SON. We observed downregulation of 10 and upregulation of 28 transcription factor transcripts. For five of the upregulated mRNAs, namely gonadotropin inducible ovarian transcription factor 1 (Giot1), Giot2, cAMP-responsive element binding protein 3-like 1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, and activating transcription factor 4, in situ hybridization was used to confirm the array results, demonstrating a significant increase in expression in SON and PVN magnocellular neurons (MCNs) after 3 d of water deprivation and, in some cases, upregulation in parvocellular PVN neurons. Using a viral vector expressing a potent inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), we show that the osmotically induced increase in the abundance of transcripts encoding Giot1 is mediated in vivo by the PKA pathway. We thus suggest that signaling pathways activated by dehydration in MCNs mediate transcription factor gene activation, which, in turn, regulate target genes that mediate HNS remodelin.
scular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder caused by mutations of the SMN1 gene. Because of the autosomal recessive type of transmission, the genetic risk of the disease in the following generations is small and is estimated to be about 1%. Here we present a case report of a father and son suffering from SMA. The father is affected with a mild form of SMA, with onset at about 13 years of age. The son suffers from SMA type 2, with onset at about 13 months of age. In both father and son, genetic analysis showed biallelic deletion of exons 7 and 8 in the SMN1 gene. The boy's mother is a carrier of the deletion at the SMA locus. Quantitative analysis revealed one copy of the SMN1 gen.
se of the present paper was to determine whether the brief exposure of neurons to antipsychotic drugs is associated with the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) response element (CRE) binding protein (CREB). The activation of ERK-1/2 and CREB can be monitored by immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognize p-ERK-1/2 (phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204) and p-CREB (phosphorylated on Ser-133). In hippocampal neuron cultures at 25 days in vitro (DIV), the levels of ERK and CREB phosphorylation significantly increased after treatment with haloperidol (50 nmol/L) and risperidone (50 nmol/L), except when risperidone was administered at the p-CREB level. However, risperidone also increased the p-CREB level at an insignificant rate in the same direction. At 10 DIV, none of the antipsychotic drugs significantly increased the level of ERK and CREB phosphorylation. The difference between levels of ERK and CREB phosphorylation in response to haloperidol and risperidone at 25 DIV was also observed. Risperidone significantly increased the level of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, but not the level of CREB phosphorylation. Haloperidol, in contrast, had a different effect. These data indicate that neuronal maturation affects the phosphorylation of ERK and CREB in response to antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that different antipsychotic drugs could lead to different profiles of ERK and CREB phosphorylation in neuron.
as been demonstrated to increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of rodent hippocampus. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of lithium on the proliferation and differentiation of rat neural progenitor cells in hippocampus both in vitro and in vivo. Lithium chloride (1-3 mM) produced a significant increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in high-density cultures, but did not increase clonal size in low-density cultures. Lithium chloride at 1 mM (within the therapeutic range) also increased the number of cells double-labeled with BrdU antibody and TuJ1 (a class III beta-tubulin antibody) in high-density cultures and the number of TuJ1-positive cells in a clone of low-density cultures, whereas it decreased the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in both cultures. These results suggest that lithium selectively increased differentiation of neuronal progenitors. These actions of lithium appeared to enhance a neuronal subtype, calbindin(D28k)-positive cells, and involved a phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that lithium in therapeutic amounts may elicit its beneficial effects via facilitation of neural progenitor differentiation toward a calbindin(D28k)-positive neuronal cell typ.
en proposed that endothelial integrity can play an active regulatory role in the extravasation of tumor cells during cancer metastasis. Since polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been shown to cause endothelial cell activation or injury and to lead to various diseases that involve dysfunction of the vascular endothelium, the present study was designed to determine the cellular and molecular signaling mechanisms of PCB-induced apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). A significant and marked decrease in cell viability was observed in HMEC-1 treated with 2,2',4,6,6'-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 104) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Exposure of HMEC-1 to PCB 104 also dramatically induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. However, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk significantly reversed the PCB 104-induced DNA fragmentation in HMEC-1, suggesting that endothelial cell death induced by PCB 104 exposure is, at least in part, due to caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. To elucidate the molecular signaling mechanisms of PCB 104-induced apoptotic cell death in human microvascular endothelial cells, the present study focused on the effects of acute exposure of PCB 104 on the activation of several transcription factors, such as cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1), which have been known to play a pivotal role in the molecular signaling cascades for the induction of apoptosis. A series of electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PCB 104 specifically increased only CREB DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. AP-1, NF-kappaB, and STAT1, however, were not activated. In addition, zVAD-fmk significantly and dose-dependently blocked the CREB activation enhanced by PCB 104 exposure. These results suggest that PCB-induced death of human microvascular endothelial cells is mediated, at least in part, via the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways and that the selective activation of CREB is involved in this proces.
oxidative stress and alterations in redox status can be implicated in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity. To elucidate the molecular signaling pathways of METH-induced neurotoxicity, we investigated the effects of a single intraperitoneal injection of METH (1.0, 10, or 20 mg/kg) on DNA-binding activity of specific redox-sensitive transcription factors in mouse brain. Transcription factors studied included activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), SP-1, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3). Significant and dose-dependent inductions of AP-1 and CREB DNA-binding activities were observed in four different regions (striatum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) isolated from the brains of mice injected with METH. However, injections with METH did not affect DNA binding activities of NF-kappaB, SP-1, STAT1, and STAT3. These results suggest that METH-induced oxidative stress may trigger the molecular signaling pathways via specific and selective activation of AP-1 and CRE.
eacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) that modulate gene expression by inhibiting HDAC enzymes may contribute to the survival of immature hippocampal neurons. However, it remains unknown how and when HDACIs regulate the survival of newly generated immature hippocampal neurons. In the present study, if the treatment of valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (SBt) in the specific time window during the development of newly generated n eurons r esulted in the i ncreased survival of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)(+) neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus in mice was investigated. It was found that the number of BrdU(+) cells, the expressions of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and pCREB [D1] were increased by HDACIs when HDACIs were treated no later than 2-3 weeks after BrdU labeling. This suggests that epigenetic modification within a specific time window is critical for the survival of newborn hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the apoptotic pathwa.
radiation for the treatment of cancer can affect normal cells, such as the rapidly proliferating spermatogenic cells of the testis, leading to infertility, a common post-irradiation problem. The present study investigated the radioprotective effect of rolipram, a specific phosphodiesterase type-IV inhibitor known to increase the expression and phosphorylation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), a key factor for spermatogenesis, with the testicular system against pelvic irradiatio.
L/6 mice were treated with pelvic irradiation (2 Gy) and rolipram, alone or in combination, and were sacrificed at 12 hours and 35 days after irradiatio.
protected germ cells from radiation-induced apoptosis at 12 hours after irradiation and significantly increased testis weight compared with irradiation controls at 35 days. Rolipram also ameliorated radiation-induced testicular morphological changes, such as changes in seminiferous tubular diameter and epithelial height. Additionally, seminiferous tubule repopulation and stem cell survival indices were higher in the rolipram-treated group than in the radiation group. Moreover, rolipram treatment counteracted the radiation-mediated decrease in the sperm count and mobility in the epididymi.
tective effects of rolipram treatment prior to irradiation may be mediated by the increase in pCREB levels at 12 hours post-irradiation and the attenuated decrease in pCREB levels in the testis at 35 days post-irradiation in the rolipram-treated group. These findings suggest that activation of CREB signaling by rolipram treatment ameliorates the detrimental effects of acute irradiation on testicular dysfunction and the related male reproductive functions in mic.
vasopressin (AVP) is synthesised in magnocellular neurons (MCNs) of supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. In response to the hyperosmotic stressors of dehydration (complete fluid deprivation, DH) or salt loading (drinking 2% salt solution, SL), AVP synthesis increases in MCNs, which over-burdens the protein folding machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are signaling pathways that improve ER function in response to the accumulation of misfold/unfold protein. We asked whether an ER stress response was activated in the SON and PVN of DH and SL rats. We observed increased mRNA expression for the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4), C/EBP-homologous protein (Chop), and cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 1 (Creb3l1) in both SON and PVN of DH and SL rats. Although we found no changes in the splicing pattern of X box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1), an increase in the level of the unspliced form of Xbp1 (Xbp1U) was observed in DH and SL rats. CREB3L1, a novel ER stress inducer, has been shown to be activated by ER stress to regulate the expression of target genes. We have previously shown that CREB3L1 is a transcriptional regulator of the AVP gene; however, a role for CREB3L1 in the response to ER stress has yet to be investigated in MCNs. Here, we used lentiviral vectors to introduce a dominant negative form of CREB3L1 (CREB3L1DN) in the rat SON. Expression of CREB3L1DN in the SON decreased Chop and Xbp1U mRNA levels, but not BiP and Atf4 transcript expression. CREB3L1 is thus implicated as a transcriptional mediator of the ER stress response in the osmotically stimulated SO.
 adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a potent neuropeptide that possesses both neurotrophic and neurodevelopmental effects. Recently, the Rit GTPase was found to be activated by a novel Galpha/cAMP/exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP (Epac)-dependent signaling pathway and required for PACAP-dependent cAMP response element-binding protein activation and neuronal differentiation. However, Epac did not function as a Rit guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and the nature of the PACAP regulatory cascade remained unclear. Here, we show that PACAP-mediated Rit activation involves Src family kinase-dependent TrkA receptor transactivation. PACAP receptor (PACR1) stimulation triggered both G(i)alpha and G(s)alpha/cAMP/Epac regulatory cascades resulting in Src kinase activity, which in turn induced TrkA kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. Importantly, Src inhibition, or the lack of functional Trk receptors, was found to inhibit PACAP-mediated Rit activation, whereas constitutively active Src alone was sufficient to stimulate Rit-guanosine triphosphate levels. A single tyrosine (Y(499)) phosphorylation event was identified as critical to both PACAP-mediated transactivation and TrkA-dependent Rit activation. Accordingly, PACAP stimulation resulted in TrkA-dependent phosphorylation of both the Shc adaptor and son of sevenless (SOS)1/2 GEFs, and Rit activation was inhibited by RNA interference silencing of SOS1/2, implicating a TrkA/Shc/SOS signaling complex in Rit regulation. Together, these observations expand upon the nature of PACR1-mediated transactivation and identify TrkA-Rit signaling as a key contributor to PACAP-dependent neuronal differentiatio.
cascade and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are critical modulators of depression. Here we have tested whether the antidepressive effect of the cAMP cascade is mediated by VEGF in the adult hippocampus. We used a conditional genetic system in which the Aplysia octopamine receptor (Ap oa(1)), a G(s)-coupled receptor, is transgenically expressed in the forebrain neurons of mice. Chronic activation of the heterologous Ap oa(1) by its natural ligand evoked antidepressant-like behaviors, accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein and transcription of VEGF in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurons. Selective knockdown of VEGF in these cells during the period of cAMP elevation inhibited the antidepressant-like behaviors. These findings reveal a molecular interaction between the cAMP cascade and VEGF expression, and the pronounced behavioral consequences of this interaction shed light on the mechanism underlying neuronal VEGF functions in antidepressio.
A is a flavonoid compound that is found in the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of oroxylin A on memory impairment induced by transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) in mice. The ameliorating effect of oroxylin A on memory impairment was investigated using a passive avoidance task, the Y-maze task, and the Morris water maze task in mice. Oroxylin A was found to significantly reverse 2VO-induced cognitive impairments in the passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks in a dose dependant manner (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, oroxylin A (5 mg/kg, p.o.) shortened the escape-latency and prolonged swimming times in the target quadrant during the probe trial in the Morris water maze task (P&lt;0.05). Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies showed that the number of Nissl bodies and OX-42 positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus regions were attenuated by oroxylin A. Moreover, phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) positive cell numbers were markedly increased in animals treated with oroxylin A than in untreated 2VO controls. These results suggest that oroxylin A dramatically attenuates the memory impairment induced by 2VO, and that this effect may be mediated by the neuroprotective effects of oroxylin A as supported oroxylin A induced reductions in activated microglia and increases in BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylatio.
of follicular lesions of the thyroid is encapsulated similar to follicular adenomas but with partial nuclear features suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), raising the possibility of biologically borderline tumor.
ession profiling and advanced significance analyses were performed on 50 histologically unequivocal benign and malignant tumors, and a list of 61 differentially expressed genes was generated. By using this 61-gene list, unsupervised hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses were performed on 40 additional tumors, including 15 histologically borderline tumors, 11 benign tumors, and 14 PTC.
revealed 3 distinct tumor groups-benign, malignant, and intermediate. Tumors in the intermediate group (n = 15) were mostly histologic borderline tumors and had an expression profile overlapping with the benign and malignant groups. Twenty-seven genes were expressed differentially between the benign and intermediate groups, including the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/p300-interactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain 1 or CITED1 gene and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 or FGFR2 gene. Fourteen genes were expressed differentially between the intermediate group and malignant tumors, notably overexpression of the met proto-oncogene and of the high-mobility group adenine/thymine-hook 2 or HMGA2 gene in malignancies. Mutations of the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 or BRAF gene were identified in 4 of 14 malignant tumors but not in benign or intermediate tumors. Patients who had either histologically or molecularly borderline tumors did not have metastasis or recurrence.
ession profiling supported the finding that encapsulated thyroid follicular lesions with partial nuclear features of PTC are biologically borderline tumors that are distinct molecularly from benign and malignant tumors.</pr.
