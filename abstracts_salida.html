<body>((PMID:27089330))miRNAs have been widely investigated in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about their effects on bird growth. Here we characterized the promoter of miR-206 in chicken and found that the preferable promoter was located in 1200 bp upstream of pri-miR-206. In this region, many key transcription factors, including MyoD, c-Myb, CEBPα/β, AP-4, RAP1, Brn2, GATA-1/2/3, E47, Sn, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and CdxA, were predicted to bind and interact with miR-206 promoter. Overexpression of MyoD sharply increased miR-206 expression in both fibroblast and myoblast cells, and also the regulation in the myoblast cells was much stronger, indicating that miR-206 was regulated by MyoD combined with other muscle specific transcriptional factors. Aiming to further investigate the relationship between miR-206 mutation and transcriptional expression, total of 23 SNPs were identified in the two distinct bird lines by sequencing. Interestingly, the motif bound by MyoD was individually destroyed by G-to-C mutation located at 419 bp upstream of miR-206 precursor. Co-transfecting MyoD and miR-206 promoter in DF-1 cells, the luciferase activity of promoter containing homozygous GG types was significantly higher than CC ones (p < 0.05). Thus, this mutation caused low expression of miR-206. Consistently, eight variants including G-419C mutation exhibited a great effect on birthweight through maker-trait association analysis in F2 population (p < 0.05). Additionally, the regulation of miR-206 on embryo muscle mass mainly by increasing MyoG and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) expression (p < 0.05) with little change in MyoD, TMEM8C and myosin heavy chain (MHC). In conclusion, our findings provide a novel mutation destroying the promoter activity of miR-206 in birds and shed new light to understand the regulation mechanism of miR-206 on the embryonic muscle growth.((PMID:26226650))Phenoloxidases (POs) play key roles in various physiological functions in insects, e.g., cuticular sclerotization, wound healing, egg tanning, cuticle formation and melanotic encapsulaction of pathogens. Previously, we identified five POs, designated As-pro-PO I-V, from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus and demonstrated that the functions of As-pro-PO I, II and III, were associated with filarial parasite melanization, blood feeding and cuticle formation, respectively. In the present study, we delineate the dual functions of As-pro-PO V. We found that the level of As-pro-PO V mRNA in mosquitoes was significantly increased after microfilaria challenge or blood feeding, and decreased to normal level after oviposition. Knockdown of As-pro-PO V by dsRNA resulted in significant decreases in the degree of microfilaria melanization, egg chronic melanization rates and egg hatching rates in Ar. subalbatus. Further transfection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays verified the As-pro-PO V gene might regulated by both AP-1, a putative immune-related regulatory element and CdxA, a developmental regulatory element. The binding of AP-1 and CdxA motif with mosquito nuclear extracts was significantly enhanced after microfilaria challenge and blood-feeding in Ar. subalbatus, respectively. These results indicate that As-pro-PO V is a critical enzyme that is required for both an effective melanization immune response and egg chorion melanization in this mosquito.((PMID:25024040))Our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p = 0.0007, OR = 0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.74; rs2738081, p = 0.0003, OR = 0.72; rs2738058, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.73; rs4288398, p = 0.0008, OR = 0.78; rs6984215, p = 0.002, OR = 0.63; rs12716641, p = 0.00002, OR = 0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chinese.((PMID:24880497))This study examined the associations between vitamin D status, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and markers of calcium homeostasis in preschool-aged children. Children (n=488; age range: 1.8-6.0 y) were randomly recruited from Montreal. The distal forearm was scanned using a peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (Lunar PIXI; GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). A subset (n=81) had clinical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) scans (Hologic 4500A Discovery Series) of lumbar spine (LS) 1-4, whole body, and ultradistal forearm. All were assessed for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone concentrations (Liaison; Diasorin), ionized calcium (ABL80 FLEX; Radiometer Medical A/S), and dietary vitamin D and calcium intakes by survey. Age (p<0.001) and weight-for-age Z-score (p<0.001) were positively associated with BMC and aBMD in all regression models, whereas male sex contributed positively to forearm BMC and aBMD. Having a 25(OH)D concentration of >75 nmol/L positively associated with forearm and whole body BMC and aBMD (p<0.036). Sun index related to (p<0.029) cDXA forearm and LS 1-4 BMC and whole-body aBMD. Nutrient intakes did not relate to BMC or aBMD. In conclusion, higher vitamin D status is linked to higher BMC and aBMD of forearm and whole body in preschool-aged children.((PMID:24287273))Helicobacter pylori encoded CagA is presently the only known virulence factor that is injected into gastric epithelial cells where it destroys apical junctional complexes and induces dedifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells, leading to H. pylori-related gastric carcinogensis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which CagA mediates these changes. Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor highly expressed in multistage tissues of dysplasia and cancer. One specific target of Cdx2, Claudin-2, is involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In this study, our findings showed that the activity of Cdx2 binding to Cdx binding sites of CdxA (GTTTATG) and CdxB (TTTTAGG) of probes corresponding to claudin-2 flanking region increased in AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain. Moreover, Cdx2 upregulated claudin-2 expression at transcriptional level and translational level. In the meantime, we found that TJs of AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain, were more severely destroyed, leading to wider cell gap, interference of contact, scattering and highly elevated migration of cells. Herein, this study is firstly demonstrated that H. pylori-encoded CagA disrupts TJs and induces invasiveness of AGS gastric carcinoma cells via Cdx2-dependent targeting of Claudin-2. This provides a new mechanism whereby CagA induced dedifferentiation of AGS cells, leading to malignant behavior of biology.((PMID:23612636))There are few large-scale studies on the utility of peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) in children. As central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) equipment is not commonly available in the developing world, we assessed the correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) with cDXA and pDXA in children to determine the optimal Z-score thresholds of pDXA for predicting two predefined Z-score cutoffs (≤-1, ≤-2) of cDXA in 844 subjects (441 boys, 403 girls) aged 10-18 years. The BMD of antero-posterior lumbar spine (L1-L4), proximal femur and forearm was measured by cDXA, while the peripheral BMD of forearm and calcaneus was estimated using pDXA. The correlation was statistically significant at all sites (p<0.01). The coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.79 in boys and 0.17 to 0.32 in girls. A significant positive correlation was observed between BMD by pDXA and cDXA in Indian children, with a strong gender difference in both the extent of correlation and the ability of peripheral BMD to predict central BMD.((PMID:23534754))The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine-like molecule that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reactions and Western blot assays indicated that HMGB1 transcriptional activity and protein level are increased in Tax+-T cells (TaxP). To clarify the mechanisms, a series of HMGB1 deletion reporter plasmids (pHLuc1 to pHLuc6) were transfected into Tax--T cells (TaxN, Jurkat) and Tax+-T cells (TaxP). We found that promoter activity in Tax+-T cells to be higher than that in Tax--T cells, indicating a significant increase in pHLuc6. Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) treatment did not block the enhancing effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Tax was retained on a HMGB1 promoter fragment encompassing -1163 to -975. Bioinformatics analysis showed six characteristic cis-elements for CdxA, AP-1, AML-1a, USF, v-Myb, and C/EBP in the fragment in question. Mutation of cis- elements for C/EBP reduced significant HMGB1 promoter activity induced by Tax. These findings indicate that Tax enhances the expression of HMGB1 gene at the transcriptional level, possibly by interacting with C/EBP.((PMID:23454006))Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a multi-functional transcription factor in the IRF family exhibiting both transcriptional activating and repressing activities. In this study, an IRF-2 gene (HcIRF-2) from Hyriopsis cumingii was identified and characterized. The cDNA sequence consisted of 2688 bp, encoding a 329 amino acid-protein. The amino acid sequence had a highly conserved N-terminal DBD structure, containing characteristic repeats of six tryptophan residues. The 5'-flanking region contained several transcription regulation elements such as AP1, CdxA, HSF, NIT2 and HNF-3b. Nine SNPs were obtained through direct sequencing of HcIRF-2 from resistant and susceptible stock. Only +2365T/C SNP was significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to Aeromonas hydrophila both in genotype (P = 0.021) and allele (P = 0.006) analysis. The SNPs +2248T/C and +2365T/C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TT frequency in the resistant group was significantly higher than in the susceptible group. The mortality in +2248CC genotype individuals was significantly higher than in CT and TT genotype individuals. These results indicated that haplotype TT and genotype +2248CT and +2248GT individuals were resistant to A. hydrophila, which could make them potential markers in selective breeding of H. cumingii.((PMID:23208143))Based on the cDNA sequence of GPX in Hyriopsis cumingii, the complete genomic DNA of GPX gene and it's 5'-flanking region were identified from H. cumingii using PCR and genome walking technique. The length of the complete genomic sequence was 6 708 bp including the 5'-flanking region, two exons, and one intron. Sequence analysis of the 992 bp 5'-flanking region revealed that it contained a core promoter element (TATA-box) and other transcription regulation elements such as AP1, C/EBP, and CdxA. The sequence lengths of the two exons were 273 bp and 991 bp, respectively, and the intron was 4 491 bp in length. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the GPX gene from resistant stock (RS) and susceptible stock (SS) of H. cumingii. These polymorphisms were analyzed with regard to resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila. Among them, three SNPs including A-99G, A-86C, and A-49C in GPX promoter and five SNPs including A2841T, C2847T, G3146C, A3150G, and G4645T in GPX introns were associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to A. hydrophila, both in genotype and allele frequency. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that A-86C, A-49C, C2847T, A3150G, G4645T, A2841T, and G3146C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (ACTGT and TG) in the resistant group was significantly higher than that in the susceptible group. The results suggest that the polymorphic loci in the GPX gene could be potential genetic markers for future molecular selection of strains resistant to diseases.((PMID:22578123))Investigating intestinal physiology in vitro remains challenging due to the lack of an effective primary enterocyte culture system. Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroids.((PMID:25049581))The production of therapeutic proteins from transgenic animals is one of the most important successes of animal biotechnology. Milk is presently the most mature system for production of therapeutic proteins from a transgenic animal. Specifically, β-casein is a major component of cow, goat and sheep milk, and its promoter has been used to regulate the expression of transgenic genes in the mammary gland of transgenic animals. Here, we cloned the porcine β-casein gene and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the promoter and intron 1 region of the porcine β-casein gene. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including SRY, CdxA, AML-a, GATA-3, GATA-1 and C/EBP β. In addition, the first intron of the porcine β-casein gene contained the transcriptional enhancers Oct-1, SRY, YY1, C/EBP β, and AP-1, as well as the retroviral TATA box. We estimated the transcriptional activity for the 5'-proximal region with or without intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene in HC11 cells stimulated with lactogenic hormones. High transcriptional activity was obtained for the 5'-proximal region with intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene. The β-casein gene containing the mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) was also cloned from another individual pig. Promoter activity of the luciferase vector containing the mutant TATA box was weaker than the same vector containing the normal TATA box. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transcription of porcine β-casein gene is regulated by lactogenic hormone via intron 1 and promoter containing a mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) has poor porcine β-casein gene activity.((PMID:22232350))To examine whether PARK16, which was recently identified as a protective locus for Parkinson disease (PD) in Asian, white, and South American populations, is also associated with PD in the genetically homogeneous Ashkenazi Jewish population.Case-control study.A medical center affiliated with a university. Subjects  Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located between RAB7L1 and SLC41A1 were analyzed in 720 patients with PD and 642 controls, all of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.Haplotypes were defined and risk estimates were determined for each SNP and haplotype. Bioinformatic analysis defined the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and the transcription factor binding sites that are potentially affected by 2 of the tested SNPs.All tested SNPs were significantly associated with PD (odds ratios = 0.64-0.76; P = .0002-.014). Two of them, rs1572931 and rs823144, were localized to the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and their sequence variations altered the predicted transcription factor binding sites of CdxA, p300, GATA-1, Sp1, and c-Ets-1. Only 0.4% of patients were homozygous for the protective rs1572931 genotype (T/T), compared with 3.0% among controls (P = 5 × 10(-5)). This SNP was included in a haplotype that reduced the risk for PD by 10- to 12-fold (P = .002-.01) in all patients with PD and in a subgroup of patients who do not carry the Ashkenazi founder mutations in the GBA or LRRK2 genes.Our data demonstrate that specific SNP variations and haplotypes in the PARK16 locus are associated with reduced risk for PD in Ashkenazim. Although it is possible that alterations in the putative promoter of RAB7L1 are associated with this effect, the role of other genes in this locus cannot be ruled out.((PMID:21948744))Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is a key element of D-type cyclin holoenzymes. It is involved in the regulation of the G1-phase of the cell cycle and is considered to be an important candidate gene for selection of body measurement traits through marker-assisted selection. We cloned the promoter sequence of this gene in bovines and found it to share high similarity with that of the human CDK6 promoter. A 2271-bp sequence upstream of the start codon in the bovine CDK6 5'-flanking sequence is rich in GC; it lacks consensus TATA or CAAT box, but it contains several MZF1 binding sites. Other potential cis-regulatory elements were found in the 5'-flanking region, including CdxA, SRY, p300, GATA-1, and deltaE. Allele frequencies were also analyzed in various cattle breeds (Qinchuan, Qinchuan improvement steers, Nanyang, Jiaxian red, Xia'nan, Luxi, Simmental and Luxi crossbred steers, and Xuelong) and association with a selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was calculated. The T-1075C SNP in the promoter was found to be significantly associated with body length and heart girth. This SNP marker was found to be significantly associated with body length and the heart girth in 737 individuals. We conclude that this SNP of the CDK6 gene has potential as a genetic marker for important body traits in bovine reproduction and breeding.((PMID:21191598))Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method to assess bone mineral density (BMD). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends the measurement of BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, but in certain circumstances the 33% radius may be the recommended area to measure BMD. The aim of this study has been to analyze whether 33% radius should be considered the recommended area to assess BMD in prostate cancer patients.This is a retrospective study where BMD was assessed by DXA at 33% radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck (cDXA) in 141 prostate cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients were hormone naïve while 113 were subjected to androgen suppression (AS) during the mean period of 29 months. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when T-score was lower than -2.5 and osteopenia when it ranged between -1 and -2.5.The osteoporosis rate was 29.8% at 33% radius, 23.4% at femoral neck, 19.9% at lumbar spine, and 12.8% at total hip. The overall osteoporosis rate at cDXA was 29.1%. Osteoporosis was detected in 52.2% at 33% radius and 36.2% at cDXA. Normal BMD was found in 17.7% at 33% radius and 34.8% at cDXA. The 33% radius was the only site where a significant increase in the osteoporosis rate was detected in patients subjected to AS compared to those hormone naïve (33 and 13.8%).The 33% radius seems more sensible than the central skeleton areas to detect bone mass loss in patients with prostate cancer.((PMID:20922565))Alkaline phosphatases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in many important biological processes. Mammalian tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase has long been thought to feature in embryonic development and bone formation. In this study, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene from Paralichthys olivaceus was identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and genome-walking PCR. The ALP gene extends 10,141 bp and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The open reading frame of the ALP transcript consists of 1,431 bp, which encodes 476 amino acids products named as POALP. An analysis of its secondary and tertiary structure revealed that the POALP was conserved in different species, but one disulfide linkage made it possible to adapt to low-temperature environment. The ALP activity was found to be first detectable in the embryo before hatching. The POALP was distributed ubiquitously in the body of P. olivaceus and was particularly high in the digestive tract. These findings suggest the potential role of POALP in nutrient absorption and transportation. During the pre-metamorphosis (F stage), ALP gene expression is 2.5-folds of that in the pro-metamorphosis (E stage); but in the post-metamorphosis (I stage), it was 1.8-folds of that of pro-metamorphosis. Exogenetic thyroxine (T4) and thiourea (TU) influenced the ALP gene expression significantly during the metamorphosis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that Japanese flounder ALP promoter region contained promoter sequence and putative recognition site for several transcriptional factors, including SREBP-1, SYR, and CdxA. In vitro promoter assays employing EGFP reporter system demonstrated that the promoter of ALP was active.((PMID:20190048))Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and contributes to the degradation of hemicellulose in the rumen. The genome of P. bryantii harbors four genes predicted to encode glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 (GH3) enzymes. To evaluate whether these genes encode enzymes with redundant biological functions, each gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that the enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities. One gene encoded a cellodextrinase (CdxA), and three genes encoded beta-xylosidase enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B, and Xyl3C) with different specificities for either para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates or substituted xylooligosaccharides. To identify the amino acid residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity within this family of enzymes, the roles of conserved residues (R177, K214, H215, M251, and D286) in Xyl3B were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation led to a severely decreased catalytic efficiency without a change in the overall structure of the mutant enzymes. Through amino acid sequence alignments, an amino acid residue (E115) that, when mutated to aspartic acid, resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX) with a concurrent 1.1-fold increase in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was identified. Amino acid residue E115 may therefore contribute to the discrimination between beta-xylosides and beta-glucosides. Our results demonstrate that each of the four GH3 enzymes has evolved to perform a specific role in lignopolysaccharide hydrolysis and provide insight into the role of active-site residues in catalysis and substrate specificity for GH3 enzymes.((PMID:20025925))More than ten bradykinin-related peptides and their cDNAs have been identified from amphibians, but their genes are unknown. In present study, four cDNAs encoding one, two, four and six copies of bradykinin-related peptides were cloned from the frog (Odorrana grahami) skin cDNA library, respectively. Three bradykinin-related peptides (bradykinin, Thr6-bradykinin, Leu5Thr6-bradykinin) were deduced from these four cDNA sequences. Based on the cDNA sequence, the gene sequence encoding an amphibian bradykinin-related peptide from O. grahami was determined. It is composed of 7481 base pairs including two exons and two introns. The first exon codes signal peptide and the second exon codes acidic spacer peptide and Thr6-bradykinin. The promoter region of the bradykinin gene contains several putative recognition sites for nuclear factors, such as SRY, GATA-1, LYF-1, DeltaE, CDXA, NKX-2.5, MIF1 and S8. The current work may facilitate to understand the regulation and possible functions of amphibian skin bradykinin-related peptides.((PMID:19826915))Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes, has been implicated in virus and double-stranded RNA mediated induction of IFN-α, IFN-β and RANTES, in virus-induced apoptosis and in tumor suppression. Promoter plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, but the characterization of the human IRF-3 promoter has not been systematically analyzed in HEK 293 cells. To characterize the human IRF-3 promoter, we have isolated a genomic clone of the human IRF-3 gene promoter region containing 1,000 nucleotides of the 5'- flanking region. Transient transfection of 5'-deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region -149/-93 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for full promoter activity. This region contains HSF, E2F, CdxA and c-Myb transcription factor binding sites. The E2F sites are highly conserved among IRF-3 promoter regions of mouse, rat and human. Therefore, it was suggested that this E2F site may be essential for basal promoter activity. Surprisingly, mutation of this E2F site increased the promoter activity by 2-fold. Furthermore, overexpression of E2F1 reduced the transcription activity by 80%. These results indicated that human IRF-3 gene core promoter was located within the region -149/-93 relative to the TSS. E2F1 transcription factor negatively regulates human IRF-3 gene promoter.((PMID:19516907))Endoderm organ primordia become specified between gastrulation and gut tube folding in Amniotes. Although the requirement for RA signaling for the development of a few individual endoderm organs has been established a systematic assessment of its activity along the entire antero-posterior axis has not been performed in this germ layer.RA is synthesized from gastrulation to somitogenesis in the mesoderm that is close to the developing gut tube. In the branchial arch region specific levels of RA signaling control organ boundaries. The most anterior endoderm forming the thyroid gland is specified in the absence of RA signaling. Increasing RA in anterior branchial arches results in thyroid primordium repression and the induction of more posterior markers such as branchial arch Hox genes. Conversely reducing RA signaling shifts Hox genes posteriorly in endoderm. These results imply that RA acts as a caudalizing factor in a graded manner in pharyngeal endoderm. Posterior foregut and midgut organ primordia also require RA, but exposing endoderm to additional RA is not sufficient to expand these primordia anteriorly. We show that in chick, in contrast to non-Amniotes, RA signaling is not only necessary during gastrulation, but also throughout gut tube folding during somitogenesis. Our results show that the induction of CdxA, a midgut marker, and pancreas induction require direct RA signaling in endoderm. Moreover, communication between CdxA(+) cells is necessary to maintain CdxA expression, therefore synchronizing the cells of the midgut primordium. We further show that the RA pathway acts synergistically with FGF4 in endoderm patterning rather than mediating FGF4 activity.Our work establishes that retinoic acid (RA) signaling coordinates the position of different endoderm organs along the antero-posterior axis in chick embryos and could serve as a basis for the differentiation of specific endodermal organs from ES cells.((PMID:18448117))Gene regulation during development is an important biological activity that leads to synthesis of biomolecules at specific locations and specific times. The single tropomyosin gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, tmy-1/lev-11, produces four isoforms of protein: two from the external promoter and two from the internal promoter. We investigated the internal promoter of tropomyosin to identify sequences that regulate expression of tmy-1 in the pharynx and intestine. By promoter deletion of tmy-1 reporters as well as by database analyses, a 100-bp fragment that contained binding sequences for a GATA factor, for a chicken CdxA homolog, and for a forkhead factor was identified. Both the forkhead and CdxA binding sequences contributed to pharyngeal and intestinal expression. In addition, the GATA site also influenced intestinal expression of tmy-1 reporter. We showed that ELT-2 and PHA-4 proteins interact directly with the GATA and forkhead binding sequences, respectively, in gel mobility shift assays. RNA interference knockdown of elt-2 diminished tmy-1::gfp expression in the intestine. In contrast to RNA interference knockdown of pha-4, expression of tmy-1::gfp in pha-4;smg-1 mutants was slightly weaker than that of the wild type. Ectopic expression of PHA-4 and ELT-2 by heat shock was sufficient to elicit widespread expression of tmy-1::lacZ reporter in embryos. We found no indication of a synergistic relation between ELT-2 and PHA-4. Based on our data, PHA-4 and CdxA function as general transcription factors for pharyngeal and intestinal regulation of tmy-1. We present models by which ELT-2, PHA-4, and CdxA orchestrate expression from the internal promoter of tmy-1.((PMID:12828791))Ingestion of carbohydrates from the small intestine is the major route of energy supply in animals. In mammals these functions develop both pre- and postnatally and are coordinated for the sucking period. In birds, the physiological requirements are different and hatchlings ingest diets rich in complex carbohydrates soon after hatching. The present study examined the ontogeny of intestinal carbohydrate uptake in the chicken. The expression of mRNA for a brush border enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase (SI), which is critical in disaccharide digestion, was determined, together with that of the Na-glucose transporter (SGLT)-1, which is the major apical glucose transporter, In addition, the homeobox gene cdx, which is involved in inducing SI expression in mammals was examined. It was found that the expression of cdxA mRNA and cdxA protein increased from day 15 of incubation until hatch, after which further changes were small. CdxA protein was shown to bind to the promoter region of SI in the chick indicating that cdxA is similar to the mammalian cdx2. The mRNA of SI was observed at 15 d incubation, increased from 17 d of incubation to a peak on day 19, decreased at hatch and had a further peak of expression 2 d post-hatch. In contrast, the mRNA of SGLT-1 was not detected until 19 d of incubation when a major peak of expression was observed followed by a decrease to low levels at hatch and small increases post-hatch. It appears that both SI and SGLT-1 mRNA are expressed before hatch in the chick, but the ontogeny of expression is controlled by different mechanisms.((PMID:8016095))The immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, E12 and E47, encoded by the E2A gene belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of regulatory proteins and act as transcriptional activators. In addition to their critical role in B-lymphocyte development, the E12 and E47 proteins have been implicated in the induction of myogenesis as heterodimeric partners of myogenic bHLH proteins, MyoD and myogenin. Here we demonstrate that the E2A proteins form heterodimers with the bHLH oncoprotein tal-1 in myeloid and erythroid cells and that these heterodimers specifically bind to the CANNTG DNA motif. Heterodimerization with tal-1 represses transactivation by E47 and could function to prevent the expression of immunoglobulin genes in cells other than B lymphocytes. DNA binding by E2A-tal-1 heterodimers in the M1 mouse myeloid cell line is abrogated upon terminal macrophage differentiation induced by the cytokine interleukin 6. The loss of E2A-tal-1 DNA binding is correlated with elevated expression of mRNA encoding the dominant negative HLH proteins, Id1 and particularly Id2. Moreover, recombinant Id proteins inhibit the E2A-tal-1-specific DNA binding activity from undifferentiated M1 cells. These results suggest that E2A-tal-1 heterodimers may play a role in preventing terminal differentiation in the myeloid lineage and provide a possible explanation for oncogenic transformation induced by ectopic tal-1 expression in acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias.((PMID:22311016))Meat quality traits are economically important traits of swine, and are controlled by multiple genes as complex quantitative traits. In the present study four genes, H-FABP (heart fatty acid-binding protein), MASTR (MEF2 activating motif and SAP domain containing transcriptional regulator), UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3) and MYOD1 (myogenic differentiation 1) were researched in Large White pigs. The polymorphisms H-FABP T/C of 5'UTR, MYOD1 g.257 A>C, UCP3 g.1406 G>A in exon 3 and MASTR c.187 C>T have been reported to be associated with meat quality traits in pigs. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of single and multiple markers for single traits in Large White pigs. The single marker association analysis showed that the H-FABP and MASTR genes were associated with IMF (intramuscular fat content) (P < 0.05), and that the g.257 A>C of MYOD1 gene was most significantly related to muscle pH value (P < 0.01). The multiple markers for IMF were analyzed by combining the markers and quantitative trait modes into the linear regression. The results revealed that H-FABP and MASTR integrate gene networks for IMF. Thus, our study results suggested that H-FABP and MASTR polymorphisms could be used as genetic markers in the marker-assisted selection towards the improvement of IMF in Large White pigs.((PMID:9118219))We isolated a Xenopus homolog of Frzb, a newly described protein containing an amino-terminal Frizzled motif. It dorsalized Xenopus embryos and was expressed in the Spemann organizer during early gastrulation. Unlike Frizzled proteins, endogenous Frzb was soluble. Frzb was secretable and could act across cell boundaries. In several functional assays, Frzb antagonized Xwnt-8, a proposed ventralizing factor with an expression pattern complementary to that of Frzb. Furthermore, Frzb blocked induction of MyoD, an action reported recently for a dominant-negative Xwnt-8. Frzb coimmunoprecipitated with Wnt proteins, providing direct biochemical evidence for Frzb-Wnt interactions. These observations implicate Frzb in axial patterning and support the concept that Frzb binds and inactivates Xwnt-8 during gastrulation, preventing inappropriate ventral signaling in developing dorsal tissues.((PMID:7665172))Transcription factors containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif regulate the expression of tissue-specific genes in a number of mammalian and insect systems. DNA-binding activity of the bHLH proteins is dependent upon formation of homo- and/or heterodimers. Dominant negative HLH proteins (Id-related genes) also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the DNA-binding basic domain. Consequently, Id proteins inhibit binding to DNA and transcriptional transactivation by heterodimerization with bHLH proteins. We report here the cDNA sequence of a novel human HLH gene (HGMW-approved symbol ID4) that lacks the basic domain. ID4 is differentially expressed in adult organs in four mRNA molecules, which are presumably a result of differential splicing and/or alternative usage of the polyadenylation sites. Transfection experiments indicated that enforced expression of Id-4H protein inhibits the trans-activation of the muscle creatine kinase E-box enhancer by MyoD. Finally, we localized the ID4 gene to the chromosome 6p21-p22 region.((PMID:8918463))The three ternary complex factors (TCFs), Net (ERP/ SAP-2), ELK-1 and SAP-1, are highly related ets oncogene family members that participate in the response of the cell to Ras and growth signals. Understanding the different roles of these factors will provide insights into how the signals result in coordinate regulation of the cell. We show that Net inhibits transcription under basal conditions, in which SAP-1a is inactive and ELK-1 stimulates. Repression is mediated by the NID, the Net Inhibitory Domain of about 50 amino acids, which autoregulates the Net protein and also inhibits when it is isolated in a heterologous fusion protein. Net is particularly sensitive to Ras activation. Ras activates Net through the C-domain, which is conserved between the three TCFs, and the NID is an efficient inhibitor of Ras activation. The NID, as well as more C-terminal sequences, inhibit DNA binding. Net is more refractory to DNA binding than the other TCFs, possibly due to the presence of multiple inhibitory elements. The NID may adopt a helix-loop-helix (HLH) structure, as evidenced by homology to other HLH motifs, structure predictions, model building and mutagenesis of critical residues. The sequence resemblance with myogenic factors suggested that Net may form complexes with the same partners. Indeed, we found that Net can interact in vivo with the basic HLH factor, E47. We propose that Net is regulated at the level of its latent DNA-binding activity by protein interactions and/or phosphorylation. Net may form complexes with HLH proteins as well as SRF on specific promotor sequences. The identification of the novel inhibitory domain provides a new inroad into exploring the different roles of the ternary complex factors in growth control and transformation.((PMID:27565872))I-mfa (inhibitor of the MyoD family a) is a transcription modulator that binds to MyoD family members and inhibits their transcriptional activities. It is highly expressed in the sclerotome and plays an important role in the patterning of the somite early in development. In this study, the polymorphisms of the bovine I-mfa gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA pool sequencing methods in 541 individuals from three Chinese cattle breeds. The results showed that P3 locus had two novel complete linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (NC_007324.4:g.12284A>G and g.12331T>C), resulting in a missense mutation p.S(AGC)113G(GGC) and a synonymous mutation p.H(CAT)128H(CAC), respectively. P4 locus had a novel SNP (NC_007324.4: g.16432C>A), which resulted in a nonsense mutation p.C(TGC)241X(TGA). The statistical analyses indicated that the three SNPs, are associated with the phenotypic traits in Luxi (LX), Qinchuan (QC), and Jiaxian (JX) cattle population (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The mutant-type variants were superior for growth traits; the heterozygote diplotype was associated with higher growth traits compared to wild-type homozygote. Our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in the I-mfa gene are associated with growth traits and may be used for marker-assisted selection in beef cattle breeding program.((PMID:27279047))Accumulating evidence suggests that Sirtuin (Sirt)1 serves a significant role in proliferation and differentiation of myoblast cells; however the signaling mechanisms involved remain to be established. Myostatin (MSTN), a member of transforming growth factor‑β family, is an vital regulator of myoblast, fibroblast growth and differentiation. To determine if MSTN is involved in the regulation of myoblast cell proliferation by Sirt1, the present study administrated the Sirt1 activator resveratrol, inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) and MSTN inhibitor SB431542 to C2C12 myoblast cells. It was demonstrated that the Sirt1 activator, resveratrol, repressed, whereas the Sirt1 inhibitor, NAM, enhanced C2C12 myoblast cells proliferation in a Sirt1‑dependent manner. SB431542 promoted the proliferation of C2C12 myoblast cells and reversed the inhibition effect of NAM on C2C12 myoblast cell proliferation. Additionally, resveratrol upregulated the mRNA expression of MyoD, but inhibited the expression of MSTN. Additionally, NAM significantly repressed the expression of MyoD and the phosphorylation of P107 (p‑P107), but enhanced the expression of MSTN and the protein expression of P107. SB431542 significantly mitigated the effect of NAM on the expression of MyoD, P107 and p‑P107. Taken together, these results indicated that Sirt1 promotes the proliferation of C2C12 myoblast cells via the MSTN signaling pathway.((PMID:27178573))Marek's disease (MD) is an infectious disease of chickens caused by MD virus (MDV), which is a herpesvirus that initiates tumor formation. Studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are linked with the development of cancers or tumors. Previously, gga-miR-130a was discovered downregulated in MDV-infected tissues. Here, we aimed to explore the further function of gga-miR-130a in MD. The expression of gga-miR-130a in MDV-infected and uninfected spleens was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, proliferation and migration assays of MDV-transformed lymphoid cells (MSB1) were carried out by transfecting gga-miR-130a. The target genes of gga-miR-130a were predicted using TargetScan and miRDB and clustered through Gene Ontology analysis. The target genes were validated by western blot, qRT-PCR, and a dual luciferase reporter assay. Our results show that the expression of gga-miR-130a was reduced in MDV-infected spleens. Gga-miR-130a showed an inhibitory effect on MSB1 cell proliferation and migration. Two target genes, homeobox A3 (HOXA3) and MyoD family inhibitor domain containing (MDFIC), were predicted and clustered to cell proliferation. Results indicate that gga-miR-130a regulates HOXA3 and MDFIC at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. Moreover, the gga-miR-130a binding sites of two target genes have been confirmed. We conclude that gga-miR-130a can arrest MSB1 cell proliferation and migration, and target HOXA3 and MDFIC, which are both involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Collectively, gga-miR-130a plays a critical role in the tumorigenesis associated with chicken MD.((PMID:26981231))Extracellular stimuli induce gene expression responses through intracellular signaling mediators. The p38 signaling pathway is a paradigm of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that, although originally identified as stress-response mediator, contributes to establishing stem cell differentiation fates. p38α is central for induction of the differentiation fate of the skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) through not fully characterized mechanisms.To investigate the global gene transcription program regulated by p38α during satellite cell differentiation (myogenesis), and to specifically address whether this regulation occurs through direct action of p38α on gene promoters, we performed a combination of microarray gene expression and genome-wide binding analyses. For experimental robustness, two myogenic cellular systems with genetic and chemical loss of p38α function were used: (1) satellite cells derived from mice with muscle-specific deletion of p38α, and (2) the C2C12 murine myoblast cell line cultured in the absence or presence of the p38α/β inhibitor SB203580. Analyses were performed at cell proliferation and early differentiation stages.We show that p38α binds to a large set of active promoters during the transition of myoblasts from proliferation to differentiation stages. p38α-bound promoters are enriched with binding motifs for several transcription factors, with Sp1, Tcf3/E47, Lef1, FoxO4, MyoD, and NFATc standing out in all experimental conditions. p38α association with chromatin correlates very well with high levels of transcription, in agreement with its classical function as an activator of myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, p38α also associates with genes repressed at the onset of differentiation, thus highlighting the relevance of p38-dependent chromatin regulation for transcriptional activation and repression during myogenesis.These results uncover p38α association and function on chromatin at novel classes of target genes during skeletal muscle cell differentiation. This is consistent with this MAPK isoform being a transcriptional regulator.((PMID:25501595))Acute muscle injury and physiological stress from chronic muscle diseases and aging lead to impairment of skeletal muscle function. This raises the question of whether p53, a cellular stress sensor, regulates muscle tissue repair under stress conditions. By investigating muscle differentiation in the presence of genotoxic stress, we discovered that p53 binds directly to the myogenin promoter and represses transcription of myogenin, a member of the MyoD family of transcription factors that plays a critical role in driving terminal muscle differentiation. This reduction of myogenin protein is observed in G1-arrested cells and leads to decreased expression of late but not early differentiation markers. In response to acute genotoxic stress, p53-mediated repression of myogenin reduces post-mitotic nuclear abnormalities in terminally differentiated cells. This study reveals a mechanistic link previously unknown between p53 and muscle differentiation, and suggests new avenues for managing p53-mediated stress responses in chronic muscle diseases or during muscle aging.((PMID:24644423))Birth weight is an economically important trait in pig production because it directly impacts piglet growth and survival rate. In the present study, we performed a genome wide survey of candidate genes and pathways associated with individual birth weight (IBW) using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip on 24 high (HEBV) and 24 low estimated breeding value (LEBV) animals. These animals were selected from a reference population of 522 individuals produced by three sires and six dam lines, which were crossbreds with multiple breeds. After quality-control, 43,257 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), including 42,243 autosomal SNPs and 1,014 SNPs on chromosome X, were used in the data analysis. A total of 27 differentially selected regions (DSRs), including 1 on Sus scrofa chromosome 1 (SSC1), 1 on SSC4, 2 on SSC5, 4 on SSC6, 2 on SSC7, 5 on SSC8, 3 on SSC9, 1 on SSC14, 3 on SSC18, and 5 on SSCX, were identified to show the genome wide separations between the HEBV and LEBV groups for IBW in piglets. A DSR with the most number of significant SNPs (including 7 top 0.1% and 31 top 5% SNPs) was located on SSC6, while another DSR with the largest genetic differences in F ST was found on SSC18. These regions harbor known functionally important genes involved in growth and development, such as TNFRSF9 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9), CA6 (carbonic anhydrase VI) and MDFIC (MyoD family inhibitor domain containing). A DSR rich in imprinting genes appeared on SSC9, which included PEG10 (paternally expressed 10), SGCE (sarcoglycan, epsilon), PPP1R9A (protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 9A) and ASB4 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 4). More importantly, our present study provided evidence to support six quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions for pig birth weight, six QTL regions for average birth weight (ABW) and three QTL regions for litter birth weight (LBW) reported previously by other groups. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis with 183 genes harbored in these 27 DSRs suggested that protein, metal, ion and ATP binding, viral process and innate immune response present important pathways for deciphering their roles in fetal growth or development. Overall, our study provides useful information on candidate genes and pathways for regulating birth weight in piglets, thus improving our understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in porcine embryonic or fetal development.((PMID:24470334))Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are the most frequent soft tissue sarcomas in children that share many features of developing skeletal muscle. We have discovered that a T-box family member, TBX2, is highly upregulated in tumor cells of both major RMS subtypes. TBX2 is a repressor that is often overexpressed in cancer cells and is thought to function in bypassing cell growth control, including repression of p14 and p21. The cell cycle regulator p21 is required for the terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle cells and is silenced in RMS cells. We have found that TBX2 interacts with the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin and inhibits the activity of these factors. TBX2 is expressed in primary myoblasts and C2C12 cells, but is strongly downregulated upon differentiation. TBX2 recruits the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and is a potent inhibitor of the expression of muscle-specific genes and the cell cycle regulators, p21 and p14. TBX2 promotes the proliferation of RMS cells and either depletions of TBX2 or dominant negative TBX2 upregulate p21- and muscle-specific genes. Significantly, depletion or interference with TBX2 completely inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft assay, highlighting the oncogenic role of TBX2 in RMS cells. Thus, the data demonstrate that elevated expression of TBX2 contributes to the pathology of RMS cells by promoting proliferation and repressing differentiation-specific gene expression. These results show that deregulated TBX2 serves as an oncogene in RMS, suggesting that TBX2 may serve as a new diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for RMS tumors.((PMID:23770672))Ca(2+) signaling is essential for bone homeostasis and skeletal development. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) channel and the inhibitor of MyoD family, I-mfa, function antagonistically in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. I-mfa null mice have an osteopenic phenotype characterized by increased osteoclast numbers and surface, which are normalized in mice lacking both Trpc1 and I-mfa. In vitro differentiation of pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa-deficient mice leads to an increased number of mature osteoclasts and higher bone resorption per osteoclast. These parameters return to normal levels in osteoclasts derived from double mutant mice. Consistently, whole cell currents activated in response to the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores are larger in pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa knock-out mice compared with currents in wild type mice and normalized in cells derived from double mutant mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of I-mfa on TRPC1 in these cells. A new splice variant of TRPC1 (TRPC1ε) was identified in early pre-osteoclasts. Heterologous expression of TRPC1ε in HEK293 cells revealed that it is unique among all known TRPC1 isoforms in its ability to amplify the activity of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, mediating store-operated currents. TRPC1ε physically interacts with Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel, and I-mfa is recruited to the TRPC1ε-Orai1 complex through TRPC1ε suppressing CRAC channel activity. We propose that the positive and negative modulation of the CRAC channel by TRPC1ε and I-mfa, respectively, fine-tunes the dynamic range of the CRAC channel regulating osteoclastogenesis.((PMID:23570531))PCAF (KAT2B) belongs to the GNAT family of lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) and specifically acetylates the histone H3K9 residue and several nonhistone proteins. PCAF is also a transcriptional coactivator. Due to the lack of a PCAF KAT-specific small molecule inhibitor, the exclusive role of the acetyltransferase activity of PCAF is not well understood. Here, we report that a natural compound of the hydroxybenzoquinone class, embelin, specifically inhibits H3Lys9 acetylation in mice and inhibits recombinant PCAF-mediated acetylation with near complete specificity in vitro. Furthermore, using embelin, we have identified the gene networks that are regulated by PCAF during muscle differentiation, further highlighting the broader regulatory functions of PCAF in muscle differentiation in addition to the regulation via MyoD acetylation.((PMID:23296833))Satellite cells are the resident stem cell population of adult skeletal muscle tissue that is responsible for growth and regeneration. The cells typically congregate near the tips of the muscle fibers and in close proximity to the neural muscular junction (NMJ). Ephrin-A5 is a chemotactic molecule that participates in the correct positioning and formation of the NMJ. The objective of the experiment was to examine the effects of ephrin-A5 signaling on bovine satellite cell (BSC) biology. Primary cultures of BSC demonstrate changes in velocity with time in culture that is unique to the Paired box protein 7 (Pax7):Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) subpopulation. Treatment of the BSC with ephrin-A5 causes a reduction (P < 0.05) in velocity with a concomitant increase (P < 0.05) in directed migration. The chemoattractant properties of ephrin-A5 occur before myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) expression in the myogenic precursors and are abrogated after their differentiation to committed myoblasts. Ephrin-A5 induced migration appears to require components of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling machinery. Supplementation of culture media with a chemical ROCK inhibitor suppressed (P < 0.05) ephrin-A5 initiated BSC migration. These results contrast with treatment of BSC with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a key modulator of myogenic and motogenic activity. Treatment of BSC with HGF had no effect on cell motility or migration immediately after culture establishment. Twenty-four hours after culture establishment, BSC demonstrated an increase (P < 0.05) in transwell migration toward HGF. These results document that temporal and spatial gradients of chemokines and growth factors participate in the localization of BSC within the niche.((PMID:22991226))The class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as transcriptional repressors by altering chromatin structure through histone deacetylation. This family of enzymes regulates muscle development and phenotype, through regulation of muscle-specific genes including myogenin and MyoD (MYOD1). More recently, class IIa HDACs have been implicated in regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism. However, the effects of HDAC5 on glucose metabolism and insulin action have not been directly assessed. Knockdown of HDAC5 in human primary muscle cells increased glucose uptake and was associated with increased GLUT4 (SLC2A4) expression and promoter activity but was associated with reduced GLUT1 (SLC2A1) expression. There was no change in PGC-1α (PPARGC1A) expression. The effects of HDAC5 knockdown on glucose metabolism were not due to alterations in the initiation of differentiation, as knockdown of HDAC5 after the onset of differentiation also resulted in increased glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. These data show that inhibition of HDAC5 enhances metabolism and insulin action in muscle cells. As these processes in muscle are dysregulated in metabolic disease, HDAC inhibition could be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve muscle metabolism in these diseases. Therefore, we also examined the effects of the pan HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid, on muscle cell metabolism. In myotubes, Scriptaid increased histone 3 acetylation, GLUT4 expression, glucose uptake and both oxidative and non-oxidative metabolic flux. Together, these data suggest that HDAC5 regulates muscle glucose metabolism and insulin action and that HDAC inhibitors can be used to modulate these parameters in muscle cells.((PMID:22120524))Skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated by transcription factors, including members of the myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) family and many signaling pathways. The JAK1 and JAK2 pathways are known to each have different effects on myoblast proliferation and differentiation; however, the role of JAK3 in myoblast differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of JAK3 inhibition on myogenic differentiation in the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line. During myogenic differentiation, treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor WHIp154 significantly increased the number of MHC-positive multinucleated myotubes and the expressions of myosin heavy chain (MHC), myogenin (MGN), MyoD, and myogenic enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Knockdown of the JAK3 gene using siJAK3 also significantly increased MHC, MGN and MyoD mRNA expressions as well as insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene expression. During differentiation, JAK3 was initially activated and later decreased. Differentiation decreased STAT1, which was further decreased by WHIp154. In contrast, STAT3 gradually was elevated during differentiation, and was increased by JAK3 inhibition. Moreover, we found that up-regulation of AKT activity and down-regulation of ERK activity cooperated to accelerate myogenic differentiation. Taken together, these data indicate that JAK3 inhibition potently facilitates myoblast differentiation through antagonistic STAT1/STAT3 activities. Additionally, JAK3 inhibition induced precocious differentiation and played important roles for terminal differentiation, including fusion, which is involved with regulation of AKT and ERK pathways.((PMID:21268083))The present study evaluated endogenous activities and the role of BMP and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), representative members of the TGF-β family, during myotube differentiation in C2C12 cells. Smad phosphorylation at the C-terminal serines was monitored, since TGF-β family members signal via the phosphorylation of Smads in a ligand-dependent manner. Expression of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, which is an indicator of BMP activity, was higher before differentiation, and rapidly decreased after differentiation stimulation. Differentiation-related changes were consistent with those in the expression of Ids, well-known BMP-responsive genes. Treatment with inhibitors of BMP type I receptors or noggin in C2C12 myoblasts down-regulated the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, such as Myf5 and MyoD, leading to impaired myotube formation. Addition of BMP-2 during the myoblast phase also inhibited myotube differentiation through the down-regulation of Myf5 and MyoD. In contrast to endogenous BMP activity, the phosphorylation of Smad2, a TGF-β-responsive Smad, was higher 8-16 days after differentiation stimulation. A-83-01, an inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor, increased the expression of Myf5 and MyoD, and enhanced myotube formation. The present results reveal that endogenous activities of the TGF-β family are changed during myogenesis in a pathway-specific manner, and that the activities are required for myogenesis.((PMID:21147088))Differentiation often requires conversion of analogue signals to a stable binary output through positive feedback. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling promotes myogenesis in the vertebrate somite, in part by raising the activity of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs) of the Myod family above a threshold. Hh is known to enhance MRF expression. Here we show that Hh is also essential at a second step that increases Myod protein activity, permitting it to promote Myogenin expression. Hh acts by inducing expression of cdkn1c (p57(Kip2)) in slow muscle precursor cells, but neither Hh nor Cdkn1c is required for their cell cycle exit. Cdkn1c co-operates with Myod to drive differentiation of several early zebrafish muscle fibre types. Myod in turn up-regulates cdkn1c, thereby providing a positive feedback loop that switches myogenic cells to terminal differentiation.((PMID:20956996))Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine of the interleukin-6 family and plays important roles during inflammation. However, its roles in myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration remain unexplored. We show here that OSM potently inhibited myoblast differentiation mainly by activating the JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathway. OSM downregulated myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2A (MEF2A), upregulated the expression of Id1 and Id2, and inhibited the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MEF2. In addition, OSM also enhanced the expression of STAT3 and OSM receptor, which constituted a positive feedback loop to further amplify OSM-induced signaling. Moreover, we found that STAT1 physically associated with MEF2 and repressed its transcriptional activity, which could account for the OSM-mediated repression of MEF2. Although undetectable in normal muscles in vivo, OSM was rapidly induced on muscle injury and then promptly downregulated just before the majority of myoblasts differentiate. Prolonged expression of OSM in muscles compromised the regeneration process without affecting myoblast proliferation, suggesting that OSM functions to prevent proliferating myoblasts from premature differentiation during the early phase of muscle regeneration.((PMID:20641378))Firefly luciferase (Fluc) is an oxygenase extracted from Photinus pyralis with a molecular weight of 62 kDa (1). In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and O2, Fluc oxidizes the heterocyclic substrate d-luciferin to oxyluciferin and emits light in the wavelength range of 400–620 nm (2). The active site of Fluc comprises two distinct domains, a large N-terminal domain (residue 4–436) and a small C-terminal domain (residue 440–544), which are separated by a wide cleft (1). Splitting Fluc into N- and C-terminal fragments destroys its enzymatic activity, resulting in a complete loss of bioluminescence. The enzymatic activity or bioluminescence can be restored if the N- and C-terminal fragments are in close proximity (3). This led to the development of a novel labeling strategy for imaging protein–protein interactions in vivo, the split reporter (4). In this method, reporters like Fluc are dissected into two fragments and fused to a pair of proteins (A and B) that strongly interact with each other. The enzymatic activity of Fluc can be restored via two split reporter approaches: a complementation strategy and a reconstitution strategy. In the complementation strategy, protein A is connected with the N-terminal fragment of Fluc, and protein B is connected with the C-terminal fragment of Fluc. Interaction between protein A and B recovers the enzymatic activity of Fluc by bringing the two fragments of Fluc closely together. In the reconstitution strategy, protein A is connected with the N-terminal of one-half of a protein splicing system such as DNA polymerase III (N-intein DnaE) followed by N-terminal fragment of Fluc. Protein B is linked to the C-terminal of the other half of the splicing system (C-intein DnaE) followed by the C-terminal fragment of Fluc. The interaction between protein A and B brings the N- and C-inteins together, resulting in the joining of N- and C-terminal fragments of Fluc by a peptide bond and a release of a fully reconstituted protein Fluc. Both split enzyme approaches allow for recovery of bioluminescence. MyoD is a myogenic regulatory protein that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors (5). MyoD activates myogenesis by binding directly to the control region of muscle-specific genes, and it converts fibroblasts into skeletal muscle. The helices in MyoD bind tightly with other HLH factors such as Id to form a heterodimer. Id, also known as an inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding, lacks the basic domain for DNA binding and acts as dominant negative regulator in myogenesis or other cell proliferations (6). Id protein-firefly luciferase N-fragment & firefly luciferase C-fragment-MyoD protein (Id-NFluc & CFluc-MyoD) make up a pair of interacting proteins attached to the split Fluc fragments (7). Id-NFluc & CFluc-MyoD can be prepared with complementation strategy or reconstitution strategy, and are employed for in vivo imaging of the interaction between Id and MyoD via the produced bioluminescence.((PMID:20417616))Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein has been reported to interact with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) and to negatively regulate its activity, leading to stimulation of GSK-3beta-dependent beta-catenin degradation. We show here that the I-mfa domain proteins, HIC (human I-mfa domain-containing protein) and I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family a), interacted in vivo with LANA through their C-terminal I-mfa domains. This interaction affected the intracellular localization of HIC, inhibited the LANA-dependent transactivation of a beta-catenin-regulated reporter construct, and decreased the level of the LANA.GSK-3beta complex. These data reveal for the first time that I-mfa domain proteins interact with LANA and negatively regulate LANA-mediated activation of Wnt signaling-dependent transcription by inhibiting the formation of the LANA.GSK-3beta complex.((PMID:20235117))MyoD is a DNA-binding protein capable of specific interactions that involve the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. The HLH motif of MyoD can form oligomers with the HLH motif of Id1 (the inhibitor of DNA-binding proteins) that folds into a highly stable helical conformation stabilized by the self-association. The Id family consists of four related proteins that contain a highly conserved dimerization motif known as the HLH domain. In signaling pathways, Id proteins act as dominant negative antagonists of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors which play important roles in cellular development, proliferation, and differentiation. The mechanism of Id proteins is to antagonize bHLH proteins by binding as dominant negative HLH proteins to form high-affinity heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, thereby preventing them from binding to DNA and inhibiting transcription of differentiation-associated genes. The goal of this study is to design and synthesize peptide fragments of MyoD with high affinity for Id1 to interrupt the interactions among Id1, MyoD, and other bHLH DNA-binding proteins and to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Affinity of each peptide for Id1 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The secondary structure of each peptide was studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Biological effects of each peptide in several cancer cells such as breast and colon cancer cells were analyzed. Results demonstrated that the peptide 3C (H-Tyr-Ile-Glu-Gly-Leu-Gln-Ala-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asp-Gln-NH(2)) not only showed high affinity for Id1 but also exhibited antiproliferative effects in HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cells; the IC(50) value of 3C was determined as 25 microM in both cells. The percentage of sub-G1 in the cell cycle of the cancer cells treated with 5 microM of 3C was increased, indicating the induced apoptosis of cancer cells by 3C. Taken together, the peptide 3C is a promising lead compound for the development of antiproliferative agents.((PMID:19520771))Most growth factors stimulate myoblast proliferation and prevent differentiation, whereas insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) promote myoblast differentiation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs) are involved in cell growth and differentiation via activation of pro-growth factors. However, the role of SPCs in myogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we show that PACE4, a member of the SPC family, plays a critical role in myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. PACE4 mRNA levels increased markedly during myogenesis, whereas the expression of other member of SPC family, furin and PC6, remained unchanged. The expression pattern of pro-IGF-II, which is processed extracellularly by SPCs, was similar to that of PACE4. The expression of shRNA targeting PACE4, but not furin, suppressed the expression of the muscle-specific myosin light chain (MLC). Interestingly, reduced expression of MLC was restored following treatment with recombinant mature IGF-II. Finally, we demonstrated that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the induction of PACE4 mRNA, a result not observed when another myogenic differentiation inhibitor, SB203580 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor), was employed, indicating the presence of a positive feedback loop regulating PACE4 expression. These results suggest that PACE4 plays an important role in myogenic differentiation through its association with the IGF-II pathway.((PMID:19090724))Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus is an RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm, but the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein localizes specifically in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected cells. Nuclear localization of N is non-essential for PRRSV replication in cultured cells but has been shown to modulate the pathogenesis of virus in pigs, suggesting that N plays an accessory role in the nucleus during infection. We identified by yeast two-hybrid screening the inhibitor of MyoD family-a (I-mfa) domain-containing protein (HIC) as a cellular partner for PRRS virus (PRRSV) N protein. This protein is a homolog of human HIC, a recently identified cellular transcription factor. The specific interaction of PRRSV N with HIC was confirmed in cells by mammalian two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro by GST pull-down assay. HIC is a zinc-binding protein and confocal microscopy demonstrated co-localization of N with the HIC-p40 isomer in the nucleus and nucleolus, and in the cytoplasm with HIC-p32, which is the N-terminal truncation of HIC-p40. The porcine homolog of HIC is universally expressed in pig tissues including alveolar macrophages. The interaction of viral capsid with the cellular transcription factor implicates a possible regulation of host cell gene expression by the N protein during PRRSV infection.((PMID:27693641))((PMID:26469549))The I-mfa domain proteins HIC (also known as MDFIC) and I-mfa (also known as MDFI) are candidate tumor suppressor genes that are involved in cellular and viral transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that HIC and I-mfa directly interact with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein in vitro. In addition, HIC and I-mfa repress Tax-dependent transactivation of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) reporter construct in COS-1, Jurkat and high-Tax-producing HTLV-1-infected T cells. HIC also interacts with Tax through its I-mfa domain in vivo and represses Tax-dependent transactivation of HTLV-1 LTR and NF-κB reporter constructs in an interaction-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that HIC decreases the nuclear distribution and stimulates the proteasomal degradation of Tax. These data reveal that HIC specifically interacts with HTLV-1 Tax and negatively regulates Tax transactivational activity by altering its subcellular distribution and stability.((PMID:26384474))CD180, a related member of the Toll-like receptor family, is lost or underexpressed at the plasma membrane in circulating cells of various B-cell lymphomas except marginal zone lymphomas (MZL). In order to confirm its clinical relevance in routine analysis, we evaluated prospectively the expression of CD180 in 236 patients from 5 French University Hospital laboratories on behalf of the GEIL. Highly comparable results were obtained in all centers using the EuroFlow standardization protocol. We observed that CD180 median fluorescence (MdFI) was significantly higher in MZL and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) compared to all other B-cell proliferations (P < 0.05). CD180 intensity could distinguish lymphomas with numerous villous lymphocytes from other MZL. ROC curve analysis identified a CD180 MdFI threshold for which the diagnosis of MZL could be assessed with 77% sensitivity and 92% specificity. This study showed that CD180 can be considered as a single positive robust marker of MZL and should be therefore included in flow cytometry panels for the diagnosis of mature B-cell neoplasms. Harmonization process is of great interest in order to evaluate new markers in multicentric studies and to set up decisional thresholds. © 2015 International Clinical Cytometry Society.((PMID:26183718))We determined the effect of p53 activation on de novo protein synthesis using quantitative proteomics (pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture/pSILAC) in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480. This was combined with mRNA and noncoding RNA expression analyses by next generation sequencing (RNA-, miR-Seq). Furthermore, genome-wide DNA binding of p53 was analyzed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq). Thereby, we identified differentially regulated proteins (542 up, 569 down), mRNAs (1258 up, 415 down), miRNAs (111 up, 95 down) and lncRNAs (270 up, 123 down). Changes in protein and mRNA expression levels showed a positive correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.0001). In total, we detected 133 direct p53 target genes that were differentially expressed and displayed p53 occupancy in the vicinity of their promoter. More transcriptionally induced genes displayed occupied p53 binding sites (4.3% mRNAs, 7.2% miRNAs, 6.3% lncRNAs, 5.9% proteins) than repressed genes (2.4% mRNAs, 3.2% miRNAs, 0.8% lncRNAs, 1.9% proteins), suggesting indirect mechanisms of repression. Around 50% of the down-regulated proteins displayed seed-matching sequences of p53-induced miRNAs in the corresponding 3'-UTRs. Moreover, proteins repressed by p53 significantly overlapped with those previously shown to be repressed by miR-34a. We confirmed up-regulation of the novel direct p53 target genes LINC01021, MDFI, ST14 and miR-486 and showed that ectopic LINC01021 expression inhibits proliferation in SW480 cells. Furthermore, KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT mRNAs were confirmed as direct targets of the p53-induced miR-34a, miR-205 and miR-486-5p, respectively. In line with the loss of p53 function during tumor progression, elevated expression of KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT was detected in advanced stages of cancer. In conclusion, the integration of multiple omics methods allowed the comprehensive identification of direct and indirect effectors of p53 that provide new insights and leads into the mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression.((PMID:26126114))Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that is clinically classified into several subtypes. Among these subtypes, basal-like breast cancer largely overlaps with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and these two groups are generally studied together as a single entity. Differences in the molecular makeup of breast cancers can result in different treatment strategies and prognoses for patients with different breast cancer subtypes. Compared with other subtypes, basal-like and other ER+ breast cancer subtypes exhibit marked differences in etiologic factors, clinical characteristics and therapeutic potential. Anthracycline drugs are typically used as the first-line clinical treatment for basal-like breast cancer subtypes. However, certain patients develop drug resistance following chemotherapy, which can lead to disease relapse and death. Even among patients with basal-like breast cancer, there can be significant molecular differences, and it is difficult to identify specific drug resistance proteins in any given patient using conventional variance testing methods. Therefore, we designed a new method for identifying drug resistance genes. Subgroups, personalized biomarkers, and therapy targets were identified using cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes. We found that basal-like breast cancer could be further divided into at least four distinct subgroups, including two groups at risk for drug resistance and two groups characterized by sensitivity to pharmacotherapy. Based on functional differences among these subgroups, we identified nine biomarkers related to drug resistance: SYK, LCK, GAB2, PAWR, PPARG, MDFI, ZAP70, CIITA and ACTA1. Finally, based on the deviation scores of the examined pathways, 16 pathways were shown to exhibit varying degrees of abnormality in the various subgroups, indicating that patients with different subtypes of basal-like breast cancer can be characterized by differences in the functional status of these pathways. Therefore, these nine differentially expressed genes and their associated functional pathways should provide the basis for novel personalized clinical treatments of basal-like breast cancer.((PMID:25472652))DNA methylation is a potential tumor marker for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), because of its heritable and stable characteristics.Using a high-resolution, genome-wide approach, we epigenotyped >450,000 CpG sites in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 23 microsatellite instability (MSI)/microsatellite stability (MSS) CRC cases. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the methylation status of five frequently hypermethylated genes were confirmed in 75 independent CRC series and 353 CRC patients with available plasma.Compared with non-tumor tissues, 13 MSI tumors had 34,836 (7 %) aberrant methylation sites, 87 % of which were hypermethylated. In contrast, only 9,806 (2 %) differentially methylated sites were identified in ten MSS cases (62 % hypermethylated). In both MSI and MSS, 228 promoter-associated CpG islands were hypermethylated, with AGBL4, ZNF625, MDFI, TWIST1, and FLI1 being most frequently hypermethylated. In an independent set of 35 MSI and 40 MSS cases, the methylation status of these five genes significantly differed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Of 353 CRC patients, 230 (65.2 %), 232 (65.7 %), and 247 (70.0 %) had AGBL4, FLI1, and TWIST1 promoter hypermethylation in circulating cell-free DNA, respectively. In patients without metastasis, the sensitivity of any two or three hypermethylation markers was 52.8-57.8 and 27.9-38.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of any two or three markers was significantly high in patients with stage IV disease (73.0 and 55.6 %, respectively). The prognostic value of these epimarkers was inconclusive.DNA methylation patterns differed in CRC subtypes. The identified hypermethylation markers in CRC patients may have good sensitivity in different CRC stages.((PMID:22681909))The common genes responsible for the characteristics of primary cultured invasive phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were investigated. Primary cultured HCC cells from three patients were separated by Matrigel invasion into parent and invasive cells. Whole human genome oligo microarray was applied to detect the differentially expressed genes in invasive cells. A purchased HCC cell line (HA 22T/VGH) was studied for comparison. Forty genes were consistently up-regulated and 14 genes were consistently down-regulated among primary cultured invasive cells. Among these genes, only three up-regulated genes (CNN1, PLAT, SPARC) and one down-regulated tumor suppressor gene (MDFI) had same expressions in invasive cells originated from purchased cell line. For primary cultured invasive cells, differential expressions of several groups of common genes are known to have capacities to promote proliferation (CAV1, IL6, PLAT, RRAD, SRPX), remodeling of extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, NID2, TNC, RELN, SPARC), migration (ACTG2, CAV1, CCL2, CCL26, CDC42EP3, CNN1, PHLDB2, PLAT, RRAD, SRPX), implantation (IL6), immune escape (CD70) and angiogenesis (CCL2, IL6, IL18, PLAT, SLIT3). Two genes related to signal transduction (AXL, RASL10B) and one related to metabolism (PTGS2) also showed consistent expressions. Differential expressions of these genes are capable for tumor invasiveness. In conclusion, the characteristics of invasive phenotype HCC cells are originated from differential expressions of several groups of genes rather than few target genes. This information may give us a new insight to design new stratagems in HCC treatment. Analysis of the results from a purchased cell line may have bias due to long-term repeated in vitro cultures.((PMID:22194164))Many QTLs for fatness traits have been mapped on pig chromosome 7q1.1-1.4 in various pig resource populations. Eight novel markers, including seven SNPs and one insertion or deletion within BTNL1, COL21A1, PPARD, GLP1R, MDFI, GNMT, ABCC10, and PLA2G7 genes, as well as two previously reported SNPs in SLC39A7 and HMGA1 genes, were genotyped in Large White and Meishan pig breeds. Except for two SNPs in HMGA1 and ABCC10 genes, allele frequencies of the other eight markers are highly significant different between Chinese indigenous Meishan breeds and Large White pig breeds. Eight polymorphic sites were then used for linkage and QTL mapping to refine the fatness QTL in a Large White × Meishan F(2) resource population. Five chromosome-wise significant QTLs were detected, of which the QTLs for leaf fat weight, backfat thickness at 6-7th rib and rump, and mean backfat thickness were narrowed to the interval between PPARD and GLP1R genes and the QTL for backfat thickness at thorax-waist between GNMT and PLA2G7 genes on SSC7p1.1-q1.4.((PMID:22083596))Pancreatic cancer (PanC) presents at late stage with high mortality. Effective early detection methods are needed. Aberrantly methylated genes are unexplored as markers for noninvasive detection by stool testing. The authors aimed to select discriminant methylated genes and to assess accuracy of these and mutant KRAS in stool to detect PanC.Nine target genes were assayed by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in bisulfite-treated DNA from microdissected frozen specimens of 24 PanC cases and 30 normal colon controls. Archived stools from 58 PanC cases and 65 controls matched on sex, age, and smoking were analyzed. Target genes from fecal supernatants were enriched by hybrid capture, bisulfite-treated, and assayed by MSP. KRAS mutations were assayed using the QuARTS technique.Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs) for tissue BMP3, NDRG4, EYA4, UCHL1, MDFI, Vimentin, CNTNAP2, SFRP2, and TFPI2 were 0.90, 0.79, 0.78, 0.78, 0.77, 0.77, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.66, respectively. The top 4 markers and mutant KRAS were evaluated in stool. BMP3 was the most discriminant methylation marker in stool. At 90% specificity, methylated BMP3 alone detected 51% of PanCs, mutant KRAS detected 50%, and combination detected 67%. AUCs for methylated BMP3, mutant KRAS, and combination in stool were 0.73, 0.75, and 0.85, respectively.This study demonstrates that stool assay of a methylated gene marker can detect PanC. Among candidate methylated markers discriminant in tissue, BMP3 alone performed well in stool. Combining methylated BMP3 and mutant KRAS increased stool detection over either marker alone.((PMID:21813317))In this paper, three kinds of imidazole derivatives, 2-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (MDFI), 2-(4-nitrophenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (NDFI), and 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (t-BDFI) were synthesized. In an alkaline medium, the chemiluminescence (CL) reaction of imidazole derivatives with H(2)O(2) has been investigated. It was also found that MDFI/H(2)O(2) and t-BDFI/H(2)O(2) systems gave strong CL. When Co(2+) was added into the two CL systems, the CL intensity was remarkably enhanced. In the optimum conditions, the CL intensity is linearly related to the logarithm of concentration of Co(2+). The linear ranges are 5×10(-9)-2.5×10(-7) mol/L for MDFI/H(2)O(2) system and 5×10(-9)-2.5×10(-7) mol/L for t-BDFI/H(2)O(2) system, and the corresponding detection limits are 1.2×10(-9) mol/L and 1.1×10(-9) mol/L, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of Co(2+) in vitamin B(12) injection. Furthermore, the CL mechanism was also discussed.((PMID:21779381))Migraine is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both migraine and CVD are highly heritable. However, the genetic liability for CVD among migraineurs is unclear.We performed a genome-wide association study for incident CVD events during 12 years of follow-up among 5,122 migraineurs participating in the population-based Women's Genome Health Study. Migraine was self-reported and CVD events were confirmed after medical records review. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and considered a genome-wide p-value <5×10(-8) as significant.Among the 5,122 women with migraine 164 incident CVD events occurred during follow-up. No SNP was associated with major CVD, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or CVD death at the genome-wide level; however, five SNPs showed association with p<5×10(-6). Among migraineurs with aura rs7698623 in MEPE (OR = 6.37; 95% CI 3.15-12.90; p = 2.7×10(-7)) and rs4975709 in IRX4 (OR = 5.06; 95% CI 2.66-9.62; p = 7.7×10(-7)) appeared to be associated with ischemic stroke, rs2143678 located close to MDF1 with major CVD (OR = 3.05; 95% CI 1.98-4.69; p = 4.3×10(-7)), and the intergenic rs1406961 with CVD death (OR = 12.33; 95% CI 4.62-32.87; p = 5.2×10(-7)). Further, rs1047964 in BACE1 appeared to be associated with CVD death among women with any migraine (OR = 4.67; 95% CI 2.53-8.62; p = 8.0×10(-7)).Our results provide some suggestion for an association of five SNPs with CVD events among women with migraine; none of the results was genome-wide significant. Four associations appeared among migraineurs with aura, two of those with ischemic stroke. Although our population is among the largest with migraine and incident CVD information, these results must be treated with caution, given the limited number of CVD events among women with migraine and the low minor allele frequencies for three of the SNPs. Our results await independent replication and should be considered hypothesis generating for future research.((PMID:21664411))The I-mfa domain proteins I-mfa and HIC are considered to be candidate tumor suppressor genes and have been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation. We show here that I-mfa and HIC specifically interact with SEI-1 through their C-terminal I-mfa domains in vivo. This interaction affects the intracellular localization of I-mfa and requires the region of SEI-1 between 30 and 90 amino acids, which includes its SERTA domain, and results in repression of its intrinsic transcriptional activity. I-mfa also decreases the levels of the SEI-1·DP-1 complex and endogenous Fbxw7 mRNA, the expression of which is coregulated by E2F·DP-1 and SEI-1 in an interaction-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, I-mfa also specifically interacts with other SERTA domain-containing proteins, including SEI-2, SEI-3, SERTAD3 and SERTAD4, through its I-mfa domain in vivo. This interaction also affects the intracellular localization of I-mfa and represses the intrinsic transcriptional activities of SEI-2 and SERTAD3, which are also involved in the E2F-dependent transcription. These data reveal for the first time that I-mfa domain proteins interact with SERTA domain proteins and negatively regulate their transcriptional activity. Because SEI-1, SEI-2 and SERTAD3, whose intrinsic transcriptional activities are repressed by I-mfa, are suggested to be oncogenes, I-mfa domain proteins may be involved in their oncogenic functions by negatively regulating their transcriptional activities.((PMID:18791226))The auxiliary spliceosomal protein SCNM1 contributes to recognition of nonconsensus splice donor sites. SCNM1 was first identified as a modifier of the severity of a sodium channelopathy in the mouse. The most severely affected strain, C57BL/6J, carries the variant allele SCNM1R187X, which is defective in splicing the mutated donor site in the Scn8a(medJ) transcript. To further probe the in vivo function of SCNM1, we constructed a floxed allele and generated a mouse with constitutive deletion of exons 3-5. The SCNM1Delta3-5 protein is produced and correctly localized to the nucleus, but is more functionally impaired than the C57BL/6J allele. Deficiency of SCNM1 did not significantly alter other brain transcripts. We characterized an ENU-induced allele of Scnm1 and evaluated the ability of wild-type SCNM1 to rescue lethal mutations of I-mfa and Brunol4. The phenotypes of the Scnm1Delta3-5 mutant confirm the role of this splice factor in processing the Scn8a(medJ) transcript and provide a new allele of greater severity for future studies.((PMID:18535405))Many genes undergo aberrant methylation in human cancers, and microarray platforms enable more comprehensive profiling of aberrant DNA methylation patterns.1,010 of 87,922 probes on the 88 K promoter array (606 genes) had a higher signal (log(2) > 2) in the pancreatic cancer line, Panc-1 compared to the non-neoplastic pancreatic duct line, HPDE. Using this cut-off, bisulfite sequencing and/or MSP confirmed differential methylation of all 27 genes (66 probes) predicted to be methylated by the MCA array. More than 1/2 of the genes aberrantly hypermethylated in Panc-1 were not expressed in the pancreatic duct (HPDE) by expression array analysis. Using the 244 K CpG island array, 1,968 CpG islands were differentially methylated in MiaPaca2 compared to normal pancreas. The MCA method was more likely to identify hypermethylation within CpG islands than a cocktail of methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. DNA methylation profiles using 10 ng of DNA were highly correlated with those obtained using 5 ug of DNA (R2 = 0.98). Analysis of 57 pancreatic cancers and 34 normal pancreata using MSP identified MDFI, hsa-miR-9-1, ZNF415, CNTNAP2 and ELOVL4 as methylated in 96%, 89%, 86%, 82% and 68% of the cancers vs. 9%, 15%, 6%, 3% and 97% of normal pancreata, respectively.We used methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) and Agilent promoter and CpG island microarrays to identify differential DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic cancer vs. normal pancreas. We examined MCA array reproducibility, compared it to methylation profiles obtained using a cocktail of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and examined gene expression of methylated genes.Promoter and CpG island array analysis finds aberrant methylation of hundreds of promoters and CpG islands in pancreatic cancer cells.((PMID:18388480))A commercial chromogenic agar medium (DFI) was supplemented with glucose (mDFI) to enhance the specificity of Enterobacter sakazakii (E. sakazakii) detection. Escherichia vulneris (E. vulneris), a putative false-positive strain on the DFI medium, produces alpha-glucosidase. The enzyme alpha- glucosidase hydrolyzes a substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3- indolyl-alpha,D-glucopyranoside (XalphaGlc), producing green colonies. E. sakazakii strains produced green colonies on both DFI and mDFI agar, whereas E. vulneris produced green colonies on DFI agar but small white colonies on mDFI agar. E. sakazakii and E. vulneris were also readily differentiated by colony color when the mixed culture of the two strains was plated on mDFI agar and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The results indicate that the selectivity of the commercial chromogenic agar medium could be improved by a simple supplementation with glucose.((PMID:19666247))The toxic hepatitis is the most common manifestation of acute liver disease in patient with alcohol. In these patients the discriminatory function index (DFI) > 32, has been associated with a mortality rate of up to 50%. MELD is a scale that has been recently validated as independent risk factors for death in patients who are candidates for liver transplantation.To compare the usefulness in mortality score vs. MELD. Maddrey index of discrimination in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and analyze the factors in a cohort Mexican prognosis.We evaluated the usefulness of MELD, compared with the index of discrimination Maddrey so retrospective in 67 hospitalized patients with alcoholic hepatitis in the Hospital Juárez in Mexico.The c-statistic for mDFI was 0.69 (CI 0.56-0.82) and to MELD was 0.73 (CI 0.61-0.86), sensitivity and specificity of DFI > 32 in 7 days to predict mortality was 100 and 7.1% , Respectively, and to meld > 21 sensitivity was 96% and specificity of 9.5%. The presence of encephalopathy > grade 2 and creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL was independent predictors of mortality.MELD > 21 calculated on admission, is equally useful for the mDFI for predicting mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis in the first week.((PMID:18316399))Wnt regulation of muscle development is thought to be mediated by the beta-catenin-TCF/LEF-dependent canonical pathway. Here we demonstrate that beta-catenin, not TCF/LEF, is required for muscle differentiation. We showed that beta-catenin interacts directly with MyoD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor essential for muscle differentiation and enhances its binding to E box elements and transcriptional activity. MyoD-mediated transactivation is inhibited in muscle cells when beta-catenin is deficient or the interaction between MyoD and beta-catenin is disrupted. These results demonstrate that beta-catenin is necessary for MyoD function, identifying MyoD as an effector in the Wnt canonical pathway.((PMID:17891141))The bHLH transcription factor Hand1 is essential for placentation and cardiac morphogenesis in the developing embryo. Here we implicate Hand1 as a molecular switch that determines whether a trophoblast stem cell continues to proliferate or commits to differentiation. We identify a novel interaction of Hand1 with a protein that contains an I-mfa (inhibitor of myogenic factor) domain that anchors Hand1 in the nucleolus where it negatively regulates Hand1 activity. In the trophoblast stem-cell line Rcho-1, nucleolar sequestration of Hand1 accompanies sustained cell proliferation and renewal, whereas release of Hand1 into the nucleus leads to its activation, thus committing cells to a differentiated giant-cell fate. Site-specific phosphorylation is required for nucleolar release of Hand1, for its dimerization and biological function, and this is mediated by the non-canonical polo-like kinase Plk4 (Sak). Sak is co-expressed in Rcho-1 cells, localizes to the nucleolus during G2 and phosphorylates Hand1 as a requirement for trophoblast stem-cell commitment to a giant-cell fate. This study defines a novel cellular mechanism for regulating Hand1 that is a crucial step in the stem-cell differentiation pathway.((PMID:17289077))Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complexes, composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1 or T2, are engaged by many cellular transcription regulators that activate or inhibit transcription from specific promoters. The related I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family a) and HIC (human I-mfa-domain-containing) proteins function in myogenic differentiation and embryonic development by participating in the Wnt signaling pathway. We report that I-mfa is a novel regulator of P-TEFb. Both HIC and I-mfa interact through their homologous I-mfa domains with cyclin T1 and T2 at two binding sites. One site is the regulatory histidine-rich domain that interacts with CDK9 substrates including RNA polymerase II. The second site contains a lysine and arginine-rich motif that is highly conserved between the two T cyclins. This site overlaps and includes the previously identified Tat/TAR recognition motif of cyclin T1 required for activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription. HIC and I-mfa can serve as substrates for P-TEFb. Their I-mfa domains also bind the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and inhibit Tat- and P-TEFb-dependent transcription from the HIV-1 promoter. This transcriptional repression is cell-type specific and can operate via Tat and cyclin T1. Genomic and sequence comparisons indicate that the I-mf and HIC genes, as well as flanking genes, diverged from a duplicated chromosomal region. Our findings link I-mfa and HIC to viral replication, and suggest that P-TEFb is modulated in the Wnt signaling pathway.((PMID:27664381))The aim of our study was to characterize the immediate phenotypic and adaptive regulatory responses of fetuses to different in utero conditions reflecting inadequate maternal protein supply during gestation. The gilts fed high- (250% above control) or low- (50% under control) protein diets isoenergetically adjusted at the expense of carbohydrates from the day of insemination until the fetuses were collected at day 64 or 94 of gestation. We analyzed body composition, histomorphology, biochemistry, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of fetal skeletal muscle. Both diets had only marginal effects on body composition and muscular cellularity of fetuses including an unchanged total number of myofibers. However, mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MYOG, MRF4, P ≤ 0.1), IGF system (IGF1, IGF1R, P ≤ 0.05) and myostatin antagonist FST (P = 0.6, in males only) was reduced in the fetal muscle exposed to a maternal low-protein diet. As a result of excess protein, MYOD, MYOG, IGF1R, and IGFBP5 mRNA expression (P ≤ 0.05) was upregulated in fetal muscle. Differences in muscular mRNA expression indicate in utero regulatory adaptive responses to maternal diet. Modulation of gene expression immediately contributes to the maintenance of an appropriate fetal phenotype that would be similar to that observed in the control fetuses. Moreover, we suggest that the modified gene expression in fetal skeletal muscle can be viewed as the origin of developmental muscular plasticity involved in the concept of fetal programming.((PMID:27662091))Mammalian DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression networks in many biological processes. However, investigation of the functions of specific methylation events remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that fusion of Tet1 or Dnmt3a with a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) enables targeted DNA methylation editing. Targeting of the dCas9-Tet1 or -Dnmt3a fusion protein to methylated or unmethylated promoter sequences caused activation or silencing, respectively, of an endogenous reporter. Targeted demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV or the MyoD distal enhancer by dCas9-Tet1 induced BDNF expression in post-mitotic neurons or activated MyoD facilitating reprogramming of fibroblasts into myoblasts, respectively. Targeted de novo methylation of a CTCF loop anchor site by dCas9-Dnmt3a blocked CTCF binding and interfered with DNA looping, causing altered gene expression in the neighboring loop. Finally, we show that these tools can edit DNA methylation in mice, demonstrating their wide utility for functional studies of epigenetic regulation.((PMID:27661449))PAS domain containing protein kinase (Pask) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase implicated in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation across eukaryotic species. We now describe an unexpected role of Pask in promoting the differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and adipogenic progenitor cells. This function of Pask is dependent upon its ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a member of several protein complexes including those that catalyze histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during transcriptional activation. Our findings suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, Pask stimulates the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 to activating H3K4me3 marks on the promoter of the differentiation gene myogenin (Myog) via Wdr5 phosphorylation. This enhances accessibility of the MyoD transcription factor and enables transcriptional activation of the Myog promoter to initiate muscle differentiation. Thus, as an upstream kinase of Wdr5, Pask integrates signaling cues with the transcriptional network to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells.((PMID:27661135))Muscle development, or myogenesis, is a highly regulated, complex process. A subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators of myogenesis. Recently, miR-378a was found to be involved in myogenesis, but the mechanism of how miR-378a regulates the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts has not been determined. We found that miR-378a-3p expression in muscle was significantly higher than in other tissues, suggesting an important effect on muscle development. Overexpression of miR-378a-3p increased the expression of MyoD and MHC in C2C12 myoblasts both at the level of mRNA and protein, confirming that miR-378a-3p promoted muscle cell differentiation. The forced expression of miR-378a-3p promoted apoptosis of C2C12 cells as evidenced by CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining results. Through TargetScan, histone acetylation enzyme 4 (HDAC4) was identified as a potential target of miR-378a-3p. We confirmed targeting of HDAC4 by miR-378a-3p using a dual luciferase assay and western blotting. Our RNAi analysis results also showed that HDAC4 significantly promoted differentiation of C2C12 cells and inhibited cell survival through Bcl-2. Therefore, we conclude that miR-378a-3p regulates skeletal muscle growth and promotes the differentiation of myoblasts through the post-transcriptional down-regulation of HDAC4.((PMID:27651888))Cellular models of muscle disease are taking on increasing importance with the large number of genes and mutations implicated in causing myopathies and the concomitant need to test personalized therapies. Developing cell models relies on having an easily obtained source of cells, and if the cells are not derived from muscle itself, a robust reprogramming process is needed. Fibroblasts are a human cell source that works well for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated into cardiomyocyte lineages, and with less efficiency, skeletal muscle-like lineages. Alternatively, direct reprogramming with the transcription factor MyoD has been used to generate myotubes from cultured human fibroblasts. Although useful, fibroblasts require a skin biopsy to obtain and this can limit their access, especially from pediatric populations.We now demonstrate that direct reprogramming of urine-derived cells is a highly efficient and reproducible process that can be used to establish human myogenic cells. We show that this method can be applied to urine cells derived from normal individuals as well as those with muscle diseases. Furthermore, we show that urine-derived cells can be edited using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.With progress in understanding the molecular etiology of human muscle diseases, having a readily available, noninvasive source of cells from which to generate muscle-like cells is highly useful.((PMID:27641238))Recent evidence suggests that autophagy and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway regulate skeletal muscle growth and bone formation in aged rats. However, the effect of downhill running on muscle growth and bone formation is not well understood. Thus, we investigated the effect of downhill and uphill running on age-related muscle and bone weakness. Young and late middle-aged rats were randomly assigned to control groups; young (YC) and late middle-aged (LMC), and two types of running training groups: late middle-aged downhill (LMD) and late middle-aged uphill (LMU). Training was progressively carried out on a treadmill at a speed of 21 m/min with a slope of +10° for uphill training vs 16 m/min with a slope of -16° for downhill training: 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 8 weeks respectively. Downhill and uphill training increased the autophagy-related proteins 5 (ATG5), microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3-Ⅱ), Beclin-1, and p62 proteins in aged rats. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SODs), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) signaling pathway were also elevated. Phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and myogenic differentiation (MyoD) were increased significantly in LMD and LMU groups. Consequently in the femur, BMP-2, -7 and autophagy molecules were expressed highly in LMD and LMU groups. These results suggest that both of the downhill and uphill training appeared to positively affect autophagy molecules and BMPs expression, respectively. Particularly, these physiological adaptations from gradual downhill training have an effect on bone morphological changes and muscle quality similar to gradual uphill training interventions in aging.

In this study, a new cell-laden scaffold was developed that supplies micro/nano-topological cues and promotes efficient release of cells. The hierarchical structure consisted of poly(ε-caprolactone) macrosized struts for sustaining a three-dimensional structural shape, aligned nanofibers obtained with optimized electrospinning, and cell-printed myoblasts. Importantly, the printed myoblasts were fully safe and were efficiently released from the cell-laden struts to neighboring nanofiber networks. The incorporation of micro/nanofibers in the hierarchical scaffold significantly affected myoblast proliferation, alignment, and even facilitated the formation of myotubes. We observed that myosin heavy chain expression and the expression levels of various myogenic genes (MyoD, myogenin, and troponin T) were significantly affected by the fiber alignment achieved in our hierarchical cell-laden structure. We believe that the combination of cell-printing and a hierarchical scaffold that encourages fiber alignment is a highly promising technique for skeletal muscle tissue engineering.((PMID:27628322))Postnatal skeletal muscle growth results from the activation of satellite cells and/or an increase in protein synthesis. The Notch signalling pathway maintains satellite cells in a quiescent state, and once activated, sustains their proliferation and commitment towards differentiation. In mammals, POFUT1-mediated O-fucosylation regulates the interactions between NOTCH receptors and ligands of the DELTA/JAGGED family, thus initiating the activation of canonical Notch signalling. Here, we analysed the consequences of downregulated expression of the Pofut1 gene on postnatal muscle growth in mutant Pofut1(cax/cax) (cax, compact axial skeleton) mice and differentiation of their satellite cell-derived myoblasts (SCDMs). Pofut1(cax/cax) mice exhibited muscle hypertrophy, no hyperplasia and a decrease in satellite cell numbers compared with wild-type C3H mice. In agreement with these observations, Pofut1(cax/cax) SCDMs differentiated earlier concomitant with reduced Pax7 expression and decrease in PAX7(+)/MYOD(-) progenitor cells. In vitro binding assays showed a reduced interaction of DELTA-LIKE 1 ligand (DLL1) with NOTCH receptors expressed at the cell surface of SCDMs, leading to a decreased Notch signalling as seen by the quantification of cleaved NICD and Notch target genes. These results demonstrated that POFUT1-mediated O-fucosylation of NOTCH receptors regulates myogenic cell differentiation and affects postnatal muscle growth in mice.((PMID:27611768))The cdk inhibitor p57(kip2), encoded by the Cdkn1c gene, plays a critical role in mammalian development and in the differentiation of several tissues. Cdkn1c protein levels are carefully regulated via imprinting and other epigenetic mechanisms affecting both the promoter and distant regulatory elements, which restrict its expression to particular developmental phases or specific cell types. Inappropriate activation of these regulatory mechanisms leads to Cdkn1c silencing, causing growth disorders and cancer. We have previously reported that, in skeletal muscle cells, induction of Cdkn1c expression requires the binding of the bHLH myogenic factor MyoD to a long-distance regulatory element within the imprinting control region KvDMR1. Interestingly, MyoD binding to KvDMR1 is prevented in myogenic cell types refractory to the induction of Cdkn1c. In the present work, we took advantage of this model system to investigate the epigenetic determinants of the differential interaction of MyoD with KvDMR1. We show that treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine restores the binding of MyoD to KvDMR1 in cells refractory to Cdkn1c induction. This, in turn, promotes the release of a repressive chromatin loop between KvDMR1 and Cdkn1c promoter and, thus, the upregulation of the gene. Analysis of the chromatin status of Cdkn1c promoter and KvDMR1 in two cell types showed that their differential responsiveness to the MyoD-dependent induction of the gene does not involve just their methylation status but, rather, the differential H3 lysine 9 dimethylation at KvDMR1. Finally, we report that the same histone modification also marks the KvDMR1 region of human cancer cells in which Cdkn1c is silenced. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the epigenetic status of KvDMR1 represents a critical determinant of the cell type-restricted expression of Cdkn1c and, possibly, of its aberrant silencing in some pathological conditions.((PMID:27610551))The purpose of this paper was to study the effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway on reloading-mediated restoration of disuse muscle loss induced by hind limb suspension in rats.Rats were divided into 4 groups: control group (CON), HLS group (hind limb suspension for 2 weeks), HLS + R group (hind limb suspension for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of natural reloading), and HRS + E group (hind limb suspension for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of treadmill exercise). Body weight, and weight and protein concentration of gastrocnemius were determined. The expression of members of canonical and noncanonical TGFβ signaling pathways, including TGFβ1, myostatin (MSTN), phospho-smad2/3, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38, JNK1/2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 [ERK1]/ERK2), as well as the corresponding downstream effectors of muscle mass-p21, Pax7, MyoD, and MyoG-was determined at protein or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels.Reloading increased MyoD mRNA and restored the decreased gastrocnemius weight/body weight ratio, protein concentration of gastrocnemius, phospho-ERK2, Pax7 and the increased TGFβ1, MSTN, phospho-smad2/3, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK1/2, and p21 induced by hind limb suspension. Moreover, the effects of exercise reloading on the restoration of gastrocnemius weight/body weight ratio, TGFβ1, MSTN, phospho-smad2, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK2, Pax7, as well as the induction of MyoD mRNA were stronger than those of natural reloading.Disuse muscle loss can be recovered by reloading in an intensity-dependent manner through canonical and noncanonical TGFβ signaling pathways. Pax7 and MyoD might be the effectors of TGFβ pathway in mediating the recovery effect of reloading.((PMID:27586271))Transfection with in vitro transcribed mRNAs is a safe and effective tool to convert somatic cells to any cell type of interest. One caveat of mRNA transfection is that mRNAs are recognized by multiple RNA-sensing toll like receptors (TLRs). These TLRs can both promote and inhibit cellular reprogramming. We demonstrated that mRNA transfection stimulated TLR3 and TLR7 and induced cytotoxicity and IFN-β expression in human and mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, mRNA transfection induced paracrine inhibition of repeated mRNA transfection through type I IFNs. Modified mRNAs (mmRNAs) containing pseudouridine and 5-methycytosine reduced TLR stimulation, cytotoxicity and IFN-β expression in fibroblasts. Repeated liposomal transfection with MyoD mmRNAs significantly enhanced myogenic conversion of human and mouse fibroblasts compared with repeated transfection with MyoD mRNAs. Interestingly, electroporation of mRNAs and mmRNAs completely abrogated cytotoxicity and IFN-β expression and also abolished myogenic conversion of fibroblasts. At a low concentration, TLR7/8 agonist R848 enhanced MyoD mmRNA-driven conversion of human fibroblasts into skeletal muscle cells, whereas high concentrations of R848 inhibited myogenic conversion of fibroblasts. Our study suggests that deliberate control of TLR signaling is a key factor in the success of mRNA-driven cellular reprogramming.((PMID:27583449))The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flavonoid quercetin (3,3´,4´,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) in a mice model of intense acute swimming-induced muscle pain, which resembles delayed onset muscle soreness. Quercetin intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment dose-dependently reduced muscle mechanical hyperalgesia. Quercetin inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-β-D- glucosaminidase (NAG) activities, cytokine production, oxidative stress, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and gp91phox mRNA expression and muscle injury (creatinine kinase [CK] blood levels and myoblast determination protein [MyoD] mRNA expression) as well as inhibited NFκB activation and induced Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA expression in the soleus muscle. Beyond inhibiting those peripheral effects, quercetin also inhibited spinal cord cytokine production, oxidative stress and glial cells activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [Iba-1] mRNA expression). Concluding, the present data demonstrate that quercetin is a potential molecule for the treatment of muscle pain conditions related to unaccustomed exercise.((PMID:27573543))Muscle regeneration is a coordinated process that involves proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. Activation of MyoD is a key event in myogenic differentiation, which is regulated by p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPK). In a screen of natural compounds for the enhancement of MyoD activity, dehydrocorydaline (DHC) from the Corydalis tuber was identified. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with DHC increased the expression levels of muscle‑specific proteins, including MyoD, myogenin and myosin heavy chain. In addition, C2C12 myoblasts exhibited enhanced multinucleated myotube formation without any cytotoxicity. Treatment with DHC elevated p38 MAPK activation and the interaction of MyoD with an E protein, which is likely to result in activation of MyoD and promotion of myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, defects in differentiation‑induced p38 MAPK activation and myoblast differentiation induced by depletion of the promyogenic receptor protein Cdo in C2C12 myoblasts were restored by DHC treatment. In conclusion, these results indicated that DHC stimulates p38 MAPK activation, which can enhance heterodimerization of MyoD and E proteins, thus resulting in MyoD activation and myoblast differentiation. These findings suggested that DHC may be considered a potential therapeutic compound for the improvement of muscle stem cell regenerative capacity in injured muscle.((PMID:27570911))Skeletal muscle is capable of robust self-repair following mild trauma, yet in cases of traumatic volumetric muscle loss (VML), where more than 20% of a muscle's mass is lost, this capacity is overwhelmed. Current autogenic whole muscle transfer techniques are imperfect, which has motivated the exploration of implantable scaffolding strategies. In this study, the use of an allogeneic decellularized skeletal muscle (DSM) scaffold with and without the addition of minced muscle (MM) autograft tissue was explored as a repair strategy using a lower-limb VML injury model (n = 8/sample group). We found that the repair of VML injuries using DSM + MM scaffolds significantly increased recovery of peak contractile force (81 ± 3% of normal contralateral muscle) compared to unrepaired VML controls (62 ± 4%). Similar significant improvements were measured for restoration of muscle mass (88 ± 3%) in response to DSM + MM repair compared to unrepaired VML controls (79 ± 3%). Histological findings revealed a marked decrease in collagen dense repair tissue formation both at and away from the implant site for DSM + MM repaired muscles. The addition of MM to DSM significantly increased MyoD expression, compared to isolated DSM treatment (21-fold increase) and unrepaired VML (37-fold) controls. These findings support the further exploration of both DSM and MM as promising strategies for the repair of VML injury.((PMID:27569217))Current therapeutic options for the pediatric cancer rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have not improved significantly, especially for metastatic RMS. In the present work, we performed a deep microRNA profiling of the three major human RMS subtypes, along with cell lines and normal muscle, to identify novel molecular circuits with therapeutic potential. The signature we determined could discriminate RMS from muscle, revealing a subset of muscle-enriched microRNA (myomiR), including miR-22 which was strongly underexpressed in tumors. miR-22 was physiologically induced during normal myogenic differentiation and was transcriptionally regulated by MyoD, confirming its identity as a myomiR. Once introduced into RMS cells, miR-22 decreased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, restoring miR-22 expression blocked tumor growth and prevented tumor dissemination in vivo. Gene expression profiling analysis of miR-22-expressing cells suggested TACC1 and RAB5B as possible direct miR-22 targets. Accordingly, loss and gain of function experiments defined the biological relevance of these genes in RMS pathogenesis. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of miR-22 to intercept and overcome the intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibition based on ERBB3 upregulation. Overall our results identified a novel miR-22 regulatory network with critical therapeutic implications in RMS.((PMID:27563828))In previous studies, we have reported that phospholipase C (PLC)-β1 plays a crucial role in myogenic differentiation and we determined the importance of its catalytic activity for the initiation of this process. Here we define the effectors that take part to its signaling pathway. We show that the Inositol Polyphosphate Multikinase (IPMK) is able to promote myogenic differentiation since its overexpression determines the up-regulation of several myogenic markers. Moreover, we demonstrate that IPMK activates the same cyclin D3 promoter region targeted by PLC-β1 and that IPMK-induced promoter activation relies upon c-jun binding to the promoter, as we have shown previously for PLC-β1. Furthermore, our data shows that IPMK overexpression causes an increase in β-catenin translocation and accumulation to the nuclei of differentiating myoblasts resulting in higher MyoD activation. Finally, we describe that PLC-β1 overexpression determines too an increase in β-catenin translocation and that PLC-β1, IPMK and β-catenin are mediators of the same signaling pathway since their overexpression results in cyclin D3 and myosin heavy chain (MYH) induction.((PMID:27556060))Pompe disease (PD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency. Progressive muscular weakness is the major symptom of PD, and enzyme replacement therapy can improve the clinical outcome. However, to achieve a better clinical outcome, alternative therapeutic strategies are being investigated, including gene therapy and pharmacological chaperones. We previously used lentiviral vector-mediated GAA gene transfer in PD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. Some therapeutic efficacy was observed, although glycogen accumulation was not normalized. Transcription factor EB is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy that has recently been associated with muscular pathology, and is now a potential therapeutic target in PD model mice. Here, we differentiated skeletal muscle from PD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells by forced MyoD expression. Lentiviral vector-mediated GAA and transcription factor EB gene transfer independently improved GAA enzyme activity and reduced glycogen content in skeletal muscle derived from PD-induced pluripotent stem cells. Interestingly, GAA and transcription factor EB cooperatively improved skeletal muscle pathology, both biochemically and morphologically. Thus, our findings show that abnormal lysosomal biogenesis is associated with the muscular pathology of PD, and transcription factor EB gene transfer is effective as an add-on strategy to GAA gene transfer.((PMID:27551368))Master transcription factor MyoD can initiate the entire myogenic gene expression program which differentiates proliferating myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. We previously demonstrated that histone methyltransferase KMT1A associates with and inhibits MyoD in proliferating myoblasts, and must be removed to allow differentiation to proceed. It is known that pro-myogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and p38α MAPK play critical roles in enforcing associations between MyoD and transcriptional activators, while removing repressors. However, the mechanism which displaces KMT1A from MyoD, and the signals responsible, remain unknown.To investigate the role of p38α on MyoD-mediated differentiation, we utilized C2C12 myoblast cells as an in vitro model. p38α activity was either augmented via overexpression of a constitutively active upstream kinase or blocked via lentiviral delivery of a specific p38α shRNA or treatment with p38α/β inhibitor SB203580. Overexpression of KMT1A in these cells via lentiviral delivery was also used as a system wherein terminal differentiation is impeded by high levels of KMT1A.The association of KMT1A and MyoD persisted, and differentiation was blocked in C2C12 myoblasts specifically after pharmacologic or genetic blockade of p38α. Conversely, forced activation of p38α was sufficient to activate MyoD and overcome the differentiation blockade in KMT1A-overexpressing C2C12 cells. Consistent with this finding, KMT1A phosphorylation during C2C12 differentiation correlated strongly with the activation of p38α. This phosphorylation was prevented by the inhibition of p38α. Biochemical studies further revealed that KMT1A can be a direct substrate for p38α. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies show that the removal of KMT1A-mediated transcription repressive histone tri-methylation (H3K9me3) from the promoter of the Myogenin gene, a critical regulator of muscle differentiation, is dependent on p38α activity in C2C12 cells. Elevated p38α activity was also sufficient to remove this repressive H3K9me3 mark. Moreover, ChIP studies from C2C12 cells show that p38α activity is necessary and sufficient to establish active H3K9 acetylation on the Myogenin promoter.Activation of p38α displaces KMT1A from MyoD to initiate myogenic gene expression upon induction of myoblasts differentiation.((PMID:27530229))A ready source of autologous myogenic cells is of vital importance for drug screening and functional genetic studies in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a rare disease caused by a variety of dystrophin gene mutations. As stem cells (SCs) can be easily and non-invasively obtained from urine specimens, we set out to determine whether they could be myogenic-induced and useful in DMD research. To this end, we isolated stem cells from the urine of two healthy donors and one patient with DMD, and performed surface-marker characterization, myogenic differentiation (MyoD), and then transfection with antisense oligoribonucletoides to test for exon skipping and protein restoration. We demonstrated that native urine-derived stem cells express the full-length dystrophin transcript, and that the dystrophin mutation was retained in DMD patient cells, although the dystrophin protein was detected solely in control cells following myogenic transformation according to the phenotype. Notably, we also showed that treatment with antisense oligoribonucleotide against dystrophin exon 44 induced skipping in both native and MyoD-transformed urine-derived stem cells in DMD, with a therapeutic transcript-reframing effect, as well as visible protein restoration in the latter. Hence MyoD-transformed cells may be a good myogenic model for studying dystrophin gene expression, and native urine stem cells could be used to study the dystrophin transcript, and both diagnostic procedures and splicing modulation therapies in both patients and controls, without invasive and costly collection methods. New, bankable bioproducts from urine stem cells, useful for pre-screening studies and therapeutic applications alike, are also foreseeable following further, more in-depth characterisation.((PMID:12514181))Helix-loop-helix (HLH) and helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (HLHZip) are dimerization domains that mediate selective pairing among members of a large transcription factor family involved in cell fate determination. To investigate the molecular rules underlying recognition specificity and to isolate molecules interfering with cell proliferation and differentiation control, we assembled two molecular repertoires obtained by directed randomization of the binding surface in these two domains. For this strategy we selected the Heb HLH and Max Zip regions as molecular scaffolds for the randomization process and displayed the two resulting molecular repertoires on lambda phage capsids. By affinity selection, many domains were isolated that bound to the proteins Mad, Rox, MyoD, and Id2 with different levels of affinity. Although several residues along an extended surface within each domain appeared to contribute to dimerization, some key residues critically involved in molecular recognition could be identified. Furthermore, a number of charged residues appeared to act as switch points facilitating partner exchange. By successfully selecting ligands for four of four HLH or HLHZip proteins, we have shown that the repertoires assembled are rather general and possibly contain elements that bind with sufficient affinity to any natural HLH or HLHZip molecule. Thus they represent a valuable source of ligands that could be used as reagents for molecular dissection of functional regulatory pathways.((PMID:27406318))Satellite cells are adult stem cells located between the basal lamina and sarcolemma of muscle fibers. Under physiological conditions, satellite cells are quiescent, but they maintain a strong proliferative potential and propensity to differentiate, which underlies their critical role in muscle preservation and growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles during animal development as well as in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation regulation. MiRNA-1, miRNA-133a and miRNA-206 are closely related muscle-specific miRNAs, and are thus defined myomiRNAs. MyomiRNAs are integrated into myogenic regulatory networks. Their expression is under the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of myogenic factors and, in turn, they exhibit widespread control of muscle gene expression. Very little information is available about the regulation and behavior of satellite cells in large farm animals, in particular during satellite cell differentiation. Here, we study bovine satellite cells (BoSCs) undergoing a differentiation process and report the expression pattern of selected genes and miRNAs involved. Muscle samples of longissimus thoracis from Holstein adult male animals were selected for the collection of satellite cells. All satellite cell preparations demonstrated myotube differentiation. To characterize the dynamics of several transcription factors expressed in BoSCs, we performed real-time PCR on complementary DNA generated from the total RNA extracted from BoSCs cultivated in growth medium (GM) or in differentiation medium (DM) for 4 days. In the GM condition, BoSCs expressed the satellite cell lineage markers as well as transcripts for the myogenic regulatory factors. At the time of isolation from muscle, PAX7 was expressed in nearly 100% of BoSCs; however, its messenger RNA (mRNA) levels dramatically decreased between 3 and 6 days post isolation (P<0.01). MyoD mRNA levels increased during the 1st day of cultivation in DM (day 7; P<0.02), showing a gradual activation of the myogenic gene program. During the subsequent 4 days of culture in DM, several tested genes, including MRF4, MYOG, MEF2C, TMEM8C, DES and MYH1, showed increased expression (P<0.05), and these levels remained high throughout the culture period investigated. Meanwhile, the expression of genes involved in the differentiation process also miRNA-1, miRNA-133a and miRNA-206 were strongly up-regulated on the 1st day in DM (day 7; P<0.05). Analysis revealed highly significant correlations between myomiRNAs expression and MEF2C, MRF4, TMEM8C, DES and MYH1 gene expression (P<0.001). Knowledge about the transcriptional changes correlating with the growth and differentiation of skeletal muscle fibers could be helpful for developing strategies to improve production performance in livestock.((PMID:27239431))We previously showed that Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) expression was induced when quiescent muscle satellite cells were stimulated by hepatocyte growth factor and became activated satellite cells (ASCs). However, how Sema3A regulates genes in the early phase of ASCs remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether Sema3A signaling can regulate the early phase of ASCs, an important satellite cell stage for postnatal growth, repair, and maintenance of skeletal muscle. We showed that expression of the myogenic proliferation regulatory factors Pax7 and Myf5 was decreased in myoblasts transfected with Sema3A siRNA. These cells failed to activate expression MyoD, another myogenic proliferation regulatory factor, during differentiation. Interestingly, some of the Sema3A-depleted cells did not express Pax7 and MyoD and had enlarged nuclei and very large cytoplasmic areas. We also observed that Pax7 and Myf5 expression was increased in Myc-Sema3A overexpressing myoblasts. BrdU analysis indicated that Sema3A regulated proliferation of ASCs. These findings suggest that Sema3A signaling can modulate expression of Pax7, Myf5, and MyoD. Moreover, we found that expression of emerin, an inner nuclear membrane protein, was regulated by Sema3A signaling. Emerin was identified by positional cloning as the gene responsible for the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (X-EDMD). In conclusion, our results support a role for Sema3A in maintaining ASCs through regulation, via emerin, of Pax7, Myf5, and MyoD expression.((PMID:27104590))The Peg3 (Paternally Expressed Gene 3) imprinted domain is predicted to be regulated through a large number of evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) that are localized within its middle 200-kb region. In the current study, we characterized these potential cis-regulatory regions using phylogenetic and epigenetic approaches. According to the results, the majority of these ECRs are potential enhancers for the transcription of the Peg3 domain. Also, these potential enhancers can be divided into two groups based on their histone modification and DNA methylation patterns: ubiquitous and tissue-specific enhancers. Phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses further revealed that several cis-regulatory motifs are frequently associated with the ECRs, such as the E box, PITX2, NF-κB and RFX1 motifs. A series of subsequent ChIP experiments demonstrated that the trans factor MYOD indeed binds to the E box of several ECRs, further suggesting that MYOD may play significant roles in the transcriptional control of the Peg3 domain. Overall, the current study identifies, for the first time, a set of cis-regulatory motifs and corresponding trans factors that may be critical for the transcriptional regulation of the Peg3 domain.((PMID:26854366))MicroRNAs are a class of 18-22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by associating with the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs. A large number of microRNAs are involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation, many of which remain undiscovered. In this study, we found that miR-143-3p was upregulated during C2C12 myoblast differentiation and over-expression of miR-143-3p significantly inhibited the relative expression levels of MyoD, MyoG, myf5, and MyHC genes, especially in the later stages of differentiation. In addition, miR-143-3p inhibited expression of genes involved in the endogenous Wnt signaling pathway during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, including Wnt5a, LRP5, Axin2, and β-catenin. These results indicate that miR-143-3p represents a new myogenic differentiation-associated microRNA that can inhibit C2C12 myoblast differentiation, especially in the later stages of differentiation.((PMID:26733463))Lethal fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) describes a clinically and genetically heterogeneous phenotype that includes fetal akinesia, intrauterine growth retardation, arthrogryposis and developmental anomalies. Affected babies die as a result of pulmonary hypoplasia. We aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of this disorder in a family in which there were three affected individuals from two sibships.Autosomal-recessive inheritance was suggested by a family history of consanguinity and by recurrence of the phenotype between the two sibships. We performed exome sequencing of the affected individuals and their unaffected mother, followed by autozygosity mapping and variant filtering to identify the causative gene.Five autozygous regions were identified, spanning 31.7 Mb of genomic sequence and including 211 genes. Using standard variant filtering criteria, we excluded all variants as being the likely pathogenic cause, apart from a single novel nonsense mutation, c.188C>A p.(Ser63*) (NM_002478.4), in MYOD1. This gene encodes an extensively studied transcription factor involved in muscle development, which has nonetheless not hitherto been associated with a hereditary human disease phenotype.We provide the first description of a human phenotype that appears to result from MYOD1 mutation. The presentation with FADS is consistent with a large body of data demonstrating that in the mouse, MyoD is a major controller of precursor cell commitment to the myogenic differentiation programme.((PMID:26501226))Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (ScRMS) and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (SRMS) have been recently reclassified as a stand-alone pathologic entity, separate from embryonal RMS. Genetically, a subset of the congenital cases display NCOA2 gene rearrangements, whereas tumors occurring in older children or adults harbor MYOD1 gene mutations with or without coexisting PIK3CA mutations. Despite these recent advances, a significant number of tumors lack known genetic alterations. In this study we sought to investigate a large group of pediatric SRMS/ScRMS, spanning a diverse clinical and pathologic spectrum, by using a combined fluorescence in situ hybridization, targeted DNA, and whole-transcriptome sequencing methodology for a more definitive molecular classification. A total of 26 SRMS and ScRMS cases were selected from the 2 participating institutions for the molecular analysis. Ten of the 11 congenital/infantile SRMS showed recurrent fusion genes: with novel VGLL2 rearrangements seen in 7 (63%), including VGLL2-CITED2 fusion in 4 and VGLL2-NCOA2 in 2 cases. Three (27%) cases harbored the previously described NCOA2 gene fusions, including TEAD1-NCOA2 in 2 and SRF-NCOA2 in 1. All fusion-positive congenital/infantile SRMS patients with available long-term follow-up were alive and well, none developing distant metastases. Among the remaining 15 SRMS patients older than 1 year, 10 (67%) showed MYOD1 L122R mutations, most of them following a fatal outcome despite an aggressive multimodality treatment. All 4 cases harboring coexisting MYOD1/PIK3CA mutations shared sclerosing morphology. All 5 fusion/mutation-negative SRMS cases presented as intra-abdominal or paratesticular lesions.((PMID:26387956))In polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, large polyQ repeats cause juvenile cases with different symptoms than those of adult-onset patients, who carry smaller expanded polyQ repeats. The mechanisms behind the differential pathology mediated by different polyQ repeat lengths remain unknown. By studying knockin mouse models of spinal cerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17), we found that a large polyQ (105 glutamines) in the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) preferentially causes muscle degeneration and reduces the expression of muscle-specific genes. Direct expression of TBP with different polyQ repeats in mouse muscle revealed that muscle degeneration is mediated only by the large polyQ repeats. Different polyQ repeats differentially alter TBP's interaction with neuronal and muscle-specific transcription factors. As a result, the large polyQ repeat decreases the association of MyoD with TBP and DNA promoters. Our findings suggest that specific alterations in protein interactions by large polyQ repeats may account for the unique pathology in juvenile polyQ diseases.((PMID:26029693))Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) possess unlimited proliferative potential while maintaining the ability to differentiate into any cell type including skeletal muscle cells (SMCs). hPSCs are amenable to genetic editing and can be derived from patient somatic cells, and thus represent a promising option for cell therapies for the treatment of degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophies. There are unresolved challenges however associated with the derivation and scale-up of hPSCs and generation of differentiated cells in large quantity and high purity. Reported myogenic differentiation protocols are long, require cell sorting and/or rely on ectopic expression of myogenic master regulators. More recent advances have been made with the application of small molecules to enhance the myogenic differentiation efficiency and the identification of more selective markers for the enrichment of myogenic progenitors with enhanced regenerative potential. Here we review the field of myogenic differentiation and highlight areas requiring further research.((PMID:25988569))Electrically conductive materials provide a suitable platform for the in vitro study of excitable cells, such as skeletal muscle cells, due to their inherent conductivity and electroactivity. Here it is demonstrated that bioinspired electroconductive nanopatterned substrates enhance myogenic differentiation and maturation. The topographical cues from the highly aligned collagen bundles that form the extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle tissue are mimicked using nanopatterns created with capillary force lithography. Electron beam deposition is then utilized to conformally coat nanopatterned substrates with a thin layer of either gold or titanium to create electroconductive substrates with well-defined, large-area nanotopographical features. C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line, are cultured for 7 d on substrates and the effects of topography and electrical conductivity on cellular morphology and myogenic differentiation are assessed. It is found that biomimetic nanotopography enhances the formation of aligned myotubes and the addition of an electroconductive coating promotes myogenic differentiation and maturation, as indicated by the upregulation of myogenic regulatory factors Myf5, MyoD, and myogenin (MyoG). These results suggest the suitability of electroconductive nanopatterned substrates as a biomimetic platform for the in vitro engineering of skeletal muscle tissue.((PMID:25800978))There is increasing evidence that WT1 protein expression is found not only at nuclear, but also at cytoplasmic, level in several developing and neoplastic tissues. In order to better understand the possible role of WT1 protein in human skeletal myogenesis and oncogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma, we assessed immunohistochemically its comparative expression in a large series of human developing, adult and neoplastic skeletal muscle tissues. The present study shows that WT1 protein is developmentally expressed in the cytoplasm of human myoblasts from the 6 weeks of gestational age. This expression was maintained in the myotubes of developing muscles of the trunk, head, neck, and extremities, while it was down-regulated in fetal skeletal fibers from 20 weeks of gestational age as well as in adult normal skeletal muscle. Notably, WT1 immunostaining disappeared from rhabdomyomas, whereas it was strongly and diffusely re-expressed in all cases (27/27) of embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The comparative evaluation of the immunohistochemical findings revealed that WT1 cytoplasmic expression in rhabdomyosarcoma may represent an ontogenetic reversal, and this nuclear transcription factor can also be considered an oncofetal protein which can be exploitable as an additional, highly sensitive immunomarker, together with desmin, myogenin and MyoD1, of this tumor. Moreover, our observations support the rationale for the use of WT1 protein-based target therapy in high risk rhabdomyosarcomas in children and adolescents.((PMID:25489948))Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), one of the seven mammalian sirtuins, is a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase known to control key metabolic pathways. SIRT3 deacetylases and activates a large number of mitochondrial enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, in ATP production, and in both the citric acid and urea cycles. We have previously shown that the regulation of myoblast differentiation is tightly linked to mitochondrial activity. Since SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial activity, we decide to address its role during myoblast differentiation. For this purpose, we first investigated the expression of endogenous SIRT3 during C2C12 myoblast differentiation. We further studied the impact of SIRT3 silencing on both the myogenic potential and the mitochondrial activity of C2C12 cells. We showed that SIRT3 protein expression peaked at the onset of myoblast differentiation. The inhibition of SIRT3 expression mediated by the stable integration of SIRT3 short inhibitory RNA (SIRT3shRNA) in C2C12 myoblasts, resulted in: 1) abrogation of terminal differentiation - as evidenced by a marked decrease in the myoblast fusion index and a significant reduction of Myogenin, MyoD, Sirtuin 1 and Troponin T protein expression - restored upon MyoD overexpression; 2) a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and citrate synthase protein expression reflecting an alteration of mitochondrial density; and 3) an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mirrored by the decreased activity of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Altogether our data demonstrate that SIRT3 mainly regulates myoblast differentiation via its influence on mitochondrial activity.((PMID:25480916))Muscle satellite cells are indispensable for muscle regeneration, but the functional diversity of their daughter cells is unknown. Here, we show that many Pax7(+)MyoD(-) cells locate both beneath and outside the basal lamina during myofiber maturation. A large majority of these Pax7(+)MyoD(-) cells are not self-renewed satellite cells, but have different potentials for both proliferation and differentiation from Pax7(+)MyoD(+) myoblasts (classical daughter cells), and are specifically marked by expression of the doublecortin (Dcx) gene. Transplantation and lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that Dcx-expressing cells originate from quiescent satellite cells and that the microenvironment induces Dcx in myoblasts. Expression of Dcx seems to be necessary for myofiber maturation because Dcx-deficient mice exhibited impaired myofiber maturation resulting from a decrease in the number of myonuclei. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that one function of Dcx in myogenic cells is acceleration of cell motility. These results indicate that Dcx is a new marker for the Pax7(+)MyoD(-) subpopulation, which contributes to myofiber maturation during muscle regeneration.((PMID:25377122))Success of meat production and selection for improvement of meat quality is among the primary aims in animal production. Meat quality traits are economically important in swine; however, the underlying genetic nature is very complex. Therefore, an improved pork production strongly depends on identifying and studying how genetic variations contribute to modulate gene expression. Promoters are key regions in gene modulation as they harbour several binding motifs to transcription regulatory factors. Therefore, polymorphisms in these regions are likely to deeply affect RNA levels and consequently protein synthesis. In this study, we report the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter regions of candidate genes involved in development, cellular differentiation and muscle growth in Sus scrofa. We identified SNPs in the promoter regions of genes belonging to the Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRF) gene family (the Myogenic Differentiation gene, MYOD1) and to Growth and Differentiation Factors (GDF) gene family (Myostatin gene, MSTN, GDF8), in Casertana and Large White breeds. The purpose of this study was to investigate if polymorphisms in the promoters could affect the transcriptional activity of these genes. With this aim, we evaluated in vitro the functional activity of the luciferase reporter gene luc2 activity, driven by two constructs carrying different promoter haplotypes.We tested the effects of the G302A (U12574) transition on the promoter efficiency in MYOD1 gene. We ascertained a difference in transcription efficiency for the two variants. A stronger activity of the A-carrying construct is more evident in C2C12. The luciferase expression driven by the MYOD1-A allelic variant displayed a 3.8-fold increased transcriptional activity. We investigated the activity of two haplotype variants (AY527152) in the promoter of GDF8 gene. The haploptype-1 (A435-A447-A879) up-regulated the expression of the reporter gene by a two-fold increase, and hence presumably of the GDF8 gene, in both CHO and C2C12 cultured cells.In vitro the MYOD1-A allelic variant could up-regulate the expression of MYOD1 gene. Additionally, we could assess a different response of in vitro gene expression according to cell type used to transfect constructs, suggesting that MyoD activation is regulated by mechanisms that are specific of myoblasts.((PMID:25364710))Adult skeletal muscle possesses extraordinary regeneration capacities. After muscle injury or exercise, large numbers of newly formed muscle fibers are generated within a week as a result of expansion and differentiation of a self-renewing pool of muscle stem cells termed muscle satellite cells. Normally, satellite cells are mitotically quiescent and reside beneath the basal lamina of muscle fibers. Upon regeneration, satellite cells are activated, and give rise to daughter myogenic precursor cells. After several rounds of proliferation, these myogenic precursor cells contribute to the formation of new muscle fibers. During cell division, a minor population of myogenic precursor cells returns to quiescent satellite cells as a self-renewal process. Currently, accumulating evidence has revealed the essential roles of satellite cells in muscle regeneration and the regulatory mechanisms, while it still remains to be elucidated how satellite cell self-renewal is molecularly regulated and how satellite cells are important in aging and diseased muscle. The number of satellite cells is decreased due to the changing niche during ageing, resulting in attenuation of muscle regeneration capacity. Additionally, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, the loss of satellite cell regenerative capacity and decreased satellite cell number due to continuous needs for satellite cells lead to progressive muscle weakness with chronic degeneration. Thus, it is necessary to replenish muscle satellite cells continuously. This review outlines recent findings regarding satellite cell heterogeneity, asymmetric division and molecular mechanisms in satellite cell self-renewal which is crucial for maintenance of satellite cells as a muscle stem cell pool throughout life. In addition, we discuss roles in the stem cell niche for satellite cell maintenance, as well as related cell therapies for approaching treatment of DMD.((PMID:24972797))In vertebrates, muscles of the pectoral girdle connect the forelimbs with the thorax. During development, the myogenic precursor cells migrate from the somites into the limb buds. Whereas most of the myogenic precursors remain in the limb bud to form the forelimb muscles, several cells migrate back toward the trunk to give rise to the superficial pectoral girdle muscles, such as the large pectoral muscle, the latissimus dorsi and the deltoid. Recently, this developing mode has been referred to as the "In-Out" mechanism. The present study focuses on the mechanisms of the "In-Out" migration during formation of the pectoral girdle muscles. Combining in ovo electroporation, tissue slice-cultures and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we visualize live in detail the retrograde migration of myogenic precursors from the forelimb bud into the trunk region by live imaging. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence for the involvement of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1 during these processes. After microsurgical implantations of CXCR4 inhibitor beads in the proximal forelimb region of chicken embryos, we demonstrate with the aid of in situ hybridization and live-cell imaging that CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling is crucial for the retrograde migration of pectoral girdle muscle precursors. Moreover, we analyzed the MyoD expression in CXCR4-mutant mouse embryos and observed a considerable decrease in pectoral girdle musculature. We thus demonstrate the importance of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis for the pectoral girdle muscle formation in avians and mammals.((PMID:24963862))Muscular dystrophies comprise a large group of inherited disorders that lead to progressive muscle wasting. We wanted to investigate if targeting satellite cells can enhance muscle regeneration and thus increase muscle mass. We treated mice with hepatocyte growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor under three conditions: normoxia, hypoxia and during myostatin deficiency. We found that hepatocyte growth factor treatment led to activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K protein synthesis pathway, up-regulation of the myognic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin, and subsequently the negative growth control factor, myostatin and atrophy markers MAFbx and MuRF1. Hypoxia-induced atrophy was partially restored by hepatocyte growth factor combined with leukemia inhibitory factor treatment. Dividing satellite cells were three-fold increased in the treatment group compared to control. Finally, we demonstrated that myostatin regulates satellite cell activation and myogenesis in vivo following treatment, consistent with previous findings in vitro. Our results suggest, not only a novel in vivo pharmacological treatment directed specifically at activating the satellite cells, but also a myostatin dependent mechanism that may contribute to the progressive muscle wasting seen in severely affected patients with muscular dystrophy and significant on-going regeneration. This treatment could potentially be applied to many conditions that feature muscle wasting to increase muscle bulk and strength.((PMID:24949706))As the understanding of the nutritional regulation of muscle growth mechanisms in fish is fragmentary, the present study aimed to (1) characterise ontogenetic changes in muscle growth-related genes in parallel to changes in muscle cellularity; (2) determine whether an early decrease in dietary protein:energy ratio by fat addition affects the muscle growth mechanisms of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins; and (3) determine whether this early feeding of a high-fat (HF) diet to alevins had a long-term effect on muscle growth processes in juveniles fed a commercial diet. Developmental regulation of hyperplasia and hypertrophy was evidenced at the molecular (expression of myogenic regulatory factors, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and myosin heavy chains (MHC)) and cellular (number and diameter of white muscle fibres) levels. An early decrease in dietary protein:energy ratio by fat addition stimulated the body growth of alevins but led to a fatty phenotype, with accumulation of lipids in the anterior part, and less caudal muscle when compared at similar body weights, due to a decrease in both the white muscle hyperplasia and maximum hypertrophy of white muscle fibres. These HF diet-induced cellular changes were preceded by a very rapid down-regulation of the expression of fast-MHC. The present study also demonstrated that early dietary composition had a long-term effect on the subsequent muscle growth processes of juveniles fed a commercial diet for 3 months. When compared at similar body weights, initially HF diet-fed juveniles indeed had a lower mean diameter of white muscle fibres, a smaller number of large white muscle fibres, and lower expression levels of MyoD1 and myogenin. These findings demonstrated the strong effect of early feed composition on the muscle growth mechanisms of trout alevins and juveniles.((PMID:24462753))TCAP (also known as titin-cap or telethonin) is one of the titin interacting Z-disk proteins involved in the regulation and development of normal sarcomeric structure. In this study, we cloned the cDNA and promoter sequences of porcine TCAP gene, which contained a 504 bp full-length coding region. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that porcine TCAP was highly expressed in the skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney. During postnatal muscle development, TCAP expression was down-regulated from 30 days to 120 days in Large White and Meishan pigs. One single nucleotide polymorphism c.334 G>A in exon 2 of the TCAP gene was identified and detected by allele-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR). Association analysis revealed that the polymorphism had significant associations (P<0.05 and P<0.01) with some carcass traits. Analysis of the porcine TCAP promoter in different cell lines demonstrated that it is a muscle-specific promoter. In addition, we found that the porcine TCAP promoter can be activated by MyoD, MyoG and MEF2 in myotubes, which indicated that TCAP may play a role in the regulation of porcine skeletal muscle development. These findings provide useful information for the further investigation of the function of TCAP in porcine skeletal muscle.((PMID:22733692))Treadmill running is a commonly used training method for patients with spasticity to improve functional performance. Botulinum toxin has been widely used therapeutically to reduce contraction force of spastic muscle. However, the effects of treadmill running in neuromuscular junction expression and motor unit physiology on muscle following botulinum toxin injection are not well established. To assess the effects of treadmill running on neuromuscular recovery of gastrocnemius following botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection, we observed changes in gene expression. We hypothesized that the expression of acetylcholine receptor (AChR), myogenesis, and nerve plasticity could be enhanced. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats received botulinum toxin injection in right gastrocnemius and were then randomly assigned into untrained control and treadmill running groups. The rats assigned to the treadmill running group were trained on a treadmill 3 times/week with a running speed of 15 m/min for 8 weeks. The duration of training was 20 min per session. Muscle strength and gene expression of AChR subunit (α, β, δ, γ, and ε), MyoD, Myf-5, MRF4, myogenin, p21, IGF-1, GAP43, were analyzed. Treadmill running had no influence on gastrocnemius mass, but improved the maximal contraction force of the gastrocnemius in the treadmill running group (p < 0.05). Upregulation of GAP-43, IGF-1, Myo-D, Myf-5, myogenin, and AChR subunits α and β were found following treadmill running. The expression of genes associated with neurite and AChR regeneration following treadmill exercise was upregulated, which may have contributed to enhanced recovery of gastrocnemius strength.((PMID:15497153))The primary aim of our study was to determine whether the esophageal innervation (i.e., vagal and enteric) and the skeletal muscle-secreted neurotrophins have a role in smooth-to-skeletal muscle transdifferentiation and in the muscarinic-to-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor type transition. To that end, we used genetically engineered embryos and immunohistochemistry. We found that, in the absence of Myf5 and MyoD, the esophageal muscle cells failed to develop the striated phenotype of acetylcholine receptors. In addition, the development of vagal and enteric innervation was delayed in Myf5(-/-):MyoD(-/-) and NT-3(-/-) mutants, but it was reestablished 2 days before the end of gestation. The smooth muscle cells in the esophagus appeared to be a distinct subpopulation of cells and their ability to transdifferentiate was based on their competence to express neurotrophins and their receptors. Finally, our data suggest a role for NT-3 in the esophageal muscle transdifferentiation.((PMID:8309537))Previous studies had shown that MyoD promoted nicotinic acetylcholine subunit gene expression; the present experiments were done to determine whether this subsequently led to the development of functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Transfection of C3H 10T1/2 cells with MyoD cDNA resulted in the appearance of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites; radiolabelled alpha-toxin binding was not observed in cells transfected with a plasmid that lacked MyoD cDNA. Receptor development plateaued over a time course of several days with maximal binding seven and 11 days after exposure to fusion medium. [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding was of high affinity (Kd = 1 nM), saturable and was inhibited by nicotinic but not muscarinic receptor ligands, with IC50s of 1-3 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin, 1-3 microM for d-tubocurarine and 3-10 microM for nicotine. Not only did the cells exhibit a cell surface nicotinic receptor but they also expressed a nicotinic receptor mediated functional response. Carbachol resulted in uptake of 22Na into the cells at concentrations similar to those required for receptor activation at a muscle type nicotinic receptor; furthermore, the functional response was effectively blocked by nicotinic receptor ligands, including alpha-bungarotoxin (IC50 = 2 to 6 nM) and d-tubocurarine (IC50 = 0.1 to 0.4 microM); muscarinic receptor ligands had no effect. A time course study showed that alpha-bungarotoxin binding and carbachol stimulated 22Na uptake developed in parallel, suggesting that the observed functional response was mediated through an interaction at the alpha-bungarotoxin recognition site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)((PMID:22460713))The chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by chemerin, a secreted plasma leukocyte attractant and adipokine. Previous studies identified that CMKLR1 is expressed in skeletal muscle in a stage-specific fashion during embryogenesis and in adult mice; however, its function in skeletal muscle remains unclear. Based on the established function of CMKLR1 in cell migration and differentiation, we investigated the hypothesis that CMKLR1 regulates the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. In C(2)C(12) mouse myoblasts, CMKLR1 expression increased threefold with differentiation into multinucleated myotubes. Decreasing CMKLR1 expression by adenoviral-delivered small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) impaired the differentiation of C(2)C(12) myoblasts into mature myotubes and reduced the mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors myogenin and MyoD while increasing Myf5 and Mrf4. At embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), CMKLR1 knockout (CMKLR1(-/-)) mice appeared developmentally delayed and displayed significantly lower wet weights and a considerably diminished myotomal component of somites as revealed by immunolocalization of myosin heavy chain protein compared with wild-type (CMKLR1(+/+)) mouse embryos. These changes were associated with increased Myf5 and decreased MyoD protein expression in the somites of E12.5 CMKLR1(-/-) mouse embryos. Adult male CMKLR1(-/-) mice had significantly reduced bone-free lean mass and weighed less than the CMKLR1(+/+) mice. We conclude that CMKLR1 is essential for myogenic differentiation of C(2)C(12) cells in vitro, and the CMKLR1 null mice have a subtle skeletal muscle deficit beginning from embryonic life that persists during postnatal life.((PMID:21585421))1. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to have an important role during muscle regeneration. The regenerative capacity of muscles after contusion injury in LIF-knockout mice is impaired compared with that of wild-type mice. 2. To clarify whether LIF modulates muscle regeneration by regulating myogenic precursor cell activity, we studied LIF expression and myogenic precursor cell activity in gastrocnemius muscles from Wistar rats at various times after contusion injury using immunohistochemistry and the direct effect of LIF on a rat myoblast cell line (L6). 3. After contusion injury, transient upregulation of the mRNA expression of LIF, LIF receptors and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, downstream of LIF and involved in enhanced cell proliferation, was observed. A marked increase in LIF protein in the cytosol of damaged myofibres was strongly correlated with a significant increase in the number of myogenic precursor cells (MyoD-positive cells) by 12 h after contusion. In addition, coexpression of LIF and MyoD protein in control and injured muscles after contusion injury from 3 h to 7 days was evident. 4. Treatment of L6 cells with LIF (1 ng/mL) in serum-free medium enhanced proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) by 24 h. This was accompanied by increased expression of c-Myc protein within 12 h and was abolished by short interference RNA against c-Myc mRNA. 5. Together, the results of the present study suggest that LIF acts via paracrine and autocrine actions to regulate myogenic precursor cell activity during muscle regeneration after contusion injury and that the proliferative effect of LIF on L6 cells occurs via c-Myc signalling.((PMID:20506232))Reduced muscle mass and increased susceptibility to TNF-induced degradation accompany inflamed ageing and chronic diseases. Furthermore, C(2) myoblasts display diminished differentiation and increased susceptibility to TNF-alpha-induced cell death versus subcloned C(2)C(12) cells, providing relevant models to assess: differentiation (creatine kinase), growth (protein), death (trypan-blue) and anabolic/catabolic parameters (RT-PCR) over 72 h +/- TNF-alpha (20 ng ml(-1)). At 48 and 72 h, respectively, larger myotubes and significantly higher CK activity (320.26 +/- 6.82 vs. 30.71 +/- 2.5, P < 0.05; 544.94 +/- 27.7 vs. 39.4 +/- 3.37 mU mg ml(-1), P < 0.05), fold increases in myoD (21.45 +/- 3.12 vs. 3.97 +/- 1.76, P < 0.05; 31.07 +/- 3.1 vs. 6.82 +/- 1.93, P < 0.05) and myogenin mRNA (241.8 +/- 40 vs. 36.80 +/- 19.3, P < 0.05; 440 +/- 100.5 vs. 201.1 +/- 86, P < 0.05) were detected in C(2)C(12) versus C(2). C(2)C(12) showed significant increases in IGF-I mRNA (243.05 +/- 3.87 vs. 105.75 +/- 21.95, P < 0.05), reduced proliferation and significantly lower protein expression (1.21 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.29 mg ml(-1), P < 0.05) at 72 h versus C(2) cells. Significant temporal reductions in C(2)C(12) IGFBP2 mRNA (28.02 +/- 15.44, 13.82 +/- 8.07, 6.92 +/- 4.37, P < 0.05) contrasted increases in C(2)s (4.31 +/- 3.31, 13.02 +/- 9.92, 82.9 +/- 58.9, P < 0.05) at 0, 48 and 72 h, respectively. TNF-alpha increased cell death in C(2)s (2.67 +/- 1.54%, 34.42 +/- 5.39%, 29.71 +/- 5.79% (0, 48, 72 h), P < 0.05), yet was without effect in C(2)C(12)s at 48 h but caused a small significant increase at 72 h (9.88 +/- 4.02% (TNF-alpha) vs. 6.17 +/- 0.749% (DM), 72 h). TNF-alpha and TNFRI mRNA were unchanged; however, larger reductions in IGF-I (8.2- and 7.5-fold vs. 4.5- and 4.1-fold (48, 72 h)), IGF-IR (2-fold vs. no-significant reduction (72 h)) and IGFBP5 (3.24 vs. 1.38 (48 h) and 2.21 vs. 1.71 (72 h), P < 0.05) mRNA were observed in C(2) versus C(2)C(12) with TNF-alpha. This investigation provides insight into regulators of altered basal hypertrophy and TNF-induced atrophy, providing a model for future investigation into therapeutic initiatives for ageing/wasting disorders.((PMID:18397613))Contrary to general expectation, in humans, we have recently shown that after complete conus cauda lesion, the lower motoneuron denervated myofibers may survive several years. In adult rats, the sciatectomized muscle progresses in 4-6 months from severe atrophy to a dystrophic stage and undergoes a dramatic weight loss; during this process, myofiber death/regeneration processes maintain a decreasing population of very small, but vital myofibers. At the same time, in vitro electrophysiologic recordings show that denervated fibers can maintain membrane excitability longer than they can retain contractile properties. A certain level of myofiber regeneration seems to have a role in the process, with the early re-expression of embryonic subunits of integrins and acetylcholine receptor subunits. In the present work, using the reliable real-time quantitative PCR, we confirm the long-lasting occurrence of myoblast proliferation-dependent events and their focal nature. In fact, we show here that in sciatectomized muscle, the expression of 12 selected genes was differentially regulated after 3 and 9 month denervation. At both time points, indexes of muscle activity/inactivity and tissue remodeling (proteolysis, energy usage and angiogenic factors) were down-regulated, while indexes of regenerative myogenesis (Myogenin, MyoD, MRF4 and MHCemb) were up-regulated. Immunohistochemistry with anti-MHCemb and anti-NCAM monoclonal antibodies show that such regeneration events were focally distributed. We conclude that myofiber regeneration is a non-compensatory mechanism, which prolongs the chance of reinnervation during long-lasting denervation. It may also contribute to muscle recovery in paraplegic patients, even when rehabilitation strategies based on functional electric stimulation start late after spinal cord injury (SCI).((PMID:17855775))Xin is a muscle-specific actin binding protein of which its role and regulation within skeletal muscle is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that Xin mRNA is robustly upregulated (>16-fold) within 12 h of skeletal muscle injury and is localized to the muscle satellite cell population. RT-PCR confirmed the expression pattern of Xin during regeneration, as well as within primary muscle myoblast cultures, but not other known stem cell populations. Immunohistochemical staining of single myofibers demonstrate Xin expression colocalized with the satellite cell marker Syndecan-4 further supporting the mRNA expression of Xin in satellite cells. In situ hybridization of regenerating muscle 5-7 days postinjury illustrates Xin expression within newly regenerated myofibers. Promoter-reporter assays demonstrate that known myogenic transcription factors [myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), myogenic differentiation-1 (MyoD), and myogenic factor-5 (Myf-5)] transactivate Xin promoter constructs supporting the muscle-specific expression of Xin. To determine the role of Xin within muscle precursor cells, proliferation, migration, and differentiation analysis using Xin, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were undertaken in C2C12 myoblasts. Reducing endogenous Xin expression resulted in a 26% increase (P < 0.05) in cell proliferation and a 20% increase (P < 0.05) in myoblast migratory capacity. Skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain protein levels were increased (P < 0.05) with Xin shRNA administration; however, this was not accompanied by changes in myoglobin protein (another marker of differentiation) nor overt morphological differences relative to differentiating control cells. Taken together, the present findings support the hypothesis that Xin is expressed within muscle satellite cells during skeletal muscle regeneration and is involved in the regulation of myoblast function.((PMID:11254504))The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) 2 belongs to a family of plasma membrane transporters involved in intracellular pH and cell volume regulation. We recently reported cloning of human NHE2 (hNHE2) from a colonic cDNA library. Northern blot analysis has identified NHE2 mRNA only in small intestine, prostate, kidney, colon, and skeletal muscle. In this study, we describe the structure and 5'-regulatory region of the hNHE2 gene. The hNHE2 gene spans >90 kb and is organized in 12 exons intervened by 11 introns. All introns contain the conserved GT and AG dinucleotides at the donor and acceptor sites, respectively. The hNHE2 gene was mapped to chromosome 2q11.2. Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcription initiation site in human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Analysis of the DNA nucleotide sequences of a 1.4-kb fragment of the 5'-flanking region shows no canonical TATA or CAAT boxes. However, the promoter region contains several potential cis-regulatory elements such as Sp1, early growth response-1, activator protein-2, MyoD, p300, nuclear factor-kappaB, myeloid zinc finger protein-1, caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) gene A, and Cdx protein-2 binding sites. In transient transfection studies, a reporter construct containing the 1.4-kb promoter region exhibited low luciferase activity levels. However, after deletion upstream of -664, its activity increased approximately threefold. Thus our data suggest that an inhibitory element may exist in the NHE2 promoter 5'-upstream region.((PMID:22859371))Brown fat or brown adipose tissue (BAT), found in newborn mammals as small depots localized in the interscapular region, plays a prominent role in regulating thermogenesis perinatally. The physiological importance of functional BAT has been recently reasserted in human adults. Because myoblasts and adipoblasts emerge from a common mesodermal precursor, we investigated developmental determination and the reciprocal relationship between muscle and adipocyte commitment. Here we show that a mutant mouse defective for both Igf2 and Myod genes exhibits massive BAT hypertrophy compared with wild-type and single-mutant newborns. The increased adipocyte proliferation in BAT of double-mutant newborns was associated with overexpression of the brown fat-specific marker Ucp1. More strikingly, expression of the master key gene Prdm16 involved in the switch between myogenic and brown adipogenic lineages was drastically enhanced. We further demonstrate that concomitant Myod and Igf2 inactivation accelerates differentiation of a brown preadipocyte cell line and induces lipid accumulation and increased Ucp1 and Prdm16 expression. This in vitro approach brings additional support for the implication of both Myod and Igf2 in BAT development. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that a myogenic regulator together with a growth factor act simultaneously but through independent pathways to repress Prdm16, which opens potential therapeutic perspectives for human metabolic disorders.((PMID:20053730))Gene promoters are enriched in guanine clusters that potentially fold into quadruplex structures. Such quadruplexes were implicated in the regulation of gene expression, plausibly by interacting with transcription factors. We showed previously that homodimers of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD bound in vitro most tightly bimolecular quadruplexes of promoter sequences of muscle-specific genes. By contrast, MyoD-E47 heterodimers formed tighter complexes with d(CANNTG) E-box motifs that govern muscle gene expression. Here, we show that DNA quadruplexes enhance in vivo MyoD and E-box-driven expression of a firefly luciferase (FL) reporter gene. HEK293 cells were transfected with FL expressing p4RTK-FL vector alone or together with MyoD expressing pEMSV-MyoD plasmid, with quadruplexes of alpha7 integrin or sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK) muscle gene promoters or with a combination thereof. Whereas MyoD elevated by approximately 10-fold the levels of FL mRNA and protein, the DNA quadruplexes by themselves did not affect FL expression. However, together with MyoD, quadruplex DNA increased by approximately 35-fold the amounts of FL mRNA and protein. Without affecting its expression, DNA quadruplexes bound MyoD in the cells. Based on these results, we propose models for the regulation of muscle gene transcription by direct interaction of MyoD with promoter quadruplex structures.((PMID:18511462))Four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs); MyoD, Myf-5, MRF4 and Myogenin direct muscle tissue differentiation. Heterodimers of MRFs with E-proteins activate muscle-specific gene expression by binding to E-box motifs d(CANNTG) in their promoters or enhancers. We showed previously that in contrast to the favored binding of E-box by MyoD-E47 heterodimers, homodimeric MyoD associated preferentially with quadruplex structures of regulatory sequences of muscle-specific genes. To inquire whether other MRFs shared the DNA binding preferences of MyoD, the DNA affinities of hetero- and homo-dimeric MyoD, MRF4 and Myogenin were compared. Similarly to MyoD, heterodimers with E47 of MRF4 or Myogenin bound E-box more tightly than quadruplex DNA. However, unlike homodimeric MyoD or MRF4, Myogenin homodimers associated weakly and nonpreferentially with quadruplex DNA. By reciprocally switching basic regions between MyoD and Myogenin we demonstrated dominance of MyoD in determining the quadruplex DNA-binding affinity. Thus, Myogenin with an implanted MyoD basic region bound quadruplex DNA nearly as tightly as MyoD. However, a grafted Myogenin basic region did not diminish the high affinity of homodimeric MyoD for quadruplex DNA. We speculate that the dissimilar interaction of MyoD and Myogenin with tetrahelical domains in muscle gene promoters may differently regulate their myogenic activities.((PMID:17942416))Muscle differentiation and expression of muscle-specific proteins are initiated by the binding of heterodimers of the transcription factor MyoD with E2A proteins to E-box motif d(CANNTG) in promoters or enhancers of muscle-specific genes. MyoD homodimers, however, form tighter complexes with tetraplex structures of guanine-rich regulatory sequences of some muscle genes. In this work, we identified elements in MyoD that bind E-box or tetraplex structures of promoter sequences of the muscle-specific genes alpha7 integrin and sarcomeric Mitochondrial Creatine Kinase (sMtCK). Deletions of large domains of the 315 amino acids long recombinant MyoD indicated that the binding site for both E-box and tetraplex DNA is its basic region KRKTTNADRRKAATMRERRR that encompasses the three underlined clusters of basic residues designated R(1), R(2) and R(3). Deletion of a single or pairs of R triads or R111C substitution completely abolished the E-box-binding capacity of MyoD. By contrast, the MyoD deletion mutants Delta102-114, DeltaR(3), DeltaR(1)R(3) or DeltaR(2)R(3) maintained comparable tetraplex DNA-binding capacity as reflected by the similar dissociation constants of their protein-DNA complexes. Only deletion of all three basic clusters abolished the binding of tetraplex DNA. Implications of the binding of E-box and tetraplex DNA by non-identical MyoD elements are considered.((PMID:17553906))Muscle formation and vascular assembly during embryonic development are usually considered separately. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the vasculature and muscles during limb bud development. We show that endothelial cells are detected in limb regions before muscle cells and can organize themselves in space in the absence of muscles. In chick limbs, endothelial cells are detected in the future zones of muscle cleavage, delineating the cleavage pattern of muscle masses. We therefore perturbed vascular assembly in chick limbs by overexpressing VEGFA and demonstrated that ectopic blood vessels inhibit muscle formation, while promoting connective tissue. Conversely, local inhibition of vessel formation using a soluble form of VEGFR1 leads to muscle fusion. The endogenous location of endothelial cells in the future muscle cleavage zones and the inverse correlation between blood vessels and muscle suggests that vessels are involved in the muscle splitting process. We also identify the secreted factor PDGFB (expressed in endothelial cells) as a putative molecular candidate mediating the muscle-inhibiting and connective tissue-promoting functions of blood vessels. Finally, we propose that PDGFB promotes the production of extracellular matrix and attracts connective tissue cells to the future splitting site, allowing separation of the muscle masses during the splitting process.((PMID:15923190))Myogenic transcription is activated by the binding of heterodimers of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins MyoD and E12 or E47 to a consensus E-box sequence, d(CANNTG), in promoter or enhancer regions of muscle-specific genes. Homodimers of MyoD bind E-box less tightly and are less efficient activators of transcription. Recent results from our laboratory (Yafe, A., Etzioni, S., Weisman-Shomer, P., and Fry, M. (2005) Nucleic Acids Res. 33, 2887-2900) indicate that regulatory sequences of several muscle-specific genes contain a disproportionate high content of guanine clusters that readily form hairpin and parallel-stranded unimolecular and bimolecular tetraplex structures. Here we have shown that homodimers of full-length recombinant MyoD formed complexes with bimolecular tetraplex structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences but not with their double-stranded, hairpin, or unimolecular tetraplex forms. Preferential binding of homodimeric MyoD to bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures over E-box DNA was reflected by the 18.7-39.9-fold lower dissociation constants, Kd, of the MyoD-tetraplex DNA complexes. Conversely, MyoD-E47 heterodimers formed tighter complexes with E-box as indicated by their 6.8-19.0-fold lower Kd relative to complexes with bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures. Similarly, homodimers of the 60-amino acid basic helix-loop-helix domain of MyoD bound E-box more efficiently and tetraplex DNA less efficiently than homodimers of full-length MyoD. It might be that the favored binding of MyoD homodimers to tetraplex DNA structures lowers their ability to activate muscle-specific gene transcription, whereas the formation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers and their preferential binding to E-box DNA enhance transcription.((PMID:15908587))Clustered guanine residues in DNA readily generate hairpin or a variety of tetrahelical structures. The myogenic determination protein MyoD was reported to bind to a tetrahelical structure of guanine-rich enhancer sequence of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) more tightly than to its target E-box motif [K. Walsh and A. Gualberto (1992) J. Biol. Chem., 267, 13714-13718], suggesting that tetraplex structures of regulatory sequences of muscle-specific genes could contribute to transcriptional regulation. In the current study we show that promoter or enhancer sequences of various muscle-specific genes display a disproportionately high incidence of guanine clusters. The sequences derived from the guanine-rich promoter or enhancer regions of three muscle-specific genes, human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK), mouse MCK and alpha7 integrin formed diverse secondary structures. The sMtCK sequence folded into a hairpin structure; the alpha7 integrin oligonucleotide generated a unimolecular tetraplex; and sequences from all three genes associated to generate bimolecular tetraplexes. Furthermore, two neighboring non-contiguous guanine-rich tracts in the alpha7 integrin promoter region also paired to form a tetraplex structure. We also show that homodimeric MyoD bound bimolecular tetraplex structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences more efficiently than its target E-box motif. These results are consistent with a role of tetrahelical structures of DNA in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression.((PMID:14724123))Forced expression of the bHLH myogenic factors, Myf5 and MyoD, in various mammalian cell lines induces the full program of myogenic differentiation. However, this property has not been extensively explored in vivo. We have taken advantage of the chick model to investigate the effect of electroporation of the mouse Myf5 and MyoD genes in the embryonic neural tube. We found that misexpression of either mouse Myf5 or MyoD in the chick neural tube leads to ectopic skeletal muscle differentiation, assayed by the expression of the myosin heavy chains in the neural tube and neural crest derivatives. We also showed that the endogenous neuronal differentiation program is inhibited under the influence of either ectopic mouse Myf5 or MyoD. We used this new system to analyse, in vivo, the transcriptional regulation between the myogenic factors. We found that MyoD and Myogenin expression can be activated by ectopic mouse Myf5 or MyoD, while Myf5 expression cannot be activated either by mouse MyoD or by itself. We also analysed the transcriptional regulation between the myogenic factors and the different genes involved in myogenesis, such as Mef2c, Pax3, Paraxis, Six1, Mox1, Mox2 and FgfR4. We established the existence of an unexpected regulatory loop between MyoD and FgfR4. The consequences for myogenesis are discussed.((PMID:27480135))Despite a demonstrated role for TNF-α in promoting muscle wasting and cachexia, the associated molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of myoblast differentiation dysregulated by TNF-α remain poorly understood. This study presents well-controlled proteomic profiling as a means to investigate the mechanisms of TNF-α-regulated myogenic differentiation. Primary human muscle precursor cells (MPCs) cultured in growth medium (GM), differentiation medium (DM) to induce myogenic differentiation, and DM with 20 ng/mL of TNF-α (n = 5/group) were comparatively analyzed by an ion current-based quantitative platform consisting of reproducible sample preparation/on-pellet digestion, a long-column nano-LC separation, and ion current-based differential analysis. The inhibition of myogenic differentiation by TNF-α was confirmed by reduced formation of multinucleated myotubes and the recovered expression of altered myogenic proteins such as MYOD and myogenin during myogenic differentiation. Functional analysis and validation by immunoassay analysis suggested that the cooperation of NF-κB and STAT proteins is responsible for dysregulated differentiation in MPCs by TNF-α treatment. Increased MHC class I components such as HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and beta-2-microglobulin were also observed in cultures in DM treated with TNF-α. Interestingly, inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway during myogenic differentiation induced by serum starvation was not recovered by TNF-α treatment, which combined with previous reports, implies that this process may be an early event of myogenesis. This finding could lay the foundation for the potential use of statins in modulating myogenesis through cholesterol, for example, in stem cell-based myocardial infarction treatment, where differentiation of myoblasts and stem cells into force-generating mature muscle cells is a key step to the therapeutic capacity. In conclusion, the landscapes of altered transcription regulators, metabolic processes, and signaling pathways in MPCs are revealed in the regulation of myogenic differentiation by TNF-α, which is valuable for myogenic cellular therapeutics.((PMID:22921450))Skeletal myogenesis comprises myoblast replication and differentiation into striated multinucleated myotubes. Agents that interfere with myoblast replication are important tools for the understanding of myogenesis. Recently, we showed that cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) enhances the differentiation step in chick-cultured myogenic cells, involving the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the effects of cholesterol depletion on myoblast replication have not been carefully studied. Here we show that MCD treatment increases cell proliferation in primary chick myogenic cell cultures. Treatment of myogenic cells with the anti-mitotic reagent cytosine arabinoside, immediately following cholesterol depletion, blocks the MCD-induced effects on proliferation. Cholesterol depletion induced an increase in the number of desmin-positive mononucleated cells, and an increase in desmin expression. MCD induces an increase in the expression of the cell cycle regulator p53 and the master switch gene MyoD1. Treatment with BIO, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β, induced effects similar to MCD on cell proliferation; while treatment with Dkk1, a specific inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, neutralized the effects of MCD. These findings indicate that rapid changes in the cholesterol content in cell membranes of myoblasts can induce cell proliferation, possibly by the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.((PMID:22531117))Positive feedback is a common mechanism enabling biological systems to respond to stimuli in a switch-like manner. Such systems are often characterized by the requisite formation of a heterodimer where only one of the pair is subject to feedback. This ASymmetric Self-UpREgulation (ASSURE) motif is central to many biological systems, including cholesterol homeostasis (LXRα/RXRα), adipocyte differentiation (PPARγ/RXRα), development and differentiation (RAR/RXR), myogenesis (MyoD/E12) and cellular antiviral defense (IRF3/IRF7). To understand why this motif is so prevalent, we examined its properties in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory network in yeast (Oaf1p/Pip2p). We demonstrate that the asymmetry in positive feedback confers a competitive advantage and allows the system to robustly increase its responsiveness while precisely tuning the response to a consistent level in the presence of varying stimuli. This study reveals evolutionary advantages for the ASSURE motif, and mechanisms for control, that are relevant to pharmacologic intervention and synthetic biology applications.((PMID:18572367))Classic studies of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury have been performed using young healthy mice. However, patients with peripheral vascular disease are older and often exhibit metabolic derangements that may delay healing after revascularization. Mice with genetic deletion of apolipoprotein E (ApoE(-/-)) have been used as a model in various experimental scenarios of hypercholesterolemia. These experiments evaluated the inflammatory response and changes in skeletal muscle morphology during the acute and chronic phases of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in aged ApoE(-/-) mice.Age-matched ApoE(-/-) and wild-type (Wt) mice underwent 1.5 hours of unilateral hind limb ischemia, followed by 1, 7, or 14 days of reperfusion (DR). Histologic analysis of skeletal muscle fiber injury was assessed at 1DR. Morphologic evidence of muscular fiber maturation was assessed at 14DR. Levels of MyoD and myogenin, markers of skeletal muscle differentiation, were assessed at 7 and 14DR using Western blots. Markers of inflammation, including myeloperoxidase, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and osteopontin, were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) using Western blots at 1, 7, and 14DR. After 1DR, tissue adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured to assess metabolic activity. Unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparisons.Histologic evaluation of skeletal muscle after 1DR showed no difference in the degree of injury between Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice. However, at 14DR, ApoE(-/-) mice had higher percentage of immature muscle fibers than Wt mice. Myogenin level was lower in the ApoE(-/-) mice at 7DR. Injured skeletal muscle of ApoE(-/-) mice had lower levels of myeloperoxidase than Wt mice at 7 DR and higher levels of MCP-1 at 14DR. There was no difference in the levels of tissue ATP, MIP-2, osteopontin, or CCR2 at all experimental intervals.Although there was no difference between the injured muscle of Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice during the acute phase of reperfusion, ApoE(-/-) mice showed delay in skeletal muscle healing during the chronic phase of reperfusion. This lag in muscle regeneration was associated with lower levels of myogenin at 7DR and an increased level of MCP-1 at 14DR in the ApoE(-/-) mice. The delay in skeletal muscle healing in the ApoE(-/-) mice may have broader implications for poor tissue healing and functional recovery in elderly patients who have vascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.((PMID:15522925))Previous studies of Delta 4-androstene-3,17-dione (4-androstenedione) administration in men have not demonstrated sustained increments in testosterone levels, fat-free mass (FFM), and muscle strength, and failure to demonstrate androstenedione's androgenic/anabolic effects has stifled efforts to regulate its sales. To determine whether 4-androstenedione has androgenic/anabolic properties, we evaluated its association with androgen receptor (AR) and its effects on myogenesis in vitro. Additionally, we studied the effects of a high dose of 4-androstenedione on testosterone levels, FFM, and muscle strength in hypogonadal men. We determined the dissociation constant (K(d)) for 4-androstenedione using fluorescence anisotropy measurement of competitive displacement of fluorescent androgen from AR ligand-binding domain. AR nuclear translocation and myogenic activity of androstenedione were evaluated in mesenchymal, pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells, in which androgens stimulate myogenesis through an AR pathway. We determined effects of a high dose of androstenedione (500 mg thrice daily) given for 12 wk on FFM, muscle strength, and hormone levels in nine healthy, hypogonadal men. 4-Androstenedione competitively displaced fluorescent androgen from AR ligand-binding domain with a lower affinity than dihydrotestosterone (K(d), 648 +/- 21 and 10 +/- 0.4 nm, respectively). In C3H10T1/2 cells, 4-androstenedione caused nuclear translocation of AR and stimulated myogenesis, as indicated by a dose-dependent increase in myosin heavy chain II+ myotube area and up-regulation of MyoD protein. Stimulatory effects of 4-androstenedione on myosin heavy chain II+ myotubes and myogenic determination factor expression were attenuated by bicalutamide, an AR antagonist. Administration of 1500 mg 4-androstenedione daily to hypogonadal men significantly increased serum androstenedione, total and free testosterone, estradiol, and estrone levels and suppressed SHBG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. 4-androstenedione administration was associated with significant gains in FFM (+1.7 +/- 0.5 kg; P = 0.012) and muscle strength in bench press (+4.3 +/- 3.1 kg; P = 0.006) and leg press exercises (+18.8 +/- 17.3 kg; P = 0.045). 4-androstenedione is an androgen that binds AR, induces AR nuclear translocation, and promotes myogenesis in vitro, with substantially lower potency than dihydrotestosterone. 4-androstenedione administration in high doses to hypogonadal men increases testosterone levels, FFM, and muscle strength, although at the dose tested, the anabolic effects in hypogonadal men are likely because of its conversion to testosterone.((PMID:23602632))Dioxins (e.g. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; TCDD) cause cleft palate at a high rate. A post-fusional split may contribute to the pathogenesis, and tissue fragility may be a concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of TCDD on the palatal epithelium, bone and muscle, which contribute to tissue integrity. ICR mice (10-12 weeks old) were used. TCDD was administered on E12.5 at 40 mg/kg. Immunohistochemical staining for AhR, ER-α, laminin, collagen IV, osteopontin, Runx2, MyoD, and desmin were performed. Furthermore, western blot analysis for osteopontin, Runx2, MyoD, and desmin were performed to evaluate protein expression in the palatal tissue. Immunohistologically, there was little difference in the collagen IV and laminin localization in the palatal epithelium between control versus TCDD-treated mice. Runx2 and osteopontin immunoreactivity decreased in the TCDD-treated palatal bone, and MyoD and desmin decreased in the TCDD-treated palatal muscle. AhR and ER-α immunoreactivity were localized to the normal palatal bone, but ER-α was diminished in the TCDD-treated palate. On western blot analysis, Runx2, MyoD, and desmin were all downregulated in the TCDD-treated palate. TCDD may suppress palatal osteogenesis and myogenesis via AhR, and cause cleft palates via a post-fusional split mechanism, in addition to a failure of palatal fusion.((PMID:9733792))Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) nuclear translocator (Arnt) gene has been isolated and characterized from a mouse genomic DNA library. The gene is about 60 kilobases long and split into 22 exons. An unusual exon/intron junctional sequence was found in the 11th intron of the gene that begins with GC at its 5'-end. The exon/intron arrangement of mArnt gene differs greatly from those of the other members of the same basic-helix-loop-helix/PAS family. The gene is TATA-less and has several transcription start sites. The promoter region of the mArnt gene is GC-rich and contains a number of putative regulatory DNA sequences such as two GC-boxes, a cAMP-responsive element, E-box, AP-1 site, and CAAT-box. Deletion experiments revealed that all these DNA elements made substantial contributions to a high level of expression of the gene, except for the cAMP-responsive element. Of all, two GC-boxes displayed the most dominant enhancing effects. It was demonstrated that there exist specific factors binding to these DNA elements in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. Among them, Sp1 and Sp3, and CAAT-box binding factor-A were identified to bind the GC-boxes and CAAT-box, respectively. Expression of MyoD in HeLa cells stimulated the Arnt promoter activity by binding to the E-box.((PMID:8287061))The AH-receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates a number of biological responses to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. Interest in this receptor is related to its role in the toxic action of a variety of environmental chemicals, the simplicity and elegance of the murine genetics that led to its characterization and the distinctive mechanism by which this receptor activates gene expression. Recent cloning experiments have demonstrated that the AH-receptor is structurally related to the Per, ARNT and Sim proteins. Members of this newly described gene family are characterized by two N-terminal domains, the most characteristic of which is a motif referred to as a PAS domain. In the AH-receptor, this domain harbours sequences involved in the formation of a hydrophobic pocket that bind receptor agonists. Adjacent to the PAS domain in the AH-receptor, ARNT and Sim proteins is a basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that appears to mediate heterodimerization and sequence specific DNA binding properties. The observation that the bHLH domain is present in the AH-receptor and the ARNT protein, a factor required for proper AH-receptor function, suggests that these proteins are heterodimeric partners that activate gene expression in a manner similar to Myc/Max and MyoD/E2A. The objectives of this review are to describe recent experimental results in this field and to use this information to develop a molecular model of AH-receptor mediated signal transduction.((PMID:1325649))A cDNA encoding the murine Ah receptor (Ahb-1 allele for aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness) has been isolated and characterized. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence revealed a region with similarity to the basic region/helix-loop-helix (BR/HLH) motif found in many transcription factors that undergo dimerization for function. In addition to the BR/HLH domain, the N-terminal domain of the Ah receptor has extensive sequence similarity to the human ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) protein and two regulatory proteins of Drosophila, Sim and Per. Photoaffinity labeling and peptide mapping studies indicate that the Ah receptor binds agonist at a domain that lies within this conserved N-terminal domain. The Ah receptor appears to be a ligand-activated transcription factor with a helix-loop-helix motif similar to those found in a variety of DNA-binding proteins, including Myc and MyoD.((PMID:10544245))The protein chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a major regulator of different transcription factors such as MyoD, a basic helix loop helix (bHLH) protein, and the bHLH-Per-aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT)-Sim (PAS) factors Sim and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), involved in the response to hypoxia, also belongs to the bHLH-PAS family. This work was aimed to investigate the putative role of Hsp90 in HIF-1 activation by hypoxia. Using a EGFP-HIF-1alpha fusion protein, co-immunoprecipitation experiments evidenced that the chimeric protein expressed in COS-7 cells interacts with Hsp90 in normoxia but not in hypoxia. We also demonstrated that Hsp90 interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of HIF-1alpha. Moreover, Hsp90 is not co-translocated with HIF-1alpha into the nucleus. At last, we showed that Hsp90 activity is essential for HIF-1 activation in hypoxia since it is inhibited in the presence of geldanamycin. These results indicate that Hsp90 is a major regulator in HIF-1alpha activation.((PMID:25721560))Polymorphisms in the promoter region are likely to impact KISS1 gene transcription and reproductive traits. In this study, Guanzhong (GZ, n=350) and Boer (BE, n=196) goats were used to detect polymorphism in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene by DNA sequencing. In the GZ goats, the g.1384G>A mutation was identified in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene. Guanzhong goats were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at g.1384G>A locus (P<0.05). The 1384A allele was predicted to eliminate methylation, AHR-arnt heterodimers and AHR-related factors (AHRR) and myoblast determining factors (MYOD) transcription factor-binding sites. Statistical results indicated that the g.1384G>A SNP was associated with litter size in the GZ goats (P<0.05). Luciferase assay analysis suggested that the 1384A allele increased luciferase activity when compared to the 1384G allele. The RT-qPCR assay also demonstrated that the 1384A allele had greater amounts of KISS1 mRNA than the 1384G allele in homozygous individuals. Functional analysis suggested that this g.1384G>A SNP may be an important genetic regulator of KISS1 gene expression with effects on downstream processes that are modulated by KISS1 gene because of the changes of methylation and transcription factor-binding sites. Therefore, the current study provides evidence in goats for genetic markers that might be used in breeding programs.((PMID:22210883))The myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) gene is a master regulator of myogenesis. We previously reported that the expression of MyoD mRNA oscillates over 24 h in skeletal muscle and that the circadian clock transcription factors, BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1) and CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput), were bound to the core enhancer (CE) of the MyoD gene in vivo. In this study, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that the CE is necessary for circadian expression of MyoD in adult muscle. Gel shift assays identified a conserved non-canonical E-box within the CE that is bound by CLOCK and BMAL1. Functional analysis revealed that this E-box was required for full activation by BMAL1/CLOCK and for in vitro circadian oscillation. Expression profiling of muscle of CE(loxP/loxP) mice found approximately 1300 genes mis-expressed relative to wild-type. Based on the informatics results, we analyzed the respiratory function of mitochondria isolated from wild-type and CE(loxP/loxP) mice. These assays determined that State 5 respiration was significantly reduced in CE(loxP/loxP) muscle. The results of this work identify a novel element in the MyoD enhancer that confers circadian regulation to MyoD in skeletal muscle and suggest that loss of circadian regulation leads to changes in myogenic expression and downstream mitochondrial function.((PMID:15233999))Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, caused by the expansion of the (CAG)n tract in the MJD gene. This encodes the protein ataxin-3, of unknown function. The mouse Mjd gene has a structure similar to that of its human counterpart and it also contains a TATA-less promoter. Its 5' flanking region contains conserved putative binding regions for transcription factors Sp1, USF, Arnt, Max, E47, and MyoD. Upon differentiation of P19 cells, the Mjd gene promoter is preferentially activated in endodermal and mesodermal derivatives, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes; and less so in neuronal precursors. Mouse ataxin-3 is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and in the adult, with strong expression in regions of the CNS affected in MJD. It is particularly abundant in all types of muscle and in ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting that it may be associated with the cytoskeleton and may have an important function in cell structure and/or motility.((PMID:15169898))Myogenesis is an intricate process that coordinately engages multiple intracellular signaling cascades. The Rho family GTPase RhoA is known to promote myogenesis, however, the mechanisms controlling its regulation in myoblasts have yet to be fully elucidated. We show here that the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, functions as an early modulator of myogenesis by regulating RhoA. When MyoD was expressed in fibroblasts lacking functional SHP-2, muscle-specific gene activity was impaired and abolition of SHP-2 expression by RNA interference inhibited muscle differentiation. By using SHP-2 substrate-trapping mutants, we identified p190-B RhoGAP as a SHP-2 substrate. When dephosphorylated, p190-B RhoGAP has been shown to stimulate the activation of RhoA. During myogenesis, p190-B RhoGAP was tyrosyl dephosphorylated concomitant with the stimulation of SHP-2's phosphatase activity. Moreover, overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 inhibited p190-B RhoGAP tyrosyl dephosphorylation, RhoA activity, and myogenesis. These observations strongly suggest that SHP-2 dephosphorylates p190-B RhoGAP, leading to the activation of RhoA. Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for RhoA activation in myoblasts and demonstrate that myogenesis is critically regulated by the actions of SHP-2 on the p190-B Rho GAP/RhoA pathway.((PMID:11493654))Myogenesis is a highly ordered process that involves the expression of muscle-specific genes, cell-cell recognition and multinucleated myotube formation. Although protein tyrosine kinases have figured prominently in myogenesis, the involvement of tyrosine phosphatases in this process is unknown. SHP-2 is an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, which positively regulates growth and differentiation. We show that in C2C12 myoblasts, SHP-2 becomes upregulated early on during myogenesis and associates with a 120 kDa tyrosyl-phosphorylated complex. We have identified that the 120 kDa complex consists of the SHP-2 substrate-1 (SHPS-1) and the Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab-1). SHPS-1, but not Gab-1, undergoes tyrosyl phosphorylation and association with SHP-2 during myogenesis, the kinetics of which correlate with the expression of MyoD. Either constitutive expression or inducible activation of MyoD in 10T(1/2) fibroblasts promotes SHPS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and its association with SHP-2. It has been shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is required for the expression/activation of MyoD and MyoD-responsive genes. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts blocks MyoD expression, SHPS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and the association of SHPS-1 with SHP-2. These data suggest that SHPS-1/SHP-2 complex formation is an integral signaling component of skeletal muscle differentiation.((PMID:9696036))Shp-2 is a ubiquitously expressed tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains. Homozygous mutant mice with a targeted deletion of 65 amino acid residues in the N-terminal SH2 domain of Shp-2 die in utero at mid-gestation, with multiple defects in mesodermal patterning. To surpass the embryonic lethality in dissecting the Shp-2 function in cell growth and differentiation, we established homozygous Shp-2 mutant embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. Our previous data showed a severe suppression of hematopoietic cell differentiation from Shp-2 mutant ES cells. Here we demonstrate that development of cardiac muscle cells was dramatically delayed and impaired in embryoid bodies (EBs) of Shp-2 mutant origin. Shp-2 mutant ES cells failed to differentiate into epithelial and fibroblast cells in vitro. However, higher efficiency of secondary EB formation was observed from the mutant than the wild-type ES cells. Further, mutant ES cells were more sensitive than wild-type cells to the differentiation suppressing effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In addition, mutant ES cells showed a reduced growth rate compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that the Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase is a positive regulator for both cell differentiation and proliferation, in contrast to the Src-family kinases which promote cell growth but block differentiation.((PMID:10406466))Classical ligand-activated nuclear receptors (e.g. thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor), orphan nuclear receptors (e.g. Rev-erbAalpha/beta), Mad/Max bHLH (basic helix loop helix)-LZ proteins, and oncoproteins, PLZF and LAZ3/BCL6, bind DNA and silence transcription by recruiting a repressor complex that contains N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor)/SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor), Sin3A/B, and HDAc-1/-2 proteins. The function of the corepressor, N-CoR, in the process of cellular differentiation and coupled phenotypic acquisition, has not been investigated. We examined the functional role of N-CoR in myogenesis (muscle differentiation), an ideal paradigm for the analysis of the determinative events that govern the cell's decision to divide or differentiate. We observed that the mRNA encoding N-CoR was suppressed as proliferating myoblasts exited the cell cycle, and formed morphologically and biochemically differentiated myotubes. Exogenous expression of N-CoR (but not RIP13) in myogenic cells ablated 1) myogenic differentiation, 2) the expression of the myoD gene family that encode the myogenic specific bHLH proteins, and 3) the crucial cell cycle regulator, p21Waf-1/Cip-1 mRNA. Furthermore, N-CoR expression efficiently inhibits the myoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential C3H10T1/2 cells. We demonstrate that MyoD-mediated transactivation and activity are repressed by N-CoR. The mechanism involves direct interactions between MyoD and N-CoR; moreover, the interaction was dependent on the amino-terminal repression domain (RD1) of N-CoR and the bHLH region of MyoD. Trichostatin A treatment significantly stimulated the activity of MyoD by approximately 10-fold and inhibited the ability of N-CoR to repress MyoD-mediated transactivation, consistent with the involvement of the corepressor and the recruitment of a histone deacteylase activity in the process. This work demonstrates that the corepressor N-CoR is a key regulator of MyoD activity and mammalian differentiation, and that N-CoR has a multifaceted role in myogenesis.((PMID:27493874))Sarcopenic obesity, age-related muscle loss, which is compensated by an increase in fat mass, impairs quality of life in elderly people. Although the increase in intramuscular fat is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and increased metabolic risk factors, the origin of diabetes-associated intramuscular fat has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated intramuscular fat deposition using a muscle injury model in type 2 diabetic mice.Male 8-week-old C57BL/6 and 8-week-old and 26-week-old KKAy underwent intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin (Ctx) (100 μL/10 μM) into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. After 2 weeks, the muscles were removed and evaluated.KKAy exhibited impaired muscle regeneration and ectopic fat deposition. Such impairment was more marked in older KKAy. These changes were also observed in another diabetic mouse model, db/db and diet-induced obese mice but not in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. Deposited fat was platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha positive and its cytoskeleton was stained with Masson's trichrome, indicating it to be of fibro-adipocyte progenitor cell origin. Expression of a myogenic marker, myoD, was lower and that of PDGF receptor alpha and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (CEBP) alpha was higher in Ctx-injured TA of KKAy compared with that of C57BL/6. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was highly expressed in fat-forming lesions in older KKAy. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid prevented the formation of intramuscular fat; however, treatment with GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, increased the fibrotic change in muscle.Diabetic mice showed impaired muscle regeneration with fat deposition, suggesting that diabetes may enhance sarcopenic obesity through a mechanism involving anomalous fibro-adipocyte progenitor cell differentiation.((PMID:17478558))T(3) regulates energy metabolism by stimulating metabolic rate and decreasing metabolic efficiency. The discovery of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), its homology to UCP1, and regulation by T(3) rendered it a possible molecular determinant of the action of T(3) on energy metabolism, but data are controversial. This controversy may in part be attributable to discrepancies observed between the regulation by T(3) of UCP3 expression in rats, humans, and mice. To clarify this issue, we studied 1) the induction kinetics of the UCP3 gene by T(3) in rat skeletal muscle, 2) the influence of fatty acids, and 3) the structure and regulation of the various UCP3 promoters by T(3). Within 8 h of single-dose T(3) administration, hypothyroid rats showed a rise in serum fatty acid levels concomitant with a rapid increase in UCP3 expression in gastrocnemius muscle, followed by inductions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) (within 24 h) and PPAR target gene expression (after 24 h). This T(3)-induced early UCP3 expression depended on fatty acid-PPAR signaling because depleting serum fatty acid levels abolished its expression, restorable by administration of the PPARdelta agonist L165,041 (4-[3-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)propoxy]phenoxy]acetic acid). In transfected rat L6 myoblasts, only the rat UCP3 promoter positively responded to T(3) and L165,041 together in the presence of MyoD, thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1), PPARdelta, or PPARdelta plus the TR dimerization partner retinoid X receptor alpha. All promoters share a response element common to TR and PPAR (TRE 1), but the observed species differences may be attributable to different localizations of the MyoD response element, which in the rat maps to exon 1.((PMID:16556763))Although physical interactions with other receptors have been reported, heterodimeric complexes of T(3) nuclear receptors (TR) with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are considered as major regulators of T(3) target gene expression. However, despite the potent T(3) influence in proliferating myoblasts, RXR isoforms are not expressed during proliferation, raising the question of the nature of the complex involved in TRalpha transcriptional activity. We have previously established that c-Jun induces TRalpha1 transcriptional activity in proliferating myoblasts not expressing RXR. This regulation is specific to the muscle lineage, suggesting the involvement of a muscle-specific factor. In this study, we found that MyoD expression in HeLa cells stimulates TRalpha1 activity, an influence potentiated by c-Jun coexpression. Similarly, in the absence of RXR, MyoD or c-Jun overexpression in myoblasts induces TRalpha1 transcriptional activity through a direct repeat 4 or an inverted palindrome 6 thyroid hormone response element. The highest rate of activity was recorded when c-Jun and MyoD were coexpressed. Using c-Jun-negative dominants, we established that MyoD influence on TRalpha1 activity needs c-Jun functionality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRalpha1 and MyoD physically interact in the hinge region of the receptor and the transactivation and basic helix loop helix domains of MyoD. RXR expression (spontaneously occurring at the onset of myoblast differentiation) in proliferating myoblasts abrogates these interactions. These data suggest that in the absence of RXR, TRalpha1 transcriptional activity in myoblasts is mediated through a complex including MyoD and c-Jun.((PMID:16322094))The regulation of gene expression by thyroid hormone (T3) involves binding of the hormone to nuclear receptors [thyroid hormone receptor (TR)] acting as T3-dependent transcription factors encoded by TRalpha (NR1A1) and TRbeta (NR1A2) genes. Several TRalpha variants have already been characterized, but only some of them display T3 binding activity. In this study, we have identified another transcript, TRalpha-DeltaE6, produced by alternative splicing with microexon 6b instead of exon 6. This splicing leads to the synthesis of a protein devoid of a hinge domain. The TRalpha-DeltaE6 transcript is detected in all mouse tissues tested. Although TRalpha-DeltaE6 did not bind DNA, its expression induced a TRalpha1 sequestration in the cytoplasm. Functional studies demonstrated that TRalpha-DeltaE6 inhibits the transcriptional activity of TRalpha1 and retinoic X receptor-alpha, but not of retinoic acid receptor-alpha. We also found that TRalpha-DeltaE6 efficiently decreased the ability of TRalpha to inhibit MyoD transcriptional activity during myoblast proliferation. Consequently, when overexpressed in myoblasts, it stimulated terminal differentiation. We suggest that this novel TRalpha variant may act as down regulator of overall T3 receptor activity, including its ability to repress MyoD transcriptional activity during myoblast proliferation.((PMID:12642900))Mammals have two major isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxyase (ACC). The 275 kDa beta-form (ACCbeta) is predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle while the 265 kDa alpha-form (ACCalpha) is the major isoform in lipogenic tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. ACCbeta is thought to control fatty acid oxidation by means of the ability of malonyl-CoA to inhibit carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase-1 (CPT-1), which is a rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. Previously, it was reported that MyoD and other muscle regulating factors (MRFs) up-regulate the expression of ACCbeta by interactions between these factors and several cis-elements of ACCbeta promoter. We described here that ACCbeta expression mediated by MRFs is regulated by retinoic acids. Endogenous expression of ACCbeta in differentiated H9C2 myotube was significantly increased by retinoic acid treatment. However, on transient transfection assay in H9C2 myoblast, ACCbeta promoter activity was suppressed by RXRalpha and more severely by RARalpha. These effects on ACCbeta expression in myoblasts and myotubes by RXRalpha and RARalpha seem to be mediated by their interactions with MRFs because no consensus sequence for RXRalpha and RARalpha has been found in ACCbeta promoter and retinoic acid receptors did not affect this promoter activities by itself. In transient transfection in NIH3T3 fibroblast, the activation of ACCbeta promoter by MyoD, main MRF in myoblast, was significantly suppressed by RARalpha and to a less extent by RXRalpha while the RXRalpha drastically augmented the activation by MRF4, major MRF in myotube. These results explained that retinoic acids differentially affected the action of MRFs according to their types and RXRalpha specially elevates the expression of muscle specific genes by stimulating the action of MRF4.((PMID:10234814))Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown in aggregates give rise to several different cell types, including cardiac muscle. Given the lack of cardiac muscle cell lines, ES cells can be a useful tool in the study of cardiac muscle differentiation. The laminin-binding integrin alpha 6 beta 1 exists in two different splice variant forms of the alpha chain (alpha 6A and alpha 6B), the alpha 6A form having been implicated as possibly playing a role in cardiac muscle development, based on its distribution pattern [4, 53]. In this study we characterise the ES cell model system in terms of the expression of the two different alpha 6 splice variants. We correlate their expression with that of muscle markers and the transcription factor GATA-4, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We confirm that alpha 6B is constitutively expressed by ES cells. In contrast, alpha 6A expression appears later and overlaps in time with a period when the muscle marker myosin light chain-2V (MLC-2V) is expressed, but no MyoD is present, which indicates the presence of cardiac muscle cells in the aggregates. We further show that GATA-4 is present at the same time. Culturing the aggregates under conditions that stimulate (transforming growth factor beta 1 supplement) or inhibit (TGF beta 1 plus 10(-9) M retinoic acid supplement) cardiac muscle differentiation does not lead to any qualitative differences in the timing of expression of these genes, but quantitative changes cannot be excluded. The TGF beta 1 supplement does, however, lead to a relatively greater expression of alpha 6A compared to alpha 6B than the TGF beta 1 plus 10(-9) M RA supplement after 6 days in culture, suggesting that alpha 6A expression is favoured under conditions that stimulate cardiac muscle differentiation. The switch towards alpha 6A expression in ES cell aggregates is paralleled by expression of the binding receptor for TGF beta (T beta RII). Stable expression of a mutated (dominant negative) T beta RII in ES cells, however, still resulted in (TGF beta-independent) upregulation of alpha 6A, demonstrating that these events were not causally related and that parallel or alternative regulatory pathways exist. The initial characterisation of differentiating ES cell aggregates in terms of alpha 6A integrin subunit expression suggests that this model system could be a valuable tool in the study of the role of the alpha 6A beta 1 integrin in cardiac muscle differentiation.((PMID:9559292))Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) are characterized by unique neoplastic cells demonstrating phenotypic diversity. By using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we have detected expression of various genes before and after differentiation induction with four different agents in four established MRT cell lines (TM87-16, STM91-01, TTC642, and TTC549). The agents used in this study were all-trans retinoic acid (RA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), interleukin-3, or interferon-gamma. Before and after induction, c-myc, IGF-II, IGF-I receptor, and IGF-II receptor were constitutively expressed by all four cell lines. The neurofilament medium-size (NF-M) was constitutively expressed by the TM87-16 and TTC642, and the S100 protein alpha subunit was expressed by TM87-16, TTC642, and TTC549. Chromogranin A was expressed by TM87-16 only after treatment with either TPA or RA. MyoD, N-myc, tyrosine hydroxylase, N-CAM, trkA, and the S100 protein beta subunit were not expressed by any cell line before or after induction with these agents. All the MRT cell lines in this study except TM87-16 were highly resistant to differentiation induction. The proliferating cells in TM87-16 and TTC642 expressed mRNA profiles characteristic of neuroectoderm.((PMID:7753622))COUP-TF II is an 'orphan steroid receptor' that binds a wide variety of AGGTCA repeats and represses thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoid dependent trans-activation; however, very little is known of its functional and/or developmental role during mammalian cell differentiation. T3 and retinoids have been demonstrated to promote terminal muscle differentiation via activation of the muscle specific myoD gene family (myoD, myogenin, myf-5 and MRF-4). The myoD gene family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages, repress proliferation, activate differentiation and the contractile phenotype. Hence, we investigated the expression and functional role of COUP-TF II during muscle differentiation. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts expressed COUP-TF II mRNA which was repressed when cells were induced to differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal. Concomitant with the decrease of COUP-TF II mRNA was the appearance of muscle specific mRNAs (e.g. myogenin, alpha-actin). We show that Escherichia coli expressed full length and truncated COUP-TF II bound in a sequence specific manner to the T3 response elements (TREs) in the myoD and myogenin regulatory HLH genes [Olson (1992) Dev. Biol. 154, 261-272]; and the TRE in the skeletal alpha-actin contractile protein gene. COUP-TF II diminished the homodimeric binding of the thyroid hormone receptor and the heterodimeric binding of thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptor complexes to these TREs. Constitutive over-expression of COUP-TF II cDNA in mouse C2C12 myogenic cells suppressed the levels of myoD mRNA and blocked the induction of myogenin mRNA, whereas constitutive expression of anti-sense COUP-TF II cDNA significantly increased the steady state levels of myoD mRNA and hyper-induced myogenin mRNA. These studies demonstrate for the first time (i) that COUP-TF II, functions as a physiologically relevant antagonistic regulator of myogenesis via direct effects on the myoD gene family and (ii) direct evidence for the developmental role of COUP-TF II during mammalian cell differentiation.((PMID:7874162))((PMID:8127707))Thyroid hormones are major determinants of skeletal muscle differentiation in vivo. Triiodo-L-thyronine treatment promotes terminal muscle differentiation and results in increased MyoD gene transcription in myogenic cell lines; furthermore myoD and fast myosin heavy chain gene expression are activated in rodent slow twitch muscle fibers (Molecular Endocrinology 6: 1185-1194, 1992; Development 118: 1137-1147, 1993). We have identified a T3 response element (TRE) in the mouse MyoD promoter between nucleotide positions -337 and -309 (5' CTGAGGTCAGTACAGGCTGGAGGAGTAGA 3'). This sequence conferred an appropriate T3 response to an enhancerless SV40 promoter. In vitro binding studies showed that the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR alpha) formed a heterodimeric complex, with either the retinoid X receptor alpha or gamma 1 isoforms (RXR alpha, RXR gamm), on the MyoD TRE that was specifically competed by other well characterised TREs and not by other response elements. Analyses of this heterodimer with a battery of steroid hormone response elements indicated that the complex was efficiently competed by a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif separated by 4 nucleotides as predicted by the 3-4-5 rule. EMSA experiments demonstrated that the nuclear factor(s) present in muscle cells that bound to the myoD TRE were constitutively expressed during myogenesis; this complex was competed by the myosin heavy chain, DR-4 and PAL-0 TREs in a sequence specific fashion. Western blot analysis indicated that TR alpha 1 was constitutively expressed during C2C12 differentiation. Mutagenesis of the myoD TRE indicated that the sequence of the direct repeats (AGGTCA) and the 4 nucleotide gap were necessary for efficient binding to the TR alpha/RXR alpha heterodimeric complex. In conclusion our data suggest that the TRE in the helix loop helix gene, myoD, is a target for the direct heterodimeric binding of TR alpha and RXR alpha/gamma. These results provide a molecular mechanism/model for the effects of triiodo-L-thyronine on in vitro myogenesis; the activation of myoD gene expression in the slow twitch fibres and the cascade of myogenic events regulated by thyroid hormone.((PMID:8318458))The leukocyte adhesion receptors M290 (alpha M290/beta 7) and LPAM-1 (alpha 4 beta 7) comprise the beta 7-subfamily of integrins, which are constitutively expressed on subsets of lymphocytes populating the mouse small intestine. They are induced de novo after in vitro activation of lymphocytes and hence may serve a more general role in inflammation. In order to understand how beta 7 integrins are regulated during an immune response, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of the beta 7 gene. Primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends identified one major transcriptional start site in a favourable context, which resembles the initiator of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Transfection assays with a luciferase reporter gene revealed that cell-specific expression in vitro was retained in a 292 bp sequence, which contained several consensus binding motifs for transcriptional factors preferentially expressed in cells of the lymphoid lineages. Multiple retinoic acid receptor sites for steroid/thyroid hormone receptors which typify the leukocyte cell adhesion molecule subset of integrins are present. The beta 7 promoter, like its alpha 4 chain partner, contains the E box core sequence CACCTG found within the muscle creatine kinase enhancer which binds MyoD in vitro. The number of potential DNA binding sites for transcriptional factors in the beta 7 promoter parallels the complex regulation of expression of M290 and LPAM-1 in inflammation and gut mucosal immunity.((PMID:11024001))The uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle. UCP-3 mRNA is expressed in cultured muscle cells (C2C12 or L6E9) only when differentiated, at which stage UCP-3 is highly induced by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Here we report that human UCP-3 promoter activity is dependent on MyoD and inducible by all trans-RA. The action of all trans-RA is increased by co-transfection with RA receptor (RAR). We have characterized the RA response element that controls the induction by RA in the 5' noncoding region of the UCP-3 gene. Deletion and point-mutation analysis of the hUCP-3 promoter led us to identify a direct-repeat element with one base-pair spacing (DR1) at position -71/-59 responsible for the induction by RA of the activity of the promoter. This DR1 element bound a nuclear protein complex from muscle cells that contain RAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In the absence of this element, the promoter became unresponsive to RA, but it was still dependent on MyoD. In conclusion, it has been established that UCP-3 gene promoter activity is dependent on MyoD, and the first regulatory pathway for UCP-3 gene promoter regulation has been recognized by identifying RA as a transcriptional activator of the gene.((PMID:9464546))In C2 myoblasts, retinoic acid (RA) is an efficient inducer of both growth arrest and differentiation. These RA effects are mediated through at least two classes of retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs), which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. To determine the role played by each RAR or RXR family in this model system, we have analysed the effects of RA in C2 myoblasts expressing a dominant negative RAR (dnRAR) or a dominant negative RXR (dnRXR). The stable expression of dnRAR or dnRXR in C2 cells delays the RA-induced growth arrest and differentiation, an effect which is more pronounced in C2-dnRXR myoblasts. Furthermore, the RA-inducible expression of MyoD gene is lost in C2-dnRXR but not in C2-dnRAR cells, indicating that each family of retinoid receptors RAR and RXR may regulate distinct subsets of RA-responsive genes. Finally, using C2 cell lines with different retinoid responsiveness, we provided evidence for a link between the RXR and MyoD families in the process of myogenic differentiation. These results illustrate a critical role for RA-receptors in RA-control of C2 myogenesis and provide tools for studying the function of RA and its receptors during vertebrate development.((PMID:8194491))Retinoids (all trans and 9-cis retinoic acid) are pleiotropic regulators of cell fate, and have been shown to regulate the expression of helix loop helix transcription factors (e.g MyoD, myogenin and Myf-5) that control myogenic differentiation. The effects of retinoids are mediated through the ligand dependent retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). We have found that the messenger RNA transcripts encoding RAR are repressed during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts while, conversely, RXR mRNA transcripts are induced in C2C12 myotubes. These results imply that RXRs, play a major regulatory role in differentiated muscle.((PMID:19814781))Understanding stem cell differentiation is essential for the future design of cell therapies. While retinoic acid (RA) is the most potent small molecule enhancer of skeletal myogenesis in stem cells, the stage and mechanism of its function has not yet been elucidated. Further, the intersection of RA with other signalling pathways that stimulate or inhibit myogenesis (such as Wnt and BMP4, respectively) is unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which RA enhances skeletal myogenesis and interacts with Wnt and BMP4 signalling during P19 or mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation.Treatment of P19 or mouse ES cells with low levels of RA led to an enhancement of skeletal myogenesis by upregulating the expression of the mesodermal marker, Wnt3a, the skeletal muscle progenitor factors Pax3 and Meox1, and the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) MyoD and myogenin. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, RA receptors (RARs) bound directly to regulatory regions in the Wnt3a, Pax3, and Meox1 genes and RA activated a beta-catenin-responsive promoter in aggregated P19 cells. In the presence of a dominant negative beta-catenin/engrailed repressor fusion protein, RA could not bypass the inhibition of skeletal myogenesis nor upregulate Meox1 or MyoD. Thus, RA functions both upstream and downstream of Wnt signalling. In contrast, it functions downstream of BMP4, as it abrogates BMP4 inhibition of myogenesis and Meox1, Pax3, and MyoD expression. Furthermore, RA downregulated BMP4 expression and upregulated the BMP4 inhibitor, Tob1. Finally, RA inhibited cardiomyogenesis but not in the presence of BMP4.RA can enhance skeletal myogenesis in stem cells at the muscle specification/progenitor stage by activating RARs bound directly to mesoderm and skeletal muscle progenitor genes, activating beta-catenin function and inhibiting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. Thus, a signalling pathway can function at multiple levels to positively regulate a developmental program and can function by abrogating inhibitory pathways. Finally, since RA enhances skeletal muscle progenitor formation, it will be a valuable tool for designing future stem cell therapies.((PMID:12399463))Betaglycan is a membrane-anchored proteoglycan co-receptor that binds transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) via its core protein and basic fibroblast growth factor through its glycosaminoglycan chains. In this study we evaluated the expression of betaglycan during the C(2)C(12) skeletal muscle differentiation. Betaglycan expression, as determined by Northern and Western blot, was up-regulated during the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mouse betaglycan gene promoter was cloned, and its sequence showed putative binding sites for SP1, Smad3, Smad4, muscle regulatory factor elements such as MyoD and MEF2, and retinoic acid receptor. Transcriptional activity of the mouse betaglycan promoter reporter was also up-regulated in differentiating C(2)C(12) cells. We found that MyoD, but not myogenin, stimulated this transcriptional activity even in the presence of high serum. Betaglycan promoter activity was increased by RA and inhibited by the three isoforms of TGF-beta. On the other hand, basic fibroblast growth factor, BMP-2, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, which are inhibitors of myogenesis, had little effect. In myotubes, up-regulated betaglycan was also detectable by TGF-beta affinity labeling and immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The latter indicated that betaglycan was localized both on the cell surface and in the ECM. Forced expression of betaglycan in C(2)C(12) myoblasts increases their responsiveness to TGF-beta2, suggesting that it performs a TGF-beta presentation function in this cell lineage. These results indicate that betaglycan expression is up-regulated during myogenesis and that MyoD and RA modulate its expression by a mechanism that is independent of myogenin.((PMID:9535553))The signal transduction mechanism coupled to angiotensin AT2 receptors is still a matter of debate. Based on the findings that AT2 receptor stimulation causes inhibition of proliferation, and that other antiproliferative agents such as transforming growth factor-beta, retinoic acid, and MyoD act via repression of immediate early gene (IEG) expression, this study was aimed at elucidating whether downregulation of IEG expression is also part of the AT2 receptor coupled signaling mechanism. Stimulation of angiotensin AT2 receptors in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 W following pretreatment with growth factors was able to counteract growth factor induced proliferation but not to repress growth factor induced c-fos and c-jun expression; neither did AT2 receptor stimulation cause an induction of c-fos expression. We conclude that, in contrast to other growth-inhibiting agents, the antiproliferative effect of angiotensin II via the AT2 receptor is not mediated by repression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun.((PMID:22192089))Bone repair is dependent on the presence of osteocompetent progenitors that are able to differentiate and generate new bone. Muscle is found in close association with orthopaedic injury, however its capacity to make a cellular contribution to bone repair remains ambiguous. We hypothesized that myogenic cells of the MyoD-lineage are able to contribute to bone repair.We employed a MyoD-Cre+:Z/AP+ conditional reporter mouse in which all cells of the MyoD-lineage are permanently labeled with a human alkaline phosphatase (hAP) reporter. We tracked the contribution of MyoD-lineage cells in mouse models of tibial bone healing.In the absence of musculoskeletal trauma, MyoD-expressing cells are limited to skeletal muscle and the presence of reporter-positive cells in non-muscle tissues is negligible. In a closed tibial fracture model, there was no significant contribution of hAP+ cells to the healing callus. In contrast, open tibial fractures featuring periosteal stripping and muscle fenestration had up to 50% of hAP+ cells detected in the open fracture callus. At early stages of repair, many hAP+ cells exhibited a chondrocyte morphology, with lesser numbers of osteoblast-like hAP+ cells present at the later stages. Serial sections stained for hAP and type II and type I collagen showed that MyoD-lineage cells were surrounded by cartilaginous or bony matrix, suggestive of a functional role in the repair process. To exclude the prospect that osteoprogenitors spontaneously express MyoD during bone repair, we created a metaphyseal drill hole defect in the tibia. No hAP+ staining was observed in this model suggesting that the expression of MyoD is not a normal event for endogenous osteoprogenitors.These data document for the first time that muscle cells can play a significant secondary role in bone repair and this knowledge may lead to important translational applications in orthopaedic surgery.

However, the function of the different RA receptors (RARs)--RARα, RARβ, and RARγ--is as yet unclear. We have used wild-type and transgenic zebrafish to examine the role of RARγ. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with an RARγ-specific agonist reduced somite formation and axial length, which was associated with a loss of hoxb13a expression and less-clear alterations in hoxc11a or myoD expression. Treatment with the RARγ agonist also disrupted formation of tissues arising from cranial neural crest, including cranial bones and anterior neural ganglia. There was a loss of Sox 9-immunopositive neural crest stem/progenitor cells in the same anterior regions. Pectoral fin outgrowth was blocked by RARγ agonist treatment. However, there was no loss of Tbx-5-immunopositive lateral plate mesodermal stem/progenitor cells and the block was reversed by agonist washout or by cotreatment with an RARγ antagonist. Regeneration of the caudal fin was also blocked by RARγ agonist treatment, which was associated with a loss of canonical Wnt signaling. This regenerative response was restored by agonist washout or cotreatment with the RARγ antagonist. These findings suggest that RARγ plays an essential role in maintaining stem/progenitor cells during embryonic development and tissue regeneration when the receptor is in its nonligated state.((PMID:19012474))P19 embryonic carcinoma cells resemble normal embryonic stem (ES) cells. They generate cardiac and skeletal myocytes in response to retinoic acid (RA) or oxytocin (OT). RA treatment followed by exposure to triiodothyronine (T3) and insulin induces ES cells differentiation into adipocytes and skeletomyocytes. On the other hand, OT (10(-7) M) was reported to inhibit 3T3 preadipocyte maturation. The present work was undertaken to determine whether P19 cells have an adipogenic potential that could be affected by OT. Cells were treated with RA (10(-6) M)/T3+insulin (adipogenic protocol) or 10(-7) M OT (cardiomyogenic protocol), and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, immunotechniques, and cytochemistry. Oil-Red-O staining and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and aP2 indicated the generation of adipocytes in cultures submitted to the adipogenic protocol. Contracting cells were also generated. Cells positive for sarcomeric actinin and negative for cardiac troponin inhibitor (cTpnI) indicated generation of skeletomyocytes, and cTpnI positive cells revealed generation of cardiomyocytes. Levels of cTpnI and of the skeletal marker MyoD were almost similar in both protocols, whereas no Oil-Red-O staining was associated with the cardiomyogenic protocol. Addition of 10(-7) M OT to the adipogenic protocol did not affect Oil-Red-O staining and PPARgamma expression. Interestingly, Oct3/4 pluripotency marker disappeared in the adipogenic protocol but remained expressed in the cardiomyogenic one. P19 cells thus have an adipogenic potential non affected by 10(-7) M OT. RA/T3+insulin combination generates a larger spectrum of mesodermal cell derivatives and is a more potent morphogenic treatment than OT. P19 cells could help investigating mechanisms of cell fate decision during development.((PMID:21673099))Skeletal muscle wasting is an important public health problem associated with aging, chronic disease, cancer, kidney dialysis, and HIV/AIDS. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-D3), the active form of vitamin D, is widely recognized for its regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in relation to bone development and maintenance and for its calcemic effects on target organs, such as intestine, kidney, and parathyroid glands. Emerging evidence has shown that vitamin D administration improves muscle performance and reduces falls in vitamin D-deficient older adults. However, little is known of the underlying mechanism or the role 1,25-D3 plays in promoting myogenic differentiation at the cellular and/or molecular level. In this study, we examined the effect of 1,25-D3 on myoblast cell proliferation, progression, and differentiation into myotubes. C(2)C(12) myoblasts were treated with 1,25-D3 or placebo for 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 d. Vitamin D receptor expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blottings and immunofluorescence. Expression of muscle lineage, pro- and antimyogenic, and proliferation markers was assessed by immunocytochemistry, PCR arrays, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blottings. Addition of 1,25-D3 to C(2)C(12) myoblasts 1) increased expression and nuclear translocation of the vitamin D receptor, 2) decreased cell proliferation, 3) decreased IGF-I expression, and 4) promoted myogenic differentiation by increasing IGF-II and follistatin expression and decreasing the expression of myostatin, the only known negative regulator of muscle mass, without changing growth differentiation factor 11 expression. This study identifies key vitamin D-related molecular pathways for muscle regulation and supports the rationale for vitamin D intervention studies in select muscle disorder conditions.((PMID:27018098))An adequate vitamin D status is essential to optimize muscle strength. However, whether vitamin D directly reduces muscle fiber atrophy or stimulates muscle fiber hypertrophy remains subject of debate. A mechanism that may affect the role of vitamin D in the regulation of muscle fiber size is the local conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2 D by 1α-hydroxylase. Therefore, we investigated in a murine C2C12 myoblast culture whether both 1,25(OH)2 D3 and 25(OH)D3 affect myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and myotube size and whether these cells are able to metabolize 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2 D3 . We show that myoblasts not only responded to 1,25(OH)2 D3 , but also to the precursor 25(OH)D3 by increasing their VDR mRNA expression and reducing their proliferation. In differentiating myoblasts and myotubes 1,25(OH)2 D3 as well as 25(OH)D3 stimulated VDR mRNA expression and in myotubes 1,25(OH)2 D3 also stimulated MHC mRNA expression. However, this occurred without notable effects on myotube size. Moreover, no effects on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as well as MyoD and myogenin mRNA levels were observed. Interestingly, both myoblasts and myotubes expressed CYP27B1 and CYP24 mRNA which are required for vitamin D3 metabolism. Although 1α-hydroxylase activity could not be shown in myotubes, after treatment with 1,25(OH)2 D3 or 25(OH)D3 myotubes showed strongly elevated CYP24 mRNA levels compared to untreated cells. Moreover, myotubes were able to convert 25(OH)D3 to 24R,25(OH)2 D3 which may play a role in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. These data suggest that skeletal muscle is not only a direct target for vitamin D3 metabolites, but is also able to metabolize 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2 D3 . J. Cell.

However, the effects of vitamin D and AGEs on myogenesis and the interaction between muscle and bone remains still unclear. We previously showed that osteoglycin (OGN) is secreted from myoblasts and stimulates osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting that it plays important roles in the interaction between muscle and bone. The aim of this study is thus to examine the effects of vitamin D and AGEs on myoblastic differentiation of C2C12 cells and osteoblastic differentiation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells through OGN expression. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) and eldecalcitol, an active vitamin D analog, induced the expression of MyoD, myogenin and OGN, and these effects were abolished by vitamin D receptor (VDR) suppression by siRNA in C2C12 cells. Moreover, conditioned medium from 1,25D-pretreated C2C12 cells stimulated the expression of type 1 collagen and alkaline phosphatase in MC3T3-E1 cells, compared to control medium from 1,25D-untreated C2C12 cells. In contrast, conditioned medium from VDR-suppressed and 1,25D-pretreated C2C12 cells showed no effects. AGE2 and AGE3 suppressed the expression of MyoD, myogenin and OGN in C2C12 cells. Moreover, 1,25D blunted the AGEs' effects. In conclusion, these findings showed for the first time that active vitamin D plays important roles in myogenesis and muscle-induced osteoblastogenesis through OGN expression. Active vitamin D treatment may rescue the AGEs-induced sarcopenia as well as - suppressed osteoblastic differentiation via OGN expression in myoblasts.((PMID:15775165))Patients with vitamin D insufficiency often exhibit muscle weakness and/or atrophy which can be cured by vitamin D and Ca supplementation. However, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. The direct effects of vitamin D on skeletal muscle cells include induction of transcription factors such as c-myc (genomic action) ;and activation of Ca channels, Src tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase (non-genomic action). Recent studies on VDR gene knockout mice revealed that VDR also regulates expression of the MyoD family of transcription factors in skeletal muscle. Thus, vitamin D and Ca appear to regulate proliferation, maturation and function of skeletal muscle through these complex actions.((PMID:8614403))Rev-erbA alpha is an orphan steroid receptor that is expressed in skeletal muscle. Rev-erbA alpha binds to single/tandem copies of an AGGTCA motif, is transcribed on the noncoding strand of the c-erbA- alpha gene locus, and is postulated to modulate the thyroid hormone (T3) response. T3 induces terminal muscle differentiation and regulates fiber type composition via direct activation of the muscle-specific myoD gene family (e.g. myoD, myogenin). The myoD gene family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages and activate muscle differentiation. Hence we investigated the expression and physiological role of Rev-erbA alpha during myogenesis. We observed abundant levels of Rev-erbA alpha mRNA in dividing C2C12 myoblasts, which were suppressed when the cells differentiated into postmitotic multinucleated myotubes. This decrease in Rev-erbA alpha mRNA correlated with the appearance of muscle-specific mRNAs (e.g. myogenin and alpha-actin). Constitutive overexpression of full length Rev-erbA alpha cDNA in the myogenic cells completely abolished differentiation, suppressed myoD mRNA levels, and abrogated the induction of myogenin mRNA. We then demonstrated that 1) GAL4-REV-erbA alpha chimeras that contain the 'AB' region and lack the 'E' region activated transcription of GAL4 response elements in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP and 2) the ligand-binding domain (LBD) contains an active transcriptional silencer. Overexpression of Rev-erbA alpha (delta AB) in myogenic cells had no impact on the ability of these cells to morphologically or biochemically differentiate. Furthermore, this orphan receptor 1) down-regulated thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/T3 mediated transcriptional activity from the myogenin promoter and thyroid hormone response element (TRE) an 2) disrupted TR homodimer and TR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer formation on a number of TREs found in the myoD gene family. In conclusion, Rev-erbA alpha functions as a negative regulator of myogenesis by targeting the expression of the myoD gene family. The mechanism of action may involve inhibition of functional TR/RXR heterodimer formation on critical TREs and dominant trans-repression of gene expression.((PMID:15862566))The zebrafish fushi tarazu factor-1a (ff1a) is a transcription factor belonging to the NR5A subgroup of nuclear receptors. The NR5A receptors bind DNA as monomers and are considered to be orphans due to their ability to promote transcription of downstream genes without ligands. In zebrafish, four ff1 homologues (Ff1a, Ff1b, Ff1c, and Ff1d) have been identified so far. The gene coding for Ff1a is driven by two separate promoters, and give rise to four splice variants. Ff1a is expressed in the somites and pronephric ducts during somitogenesis and in the brain, liver, and mandibular arch during later embryonic stages. In adults the gene is highly expressed in gonads, liver, and intestine, but can be detected in most tissues. The broad variety of embryonic expression domains indicates several important developmental features. One of the mammalian fushi tarazu factor-1 genes, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), is essential for the development of gonads and adrenals. SF-1 is together with Sox9, WT1, and GATA4 a positive transcriptional regulator of human anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and thereby linked to the male sex-determining pathway. The zebrafish ff1a dual promoter contains several GATA binding sites and E-boxes, a site for DR4, XFD2, MyoD, Snail, HNF3, S8, and an HMG-box recognition site for Sox9. In a first attempt to dissect the ff1a promoter in vivo we have produced first generation transgenes in order to determine the correlation between the expression of the endogenous ff1a gene and the microinjected ff1a dual promoter coupled to the pEGFP reporter vector. Our results show that the microinjected constructs are expressed in the correct tissues.((PMID:27673705))Agastache rugosa (Fisch. & C. A. Mey.) Kuntze has been well known for its antioxidative properties. In this study, we investigated the antimelanogenesis effect of demethyleugenol β-D-glucopyranoside (1) from Agastache rugosa by studying molecular regulation of melanogenesis in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) and in in vivo models. The SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome)-related high-mobility group (HMG) box 9 (SOX9), one of critical factors that affect skin pigmentation is up-regulated. Interestingly, 1 downregulated the expression of SOX9 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Reduction of these two transcription factors resulted in a decrease in melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1, and dopachrome tautomerase. As a result, 1 significantly inhibited the melanin synthesis in melan-a mouse melanocytes and NHEMs. In addition, the antimelanogenic effect of 1 was confirmed in the zebrafish and reconstructed skin tissue models. In conclusion, 1, as a potent SOX9 regulator ameliorates skin pigmentation.((PMID:27663623))The cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12) has been implicated as a potent stimulator of tissue degradation in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis. In patients with periodontitis, an increased level of IL-12 is found in serum and gingival crevicular fluid. As inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated to induce activation of the immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), this study aimed to investigate the influence of IL-12 on these properties in human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells.Human PDL cells were isolated from periodontal tissue and incubated with 0-10 ng/mL of IL-12 for 24 h. The levels of expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), as well as of the stem cell markers, CD73, CD90 and CD105, were assessed by quantitative PCR. The level of IFN-γ protein was measured by ELISA, and IDO activity was measured by activity assay. The participation of IFN-γ in the expression of IDO and HLA-G was analyzed using neutralizing antibody against IFN-γ.IL-12 upregulated the expression of IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-12 induced the expression of the immunomodulatory proteins IDO and HLA-G via an IFN-γ-dependent pathway, as indicated by experiments using an IFN-γ neutralizing antibody. Addition of exogenous IFN-γ upregulated the expression of HLA-G and IDO. Expression of the stem cell markers CD73, CD90 and CD105, as well as the pluripotent markers Nanog homeobox, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY-box 2, were also upregulated in IL-12-treated hPDL cells. Finally, IL-12 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of the hPDL cells and preserved the self-clonal expansion property of these cells, as assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and the colony-forming unit assay.Expression of IL-12 during periodontitis may play an important role in the control of the inflammatory response via the induction of immunosuppressive molecules by hPDL cells. We hypothesize that this immunomodulatory property of IL-12 will serve as a protective mechanism to preserve a population of stem cells under inflammatory conditions.((PMID:27656215))Purpose. To track the fate of micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) labeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo in a rat myocardial infarction model using 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Materials and Methods. Male MSCs (2 × 10(6)/50 μL) dual-labeled with MPIO and CM-DiI were injected into the infarct periphery 7 days after myocardial infarction (MI). The control group received cell-free media injection. The temporal stem cell location, signal intensity, and cardiac function were dynamically assessed using a 7T MRI at 24 h before transplantation (baseline), 3 days, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after transplantation, respectively. Results. MR hypointensities caused by MPIOs were observed on T2(⁎)-weighted images at all time points after MSCs injection. Cine-MRI showed that MSCs moderated progressive left ventricular remodeling. Double staining for iron and CD68 revealed that most of the iron-positive cells were CD68-positive macrophages. Real-time PCR for rat SRY gene showed the number of survival MSCs considerably decreased after transplantation. MSC-treated hearts had significantly increased capillary density in peri-infarct region and lower cardiomyocytes apoptosis and fibrosis formation. Conclusions. Iron particles are not a reliable marker for in vivo tracking the long-term fate of MSCs engraftment. Despite of poor cell retention, MSCs moderate left ventricular remodeling after MI.((PMID:27654689))Accurate mouse sexing is vital when conducting research examining sexual dimorphisms. Late fetal and newborn mouse pups are more immature than many previously described sexing methods allow. This study compares the sexing accuracy of a newly described internal gonad sexing method to a recently described peritoneal pigmentation sexing method in embryonic day 20 C57BL/6J mouse pups, using Sry genotyping to confirm the sex. The internal gonad sexing method was found to be highly accurate, while the peritoneal pigmentation method was slightly less accurate. Therefore, while Sry genotyping remains the gold standard, immediate and less expensive sexing methods can be performed accurately as early as the late fetal period in C57BL/6J mice.((PMID:27648416))In Algeria, the data on infertility and its various causes are rare. Recently, the introduction of assisted reproduction has allowed expecting that 300000 couples, which represent 7% of couples of reproductive age, face difficulty conceiving a child. Knowing that most idiopathic cases are likely to be due to chromosomal abnormalities, we aimed to investigate genetic defects by karyotype analysis in Algerian infertile men, using peripheral blood lymphocytes.A cytogenetic study was conducted on 10 men from infertile couples by Karyotype analysis of R-banding performed by lymphocyte culture technique. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed and molecular abnormalities were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were evaluated by immunoradiometric method.Chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 30% of the patients. We identified a homogenous Klinefelter syndrome patient with 47, XXY karyotype, a mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patient with 47, XXY/46, XY karyotype and a 46, XX male. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the sex-determining region Y was translocated to the short arm of the X chromosome in patient with 46, XX chromosomal constitution and the presence of the SRY gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis.The occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities in 30% of the infertile men strongly supports the inclusion of routine cytogenetic testing for diagnostic establishment and suitable counseling for couples seeking for assisted reproduction technologies.((PMID:27644460))Lissencephaly is one of the central nervous system anomalies of Miller-Dieker Syndrome (MDS). Fetuses with lissencephaly have an abnormal smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves which will be detected by ultrasounds or fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 30 weeks of gestation. We report a fetus with lissencephaly diagnosed as Miller-Dieker syndrome postnatally.

Fetal delayed cortical development will be the findings to perform further investigations including FISH analysis for MDS, a 17p13.3 microdeletion syndrome, pre/postnatally. This will be the first case of MDS with unbalanced translocation between deleted short arm of chromosome 17 and Y chromosome.((PMID:27643851))Macaca fascicularis fascicularis is distributed over a wide area of Southeast Asia. Thailand is located at the center of their distribution range and is the bridge connecting the two biogeographic regions of Indochina and Sunda. However, only a few genetic studies have explored the macaques in this region. To shed some light on the evolutionary history of M. f. fascicularis, including hybridization with M. mulatta, M. f. fascicularis and M. mulatta samples of known origins throughout Thailand and the vicinity were analyzed by molecular phylogenetics using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including the hypervariable region 1, and Y-chromosomal DNA, including SRY and TSPY genes. The mtDNA phylogenetic analysis divided M. f. fascicularis into five subclades (Insular Indonesia, Sundaic Thai Gulf, Vietnam, Sundaic Andaman sea coast, and Indochina) and revealed genetic differentiation between the two sides of the Thai peninsula, which had previously been reported as a single group of Malay peninsular macaques. From the estimated divergence time of the Sundaic Andaman sea coast subclade, it is proposed that after M. f. fascicularis dispersed throughout Southeast Asia, some populations on the south-easternmost Indochina (eastern Thailand, southern Cambodia and southern Vietnam at the present time) migrated south-westwards across the land bridge, which was exposed during the glacial period of the late Pleistocene epoch, to the southernmost Thailand/northern peninsular Malaysia. Then, some of them migrated north and south to colonize the Thai Andaman sea coast and northern Sumatra, respectively. The SRY-TSPY phylogenetic analysis suggested that male-mediated gene flow from M. mulatta southward to M. f. fascicularis was restricted south of, but close to, the Isthmus of Kra. There was a strong impact of the geographical factors in Thailand, such as the Isthmus of Kra, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Phuket ranges and Sundaland, on M. f. fascicularis biogeography and their hybridization with M. mulatta.((PMID:27641728))The aim of the present study was to prove that primary cells enriched with stem cells are more easily reprogrammed to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells than those with scarce numbers of stem cells.We surveyed the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in five primarily-isolated human deciduous teeth-derived dental pulp cells (HDDPC) with cytochemical staining to examine the possible presence of stem cells. Next, the expression of stemness-specific factors, such as OCT(Octumer-binding transcription factor)3/4, NANOG, SOX2(SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2), CD90, muscle segment homeodomain homeobox (MSX) 1, and MSX2, was assessed with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Finally, these isolated HDDPC were transfected with plasmids carrying genes coding Yamanaka factors to determine whether these cells could be reprogrammed to generate iPS cells.Of the five primarily-isolated HDDPC, two (HDDPC-1 and -5) exhibited higher degrees of ALP activity. OCT-3/4 expression was also prominent in those two lines. Furthermore, these two lines proliferated faster than the other three lines. The transfection of HDDPC with Yamanaka factors resulted in the generation of iPS cells from HDDPC-1 and -5.The number of cells with the stemness property of HDDPC differs among individuals, which suggests that HDDPC showing an increased expression of both ALP and OCT-3/4 can be more easily reprogrammed to generate iPS cells after the forced expression of reprogramming factors.((PMID:27638301))Histone acetylation regulated by class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a pivotal role in matrix-specific gene transcription and cartilage development. While we previously demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-455-3p is upregulated during chondrogenesis and can enhance early chondrogenesis, the mechanism underlying this process remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the effect of miR-455-3p on histone H3 acetylation and its role during cartilage development and degeneration. We observed that miR-455-3p was highly expressed in proliferating and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, while HDAC2 and HDAC8 were primarily expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Meanwhile, miR-455-3p suppressed the activity of reporter constructs containing the 3'-untranslated regions of HDAC2/8, inhibited HDAC2/8 expression and promoted histone H3 acetylation at the collagen 2 (COL2A1) promoter in human SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in increased expression of cartilage-specific genes and promoted glycosaminoglycan deposition. Moreover, TSA inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) expression and promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 in interleukin-1-treated primary mouse chondrocytes. Lastly, knockdown of HDAC2/3/8 increased SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9) and decreased Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-455-3p plays a critical role during chondrogenesis by directly targeting HDAC2/8 and promoting histone H3 acetylation, which raises possibilities of using miR-455-3p to influence chondrogenesis and cartilage degeneration.((PMID:27635402))Objectives. To investigate whether high glucose-induced oxidative stress is implicated in apoptosis of rat nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and abnormal expression of critical genes involved in the metabolic balance of extracellular matrix (ECM). Methods. NPCs were cultured with various concentrations of glucose to detect cell viability and apoptosis. Cells cultured with high glucose (25 mM) were untreated or pretreated with N-acetylcysteine or a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated. Activation of p38 MAPK was measured by Western blot. The expression of ECM metabolism-related genes, including type II collagen, aggrecan, SRY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (Sox-9), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Results. High glucose reduced viability of NPCs and induced apoptosis. High glucose resulted in increased ROS generation and p38 MAPK activation. In addition, it negatively regulated the expression of type II collagen, aggrecan, Sox-9, and TIMP-1 and positively regulated MMP-3 expression. These results were changed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine or SB 202190. Conclusions. High glucose might promote apoptosis of NPCs, trigger ECM catabolic pathways, and inhibit its anabolic activities, possibly through a p38 MAPK-dependent oxidative stress mechanism.((PMID:27634221))SRY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (Sox9) gene is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation. In this study, we identified the transcriptional factor ZNF606 as an interacting partner for Sox9 in cells. We further demonstrated that overexpression of ZNF606 inhibited the transcriptional activity of Sox9, while knockdown of ZNF606 increased Sox9-mediated transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ZNF606 prevents Sox9 binding to the enhancers of its target gene col2a1. Importantly, the interaction between ZNF606 and Sox9 was decreased during chondrocyte differentiation. Consistent with these findings, ZNF606 inhibited chondrocyte differentiation. Thus, our results demonstrate that ZNF606 acts as a novel Sox9 co-regulator that inhibits Sox9-mediated chondrocyte differentiation.((PMID:27627724))To establish a rabbit model for investigating the effects of intermittent cyclic mechanical tension (ICMT) on promoting degeneration of endplate cartilage.Forty New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to surgery and randomly divided into three equal groups as follows: control group (no treatment, n = 10), sham group (animals underwent a sham operation but were not subjected to mechanical tensile strain, n = 15) and loaded group (discs were subjected to 1.5 MPa external tensile loading by using an external loading device during the animals' daily activity, n = 15). Mechanical tensile strain was applied for 8 h/d. The animals were examined radiologically after 8 weeks treatment and then killed for removal of endplate cartilage tissue samples from their spines. Histological staining was performed to examine the morphology of endplate cartilage tissue. Multiple strategies were employed to examine degeneration of endplate cartilage and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway activation.After ICMT loading for 56 days, radiology revealed ossification, hyperosteogeny and stenosis in the intervertebral spaces. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin staining of sections of endplate cartilage showed significant damage as the load duration increased in the ICMT loading group. Expression of aggrecan (ACAN), type II collagen (COL-2A), SRY-related high mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX9) was down-regulated (FACAN = 21.515, P < 0.01; FCOL-2A = 6.670, P = 0.05; FSOX9 = 7.888, P < 0.05), whereas that of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) was up-regulated (FMMP13 = 14.120, P < 0.01) after ICMT. Western blot and immunofluorescence revealed that expression of protein was consistent with gene expression results. Additionally, ICMT loading can lead to NF-κB signaling pathway activation as well as degeneration of endplate cartilage.These experiments indicate that ICMT contributes to the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and that the NF-κB signaling pathway further up-regulates MMP13, leading to degeneration of endplate cartilage.((PMID:27611865))Selenium toxicity to oviparous vertebrates is often attributed to selenomethionine (SeMet), which can biomagnify through maternal transfer. Although oxidative stress is implicated in SeMet toxicity, knowledge gaps remain in how SeMet causes characteristic spinal deformities. In the present study, we use the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) model to investigate the role of oxidative stress, cell death, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) on skeletal gene expression and SeMet toxicity, linking localization of cellular effects to observed abnormalities. Medaka embryos were treated with 2.5μM or 5μM SeMet for 24h at stage 25 (48h post fertilization). Post treatment, embryos were separated into normal, deformed (mild, moderate or severe), or dead categories. Dichlorofluorescein staining demonstrated oxidative stress in tails of embryos with observable spinal malformations. Furthermore, acridine orange staining for apoptosis identified significantly more dead cells in tails of treated embryos. Gene expression studies for the UPR suggest a potential role for CHOP (c/ebp homologous protein) induced apoptosis deformed embryos after 5μM SeMet, accompanied by a significant decrease in PDIA4 (protein disulfide isomerase A4) and no change in Dnajb9 (ER DNA J Domain-Containing Protein 4). This expression was distinct from the UPR induced by well-studied ER stress inducer, tunicamycin, which robustly activated CHOP, PDIA4 and Dnajb9. Finally, SeMet treatment significantly decreased transcripts of cartilage development, Sox9 (SRY box 9), while increasing Runx2 in deformed embryos, without altering Twist or Collagen 2a1. Results suggest that oxidative stress, the UPR and cell death play key roles in SeMet induced deformities and altered skeletal development factors.((PMID:27611740))The sex-determining gene SRY induces SOX9 expression in the testes of eutherian mammals via two pathways. SRY binds to testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 (TESCO) with SF1 to activate SOX9 transcription. SRY also up-regulates ER71 expression, and ER71 activates Sox9 transcription. After the initiation of testis differentiation, SOX9 enhances Amh expression by binding to its promoter with SF1. SOX8, SOX9 and SOX10, members of the SOXE gene family, also enhance the activities of the Amh promoter and TESCO. In this study, we investigated the regulation of these sexual differentiation genes in Tokudaia osimensis, which lacks a Y chromosome and the SRY gene. The activity of the AMH promoter was stimulated by SOXE genes and SF1. Mutant AMH promoters, with mutations in its SOX and SF1 binding sites, did not show significant activity by SOX9 and SF1. These results indicate that AMH expression was regulated by the binding of SOX9 and SF1. By contrast, SOXE genes could not enhance TESCO activity. These results indicate that TESCO enhancer activity was lost in this species. Furthermore, the activity of the SOX9 promoter was enhanced by ER71, indicating that ER71 may play an important role in the testis-specific expression of SOX9.((PMID:27604691))In a 46 XY individual, the presence of the Y chromosome harboring the testis-determining factor (SRY) triggers testis determination and differentiation. In a 46 XX individual, the absence of SRY and the activation of genes associated with the female pathway lead to ovarian development. The latter process has long been considered as a default pathway. However, recent studies have cast doubts on this dogma. Here, after a brief overview of the main steps of ovarian development, we focus on three genes WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 that are essential for ovarian determination, differentiation and/or maintenance. Special attention is paid to FOXL2 whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis syndrome, often associated with female infertility, and for cancer. We highlight the cooperation of WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 within a regulatory network and the need for further research to better understand their role in defining and maintaining ovarian identity.((PMID:27592376))A novel color-tunable phosphor Sr3Y(PO4)3:Ce(3+),Tb(3+) was synthesized through solid-state reaction method. Several techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, were used to investigate the obtained phosphors. Results of luminescence spectra and decay time measurements revealed that an efficient energy transfer occurred from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) via a dipole-dipole mechanism, where Ce(3+) exhibited a strong excitation band in the near-ultraviolet region. CIE chromaticity coordinates were tuned from deep blue (0.162, 0.090) to green (0.230, 0.411) by adjusting the relative concentrations between Ce(3+) and Tb(3+) ions. Results revealed that the as-synthesized phosphors had color-tunable characteristics and can be used as promising materials in the field of phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes.((PMID:27588041))Constitutional translocations between sex chromosomes are rather rare in humans with breakpoints at Xp11 and Yq11 as the most frequent. Breakpoints on the short arm of the Y chromosome form one subgroup of t(X;Y), giving rise to a derived chromosome with the centromeres of both the X and Y chromosomes, dic(X;Y). Here, we report a rare congenital chromosomal aberration, 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32)[20]/45,X[10], in an adult male.Primary myelofibrosis, a malignant haematological disease, was diagnosed in a 63-year-old man following liver transplantation after hepatocellular carcinoma. By the analysis of the bone marrow sample, the karyotype 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32) was detected in all the mitoses analysed and verified with multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH). A cytogenetic examination of stimulated peripheral blood cells revealed the constitutional karyotype 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32)[20]/45,X[10]. The cell line 45,X was confirmed with FISH in 35 % of interphase nuclei. The SRY locus was present on the dicentric chromosome. A CGH/SNP array (Illumina) revealed a gain of 153,7 Mbp of the X chromosome and a 803-kbp microdeletion (including the SHOX gene), which were also confirmed with FISH. SHOX encodes a transcriptional factor that regulates the growth of the long bones. The deletion of the SHOX gene together with the Madelung deformity of the forearm and the short stature of the proband led to a diagnosis of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD). The gain of almost the whole X chromosome (153,7 Mbp) was considered a variant of Klinefelter syndrome (KS). The levels of gonadotropins and testosterone were consistent with gonadal dysfunction. A malformation of the right external ear was detected.We have reported a structural aberration of the sex chromosomes, dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32). The related genomic imbalance is associated with two known hereditary syndromes, LWD and a KS variant, identified in our proband at an advanced age. Because the breakpoints did not involve cancer genes, we inferred that the two malignancies in the proband were not caused by this abnormality. The possible influence of SHOX haploinsufficiency on the growth regulation of auricular chondrocytes is discussed.((PMID:27578009))Tissue engineering-based therapies rely on the delivery of monolayered fibroblasts on two-dimensional polystyrene-coated and extracellular matrix (ECM) surfaces to regenerate connective tissues. However, this approach may fail to mimic their three-dimensional (3D) native architecture and function. We hypothesize that ECM fibrous proteins, which direct the migration of cells in vivo, may attach and guide polystyrene- and Matrigel™-ECM (M-ECM)-adherent fibroblasts to rearrangement into large multicellular macrostructures with the ability to proliferate. Gingival monolayered fibroblasts and their derived spheroids were added and adhered to tissue culture polystyrene and M-ECM surfaces. The cells were covered with a layer of collagen1 hydrogel combined with vitronectin, fibronectin or fibrin, or 10% M-ECM. The development of 3D cell constructs was characterized by epifluorescence and confocal scanning microscope image analysis. The ECM turnover and the proliferative capabilities of the fibroblasts were determined via gene expression profiling of collagen1, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase/metallopeptidase 2, Nanog, and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box2 (Sox2). Expression of the Sox2 protein was followed by immunostaining. The collagen1 protein had the strongest effect on monolayered and spheroid cell rearrangements, forming large spherical shapes and fused 3D macroconstructs. The addition of fibrin protein was typically required to achieve a similar effect on M-ECM-adherent monolayered fibroblasts. The spheroid fusion process was followed by an increase in cell density and the formation of tight clusters. The fused spheroids continued to maintain their intracellular ECM turnover and proliferation capacities. Collagen1 is a valuable component in the rearrangement of adherent fibroblast monolayers and spheroids. Fibroblast spheroids should preferably be used as basic building blocks to assemble multicellular connective tissue-like macrostructures.((PMID:27576690))A general problem is posed by analysis of transcriptional thresholds governing cell-fate decisions in metazoan development. A model is provided by testis determination in therian mammals. Its key step-Sertoli-cell differentiation in the embryonic gonadal ridge-is initiated by SRY, a Y-encoded architectural transcription factor. Mutations in human SRY cause gonadal dysgenesis leading to XY female development (Swyer syndrome). Here, we have characterized an inherited mutation compatible with either male or female somatic phenotypes as respectively observed in an XY father and XY daughter. The mutation (a crevice-forming substitution at a conserved back surface of the SRY high-mobility-group box) markedly destabilizes the domain but preserves specific DNA affinity and induced DNA bend angle. On transient transfection of diverse human and rodent cell lines, the variant SRY exhibited accelerated proteasomal degradation (relative to wild-type) associated with increased ubiquitination; in vitro susceptibility to ubiquitin-independent (″default″) cleavage by the 20S core proteasome was unchanged. The variant's gene-regulatory activity (as assessed in a cellular model of the rat embryonic XY gonadal ridge) was reduced by twofold relative to wild-type SRY at similar levels of mRNA expression. Chemical proteasome inhibition restored native-like SRY expression and transcriptional activity in association with restored occupancy of a sex-specific enhancer element in principal downstream gene Sox9, demonstrating that the variant SRY exhibits essentially native activity on a per-molecule basis. Our findings define a novel mechanism of impaired organogenesis: accelerated ubiquitin-directed proteasomal degradation of a master transcription factor leading to a developmental decision poised at the edge of ambiguity.((PMID:27563746))In this commentary we briefly summarize early work on circular RNAs derived from spliceosome mediated circularization. We highlight how this early work inspired work on the basic mechanisms of nuclear RNA splicing, the possible function of circular RNAs and the potential uses of circular RNAs as tools in biomedicine. Recent developments in the study of circular RNAs, summarized in this volume, have brought these questions back to the foreground.((PMID:27536700))The SRY gene (SRY) provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In this study, SRY of 15 spices included of human, chimpanzee, dog, pig, rat, cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, horse, zebra, frog, urial, dolphin and killer whale were used for determine of bioinformatic differences.Nucleotide sequences of SRY were retrieved from the NCBI databank. Bioinformatic analysis of SRY is done by CLC Main Workbench version 5.5 and ClustalW (http:/www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and MEGA6 softwares.The multiple sequence alignment results indicated that SRY protein sequences from Orcinus orca (killer whale) and Tursiopsaduncus (dolphin) have least genetic distance of 0.33 in these 15 species and are 99.67% identical at the amino acid level. Homosapiens and Pantroglodytes (chimpanzee) have the next lowest genetic distance of 1.35 and are 98.65% identical at the amino acid level.These findings indicate that the SRY proteins are conserved in the 15 species, and their evolutionary relationships are similar.((PMID:27264816))To investigate the phenotype-genotype association of isodicentromere Y chromosome by analysis of two female patients carrying the chromosome with sexual development disorders.The karyotypes of the two patients were determined by application of conventional G banding of peripheral blood samples and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR was applied to detect the presence of SRY gene.Conventional karyotype analysis showed case 1 to be a mosaic: mos.45,X[38]/46,X,+mar[151]/47,XY,+mar[5]/47,X,+mar × 2[2]/46,XY[4], FISH showed that 12 different cell lines were presented in the karyotype of case 1 and partial cell lines with SRY gene, the marker is an isodicentromere Y chromosome [idic(Y)(p)]. No mutation was found in the SRY gene. The karyotype of case 2 was mos.45,X[25]/46,X,+mar[35]. FISH showed the marker to be an idic(Y)(p) without the SRY gene.The karyotype of patients carrying idic(Y)(p) seems unstable, and female patients have the characteristics of short stature and secondary sexual hypoplasia. Karyotype analysis combined with FISH analysis can accurately determine the breakpoint of idic(Y) and identify the types of complex mosaic, which may facilitate genetic counseling and prognosis.((PMID:26823431))The mammalian Y chromosome is considered a symbol of maleness, as it encodes a gene driving male sex determination, Sry, as well as a battery of other genes important for male reproduction. We previously demonstrated in the mouse that successful assisted reproduction can be achieved when the Y gene contribution is limited to only two genes, Sry and spermatogonial proliferation factor Eif2s3y. Here, we replaced Sry by transgenic activation of its downstream target Sox9, and Eif2s3y, by transgenic overexpression of its X chromosome-encoded homolog Eif2s3x. The resulting males with no Y chromosome genes produced haploid male gametes and sired offspring after assisted reproduction. Our findings support the existence of functional redundancy between the Y chromosome genes and their homologs encoded on other chromosomes.((PMID:26719889))Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process allowing for a formation of a mature male gamete. During its final phase, spermiogenesis, haploid round spermatids undergo cellular differentiation into spermatozoa, which involves extensive restructuring of cell morphology, DNA, and epigenome. Using mouse models with abrogated Y chromosome gene complements and Y-derived transgene we identified Y chromosome encoded Zfy2 as the gene responsible for sperm formation and function. In the presence of a Zfy2 transgene, mice lacking the Y chromosome and transgenic for two other Y-derived genes, Sry driving sex determination and Eif2s3y initiating spermatogenesis, are capable of producing sperm which when injected into the oocytes yield live offspring. Therefore, only three Y chromosome genes, Sry, Eif2s3y and Zfy2, constitute the minimum Y chromosome complement compatible with successful intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the mouse.((PMID:26672550))((PMID:26651950))Simple and precise methods for sex determination in animals are a pre-requisite for a number of applications in animal production and forensics. Some of the existing methods depend only on the detection of Y-chromosome specific sequences. However, the detection of Y and X-chromosome specific sequences is advantageous. In the present study the accuracy of sex determination by SRY (sex-determining region Y) and AMEL (Amelogenin) gene detection was assessed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of DNA extracted from free fetal cells in maternal blood, which is noninvasive for fetus and easier to collect. The PCR amplification of SRY primers produced a single band of 171bp from ewes bearing a male fetus, whereas no band was amplified from the DNA extracted from ewes pregnant to a female fetus. Moreover, two bands of 182 and 242bp in male and a single band of 242 in female fetuses were produced by AMEL gene primers in the PCR reaction. Using this technique 100% of samples were successfully sexed, excluding twins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that sex determination using DNA of free fetal cells in maternal plasma is efficient using both SRY and AMEL gene sequences. It also is evident that this method is not suitable for sex determination of twin pregnancies.((PMID:26617765))This study was initiated to investigate the efficacy of myocardial fibrosis intervention via signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling using bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in which being over-expressed with the aid of bispecific antibody (BiAb) and ultrasound-mediated microbubbles (MB). BiAb was prepared and combined with isolated MSC with CD47 overexpression from male mice and trans-fused into female mice with isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis via the tail vein, followed by MB. This study included five groups. Five weeks after treatment, expression levels of the sex-determining region of Y-chromosome (SRY), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in myocardium were detected by fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT 3 was detected by Western blot.The highest homing number of MSC was in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB group, second highest in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb group, and lowest in MSC alone. Compared with the Control group, CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB, CD47 + MSC + BiAb, CD47 + MSC and MSC groups had decreased levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, STAT 1 and collagen deposition, and increased levels of STAT 3. Up regulated STAT 3 and down regulated TIMP-1 were significantly different in CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB compared with CD47 + MSC or CD47 + MSC + BiAb.CD47 can enhance the homing rate and repairing efficacy of MSC. MSC can improve MMP-TIMP expression in injured myocardium and interfere with myocardial fibrosis after homing, a mechanism that may be related to the STAT-mediated signaling pathway.((PMID:26585458))This paper introduces a two-step cascade enrichment method for isolating nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in maternal blood. The two-step enrichment platform consists of a positive enrichment process based on a red blood cell (RBC) hyperaggregation method and a negative enrichment process using microfluidic technology. An analytical evaluation using blood samples from patients with leukemia showed that the while blood cell (WBC) depletion and NRBC loss rates of the positive enrichment process were 93.98 % and 6.02 %, respectively. Through the two-step cascade enrichment method, 1-396 NRBCs and only 0-6 WBCs were isolated from 1 mL of 18 maternal blood samples. Experimental results also showed that the WBC depletion rate of the proposed two-step method was more than 625,000-fold, and the purity of enriched NRBCs ranged from 20 % to 100 %. Furthermore, SRY (the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) genes were detected in enriched NRBCs, thereby demonstrating that enriched NRBCs contain fetus-derived NRBCs.((PMID:26582524))Gonadoblastoma (GB), a rare in situ germ cell tumor derived from sex cord and germ cells, is closely associated with gonadal dysgenesis. About 80% of GB individuals exhibit 46, XY female phenotype while the others are 45, XY and 46, XX with disorders of sex development. Moreover, 35% of GB can eventually develop into malignant tumors, such as seminoma and dysgerminoma tumors. The molecular genetic mechanism of GB remains to be fully uncovered due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Increasing studies show that the formation of GB is closely related to genes regulating sexual differentiation and determination (e.g., SRY, WT1, SOX9, Foxl2, TSPY, etc), and is affected by the interaction of genetic and epigenetic regulation. Here we describe the clinical and pathological features, diagnosis and treatment of GB, and also summarize the molecular genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the gonadal abnormalities that lead to GB. We analyze and construct the common gene regulatory networks related to the development of GB, and describe some obstacles and deficiencies in current studies to provide innovative perspectives on further studying the pathological and molecular mechanisms of GB.((PMID:26444262))Sex determination in mammals requires expression of the Y-linked gene Sry in the bipotential genital ridges of the XY embryo. Even minor delay of the onset of Sry expression can result in XY sex reversal, highlighting the need for accurate gene regulation during sex determination. However, the location of critical regulatory elements remains unknown. Here, we analysed Sry flanking sequences across many species, using newly available genome sequences and computational tools, to better understand Sry's genomic context and to identify conserved regions predictive of functional roles.Flanking sequences from 17 species were analysed using both global and local sequence alignment methods. Multiple motif searches were employed to characterise common motifs in otherwise unconserved sequence.We identified position-specific conservation of binding motifs for multiple transcription factor families, including GATA binding factors and Oct/Sox dimers. In contrast with the landscape of extremely low sequence conservation around the Sry coding region, our analysis highlighted a strongly conserved interval of ~106 bp within the Sry promoter (which we term the Sry Proximal Conserved Interval, SPCI). We further report that inverted repeats flanking murine Sry are much larger than previously recognised.The unusually fast pace of sequence drift on the Y chromosome sharpens the likely functional significance of both the SPCI and the identified binding motifs, providing a basis for future studies of the role(s) of these elements in Sry regulation.((PMID:26418730))A single-born, 15-month-old Holstein cattle, diagnosed as hermaphrodite, was investigated for estrous cycle, hormonal profiles, karyotype, presence of SRY, as well as anatomopathological and histological aspects. Normal continuous estrous cycles and basal testosterone levels were reported. Necropsy showed the presence of a female genital tract that mismatched a vulvar opening and a male pelvic urethra continued within a penis. Moreover, we observed islands of seminiferous tubules with the presence of germline cells, 2 pampiniform plexi, the corpus cavernosum, the penile urethra, the corpus spongiosum and the glans. Cytogenetic analyses of the blood cells showed an XX karyotype, while the molecular analyses revealed the presence of the SRY gene in several tissues, including blood. This is the first report in the scientific literature of an SRY-positive hermaphrodite Holstein cattle with continuous ovarian cycles.((PMID:26401661))Gonadal sex in most mammals is determined based on sex differentiation of the supporting cell lineages. In mouse XY gonads, SRY induces SOX9 upregulation and subsequent FGF9 expression by embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), leading to the differentiation of Sertoli cells. XX gonads, lacking SRY action, start on the ovarian program through the actions of WNT4 and FOXL2 from around E11.5-12.0. These 2 ovarian factors, together with retinoic acid (RA) action, promote feminization partially through the repression of the masculinizing activities of SOX9, FGF9 and DMRT1. RA initiates meiosis in female germ cell cysts, in which intercellular bridges between interconnected germ cells rapidly undergo cyst breakdown by E17.5. Ovarian morphogenesis is characterized by continuous recruitment of pre-granulosa progenitor cells from the coelomic epithelia during the embryonic stage, which results in the formation of ovigerous cords and tight packing of non-interconnected oocytes (i.e. oocyte nests) at the perinatal stages. At birth, the oocyte nests break down into single oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells, leading to the assembly of primordial follicles. This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular and cellular events of initial ovarian differentiation, meiotic initiation, germ cell nest breakdown, and primordial follicle formation based on anatomical and morphogenetic aspects.((PMID:26219507))Animal researches and clinical studies have supported the relevance between phthalates exposure and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). These disorders may comprise common origin in fetal life, especially during sex determination and differentiation, where the mechanism remains unclear. The present study evaluated the disturbances in gene regulatory networks of sex determination in fetal mouse by in utero Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure. Temporal expression of key sex determination genes were examined during the critical narrow time window, using whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative-PCR. DEHP exposure resulted in significant reduction in mRNA of Sry during sex determination from gestation day (GD) 11.0 to 11.5 in male fetal mice, and the increasing of Sry expression to threshold level on GD 11.5 was delayed. Meanwhile, Gadd45g and Gata4, the upstream genes of Sry, and downstream gene Sox9 were also significantly downregulated in expression. In fetal females, the expression of Wnt4 and beta-catenin were up-regulated by DEHP exposure. Taken together, the results suggest that the potential mechanism of gonadal development disorder by DEHP may origin from repression of important male sex determination signaling pathway, involving Gadd45g → Gata4 → Sry → Sox9. The results would promote a better understanding of the association between phthalate esters (PAEs) exposure and the reductive disorder.((PMID:26184845))The SOX gene family includes many genes that play a determinant role in several developmental pathways. The SOX9 gene has been identified as a major factor in testis development in mammals after it is activated by the SRY gene. However, duplication of the gene itself in some mammalian species, or of a well-delimited upstream 'RevSex' region in humans, has been shown to result in testis development in the absence of the SRY gene. In the current study, we present an accurate analysis of the genomic organization of the SOX9 locus in dogs by both in silico and FISH approaches. Contrary to what is observed in the current dog genome assembly, we found that the genomic organization is quite similar to that reported in humans and other mammalian species, including the position of the RevSex region in respect to SOX9. The analysis of the conserved sequences within this region in 7 mammalian species facilitated the highlighting of a consensus sequence for SRY binding. This new information could help in the identification of evolutionarily conserved elements relevant for SOX9 gene regulation, and could provide valid targets for mutation analysis in XY DSD patients.((PMID:26121024))Diagnosis of fetal gender early in pregnancy is very useful as it would prevent invasive fetal sampling in almost half the cases at risk of inheriting X-linked disorders or those affecting sexual differentiation. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using circulating cell-free fetal (cff) DNA from maternal circulation has emerged as a useful alternative to existing methods for prenatal diagnosis of gender. NIPD eliminates the risk of miscarriage from invasive prenatal diagnosis and the necessity of possessing specialized obstetric skills for fetal tissue sampling. The aim of this study was to compare two Y chromosome markers-SRY and DYS14-for their utility in the diagnosis of fetal gender.Forty-eight plasma samples from pregnant women between 9 and 25 weeks of gestation were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on cff DNA extracted from maternal plasma to detect fetal Y chromosome with SRY (n=27) and DYS14 (n=48) markers.We observed 100% sensitivity and 85.6% specificity in noninvasive Y chromosome detection with the combined use of DYS14 and SRY markers (n=27) compared with the results obtained on using DYS14 (n=48 sensitivity 94%; specificity 71.4%) and SRY (n=27, sensitivity 84%; specificity 92.8%) markers alone.Our results show that the test performance improved with the employment of two Y-amplification assays.((PMID:26108792))Sex-reversal cases in humans and genetic models in mice have revealed that the fate of the bipotential gonad hinges upon the balance between pro-testis SOX9 and pro-ovary beta-catenin pathways. Our central query was: if SOX9 and beta-catenin define the gonad's identity, then what do the gonads become when both factors are absent? To answer this question, we developed mouse models that lack either Sox9, beta-catenin, or both in the somatic cells of the fetal gonads and examined the morphological outcomes and transcriptome profiles. In the absence of Sox9 and beta-catenin, both XX and XY gonads progressively lean toward the testis fate, indicating that expression of certain pro-testis genes requires the repression of the beta-catenin pathway, rather than a direct activation by SOX9. We also observed that XY double knockout gonads were more masculinized than their XX counterpart. To identify the genes responsible for the initial events of masculinization and to determine how the genetic context (XX vs. XY) affects this process, we compared the transcriptomes of Sox9/beta-catenin mutant gonads and found that early molecular changes underlying the XY-specific masculinization involve the expression of Sry and 21 SRY direct target genes, such as Sox8 and Cyp26b1. These results imply that when both Sox9 and beta-catenin are absent, Sry is capable of activating other pro-testis genes and drive testis differentiation. Our findings not only provide insight into the mechanism of sex determination, but also identify candidate genes that are potentially involved in disorders of sex development.((PMID:26083441))This report describes a disorder of the sexual development in a beagle dog resulting in an intersex condition. A 6 mo old beagle was presented for evaluation of a protruding structure from the vulva consistent with an enlarged clitoris. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of both gonadal and uterine structures. Retrograde cystourethrovaginogram showed the presence of an os clitoris and severe vaginal stenosis. Histological studies revealed the presence of bilateral ovotestes and uterus. The gonad had interstitial cells within seminiferous-like tubules lined only with Sertoli cells and abundant interstitial cells among primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. Hormone assays completed before and after gonadohysterectomy showed an elevation in the levels of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone that returned to baseline 3 mo after surgery. Testosterone levels that were within the male reference ranges before surgery decreased to basal levels postsurgically. 17-β-Estradiol levels showed little variation and values were always within the reference ranges for a male. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal female karyotype (2n = 78, XX) and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the absence of the sex-determining region Y gene. In summary, the dog presented bilateral ovotestes and a 2n = 78, XX chromosomal complement lacking the sex determining region Y gene, consistent with a diagnosis of true hermaphroditism.((PMID:26013162))The acquisition of stemness is a hallmark of aggressive human hepatocellular carcinoma (hHCC). The stem cell marker OCT4 is frequently expressed in HCCs, and its expression correlates with those of putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and CSC properties. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of CSC maintenance by SRY through OCT4. We previously reported that Sry is involved in tumor malignancy in rodent HCCs. However, the oncogenic function of SRY in hHCCs is poorly understood. Ectopic expression of SRY increased multiple stem cell factors, including OCT4 and CD13. The OCT4 promoter contained SRY-binding sites that were directly activated by SRY. In HCC-derived cells, SRY knockdown decreased OCT4 expression and cancer stem-like phenotypes such as self-renewal, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity. Conversely, OCT4 and SRY overexpression promoted cancer stem-like phenotypes. OCT4 knockdown in SRY clones downregulated the self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance. These data suggest that SRY is involved in the maintenance of cancer stem-like characteristics through OCT4. Moreover, CSCs of HCC-derived cells differentiated into Tuj1-positive neuron-like cells by retinoic acid. Noteworthily, SRY was highly expressed in some hHCC patients. Taken together, our findings imply a novel therapeutic strategy against CSCs of hHCCs.((PMID:20301589))Nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular disorders of sex development (46,XX testicular DSD) are characterized by the presence of a 46,XX karyotype; male external genitalia ranging from normal to ambiguous; two testicles; azoospermia; and absence of Müllerian structures. Approximately 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size, but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from azoospermia. Approximately 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present at birth with ambiguous genitalia. Gender role and gender identity are reported as male. If untreated, males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the consequences of testosterone deficiency.Diagnosis of nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD is based on the combination of clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing. Endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure. Cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX karyotype. SRY, the gene that encodes the sex-determining region Y protein, is the principal gene known to be associated with 46,XX testicular DSD. Approximately 80% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD are SRY positive as shown by use of FISH or chromosomal microarray (CMA). Rearrangements in or around SOX9 and SOX3 detected by CMA, or rarely karyotype, have recently been reported in a few cases; at least one more as-yet-unknown gene at another locus is implicated.Treatment of manifestations: Similar to that for other causes of testosterone deficiency. After age 14 years, low-dose testosterone therapy is initiated and gradually increased to reach adult levels. In affected individuals with short stature who are eligible for growth hormone therapy, testosterone therapy is either delayed or given at lower doses initially in order to maximize the growth potential. Reduction mammoplasty may need to be considered if gynecomastia remains an issue following testosterone replacement therapy. Treatment for osteopenia is by standard protocols. Providers are encouraged to anticipate the need for further psychological support. Surveillance: Monitor for testosterone effects during testosterone replacement therapy, including prostate size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in adults; routine monitoring of hematocrit, lipid profile, and liver function tests; bone mineral density determination by bone densitometry (DEXA) annually, if osteopenia has been diagnosed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contraindications to testosterone replacement therapy include prostate cancer (known or suspected) and breast cancer; oral androgens such as methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone should not be given because of liver toxicity.SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is generally not inherited because it results from de novo abnormal interchange between the Y chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in the presence of SRY on the X chromosome and infertility. When SRY is translocated to another chromosome or when fertility is preserved, sex-limited autosomal dominant inheritance is observed. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been documented for familial cases thought to be caused by CNV in or around SOX9. The mode of inheritance of other SRY-negative 46,XX testicular DSD is not known, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been postulated. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at risk for SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is possible.((PMID:25875750))((PMID:26046131))The RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38, also known as RNPC1) plays a pivotal role in regulating a wide range of biological processes, from cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest to cell myogenic differentiation. It was originally recognized as an oncogene, and was frequently found to be amplified in prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon carcinoma, esophageal cancer, dog lymphomas and breast cancer. In the present study, the complete RNPC1 gene was identified in a number of vertebrate genomes, suggesting that RNPC1 exists in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. In the different genomes, the gene had a similar 4 exon/3 intron organization, and all the genetic loci were syntenically conserved. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the RNPC1 gene from the mammalian, bird, reptile and teleost lineage formed a species-specific cluster. A total of 34 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 14 SNPs causing missense mutations, 8 exonic splicing enhancer SNPs and 12 SNPs causing nonsense mutations, were identified in the human RNPC1 gene. RNPC1 was found to be expressed in bladder, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian, skin and soft tissue cancer. In 14 of the 94 tests, an association between RNPC1 gene expression and cancer prognosis was observed. We found that the association between the expression of RNPC1 and prognosis varied in different types of cancer, and even in the same type of cancer from the different databases used. This suggests that the function of RNPC1 in these tumors may be multidimensional. The sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 5 (Sox5), runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), CCAAT displacement protein 1 (CUTL1), v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog (Rel)A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ isoform 2 (PPARγ2) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) regulatory transcription factor binding sites were identified in the upstream (promoter) region of the RNPC1 gene, and may thus be involved in the effects of RNPC1 in tumors.((PMID:22781928))Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) function as mitogens and morphogens during vertebrate development. In the present study, to characterise the regulatory mechanism of FGF8 gene expression in developing Xenopus embryos the upstream region of the Xenopus FGF8 (XFGF8) gene was isolated. The upstream region of the XFGF8 gene contains two putative binding sites for the SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) transcription factor. A reporter assay with serially deleted constructs revealed that the putative SOX2-binding motif may be a critical cis-element for XFGF8 gene activation in developing Xenopus embryos. Furthermore, Xenopus SOX2 (XSOX2) physically interacted with the SOX2-binding motif within the upstream region of the XFGF8 gene in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of endogenous XSOX2 resulted in loss of XFGF8 gene expression in midbrain-hindbrain junction, auditory placode, lens placode and forebrain in developing Xenopus embryos. Collectively, our results suggest that XSOX2 directly upregulates XFGF8 gene expression in the early embryonic development of Xenopus.((PMID:18579725))Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1 (NR5A1 previously known as SF-1/AD4BP) is a transcription factor involved in the development of adrenal/gonadal tissues and steroidogenic lineage cell differentiation in adult somatic stem cells. To understand the cellular signaling network that regulates NR5A1 gene expression, loss of function screening with an siRNA kinome library, and gain of function screening with an addressable full-length cDNA library representing one quarter of the human genome was carried out. The NR5A1 gene expression was activated in mesenchymal stem cells by siRNA directed against protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, erb-B3, RhoGAP (ARHGAP26), and hexokinase 2, none of which were previously known to be involved in the NR5A1 gene expression. Among these, we identified crosstalk between erb-B3 and PKC-delta signaling cascades. In addition, the gain of function studies indicated that sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 15 (SOX15), TEA domain family member 4, KIAA1257 (a gene of unknown function), ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 6, Josephin domain containing 1, centromere protein, TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 5-like RNA polymerase, and inducible T-cell co-stimulator activate NR5A1 gene expression. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of NR5A1 gene expression.((PMID:18156714))It is known that the Y chromosome or Y-specific sequence is present in about 6% of Turner syndrome (TS) patients and that it predisposes them to gonadoblastoma formation with an estimated risk of 15-25%. In this study, we performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 32 patients with TS to detect Y-specific sequence. The results were compared with those obtained by the fluorescence in situ hybridaization (FISH) method.Cytogenetic analysis was performed by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral lymphocyte cultures, using G-banding. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood for PCR. Seven different sets of oligonucleotide primers, sex determining region Y (SRY), zinc finger gene on the Y chromosome (ZFY), testis specific protein Y (TSPY), DYZ3, DYF49S1, RNA binding motif protein (RBM), and DYZ1, spanning on centromeres and short and long arms of the Y chromosome were used for PCR. FISH was carried out using X and Y chromosome enumeration probe for Xp11.1-q11.1 (DXZ1 locus) and Yp11.1-q11.1 (DYZ3 locus), respectively.Among 32 patients with TS, four (12.5%) were positive for Y specific sequence by PCR. Of these, two patients were detected previously by a cytogenetic analysis: 45,X/47,XYY and 45,X/46,XY. Only one Y specific sequence, DYZ3, was detected by PCR in the other two patients without cytogenetically obvious Y chromosome. Y signal was not detected by FISH for the last two patients.It may be reasonable to consider using a PCR method to screen for Y-specific sequences in all patients with TS. Even though we did not demonstrate Y-signal by FISH in patients with PCR positive and cytogenetically no obvious Y chromosome, FISH may be another useful method in TS patient, and futher investigation is nessessary.((PMID:12081133))A cDNA encoding rat homologue of the previously characterized mouse Sox6 was isolated by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning strategy. Comparison of this eDNA with homologous mouse, human and rainbow trout cDNA exhibited an overall amino acid sequence identity of 99.6, 89.3 and 76.3% respectively. The leucine-zipper and HMG-box motif were almost completely conserved between these homologues. The expression of Sox6 was determined in rat by Northern hybridization and Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. rSox6 (rat Sox6) was specifically expressed in the neonatal brain and adult testis with Northern blotting. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for the determination of Sox6 mRNA was examined. The rSox6 was expressed in the neonatal brain and adult testis as well as by Northern blotting and also expressed in the adult eyeball and slightly in the ovary.((PMID:10871192))The SOX (sex-determining region [SRY]-type high mobility group [HMG] box) family of transcription factors play key roles in determining cell fate during organ development. In this study, we have identified a new human SOX gene, SOX13, as encoding the type 1 diabetes autoantigen, islet cell antigen 12 (ICA12). Sequence analysis showed that SOX13 belongs to the class D subgroup of SOX transcription factors, which contain a leucine zipper motif and a region rich in glutamine. SOX13 autoantibodies occurred at a significantly higher frequency among 188 people with type 1 diabetes (18%) than among 88 with type 2 diabetes (6%) or 175 healthy control subjects (4%). Deletion mapping of the antibody epitopes showed that the autoantibodies were primarily directed against an epitope requiring the majority of the protein. SOX13 RNA was detected in most human tissues, with the highest levels in the pancreas, placenta, and kidney. Immunohistochemistry on sections of human pancreas identified SOX13 in the islets of Langerhans, where staining was mostly cytoplasmic. In mouse pancreas, Sox13 was present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of beta-cells as well as other islet cell types. Recombinant SOX13 protein bound to the SOX consensus DNA motif AACAAT, and binding was inhibited by homodimer formation. These observations-along with the known molecular interactions of the closely related protein, rainbow trout Sox23-suggest that SOX13 may be activated for nuclear import and DNA binding through heterodimer formation. In conclusion, we have identified ICA12 as the putative transcription factor SOX13 and demonstrated an increased frequency of autoantibody reactivity in sera from type 1 diabetic subjects compared with type 2 diabetic and healthy control subjects.((PMID:10852465))Leydig cells and Sertoli cells of the testes produce hormones that cause male differentiation, if receptors are present. The Y chromosomal SRY gene (sex determining Region Y gene) acts as TDF and is required for regular male sex determination. SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the HMG-box motif(high-mobility group-box), which acts as DNA binding region. Here, we describe a nonmosaic XY sex-reversed female with pure gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY karyotype, completely female external genitalia, normal Müllerian ducts, absence of Wolffian ducts, streak gonads) who harbored a yolk-sac tumor and was referred for the assessment of primary amenorrhea. Using genomic PCR analysis, a 423-bp PCR product, encompassing the HMG-box of the SRY gene, was amplified from the proposita, her father, and her three brothers, whereas no band was visible in the patient's mother and her three sisters. The PCR products were sequenced for mutations subsequently. A new de novo missense mutation within the HMG-box of the SRY gene was discovered in the proposita. A G is replaced by an A in codon 95 at position +284, resulting in the replacement of the nonpolar aminoacid glycine by the polar amino acid glutamate. The glycine at codon 95 is highly conserved between the family of HMG-box proteins and between species. This point mutation has not been described earlier and brings the total number of SRY mutations described so far to 36, each mutation being unique. This mutation was not detected in the patient's father and her male siblings. The present data provide further evidence to support the functional importance of the putative DNA binding activity of the SRY HMG-box domain.((PMID:9687017))In vertebrates several proteins containing a covalently bound selenocysteine residue have been identified. Among these, selenoprotein P is the most unusual one: depending on the species, 8-12 selenocysteine residues are cotranslationally integrated into the polypeptide chain. The protein was traced in rat plasma, but its role has not been worked out so far. In order to improve our understanding on selenoprotein P we investigated its tissue-specific expression and its genomic DNA. RNA in situ hybridization analyses confirmed the liver-specific expression in mice. Selenoprotein P was also found to be expressed in testis, brain, gut, and hematopoietic cells. The murine selp gene contains five exons within 10.3 kb with a coding sequence restricted to exons 2 to 5. The complete gene including the selp promoter was sequenced. One TATA motif 38 bp upstream to exon 1 suggests transcription of selp by RNA polymerase II. Within the 1116 bp upstream of exon 1 four hepatic nuclear factor 3beta (HNF3beta) binding motifs were found, which is in line with liver-specific expression of selenoprotein P. The expression in hematopoietic cells might be due to multiple GATA-1 motifs. Two BRN-2 motifs suitable for the binding of brain-specific regulatory factors correlated to the selenoprotein P expression in the cerebellum. Selenoprotein P was also expressed in Leydig cells which could be regulated by binding proteins docking to the SRY motifs present in the promoter region.((PMID:9650760))The presence of Y chromosome sequences in Turner syndrome (TS) patients may predispose them to gonadoblastoma formation with an estimated risk of 15-25%. The aim of this study was to determine the presence and the incidence of cryptic Y chromosome material in the genome of TS patients. The methodology involved a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR followed by Southern blot analysis of three genes the sex determining region Y (SRY), testis specific protein Y encoded (TSPY) and RNA binding motif protein (RBM) (previously designated as YRRM) and nine additional STSs spanning all seven intervals of the Y chromosome. The methodology has a high sensitivity as it detects one 46,XY cell among 10(5) 46,XX cells. Reliability was ensured by taking several precautions to avoid false positive results. We report the results of screening 50 TS patients and the identification of cryptic Y chromosome material in 12 (24%) of them. Karyotypes were divided in four groups: 5 (23.8%) patients out of the 21 TS patients which have the 45,X karyotype (group A) also have cryptic Y sequences; none (0%) of the 7 patients who have karyotypes with anomalies on one of the X chromosomes have Y mosaicism (group B); 1 (6.3%) of the 16 patients with a mosaic karyotype have Y material (group C); and 6 (100%) out of 6 patients with a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) have Y chromosome sequences (group D). Nine of the 12 patients positive for cryptic Y material were recalled for a repeat study. Following new DNA extraction, molecular analysis was repeated and, in conjunction with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the Y centromeric specific probe Yc-2, confirmed the initial positive DNA findings. This study used a reliable and sensitive methodology to identify the presence of Y chromosome material in TS patients thus providing not only a better estimate of a patient's risk in developing either gonadoblastoma or another form of gonadal tumor but also the overall incidence of cryptic Y mosaicism.((PMID:19324078))Evidence from developmental and regeneration studies of the cochlea and other tissues gives reason to hypothesize a role for nonneural cells in the growth and regeneration of cochlear spiral ganglion nerve fibers. We examined the spontaneous associations of regrowing neurites and nonneural cells in mixed cultures of dissociated newborn mouse spiral ganglia. After 7 days in vitro, nonneural cells formed a confluent layer in the culture well. Regrowing neurites grew atop this layer, forming non-uniform patterns that were similar to those formed by endogenously expressed laminin-1, entactin and integrin beta4, but not fibronectin or tenascin. In cultures grown for 42 h and maintained in three different growth media, all regrowing neurites were preferentially associated with spindle-shaped nonneural cells. The spindle-shaped cells incorporated bromodeoxyuridine in culture and were immunoreactive for the proteins S100, laminin-1, laminin-2, SRY-related high-mobility-group box 10 transcription factor (Sox10), neurotrophin receptor (P75) and connexin29 but negative for fibronectin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These cells existed in the culture within a much larger, general population of fibronectin positive cells. Immunolabeling of fixed cochleas from neonatal mice localized Sox10, P75 and connexin29, to peripheral nerve bundles. The observed expressions of protein markers and the bipolar, spindle shape of the neurite-associated cells indicate that they are derived in vitro from the original Schwann or satellite cells in the ganglion or spiral lamina. The spontaneous and preferential association of neurites in culture with mitotic Schwann cells highlights the potential contribution neurite-Schwann cell interactions may have in promoting the growth and regrowth of damaged spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea.((PMID:27397756))To explore that it is necessary to routinely detect chromosomes in infertile patients, we investigated peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype in 16,294 male infertile patients in the north-east of China and analysed the incidence and type of chromosomal anomaly and polymorphism. G-banding karyotype analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed in 16,294 cases. Semen analysis was performed three times in all the men. PCR and FISH confirmed the presence of the SRY gene. The rate of chromosomal anomaly in the 16,294 male infertile patients was 4.15% (677/16,294). The rates of chromosomal anomaly were 0.24% in normal semen group, 12.6% in light oligoasthenospermia group, 4.7% in moderate-to-severe oligoasthenospermia group and 9.59% in azoospermia group. There are two male infertile patients with 45,X chromosome karyotype. One X male patient had confirmed the presence of the SRY gene and FISH analysis demonstrated its location on the p arm of chromosome 13. The other X male patient had not found SRY gene in its whole-genome DNA. Meanwhile, sperm motility is slightly oligo-asthenozoospermic at the age of 35-39 and nearly azoospermic at the age of 40-45. As the rates of chromosomal anomaly are 0.24% and 12.6% even in normal semen group and light oligoasthenospermia group, the rates of chromosomal polymorphism are 5.36% and 25.51% in normal semen group and light oligoasthenospermia group, respectively; it is necessary to explore peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype in all infertile couples. We mentioned that Y, 1, 2, 9 and 12 chromosomes were quite important about male infertility. These findings demonstrate that autosomal retention of SRY can be submicroscopic and emphasise the importance of PCR and FISH in the genetic workup of the monosomic X male. At the same time, it suggested that male infertility might be related to meiotic disturbances with spermatogenetic arrest in Y-autosome translocations, which could result in infertility by reduction of sperm production. Last but not least, ageing is one of the factors that could reduce sperm motility and quality.((PMID:27089505))Testicular or ovotesticular disorder of sex development (DSD) in genetic females (78,XX; SRY-negative) has been reported quite frequently in numerous dog breeds and is usually diagnosed due to the presence of female external genitalia with an enlarged clitoris. The molecular background of this disorder, diagnosed also in human and other mammals, is not fully understood. However, it has recently been proposed that a copy number variation (CNV) in the region upstream of the SOX9 gene is associated with it. We described a rare case of this disorder in a French Bulldog with abdominal testes and male external genitalia (a slightly malformed penis). FISH studies showed a female karyotype, lack of a translocation involving the Y chromosome, and a distinct size variation in the CNV region (CNVR) upstream of the SOX9 gene, located on chromosome 9 (CFA9). A large FISH variant on a single CFA9 and a lack of the variant on its homologue was observed. Surprisingly, in the mother of this DSD dog, 2 normal-sized variants were identified which means that the CNV in the DSD dog was de novo. Our observations are in agreement with earlier suggestions that a high number of copies at the CNVR upstream of SOX9 may be associated with this type of DSD.((PMID:26989023))Somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes have recently been identified in a large proportion of glial tumors of the CNS and reported to be a strong prognostic factor in gliomas whatever the tumor grade. Few data are available in the literature regarding the relationship between IDH mutations and HIF expression in low-grade gliomas (LGGs), especially in a recently described aggressive molecular subtype: "triple negative" (IDH non mutated, 1p 19q non codeleted, p53 expression negative) gliomas. We analyzed clinical, radiological and molecular features of a series of 31 grade II/III gliomas. p53 expression, 1p19q deletion and IDH mutation status were provided for all tumors. Also HIF (hypoxia inducible factor)-1α, HIF-2α, HAF, Sox2 (SRY(Sex determining region Y)-box2) and OCT (octamer binding factor) 3/4 expressions were analyzed. We found positive HIF-2α staining in 38.7% of cases which was uncorrelated to HIF-1α expression or IDH1/2 mutation status. However, HIF-2α staining was significantly associated with HAF expression, a stem-like cell marker, in the whole population. HAF expression was present in 74.2% of cases and significantly correlated to Sox2 expression. Furthermore, HAF expression was significantly associated with the "triple negative" glioma phenotype. We provide here first evidence that HAF, a stem-like cell marker, expression is highly correlated to the triple negative aggressive LGG/AG molecular phenotype suggesting that these tumours might arise from cells of different origin.((PMID:26985348))Chromosomal defects are relatively frequent in infertile men however, translocations between the Y chromosome and autosomes are rare and less than 40 cases of Y-autosome translocation have been reported. In particular, only three individuals has been described with a Y;21 translocation, up to now. We report on an additional case of an infertile man in whom a Y;21 translocation was associated with the deletion of a large part of the Y chromosome long arm. Applying various techniques, including conventional cytogenetic procedures, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) studies, we identified a derivative chromosome originating from a fragment of the short arm of the chromosome Y translocated on the short arm of the 21 chromosome. The Y chromosome structural rearrangement resulted in the intactness of the entire short arm, including the sex-determining region Y (SRY) and the short stature homeobox (SHOX) loci, although translocated on the 21 chromosome, and the loss of a large part of the long arm of the Y chromosome, including azoospermia factor-a (AZFa), AZFb, AZFc and Yq heterochromatin regions. This is the first case in which a (Yp;21p) translocation has been ascertained using an array-CGH approach, thus reporting details of such a rearrangement at higher resolution.((PMID:26966900))Research into prenatal programming in the pig has shown that the sex of the developing embryo or fetus can influence the developmental outcome. Therefore, the ability to determine an embryo's sex is necessary in many experiments particularly regarding early development. The present protocol demonstrates an inexpensive, rapid and non-toxic preparation of pig genomic DNA for use with PCR. Day 30 embryos must be humanely collected according to the guidelines established by Institutional Animal Policy and Welfare Committees for the present protocol. The preparation of the whole embryo for this PCR based sexing technique simply involves grinding the frozen embryo to a fine powder using a pre-chilled mortar and pestle. PCR-quality DNA is released from a small amount of embryo powder by applying a hot incubation in an alkaline lysis reagent. Next, the DNA solution is mixed with neutralization buffer and used directly for PCR. Two primer pairs are generated to detect specific sex determining region of the Y- chromosome (SRY) and ZFX region of the X- chromosome with high accuracy and specificity. The same protocol can be applied to other elongated embryos (Day 10 to Day 14) earlier than Day 30. Also, this protocol can be carried with 96-welled plates when screening a large number of embryos, making it feasible for automation and high-throughput sex typing.((PMID:26953815))Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), 1 of the most common salivary gland malignancies, arises from the intercalated ducts, which are composed of inner ductal epithelial cells and outer myoepithelial cells. The objective of this study was to determine the genomic subtypes of ACC with emphasis on dominant cell type to identify potential specific biomarkers for each subtype and to improve the understanding of this disease.A whole-genome expression study was performed based on 42 primary salivary ACCs and 5 normal salivary glands. RNA from these specimens was subjected to expression profiling with RNA sequencing, and results were analyzed to identify transcripts in epithelial-dominant ACC (E-ACC), myoepithelial-dominant ACC (M-ACC), and all ACC that were expressed differentially compared with the transcripts in normal salivary tissue.In total, the authors identified 430 differentially expressed transcripts that were unique to E-ACC, 392 that were unique to M-ACC, and 424 that were common to both M-ACC and E-ACC. The sets of E-ACC-specific and M-ACC-specific transcripts were sufficiently large to define and differentiate E-ACC from M-ACC. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified known cancer-related genes for 60% of the E-ACC transcripts, 69% of the M-ACC transcripts, and 68% of the transcripts that were common in both E-ACC and M-ACC. Three sets of highly expressed candidate genes-distal-less homeobox 6 (DLX6) for E-ACC; protein keratin 16 (KRT16), SRY box 11 (SOX11), and v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) for M-ACC; and engrailed 1 (EN1) and statherin (STATH), which are common to both E-ACC and M-ACC)-were further validated at the protein level.The current results enabled the authors to identify novel potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers in E-ACC and M-ACC individually, with the implication that EN1, DLX6, and OTX1 (orthodenticle homeobox 1) are potential drivers of these cancers.

With a lack of genomic crossover, MSY is one of the few genomic areas under similar variation and evolutionary selection in inbred and outbred animal populations, allowing for an assessment of evolutionary mechanisms to translate between the populations.Using next-generation sequencing, MSY consomic strains, molecular characterization, and large-scale phenotyping, we present here regions of MSY that contribute to inbred strain phenotypes.We have shown that (1) MSY of rat has nine autosomal gene transposition events with strain-specific selection; (2) sequence variants in MSY occur with a 1.98-fold higher number of variants than other chromosomes in seven sequenced rat strains; (3) Sry, the most studied MSY gene, has undergone extensive gene duplications, driving ubiquitous expression not seen in human or mouse; (4) the expression profile of Sry in the rat is driven by the insertion of the Sry2 copy into an intron of the ubiquitously expressed Kdm5d gene in antisense orientation, but due to several loss of function mutations in the Sry2 protein, nuclear localization and transcriptional control are decreased; (5) expression of Sry copies other than Sry2 in the rat overlaps with the expression profile for human SRY; (6) gene duplications and sequence variants (P76T) of Sry can be selected for phenotypes such as high blood pressure and androgen receptor signaling within inbred mating; and most importantly, (7) per chromosome size, MSY contributes to higher strain-specific phenotypic variation relative to all other chromosomes, with 53 phenotypes showing both a male to female and consomic cross significance.The data presented supports a high probability of MSY genetic variation altering a broad range of inbred rat phenotypes.((PMID:26677084))The swamp type of the Asian water buffalo is assumed to have been domesticated by about 4000 years BP, following the introduction of rice cultivation. Previous localizations of the domestication site were based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation within China, accounting only for the maternal lineage. We carried out a comprehensive sampling of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Nepal and Bangladesh and sequenced the mtDNA Cytochrome b gene and control region and the Y-chromosomal ZFY, SRY and DBY sequences. Swamp buffalo has a higher diversity of both maternal and paternal lineages than river buffalo, with also a remarkable contrast between a weak phylogeographic structure of river buffalo and a strong geographic differentiation of swamp buffalo. The highest diversity of the swamp buffalo maternal lineages was found in south China and north Indochina on both banks of the Mekong River, while the highest diversity in paternal lineages was in the China/Indochina border region. We propose that domestication in this region was later followed by introgressive capture of wild cows west of the Mekong. Migration to the north followed the Yangtze valley as well as a more eastern route, but also involved translocations of both cows and bulls over large distances with a minor influence of river buffaloes in recent decades. Bayesian analyses of various migration models also supported domestication in the China/Indochina border region. Coalescence analysis yielded consistent estimates for the expansion of the major swamp buffalo haplogroups with a credibility interval of 900 to 3900 years BP. The spatial differentiation of mtDNA and Y-chromosomal haplotype distributions indicates a lack of gene flow between established populations that is unprecedented in livestock.((PMID:25987976))Sex differences in pituitary growth hormone (GH) are well documented and coordinate maturation and growth. GH and its receptor are also produced in the brain where they may impact cognitive function and synaptic plasticity, and estradiol produces Gh sex differences in rat hippocampus. In mice, circulating estradiol increases Gh mRNA in female but not in male medial preoptic area (mPOA); therefore, additional factors regulate sexually dimorphic Gh expression in the brain. Thus, we hypothesized that sex chromosomes interact with estradiol to promote sex differences in GH. Here, we assessed the contributions of both estradiol and sex chromosome complement on Gh mRNA levels in three large brain regions: the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum.We used the four core genotypes (FCG) mice, which uncouple effects of sex chromosomes and gonadal sex. The FCG model has a deletion of the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (Sry) and transgenic insertion of Sry on an autosome. Adult FCG mice were gonadectomized and given either a blank Silastic implant or an implant containing 17β-estradiol. Significant differences in GH protein and mRNA were attributed to estradiol replacement, gonadal sex, sex chromosome complement, and their interactions, which were assessed by ANOVA and planned comparisons.Estradiol increased Gh mRNA in the cerebellum and hippocampus, regardless of sex chromosome complement or gonadal sex. In contrast, in the hypothalamus, females had higher Gh mRNA than males, and XY females had more Gh mRNA than XY males and XX females. This same pattern was observed for GH protein. Because the differences in Gh mRNA in the hypothalamus did not replicate prior studies using other mouse models and tissue from mPOA or arcuate nucleus, we examined GH protein in the arcuate, a subdivision of the hypothalamus. Like the previous reports, and in contrast to the entire hypothalamus, a sex chromosome complement effect showed that XX mice had more GH than XY in the arcuate.Sex chromosome complement regulates GH in some but not all brain areas, and within the hypothalamus, sex chromosomes have cell-specific actions on GH. Thus, sex chromosome complement and estradiol both contribute to GH sex differences in the brain.((PMID:25965411))Minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) vaccines have the potential to augment graft-versus-tumor effects without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We used mixed hematopoietic chimerism in the canine model of major histocompatibility complex-matched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation as a platform to develop a miHA vaccination regimen.We engineered DNA plasmids and replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 constructs encoding large sections of canine SMCY and the entire canine SRY gene.Priming with replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 constructs and boosting with ex vivo plasmid-transfected dendritic cells and cutaneous delivery of plasmids with a particle-mediated epidermal delivery device (PMED) in 2 female dogs induced antigen-specific T-cell responses. Similar responses were observed after a prime-boost vaccine regimen in three female hematopoietic cell transplantation donors. Subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion resulted in a significant change of chimerism in 1 of 3 male recipients without any signs of graft-versus-host disease. The change in chimerism in the recipient occurred in association with the development of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the same peptide pools detected in the donor.These studies describe the first in vivo response to miHA vaccination in a large, outbred animal model without using recipient cells to sensitize the donor. This model provides a platform for ongoing experiments designed to define optimal miHA targets and develop protocols to directly vaccinate the recipient.((PMID:25762186))MRI for in vivo stem cell tracking remains controversial. Here we tested the hypothesis that MRI can track the long-term fate of the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles labelled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) following intramyocardially injection in AMI rats. MSCs (1 × 10(6)) from male rats doubly labeled with SPIO and DAPI were injected 2 weeks after myocardial infarction. The control group received cell-free media injection. In vivo serial MRI was performed at 24 hours before cell delivery (baseline), 3 days, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after cell delivery, respectively. Serial follow-up MRI demonstrated large persistent intramyocardial signal-voids representing SPIO during the follow-up of 4 weeks, and MSCs did not moderate the left ventricular dysfunction. The TUNEL analysis confirmed that MSCs engrafted underwent apoptosis. The histopathological studies revealed that the site of cell injection was infiltrated by inflammatory cells progressively and the iron-positive cells were macrophages identified by CD68 staining, but very few or no DAPI-positive stem cells at 4 weeks after cells transplantation. The presence of engrafted cells was confirmed by real-time PCR, which showed that the amount of Y-chromosome-specific SRY gene was consistent with the results. MRI may not reliably track the long-term fate of SPIO-labeled MSCs engraftment in heart.((PMID:25546075))Processes of development during fetal life profoundly transform tendons from a plastic tissue into a highly differentiated structure, characterised by a very low ability to regenerate after injury in adulthood. Sheep tendon is frequently used as a translational model to investigate cell-based regenerative approaches. However, in contrast to other species, analytical and comparative baseline studies on the normal developmental maturation of sheep tendons from fetal through to adult life are not currently available. Thus, a detailed morphological and biochemical study was designed to characterise tissue maturation during mid- (2 months of pregnancy: 14 cm of length) and late fetal (4 months: 40 cm of length) life, through to adulthood. The results confirm that ovine tendon morphology undergoes profound transformations during this period. Endotenon was more developed in fetal tendons than in adult tissues, and its cell phenotype changed through tendon maturation. Indeed, groups of large rounded cells laying on smaller and more compacted ones expressing osteocalcin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were identified exclusively in fetal mid-stage tissues, and not in late fetal or adult tendons. VEGF, NGF as well as blood vessels and nerve fibers showed decreased expression during tendon development. Moreover, the endotenon of mid- and late fetuses contained identifiable cells that expressed several pluripotent stem cell markers [Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), SRY Determining Region Y Box-2 (SOX2), Nanog Homeobox (NANOG) and Octamer Binding Transcription Factor-4A (OCT-4A)]. These cells were not identifiable in adult specimens. Ovine tendon development was also accompanied by morphological modifications to cell nuclei, and a progressive decrease in cellularity, proliferation index and expression of connexins 43 and 32. Tendon maturation was similarly characterised by modulation of several other gene expression profiles, including Collagen type I, Collagen type III, Scleraxis B, Tenomodulin, Trombospondin 4 and Osteocalcin. These gene profiles underwent a dramatic reduction in adult tissues. Transforming growth factor-β~1 expression (involved in collagen synthesis) underwent a similar decrease. In conclusion, these morphological studies carried out on sheep tendons at different stages of development and aging offer normal structural and molecular baseline data to allow accurate evaluation of data from subsequent interventional studies investigating tendon healing and regeneration in ovine experimental models.((PMID:25497574))One in 4500 children is born with ambiguous genitalia, milder phenotypes occur in one in 300 newborns. Conventional time-consuming hormonal and genetic work-up provides a genetic diagnosis in around 20-40% of 46,XY cases with ambiguous genitalia. All others remain without a definitive diagnosis. The investigation of milder cases, as suggested by recent reports remains controversial.Integrated clinical, hormonal and genetic screening was performed in a sequential series of 46, XY children, sex-assigned male, who were referred to our pediatric endocrine service for atypical genitalia (2007-2013).A consecutive cohort of undervirilized 46,XY children with external masculinization score (EMS) 2-12, was extensively investigated. In four patients, a clinical diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome or Mowat-Wilson syndrome was made and genetically supported in 2/3 and 1/1 cases respectively. Hormonal data were suggestive of a (dihydro)testosterone biosynthesis disorder in four cases, however no HSD17B3 or SRD5A2 mutations were found. Array-CGH revealed a causal structural variation in 2/6 syndromic patients. In addition, three novel NR5A1 mutations were found in non-syndromic patients. Interestingly, one mutation was present in a fertile male, underlining the inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability of NR5A1-associated phenotypes. No AR, SRY or WT1 mutations were identified.Overall, a genetic diagnosis could be established in 19% of non-syndromic and 33% of syndromic cases. There is no difference in diagnostic yield between patients with more or less pronounced phenotypes, as expressed by the external masculinisation score (EMS). The clinical utility of array-CGH is high in syndromic cases. Finally, a sequential gene-by-gene approach is time-consuming, expensive and inefficient. Given the low yield and high expense of Sanger sequencing, we anticipate that massively parallel sequencing of gene panels and whole exome sequencing hold promise for genetic diagnosis of 46,XY DSD boys with an undervirilized phenotype.((PMID:25308063))Horses are characterized as having a greater rate of chromosomal abnormalities than other species, which are mainly related to the sex chromosome pair and produce a series of different anomalies known as disorders in sexual development (DSD). In the present study, three Pura Raza Española (PRE) and one Menorquín (MEN) horses were studied and an incompatibility in their genetic and phenotypic sex were detected. Animals were karyotyped by conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses and characterized using genomic techniques. Although all individuals, were totally unrelated, these animals had the same abnormality (64,XY SRY negative DSD) despite having an anatomically normal external mare phenotype. Therefore, this syndrome could remain undiagnosed in a large percentage of cases because the physiological and morphological symptoms are rare. In the present study, a slight gonadal dysgenesis was observed only in older individuals. Interestingly this chromosomal abnormality has been previously reported less than twenty times, and never in the PRE or MEN horses. With the present research, it is demonstrated that the use of genetic and cytogenetic diagnostic tools in veterinary practice could be an important complementary test to determine the origin of unexplained reproductive failures among horses.((PMID:25247640))The commitment of the embryonic gonad towards the male or female fate is a sequential and complex developmental process. The sex-independent growth and development of the adrenogonadal primordium into the bipotential gonadal ridge is committed to the formation of testis in the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. SRY upregulates the expression of SOX9 that sets into motion a cascade of complex genetic interactions for the formation of male internal and external genitalia whilst repressing the formation of female genitalia. The initiation and maintenance of somatic sex of the gonad as either male or female is achieved by suppression of the alternate fate. However, at least in mice, the primary sex-determining decision is not final but is maintained in adulthood by a mutually antagonistic double-repressive pathway. In the human, any imbalance between these two antagonistic genetic and physiological pathways results in inappropriate gonad differentiation and function leading to disorders of sex development (DSD). Genetic analysis of individuals presenting with DSD and sex-reversed mice has revealed a number of sexually dimorphic genes that are involved in the formation of mammalian gonads, which are discussed in this chapter. Despite an increase in the knowledge of genes involved in mammalian sex determination, the molecular mechanisms remain by and large undetermined. The use of novel 'omics' technologies for analyzing a large number of patients with DSD, and careful assessment of the resulting datasets may result in the identification of novel genetic factors in human sex determination and lead to the development of novel ex vivo cellular models.((PMID:25236417))The extant Cabrera's vole, Microtus cabrerae, differs in morphology and evolutionary history from the other species of Microtus. This arvicoline has unique derived features in the cranium, mandible and dentition. Probably its most conspicuous features are its large size, the high skull in lateral view, the long and distally broad nasals, and the triangle shape of the anteroconid complex, with a marked labio-lingual asymmetry of the occlusal surface of the first lower molars. In this study, we propose a phylogenetic lineage that includes Cabrera's vole in what until now has been the Microtus subgenus Iberomys. Paleontological information and several life history traits support the elevation of Iberomys to the rank of genus. Genus Iberomys comprises species that have appeared in succession during the Quaternary: in the Early Pleistocene, the extinct I. huescarensis in the Middle Pleistocene, the extinct I. mediterraneus and in the Late Pleistocene, the extant I. cabrerae. Interestingly, the extant species shows several biological singularities, such as multiple polymorphic copies of the SRY male-specific gene in both males and females, and the lowest basal metabolic rate in relation to weight among arvicoline species. Likewise, its habitat requirement is unique among the Iberian arvicolines. Accordingly, the biological and paleontological data that we present in this work support the elevation of its taxonomic rank to that of genus. This study also suggests a modification of nomenclature: Microtus (Iberomys) brecciensis is replaced with I. mediterraneus and the common name of the extant M. (I.) cabrerae changed from 'topillo' to 'iberon' to improve conservation and protection actions.((PMID:25227289))We report on a patient with a 47,XXY karyotype who presents a normal female phenotype, which is an extremely rare observation worldwide. The patient is infertile. Type B ultrasound scans and other tests suggested that her ovaries had completely failed. Microsatellite DNA marker analysis revealed that the 2 X chromosomes were derived from her mother and that this abnormality was caused by non-disjunction of the maternal X chromosomes during meiosis II. Copy number variation analysis identified 2 large de novo deletions in her Y chromosome. Remarkably, one of the deleted regions includes the SRY gene locus, which might explain her female phenotype. However, the genetic mechanism of her ovarian failure remains unclear. This paper is the first report of a 47,XXY female with ovarian failure.((PMID:24972717))Relatively little is known about cellular subpopulations in the mature nucleus pulposus (NP). Detailed understanding of the ontogenetic, cellular and molecular characteristics of functional intervertebral disc (IVD) cell populations is pivotal to the successful development of cell replacement therapies and IVD regeneration. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether phenotypically distinct clonal cell lines representing different subpopulations in the human NP could be generated using immortalization strategies.Nondegenerate healthy disc material (age range, 8 to 15 years) was obtained as surplus surgical material. Early passage NP monolayer cell cultures were initially characterized using a recently established NP marker set. NP cells were immortalized by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LTag) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression. Immortalized cells were clonally expanded and characterized based on collagen type I, collagen type II, α1 (COL2A1), and SRY-box 9 (SOX9) protein expression profiles, as well as on expression of a subset of established in vivo NP cell lineage markers.A total of 54 immortal clones were generated. Profiling of a set of novel NP markers (CD24, CA12, PAX1, PTN, FOXF1 and KRT19 mRNA) in a representative set of subclones substantiated successful immortalization of multiple cellular subpopulations from primary isolates and confirmed their NP origin and/or phenotype. We were able to identify two predominant clonal NP subtypes based on their morphological characteristics and their ability to induce SOX9 and COL2A1 under conventional differentiation conditions. In addition, cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24)-negative NP responder clones formed spheroid structures in various culture systems, suggesting the preservation of a more immature phenotype compared to CD24-positive nonresponder clones.Here we report the generation of clonal NP cell lines from nondegenerate human IVD tissue and present a detailed characterization of NP cellular subpopulations. Differential cell surface marker expression and divergent responses to differentiation conditions suggest that the NP subtypes may correspond to distinct maturation stages and represent distinct NP cell subpopulations. Hence, we provide evidence that the immortalization strategy that we applied is capable of detecting cell heterogeneity in the NP. Our cell lines yield novel insights into NP biology and provide promising new tools for studies of IVD development, cell function and disease.((PMID:24608928))Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries are extremely valuable for the genome-wide genetic dissection of complex organisms. The Siberian tiger, one of the most well-known wild primitive carnivores in China, is an endangered animal. In order to promote research on its genome, a high-redundancy BAC library of the Siberian tiger was constructed and characterized. The library is divided into two sub-libraries prepared from blood cells and two sub-libraries prepared from fibroblasts. This BAC library contains 153,600 individually archived clones; for PCR-based screening of the library, BACs were placed into 40 superpools of 10 × 384-deep well microplates. The average insert size of BAC clones was estimated to be 116.5 kb, representing approximately 6.46 genome equivalents of the haploid genome and affording a 98.86% statistical probability of obtaining at least one clone containing a unique DNA sequence. Screening the library with 19 microsatellite markers and a SRY sequence revealed that each of these markers were present in the library; the average number of positive clones per marker was 6.74 (range 2 to 12), consistent with 6.46 coverage of the tiger genome. Additionally, we identified 72 microsatellite markers that could potentially be used as genetic markers. This BAC library will serve as a valuable resource for physical mapping, comparative genomic study and large-scale genome sequencing in the tiger.((PMID:26455178))To explore the conditions of synovial derived mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) differentiating into the fibrocartilage cells by using the orthogonal experiment.The synovium was harvested from 5 adult New Zealand white rabbits, and SMSCs were separated by adherence method. The flow cytometry and multi-directional differentiation method were used to identify the SMSCs. The conditions were found from the preliminary experiment and literature review. The missing test was carried out to screen the conditions and then 12 conditions were used for the orthogonal experiment, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2), dexamethasone (DEX), proline, ascorbic acid (ASA), pyruvic acid, insulin + transferrin + selenious acid pre-mixed solution (ITS), bovin serum albumin (BSA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), intermittent hydraulic pressure (IHP), bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP-7), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). The L60 (212) orthogonal experiment was designed using the SPSS 18.0 with 2 level conditions and the cells were induced to differentiate on the small intestinal submucosa (SIS)-3D scaffold. The CD151+/CD44+ cells were detected with the flow cytometry and then the differentiation rate was recorded. The immumohistochemical staining, cellular morphology, toluidine blue staining, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR examination for the gene expressions of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 gene (Sox9), aggrecan gene (AGN), collagen type I gene (Col I), collagen type II gene (Col II), collagen type IX gene (Col IX) were used for result confirmation. The differentiation rate was calculated as the product of CD151/CD44+ cells and cells with Col I high expression. The grow curve was detected with the DNA abundance using the PicoGreen Assay. The visual observation and the variances analysis among the variable were used to evaluate the result of the orthogonal experiment, 1 level interaction was considered. The q-test and the least significant difference (LDS) were used for the variance analysis with a type III calibration model. The test criteria (a) was 0.05.The cells were certified as SMSCs, the double-time of the cells was 28 hours. During the differentiation into the fibrocartilage, the volume of the SIS-3D scaffold enlarged double every 5 days. The scaffolds were positively stained by toluidine blue at 14 days. The visual observation showed that high levels of TGF-β1 and BMP-7 were optimum for the differentiation, and BMP-7 showed the interaction with BMP-2. The conditions of DEX, ASA, ITS, transferrin, bFGF showed decreasing promotional function by degrees, and the model showed the perfect relevance. P value was 0.000 according to the variance analysis. The intercept analysis showed different independent variables brought about variant contribution; the TGF-β1, ASA, bFGF, IGF, and BMP-7 were more remarkable, which were similar to the visual observation.In the process of the SMSCs differentiation into the fibrocartilage, the concentrations of TGF-β1, ASA, bFGF, and IGF reasonably can improve the conversion rate of the fibrocartilage cells. The accurate conditions of the reaulatory factor should be explored further.((PMID:22960220))Retinoid-inducible gene 1 (RIG1), also called tazarotene-induced gene 3, belongs to the HREV107 gene family, which contains five members in humans. RIG1 is expressed in high levels in well-differentiated tissues, but its expression is decreased in cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. We found RIG1 to be highly expressed in testicular cells. When RIG1 was expressed in NT2/D1 testicular cancer cells, neither cell death nor cell viability was affected. However, RIG1 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in NT2/D1 cells. We found that prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) interacted with RIG1 using yeast two-hybrid screens. Further, we found PTGDS to be co-localized with RIG1 in NT2/D1 testis cells. In RIG1-expressing cells, elevated levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), cAMP, and SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (SOX9) were observed. This indicated that RIG1 can enhance PTGDS activity. Silencing of PTGDS expression significantly decreased RIG1-mediated cAMP and PGD2 production. Furthermore, silencing of PTGDS or SOX9 alleviated RIG1-mediated suppression of migration and invasion. These results suggest that RIG1 will suppress cell migration/invasion through the PGD2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, RIG1 can interact with PTGDS to enhance its function and to further suppress NT2/D1 cell migration and invasion. Our study suggests that RIG1-PGD2 signaling might play an important role in cancer cell suppression in the testis.((PMID:20941779))The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, and particularly between mouse and other mammals. To evaluate SRY function in a nonrodent species, we produced an antibody against goat SRY and used it to investigate the expression pattern of SRY throughout goat testicular development. By contrast with the mouse, SRY is primarily expressed in most cells of XY genital-ridges and not solely in pre-Sertoli cells. Between cord formation and prepuberty, SRY remains expressed in both Sertoli and germinal cells. During adulthood, SRY expression declines and then disappears from meiotic germ cells, only remaining present at low levels in some spermatogonia. Unlike the germinal lineage, SRY continues to be highly expressed in adult Sertoli cells with a typical nuclear staining. Our data indicate that in goat, the role of SRY may not be limited to testis determination and could have other functions in testicular maintenance and hence male fertility.((PMID:16765952))The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, particularly between mouse and other mammals, both in terms of protein structure and of expression regulation. To evaluate SRY phylogenic conservation in regards to its function, we expressed the goat gene (gSRY) in XX transgenic mouse gonads. Here, we show that gSRY induces testis formation, despite a goat expression profile. Our results demonstrate that sex-reversal can be induced in XX-mice by a non-mouse SRY thus suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism of action of this testis-determining gene across mammalian species.((PMID:14684983))In mammals, the Y-located SRY gene is known to induce testis formation from the indifferent gonad. A related gene, SOX9, also plays a critical role in testis differentiation in mammals, in birds and reptiles. It is now assumed that SRY acts upstream of SOX9 in the sex determination cascade, but the regulatory link which should exist between these two genes remains unknown. Studies on XX sex reversal in polled goats (PIS mutation: Polled Intersex Syndrome) have led to the discovery of a female-specific locus crucial for ovarian differentiation. This genomic region is composed of at least two genes, FOXL2 and PISRT1, which share a common transcriptional regulatory region, PIS. In this review, we present the expression pattern of these PIS-regulated genes in mice. The FOXL2 expression profile of mice is similar to that described in goats in accordance with a conserved role of this ovarian differentiating gene in mammals. On the contrary, the PISRT1 expression profile is different between mice and goats, suggesting different mechanisms of the primary switch in the testis determination process within mammals. A model based on two different modes of SOX9 regulation in mice and other mammals is proposed in order to integrate our results into the current scheme of gonad differentiation.((PMID:11678506))SOX genes are a family of genes that encode for proteins which are characterised by the presence of a HMG-domain related to that of the mammalian sex-determining gene (SRY). By definition, the DNA binding domain of SOX genes is at least 50% identical to the 79 amino acid HMG domain of the SRY gene. We report here two HMG-box sequences from two microbat species (R. ferrumequinum and P. Pipistrellus) which were PCR amplified using a primer pair specific to the mouse Sry HMG-box. The high percentage of identity of this sequences with the human and mouse SOX30 HMG-box suggests that they are the SOX30 HMG-box for these two bat species.((PMID:9858707))Concentration of maternal BICOID (BCD) establishes the anterior pattern in the Drosophila embryo. Successive deletions in the bcd promoter allowed us to localize an enhancer sequence in the 5'-UTR and a down-regulating element downstream of the ATG initiator codon, and identify a 49 bp region sufficient to drive transcription of a reporter gene specifically in nurse cells. This fragment contains two binding sites for the Serendipity (Sry) d zinc finger activator, that mediate its cooperative binding. Both sites (sdbs) are essential for bcd expression. Further analysis showed that the bcd promoter configuration is decisive for Sry d activating function. Replacement of sdbs by binding sites for Sry b, the Sry d paralog, restores bcd transcription in sry d mutant ovaries, demonstrating that the functional divergence between these two proteins during evolution was mainly driven by changes in their DNA-specific recognition properties, resulting in the control of separate developmental pathways.((PMID:27103433))The drug discovery research for cholestatic liver diseases has been hampered by the lack of a well-established human cholangiocyte model. Functional cholangiocyte-like cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are expected to be a promising candidate for such research, but there remains no well-established method for differentiating cholangiocytes from human iPS cells. In this study, we searched for a suitable extracellular matrix to promote cholangiocyte differentiation from human iPS cells, and found that both laminin 411 and laminin 511 were suitable for this purpose. The gene expression levels of the cholangiocyte markers, aquaporin 1 (AQP1), SRY-box 9 (SOX9), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1), Jagged 1 (JAG1), secretin receptor (SCTR), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT1) were increased by using laminin 411 or laminin 511 as a matrix. In addition, the percentage of AQP1-positive cells was increased from 61.8% to 92.5% by using laminin 411 or laminin 511. Furthermore, the diameter and number of cysts consisted of cholangiocyte-like cells were increased when using either matrix. We believe that the human iPS cell-derived cholangiocyte-like cells, which were generated by using our differentiation technology, would be useful for the drug discovery research of cholestatic liver diseases.((PMID:17143943))To investigate the effect of transplanted fetal liver epithelial progenitor (FLEP) cells on liver fibrosis in mice.FLEP cells were isolated from embryonal day (ED) 14 BALB/c mice and transplanted into female syngenic BALB/c mice (n = 60). After partial hepatectomy (PH), diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was administered to induce liver fibrosis. Controls received FLEP cells and non-supplemented drinking water, the model group received DEN-spiked water, and the experimental group received FLEP cells and DEN. Mice were killed after 1, 2, and 3 mo, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hyaluronic acid (HA), and laminin (LN) in serum, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in liver were assessed. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) of liver was tested by immunohistochemistry. Transplanted male mice FLEP cells were identified by immunocytochemistry for sry (sex determination region for Y chromosome) protein.Serum ALT, AST, HA, and LN were markedly reduced by transplanted FLEP cells. Liver Hyp content and alpha-SMA staining in mice receiving FLEP cells were lower than that of the model group, which was consistent with altered liver pathology. Transplanted cells proliferated and differentiated into hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells with 30%-50% repopulation in the liver fibrosis induced by DEN after 3 mo.Transplanted FLEP cells proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells with high repopulation capacity in the fiberized liver induced by DEN, which restores liver function and reduces liver fibrosis.((PMID:11122249))The autoimmune nature of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is well established. We tested the hypothesis that fetal microchimerism indicated by the persistence of circulating fetal cells in women years after pregnancy might contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of PBC through a graft-versus-host-like response. We extracted DNA from the peripheral blood cells of 36 women carefully selected from 173 consecutive PBC patients, who were matched with 36 healthy women by age, age of last son, and number of children. Both patients and controls had to have male offspring, and no history of miscarriages or blood transfusions; they could not be twins. We tested all of the samples for the presence of two specific Y-chromosome sequences (SY154 and SRY) by amplifying DNA in a nested polymerase chain reaction. Y-chromosome-specific DNA was detected in the peripheral blood cell DNA of 13 (36%) of the 36 women with PBC and in 11 (31%) of the 36 healthy controls. The two groups of PBC patients with and without male DNA sequences were similar in terms of their clinical, biochemical, and serological features. Y-chromosome sequences were found in three of the four PBC women with associated systemic sclerosis. All of the 24 Y-positive samples contained SY154 sequences, but only three PBC patients and six controls showed the presence of both SY154 and SRY sequences. This discrepancy may suggest that not only fetal cells but also fragments of fetal DNA are present in maternal circulation. Overall, our data do not support the hypothesis that fetal microchimerism plays a significant role in the onset or progression of PBC.((PMID:27185484))Developmental exposure to arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands abolishes sex differences in a wide range of neural structures and functions. A well-studied example is the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), a structure that controls sex-specific luteinizing hormone (LH) release. In the male, testosterone (T) secreted by the developing testes defeminizes LH release mechanisms; conversely, perinatal AhR activation by 2,3,7,8,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) blocks defeminization. To better understand developmental mechanisms altered by TCDD exposure, we first verified that neonatal TCDD exposure in male rats prevented the loss of AVPV GABA/glutamate neurons that are critical for female-typical LH surge release. We then used whole genome arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to compare AVPV transcriptomes of males treated neonatally with TCDD or vehicle. Our bioinformatics analyses showed that TCDD enriched gene sets important for neuron development, synaptic transmission, ion homeostasis, and cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, upstream regulatory analysis suggests that both estrogen receptors (ER) and androgen receptors (AR) regulate genes targeted by TCDD. Of the 23 mRNAs found to be changed by TCDD at least 2-fold (p<0.05), most participate in the functions identified in our bioinformatics analyses. Several, including matrix metallopeptidase 9 and SRY-box 11 (Sox11), are known targets of E2. CUG triplet repeat, RNA binding protein 2 (cugbp2) is particularly interesting because it is sex-specific, oppositely regulated by estradiol (E2) and TCDD. Moreover, it regulates the post-transcriptional processing of molecules previously linked to sexual differentiation of the brain. These findings provide new insights into how TCDD may interfere with defeminization of LH release patterns.((PMID:24962540))Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level is a clinically important quantitative phenotype that widely varies among inbred mouse strains. Several genes or loci associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels have been identified on autosomes and the X chromosome. In contrast, genes or loci on the Y chromosome have not attracted significant attention hitherto. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the Y chromosome on plasma HDL-cholesterol levels in Y- chromosome-consomic (Y-consomic) mouse strains.Plasma HDL-cholesterol level data from 16 Y-consomic strains demonstrated that the Y chromosome substitutions significantly altered plasma HDL-cholesterol levels, i.e., variations in the plasma HDL-cholesterol level could be partially explained by Y chromosome genes. We obtained the following results from the genotype data on 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs and 9 polymorphisms in Sry: (1) Variation in rs46947134 of Uty was significantly associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. (2) A CAG repeat number polymorphism in Sry was significantly associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. (3) Strains with a certain haplotype of the Mus musculus domesticus-type Y chromosome had significantly lower plasma HDL-cholesterol levels than strains with a certain haplotype of the M. m. musculus-type Y chromosome.The effect of the Y chromosome on plasma HDL-cholesterol levels was confirmed in the Y-consomic strains. We identified several variants associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. Because the physiological significance of various Y-linked genes remains unclear, the results of this study will provide further insights into the functions of Y-linked genes in lipid metabolism.((PMID:22128028))Genome analysis of patients with disorders of sex development, and gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice indicate that gonadal development is regulated by opposing signals. In females, the Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway blocks testicular differentiation by repressing the expression of the Sertoli cell-specific gene Sox9 by an unknown mechanism. Using cell and embryonic gonad culture models, we show that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibits the expression of Sox9 and Amh, whereas mRNA and protein levels of Sry and steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1), two key transcriptional regulators of Sox9, are not altered. Ectopic activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in male gonads led to a loss of Sf1 binding to the Tesco enhancer and absent Sox9 expression that we also observed in wild-type ovaries. Moreover, ectopic Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced the expression of the female somatic cell markers, Bmp2 and Rspo1, as a likely consequence of Sox9 loss. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in XY gonads did not, however, affect gene expression of the steroidogenic Leydig cell Sf1 target gene, Cyp11a1, or Sf1 binding to the Cyp11a1 promoter. Our data support a model in ovary development whereby activation of β-catenin prevents Sf1 binding to the Sox9 enhancer, thereby inhibiting Sox9 expression and Sertoli cell differentiation.((PMID:21938520))Niemann-Pick type C 1 (NPC1) disease is an autosomal recessive cholesterol transport defect resulting in a neurodegenerative process in patients mainly at an early age, although some patients may start with manifestation in adult. Since loss of myelin is considered as a main pathogenetic factor, the precise mechanism inducing dysmylination in NPC1 disease is still unclear. In the present study, a quantitative evaluation on the myelin protein and its regulatory factors of oligodendrocytes, such as SRY-related HMG-box 10 (Sox10), Yin Yang 1 factor (YY1) and myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF), in different parts of the brain and spinal cord was performed in NPC1-mutant mice. The results showed that NPC1 protein was expressed in oligodendrocytes and the amount of myelin protein was generally decreased in all parts of the brain and spinal cord in NPC1-mutant mice. Compared to wild type, the amount of Sox10 and YY1 was not different in NPC1-mutant mice, but MRF was significantly decreased, suggesting a possible mechanism perturbing differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the myelination process in the NPC1-mutant mouse.((PMID:18971546))Excess cardiovascular risk in men compared with women has been suggested to be partly explained by effects of the Y chromosome. However, inconsistent results have been reported on the Y chromosome's genetic influence on blood pressure and lipid levels. The purpose of the present study was to settle the question whether genetic variants of the Y chromosome influence cardiovascular risk factors using a large epidemiological cohort, the Suita study. Possible influences of the Y chromosome polymorphisms (Y chromosome Alu insertion polymorphism [YAP], M175 and SRY+465) on cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 974 Japanese men. The frequency of the YAP(+) allele in our study sample was 0.31. The prevalence of hypertension tended to be higher in YAP(+) than in YAP(-) men, and this tendency was found to be stronger among men aged 65 years or older. Men with the YAP(+) genotype had higher levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with those with the YAP(-) genotype, even after adjustment for age, body mass index, and daily ethanol and cigarette consumption (57.0+/-14.6 mg/dL vs. 54.2+/-14.2 mg/dL, nominal p=0.011, adjusted p=0.0062). However, these observed nominal associations disappeared after adjusting for multiple testing (Bonferroni). No association was detected between the YAP genotype and myocardial infarction. Similarly, none of the associations with M175 and SRY+465 attained significance when multiple testing was taken into account. In conclusion, Y chromosome polymorphisms (YAP, M175 and SRY+465) do not appear to be associated with cardiovascular risk factors in Japanese men. Studies using much larger sample sizes and/or additional independent samples will be required for definitive conclusions.((PMID:17192299))The phenotype in Turner syndrome (TS) is variable, even in patients with a supposedly nonmosaic karyotype. Previous work suggested that there were X-linked parent-of-origin effects on the phenotype.The TS phenotype is influenced by the parental origin of the missed X chromosome.This was a multicenter prospective study of TS patients and both their parents, determining parental origin of the X-chromosome, and characterizing the clinical phenotype.Eighty-three TS patients and their parents were studied. Inclusion criteria were TS with karyotype 45,X or 46Xi(Xq). Four highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on the X-chromosome DMD49, DYSII, DXS1283, and the androgen receptor gene and three Y chromosome markers, SRY, DYZ1, and DYZ3.The study determined the correlation between the parental origin of the X chromosome and the unique phenotypic traits of TS including congenital malformations, anthropometry and growth pattern, skeletal defects, endocrine traits, education, and vocation.Eighty-three percent of 45,X retained their maternal X (X(m)), whereas 64% 46Xi(Xq) retained their paternal X (X(p), P < 0.001). Kidney malformations were exclusively found in X(m) patients (P = 0.030). The X(m) group had lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.003), and higher body mass index sd score (P = 0.030) that was not maintained after GH treatment. Response to GH therapy was comparable. Ocular abnormalities were more common in the paternal X group (P = 0.017), who also had higher academic achievement.The parental origin of the missing short arm of the X chromosome has an impact on overweight, kidney, eye, and lipids, which suggests a potential effect of an as-yet-undetermined X chromosome gene imprinting.((PMID:15581876))Genes previously implicated in mammalian sexual development have either a male- or female-specific role. The signaling molecule WNT4 has been shown to be important in female sexual development. Lack of Wnt4 gives rise to masculinization of the XX gonad and we showed previously that the role of WNT4 was to inhibit endothelial and steroidogenic cell migration into the developing ovary. Here we show that Wnt4 also has a function in the male gonad. We find that Sertoli cell differentiation is compromised in Wnt4 mutant testes and that this defect occurs downstream of the testis-determining gene Sry but upstream of Sox9 and Dhh, two early Sertoli cell markers. Genetic analysis shows that this phenotype is primarily due to the action of WNT4 within the early genital ridge. Analysis of different markers identifies the most striking difference in the genital ridge at early stages of its development between wild-type and Wnt4 mutant embryos to be a significant increase of steroidogenic cells in the Wnt4 -/- gonad. These results identify WNT4 as a new factor involved in the mammalian testis determination pathway and show that genes can have a specific but distinct role in both male and female gonad development.((PMID:14582455))The effects of apolipoprotein (Apo) AI mimetic peptide synthesized from D- and L-amino acids on atherosclerotic lesion formation were investigated in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient mice on a Western diet and in apoE null mice. In addition, their effects on the inflammatory changes induced in LDL-receptor mice fed a Western diet following influenza A infection were studied. When apolipoprotein AI mimetic peptides synthesized from either D- or L-amino acids were administered to LDL-receptor null mice, only peptides synthesized from D-amino acids were stable in the circulation and enhanced the ability of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to protect LDL against oxidation. Administration of the peptide D-4F to LDL-receptor null mice and apoE null mice decreased lesion size. Additionally, in LDL receptor null mice after influenza infection, D-4F treatment increased plasma HDL levels and paraoxonase activity, and inhibited increased in LDL-cholesterol and peak levels of interleukin-6 post-infection. Injection of female mice with male macrophages, and subsequent measurement of the male 'sry' gene, revealed a marked increase in macrophage traffic into the aortic arch after infection that was prevented by administration of D-4F. This indicates that: (i) oral D-4F has powerful anti-atherosclerotic properties, and (ii) the loss of the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL after influenza infection in mice is associated with increased arterial macrophage traffic that can be prevented by administration of D-4F.((PMID:12223418))In mammals, Sry expression in the bipotential, undifferentiated gonad directs the support cell precursors to differentiate as Sertoli cells, thus initiating the testis differentiation pathway. In the absence of Sry, or if Sry is expressed at insufficient levels, the support cell precursors differentiate as granulosa cells, thus initiating the ovarian pathway. The molecular mechanisms upstream and downstream of Sry are not well understood. We demonstrate that the transcription factor GATA4 and its co-factor FOG2 are required for gonadal differentiation. Mouse fetuses homozygous for a null allele of Fog2 or homozygous for a targeted mutation in Gata4 (Gata4(ki)) that abrogates the interaction of GATA4 with FOG co-factors exhibit abnormalities in gonadogenesis. We found that Sry transcript levels were significantly reduced in XY Fog2(-/-) gonads at E11.5, which is the time when Sry expression normally reaches its peak. In addition, three genes crucial for normal Sertoli cell function (Sox9, Mis and Dhh) and three Leydig cell steroid biosynthetic enzymes (p450scc, 3betaHSD and p450c17) were not expressed in XY Fog2(-/-) and Gata(ki/ki) gonads, whereas Wnt4, a gene required for normal ovarian development, was expressed ectopically. By contrast, Wt1 and Sf1, which are expressed prior to Sry and necessary for gonad development in both sexes, were expressed normally in both types of mutant XY gonads. These results indicate that GATA4 and FOG2 and their physical interaction are required for normal gonadal development.((PMID:12196340))We reported that HDL loses its antiinflammatory properties during acute influenza A infection in mice, and we hypothesized that these changes might be associated with increased trafficking of macrophages into the artery wall. The present study tested this hypothesis.D-4F, an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide, or vehicle in which it was dissolved (PBS) was administered daily to LDL receptor-null mice after a Western diet and after influenza infection. D-4F treatment increased plasma HDL cholesterol and paraoxonase activity compared with PBS and inhibited increases in LDL cholesterol and peak levels of interleukin-6 after infection. Lung viral titers were reduced by 50% in mice receiving D-4F. Injection of female mice with male macrophages, which were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the male Sry gene, revealed a marked increase in macrophage traffic into the aortic arch and innominate arteries after infection that was prevented by administration of D-4F.We conclude that loss of antiinflammatory properties of HDL after influenza infection in mice is associated with increased arterial macrophage traffic that can be prevented by administration of D-4F.((PMID:11076952))A testicular form of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL(tes)), a triacylglycerol lipase, and cholesterol esterase, is expressed in male germ cells. Northern blot analysis showed HSL(tes) mRNA expression in early spermatids. Immunolocalization of the protein in human and rodent seminiferous tubules indicated that the highest level of expression occurred in elongated spermatids. We have previously shown that 0.5 kilobase pairs of the human HSL(tes) promoter directs testis-specific expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transgenic mice and determined regions binding nuclear proteins expressed in testis but not in liver (Blaise, R., Grober, J., Rouet, P., Tavernier, G., Daegelen, D., and Langin, D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 9327-9334). Mutation of a SRY/Sox-binding site in one of the regions did not impair in vivo testis-specific expression of the reporter gene. Further transgenic analyses established that 95 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site were sufficient for correct testis expression. In gel retardation assays using early spermatid nuclear extracts, a germ cell-specific DNA-protein interaction was mapped between -46 and -29 base pairs. The DNA binding nuclear protein showed properties of zinc finger transcription factors. Mutation of the region abolished reporter gene activity in transgenic mice, showing that it is necessary for testis expression of HSL(tes).((PMID:7671103))Patients with ambiguous genitalia stand a far better chance of receiving a rapid diagnosis, appropriate replacement therapy, and functional surgical reconstruction than was the case even a decade ago. Although the etiologies of true hermaphroditism and mixed gonadal dysgenesis remain elusive, most gene defects in female pseudohermaphroditism or CAH have been pinpointed to the 21-hydroxylase gene. Incomplete masculinization has been found to be due to defects in the androgen receptor, 5 alpha-reductase, or enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to testosterone. SRY point mutations have been implicated in 46XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. Retained müllerian ducts have been attributed to point mutations in the MIS gene; those with normal MIS levels should be expected to have receptor deficits. In utero diagnoses and treatment and diagnosis at the preimplantation stage may prove to be very important for the care of some of these patients, who may be potential candidates for gene replacement therapy. When necessary, surgical reconstruction can be done. If the child is to be raised as a female, clitoral recession, labioscrotal reductions and advancements, and vaginoplasties for exteriorization can be accomplished in early infancy as an extensive one-stage procedure. If patients are to be raised as males, then various types of hypospadias repair can be done, gonads can be replaced with prostheses, the prepenile scrotum can be reconstructed, and müllerian structures can be removed with the goal of preserving the vas deferens. Replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids must be precisely managed to permit proper growth, and testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone replacement must be carefully considered and managed. A most important element in the care of these patients is the psychological support that first the families and then the patient require. This must be delivered with sensitivity. The proper care of these complex patients requires that the physician be a scientist as well as a clinician and a skilled technician.((PMID:8013361))It is well known that fetal androgens are required for male sexual differentiation, and it is thought that fetal ovaries are not steroidogenically active. However, molecular details, such as which steroidogenic enzymes are present in fetal testes and which enzymes are absent in fetal ovaries, have not been established. The pattern of expression of the genes that encode four of the steroidogenic enzymes necessary for androgen and estrogen production was examined during fetal development in mouse gonads. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase (3 beta HSD), P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (P450c17), and P450 aromatase (P450arom) was determined before ovaries and testes were distinguishable (13 days postconception) and during sexual differentiation (15, 17, and 20 days postconception) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). A PCR assay for Sry was used to determine gender on day 13. P450scc, 3 beta HSD, and P450c17 transcripts were detected at all ages in fetal testes, indicating that mRNAs for the steroidogenic enzymes that are required to convert cholesterol to androgens are present in the male gonad even before sexual differentiation. P450arom mRNA was detected in several fetal testes on day 17, but consistently observed on day 20. The expression of P450arom suggests the potential of fetal and neonatal testes to convert androgens to estrogens. In contrast, although 3 beta HSD mRNA was detected in several of the ovaries examined, the detection of P450scc, P450c17, and P450arom transcripts was rare. These data suggest that the absence of fetal ovarian steroid hormone production is the result of lack of expression of at least three of the steroidogenic enzymes, P450scc, P450c17, and P450arom.((PMID:26377202))MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that pave a new avenue for understanding immune responses and cancer progression. Although the miRNAs are involved in breast cancer development, their axis with the transcription factors that show therapeutic potential in breast cancer is largely unknown. Previous studies showed anti-metastatic roles of agonist-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) in various breast cancer cell lines. Recently, we demonstrated that agonist-activated Ahr induced a highly conserved miRNA cluster, named miR-212/132, in murine cellular immune compartment. Therefore, current study was performed to examine if this miRNA cluster mediates the anti-metastatic properties of Ahr agonists.The expression of miR-212/132 cluster and coding genes were examined by real-time PCR, and the protein levels were detected by western blot. The 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) were used to activate Ahr in MDA-MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to identify the binding site(s) for Ahr on miR-212/132 promoter. For prediction of potentially target gene of the miRNA cluster, bioinformatics analysis was carried out, and to test targeting, luciferase activity was quantified. Besides, biological effects of Ahr-miR-212/132 axis were examined in vitro by cell migration, expansion and invasion, and examined in vivo by orthotopic model of spontaneous metastasis.The miR-212/132 cluster was transcriptionally activated in MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells by TCDD and DIM, and this activation was regulated by Ahr. A reciprocal correlation was identified between Ahr agonists-induced miR-212/132 and the pro-metastatic SRY-related HMG-box4 (SOX4), and a new specific binding sites for miR-212/132 were identified on the untranslated region (3'UTR) of SOX4. Interestingly, miR-212/132 over-expression showed direct anti-migration, anti-expansion and anti-invasion properties, and an inhibition of the miRNA cluster mitigated the anti-invasive properties of TCDD and DIM. Further in vivo studies demonstrated that the Ahr-miR-212/132-SOX4 module was induced by Ahr activation.Taken together, the findings provide the first evidences of the synergistic anti-metastatic properties of miR-212/132 cluster through suppression of SOX4. Also, current study suggest a new miRNA-based mechanism elucidating the anti-metastatic properties of Ahr agonists, suggesting possibility of using miR-212/132 to control metastasis in breast cancer patients.((PMID:11850237))Teleost fish are characterized by exceptionally high levels of brain estrogen biosynthesis when compared to the brains of other vertebrates or to the ovaries of the same fish. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) have utility as complementary models for understanding the molecular basis and functional significance of exaggerated neural estrogen biosynthesis. Multiple cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) cDNAs that derive from separate gene loci (cyp19a and cyp19b) are differentially expressed in brain (P450aromB>A) and ovary (P450aromA>B) and have a different developmental program (B>A) and response to estrogen upregulation (B only). As measured by increased P450aromB mRNA, a functional estrogen response system is first detected 24-48 h post-fertilization (hpf), consistent with the onset of estrogen receptor (ER) expression (alpha, beta, and gamma). The 5'-flanking region of the cyp19b gene has a TATA box, two estrogen response elements (EREs), an ERE half-site (ERE1/2), a nerve growth factor inducible-B protein (NGFI-B)/Nur77 responsive element (NBRE) binding site, and a sequence identical to the zebrafish GATA-2 gene neural specific enhancer. The cyp19a promoter region has TATA and CAAT boxes, a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site, and two aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator factor (ARNT) binding motifs. Both genes have multiple potential SRY/SOX binding sites (16 and 8 in cyp19b and cyp19a, respectively). Luciferase reporters have basal promoter activity in GH3 cells, but differences (a>b) are opposite to fish pituitary (b>a). When microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs, a cyp19b promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (but not cyp19a) is expressed in neurons of 30-48 hpf embryos, most prominently in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their projections to optic tectum. Further studies are required to identify functionally relevant cis-elements and cellular factors, and to determine the regulatory role of estrogen in neurodevelopment.((PMID:27068235))Diet and microbiome derived indole derivatives are known to activate the ligand induced transcription factor, the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). While the current understanding of AhR biology has confirmed its role in mucosal lymphocytes, its function in intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) is poorly understood. Here, we report that Cre-mediated deletion of AhR in CD11c-expressing cells in C57/BL6 mice is associated with altered intestinal epithelial morphogenesis in vivo. Moreover, when co-cultured with AhR-deficient DCs ex vivo, intestinal organoids showed reduced SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 and increased Mucin 2 expression, which correlates with reduced Paneth cells and increased goblet cell differentiation, similar to the data obtained in vivo. Further, characterization of intestinal APC subsets, devoid of AhR, revealed an expression pattern associated with aberrant intrinsic Wnt pathway regulation. At a functional level, the loss of AhR in APCs resulted in a dysfunctional epithelial barrier, associated with a more aggressive chemically induced colitis compared to wild type animals. Our results are consistent with a model whereby the AhR signalling pathway may participate in the regulation of innate immunity through intestinal epithelium development and mucosal immunity.((PMID:11738553))Teleost fish are characterized by exceptionally high levels of neural estrogen biosynthesis when compared with the brains of other vertebrates or to the ovaries of the same fish. Two P450arom mRNAs which derive from separate gene loci (cyp19a and cyp19b) are differentially expressed in brain (b>a) and ovary (a>b) and have a different developmental program (b>a) and estrogen upregulation (b only). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genomic walking strategy was used to isolate the 5'-flanking regions of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) cyp19 genes. Sequence analysis of the cyp19b gene approximately 1.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site revealed a TATA box at nucleotide (nt) -30, two estrogen responsive elements (EREs; nt -351 and -211) and a consensus binding site (NBRE) for nerve growth factor inducible-B protein (NGFI-B/Nur77) at -286, which includes another ERE half-site. Also present were a sequence at nt -399 (CCCTCCT) required for neural specificity of the zebrafish GATA-2 gene, and 16 copies of an SRY/SOX binding motif. The 5'-flanking region ( approximately 1.0 kb) of the cyp19a gene had TATA (nt -48) and CAAT (nt -71) boxes, a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site (nt -265), eight copies of the SRY/SOX motif, and two copies of a recognition site for binding the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator factor (ARNT) heterodimer. Both genes had elements previously identified in the brain specific exon I promoter of the mouse aromatase gene. Cyp19a- and -b/luciferase constructs showed basal promoter activity in aromatase-expressing rodent pituitary (GH3) cells, but differences (a>b) did not reflect expression in fish pituitary in vivo (b>a), implying a lack of appropriate cell factors. Consistent with the onset of cyp19b expression in zebrafish embryos, microinjection of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid into fertilized eggs revealed labeling in neural tissues at 30-48 h post-fertilization (hpf), most prominently in retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and axon-like projections to the optic tectum. Expression of a cyp19a/GFP reporter was not detectable up to 72 hpf. Tandem analysis of cyp19a and cyp19b promoters in living zebrafish embryos can be a useful approach for identifying cis-elements and cellular factors involved in the correct tissue-specific, spatial, temporal and estrogen regulated expression of aromatase genes during CNS and gonadal development.((PMID:24558194))Intervertebral disc degeneration is the leading cause of chronic back pain. Recent studies show that raised level of SDC4, a cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, plays a role in pathogenesis of disc degeneration. However, in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells of the healthy intervertebral disc, the mechanisms that control expression of SDC4 and its physiological function are unknown. Hypoxia induced SDC4 mRNA and protein expression by ~2.4- and 4.4-fold (P<0.05), respectively, in NP cells. While the activity of the SDC4 promoter containing hypoxia response element (HRE) was induced 2-fold (P<0.05), the HRE mutation decreased the activity by 40% in hypoxia. Transfections with plasmids coding prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) and ShPHD2 show that hypoxic expression of SDC4 mRNA and protein is regulated by PHD2 through controlling hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) levels. Although overexpression of HIF-1α significantly increased SDC4 protein levels, stable suppression of HIF-1α and HIF-1β decreased SDC4 expression by 50% in human NP cells. Finally, suppression of SDC4 expression, as well as HS function, resulted in an ~2-fold increase in sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 (Sox9) mRNA, and protein (P<0.05) and simultaneous increase in Sox9 transcriptional activity and target gene expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that in healthy discs, SDC4, through its HS side chains, contributes to maintenance of the hypoxic tissue niche by controlling baseline expression of Sox9.((PMID:23962688))We report isolation of novel splice variants of chicken Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 3 (cNPAS3) gene distinct from the previously predicted cNPAS3 at the 5' end. Newly identified cNPAS3 splice variants feature N-terminus coding sequences with high degrees of homology to human NPAS3 (hNAPS3). We also show that the alternative splicing pattern of NPAS3 is conserved between chicken and human. RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of cNPAS3 in the developing central nervous system (CNS) is limited to the ventricular zone and only partially overlaps with that of chicken Reelin (cReelin), the only known regulatory target gene of NPAS3 in the adult brain. Overexpression of cNPAS3 by in ovo electroporation had little effect on the expression of Sox2, a marker for neural precursors, or of Isl1/2, a marker for early differentiating motor neurons. Taken together with the little effect of cNPAS3 overexpression on cReelin, it is noted that the function of NPAS3 in the developing CNS remains to be determined. Still, identification of proper cDNA sequences for cNPAS3 should represent a solid beginning of the understanding process.((PMID:18247374))Epidermal keratinocytes respond to extracellular influences by activating cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways that change gene expression. Using pathway-specific transcriptional profiling, we identified the genes regulated by two such pathways, p38 and ERK. These pathways are at the fulcrum of epidermal differentiation, proliferative and inflammatory skin diseases. We used SB203580 and PD98059 as specific inhibitors and Affymetrix Hu133Av2 microarrays, to identify the genes regulated after 1, 4, 24, and 48 h and compared them to genes regulated by JNK. Unexpectedly, inhibition of MAPK pathways is compensated by activation of the NFkappaB pathway and suppression of the DUSP enzymes. Both pathways promote epidermal differentiation; however, there is a surprising disconnect between the expression of steroid synthesis enzymes and differentiation markers. The p38 pathway induces the expression of extracellular matrix and proliferation-associated genes, while suppressing microtubule-associated genes. The ERK pathway induces nuclear envelope and mRNA splicing proteins, while suppressing steroid synthesis and mitochondrial energy production enzymes. Transcription factors SRY, c-FOS, and N-Myc are the principal targets of the p38 pathway, Elk-1 SAP1 and HLH2 of ERK, while FREAC-4, ARNT and USF are shared. The results suggest a list of targets potentially useful in therapeutic interventions in cutaneous diseases and wound healing.((PMID:25908172))This study was aimed to identify the prognostic risk markers for thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC) by bioinformatics. The clinical data of TPC and their microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes expression profile data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Elastic net-Cox's proportional regression hazards model (EN-COX) was used to identify the prognostic associated factors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve were used to screen the significant prognostic risk miRNA and genes. Then, the target genes of the obtained miRNAs were predicted followed by function prediction. Finally, the significant risk genes were performed literature mining and function analysis. Total 1046 miRNAs and 20531 genes in 484 cases samples were identified after data preprocessing. From the EN-COX model, 30 prognostic risk factors were obtained. Based on the 30 risk factors, 3 miRNAs and 11 genes were identified from the ROC and KM curves. The target genes of miRNA-342 such as B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were mainly enriched in the biological process related to cellular metabolic process and Disease Ontology terms of lymphoma. The target genes of miRNA-93 were mainly enriched in the pathway of G1 phase. Among the 11 prognostic risk genes, v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue F (MAFF), SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 4 (SOX4), and retinoic acid receptor, alpha (RARA) encoded transcription factors. Besides, RARA was enriched in four pathways. These prognostic markers such as miRNA-93, miRNA-342, RARA, MAFF, SOX4, and BCL2 may be used as targets for TPC chemoprevention.((PMID:23968773))The molecular mechanisms governing sex determination and differentiation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) are not fully understood. To gain more insights into the function of specific genes in these complex processes, the expression of multiple candidates needs to be assessed, preferably on the protein level. Here, we developed a targeted proteomics method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to study the candidate sex-related proteins in zebrafish which were selected based on a global proteomics analysis of adult gonads and representational difference analysis of male and female DNA, as well as on published information on zebrafish and other vertebrates. We employed the developed SRM protocols to acquire time-resolved protein expression profiles during the gonad differentiation period in vas::EGFP transgenic zebrafish. Evidence on protein expression was obtained for the first time for several candidate genes previously studied only on the mRNA level or suggested by bioinformatic predictions. Tuba1b (tubulin alpha 1b), initially included in the study as one of the potential housekeeping proteins, was found to be preferentially expressed in the adult testis with nearly absent expression in the ovary. The revealed changes in protein expression patterns associated with gonad differentiation suggest that several of the examined proteins, especially Ilf2 and Ilf3 (interleukin enhancer-binding factors 2 and 3), Raldh3 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 3), Zgc:195027 (low density lipoprotein-related receptor protein 3) and Sept5a (septin 5a), may play a specific role in the sexual differentiation in zebrafish.((PMID:12554773))Dax-1 [dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (NR0B1)] is an orphan nuclear receptor acting as a suppressor of Ad4 binding protein/steroidogenic factor 1 [Ad4BP/SF-1 (NR5A1)] and as an anti-Sry factor in the process of gonadal sex differentiation. The roles of these nuclear receptors in the differentiation of the gonads and the adrenal cortex have been established through studies of the mutant phenotype in both mice and humans. However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of these genes remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between Dax-1 gene transcription and the Wnt4 pathway. Reporter gene analysis revealed that Dax-1 gene transcription was activated by beta-catenin, a key signal-transducing protein in the Wnt pathway, acting in synergy with Ad4BP/SF-1. Interaction between beta-catenin and Ad4BP/SF-1 was observed using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays. The region of Ad4BP/SF-1 essential for this interaction consists of an acidic amino acid cluster, which resides in the first helix of the ligand-binding domain. Mutation of the amino acid cluster impaired transcriptional activation of Dax-1 as well as interaction of Ad4BP/SF-1 with beta-catenin. These results were supported by in vivo observations using Wnt4 gene-disrupted mice, in which Dax-1 gene expression was decreased significantly in sexually differentiating female gonads. We thus conclude that Wnt4 signaling mediates the increased expression of Dax-1 as the ovary becomes sexually differentiated.((PMID:22869781))We recently used three XO male mouse models with varying Y short-arm (Yp) gene complements, analysed at 30 days post partum, to demonstrate a Yp gene requirement for the apoptotic elimination of spermatocytes with a univalent X chromosome at the first meiotic metaphase. The three mouse models were i) XSxr(a)O in which the Yp-derived Tp(Y)1Ct(Sxr-a) sex reversal factor provides an almost complete Yp gene complement, ii) XSxr(b)O,Eif2s3y males in which Tp(Y)1Ct(Sxr-b) has a deletion completely or partially removing eight Yp genes - the Yp gene Eif2s3y has been added as a transgene to support spermatogonial proliferation, and iii) XOSry,Eif2s3y males in which the Sry transgene directs gonad development along the male pathway. In this study, we have used the same mouse models analysed at 6 weeks of age to investigate potential Yp gene involvement in spermiogenesis. We found that all three mouse models produce haploid and diploid spermatids and that the diploid spermatids showed frequent duplication of the developing acrosomal cap during the early stages. However, only in XSxr(a)O males did spermiogenesis continue to completion. Most strikingly, in XOSry,Eif2s3y males, spermatid development arrested at round spermatid step 7 so that no sperm head restructuring or tail development was observed. In contrast, in XSxr(b)O,Eif2s3y males, spermatids with substantial sperm head and tail morphogenesis could be easily found, although this was delayed compared with XSxr(a)O. We conclude that Sxr(a) (and therefore Yp) includes genetic information essential for sperm morphogenesis and that this is partially retained in Sxr(b).((PMID:22626995))Gonads are the only organs with 2 possible developmental pathways, testis or ovary. A consequence of this unique feature is that mutations in genes controlling gonad development give rise not only to gonadal malformation or dysfunction but also to frequent cases of sex reversal, including XY females, XX males and intersexes. Most of our current knowledge on mammalian sex determination, the genetic process by which the gonadal primordia are committed to differentiate as either testes or ovaries, has derived mainly from the study of sex-reversed mice obtained by direct genetic manipulation. However, there are also numerous cases of natural exceptions to normal gonad development which have been described in a variety of mammals, including both domestic and wild species. Here, we review the most relevant cases of: (1) natural, non-induced sex reversal and intersexuality described in laboratory rodents, including Sxr and B6-Y(DOM) mice; (2) sex reversal in domestic animals, including freemartinism in bovids and pigs, XX sex reversal in pigs, goats and dogs, XY sex reversal in the horse, and sex chromosome chimerism and sex reversal in the cat, and (3) sex reversal in wild mammals, including the generalised true hermaphroditism described in talpid moles, XY sex reversal in Akodon, Microtus and Dicrostonyx species, males lacking a Y chromosome and SRY in Ellobius lutescens, the X* chromosome of Myopus schisticolor, and sex chromosome mosaicism and X0 females in Microtus oregoni. These studies are necessary to elucidate particular aspects of mammalian gonad development in some instances and to understand how the genetic mechanisms controlling gonad development have evolved.((PMID:21530259))During male but not female mammalian meiosis, there is efficient apoptotic elimination of cells with unpaired (univalent) chromosomes at the first meiotic metaphase (MI) [1]. Apoptotic elimination of MI spermatocytes is seen in response to the univalent X chromosome of XSxr(a)O male mice [2], in which the X chromosome carries Sxr(a) [3, 4], the Y-chromosome-derived sex-reversal factor that includes the testis determinant Sry. Sxr(b) is an Sxr(a)-derived variant in which a deletion has removed six Y short-arm genes and created a Zfy2/Zfy1 fusion gene spanning the deletion breakpoint [4, 5]. XSxr(b)O males have spermatogonial arrest that can be overcome by the re-addition of Eif2s3y from the deletion as a transgene; however, XSxr(b)OEif2s3y transgenic males do not show the expected elimination of MI spermatocytes in response to the univalent [6]. Here we show that these XSxr(b)OEif2s3y males have an impaired apoptotic response with completion of the first meiotic division, but there is no second meiotic division. We then show that Zfy2 (but not the closely related Zfy1) is sufficient to reinstate the apoptotic response to the X univalent. These findings provide further insight into the basis for the much lower transmission of chromosomal errors originating at the first meiotic division in men than in women [7].((PMID:12036107))Investigations in mice suggest that the Y-chromosomal genes affect certain behaviors. Here, we studied whether a part of the Y chromosome, the Sxr locus, has an effect on induction of motivation for parental care (pup retrieval) or of parental aggression towards pups (infanticide). XX females, XX males with the Sxr locus on the X chromosome, and XY males of the C57BL/6J strain were tested. The induced pup retrieval or infanticide behaviors were genotype-dependent. XX mice always retrieved pups and never were infanticidal. On the first test, significantly more XY males (38%) than XX males (17%) were infanticidal. When the same animals were tested for a second time, all except one of the XX males retrieved pups. Overall, motivation for parental care was highest in XX females, followed by XX males, and lowest in XY mice. On the other hand, the incidence of infanticide was highest in XY males, lower in XX males, and absent in XX females. We conclude that the Sxr locus of the Y chromosome, when operating in a XX background, partially erases but does not fully defeminize motivation for pup retrieval. Further, it induces infanticide to a level higher than that of XX females but significantly lower than that of normal males (XY). Hence, we suggest that genes outside the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome and/or genes on autosomes are necessary for manifestation of full male-type parental behavior.((PMID:9527878))The sex-reversed mutation Sxr results in XX males. In the absence of any other mutations, testis differentiation in XXSxr fetuses is essentially normal and only one report of an XXSxr fetus with ovotestes is in the literature. We report that 84% (21/25) of 13 days postcoitum XXSxr fetuses on the B6 inbred genomic background have ovotestes. Ovotestes were found in fetuses from both Sxra and Sxrb variants. Examination of fetuses older than 13 dpc suggests that the presence of ovotestes is transient in most fetuses. However, one overt hermaphrodite was identified after birth. The development of ovotestes is associated with the inbred background and is exacerbated by the dominant spotting oncogene allele KitW-42J. We propose that spreading of X-inactivation into the Sxr region resulting in loss of Sry expression is more extensive in B6-Sxr strains.((PMID:7479793))We earlier described three lines of sex-reversed XY female mice deleted for sequences believed close to the testes-determining gene (Sry) on the Y chromosome short arm (Yp). The original sex-reversed females appeared among the offspring of XY males that carried the Yp duplication Sxr on their X chromosome. Earlier cytogenetic observations had suggested that the deletions resulted from asymmetrical meiotic recombination between the Y and the homologous Sxr region, but no direct evidence for this hypothesis was available. We have now analyzed the offspring of XSxr/Y males carrying an evolutionarily divergent Mus musculus domesticus Y chromosome, which permits detection and characterization of such recombination events. This analysis has enabled the derivation of a recombination map of Yp and Sxr, also demonstrating the orientation of Yp with respect to the Y centromere. The mapping data have established that Rbm, the murine homologue of a gene family cloned from the human Y chromosome, lies between Sry and the centromere. Analysis of two additional XY female lines shows that asymmetrical Yp-Sxr recombination leading to XY female sex reversal results in deletion of Rbm sequences. The deletions bring Sry closer to Y centromere, consistent with the hypothesis that position-effect inactivation of Sry is the basis for the sex reversal.((PMID:7587380))XYSxr (Sex reversal) mice carry a Y chromosome in which the chromatin (including Sry, the gene for testis determination) that normally resides on the short arm is duplicated and the second copy is relocated to the distal end of the long arm. Multicolor in situ hybridization to mitotic chromosomes of XYSxr males using probes for the telomere repeat sequence (TTAGGG)n and Sry shows that the rearranged chromatin is located distal to the telomeric signal. This suggests that the rearrangement arose from a recombination event involving the distal Y telomere sequences, i.e., within the telomere, a structure historically assumed to be incapable of participating in chromosome rearrangements.((PMID:1684224))The Sxr (sex-reversed) region, a fragment of the Y chromosome short arm, can cause chromosomally female XXSxr or XSxrO mice to develop as sterile males. The original Sxr region, termed Sxra, encodes: Tdy, the primary sex-determining gene; Hya, the controlling or structural locus for the minor transplantation antigen H-Y; gene(s) controlling the expression of the serologically detected male antigen (SDMA); Spy, a gene(s) required for the survival and proliferation of A spermatogonia during spermatogenesis; Zfy-1/Zfy-2, zinc-finger-containing genes of unknown function; and Sry, which is probably identical to Tdy. A deletion variant of Sxra, termed Sxrb, which lacks Hya, SDMA expression, Spy and some Zfy-2 sequences, makes positional cloning of these genes possible. We report here the isolation of a new testis-specific gene, Sby, mapping to the DNA deleted from the Sxrb region (the delta Sxrb interval). Sby has extensive homology to the X-linked human ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. The critical role of this enzyme in nuclear DNA replication together with the testis-specific expression of Sby suggests Sby as a candidate for the spermatogenic gene Spy.((PMID:25535777))Turner Syndrome (TS) is an unfavorable genetic condition with a prevalence of 1:2500 in newborn girls. Prompt and effective diagnosis is very important to appropriately monitor the comorbidities. The aim of the present study was to propose a feasible and practical molecular diagnostic tool for newborn screening by quantifying the gene dosage of the SHOX, VAMP7, XIST, UBA1, and SRY genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in individuals with a diagnosis of complete X monosomy, as well as those with TS variants, and then compare the results to controls without chromosomal abnormalities. According to our results, the most useful markers for these chromosomal variants were the genes found in the pseudoautosomic regions 1 and 2 (PAR1 and PAR2), because differences in gene dosage (relative quantification) between groups were more evident in SHOX and VAMP7 gene expression. Therefore, we conclude that these markers are useful for early detection in aneuploidies involving sex chromosomes.((PMID:18439975))The Y chromosome evolves from an autochromosome and accumulates male-related genes including sex-determining region of Y-chromosome (SRY) and several spermatogenesis-related genes. The human Y chromosome (60 Mb long) is largely composed of repetitive sequences that give it a heterochromatic appearance, and it consists of pseudoautosomal, euchromatic, and heterochromatic regions. Located on the two extremities of the Y chromosome, pseudoautosomal regions 1 and 2 (PAR1 and PAR2, 2.6 Mb and 320 bp long, respectively) are homologs with the termini of the X chromosome. The euchromatic region and some of the repeat-rich heterochromatic parts of the Y chromosome are called "male-specific Y" (MSY), which occupy more than 95% of the whole Y chromosome. After evolution, the Y chromosome becomes the smallest in size with the least number of genes but with the most number of copies of genes that are mostly spermatogenesis-related. The Y chromosome is characterized by highly repetitive sequences (including direct repeats, inverted repeats, and palindromes) and high polymorphism. Several gene rearrangements on the Y chromosome occur during evolution owing to its specific gene structure. The consequences of such rearrangements are not only loss but also gain of specific genes. One hundred and fifty three haplotypes have been discovered in the human Y chromosome. The structure of the Y chromosome in the GenBank belongs to haplotype R1. There are 220 genes (104 coding genes, 111 pseudogenes, and 5 other uncategorized genes) according to the most recent count. The 104 coding genes encode a total of about 48 proteins/protein families (including putative proteins/protein families). Among them, 16 gene products have been discovered in the azoospermia factor region (AZF) and are related to spermatogenesis. It has been discovered that one subset of gene rearrangements on the Y chromosome, "micro-deletions", is a major cause of male infertility in some populations. However, controversies exist about different Y chromosome haplotypes. Six AZFs of the Y chromosome have been discovered including AZFa, AZFb, AZFc, and their combinations AZFbc, AZFabc, and partial AZFc called AZFc/gr/gr. Different deletions in AZF lead to different content spermatogenesis loss from teratozoospermia to infertility in different populations depending on their Y haplotypes. This article describes the structure of the human Y chromosome and investigates the causes of micro-deletions and their relationship with male infertility from the view of chromosome evolution. After analysis of the relationship between AZFc and male infertility, we concluded that spermatogenesis is controlled by a network of genes, which may locate on the Y chromosome, the autochromosomes, or even on the X chromosome. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying male fertility/infertility will facilitate our knowledge of functional genomics.((PMID:23644099))Loss of Abcc6 gene expression was identified to be responsible for dystrophic calcification of the heart (DCC) or vessels after acute injury in several strains of laboratory mice. This calcification shares features with osteogenesis and may involve osteogenic factors. Tissue expression of osteopontin (Opn) and 11 osteogenic transcription factors were studied in vivo in mouse models for DCC and in vitro using luciferase reporter gene assays. Compared with DCC-resistant C57BL/6 mice, a significant increase in Opn transcription was demonstrated in necrotic lesions of both DCC-susceptible C3H/He and B6.C3H(Dyscalc1) congenic mice at day 3 after injury. Significant increases in gene expression were also demonstrated for the transcription factors runt domain-containing transcription factor 2 (Runx2), vitamin D receptor (Vdr), SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 protein, and Nfkb1 in C3H/He mice versus C57BL/6 controls. However, only Runx2 remained significantly increased in the B6.C3H(Dyscalc1) congenic mice, which carry only the Dyscalc1 locus with functional Abcc6 deletion on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Luciferase assay use increased Opn promoter activity, which was demonstrated after overexpression of Runx2. A poly-T stretch insertion was identified to stabilize the binding of Runx2, thus significantly enhancing Opn promoter activity. This Runx2-mediated activation was further enhanced by cotransfection with Vdr. Our data suggest a key role of Runx2 in the regulation of Opn in a model of cardiovascular calcification and demonstrate a synergistic cooperation of Runx2 and Vdr.((PMID:10730588))The hypothesis that the conservation of sex-chromosome-linked genes among placental mammals could be extended to the horse genome was tested using the UCDavis horse-mouse somatic cell hybrid (SCH) panel. By exploiting the fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique to localize an anchor locus, X-inactivation-specific transcript (XIST) on the horse X chromosome, together with the fragmentation and translocation of the X- and Y-chromosome fragments in a somatic cell hybrid panel, we regionally assigned 13 type I and 13 type II (microsatellite) markers to the horse X- and Y-chromosomes. The synteny groups that correspond to horse X- and Y-chromosomes were identified by synteny mapping of sex-specific loci zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX), zinc finger protein Y-linked (ZFY) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) on the SCH panel. A non-pseudoautosomal gene in the human steroid sulfatase (STS) was identified in both X- and Y-chromosome-containing clones. The regional order of the X-linked type I markers examined in this study, from Xp- to Xq-distal, was [STS-X, the voltage-gated chloride channel 4 (CLCN4)], [ZFX, delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2)], XIST, coagulation factor IX (F9) and [biglycan (BGN), equine F18, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)] (precise marker order could not be determined for genes within the same brackets). The order of the Y-linked type I markers was STS-Y, SRY and ZFY These orders are the same arrangements as reported for the human X- and Y-chromosomes, supporting the conservation of genomic organization between the human and the horse sex chromosomes. Regional ordering of X-linked type I and microsatellite markers provides the first integration of type I and type II markers in the horse X chromosome.((PMID:15142992))Estrogen (17beta-estradiol, E2)-deficient aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice develop Sertoli and Leydig cells at puberty. We hypothesized that estrogen, directly or indirectly, regulates genes responsible for somatic cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. ArKO ovaries expressed estrogen receptors alpha and beta, and LH receptor, indices of estrogen responsiveness in the ovary. Wild-type (Wt) and ArKO mice received either E2 or placebo for 3 wk, from 7-10 wk of age. E2 decreased serum FSH and LH and increased uterine weights of 10-wk-old ArKO mice. We measured mRNA expression of Sertoli cell, Sry-like HMG box protein 9 (Sox9); three upstream transcription factors, liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), steroidogenic factor 1, and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome gene 1; and one downstream factor, Müllerian-inhibiting substance. Placebo-treated ArKO ovaries have increased Sox9 (15-fold; P < 0.001), Müllerian-inhibiting substance (2.9-fold), Lrh-1 (7.7-fold), and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome gene 1 (12-fold) expression compared with Wt at 10 wk. Steroidogenic factor 1 was similar to Wt. Consistent with increased serum T levels and Leydig cells in their ovaries, placebo-treated ArKO ovaries had increased 17alpha-hydroxylase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-3, and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 expression compared with Wt at 10 wk. E2 treatment for 3 wk improved the ovarian phenotype, decreased development of Sertoli cells, decreased the expression of Sox9, Lrh-1, and the steroidogenic enzymes in ArKO ovaries, and induced ovulation in some cases. In conclusion, the expression of the genes regulating somatic cell differentiation is directly or indirectly responsive to estrogen.((PMID:27490115))We aimed to identify the genetic cause in a cohort of 11 unrelated cases and two sisters with 46,XX SRY-negative (ovo)testicular disorders of sex development (DSD).Whole-exome sequencing (n = 9), targeted resequencing (n = 4), and haplotyping were performed. Immunohistochemistry of sex-specific markers was performed on patients' gonads. The consequences of mutation were investigated using luciferase assays, localization studies, and RNA-seq.We identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 mutation, c.274C>T p.(Arg92Trp), in three unrelated patients. The Arg92 residue is highly conserved and located in the Ftz-F1 region, probably involved in DNA-binding specificity and stability. There were no consistent changes in transcriptional activation or subcellular localization. Transcriptomics in patient-derived lymphocytes showed upregulation of MAMLD1, a direct NR5A1 target previously associated with 46,XY DSD. In gonads of affected individuals, ovarian FOXL2 and testicular SRY-independent SOX9 expression observed.We propose NR5A1, previously associated with 46,XY DSD and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency, as a novel gene for 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. We hypothesize that p.(Arg92Trp) results in decreased inhibition of the male developmental pathway through downregulation of female antitestis genes, thereby tipping the balance toward testicular differentiation in 46,XX individuals. In conclusion, our study supports a role for NR5A1 in testis differentiation in the XX gonad.Genet Med advance online publication 04 August 2016Genetics in Medicine (2016); doi:10.1038/gim.2016.118.((PMID:15768398))ff1d is a novel zebrafish FTZ-F1 gene with sequence characteristics indicating similar basic regulatory mechanisms as the previously characterized ff1 based on the presence of an FTZ-F1 box in the DNA binding domain and an interactive domain (I-Box) and an AF-2 in the ligand binding domain. The highest sequence similarity was found between ff1d and ff1b (NR5A4), a gene previously shown to be a functional homolog to the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). The expression pattern of ff1d was comparable to ff1b both in brain and gonads in adults and in the pituitary and interrenal cells in embryos. SF-1 is crucial in mammalian steroidogenesis and in sex determination by regulating the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). In fish, AMH has not been described previously. In this study, we cloned a partial zebrafish AMH. AMH was detected in growing oocytes, the ovarian follicular layer and testicular Sertoli cells, similar to the mammalian pattern, suggesting a conserved role between zebrafish and mammalian AMH. Teleosts lack a gene homolog to SRY, which constitute the universal testis-determining factor in mammalian sex determination. Comparison of sequences and expression patterns indicate that ff1d is a new candidate for sex determination and differentiation in a way similar to SF-1, possibly involving AMH.((PMID:11301594))Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 vs. 15,000. Consequently, each invertebrate gene has been amplified to the maximum of four paralogous genes in vertebrates: the one-to-four rule. When this rule is applied to genes pertinent to gonadal development and differentiation, the following emerged: (i) Two closely related zinc-finger transcription factor genes in invertebrates have been amplified to two paralogous groups in vertebrates. One consisted of EGR1, EGR2, EGR3 and EGR4, whereas the only known paralogue of the other is WT1, which controls the developmental fate of the entire nephric system, and therefore of gonads. Interestingly, EGR1 and WT1 act as antagonists of each other in nephroblastic cells. (ii) SF-1, which controls the fate of two steroid hormone-producing organs, adrenals and gonads, is descended from the invertebrate Ftz-F1 gene, and its only known paralogue is GCNF-1. (iii) The Y-linked SRY, the mammalian testis-determining gene, is a paralogue neither of SOX3 (SRX) nor of SOX9. Its ancient origin suggests that SRY once became extinct in earlier vertebrates, only to revive itself in the mammalian ancestor. (iv) Inasmuch as four paralogues of one invertebrate nuclear receptor gene have differentiated to receptors of androgen, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and progesterone, there should at most be four paralogous estrogen-receptor genes in the vertebrate genome. It is likely that one of them plays a pivotal role in the estrogen-dependent sex-determining mechanism so commonly found among reptiles, amphibians and fish.((PMID:10412365))Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 versus 15,000.

Several genes required for this complex developmental process have now been identified. The genes LIM1, WT1 and FTZ-F1 have been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of the gonads prior to their differentiation as testes or ovaries. Subsequent sex-specific gonadal differentiation appears to be mediated by the SRY and SOX9 genes in the testis, and the DAX-1 gene in the ovary.((PMID:9722168))The sexual phenotype is established in three steps: (1) the sex chromosome constitution; (2) the differentiation of the gonads; and (3) the response of the internal and external genitalia to the hormones produced by the differentiated gonads. Errors that occur at any of these stages can result in defective sexual differentiation. Therefore the investigation of patients with abnormalities of testis development will help elucidate the mechanisms of sex determination and gonadal differentiation. It was in this way that SRY. the primary testis determining gene was identified. De novo mutations in SRY, result in gonadal dysgenesis by disrupting the DNA-binding activity of the SRY protein. However, only 20% of cases of gonadal dysgenesis, are explained by mutations in SRY or its flanking sequences. Therefore, there are several pieces to this puzzle yet to be discovered and it is hoped that mutation analysis of other genes implicated in gonadal development and differentiation may shed some light on aetiology of gonadal dysgenesis in the remaining 80% of cases.((PMID:9707471))Mammals have two genes (SRY and DMT1) for testis formation-androgenesis, an anti-testis gene, DAX1, an anti-Müllerian duct hormone, and steroid sex hormones. Drosophila uses the sex-lethal, transformer, and doublesex genes for sexual differentation and is supposed to lack sex hormones. However, the statement that insects do not have sex hormones loses much of its credibility if one considers (1) the classical endocrinological work on sexual differentiation in the firefly Lampyris and in the hevea tussock moth Orgyia; (2) the recent identification of an androgenic hormone and its role in sex determination in the isopod Armadillidium; (3) the similarity between steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) of mammals and fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) of Drosophila; and (4) the steroidogenic effect of gonadotropins secreted by the brain of female locusts and mosquitoes and of male gypsy moth. In our model, based on data from the literature, ecdysone, when present in high concentrations, might function as an androgenic sex steroid. It is also the precursor of 20-OH-ecdysone, which is the moulting hormone of insects, and in vitellogenic females of many species, the counterpart of estrogens as well. Other gender-specific hormones are likely to exist in the brain-gonad axis.((PMID:8840189))In mammals, the presence of SRY, the sex-determining gene located on the Y chromosome is required to induce the gonadal anlage to differentiate as a testis, whereas its absence leads to the development of an ovary. We report here the characterization by 5' and 3' RACE analysis of several SRY transcripts which are expressed in the ovine male developing gonads. These transcripts were not detected in any other fetal tissues and were expressed only in the genital portion of the urogenital ridge. The temporal profile of SRY expression analyzed by RT-PCR suggests that in the sheep fetus the role of SRY is not limited to initiating Sertoli cell differentiation as in mice. Indeed, SRY transcripts persist after the full differentiation of the testis. In addition to SRY, other genes are known to be involved in mammalian sex determination: Wilms' tumor gene WT-1, steroidogenic factor gene Ftz-F1 (SF-1) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). We investigated the expression patterns of these genes by RT-PCR during fetal development in sheep gonads. Concerning WT-1 and SF-1, our results are consistent with those described in mice where the earliest expression was detected before the sexual differentiation in both sexes. In male, the ontogenesis of AMH transcription corresponds to the seminiferous cords formation (30 dpc). In female, we have observed the presence of SF-1 transcripts from the undifferentiated stage until birth. In addition, P450 aromatase expression is detected from 30 dpc and is correlated with the presence of 17-beta estradiol in sheep ovary. These data reveal significant differences between rodent and ruminant models concerning the sex-determining pathway.((PMID:8645557))During embryogenesis, most organ rudiments differentiate into only one type of organ and functional mutations are normally lethal for the embryo. However, the indifferent gonad has two options, to form either a testis or an ovary, and mutations of this tissue usually produce sex reversal or sterility which is not lethal for the individual. Therefore, gonadal development serves as an excellent model system for investigating questions of cell fate and organogenesis. The studies of human patients showing different types of sex reversal, in combination with the use of transgenic mice and/or gene targeting disruption, have led to the isolation of several genes important for sex development. These include SRY/Sry, encoding the testis-determining factor, Ftz-F1 encoding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and Wilms' tumor gene (WT-1). However, the mammalian sex differentiation pathway requires the function of a number of additional genes which we are now trying to identify with the help of mRNA differential display technique.((PMID:11145965))Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is an orphan nuclear receptor that activates the alpha(1)-fetoprotein gene during early liver developmental growth. Here we sought to define better the position of FTF in transcriptional cascades leading to hepatic differentiation. The mouse FTF gene was isolated and assigned to chromosome 1 band E4 (one mFTF pseudogene was also found). Exon/intron mapping shows an mFTF gene structure similar to that of its close homologue SF1, with two more N-terminal exons in the mFTF gene; exon mapping also delimits several FTF mRNA 5'- and 3'-splice variants. The mFTF transcription initiation site was located in adult liver at 238 nucleotides from the first translation initiator codon, with six canonical GATA, E box, and Nkx motifs clustered between -50/-140 base pairs (bp) from the cap site; DNA/protein binding assays also pinpointed an HNF4-binding element at +36 bp and an FTF-binding element at -257 bp. Transfection assays and point mutations showed that the mFTF promoter is activated by GATA, HNF4alpha, FTF, Nkx, and basic helix-loop-helix factors, with marked cooperativity between GATA and HNF4alpha. A tandem GATA/E box activatory motif in the proximal mFTF promoter is strikingly similar to a composite motif coactivated by differentiation inducers in the hematopoietic lineage; a tandem GATA-Nkx motif in the distal mFTF promoter is also similar to a composite motif transducing differentiation signals from transforming growth factor-beta-like receptors in the cardiogenic lineage. Three genes encoding transcription factors critical to early hepatic differentiation, Hnf3beta, Hnf4alpha, and Hnf1alpha, each contain dual FTF-binding elements in their proximal promoters, and all three promoters are activated by FTF in transfection assays. Direct DNA binding action and cooperativity was demonstrated between FTF and HNF3beta on the Hnf3beta promoter and between FTF and HNF4alpha on the Hnf1alpha promoter. These combined results suggest that FTF is an early intermediary between endodermal specification signals and downstream genes that establish and amplify the hepatic phenotype.((PMID:27639079))Biliary-committed progenitor cells (small cholangiocytes, SMCCs) from small bile ducts are more resistant to hepatobiliary injury than large mouse cholangiocytes (LGCCs) from large bile ducts. The definitive endoderm marker, FoxA2 is the key transcriptional factor that regulates cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Our aim was to characterize the translational role of FoxA2 during cholestatic liver injury.mRNA expression in SMCCs and LGCCs was assessed by PCR array analysis. Liver tissues and hepatic stellate cells from PSC and PBC patients were tested by real-time PCR for methylation, senescence and fibrosis markers. Bile duct ligation (BDL) and MDR2 knockout mice (MDR2(-/-) ) were used as animal models of cholestatic liver injury with or without healthy transplanted large or small cholangiocytes.We demonstrated that FoxA2 was notably enhanced in murine liver progenitor cells and SMCCs, and was silenced in human PSC and PBC liver tissues relative to respective controls that are correlated with the epigenetic methylation enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Serum ALT and AST levels in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with SMCCs after BDL showed significant changes compared with vehicle-treated mice, along with improved liver fibrosis. Enhanced expression of FoxA2 was observed in BDL mouse liver after SMCC cell therapy. Furthermore, activation of fibrosis signaling pathways were observed in BDL/MDR2(-/-) mouse liver as well as in isolated hepatic stellate cells by laser capture microdissection, and these signals were recovered along with reduced hepatic senescence and enhanced hepatic stellate cellular senescence after SMCC engraft.The definitive endoderm marker and the positive regulator of biliary development, FoxA2, mediates the therapeutic effect of biliary-committed progenitor cells during cholestatic liver injury.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified a modest frequency of FOXA2 mutations in endometrioid endometrial cancers (EEC). The current study sought to determine the relationship between FOXA2 mutation and clinicopathologic features in EEC and FOXA2 expression.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing were used to identify mutations in 542 EEC. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess expression. Methylation analysis was performed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and sequencing. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Student's t- and log-rank tests were performed.Fifty-one mutations were identified in 49 tumors (9.4% mutation rate). The majority of mutations were novel, loss of function (LOF) (78.4%) mutations, and most disrupted the DNA-binding domain (58.8%). Six recurrent mutations were identified. Only two tumors had two mutations and there was no evidence for FOXA2 allelic loss. Mutation status was associated with tumor grade and not associated with survival outcomes. Methylation of the FOXA2 promoter region was highly variable. Most tumors expressed FOXA2 at both the mRNA and protein level. In those tumors with mutations, the majority of cases expressed both alleles.FOXA2 is frequently mutated in EEC. The pattern of FOXA2 mutations and expression in tumors suggests complex regulation and a haploinsufficient or dominant-negative tumor suppressor function. In vitro studies may shed light on how mutations in FOXA2 affect FOXA2 pioneer and/or transcription factor functions in EEC.((PMID:27404023))Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is a key component of high density lipoproteins which possess anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Insulin is a crucial mediator of the glucose and lipid metabolism that has been implicated in atherosclerotic and inflammatory processes. Important mediators of insulin signaling such as Liver X Receptors (LXRs) and Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) are known to regulate apoA-I expression in liver. Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a well-known target of insulin signaling and a key mediator of oxidative stress response. Low doses of insulin were shown to activate apoA-I expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. However, the detailed mechanisms for these processes are still unknown. We studied the possible involvement of FOXO1, FOXA2, LXRα, and LXRβ transcription factors in the insulin-mediated regulation of apoA-I expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with high doses of insulin (48 h, 100 nM) suppresses apoA-I gene expression. siRNAs against FOXO1, FOXA2, LXRβ, or LXRα abrogated this effect. FOXO1 forms a complex with LXRβ and insulin treatment impairs FOXO1/LXRβ complex binding to hepatic enhancer and triggers its nuclear export. Insulin as well as LXR ligand TO901317 enhance the interaction between FOXA2, LXRα, and hepatic enhancer. These data suggest that high doses of insulin downregulate apoA-I gene expression in HepG2 cells through redistribution of FOXO1/LXRβ complex, FOXA2, and LXRα on hepatic enhancer of apoA-I gene. J.

Whole genome analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that temporal cortical gene expression differs between TLE patients with high vs. low baseline seizure frequency.Baseline seizure frequency was used as a clinical measure of epileptogenicity. Twenty-four patients in high or low seizure frequency groups (median seizures/month) underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy for intractable TLE. RNA was isolated from the lateral temporal cortex and submitted for expression analysis. Genes significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency on likelihood ratio test were identified based on >0.90 area under the ROC curve, P value of <0.05.Expression levels of forty genes were significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency. Of the seven most significant, four have been linked to other neurologic diseases. Expression levels associated with high seizure frequency included low expression of Homeobox A10, Forkhead box A2, Lymphoblastic leukemia derived sequence 1, HGF activator, Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain containing 11, Thanatos-associated protein domain containing 8 and Heparin sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 3A1.This study describes novel associations between forty known genes and a clinical marker of epileptogenicity, baseline seizure frequency. Four of the seven discussed have been previously related to other neurologic diseases. Future investigation of these genes could establish new biomarkers for predicting epileptogenicity, and could have significant implications for diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as epilepsy pathogenesis.((PMID:27322206))Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Better understanding of pancreatic cancer biology may help identify new oncotargets towards more effective therapies. This study investigated the mechanistic actions of microRNA-1291 (miR-1291) in the suppression of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our data showed that miR-1291 was downregulated in a set of clinical pancreatic carcinoma specimens and human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Restoration of miR-1291 expression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-1291 sharply suppressed the tumorigenicity of PANC-1 cells in mouse models. A proteomic profiling study revealed 32 proteins altered over 2-fold in miR-1291-expressing PANC-1 cells that could be assembled into multiple critical pathways for cancer. Among them anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) was reduced to the greatest degree. Through computational and experimental studies we further identified that forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), a transcription factor governing AGR2 expression, was a direct target of miR-1291. These results connect miR-1291 to the FOXA2-AGR2 regulatory pathway in the suppression of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, providing new insight into the development of miRNA-based therapy to combat pancreatic cancer.((PMID:27153842))Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols (TG) within lysosomes to mobilise NEFA and cholesterol. Since LAL-deficient (Lal (-/-) ) mice suffer from progressive loss of adipose tissue and severe accumulation of lipids in hepatic lysosomes, we hypothesised that LAL deficiency triggers alternative energy pathway(s).We studied metabolic adaptations in Lal (-/-) mice.Despite loss of adipose tissue, Lal (-/-) mice show enhanced glucose clearance during insulin and glucose tolerance tests and have increased uptake of [(3)H]2-deoxy-D-glucose into skeletal muscle compared with wild-type mice. In agreement, fasted Lal (-/-) mice exhibit reduced glucose and glycogen levels in skeletal muscle. We observed 84% decreased plasma leptin levels and significantly reduced hepatic ATP, glucose, glycogen and glutamine concentrations in fed Lal (-/-) mice. Markedly reduced hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations decrease the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) target genes. However, treatment of Lal (-/-) mice with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate further decreased plasma TG (and hepatic glucose and glycogen) concentrations in Lal (-/-) mice. Depletion of hepatic nuclear factor 4α and forkhead box protein a2 in fasted Lal (-/-) mice might be responsible for reduced expression of microsomal TG transfer protein, defective VLDL synthesis and drastically reduced plasma TG levels.Our findings indicate that neither activation nor inactivation of PPARα per se but rather the availability of hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations regulates VLDL synthesis and subsequent metabolic adaptations in Lal (-/-) mice. We conclude that decreased plasma VLDL production enhances glucose uptake into skeletal muscle to compensate for the lack of energy supply.((PMID:27121852))Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have discovered a number of loci that contribute to susceptibility to the disease. Future challenges include elucidation of functional mechanisms through which these GWAS-identified loci modulate T2D disease risk. The aim of the present study was to comprehensively characterize T2D associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes through computational approaches.Computational biology approaches used in the present study included comparative genomic analyses and functional annotation using GWAS3D and RegulomeDB, investigation of the effects of T2D-associated SNPs on miRNA binding and protein phosphorylation, and gene ontology, pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional module analysis of T2D-associated genes from previously published GWAS.Computational analysis identified a number of T2D GWAS-associated SNPs that were located at protein binding sites, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4A), transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2), forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and A2 (FOXA2), and potentially affected the binding of miRNAs and protein phosphorylation. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed two well-known maturity onset diabetes of the young and T2D pathways, whereas PPI network analysis identified highly interconnected "hub" genes, such as TCF7L2, melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B), and solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 (SLC30A8), that created two tight subnetworks.The results provide objectives and clues for future experimental studies and further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T2D.((PMID:26855178))Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 transcription factors (HNF1α/β) are associated with diabetes. These factors are well studied in the liver, pancreas and kidney, where they direct tissue-specific gene regulation. However, they also have an important role in the biology of many other tissues, including the intestine. We investigated the transcriptional network governed by HNF1 in an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco2). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify HNF1 binding sites genome-wide. Direct targets of HNF1 were validated using conventional ChIP assays and confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1, followed by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology process enrichment analysis of the HNF1 targets identified multiple processes with a role in intestinal epithelial cell function, including properties of the cell membrane, cellular response to hormones, and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Approximately 50% of HNF1 binding sites were also occupied by other members of the intestinal transcriptional network, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). Depletion of HNF1 in Caco2 cells increases FOXA2 abundance and decreases levels of CDX2, illustrating the coordinated activities of the network. These data suggest that HNF1 plays an important role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function, both directly and through interactions with other intestinal transcription factors.((PMID:26713283))The transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β or transcription factor 3β), has been found to play pivotal roles in multiple phases of mammalian life, from the early development to the organofaction, and subsequently in homeostasis and metabolism in the adult. In the embryonic development period, FOXA2 is require d for the formation of the primitive node and notochord, and its absence results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, FOXA2 plays an important role not only in lung development, but also in T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia. In this article, the role of FOXA2 in lung development and Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation, as well as in goblet cell hyperplasia, is reviewed. FOXA2 deletion in airway epithelium results into Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in developing lung. Leukotriene pathway and signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 pathway may mediate this inflammation through recruitment and activation of denditric cell during lung developments. FOXA2 is a potential treatment target for lung diseases with Th2 inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.((PMID:26644349))Group IVA phospholipase A2 [cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α)] is a key mediator of inflammation and tumorigenesis. In this study, by using a combination of chemical inhibition and genetic approaches in zebrafish and murine cells, we identify a mechanism by which cPLA2α promotes cell proliferation. We identified 2 cpla2α genes in zebrafish, cpla2αa and cpla2αb, with conserved phospholipase activity. In zebrafish, loss of cpla2α expression or inhibition of cpla2α activity diminished G1 progression through the cell cycle. This phenotype was also seen in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mesangial cells. G1 progression was rescued by the addition of arachidonic acid or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indicating a phospholipase-dependent mechanism. We further show that PGE2, through PI3K/AKT activation, promoted Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) phosphorylation and FOXO1 nuclear export. This led to up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p27(Kip1), thus promoting G1 progression. Finally, using pharmacologic inhibitors, we show that cPLA2α, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways cooperatively regulate G1 progression in response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation. In summary, these data indicate that cPLA2α, through its phospholipase activity, is a critical effector of G1 phase progression through the cell cycle and suggest that pharmacological targeting of this enzyme may have important therapeutic benefits in disease mechanisms that involve excessive cell proliferation, in particular, cancer and proliferative glomerulopathies.((PMID:26574435))Growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation is crucial in liver regeneration and the recovery of liver function after injury. The nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), is a key transcription factor for the xenobiotic-induced expression of genes associated with various liver functions. Recently, we reported that PXR activation stimulates xenobiotic-induced hepatocyte proliferation. In the present study, we investigated whether PXR activation also stimulates growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation. In G0 phase-synchronized, immortalized mouse hepatocytes, serum or epidermal growth factor treatment increased cell growth and this growth was augmented by the expression of mouse PXR and co-treatment with pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a PXR ligand. In a liver regeneration model using carbon tetrachloride, PCN treatment enhanced the injury-induced increase in the number of Ki-67-positive nuclei as well as Ccna2 and Ccnb1 mRNA levels in wild-type (WT) but not Pxr-null mice. Chronological analysis of this model demonstrated that PCN treatment shifted the maximum cell proliferation to an earlier time point and increased the number of M-phase cells at those time points. In WT but not Pxr-null mice, PCN treatment reduced hepatic mRNA levels of genes involved in the suppression of G0/G1- and G1/S-phase transition, e.g. Rbl2, Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b. Analysis of the Rbl2 promoter revealed that PXR activation inhibited its Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)-mediated transcription. Finally, the PXR-mediated enhancement of hepatocyte proliferation was inhibited by the expression of dominant active FOXO3 in vitro. The results of the present study suggest that PXR activation stimulates growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation in mice, at least in part, through inhibiting FOXO3 from accelerating cell-cycle progression.((PMID:26564177))'Glucotoxicity' is a term used to convey the negative effect of hyperglycaemia on beta cell function; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that impair insulin secretion and gene expression are poorly defined. Our objective was to define the role of transcription factor v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue 1 (Ets-1) in beta cell glucotoxicity.Primary islets and Min6 cells were exposed to high glucose and Ets-1 expression was measured. Recombinant adenovirus and transgenic mice were used to upregulate Ets-1 expression in beta cells in vitro and in vivo, and insulin secretion was assessed. The binding activity of H3/H4 histone on the Ets-1 promoter, and that of forkhead box (FOX)A2, FOXO1 and Ets-1 on the Pdx-1 promoter was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR assay.High glucose induced upregulation of Ets-1 expression and hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4 at the Ets-1 gene promoter in beta cells. Ets-1 overexpression dramatically suppressed insulin secretion and biosynthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, Ets-1 overexpression increased the activity of FOXO1 but decreased that of FOXA2 binding to the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) homology region 2 (PH2), resulting in inhibition of Pdx-1 promoter activity and downregulation of PDX-1 expression and activity. In addition, high glucose promoted the interaction of Ets-1 and FOXO1, and the activity of Ets-1 binding to the Pdx-1 promoter. Importantly, PDX-1 overexpression reversed the defect in pancreatic beta cells induced by Ets-1 excess, while knockdown of Ets-1 prevented hyperglycaemia-induced dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells.Our observations suggest that Ets-1 links glucotoxicity to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction through inhibiting PDX-1 expression in type 2 diabetes.((PMID:26517695))Cellular metabolism is increasingly recognized as a controller of immune cell fate and function. MicroRNA-33 (miR-33) regulates cellular lipid metabolism and represses genes involved in cholesterol efflux, HDL biogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. Here, we determined that miR-33-mediated disruption of the balance of aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation instructs macrophage inflammatory polarization and shapes innate and adaptive immune responses. Macrophage-specific Mir33 deletion increased oxidative respiration, enhanced spare respiratory capacity, and induced an M2 macrophage polarization-associated gene profile. Furthermore, miR-33-mediated M2 polarization required miR-33 targeting of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not cholesterol efflux. Notably, miR-33 inhibition increased macrophage expression of the retinoic acid-producing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2 (ALDH1A2) and retinal dehydrogenase activity both in vitro and in a mouse model. Consistent with the ability of retinoic acid to foster inducible Tregs, miR-33-depleted macrophages had an enhanced capacity to induce forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression in naive CD4(+) T cells. Finally, treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with miR-33 inhibitors for 8 weeks resulted in accumulation of inflammation-suppressing M2 macrophages and FOXP3(+) Tregs in plaques and reduced atherosclerosis progression. Collectively, these results reveal that miR-33 regulates macrophage inflammation and demonstrate that miR-33 antagonism is atheroprotective, in part, by reducing plaque inflammation by promoting M2 macrophage polarization and Treg induction.((PMID:26507166))Mucus hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia are common features that characterize asthma. IL-13 increases mucin (MUC) 5AC, the major component of airway mucus, in airway epithelial cells. According to the literature, IL-13 receptor activation leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1) gene expression, associated with the induction of MUC5AC. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of heme to biliverdin, and has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. We examined the effects of HO-1 on mucin production and goblet cell hyperplasia induced by IL-13. Moreover, we assessed the cell signaling intermediates that appear to be responsible for mucin production. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were grown at air liquid interface (ALI) in the presence or absence of IL-13 and hemin, a HO-1 inducer, for 14 days. Protein concentration was analyzed using ELISA, and mRNA expression was examined by real-time PCR. Histochemical analysis was performed using HE staining, andWestern blotting was performed to evaluate signaling transduction pathway. Hemin (4 μM) significantly increased HO-1 protein expression (p b 0.01) and HO-1 mRNA expression (p b 0.001). IL-13 significantly increased goblet cells, MUC5AC protein secretion (p b 0.01) and MUC5AC mRNA (p b 0.001), and these were decreased by hemin by way of HO-1. Tin protoporphyrin (SnPP)-IX, a HO-1 inhibitor, blocked the effect of hemin restoring MUC5AC protein secretion (p b 0.05) and goblet cell hyperplasia. Hemin decreased the expression of CLCA1 mRNA (p b 0.05) and it was reversed by SnPP-IX, but could not suppress IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT6 or SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) and Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) mRNA expression. In summary, HO-1 overexpression suppressed IL-13-induced goblet cell hyperplasia and MUC5AC production, and involvement of CLCA1 in the mechanism was suggested.((PMID:26494966))To show the efficient generation of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) differentiated from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of rats.Hepatic differentiation was achieved using a three-step protocol with several growth factors. First, rat iPSCs were differentiated into definitive endoderm cells using Activin A and Wnt3a treatment. Then fibroblast growth factor 4 and bone morphogenetic protein 2 were added to the culture medium and used to induce hepatic differentiation. Finally, hepatocyte growth factor, Oncostatin M and dexamethasone were used for hepatic maturation. The liver-related markers and functions of HLCs were assessed at the gene and protein levels.After endodermal induction, the differentiated cells expressed endodermal markers forkhead box protein A2 and SRY-box containing gene 17 at the mRNA and protein levels. After 20 d of culture, the iPSCs were differentiated into HLCs. These differentiated cells expressed hepatic markers including α-fetoprotein, albumin CK8, CK18, CK19, and transcription factor HNF-4α. In addition, the cells expressed functional proteins such as α1-antitrypsin, cytochrome P450 1A2 and CYP 3A4. They acted like healthy hepatic cells, storing glycogen and taking up indocyanine green and low-density lipoproteins. Also, the rates of urea synthesis (20 d 1.202 ± 0.080 mg/dL vs 0 d 0.317 ± 0.021 mg/dL, P < 0.01) and albumin secretion (20 d 1.601 ± 0.102 mg/dL vs 0 d 0.313 ± 0.015 mg/dL, P < 0.01) increased significantly as differentiation progressed.Rat iPSCs can differentiate into HLCs rapidly and efficiently. These differentiated cells may be an attractive resource for treatment of end-stage liver disease.((PMID:26423870))Hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (such as human embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) are expected to be utilized in drug screening. However, the hepatocyte differentiation efficiency and hepatic functions of hepatocyte-like cells were not sufficient to perform ES/iPS cell-based drug discovery. Therefore, we decided to improve the method of hepatocyte differentiation from human ES/iPS cells. To enhance this hepatocyte differentiation efficiency, hepatocyte-related transcription factors, such as forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α), were overexpressed during the hepatocyte differentiation process. In addition, to enhance the functions of hepatocyte-like cells, these cells were cultured in three dimensional (3D) conditions using a Nanopillar plate. By FOXA2 and HNF1α overexpression, human ES/iPS cells could efficiently (more than 80%) differentiate into albumin-positive hepatocyte-like cells. Various hepatic functions, including albumin secretion and drug metabolism capacities, of the hepatocyte-like cells were significantly enhanced by performing 3D cell culture. These results suggest that the method of hepatocyte differentiation could be improved by using gene transfer and 3D cell culture technologies. We believe that these new hepatocyte-like cells would be useful tools in drug development.((PMID:26157580))The enterohormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is required to amplify glucose-induced insulin secretion that facilitates peripheral glucose utilisation. Alteration in GLP-1 secretion during obesity has been reported but is still controversial. Due to the high adaptability of intestinal cells to environmental changes, we hypothesised that the density of GLP-1-producing cells could be modified by nutritional factors to prevent the deterioration of metabolic condition in obesity. We quantified L-cell density in jejunum samples collected during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in forty-nine severely obese subjects analysed according to their fat consumption. In mice, we deciphered the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet (HFD) makes an impact on enteroendocrine cell density and function. L-cell density in the jejunum was higher in obese subjects consuming >30 % fat compared with low fat eaters. Mice fed a HFD for 8 weeks displayed an increase in GLP-1-positive cells in the jejunum and colon accordingly to GLP-1 secretion. The regulation by the HFD appears specific to GLP-1-producing cells, as the number of PYY (peptide YY)-positive cells remained unchanged. Moreover, genetically obese ob/ob mice did not show alteration of GLP-1-positive cell density in the jejunum or colon, suggesting that obesity per se is not sufficient to trigger the mechanism. The higher L-cell density in HFD-fed mice involved a rise in L-cell terminal differentiation as witnessed by the increased expression of transcription factors downstream of neurogenin3 (Ngn3). We suggest that the observed increase in GLP-1-positive cell density triggered by high fat consumption in humans and mice might favour insulin secretion and therefore constitute an adaptive response of the intestine to balance diet-induced insulin resistance.((PMID:26138366))Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood. Here we studied 60 RMSs using whole-exome/-transcriptome sequencing, copy number (CN) and DNA methylome analyses to unravel the genetic/epigenetic basis of RMS. On the basis of methylation patterns, RMS is clustered into four distinct subtypes, which exhibits remarkable correlation with mutation/CN profiles, histological phenotypes and clinical behaviours. A1 and A2 subtypes, especially A1, largely correspond to alveolar histology with frequent PAX3/7 fusions and alterations in cell cycle regulators. In contrast, mostly showing embryonal histology, both E1 and E2 subtypes are characterized by high frequency of CN alterations and/or allelic imbalances, FGFR4/RAS/AKT pathway mutations and PTEN mutations/methylation and in E2, also by p53 inactivation. Despite the better prognosis of embryonal RMS, patients in the E2 are likely to have a poor prognosis. Our results highlight the close relationships of the methylation status and gene mutations with the biological behaviour in RMS.((PMID:25995156))It has been shown that acetylcholine is both a neurotransmitter and acts as a local mediator, produced by airway cells including epithelial cells. In vivo studies have demonstrated an indirect role for acetylcholine in epithelial cell differentiation. Here, we aimed to investigate direct effects of endogenous non-neuronal acetylcholine on epithelial cell differentiation.Human airway epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI). Cells were exposed to the muscarinic antagonist tiotropium (10 nM), interleukin (IL)-13 (1, 2 and 5 ng/mL), or a combination of IL-13 and tiotropium, during or after differentiation at the ALI.Human airway epithelial cells expressed all components of the non-neuronal cholinergic system, suggesting acetylcholine production. Tiotropium had no effects on epithelial cell differentiation after air exposure. Differentiation into goblet cells was barely induced after air exposure. Therefore, IL-13 (1 ng/mL) was used to induce goblet cell metaplasia. IL-13 induced MUC5AC-positive cells (5-fold) and goblet cells (14-fold), as assessed by histochemistry, and MUC5AC gene expression (105-fold). These effects were partly prevented by tiotropium (47-92%). Goblet cell metaplasia was induced by IL-13 in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by tiotropium. In addition, tiotropium reversed goblet cell metaplasia induced by 2 weeks of IL-13 exposure. IL-13 decreased forkhead box protein A2 (FoxA2) expression (1.6-fold) and increased FoxA3 (3.6-fold) and SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) (5.2-fold) expression. Tiotropium prevented the effects on FoxA2 and FoxA3, but not on SPDEF.We demonstrate that tiotropium has no effects on epithelial cell differentiation after air exposure, but inhibits and reverses IL-13-induced goblet cell metaplasia, possibly via FoxA2 and FoxA3. This indicates that non-neuronal acetylcholine contributes to goblet cell differentiation by a direct effect on epithelial cells.((PMID:25921584))The forkhead box A (FOXA) family of pioneer transcription factors is critical for the development of many endoderm-derived tissues. Their importance in regulating biological processes in the lung and liver is extensively characterized, though much less is known about their role in intestine. Here we investigate the contribution of FOXA2 to coordinating intestinal epithelial cell function using postconfluent Caco2 cells, differentiated into an enterocyte-like model. FOXA2 binding sites genome-wide were determined by ChIP-seq and direct targets of the factor were validated by ChIP-qPCR and siRNA-mediated depletion of FOXA1/2 followed by RT-qPCR. Peaks of FOXA2 occupancy were frequent at loci contributing to gene ontology pathways of regulation of cell migration, cell motion, and plasma membrane function. Depletion of both FOXA1 and FOXA2 led to a significant reduction in the expression of multiple transmembrane proteins including ion channels and transporters, which form a network that is essential for maintaining normal ion and solute transport. One of the targets was the adenosine A2B receptor, and reduced receptor mRNA levels were associated with a functional decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP. We also observed that 30% of FOXA2 binding sites contained a GATA motif and that FOXA1/A2 depletion reduced GATA-4, but not GATA-6 protein levels. These data show that FOXA2 plays a pivotal role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function. Moreover, that the FOXA and GATA families of transcription factors may work cooperatively to regulate gene expression genome-wide in the intestinal epithelium.((PMID:27653037))G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. G6PC2 forms a substrate cycle with glucokinase that determines the glucose sensitivity of insulin secretion. Consequently, deletion of G6pc2 lowers fasting blood glucose (FBG) without affecting fasting plasma insulin. While chronic elevation of FBG is detrimental to health, glucocorticoids induce G6PC2 expression suggesting that G6PC2 evolved to transiently modulate FBG under conditions of glucocorticoid-related stress. We show using competition and mutagenesis experiments, that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) induces G6PC2 promoter activity through a mechanism involving displacement of the islet-enriched transcription factor MafA by the glucocorticoid receptor. The induction of G6PC2 promoter activity by Dex is modulated by a single nucleotide polymorphism, previously linked to altered FBG in humans, that affects FOXA2 binding. A 5 day repeated injection paradigm was used to examine the chronic effect of Dex on FBG and glucose tolerance in WT and G6pc2 KO mice. Acute Dex treatment only induces G6pc2 expression in 129SvEv but not C57BL/6J mice but this chronic treatment induced G6pc2 expression in both. In 6 hr fasted C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice, Dex treatment lowered FBG and improved glucose tolerance, with G6pc2 deletion exacerbating the decrease in FBG and enhancing the improvement in glucose tolerance. In contrast, in 24 hr fasted C57BL/6J WT mice, Dex treatment raised FBG but still improved glucose tolerance, with G6pc2 deletion limiting the increase in FBG and enhancing the improvement in glucose tolerance. These observations demonstrate that G6pc2 modulates the complex effects of Dex on both FBG and glucose tolerance.((PMID:27599506))We show characteristic morphological changes corresponding to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program fulfillment in PANC1 cell line stimulated with TGFβ1. Our results support downregulation of E-cadherin protein. We show 5- and 28-fold increase in SNAI1 and SNAI2 expression levels and 25- and 15-fold decrease in CDH1 and KRT8 expression levels, respectively, which confirms the EMT-program fulfillment. We demonstrate downregulation of expression of pancreatic master genes SOX9, FOXA2, and GATA4 (2-, 5-, and 4-fold, respectively) and absence of significant changes in HES1, NR5A2, and GATA6 expression levels in the cells stimulated with TGFβ1. Our results indicate the absence of induction of expression of PTF1A, PDX1, HNF1b, NEUROG3, RPBJL, NKX6.1, and ONECUT1 genes, which are inactive in PANC1 cell line after the EMT stimulated by TGFβ1.((PMID:27586588))Barrett's oesophagus (BO), an intestinal-type metaplasia (IM), typically arising in conjunction with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, is a prominent risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). The molecular similarities between IM and normal intestinal tissues are ill-defined. Consequently, the contribution of intestine-enriched factors expressed within BO to oncogenesis is unclear. Herein, using transcriptomics we define the intestine-enriched genes expressed in meta-profiles of BO and OAC. Interestingly, 77% of the genes differentially expressed in a meta-profile of BO were similarly expressed in intestinal tissues. Furthermore, 85% of this intestine-like signature was maintained upon transition to OAC. Gene networking analysis of transcription factors within this signature revealed a network centred upon NR5A2, GATA6 and FOXA2, whose over-expression was determined in a cohort of BO and OAC patients. Simulated acid reflux was observed to induce the expression of both NR5A2 and GATA6. Using siRNA-mediated silencing and an NR5A2 antagonist we demonstrate that NR5A2-mediated cancer cell survival is facilitated through augmentation of GATA6 and anti-apoptotic factor BCL-XL levels. Abrogation of NR5A2-GATA6 expression in conjunction with BCL-XL co-silencing resulted in synergistically increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and photo-dynamic therapeutics. These findings characterize the intestine-like signature associated with IM which may have important consequences to adenocarcinogenesis.((PMID:27578787))Cell fate specification depends on transcriptional activation driven by lineage-specific transcription factors as well as changes in chromatin organization. To date, the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin modifiers during development is not well understood. We focus here on the initiation of the pancreatic program from multipotent endodermal progenitors. Transcription factors that play key roles in regulating pancreatic progenitor state have been identified, but the chromatin regulators that help establishing and maintaining pancreatic fate are less well known. Using a comparative approach, we identify a critical role for the histone methyltransferase Setd7 in establishing pancreatic cell identity. We show that Setd7 is expressed in the prospective pancreatic endoderm of Xenopus and mouse embryos prior to Pdx1 induction. Importantly, we demonstrate that setd7 is sufficient and required for pancreatic cell fate specification in Xenopus Functional and biochemical approaches in Xenopus and mouse endoderm support that Setd7 modulates methylation marks at pancreatic regulatory regions, possibly through interaction with the transcription factor Foxa2. Together, these results demonstrate that Setd7 acts as a central component of the transcription complex initiating the pancreatic program.((PMID:27576578))Recently, the US FDA has approved "vagal blocking therapy or vBLoc® therapy" as a new treatment for obesity. The aim of the present study was to study the mechanism-of-action of "VBLOC" in rat models.Rats were implanted with VBLOC, an intra-abdominal electrical device with leads placed around gastric vagal trunks through an abdominal incision and controlled by wireless device. Body weight, food intake, hunger/satiety, and metabolic parameters were monitored by a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Brain-gut responses were analyzed physiologically.VBLOC reduced body weight and food intake, which was associated with increased satiety but not with decreased hunger. Brain activities in response to VBLOC included increased gene expression of leptin and CCKb receptors, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor, and transforming growth factor β1 in the brainstem; increased CCK, somatostatin, and tyrosine hydroxylase in the hippocampus; increased NPY, AgRP, and Foxa2 in the hypothalamus; and reduced CCKb receptor, melanocortin 4 receptor, and insulin receptor in the hypothalamus. Plasma concentrations of CCK, gastrin, glucagon, GLP-1, and PYY and gastric acid secretion were unchanged in response to VBLOC.Based on the present study, we may suggest that VBLOC induces satiety through vagal signaling, leading to reduced food intake and loss of body weight.((PMID:27512998))Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the disease, an in vitro model is important. In the 1990s, we used the SV40 large T antigen to immortalize dopaminergic neurons derived from Embryonic Day 14 rat mesencephalon. We selected a clone for its high expression of dopaminergic neuron markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and we named it 1RB3AN27 (N27). Because the original N27 cell line has been passaged many times, the line has become a mixture of cell types with highly variable expression of TH. In the current study, we have performed multiple rounds of clonal cultures and have identified a dopaminergic cell clone expressing high levels of TH and the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have named this new clone N27-A. Nearly 100% of N27-A cells express TH, DAT and Tuj1. Western blots have confirmed that N27-A cells have three to four times the levels of TH and DAT compared to the previous mixed population in N27. Further analysis has shown that the new clone expresses the dopamine neuron transcription factors Nurr1, En1, FoxA2 and Pitx3. The N27-A cells express the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), but do not express dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DβH), the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine. Functional analysis has shown that N27-A cells are more sensitive than N27 cells to neurotoxins taken up by the dopamine transporter such as 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+). The DAT inhibitor nomifensine can block MPP+ induced toxicity. The non-selective toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide were similar in both cell lines. The N27-A cells show dopamine release under basal and depolarization conditions. We conclude that the new N27-A clone of the immortalized rat dopaminergic cell line N27 should provide an improved in vitro model for Parkinson's disease research.((PMID:27501760))Hepatocytes from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) are expected to be a useful source for cell transplantation. However, relatively low efficiency and repeatability of hepatic differentiation of human BM-MSCs remains an obstacle for clinical translation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), a critical transcription factor, plays an essential role in the entire process of liver development. In this study, immortalized hBM-MSCs, UE7T-13 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing HNF4α. The typical fibroblast-like morphology of the MSCs changed, and polygonal, epithelioid cells grew out after HNF4α transduction. In hepatocyte culture medium, HNF4α-transduced MSCs (E7-hHNF4α cells) strongly expressed the albumin (ALB), CYP2B6, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), and FOXA2 mRNA and exhibited morphology markedly similar to that of mature hepatocytes. The E7-hHNF4α cells showed hepatic functions such as Indocyanine green (ICG) uptake and release, glycogen storage, urea production and ALB secretion. Approximately 28% of E7-hHNF4α cells expressed both ALB and AAT. Furthermore, these E7-hHNF4α cells via superior mesenteric vein (SMV) injection expressed human ALB in mouse chronic injured liver. In conclusion, this study represents a novel strategy by directly inducing hepatocyte-like cells from MSCs.((PMID:27481213))This study examines a pretreatment strategy to strengthen the hepatic lineage divergence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).BMSCs were expanded in the presence or absence of nanofiber (NF) and treated with growth factors (GF) prior to transplantation. Thioacetamide (TA) was used for liver fibrosis induction and transplantation of NF-expanded BMSCs was compared biochemically and histologically to the cells expanded without NF scaffold.The ultraweb NF caused better proliferation and characterization of MSCs. MSCs transplantation significantly improved liver functions, increased hepatic HGF and Bcl-2 levels, whereas decreased serum fibronectin, hepatic TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels. Hepatic HNF4α, FOXa2, CYP7a1 genes expression were enhanced while β-5-Tub and AFP genes expression were depressed. Histological study documented these results. Differentiated NF-MSCs showed pronounced enhancement of the aforementioned parameters as compared to differentiated MSCs in the absence of NF.pretreatment with growth factors in the presence of NF augment homing, repopulation and hepatic differentiation abilities of MSCs and proves to be a promising approach for the treatment of liver fibrosis.((PMID:27467521))ELOVL family member 6, elongation of very long chain fatty acids (Elovl6) is a microsomal enzyme, which regulates the elongation of C12-16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Elovl6 has been shown to be associated with various pathophysiologies including insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. To investigate a potential role of Elovl6 during bone development, we here examined a skeletal phenotype of Elovl6 knockout (Elovl6-/-) mice. The Elovl6-/- skeleton was smaller than that of controls, but exhibited no obvious patterning defects. Histological analysis revealed a reduced length of proliferating and an elongated length of hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, and decreased trabecular bone in Elovl6-/- mice compared with controls. These results were presumably due to a modest decrease in chondrocyte proliferation and accelerated differentiation of cells of the chondrocyte lineage. Consistent with the increased length of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer in Elovl6-/- mice, Collagen10α1 was identified as one of the most affected genes by ablation of Elovl6 in chondrocytes. Furthermore, this elevated expression of Collagen10α1 of Elovl6-null chondrocytes was likely associated with increased levels of Foxa2/a3 and Mef2c mRNA expression. Relative increases in protein levels of nuclear Foxa2 and cytoplasmic histone deacethylase 4/5/7 were also observed in Elovl6 knockdown cells of the chondrocyte lineage. Collectively, our data suggest that Elovl6 plays a critical role for proper development of embryonic growth plate.((PMID:27466203))The ZIC2 transcription factor is one of the genes most commonly mutated in Holoprosencephaly (HPE) probands. Studies in cultured cell lines and mice have shown a loss of ZIC2 function is the pathogenic mechanism but the molecular details of this ZIC2 requirement remain elusive. HPE arises when signals that direct morphological and fate changes in the developing brain and facial primordia are not sent or received. One critical signal is sent from the prechordal plate (PrCP) which develops beneath the ventral forebrain. An intact NODAL signal transduction pathway and functional ZIC2 are both required for PrCP establishment. We now show that ZIC2 acts downstream of the NODAL signal during PrCP development. ZIC2 physically interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3, the receptor activated proteins that control transcription in a NODAL dependent manner. Together SMAD3 and ZIC2 regulate FOXA2 transcription in cultured cells and Zic2 also controls the foxA2 expression during Xenopus development. Variant forms of the ZIC2 protein, associated with HPE in man or mouse, are deficient in their ability to influence SMAD-dependent transcription. These findings reveal a new mechanism of NODAL signal transduction in the mammalian node and provide the first molecular explanation of how ZIC2 loss-of-function precipitates HPE.((PMID:27430660))Currently, there are emerging multiple studies on human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) in ovarian cancer. HE4 possesses higher sensitivity and specificity than CA125 in the confirmative early diagnosis for ovarian cancer. Although much attention has been given to explore its clinical application, research of the basic mechanisms of HE4 in ovarian cancer are still unclear. In the present study, we provide fundamental data to identify full-scale differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to HE4 by use of human whole-genome microarrays in human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line ES-2 following overexpression and silencing of HE4. We found that a total of 717 genes were upregulated and 898 genes were downregulated in the HE4-overexpressing cells vs. the HE4-Mock cells, and 166 genes were upregulated and 285 were downregulated in the HE4-silenced cells vs. the HE4-Mock cells. An overlap of 16 genes consistently upregulated and 8 genes downregulated in response to HE4 were noted. These DEGs were involved in MAPK, steroid biosynthesis, cell cycle, the p53 hypoxia pathway, and focal adhesion pathways. Interaction network analysis predicted that the genes participated in the regulatory connection. Highly differential expression of the FOXA2, SERPIND1, BDKRD1 and IL1A genes was verified by quantitative real-time PCR in 4 cell line samples. Finally, SERPIND1 (HCII) was validated at the protein level by immunohistochemistry in 107 paraffin-embedded ovarian tissues. We found that SERPIND1 may act as a potential oncogene in the development of ovarian cancer. The present study displayed the most fundamental and full-scale data to show DEGs in response to HE4. These identified genes may provide a theoretical basis for investigations of the underlying molecular mechanism of HE4 in ovarian cancer.((PMID:27391166))Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived endodermal cells are of interest for the development of cellular therapies to treat disorders such as liver failure. The soluble form of activin A (Act) has been widely used as an in vitro inducer of definitive endoderm (DE). In this study, we have developed a nanofibrous poly (ɛ-caprolactone) substrate, biofunctionalized with Act, for directed differentiation of hESCs into DE. Bioconjugation of Act on nanofibrous meshes was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunostaining. In order to investigate the bioactivity of immobilized Act (iAct), hESCs were cultivated on the Act-conjugated nanofibers for five days. The nanofibers with covalent iAct significantly increased expression levels of the endodermal markers SOX17, FOXA2, and CXCR4, compared with physically adsorbed Act (aAct) or without Act (noAct). In addition, iAct retained its bioactivity after storage for five days in the absence of cell seeding. The capability of cultivated cells to generate the DE-derived lineage was evaluated through further differentiation of seeded cells into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Interestingly, the iAct sample showed a higher level of hepatic markers compared to the aAct sample. We also demonstrated that iAct in the presence of soluble Act (sAct) could improve the conventional protocol to generate HLCs from hESCs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hypoxia has been demonstrated to play an important role in embryonic formation and development and to modulate stem cell differentiation. However, the influence of oxygen tension on thyroid differentiation has not been studied. In this study, we used murine induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for thyroid cell differentiation under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and compared differentiation efficiency in morphology, function, gene and protein expression under both conditions. We found that hypoxia promoted adhesion and outgrowth of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from murine iPS cells. Expression of endodermal markers (Foxa2 and Gata4) and thyroid transcription factors (Pax8 and Nkx2.1) was increased by hypoxia at both gene and protein levels during early-mid differentiation stages (p<0.05). And so were the thyroid specific markers NIS and TSHR at the end of the experiment (p<0.05). In addition, functional iodide uptake by differentiated cells was also increased after hypoxia. Thyroid differentiation from iPS cells is enhanced under hypoxia and this may involve hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) and their downstream gene FGF2. Our data offer a foundation for understanding thyroid development and provide a potentially more efficient way to use cell therapy for treating thyroid deficiency.((PMID:27343168)): The progressive death of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is the principal cause of symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Stem cells have potential therapeutic use in replacing these cells and restoring function. To facilitate development of this approach, we sought to establish a preclinical model based on a large nonhuman primate for testing the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based transplantation. To this end, we differentiated baboon fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (biPSCs) into dopaminergic neurons with the application of specific morphogens and growth factors. We confirmed that biPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons resemble those found in the human midbrain based on cell type-specific expression of dopamine markers TH and GIRK2. Using the reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we also showed that biPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons express PAX6, FOXA2, LMX1A, NURR1, and TH genes characteristic of this cell type in vivo. We used perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that biPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons fired spontaneous rhythmic action potentials and high-frequency action potentials with spike frequency adaption upon injection of depolarizing current. Finally, we showed that biPSC-derived neurons released catecholamines in response to electrical stimulation. These results demonstrate the utility of the baboon model for testing and optimizing the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PD.Functional dopamine neurons were produced from baboon induced pluripotent stem cells, and their properties were compared to baboon midbrain cells in vivo. The baboon has advantages as a clinically relevant model in which to optimize the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Baboons possess crucial neuroanatomical and immunological similarities to humans, and baboon pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into functional neurons that mimic those in the human brain, thus laying the foundation for the utility of the baboon model for evaluating stem cell therapies.((PMID:27299363))As known from model organisms, such as frog, fish, mouse, and chicken, the anterior-posterior patterning of the definitive endoderm (DE) into distinct domains is controlled by a variety of signaling interactions between the DE and its surrounding mesoderm. This includes Wnt/FGFs and BMPs in the posterior half and all-trans-retinoic acid, TGF-β-ligands, Wnt-, and BMP-inhibitors in the anterior half of the DE sheet. However, it is currently unclear how these embryonic tissue interactions can be translated into a defined differentiation protocol for human embryonic stem cells. Activin A has been proposed to direct DE into a SOX2-positive foregut-like cell type. Due to the pleiotropic nature of SOX2 in pluripotency and developing cells of the foregut, we purified DE-cells by magnetic cell sorting and tested the effects of anteriorizing and posteriorizing factors on pure endoderm. We show in contrast to previous studies that the generation of the foregut marked by SOX2/FOXA2 double-positive cells does not depend on activin A/TGF-β-signaling but is mediated by the inhibition of Wnt- and BMP-signaling. Retinoic acid can posteriorize and at the same time dorsalize the foregut toward a PDX1-positive pancreatic duodenal cell type whereas active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling synergistically with FGF-2, BMP-4, and RA induces the formation of CDX2-positive posterior endoderm. Thus, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms behind cell specification of human DE derived from pluripotent stem cells.

While orthotopic transplantation into the testis promotes seminomatous growth of the seminoma-like cell line TCam-2, ectopic xenotransplantation into the flank initiates reprogramming into an EC-like fate.During this reprogramming, BMP signaling is inhibited, leading to induction of NODAL signaling, upregulation of pluripotency factors and downregulation of seminoma markers, like SOX17. The pluripotency factor and EC-marker SOX2 is strongly induced.Here, we adressed the molecular role of SOX2 in this reprogramming. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing, we established SOX2-deficient TCam-2 cells. Xenografting of SOX2-deficient cells into the flank of nude mice resulted in maintenance of a seminoma-like fate, indicated by the histology and expression of OCT3/4, SOX17, TFAP2C, PRDM1 and PRAME. In SOX2-deficient cells, BMP signaling is inhibited, but NODAL signaling is not activated. Thus, SOX2 appears to be downstream of BMP signaling but upstream of NODAL activation. So, SOX2 is an essential factor in acquiring an EC-like cell fate from seminomas.A small population of differentiated cells was identified resembling a mixed non-seminoma. Analyses of these cells revealed downregulation of the pluripotency and seminoma markers OCT3/4, SOX17, PRDM1 and TFAP2C. In contrast, the pioneer factor FOXA2 and its target genes were upregulated, suggesting that FOXA2 might play an important role in induction of non-seminomatous differentiation.((PMID:26892307))We have previously shown that exposure to phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) causes an increase in the expression of the transcription factor otx2 in the olfactory epithelium (OE) of juvenile zebrafish, and this change is correlated with the formation of an odor memory of PEA. Here, we show that the changes in otx2 expression are specific to βPEA: exposure to αPEA did not affect otx2 expression. We identified 34 olfactory receptors (ORs) representing 16 families on 4 different chromosomes as candidates for direct regulation of OR expression via Otx2. Subsequent in silico analysis uncovered Hnf3b binding sites closely associated with Otx2 binding sites in the regions flanking the ORs. Analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq of OR expression in developing zebrafish exposed to different isoforms of PEA showed that a subset of ORs containing both Otx2/Hnf3b binding sites were downregulated only in βPEA-exposed juveniles and this change persisted through adult life. Localization of OR expression by in situ hybridization indicates the downregulation occurs at the level of RNA and not the number of cells expressing a given receptor. Finally, analysis of immediate early gene expression in the OE did not reveal changes in c-fos expression in response to either αPEA or βPEA.((PMID:26550126))Lung carcinoma is the most common and aggressive malignant tumor with poor clinical outcome. Identification of new marker of lung cancer is essential for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and find associated pathways that may function as targets of lung cancer. Gene expression profiling of GSE40791 were downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), including 100 normal specimens and 94 lung cancer samples. The DEGs were screened out by LIMMA package in R language. Besides, novel genes associated with lung cancer were identified by co-expression analysis. Then, GO enrichment and transcription binding site analysis were performed on these DEGs, and novel genes were predicted using DAVID. Finally, PPI network was constructed by String software in order to get the hub codes involved in cancer carcinoma. A total of 541 DEGs were filtered out between normal samples and patients with lung carcinoma, including 155 up-regulated genes and 386 down-regulated genes. Additionally, nine novel genes, CA4, CDC20, CHRDL1, DLGAP5, EMCN, GPM6A, NUSAP1, S1PR1 and TCF21, were figured out. The transcription biding site analysis showed that these genes were regulated by LHX3, HNF3B, CDP, HFH1, FOXO4, STAT, SOX5, MEF2, FOXO3 and SRY. Hub codes as BUB1B, MAD2L and TOP2A may play as target genes in lung carcinoma in the result of PPI network analysis. Newly predicted genes and hub codes can perform as target genes for diagnose and clinical therapy of lung cancer.((PMID:26547717))Tracheo-oesophageal malformations result from disturbed foregut separation during early development. The notochord, a specialised embryonic structure, forms immediately adjacent to the dividing foregut. In the Adriamycin mouse model of oesophageal atresia, foregut and notochord abnormalities co-exist, and the site and severity of foregut malformations closely correlate to the position and extent of the notochord defects. Notochord and foregut abnormalities also co-exist in the Noggin Knockout mouse as well in a small number of human cases. The notochord is a source of powerful molecular signals during early embryogenesis, being particularly important for neural crest development. The influence of notochord signaling on the adjacent foregut is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of notochord manipulation on foregut separation using a robust 3D explant method for culturing isolated foregut which permits oeosphageal and tracheal formation in vitro.Foregut was micro-dissected from embryonic day 9 mice (License B100/4447 Irish Medicines Board), embedded in collagen and cultured for 48 h with native notochord intact (n = 6), notochord removed (n = 10) or additional notochord transplanted from stage matched controls (n = 8). Specimens were analysed for foregut morphology and molecular patterning using immunohistochemistry for Hnf3b (an endoderm marker) and Sox2 (a notochord and oesophageal marker) on cryosections.Foregut separation into distinct oesophagus and trachea was observed in isolated foregut specimens with or without their native notochord. In specimens with additional notochord transplants, foregut morphology and molecular patterning were comparable to controls whether or not the native notochord was maintained. In particular foregut separation was not disrupted by the transplantation of additional notochord at the dorsal foregut endoderm.The relationship between the embryonic foregut and notochord is complex and ill-defined; however, the notochord does not contribute essentially to oesophagus and trachea formation beyond E9 in the mouse, and the transplantation of additional notochord does not disrupt foregut separation in 3D explant culture.((PMID:24047406))Severe shortage of liver donors and hepatocytes highlights urgent requirement of extra-liver and stem cell source of hepatocytes for treating liver-related diseases. Here we hypothesized that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can directly transdifferentiate to hepatic stem-like cells capable of differentiating into mature hepatocyte-like cells in vitro without an intervening pluripotent state.SSCs first changed into hepatic stem-like cells since they resembled hepatic oval cells in morphology and expressed Ck8, Ck18, Ck7, Ck19, OV6, and albumin. Importantly, they co-expressed CK8 and CK19 but not ES cell markers. Hepatic stem-like cells derived from SSCs could differentiate into small hepatocytes based upon their morphological features and expression of numerous hepatic cell markers but lacking of bile epithelial cell hallmarks. Small hepatocytes were further coaxed to differentiate into mature hepatocyte-like cells, as identified by their morphological traits and strong expression of Ck8, Ck18, Cyp7a1, Hnf3b, Alb, Tat, Ttr, albumin, and CYP1A2 but not Ck7 or CK19. Notably, these differentiated cells acquired functional attributes of hepatocyte-like cells because they secreted albumin, synthesized urea, and uptake and released indocyanine green. Moreover, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 rather than Akt was activated in hepatic stem cells and mature hepatocytes. Additionally, cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E transcripts and proteins but not cyclin D1 or CDK1 and CDK2 transcripts or proteins were reduced in mature hepatocyte-like cells or hepatic stem-like cells derived from SSCs compared to SSCs.SSCs can transdifferentiate to hepatic stem-like cells capable of differentiating into cells with morphological, phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature hepatocytes via the activation of ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 signaling pathways and the inactivation of cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E. This study thus provides an invaluable source of mature hepatocytes for treating liver-related diseases and drug toxicity screening and offers novel insights into mechanisms of liver development and cell reprogramming.((PMID:19917631))Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a mediator of apoptotic systems, is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in lung and breast tumors. This gene has a CpG island extending 2500 bp from the translational start site; however, studies characterizing its transcriptional regulation have not been conducted. Two transcripts for DAPK were identified that code for a single protein, while being regulated by two promoters. The previously identified DAPK transcript designated as exon 1 transcript was expressed at levels 3-fold greater than the alternate exon 1b transcript. Deletion constructs of promoter 1 identified a 332 bp region containing a functional CP2-binding site important for expression of the exon 1 transcript. While moderate reporter activity was seen in promoter 2, the region comprising intron 1 and containing a HNF3B-binding site sustained expression of the alternate transcript. Sequencing the DAPK CpG island in tumor cell lines revealed dense, but heterogenous methylation of CpGs that blocked access of the CP2 and HNF3B proteins that in turn, was associated with loss of transcription that was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Prevalences were similar for methylation of promoter 1 and 2 and intron 1 in lung tumors, but significantly greater in promoter 2 and intron 1 in breast tumors, indicative of tissue-specific differences in silencing these two transcripts. These studies show for the first time dual promoter regulation of DAPK, a tumor suppressor gene silenced in many cancers, and substantiate the importance of screening for silencing of both transcripts in tumors.((PMID:19617899))Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs have a significant role in tumor development and may constitute robust biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and functional relevance of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report that miR-122 is specifically repressed in a subset of primary tumors that are characterized by poor prognosis. We further show that the loss of miR-122 expression in tumor cells segregates with specific gene expression profiles linked to cancer progression, namely the suppression of hepatic phenotype and the acquisition of invasive properties. We identify liver-enriched transcription factors as central regulatory molecules in the gene networks associated with loss of miR-122, and provide evidence suggesting that miR-122 is under the transcriptional control of HNF1A, HNF3A and HNF3B. We further show that loss of miR-122 results in an increase of cell migration and invasion and that restoration of miR-122 reverses this phenotype. In conclusion, miR-122 is a marker of hepatocyte-specific differentiation and an important determinant in the control of cell migration and invasion. From a clinical point of view, our study emphasizes miR-122 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC progression.((PMID:19521719))One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24. The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect, affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism develop, has been suggested. We investigated a family, including one twin, with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence. Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic. We identified no mutations in ZFP57, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF3B, IPF1, PAX4, or ZIC3. The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci IGF2R, DIRAS3, and PEG1, while the other family members, including the healthy monozygotic twin, had normal findings. The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome, which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence.((PMID:19074951))Mammalian tissue- and/or time-specific transcription is primarily regulated in a combinatorial fashion through interactions between a specific set of transcriptional regulatory factors (TRFs) and their cognate cis-regulatory elements located in the regulatory regions. In exploring the DNA regions and TRFs involved in combinatorial transcriptional regulation, we noted that individual knockdown of a set of human liver-enriched TRFs such as HNF1A, HNF3A, HNF3B, HNF3G and HNF4A resulted in perturbation of the expression of several single TRF genes, such as HNF1A, HNF3G and CEBPA genes. We thus searched the potential binding sites for these five TRFs in the highly conserved genomic regions around these three TRF genes and found several putative combinatorial regulatory regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that almost all of the putative regulatory DNA regions were bound by the TRFs as well as two coactivators (CBP and p300). The strong transcription-enhancing activity of the putative combinatorial regulatory region located downstream of the CEBPA gene was confirmed. EMSA demonstrated specific bindings of these HNFs to the target DNA region. Finally, co-transfection reporter assays with various combinations of expression vectors for these HNF genes demonstrated the transcriptional activation of the CEBPA gene in a combinatorial manner by these TRFs.((PMID:14728801))Enhancer II (ENII) is one of the critical cis-elements in the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) genome for the hepatic viral gene transcription and DNA replication. The liver-specific activity of ENII is regulated by multiple liver-enriched transcription factors, including LRH-1/hB1F, HNF1, HNF3b, HNF4 and C/EBP. Knowledge on the interplay of these important factors is still limited. In this study, we demonstrate a functional synergism between the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1/hB1F and the homeoprotein HNF1 in up-regulating the liver-specific activity of ENII. This synergism is sufficient for initiating the viral gene transcription and DNA replication in non-hepatic cells. We have defined the activation domains in hB1F and HNF1 that contribute to the synergism. We further show that hB1F and HNF1 can interact directly in vitro and have mapped the domains required for this interaction.((PMID:12620499))Angiotensin II has been shown to exert complex effects on proximal tubular cell function and growth. To assess some of the direct effects on proximal tubular cells, changes in gene expression of selected cellular pathways were determined after exposure to angiotensin II. We used DNA microarrays to analyze multiple gene expression responses to increasing angiotensin II concentrations. Human proximal tubular cells were grown in flasks, and the presence of angiotensin type 1 receptor was confirmed by Western blot analysis. At passages 4-6, these cells were exposed to angiotensin II and harvested 4 h later and mRNA of the cells was extracted; 2 microg of mRNA was fluorescently conjugated for cDNA microarray hybridization. A custom-made DNA microarray was designed by selecting 300 human genes from 10 different functional systems and amplifying clones using polymerase chain reaction. Cells were subjected to 10 and 100 nM angiotensin II with paired untreated cells as controls. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, labeled and hybridized to the arrays and the ratios calculated. Ratios of > or =2.0 and < or =0.5 were considered significant. Coordinated changes were observed in genes of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 family (NHF3; HNF3A, HNF3B and HNF3G), in the E2F genes (E2F1, E2F3) and the interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF5. Induction of the expression of transcription factors points towards complex regulation of gene expression upon angiotensin II exposure. Three genes involved in the dampening of oxidative stress were enhanced. Taken together, brief exposure of human tubular epithelial cells to angiotensin II elicited a marked induction of nuclear factors, antioxidant genes and hormones and hormone receptor genes. The quick activation of transcription factors by angiotensin II indicates that angiotensin II can directly initiate a cascade of expressional events in proximal tubular cells.((PMID:12064915))We have discovered two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of the HFE gene. These mutations are -970 T-->G and -467 C-->G, numbering from the ATG start codon. When a T was present at -970, a C was always found at -467. The C allele was the less common at nt -467 with a gene frequency of 0.31 in white subjects with wild-type HFE. Slightly lower gene frequencies were observed in a small number of Hispanic and African-American subjects and a slightly higher frequency in a few Asian subjects. The less common -467 mutation was found in almost 12 chromosomes that bore the 845G-->A (C282Y) mutation and was significantly more prevalent in chromosomes containing the 187C-->G (H63D) mutation. Although this mutation is near an HNF3B/HFH2 site, its presence did not seem to affect iron metabolism as judged by the serum ferritin or transferrin saturation levels. The tighter association of the -467 polymorphism with the C282Y mutation is consistent with other data that suggest that the C282Y mutation has occurred relatively recently and that the H63D mutation is considerably older.((PMID:11311937))We cloned and characterized the mouse gene for microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A, an important protein for neuronal morphology and mitotic spindle formation. We also investigated the 5' untranslated region of the gene to characterize the promoter units. Two alternative transcripts different in the 5' region were identified by 5' RACE. Both transcripts were principally observed in the brain. Genomic cloning revealed that exons 1, 2, and 4 generate the 5' part of a long transcript, whereas exons 3 and 4 generate a short transcript. Putative 5' and intronic promoters flanking exons 1 and 3, respectively, are GC-rich and lack a canonical TATA box. DNase I footprinting from mouse cells revealed that several potential cis-elements were occupied by nuclear proteins. A reporter assay system in conjunction with a number of deletion and mutation constructs was used to test the two putative promoters. Both putative promoters showed transactivity and their function was dependent upon Sp1 sites. In addition, an NF-1 site, an HNF3B site, and an AP-1/ATF site were necessary for basal promoter activity of the intronic promoter. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms that govern the expression of the MAP1A gene.((PMID:10868949))Mutations in genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) are responsible for three of the five subtypes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). This observation and molecular studies indicate that the HNF network is required for normal function of pancreatic beta-cells. This suggests that transcription factors involved in this complex network are candidates for genetic defects in MODY. Because the HNF-3beta gene is implicated in this network, we screened it for mutations in 21 probands of French ancestry with clinical diagnosis of MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes. All of the five known MODY genes, HNF-4alpha, glucokinase, HNF-1alpha, HNF-1beta, and IPF1, were previously excluded as being the cause of diabetes in these families. By direct sequencing, we identified two transitions, an A-to-G at position -213 and a C-to-T at position -63 in the promoter and exon 1, respectively, of the HNF-3beta gene. A G-to-C transversion at position +32 in the intron 1 and three transitions, C-to-T at position 291, A-to-G at position 837, and G-to-A at position 1188 in the exon 3, resulting in noncoding mutations Ala97Ala, Gly279Gly, and Gln396Gln, respectively, were also identified. The allele frequencies were not significantly different between a control group and MODY probands. Familial segregation studies and linkage analysis showed that genetic variation in the HNF-3beta gene is unlikely to be the cause of early-onset type 2 diabetes in these Caucasian families.((PMID:10868948))Mutations in the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha and -1alpha, insulin promoter factor-1, and HNF-1beta are the causes of four forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1 and 3-5, respectively). The winged-helix transcription factor HNF-3beta has been implicated in the regulation of expression of each of these MODY genes, suggesting that mutations in the HNF-3beta gene (HNF3B) may also cause MODY. We have tested this hypothesis by screening a panel of 57 unrelated Japanese subjects with a clinical diagnosis of MODY for mutations in HNF3B. This analysis revealed four frequent polymorphisms that were not associated with MODY, including one in the promoter region (-213A/G), two silent mutations in the codons for Ala 97 (291C/T) and Gly 279 (837A/G), and one in the 3'-untranslated region (1424C/T). Two rare substitutions in the 5'-untranslated region, -156C/T and -67A/C, were found in a heterozygous state in two subjects, and two subjects were heterozygous for putative missense mutations, S109N (326G > A) and A328V (983C>T). The two missense mutations were not found in 106 normal chromosomes from nondiabetic subjects. It was not possible to test for co-segregation of these mutations with diabetes and thus, it is unclear whether or not these mutations can cause MODY. The results of our study suggest that mutations in HNF3B are not a common cause of MODY in Japanese subjects.((PMID:9730593))((PMID:9119385))((PMID:15358835))Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor and acts as a coregulator of various nuclear receptors. Herein, we examined a novel cross talk between SHP and a forkhead transcription factor HNF3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3/Foxa. Transient transfection assay demonstrated that SHP inhibited the transcriptional activity of all three isoforms of HNF3, HNF3alpha, beta, and gamma. In vivo and in vitro protein interaction studies showed that SHP physically interacted with HNF3. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP significantly decreased the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphase (G6Pase), cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in HepG2 cells and rat primary hepatocytes. Moreover, the mRNA level of G6Pase was notably increased by down-regulation of SHP with small interfering RNA. Interestingly, HNF3 transactivity was still repressed by SHPDelta128-139 that fails to repress nuclear receptors. Mapping of interaction domain revealed that SHP interacted with forkhead DNA binding domain of HNF3alpha. Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SHP inhibits DNA binding of HNF3. These results suggest that SHP is involved in the regulation of G6Pase, CYP7A1, and PEPCK gene expression via novel mechanism of inhibition of HNF3 activity and expand the role of SHP as a coregulator of other family of transcription factors in addition to nuclear receptors.((PMID:21210253))In vitro production of human hepatocytes is of primary importance in basic research, pharmacotoxicology and biotherapy of liver diseases. We have developed a protocol of differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ES) towards hepatocyte-like cells (ES-Hep). Using a set of human adult markers including CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4/7 ratio (HNF4alpha1/HNF4alpha7), cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), CYP3A4 and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and fetal markers including alpha-fetoprotein, CYP3A7 and glutathione S-transferase P1, we analyzed the expression of a panel of 41 genes in ES-Hep comparatively with human adult primary hepatocytes, adult and fetal liver. The data revealed that after 21 days of differentiation, ES-Hep are representative of fetal hepatocytes at less than 20 weeks of gestation. The glucocorticoid receptor pathway was functional in ES-Hep. Extending protocols of differentiation to 4 weeks did not improve cell maturation. When compared with hepatocyte-like cells derived from adult liver non parenchymal epithelial (NPE) cells (NPE-Hep), ES-Hep expressed several adult and fetal liver makers at much greater levels (at least one order of magnitude), consistent with greater expression of liver-enriched transcription factors Forkhead box A2, C/EBPalpha, HNF4alpha and HNF6. It therefore seems that ES-Hep reach a better level of differentiation than NPE-Hep and that these cells use different lineage pathways towards the hepatic phenotype. Finally we showed that lentivirus-mediated expression of xenoreceptor CAR in ES-Hep induced the expression of several detoxification genes including CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, UDP-glycosyltransferase 1A1, solute carriers 21A6, as well as biotransformation of midazolam, a CYP3A4-specific substrate.((PMID:24380658))On the basis of their self-renewal capacity and their ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers, germ line-derived multipotent adult stem cells (maGSCs) from mouse testis might serve as one of preferable sources for pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine. In our study, we aimed for an efficient hepatic differentiation protocol that is applicable for both maGSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We attempted to accomplish this goal by using a new established co-culture system with OP9 stroma cells for direct differentiation of maGSCs and ESCs into hepatic cells. We found that the hepatic differentiation of maGSCs was induced by the OP9 co-culture system in comparison to the gelatin culture. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of OP9 co-culture with activin A resulted in the increased expression of endodermal and early hepatic markers Gata4, Sox17, Foxa2, Hnf4, Afp, and Ttr compared to differentiated cells on gelatin or on OP9 alone. Moreover, the hepatic progenitors were capable of differentiating further into mature hepatic cells, demonstrated by the expression of liver-specific markers Aat, Alb, Tdo2, Krt18, Krt8, Krt19, Cps1, Sek, Cyp7a1, Otc, and Pah. A high percentage of maGSC-derived hepatic progenitors (51% AFP- and 61% DLK1-positive) and mature hepatic-like cells (26% ALB-positive) were achieved using this OP9 co-culture system. These generated hepatic cells successfully demonstrated in vitro functions associated with mature hepatocytes, including albumin and urea secretion, glycogen storage, and uptake of low-density lipoprotein. The established co-culture system for maGSCs into functional hepatic cells might serve as a suitable model to delineate the differentiation process for the generation of high numbers of mature hepatocytes in humans without genetic manipulations and make germ line-derived stem cells a potential autologous and alternative cell source for hepatic transplants in metabolic liver disorders.((PMID:17086172))When differentiated in the presence of activin A in serum-free conditions, mouse embryonic stem cells efficiently generate an endoderm progenitor population defined by the coexpression of either Brachyury, Foxa2 and c-Kit, or c-Kit and Cxcr4. Specification of these progenitors with bone morphogenetic protein-4 in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor and activin A results in the development of hepatic populations highly enriched (45-70%) for cells that express the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin proteins. These cells also express transcripts of Afp, Alb1, Tat, Cps1, Cyp7a1 and Cyp3a11; they secrete albumin, store glycogen, show ultrastructural characteristics of mature hepatocytes, and are able to integrate into and proliferate in injured livers in vivo and mature into hepatocytes expressing dipeptidyl peptidase IV or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. Together, these findings establish a developmental pathway in embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures that leads to efficient generation of cells with an immature hepatocytic phenotype.((PMID:21850186))Corneal epithelium is maintained by a population of stem cells (SCs) that have not been identified by specific molecular markers. The objective of this study was to find new putative markers for these SCs and to identify associated molecular pathways.Real time PCR (rt-PCR) was performed in 24 human limbal and central corneal epithelial samples to evaluate the gene expression profile of known corneal epithelial SC-associated markers. A pool of those samples was further analyzed by a rt-PCR array (RT²-PCR-A) for 84 genes related to the identification, growth, maintenance, and differentiation of SCs.Cells from the corneal epithelium SC niche showed significant expression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) and cytokeratin (KRT)15, KRT14, and KRT5 genes. RT²-PCR-A results indicated an increased or decreased expression in 21 and 24 genes, respectively, in cells from the corneal SC niche compared to cells from the central corneal epithelium. Functional analysis by proprietary software found 4 different associated pathways and a novel network with the highest upregulated genes in the corneal SC niche. This led to the identification of specific molecules, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), islet-1 transcription factor LIM/homeodomain (ISL1), collagen-type II alpha 1 (COL2A), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), aggrecan (ACAN), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), Gap junction protein beta 1/connexin 32 (GJB1/Cnx32), and Msh homeobox 1 (MSX1), that could be used to recognize putative corneal epithelial SCs grown in culture and intended for transplantation. Other molecules, NCAM1 and GJB1/Cnx32, potentially could be used to positively purify them, and Par-6 partitioning defective 6 homolog alpha (PARD6A) to negatively purify them.Knowledge of these gene and molecular pathways has provided a better understanding of the signaling molecular pathways associated with progenitor-rich limbal epithelium. This knowledge potentially could give support to the design and development of innovative therapies with the potential to reverse corneal blindness arising from ocular surface failure.((PMID:26929406))FoxO1 binds to insulin response elements located in the promoters of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), activating their expression. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 promotes cytoplasmic translocation, inhibiting FoxO1-mediated transactivation. We have previously demonstrated that FoxO1 opens and remodels chromatin assembled from the IGFBP1 promoter via a highly conserved winged helix motif. This finding, which established FoxO1 as a "pioneer" factor, suggested a model whereby FoxO1 chromatin remodeling at regulatory targets facilitates binding and recruitment of additional regulatory factors. However, the impact of FoxO1 phosphorylation on its ability to bind chromatin and the effect of FoxO1 loss on recruitment of neighboring transcription factors at its regulatory targets in liver chromatin is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that an amino acid substitution that mimics insulin-mediated phosphorylation of a serine in the winged helix DNA binding motif curtails FoxO1 nucleosome binding. We also demonstrate that shRNA-mediated loss of FoxO1 binding to the IGFBP1 and G6Pase promoters in HepG2 cells significantly reduces binding of RNA polymerase II and the pioneer factors FoxA1/A2. Knockdown of FoxA1 similarly reduced binding of RNA polymerase II and FoxO1. Reduction in acetylation of histone H3 Lys-27 accompanies loss of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 binding. Interdependent binding of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 possibly entails cooperative binding because FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 facilitate one another's binding to IGFPB1 promoter DNA. These results illustrate how transcription factors can nucleate transcriptional events in chromatin in response to signaling events and suggest a model for regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through interdependent FoxO/FoxA binding.((PMID:25299227))The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is crucial for pattern formation in early central nervous system development. By systematically analyzing high-throughput in situ hybridization data of E11.5 mouse brain, we found that Shh and its receptor Ptch1 define two adjacent mutually exclusive gene expression domains: Shh+Ptch1- and Shh-Ptch1+. These two domains are associated respectively with Foxa2 and Gata3, two transcription factors that play key roles in specifying them. Gata3 ChIP-seq experiments and RNA-seq assays on Gata3-knockdown cells revealed that Gata3 up-regulates the genes that are enriched in the Shh-Ptch1+ domain. Important Gata3 targets include Slit2 and Slit3, which are involved in the process of axon guidance, as well as Slc18a1, Th and Qdpr, which are associated with neurotransmitter synthesis and release. By contrast, Foxa2 both up-regulates the genes expressed in the Shh+Ptch1- domain and down-regulates the genes characteristic of the Shh-Ptch1+ domain. From these and other data, we were able to reconstruct a gene regulatory network governing both domains. Our work provides the first genome-wide characterization of the gene regulatory network involved in the Shh pathway that underlies pattern formation in the early mouse brain.((PMID:23534516))To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of Bleomycin A5 on infancy hemangioma.After intralesional injection of Bleomycin A5 into the tumor of animal model of infancy hemangioma, the variation of tumor form was and the variation of tumor structure were observed using light microscope and electron microscope, the variation of tumor gene expression spectra was also tested by DNA microarray technique.After treatment, the tumor gradually shrunk, hardened, disappeared one month later. The tumor lost appearance of infancy hemangioma and replaced by lamellar collagen fibers and cellular nucleus scattered in the fibers, and almost all cells were necrotic and dissolved. Under electron microscope, only large stretches of dissolved cell could be seen without intact cells and blood vessels, but apoptotic cells and bodies could also be found. The results of DNA microarray analysis showed that 9 genes associated with apoptosis (murine double minute 2, heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit, lymphotoxin B receptor, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily 7, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 21, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A, myeloid cell leukemia-1, caspase3), 13 genes associated with cell proliferation and cell cycle (cell division cycle27, cell division cycle37, CDC28 protein kinase 1B, cycling B1, cullin 2, cullin 3, cullin 4A, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45A, meiotic recombination 11 homolog B, forkhead box M1, minichromosome maintenance 7, antigen identified by monoclonal antibody ki 67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and 11 genes associated with cellular stress and toxic reaction (glutathione peroxidase 1, metallothioneins, superoxide dismutase-1, heat shock protein A1A, heat shock protein A2, heat shock protein A4, heat shock protein A5, heat shock protein 9B, heat shock protein CA, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor)were up or down regulated more than 2 folds in tumors treated with Bleomycin A5 compared with controls.The therapeutic effect of Bleomycin A5 on infancy hemangioma is the synthetic results of multiple factors. Bleomycin A5 could not only induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, but also depressed the ability of cell stress and toxic reaction.((PMID:21685154))Receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) are cell-surface receptors expressed by pulmonary tissue that influence alveolar type (AT) II-ATI transition required for normal alveolar formation. However, the precise contribution of RAGE in interactions between pulmonary epithelium and splanchnic mesenchyme during lung organogenesis remains uncertain. To test the hypothesis that RAGE misexpression adversely affects lung morphogenesis, conditional transgenic mice were generated that overexpress RAGE. Mice that overexpress RAGE throughout embryogenesis experienced 100% mortality and significant lung hypoplasia coincident with large, vacuous areas in the periphery when compared with normal airway and alveolar architecture observed in control mouse lungs. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry employing cell-specific markers for distal (forkhead box protein A2) and respiratory (thyroid transcription factor-1) epithelium, ATII cells (pro-surfactant protein-C), and ATI cells (T1-α) demonstrated anomalies in key epithelial cell populations resulting from RAGE up-regulation. These results reveal that precise regulation of RAGE expression is required during lung formation. Furthermore, abundant RAGE results in profound alterations in epithelial cell differentiation that culminate in severe respiratory distress and perinatal lethality.((PMID:18682709))Thyroid carcinoma cells often do not express thyroid-specific genes including sodium iodide symporter (NIS), thyroperoxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TG), and thyrotropin-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Treatment of thyroid carcinoma cells (four papillary and two anaplastic cell lines) with histone deacetylase inhibitors (SAHA or VPA) modestly induced the expression of the NIS gene. The promoter regions of the thyroid-specific genes contained binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 beta (HNF3 beta)/forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP beta). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed decreased expression of HNF3 beta/FoxA2 and TTF-1 mRNA in papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines, when compared with normal thyroid cells. Forced expression of these genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells inhibited their growth. Furthermore, the CpG island in the promoter region of HNF3 beta/FoxA2 was aberrantly methylated; and treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Az) induced its expression. Immunohistochemical staining showed that C/EBP beta was localised in the nucleus in normal thyroid cells but was detected in the cytoplasm in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. Subcellular fractionation of papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines also demonstrated high levels of expression of C/EBP beta in the cytoplasm, suggesting that a large proportion of C/EBP beta protein is inappropriately localised in the cytoplasm. In summary, these findings reveal novel abnormalities in thyroid carcinoma cells.((PMID:17553805))The human gene MUC4 encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is developmentally regulated and expressed along the undifferentiated pseudostratified epithelium, as early as 6.5 weeks during fetal development. Immunohistochemical analysis of Muc4 expression in developing mouse lung and gastrointestinal tract showed a different spatio-temporal pattern of expression before and after cytodifferentiation. The molecular mechanisms governing MUC4 expression during development are, however, unknown. Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF), forkhead box A (FOXA), GATA, and caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (TFs) are known to control cell differentiation of gut endoderm derived-tissues during embryonic development. They also control the expression of cell- and tissue-specific genes and may thus control MUC4 expression. To test this hypothesis, we studied and deciphered the molecular mechanisms responsible for MUC4 transcriptional regulation by these TFs. Experiments using small interfering RNA, cell co-transfection, and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that MUC4 is regulated at the transcriptional level by CDX-1 and -2, HNF-1 alpha and -1 beta, FOXA1/A2, HNF-4 alpha and -4 gamma, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 factors in a cell-specific manner. Binding of TFs was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gel-shift assays. Altogether, these results demonstrate that MUC4 is a target gene of endodermal TFs and thus point out an important role for these TFs in regulating MUC4 expression during epithelial differentiation during development, cancer, and repair.((PMID:15138929))Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) is a winged helix nuclear transcription protein that regulates the expression of genes that are critical to lung morphogenesis, differentiation, and function, including thyroid transcription factor-1, surfactant proteins, and Clara cell secretory protein. We examined the immunoreactivity of Foxa2 in paraffin sections of 75 lung tumors: 17 typical carcinoids, 2 atypical carcinoids, 4 large cell neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas, 23 small cell carcinomas, 19 adenocarcinomas, 7 squamous cell carcinomas, and 3 (non-NE) large cell carcinomas, using a polyclonal rabbit Foxa2 antibody and a biotin-streptavidin detection system. In the adjacent lung, Foxa2 was detected in normal and hyperplastic type II cells. Foxa2 immunoreactivity was detected in 13 typical carcinoids (76%), 2 atypical carcinoids (100%), 2 large cell NE carcinomas (50%), 11 small cell carcinomas (48%), and 1 adenocarcinoma (5%). Squamous cell carcinomas and (non-NE) large cell carcinomas uniformly lacked Foxa2 staining. Expression of Foxa2 in the entire spectrum of NE lung tumors is another indication of differentiation shared by typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large cell NE carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.((PMID:26919626))Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is distinguished by aggressive growth, early dissemination and a poor prognosis at advanced stage. The remarkably high count of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of SCLC allowed for the establishment of permanent CTC cultures at our institution for the first time. CTCs are assumed to have characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, but extravasation of tumors at distal sites is marked by epithelial features. Two SCLC CTC cell lines, namely BHGc7 and BHGc10, as well as SCLC cell lines derived from primary tumors and metastases were analyzed for the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers and growth factors. Expression of E-cadherin and β-Catenin were determined by flow cytometry. Stem cell-associated markers SOX17, α-fetoprotein, OCT-3/4, KDR, Otx2, GATA-4, Nanog, HCG, TP63 and Goosecoid were not expressed in the 2 CTC lines. In contrast, high expression was found for HNF-3β/FOXA2, SOX2, PDX-1/IPF1 and E-cadherin. E-cadherin expression was restricted to the 2 CTCs and 2 cell lines derived from pleural effusion (SCLC26A) and bone metastases (NCI-H526), respectively. Thus, these SCLC CTCs established from extended disease SCLC patients lack expression of stem cell markers which suppress the epithelial phenotype. Instead they express high levels of E-cadherin consistent with a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET or EMrT) and form large tumorospheres possibly in response to the selection pressure of first-line chemotherapy. HNF-3β/FOXA2 and PDX-1/IPF1 expression seem to be related to growth factor dependence on insulin/IGF-1 receptors and IGF-binding proteins.((PMID:26774761))A major challenge in tissue engineering is to develop robust protocols for differentiating ES and iPS cells to functional adult tissues at a clinically relevant scale. The goal of this study is to develop a high throughput platform for generating bioactive, stem cell-laden microgels to direct differentiation in a well-defined microenvironment. We describe a droplet microfluidics system for fabricating microgels composed of polyethylene glycol and heparin, with tunable geometric, mechanical, and chemical properties, at kHz rates. Heparin-containing hydrogel particles sequestered growth factors Nodal and FGF-2, which are implicated in specifying pluripotent cells to definitive endoderm. Mouse ESCs were encapsulated into heparin microgels with a single dose of Nodal and FGF-2, and expressed high levels of endoderm markers Sox17 and FoxA2 after 5 days. These results highlight the use of microencapsulation for tailoring the stem cell microenvironment to promote directed differentiation, and may provide a straightforward path to large scale bioprocessing in the future.Multicellular spheroids and microtissues are valuable for tissue engineering, but fabrication approaches typically sacrifice either precision or throughput. Microfluidic encapsulation in polymeric biomaterials is a promising technique for rapidly generating cell aggregates with excellent control of microenvironmental parameters. Here we describe the microfluidic fabrication of bioactive, heparin-based microgels, and demonstrate the adsorption of heparin-binding growth factors for enhancing directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells toward endoderm. This approach also facilitated a ∼90-fold decrease in consumption of exogenous growth factors compared to conventional differentiation protocols.((PMID:26519998))Gonadotropin-releasing hormone III (GnRH3) is considered to be a key neurohormone in fish reproduction control. In the present study, the cDNA and genomic sequences of GnRH3 were cloned and characterized from large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea. The cDNA encoded a protein of 99 amino acids with four functional motifs. The full-length genome sequence was composed of 3797 nucleotides, including four exons and three introns. Higher identities of amino acid sequences and conserved exon-intron organizations were found between LcGnRH3 and other GnRH3 genes. In addition, some special features of the sequences were detected in partial species. For example, two specific residues (V and A) were found in the family Sciaenidae, and the unique 75-72 bp type of the open reading frame 2 and 3 existed in the family Cyprinidae. Analysis of the 2576 bp promoter fragment of LcGnRH3 showed a number of transcription factor binding sites, such as AP1, CREB, GATA-1, HSF, FOXA2, and FOXL1. Promoter functional analysis using an EGFP reporter fusion in zebrafish larvae presented positive signals in the brain, including the olfactory region, the terminal nerve ganglion, the telencephalon, and the hypothalamus. The expression pattern was generally consistent with the endogenous GnRH3 GFP-expressing transgenic zebrafish lines, but the details were different. These results indicate that the structure and function of LcGnRH3 are generally similar to the other teleost GnRH3 genes, but there exist some distinctions among them.((PMID:26512061))Dlx5 and Dlx6 are two closely associated homeobox genes which code for transcription factors involved in the control of steroidogenesis and reproduction. Inactivation of Dlx5/6 in the mouse results in a Leydig cell defect in the male and in ovarian insufficiency in the female. DLX5/6 are also strongly expressed by the human endometrium but their function in the uterus is unknown. The involvement of DLX5/6 in human uterine pathology is suggested by their strong downregulation in endometriotic lesions and upregulation in endometrioïd adenocarcinomas. We first show that Dlx5/6 expression begins in Müllerian ducts epithelia and persists then in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelia throughout post-natal maturation and in the adult. We then use a new mouse model in which Dlx5 and Dlx6 can be simultaneously inactivated in the endometrium using a Pgr(cre/+) allele. Post-natal inactivation of Dlx5/6 in the uterus results in sterility without any obvious ovarian involvement. The uteri of Pgr(cre/+); Dlx5/6(flox/flox) mice present very few uterine glands and numerous abnormally large and branched invaginations of the uterine lumen. In Dlx5/6 mutant uteri, the expression of genes involved in gland formation (Foxa2) and in epithelial remodelling during implantation (Msx1) is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we show that DLX5 is highly expressed in human endometrial glandular epithelium and that its expression is affected in endometriosis. We conclude that Dlx5 and Dlx6 expression determines uterine architecture and adenogenesis and is needed for implantation. Given their importance for female reproduction, DLX5 and DLX6 must be regarded as interesting targets for future clinical research.((PMID:26341558))Despite the fact that the majority of lung cancer deaths are due to metastasis, the molecular mechanisms driving metastatic progression are poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that loss of Foxa2 and Cdx2 synergizes with loss of Nkx2-1 to fully activate the metastatic program. These three lineage-specific transcription factors are consistently down-regulated in metastatic cells compared with nonmetastatic cells. Knockdown of these three factors acts synergistically and is sufficient to promote the metastatic potential of nonmetastatic cells to that of naturally arising metastatic cells in vivo. Furthermore, silencing of these three transcription factors is sufficient to account for a significant fraction of the gene expression differences between the nonmetastatic and metastatic states in lung adenocarcinoma, including up-regulated expression of the invadopodia component Tks5long, the embryonal proto-oncogene Hmga2, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal mediator Snail. Finally, analyses of tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model and patients show that low expression of Nkx2-1, Foxa2, and Cdx2 strongly correlates with more advanced tumors and worse survival. Our findings reveal that a large part of the complex transcriptional network in metastasis can be controlled by a small number of regulatory nodes that function redundantly, and loss of multiple nodes is required to fully activate the metastatic program.((PMID:25934574))In contrast to the growing interests in studying noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNA (miRNA or miR) pharmacoepigenetics, there is a lack of efficient means to cost effectively produce large quantities of natural miRNA agents. Our recent efforts led to a successful production of chimeric pre-miR-27b in bacteria using a transfer RNA (tRNA)-based recombinant RNA technology, but at very low expression levels. Herein, we present a high-yield expression of chimeric pre-miR-1291 in common Escherichia coli strains using the same tRNA scaffold. The tRNA fusion pre-miR-1291 (tRNA/mir-1291) was then purified to high homogeneity using affinity chromatography, whose primary sequence and post-transcriptional modifications were directly characterized by mass spectrometric analyses. Chimeric tRNA/mir-1291 was readily processed to mature miR-1291 in human carcinoma MCF-7 and PANC-1 cells. Consequently, recombinant tRNA/mir-1291 reduced the protein levels of miR-1291 target genes, including ABCC1, FOXA2, and MeCP2, as compared with cells transfected with the same doses of control methionyl-tRNA scaffold with a sephadex aptamer (tRNA/MSA). In addition, tRNA-carried pre-miR-1291 suppressed the growth of MCF-7 and PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly enhanced the sensitivity of ABCC1-overexpressing PANC-1 cells to doxorubicin. These results indicate that recombinant miR-1291 agent is effective in the modulation of target gene expression and chemosensitivity, which may provide insights into high-yield bioengineering of new ncRNA agents for pharmacoepigenetics research.((PMID:25843708))Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes, including cell lineage specification. Here, we report transcriptome profiling of human endoderm and pancreatic cell lineages using purified cell populations. Analysis of the data sets allows us to identify hundreds of lncRNAs that exhibit differentiation-stage-specific expression patterns. As a first step in characterizing these lncRNAs, we focus on an endoderm-specific lncRNA, definitive endoderm-associated lncRNA1 (DEANR1), and demonstrate that it plays an important role in human endoderm differentiation. DEANR1 contributes to endoderm differentiation by positively regulating expression of the endoderm factor FOXA2. Importantly, overexpression of FOXA2 is able to rescue endoderm differentiation defects caused by DEANR1 depletion. Mechanistically, DEANR1 facilitates FOXA2 activation by facilitating SMAD2/3 recruitment to the FOXA2 promoter. Thus, our study not only reveals a large set of differentiation-stage-specific lncRNAs but also characterizes a functional lncRNA that is important for endoderm differentiation.((PMID:25503986))Pancreatic β-cell failure is central to the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. We recently demonstrated that β-cells become hypoxic under high glucose conditions due to increased oxygen consumption and that the pancreatic islets of diabetic mice but not those of control mice are moderately hypoxic. However, the impact of moderate hypoxia on β-cell number and function is unknown. In the present study, moderate hypoxia induced a hypoxic response in MIN6 cells, as evidenced by increased levels of HIF-1α protein and target genes. Under these conditions, a selective downregulation of Mafa, Pdx1, Slc2a2, Ndufa5, Kcnj11, Ins1, Wfs1, Foxa2, and Neurod1, which play important roles in β-cells, was also observed in both MIN6 cells and isolated pancreatic islets. Consistent with the altered expression of these genes, abnormal insulin secretion was detected in hypoxic MIN6 cells. Most of the hypoxia-induced gene downregulation in MIN6 cells was not affected by the suppression of HIF-1α, suggesting a HIF-1-independent mechanism. Moderate hypoxia also induced apoptosis in MIN6 cells. These results suggest that hypoxia is a novel stressor of β-cells and that hypoxic stress may play a role in the deterioration of β-cell function.((PMID:25190258))The applications of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cells in regenerative medicine has encountered a long-standing challenge: how can we efficiently obtain mature cell types from hPSCs? Attempts to address this problem are hindered by the complexity of controlling cell fate commitment and the lack of sufficient developmental knowledge for guiding hPSC differentiation. Here, we developed a systematic strategy to study hPSC differentiation by labeling sequential developmental genes to encompass the major developmental stages, using the directed differentiation of pancreatic β cells from hPSCs as a model. We therefore generated a large panel of pancreas-specific mono- and dual-reporter cell lines. With this unique platform, we visualized the kinetics of the entire differentiation process in real time for the first time by monitoring the expression dynamics of the reporter genes, identified desired cell populations at each differentiation stage and demonstrated the ability to isolate these cell populations for further characterization. We further revealed the expression profiles of isolated NGN3-eGFP(+) cells by RNA sequencing and identified sushi domain-containing 2 (SUSD2) as a novel surface protein that enriches for pancreatic endocrine progenitors and early endocrine cells both in human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived pancreatic cells and in the developing human pancreas. Moreover, we captured a series of cell fate transition events in real time, identified multiple cell subpopulations and unveiled their distinct gene expression profiles, among heterogeneous progenitors for the first time using our dual reporter hESC lines. The exploration of this platform and our new findings will pave the way to obtain mature β cells in vitro.((PMID:23775071))The transcription factor MafA is a key regulator of insulin gene expression and maturation of islet β cells. Despite its importance, the regulatory mechanism of MafA gene expression is still unclear. To identify the transcriptional regulators of MafA, we examined various transcription factors, which are potentially involved in β cell differentiation. An adenovirus-mediated overexpression study clearly demonstrated that Onecut1 suppresses the promoter activity of MafA through the Foxa2-binding cis-element on the MafA enhancer region (named area A). However, ChIP analysis showed that Foxa2 but not Onecut1 could directly bind to area A. Furthermore, overexpression of Onecut1 inhibited the binding of Foxa2 onto area A upon ChIP analysis. Importantly, insertion of a mutation in the Foxa2-binding site of area A significantly decreased the promoter activity of MafA. These findings suggest that Onecut1 suppresses MafA gene expression through the Foxa2-binding site. In the mouse pancreas, MafA expression was first detected at the latest stage of β cell differentiation and was scarcely observed in Onecut1-positive cells during pancreas development. In addition, Onecut1 expression was significantly increased in the islets of diabetic db/db mice, whereas MafA expression was markedly decreased. The improved glucose levels of db/db mice with insulin injections significantly reduced Onecut1 expression and rescued the reduction of MafA expression. These in vivo experiments also suggest that Onecut1 is a negative regulator of MafA gene expression. This study implicates the novel role of Onecut1 in the control of normal β cell differentiation and its involvement in β cell dysfunction under diabetic conditions by suppressing MafA gene expression.((PMID:23672958))Epigenetic regulation offers a flexible means to instruct cell functions and fate. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), thousands of genes are targets for histone modifications leading to activation or suppression of transcription. Novel research now indicates that, in hESCs, the transcription start site of FOXA2, encoding a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, is bivalently marked with histone modifications for both gene activation and repression. Moreover, FOXA2 is remarkably upregulated at an early stage of endothelial differentiation. These discoveries provide better understanding of the natural program of differentiation and also open up new opportunities for large scale production of endothelial progenitors.((PMID:23269676))MafA and Pdx1 represent critical transcriptional regulators required for the maintenance of pancreatic islet β-cell function. The in vivo β-cell-enriched expression pattern of these genes is principally directed by islet transcription factors binding within conserved Region 3 (base pairs (bp) -8118/-7750) of MafA and Area II (bp -2153/-1923) of the Pdx1 gene. Comprehensive mutational analysis of conserved MafA Region 3 revealed two new β-cell line-specific cis-activation elements, termed Site 4 (bp -7997 to -7988) and Site 12 (bp -7835 to -7826). Gel mobility and antibody super-shift analysis identified Pdx1 as the Site 4 binding factor, while an 80-88 kilodalton (kDa) β-cell line-enriched protein complex bound Site 12 and similar aligned nucleotides within Pdx1 Area II. The 80-88 kDa activator was also found in adult mouse islet extract. Strikingly, the molecular weight, DNA binding, and antibody recognition properties of this activator were unique when compared with all other key islet transcription factors tested, including Prox1 (83 kDa), Hnf1α (67 kDa), FoxA2 (48 kDa), MafA (46 kDa), Isl1 (44 kDa), Pdx1 (42 kDa), and Nkx2.2 (30 kDa). Collectively, these data define an apparently novel MafA Region 3 and Pdx1 Area II activator contributing to expression in β-cells.((PMID:23060003))Neuroendocrine (NE) prostate tumors and neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostatic adenocarcinomas have been associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we used the TRAMP mouse model that develops NE prostate tumors to identify key factors that can lead to NED. We have previously reported that NE tumors express the forkhead transcription factor, Foxa2, Mash1 (mouse achaete scute homolog-1), as well as Synaptophysin. In TRAMP, the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) first expresses Foxa2 and Synaptophysin, which then progresses to NE cancer. In order to determine if Foxa2 is dispensable for development or maintenance of NE cancer, a conditional knock-out of Foxa2 in TRAMP mice was generated by breeding mice with two floxed alleles of Foxa2 and one copy of Nkx3.1-Cre. Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice showed loss of Foxa2 expression in embryonic prostatic buds. No expression of Foxa2 was seen in the adult prostate in either conditional null or control mice. Foxa2 is universally expressed in all wild type TRAMP NE tumors, but Mash1 expression is seen only in a few samples in a few cells. With the loss of Foxa2 in the NE tumors of the TRAMP/Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice, the expression of the pro-neuronal gene Mash1 is upregulated. NE tumors from both the TRAMP control and Foxa2-deficient TRAMP prostate express Synaptophysin and SV40 Large T-antigen, and both show a loss of androgen receptor expression in NE cells. These studies suggest that the TRAMP NE tumors can form in the absence of Foxa2 by an up regulation of Mash1.((PMID:22737085))Gene duplication is a powerful driver of evolution. Newly duplicated genes acquire new roles that are relevant to fitness, or they will be lost over time. A potential path to functional relevance is mutation of the coding sequence leading to the acquisition of novel biochemical properties, as analyzed here for the highly homologous paralogs Foxa1 and Foxa2 transcriptional regulators. We determine by genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-Seq) that, although Foxa1 and Foxa2 share a large fraction of binding sites in the liver, each protein also occupies distinct regulatory elements in vivo. Foxa1-only sites are enriched for p53 binding sites and are frequently found near genes important to cell cycle regulation, while Foxa2-restricted sites show only a limited match to the forkhead consensus and are found in genes involved in steroid and lipid metabolism. Thus, Foxa1 and Foxa2, while redundant during development, have evolved divergent roles in the adult liver, ensuring the maintenance of both genes during evolution.((PMID:22495882))LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (Lmx1a) is required for the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, roof plate formation, and cortical hem development. We generated a reporter embryonic stem cell (ESC) line for Lmx1a and used it to track differentiation and extract neural progenitors from differentiating mouse ESCs. Lmx1a(+) cells gave rise to functional cortical upper layer GABAergic neurons or dopaminergic neurons depending on the culture conditions used for differentiation. Under chemically defined neurobasal conditions, ESC differentiation resulted in widespread and transient expression of Lmx1a, without the addition of exogenous factors such as sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnts, and/or bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Under neutral conditions, Lmx1a(+) cells express genes known to be downstream of Lmx1a and cortical hem markers Wnt3a and p73. The majority of these cells did not express the ventral midbrain dopaminergic marker Foxa2 or dorsal roof plate marker BMP-2. Lmx1a(+) -Foxa2(-) cells were primed to become SatB2(+) GABAergic neurons and appeared to be resistant to dopaminergic patterning cues. PA6 coculture produced a substantial population of Lmx1a(+) progenitors that also expressed Foxa2 and on further differentiation gave rise to dopaminergic neurons at high frequency. We conclude that Lmx1a is a useful marker for the extraction of progenitors of GABAergic or dopaminergic neurons. We caution against the assumption that it indicates dopaminergic commitment during in vitro differentiation of ESCs. Indeed, in monolayer culture under neurobasal conditions, with or without the addition of Shh and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), Lmx1a(+) cells were predominantly progenitors of forebrain GABAergic neurons. We obtained dopaminergic cells in large numbers only by coculture with PA6 cells.((PMID:22485144))Global gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from human embryonic neural stem cells (hENSC), and adult human olfactory bulb-derived neural stem cells (OBNSCs), to define a gene expression pattern and signaling pathways that are specific for each cell lineage. We have demonstrated large differences in the gene expression profile of human embryonic NSC, and adult human OBNSCs, but less variability between parallel cultures. Transcripts of genes involved in neural tube development and patterning (ALDH1A2, FOXA2), progenitor marker genes (LMX1a, ALDH1A1, SOX10), proliferation of neural progenitors (WNT1 and WNT3a), neuroplastin (NPTN), POU3F1 (OCT6), neuroligin (NLGN4X), MEIS2, and NPAS1 were up-regulated in both cell populations. By Gene Ontology, 325 out of 3875 investigated gene sets were scientifically different. 41 out of the 307 investigated Cellular Component (CC) categories, 45 out of the 620 investigated Molecular Function (MF) categories, and 239 out of the 2948 investigated Biological Process (BP) categories were significant. KEGG Pathway Class Comparison had revealed that 75 out of 171 investigated gene sets passed the 0.005 significance threshold. Levels of gene expression were explored in three signaling pathways, Notch, Wnt, and mTOR that are known to be involved in NS cell fates determination. The transcriptional signature also deciphers the role of genes involved in epigenetic modifications. SWI/SNF DNA chromatin remodeling complex family, including SMARCC1 and SMARCE1, were found specifically up-regulated in our OBNSC but not in hENSC. Differences in gene expression profile of transcripts controlling epigenetic modifications, and signaling pathways might indicate differences in the therapeutic potential of our examined two cell populations in relation to in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation following engraftments in different CNS insults.((PMID:24843545))Aims/Introduction:  We recently established a strategy for isolating multipotential duct-like cells, called pdx-1-positive pancreatic cell-derived (PPPD) cells, from the pancreas. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cell differentiation, we introduced a polyoma-based episomal vector system into PPPD cells.  PPPD cells were stably transfected with a polyoma large T (PLT)-expressing plasmid vector, which included the polyoma origin of replication, to generate PLT-PPPD cells. Various cDNA for pancreas-related transcription factors were subcloned into the expression plasmid pPyCAG, which included the polyoma origin of replication. PLT-PPPD cells were stably transfected with the resulting plasmid vectors and then subjected to gene and protein expression analyses.  The coexpression of Mafa, Neurod1 and Ipf1 induced Ins1 and Ins2 expression in PLT-PPPD cells. The forced expression of Pax6 alone induced the expression of glucagon. The coexpression of Neurod1 and Isl1 induced Ins2 and Sst expression. In contrast, the expression of Ptf1a and Foxa2 induced the expression of exocrine markers Cpa1 and Amy2. Transfections with multiple transcription factors showed that Isl1 is required for the differentiation of both insulin-positive cells and somatostatin-positive cells. In addition, Foxa2 induced the differentiation of glucagon-positive cells and inhibited the differentiation of insulin-positive and somatostatin-positive cells. PLT-PPPD cells allow episomal vector-based gene expression and should be useful for studying the transcription factor cascades involved in the differentiation of pancreatic cell types in vitro.  Our coexpression study showed novel critical roles for Isl1 and Foxa2 in the differentiation of PPPD cells into endocrine cells. (J Diabetes Invest, doi: 10.1111/j.2040-1124.2011.00136.x, 2012).((PMID:21392254))Genetic determinants of plasma levels of protein C (PC) are poorly understood. Recently, we identified a locus on chromosome 20 determining high PC levels in a large Dutch pedigree with unexplained thrombophilia. Candidate genes in the LOD-1 support interval included FOXA2, THBD and PROCR.To examine these candidate genes and their influence on plasma levels of PC.Exons, promoter and 3'UTR of the candidate genes were sequenced in 12 family members with normal to high PC levels. Four haplotypes of PROCR, two SNPs in the neighboring gene EDEM2 and critical SNPs encountered during resequencing were genotyped in the family and in a large group of healthy individuals (the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS) controls). Soluble endothelial protein C receptor (sEPCR) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) plasma levels were measured in the family.PROCR haplotype 3 (H3) and FOXA2 rs1055080 were associated with PC levels in the family but only PROCR H3 was also associated with plasma levels in the healthy individuals. Carriers of both variants had higher PC levels than carriers of only PROCR H3 in the family but not in healthy individuals, suggesting that a second determinant is present. EDEM2 SNPs were associated with PC levels, but their effect was small. PC and sEPCR levels were associated in both studies. sTM was not associated with variations of THBD or PC levels.Chromosome 20 harbors genetic determinants of PC and sEPCR levels and the analysis of candidate genes suggests that the PROCR locus is responsible.((PMID:16010442))Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are implicated in cell-fate determination of embryonic stem (ES) cells and cancer cells. GREM1 (CKTSF1B1 or DAND2) and CER1 (Cerberus 1 or DAND4) are cysteine knot superfamily proteins, functioning as secreted-type BMP antagonists. BMP4 is preferentially expressed in diffuse-type gastric cancer cells. Here, vertebrate BMP4 orthologs were identified and characterized by using bioinformatics for comparative proteomics and comparative genomics analyses. Baboon BMP4 gene within AC153751.2 genome sequence encoded a 408-aa protein, showing A152V and S298P amino-acid substitutions compared with human BMP4. Cow Bmp4, bat Bmp4 and zebrafish bmp4 genes were located within AC149774.2, AC156788.2 and CR391996.2 genome sequences, respectively. Human BMP4 showed 99.5%, 98.0%, 97.8%, 97.1%, 96.3%, 83.3% and 71.1% total-amino-acid identity with baboon BMP4, cow Bmp4, bat Bmp4, mouse Bmp4, rat Bmp4, chicken bmp4 and zebrafish bmp4, respectively. Human BMP4 gene was found consisting of six exons, including novel exon 1C, and known exons 1 (1A or I), 1B (II), 2 (III), 3 (IV) and 4 (V). Forty human BMP4 ESTs started from exon 1, seven from intron 1 (5'-flanking region of exon 2), and two from exon 1C. Fourteen mouse Bmp4 ESTs started from exon 1, and one from intron 1. The 5'-flanking region of exon 1 and exon 1 itself, but not exons 1C and 1B, were well conserved between human BMP4 and rodent Bmp4 genes. The major promoter region of human BMP4 and rodent Bmp4 genes were located within the 5'-flanking region of exon 1. FOXA2, OLF1, and MYC-binding sites were conserved among the major promoter region of human, baboon, cow, bat, mouse and rat BMP4 orthologs.((PMID:25653040))Capicua (CIC) has been implicated in pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and cancer in mammals; however, the in vivo physiological functions of CIC remain largely unknown. Here we show that Cic hypomorphic (Cic-L(-/-)) mice have impaired bile acid (BA) homeostasis associated with induction of proinflammatory cytokines. We discovered that several drug metabolism and BA transporter genes were down-regulated in Cic-L(-/-) liver, and that BA was increased in the liver and serum whereas bile was decreased within the gallbladder of Cic-L(-/-) mice. We also found that levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes were up-regulated in Cic-L(-/-) liver. Consistent with this finding, levels of hepatic transcriptional regulators, such as hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), were markedly decreased in Cic-L(-/-) mice. Moreover, induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfα) expression and decrease in the levels of FOXA2, C/EBPβ, and RXRα were found in Cic-L(-/-) liver before BA was accumulated, suggesting that inflammation might be the cause for the cholestasis in Cic-L(-/-) mice. Our findings indicate that CIC is a critical regulator of BA homeostasis, and that its dysfunction might be associated with chronic liver disease and metabolic disorders.((PMID:24807696))ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause Tangier disease which is characterized by near or complete absence of circulating plasma HDL. In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXRα/RXRα. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene.((PMID:24327960))Cytokine signaling has been connected to regulation of metabolism and energy balance. Numerous cytokine gene expression changes are stimulated by accumulation of bile acids in livers of young Foxa2 liver-conditional null mice. We hypothesized that bile acid-induced inflammation in young Foxa2 mutants, once chronic, affects metabolic homeostasis. We found that loss of Foxa2 in the liver results in a premature aging phenotype, including significant weight gain, reduced food intake, and decreased energy expenditure. We show that Foxa2 antagonizes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in increased hepatic lipogenesis and adiposity. While much prior work has focused on adipose tissue in obesity, we discovered a novel age-onset obesity phenotype in a model where gene deletion occurs only in the liver, underscoring the importance of the role hepatic lipogenesis plays in the development of obesity.((PMID:19417011))Bile acids are powerful detergents produced by the liver to aid in the absorption of dietary lipids. We recently reported a novel role for Foxa2 in bile acid metabolism. The winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required to prevent intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in mice fed a cholic acid-enriched diet. Here, we use functional genomics to study how Foxa2 regulates its targets in a cholic acid-dependent manner. We found that multiple signaling pathways essential for the hepatic response to acute liver injury are impaired in livers of Foxa2-deficient mice, suggesting that the deletion of Foxa2 in the hepatocyte affects the liver on a large scale. We also discovered distinct feed-forward regulatory loops controlling Foxa2-dependent targets in a cholic acid-dependent or -independent manner. We show that Foxa2 interacts with different transcription factors to achieve gene expression responses appropriate for each physiologic state.((PMID:18840356))Homeostatic regulation of bile acid metabolism and biliary lipid secretion is critical to prevent enterohepatic diseases. Kaestner and coworkers (Bochkis et al., 2008) show that loss of forkhead box transcription factor Foxa2 in the liver leads to hepatic injury due to downregulation in the expression levels of bile acid transporters and detoxification enzymes.((PMID:18660816))Production of bile by the liver is crucial for the absorption of lipophilic nutrients. Dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis can lead to cholestatic liver disease and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show by global location analysis ('ChIP-on-chip') and cell type-specific gene ablation that the winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required for normal bile acid homeostasis. As suggested by the location analysis, deletion of Foxa2 in hepatocytes in mice using the Cre-lox system leads to decreased transcription of genes encoding bile acid transporters on both the basolateral and canalicular membranes, resulting in intrahepatic cholestasis. Foxa2-deficient mice are strikingly sensitive to a diet containing cholic acid, which results in toxic accumulation of hepatic bile salts, ER stress and liver injury. In addition, we show that expression of FOXA2 is markedly decreased in liver samples from individuals with different cholestatic syndromes, suggesting that reduced FOXA2 abundance could exacerbate the injury.((PMID:12878321))Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) is a bifunctional protein that plays a central role in carcinogen metabolism and is also able to mediate the sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids into hepatocytes. Studies have identified a subject (S-1) with extremely elevated serum bile salt levels in the absence of observable hepatocellular injury, suggesting a defect in bile acid uptake. In this individual, mEH protein and mEH mRNA levels were reduced by approximately 95% and 85%, respectively, whereas the expression and amino acid sequence of another bile acid transport protein (NTCP) was unaffected. Sequence analysis of the mEH gene (EPHX1) revealed a point mutation at an upstream HNF-3 site (allele I) and in intron 1 (allele II), which resulted in a significant decrease in EPHX1 promoter activity in transient transfection assays. Gel shift assays using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide from each region resulted in specific transcription factor binding patterns, which were altered in the presence of the mutation. These studies demonstrate that the expression of mEH is greatly reduced in a patient with hypercholanemia, suggesting that mEH participates in sodium-dependent bile acid uptake in human liver where its absence may contribute to the etiology of this disease.((PMID:11786957))We previously generated a transgenic mouse line (T-77) in which increased hepatic expression of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta) protein was used to assess its role in hepatocyte-specific gene transcription. The T-77 transgenic mice displayed elevated serum bile acid and bilirubin levels and a complete absence of hepatic glycogen storage. These postnatal liver defects were associated with diminished expression of hepatocyte genes involved in gluconeogenesis and bile acid transport as well as reduced levels of hepatocyte transcription factors. In this study, we show that mouse tail vein injections of adenovirus expressing the rat HNF-3beta (AdHNF3beta) cDNA efficiently increased its levels throughout the liver lobule and recapitulated the T-77 transgenic liver phenotype within several days postinfection. Likewise, the AdHNF3beta-infected liver phenotype was associated with reduced hepatic expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis, bile acid transport, and bilirubin conjugation, which were not found with control adenovirus infections. These studies show that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is an effective method for rapid hepatic increases in transcription factor levels to determine in vivo target genes. In contrast, AdHNF3alpha-infected liver displayed only a transient reduction in hepatic glycogen levels and was associated with less severe decreases in hepatic expression of gluconeogenic and bilirubin metabolism genes. Consistent with these findings, only T-77 transgenic and AdHNF3beta-infected liver exhibited diminished hepatic expression of the HNF-6 transcription factor, suggesting that reduced HNF-6 levels contribute to diminished HNF-3beta-specific transcriptional activity.((PMID:11027295))The winged helix transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta), mediates the hepatocyte-specific transcription of numerous genes important for liver function. However, the in vivo role of HNF-3beta in regulating these genes remains unknown because homozygous null HNF3beta mouse embryos die in utero prior to liver formation. In order to examine the regulatory function of HNF-3beta, we created transgenic mice in which the -3-kb transthyretin promoter functions to increase hepatocyte expression of the rat HNF-3beta protein. Postnatal transgenic mice exhibit growth retardation, depletion of hepatocyte glycogen storage, and elevated levels of bile acids in serum. The retarded growth phenotype is likely due to a 20-fold increase in hepatic expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), which results in elevated levels in serum of IGFBP-1 and limits the biological availability of IGFs required for postnatal growth. The defects in glycogen storage and serum bile acids coincide with diminished postnatal expression of hepatocyte genes involved in gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycogen synthase) and sinusoidal bile acid uptake (Ntcp), respectively. These changes in gene transcription may result from the disruptive effect of HNF-3beta on the hepatic expression of the endogenous mouse HNF-3alpha,-3beta, -3gamma, and -6 transcription factors. Furthermore, adult transgenic livers lack expression of the canalicular phospholipid transporter, mdr2, which is consistent with ultrastructure evidence of damage to transgenic hepatocytes and bile canaliculi. These transgenic studies represent the first in vivo demonstration that the HNF-3beta transcriptional network regulates expression of hepatocyte-specific genes required for bile acid and glucose homeostasis, as well as postnatal growth.((PMID:22877565))We aimed to investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) influences apolipoprotein M (ApoM) expression and pre-β-high-density lipoprotin (HDL) formation, and whether forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and Nur77 are involved in this process.We analyzed the serum VEGF concentrations of 264 adults who underwent a medical checkup and found that VEGF concentration was positively correlated with serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and ApoB concentrations, but was negatively correlated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoM concentrations. We further investigated the effects of VEGF on ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation, and the mechanisms responsible, in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. VEGF markedly downregulated ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation. At the same time, expression of Foxa2 was also inhibited, whereas expression of Nur77 was increased by treatment with VEGF. Furthermore, small interfering (si) RNA knockdown of Foxa2 made the downregulation of VEGF on ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation even more obvious. In addition, siRNA knockdown of Nur77 significantly compensated for the inhibitory effect of VEGF on Foxa2 expression, whereas the Nur77 agonist cytosporone B led to the downregulation of Foxa2 expression more significantly than VEGF. Moreover, overexpression of a Nur77 transgene in C57BL/6 mice resulted in decreased serum ApoM and pre-β-HDL levels, whereas si-Nur77-treated mice displayed upregulated serum ApoM and pre-β-HDL levels.These results provide evidence that VEGF may first downregulate expression of Foxa2 by enhancing Nur77 activity and then decrease expression of ApoM and pre-β-HDL formation. Therefore, our study may be useful in understanding the critical effect of VEGF in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.((PMID:20846698))Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most frequent causes of abnormal liver dysfunction associated with synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. Adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1/R2) and insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1/-2) are known as modulators of these fatty acid metabolisms in the liver; however, the regulatory roles of these receptors in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids are unclear in the liver of NASH. In this study, we examined the roles of hepatic AdipoR1/R2 and IRS-1/-2 in NASH using an animal model. After feeding a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet to obese fa/fa Zucker rats for 8 weeks, rats showed fatty liver spontaneously with inflammation and fibrosis that are characteristic of NASH. The expression levels of AdipoR1/R2 and IRS-2 were significantly decreased, whereas IRS-1 was significantly increased, in NASH. As a result of the decrease of AdipoR1/R2 expression, the messenger RNA expression levels of genes located downstream of AdipoR1/R2, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1/α2, which inhibits fatty acid synthesis, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, which activates fatty acid oxidation, also decreased. Expression level of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c was found to be elevated, suggesting the up-regulation of IRS-1, and resulted in increased fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, increase of forkhead box protein A2 expression was observed, which might be associated with the down-regulation of IRS-2, facilitating fatty acid oxidation. Taken together, increased synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids by up- or down-regulation of AdipoR or IRS may contribute to the progression of NASH. Thus, AdipoR and IRS might be crucially important regulators for the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids in the liver of NASH.((PMID:27247576))The lipophilic statin lovastatin decreases cholesterol synthesis and is a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence points at antitumor potential of lovastatin. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of lovastatin function in different cell types is critical to effective therapy design. In this study, we investigated the effects of lovastatin on the differentiation potential of human embryonic stem (hES) cells (H9 cell line). Multiparameter flow cytometric assay was used to detect changes in the expression of transcription factors characteristic of hES cells. We found that lovastatin treatment delayed NANOG downregulation during ectodermal and endodermal differentiation. Likewise, expression of ectodermal (SOX1 and OTX2) and endodermal (GATA4 and FOXA2) markers was higher in treated cells. Exposure of hES cells to lovastatin led to a minor decrease in the expression of SSEA-3 and a significant reduction in CD133 expression. Treated cells also formed fewer embryoid bodies than control cells. By analyzing hES with and without CD133, we discovered that CD133 expression is required for proper formation of embryoid bodies. In conclusion, lovastatin reduced the heterogeneity of hES cells and impaired their differentiation potential.((PMID:24997396))Characterization of the epigenome promises to yield the functional elements buried in the human genome sequence, thus helping to annotate non-coding DNA polymorphisms with regulatory functions. Here, we develop two novel strategies to combine epigenomic data with transcriptomic profiles in humans or mice to prioritize potential candidate SNPs associated with lipid levels by genome-wide association study (GWAS). First, after confirming that lipid-associated loci that are also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in human livers are enriched for ENCODE regulatory marks in the human hepatocellular HepG2 cell line, we prioritize candidate SNPs based on the number of these marks that overlap the variant position. This method recognized the known SORT1 rs12740374 regulatory SNP associated with LDL-cholesterol, and highlighted candidate functional SNPs at 15 additional lipid loci. In the second strategy, we combine ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and liver expression datasets from knockout mice lacking specific transcription factors. This approach identified SNPs in specific transcription factor binding sites that are located near target genes of these transcription factors. We show that FOXA2 transcription factor binding sites are enriched at lipid-associated loci and experimentally validate that alleles of one such proxy SNP located near the FOXA2 target gene BIRC5 show allelic differences in FOXA2-DNA binding and enhancer activity. These methods can be used to generate testable hypotheses for many non-coding SNPs associated with complex diseases or traits.((PMID:16459311))Forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 activates genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and is regulated by insulin. Activation of Foxa2 in the liver leads to increased oxidation and secretion of fatty acids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs), a process impaired in type 2 diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that Foxa2 is coactivated by PPARgamma coactivator beta (Pgc-1beta). Adenoviral expression of Foxa2 and Pgc-1beta in livers of ob/ob mice results in decreased hepatic TAG content and increased plasma TAG concentrations. In addition, the concerted action of Foxa2/Pgc-1beta activates genes in mitochondrial beta oxidation and enhances fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, Foxa2/Pgc-1beta induce the expression of microsomal transfer protein, thereby increasing apoB-containing VLDL secretion. This process is inhibited by insulin through a Foxa2-dependent mechanism. These data demonstrate that Foxa2/Pgc-1beta regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis by affecting the clearance rate of fatty acids through oxidation and/or secretion of lipids in response to insulin.((PMID:20059580))The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates diverse dioxin toxicities. While the acute effects of activation of the AhR pathway by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have been a focus of past study, the role of this pathway in normal physiology and ageing is unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the portion of the reproductive axis [ovary vs. hypothalamus and pituitary gland (H-H axis)] and the stages of the reproductive lifespan (foetal and early post-natal life vs. adolescence and adulthood) that are particularly sensitive to the effects of TCDD during female reproductive ageing. Adult pregnant Lewis rat dams were dosed with corn oil vehicle or TCDD (50 ng/kg-week by gavage) on days 14 and 21 of gestation and post-natal days 7 and 14 to provide in utero and lactational (IUL) exposure to pups. Female pups (n = 96) were weaned on post-natal day 21 and dosed with TCDD or vehicle weekly. Half of the pups were used as donors for ovary transplantation while the remainder were recipients. Following ovary transplantation, rats (n = 6-8 per group) received weekly TCDD or vehicle again until sacrifice at 8 months of age. Beginning at vaginal opening, reproductive cycles were monitored by vaginal cytology for 10 days each month. Blood samples were collected at 22.00 h on proestrus to measure concentration of 17beta-oestradiol in serum. Real-time PCR was used to determine differences in Cyp1a1, Cyp19a1, Cyp17a1, LH receptor (LHR), FoxA2 and FoxJ1 genes expression between control and remaining groups. IUL exposure of the H-H axis plus adult exposure of the whole body to TCDD significantly delayed puberty in females rats. Data analysis revealed an accelerated onset of acyclicity by 5 months in all groups involving IUL exposure of the developing ovary to TCDD. 17beta-oestradiol was significantly decreased in animals receiving TCDD during IUL exposure of the H-H axis. CYP1a1 expression was markedly greater in the liver than in ovarian tissue and correlated with ongoing TCDD exposure. Aromatase, 17alpha-hydroxylase and LHR gene expressions were largely unchanged (or occasionally elevated) by TCDD. FoxA2 and FoxJ1 mRNAs were similarly of limited value mechanistically, although FoxJ1 was much higher in TTT females (receiving TCDD as donor, recipient and adult). This study reveals a particular sensitivity of the developing ovary to TCDD leading to early loss of reproductive function with age.((PMID:18159929))Xenobiotic and drug metabolism and transport are managed by a large number of genes coordinately regulated by at least three nuclear receptors or xenosensors: aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), and pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2). Initially characterized as xenosensors, it is now evident that CAR and PXR also trigger pleiotropic effects on liver function. Recent studies have shown the existence of crosstalk between xenosensors and other nuclear receptors or transcription factors controlling endogenous signaling pathways which regulate physiological functions. This review is focused on recent observations showing that activation of CAR and PXR alters lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation by interfering with HNF4alpha, FoxO1, FoxA2, PGC1alpha, or NFkB p65. Such crosstalks explain clinical observations and provide molecular mechanisms allowing understanding how xenobiotics and drugs may affect physiological functions and provoke endocrine disruptions.((PMID:15539409))Cytochrome P450 2A2 (CYP2A2) is an adult male-specific rat liver steroid hydroxylase whose sex-dependent expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by sexually dimorphic pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretory patterns. In contrast to CYP2C11 and other male-specific, plasma GH pulse-inducible liver genes, CYP2A2 is highly expressed in hypophysectomized rat liver, despite the absence of GH stimulation. CYP2A2 promoter fragments 0.9-6.2 kb long exhibited unusually high basal promoter activity when transfected into the liver cell line HepG2. A further approximately 2.5-fold increase in activity was obtained by cotransfection of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 3gamma or HNF4alpha. CYP2A2 promoter activity was inhibited approximately 85% by transfection of HNF3beta or HNF6, both of which are more highly expressed in female than male liver and can strongly trans-activate the female-specific CYP2C12 promoter. The male GH pulse-activated transcription factor STAT5b had no effect on CYP2A2 promoter activity, either alone or in combination with HNF3gamma and HNF4alpha, consistent with the GH pulse-independence of CYP2A2 expression. By contrast, STAT5b synergistically enhanced the transcriptional activity of HNF4alpha toward two other male-specific liver target genes, Cyp2d9 and CYP8B1. Furthermore, STAT5b in combination with the HNF4alpha coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha strongly enhanced the transcriptional activity of HNF4alpha toward CYP8B1 but not toward CYP2A2. These findings support the hypothesis that sex-dependent HNFs contribute to the sexually dimorphic expression of CYP2A2 and other liver CYPs and highlight the ability of STAT5b to act in concert with HNF4alpha to regulate select male-specific liver CYP genes.((PMID:22934771))Withdrawal of promising drug candidates is often due to the detection of liver toxicity. In particular the parenchymal liver cells or hepatocytes are targeted since they are the major sites of drug transport and of metabolite formation and thus also the place where not only detoxification, but also activation of new chemical (NCE) and biological (NBE) entities may occur. Therefore, primary hepatocyte- based cultures are currently the preferred in vitro model to screen for liver toxicity. However, within a few days, they undergo dedifferentiation with loss of liver-specific functionality, including xenobiotic biotransformation capacity, making them only suitable for short-term applications. A plausible alternative to primary hepatocyte cultures that can be maintained for longer periods of time could be the use of liver-derived epithelial cell lines and their optimized derivatives. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the stability and the hepatic differentiation potential of a neonatal liver-derived rat epithelial cell line from biliary origin (rLEC). Undifferentiated rLEC stably express the hepatic progenitor markers CEBPA, FOXA2, GJA1, ONECUT1, KRT18 and KRT19 for at least 15 consecutive passages after cryopreservation. Upon sequential exposure to hepatogenic growth factors and cytokines, rLEC generate functional hepatic progeny, expressing mature hepatic markers including Alb, Ahr, Car, C/ebpα, Cx32, Foxa2, Hnf1α, Hnf1β and Onecut1. Furthermore, an active polarization is observed for the hepatic drug transporters Oatp4 and Ntcp. rLEC-derived hepatic cells also acquire the ability to store glycogen, express genes encoding for key hepatic enzymes as shown by Affymetrix microarray data, and display stable CYP1A1/2- and CYP2B1/2-dependent activities for several weeks at levels comparable to those observed in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. The acquisition of such a stable and active biotransformation capacity is key for the applicability of liver-based in vitro models for long-term toxicity testing.((PMID:18305370))Nuclear receptors constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were originally characterized as transcription factors regulating the hepatic genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes. Recent works have now revealed that these nuclear receptors also play the critical roles in modulating hepatic energy metabolism. While CAR and PXR directly bind to their response sequences phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) and xenobiotic responsive enhancer module (XREM) in the promoter of target genes to increase drug metabolism, the receptors also cross talk with various hormone responsive transcription factors such as forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), cAMP-response element binding protein, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC 1alpha) to decrease energy metabolism through down-regulating gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis and up-regulating lipogenesis. In addition, CAR modulates thyroid hormone activity by regulating type 1 deiodinase in the regenerating liver. Thus, CAR and PXR are now placed at the crossroad where both xenobiotics and endogenous stimuli co-regulate liver function.((PMID:17909097))Metformin is an antidiabetic drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to determine whether metformin regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2).We assessed the regulation of hepatic SHP gene expression by Northern blot analysis with metformin and adenovirus containing a constitutive active form of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ad-AMPK) and evaluated SHP, PEPCK, and G6Pase promoter activities via transient transfection assays in hepatocytes. Knockdown of SHP using siRNA SHP was conducted to characterize the metformin-induced inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocytes, and metformin-and adenovirus SHP (Ad-SHP)-mediated hepatic glucose production was measured in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice.Hepatic SHP gene expression was induced by metformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), and Ad-AMPK. Metformin-induced SHP gene expression was abolished by adenovirus containing the dominant negative form of AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), as well as by compound C. Metformin inhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha-or FoxA2-mediated promoter activity of PEPCK and G6Pase, and the inhibition was blocked with siRNA SHP. Additionally, SHP knockdown by adenovirus containing siRNA SHP inhibited metformin-mediated repression of cAMP/dexamethasone-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore, oral administration of metformin increased SHP mRNA levels in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Overexpression of SHP by Ad-SHP decreased blood glucose levels and hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice.We have concluded that metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through AMPK-dependent regulation of SHP.((PMID:25858547))Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is a novel apolipoprotein that was discovered in 1999 and is bound primarily to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in the plasma. Multiple factors may influence its expression at both the post-transcriptional and the transcriptional levels both in vivo and ex vivo as follows: hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α, 4α (HNF-1α, 4α), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and platelet activating factor (PAF) upregulate its expression; liver X receptor (LXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and the majority of cytokines downregulate its expression. However, mechanisms underlying these processes remain unknown. Structurally, there exists a characterized hydrophobic binding pocket within the apoM protein, which enables it to bind functional lipids such as Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P). Functionally, it facilitates the formation of preβ-HDL and enhances an avalanche of atheroprotective effects exerted by HDL. Moreover, in patients with diabetes, the levels of plasma apoM may decrease, whereas the augmentation of apoM decreases plasma glucose levels and magnifies the secretion of insulin. This article offers a panorama of the progress made in the research regarding the characteristics of apoM, particularly the regulation of its expression and its functions.((PMID:26634639))Transdifferentiattion potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) has been suggested recently. In our recent works, we demonstrated the high performance of mouse neonate pancreas extract (MPE) in the production of functional IPCs from carcinoma stem cells. In this study, MPE was used to generate IPCs from MSCs without any genetic manipulation. To this end, bone marrow MSCs were isolated and characterized. In order to differentiate, MSCs were induced by selection of nestin-expressing cells and treatment with 100 μg/mL MPE. Morphological features of the differenti-ated cells were confirmed by dithizone staining. Immunoreactivity to insulin receptor beta, proinsulin, insulin, and C-peptide was observed by immunoflourescence. We also quantified glucose-dependent insulin production and secretion by ELISA. Real-time PCR indicated the expressions of β cell-related genes, PDX-1, INS1, INS2, EP300, and CREB1, in IPC cells. Possible pathways governed by CREB1, EP300, and PDX-1 transcription factors in differentiation of MSCs to IPCs were determined based on Gene Set Enrichment (GSE) approach at P = 0.05. Pathway discovery highlighted the negative regulatory effects of MIR124-2, HDAC5 protein, REST, and NR0B2 transcription factors on expression of CREB1, EP300, and PDX-1 and inhabitation of IPC differentiations. In contrast, a crosstalk between FOXA2 and TCF7L2 transcription factors, DNA-PK complex, KAT2B protein positively interacting with PDX-1, CREB1, EP300 resulted in the induction of IPC and following insulin production. In conclusion, we report an efficient, simple, and easy method for production of functional IPCs from MSCs by MPE treatment.((PMID:26093302))Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-mediated death. Although various therapeutic approaches are used for lung cancer treatment, these mainly target the tumor suppressor p53 transcription factor, which is involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, p53-targeted therapies have limited application in lung cancer, since p53 is found to be mutated in more than half of lung cancers. In this study, we propose tumor suppressor FOXA2 as an alternative target protein for therapies against lung cancer and reveal a possible FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network by identifying new target genes and binding partners of FOXA2 by using various screening techniques. The genes encoding Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2), nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2), cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) were identified as putative target genes of FOXA2. Additionally, the proteins including highly similar to heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90A), heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A variant (HSPA1A), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC3 were identified as novel interacting partners of FOXA2. Moreover, we showed that FOXA2-dependent promoter activation of BAX and p21 genes is significantly reduced via physical interactions between the identified binding partners and FOXA2. These results provide opportunities to understand the FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network and novel therapeutic targets to modulate this network in p53-deficient lung cancer.((PMID:24833708))Retinoic acid (RA) has diverse biological effects. The liver stores vitamin A, generates RA, and expresses receptors for RA. The current study examines the hepatic binding profile of two RA receptor isoforms, RARA (RARα) and RARB (RARβ), in response to RA treatment in mouse livers. Our data uncovered 35,521, and 14,968 genomic bindings for RARA and RARB, respectively. Each expressed unique and common bindings, implying their redundant and specific roles. RARB has higher RA responsiveness than RARB. RA treatment generated 18,821 novel RARB bindings but only 14,798 of RARA bindings, compared with the control group. RAR frequently bound the consensus hormone response element [HRE; (A/G)G(G/T)TCA], which often contained the motifs assigned to SP1, GABPA, and FOXA2, suggesting potential interactions between those transcriptional factors. Functional annotation coupled with principle component analysis revealed that the function of RAR target genes were motif dependent. Taken together, the cistrome of RARA and RARB revealed their extensive biological roles in the mouse liver. RAR target genes are enriched in various biological processes. The hepatic RAR genome-wide binding data can help us understand the global molecular mechanisms underlying RAR and RA-mediated gene and pathway regulation.((PMID:16467259))Previous studies from our group have shown that Foxa1 is expressed in the prostate and interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) to regulate prostate-specific genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and probasin (PB). We report here that Foxa2 but not Foxa1 is expressed in the epididymis. Further, Foxa2 interacts with the AR to regulate the mouse epididymal retinoic acid binding protein (mE-RABP) gene, an epididymis-specific gene. Binding of Foxa2 to the mE-RABP promoter was confirmed by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Overexpression of Foxa2 suppresses androgen activation of the mE-RABP promoter while overexpression of Foxa2 with prostate-specific promoters activates gene expression in an androgen-independent manner. GST pull-down assays determined that both Foxa1 and Foxa2 physically interact with the DNA binding domain of the AR. The interaction between Foxa proteins and AR was further confirmed by gel-shift assays where Foxa protein was recruited to AR binding oligomers even when Foxa binding sites were not present, and AR was recruited to Foxa binding oligomers even in the absence of an AR binding site. Given that Foxa1 and Foxa2 proteins are expressed differentially in the prostate and epididymis, these data suggest that the Foxa proteins have distinct effects on AR-regulated genes in different male reproductive accessory organs.((PMID:11172038))Hepatotropism is a prominent feature of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Cell lines of nonhepatic origin do not independently support HBV replication. Here, we show that the nuclear hormone receptors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 and retinoid X receptor alpha plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, support HBV replication in nonhepatic cells by controlling pregenomic RNA synthesis, indicating these liver-enriched transcription factors control a unique molecular switch restricting viral tropism. In contrast, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 antagonizes nuclear hormone receptor-mediated viral replication, demonstrating distinct regulatory roles for these liver-enriched transcription factors.((PMID:9415428))Posterior neuropore (PNP) closure coincides with the end of gastrulation, marking the end of primary neurulation and primary body axis formation. Secondary neurulation and axis formation involve differentiation of the tail bud mesenchyme. Genetic control of the primary-secondary transition is not understood. We report a detailed analysis of gene expression in the caudal region of day 10 mouse embryos during primary neuropore closure. Embryos were collected at the 27-32 somite stage, fixed, processed for whole mount in situ hybridisation, and subsequently sectioned for a more detailed analysis. Genes selected for study include those involved in the key events of gastrulation and neurulation at earlier stages and more cranial levels. Patterns of expression within the tail bud, neural plate, recently closed neural tube, notochord, hindgut, mesoderm, and surface ectoderm are illustrated and described. Specifically, we report continuity of expression of the genes Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Evx1, Fgf8, RARgamma, Brachyury, and Hoxb1 from primitive streak and node into subpopulations of the tail bud and caudal axial structures. Within the caudal notochord, developing floorplate, and hindgut, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, Shh, and Brachyury expression domains correlate directly with known genetic roles and predicted tissue interdependence during induction and differentiation of these structures. The patterns of expression of Wnt5a, Hoxb1, Brachyury, RARgamma, and Evx1, together with observations on proliferation, reveal that the caudal mesoderm is organised at a molecular level into distinct domains delineated by longitudinal and transverse borders before histological differentiation. Expression of Wnt5a in the ventral ectodermal ridge supports previous evidence that this structure is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. These results provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms facilitating transition from primary to secondary body axis formation, as well as the factors involved in defective spinal neurulation.((PMID:9233805))The signalling molecule Sonic hedgehog is involved in a multitude of distinct patterning processes during vertebrate embryogenesis. In the nascent body axis of the zebrafish embryo, sonic hedgehog is co-expressed with axial (HNF3beta in mammals), a transcription regulator of the winged helix family. We show here that misexpression of axial leads to ectopic activation of sonic hedgehog expression in the zebrafish, suggesting that axial is a regulator of sonic hedgehog transcription. The sonic hedgehog gene was cloned from zebrafish and its promoter was characterized with respect to activation by axial. Expression of axial or rat HNF3beta in HeLa cells results in activation of co-transfected sonic hedgehog promoter-CAT fusion genes. This effect is mediated by two Axial (HNF3beta) recognition sequences. We furthermore identified a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the sonic hedgehog upstream region which can be bound by retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers in vitro and confers retinoic acid inducibility to the sonic hedgehog promoter in the HeLa cell system. Our results suggest that both Axial (HNF3beta) and retinoic acid receptors are direct regulators of the sonic hedgehog gene.((PMID:12834868))Treatment of pseudoglandular stage fetal lungs in vitro with the pan-retinoic acid receptor (pan-RAR) antagonist, BMS493, reduces retinoic acid receptor beta (Rarb) gene expression within the proximal bronchial tubules and increases explant bud formation. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) increases Rarb expression and reduces explant bud formation through a signaling mechanism involving RARbeta. Together these data suggest that RA through RARbeta provides morphogenetic stabilizing activity to the proximal tubules during lung branching morphogenesis. Here we further investigate RA-mediated morphogenetic stabilization of the proximal respiratory tubules during fetal lung development. We demonstrate that Rarb isoform transcripts are the only known Rar transcripts to specifically localize to the proximal tubules and that RAREhsp68lacZ reporter transgene activity reveals endogenous RA signaling activity within these same proximal tubules. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the RA-producing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Raldh1), as well as of transforming growth factor-3beta (Tgfb3), Foxa2, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) within the proximal tubules are all altered by the application of either RA or BMS493 in vitro. We therefore discuss an interbud/proximal tubule signaling niche involving feedback between Rarb expression and Raldh1-mediated synthesis of RA. We suggest that this feedback favors interbud morphogenetic stability by increasing expression of morphoregulatory molecules such as TGFbeta3 and Foxa2, thus promoting bronchial tubule formation rather than continual budding and branching. The relationship between this RAR signaling center and the previously described distal bud signaling center is also addressed.((PMID:17589789))Our goal is to decipher which DNA sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of epididymal genes. At least 6 epididymis-specific lipocalin genes are known. These are differently regulated and regionalized in the epididymis. Lipocalin 5 (Lcn5 or mE-RABP) and Lipocalin 8 (Lcn8 or mEP17) are homologous genes belonging to the epididymis-specific lipocalin gene cluster. Both the 5 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene and the 5.3 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn8 gene can direct transgene expression in the epididymis (Lcn5 to the distal caput and Lcn8 to the initial segment), indicating that these promoter fragments contain important cis-regulatory element(s) for epididymis-specific gene expression. To define further the fragments regulating gene expression, the Lcn5 promoter was examined in transgenic mice and immortalized epididymal cell lines. After serial deletion, the 1.8 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene was sufficient for tissue-specific and region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Transient transfection analysis revealed that a transcription factor forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) interacts with androgen receptor and binds to the 100 bp fragment of the Lcn5 promoter between 1.2 kb and 1.3 kb and that Foxa2 expression inhibits androgen-dependent induction of the Lcn5 promoter activity. Immunohistochemistry indicated a restricted expression of Foxa2 in the epididymis where endogenous Lcn5 gene expression is suppressed and that the Foxa2 inhibition of the Lcn5 promoter is consistent with the lack of expression of Lcn5 in the corpus and cauda. Our approach provides a basic strategy for further analysis of the epididymal lipocalin gene regulation and flexible control of epididymal function.((PMID:16740652))Murine epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein [or lipocalin 5 (Lcn5)] is synthesized and secreted by the principal cells of the mouse middle/distal caput epididymidis. A 5-kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene can dictate androgen-dependent and epididymis region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Here, we reported that the 1.8-kb Lcn5 promoter confers epididymis region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. To decipher the mechanism that directs transcription, 14 chimeric constructs that sequentially removed 100 bp of 1.8-kb Lcn5 promoter were generated and transfected into epididymal cells and nonepididymal cells. Transient transfection analysis revealed that 1.3 kb promoter fragment gave the strongest response to androgens. Between the 1.2-kb to 1.3-kb region, two androgen receptor (AR) binding sites were identified. Adjacent to AR binding sites, a Foxa2 [Fox (Forkhead box) subclass A] binding site was confirmed by gel shift assay. Similar Foxa binding sites were also found on the promoters of human and rat Lcn5, indicating the Foxa binding site is conserved among species. We previously reported that among the three members of Foxa family, Foxa1 and Foxa3 were absent in the epididymis whereas Foxa2 was detected in epididymal principal cells. Here, we report that Foxa2 displays a region-specific expression pattern along the epididymis: no staining observed in initial segment, light staining in proximal caput, gradiently heavier staining in middle and distal caput, and strongest staining in corpus and cauda, regions with little or no expression of Lcn5. In transient transfection experiments, Foxa2 expression inhibits AR induction of the Lcn5 promoter, which is consistent with the lack of expression of Lcn5 in the corpus and cauda. We conclude that Foxa2 functions as a repressor that restricts AR regulation of Lcn5 to a segment-specific pattern in the epididymis.((PMID:25672890))It was recently reported that human periapical cysts (hPCys), a commonly occurring odontogenic cystic lesion of inflammatory origin, contain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. In this study, periapical inflammatory cysts were compared with dental pulp to determine whether this tissue may be an alternative accessible tissue source of MSCs that retain the potential for neurogenic differentiation. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis indicated that hPCy-MSCs and dental pulp stem cells spontaneously expressed the neuron-specific protein β-III tubulin and the neural stem-/astrocyte-specific protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in their basal state before differentiation occurs. Furthermore, undifferentiated hPCy-MSCs showed a higher expression of transcripts for neuronal markers (β-III tubulin, NF-M, MAP2) and neural-related transcription factors (MSX-1, Foxa2, En-1) as compared with dental pulp stem cells. After exposure to neurogenic differentiation conditions (neural media containing epidermal growth factor [EGF], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], and retinoic acid), the hPCy-MSCs showed enhanced expression of β-III tubulin and GFAP proteins, as well as increased expression of neurofilaments medium, neurofilaments heavy, and neuron-specific enolase at the transcript level. In addition, neurally differentiated hPCy-MSCs showed upregulated expression of the neural transcription factors Pitx3, Foxa2, Nurr1, and the dopamine-related genes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter. The present study demonstrated for the first time that hPCy-MSCs have a predisposition toward the neural phenotype that is increased when exposed to neural differentiation cues, based on upregulation of a comprehensive set of proteins and genes that define neuronal cells. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that hPCy-MSCs might be another optimal source of neural/glial cells for cell-based therapies to treat neurologic diseases.((PMID:21351873))The homeobox gene Noto is expressed in the node and its derivative the notochord. Here we use a targeted Noto-GFP reporter to isolate and characterize node/notochord-like cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. We find very few Noto-expressing cells after spontaneous differentiation. However, the number of Noto-expressing cells was increased when using Activin A to induce a Foxa2- and Brachyury-expressing progenitor population, whose further differentiation into Noto-expressing cells was improved by simultaneous inhibition of BMP, Wnt, and retinoic acid signaling. Noto-GFP(+) cells expressed the node/notochord markers Noto, Foxa2, Shh, Noggin, Chordin, Foxj1, and Brachyury; showed a vacuolarization characteristic of notochord cells; and can integrate into midline structures when grafted into Hensen's node of gastrulating chicken embryos. The ability to generate node/notochord-like cells in vitro will aid the biochemical characterization of these developmentally important structures.((PMID:16179348))Agonists for the nuclear receptor peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and its heterodimeric partner, retinoid X receptor (RXR), are effective agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To gain insight into the antidiabetic action of these compounds, we treated female Zucker diabetic rats (ZFF) with AGN194204, which we show to be a homodimer-specific RXR agonist, or the PPARgamma agonist, troglitazone. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in ZFF showed that troglitazone and AGN194204 reduced basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) approximately 30% and doubled the insulin suppression of EGP. AGN194204 had no effect on peripheral glucose utilization, whereas troglitazone increased insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by 50%, glucose uptake into skeletal muscle by 85%, and de novo skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis by 300%. Troglitazone increased skeletal muscle Irs-1 and phospho-Akt levels following in vivo insulin treatment, whereas AGN194204 increased hepatic Irs-2 and insulin stimulated phospho-Akt in liver. Gene profiles of AGN194204-treated mouse liver analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified increases in fatty acid synthetic genes, including Srebp-1 and fatty acid synthase, a pathway previously shown to be induced by RXR agonists. A network of down-regulated genes containing Foxa2, Foxa3, and G-protein subunits was identified, and decreases in these mRNA levels were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Treatment of HepG2 cells with AGN194204 resulted in inhibition of glucagon-stimulated cAMP accumulation suggesting the G-protein down-regulation may provide an additional mechanism for hepatic insulin sensitization by RXR. These studies demonstrate distinct molecular events lead to insulin sensitization by high affinity RXR and PPARgamma agonists.((PMID:19934400))Variability in hepatic CYP3A4 cannot be explained by common CYP3A4 coding variants. We previously identified polymorphisms in pregnane X receptor (PXR) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) associated with CYP3A4 mRNA levels in small cohorts of human livers. However, the relative contributions of these genetic variations or of polymorphisms in other CYP3A4 regulators to variable CYP3A4 expression were not known. We phenotyped livers from white donors (n = 128) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 and nine transcriptional regulators, coactivators, and corepressors. We resequenced hepatic nuclear factor-3-beta (HNF3beta, FoxA2), HNF4alpha, HNF3gamma (FoxA3), nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCoR2), and regions of the CYP3A4 promoter and genotyped informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PXR and ABCB1 in the same livers. CYP3A4 mRNA was positively correlated with PXR and FoxA2 and negatively correlated with NCoR2 mRNA. A common silent polymorphism and a polymorphic trinucleotide (CCT) repeat in FoxA2 were associated with CYP3A4 expression. The transcriptional activity of the FoxA2 polymorphic CCT repeat alleles (wild-type, n = 14 and variant, n = 13, 15, and 19) when assayed by luciferase reporter transactivation assays was greatest for the wild-type repeat, with deviations from this number having decreased transcriptional activity. This corresponded with higher expression of FoxA2 mRNA and its targets PXR and CYP3A4 in human livers with (CCT) n = 14 genotypes. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the contributions of selected genetic polymorphisms to variable CYP3A4 expression. This approach identified sex and polymorphisms in FoxA2, HNF4alpha, FoxA3, PXR, ABCB1, and the CYP3A4 promoter that together explained as much as 24.6% of the variation in hepatic CYP3A4 expression.((PMID:17925385))The hypothesis was tested that sequence diversity in pregnane X receptor (PXR) cis-regulatory regions is a significant determinant of variation in inducible and constitutive CYP3A4 expression. A combination of comparative genomics and computational algorithms was used to select regions of the human PXR promoter and intron 1 that were resequenced in the polymorphism discovery resource 24 DNA subset. PXR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were then genotyped in donor human livers phenotyped for CYP3A4 and multidrug resistance protein 1 mRNA and primary human hepatocytes phenotyped for basal and rifampin-inducible CYP3A4 activity. The human PXR promoter [16.9 kilobase (kb)] was significantly larger than in rodents (2.9 kb). Eighty-nine SNPs were identified in the promoter and intron 1 of PXR. The SNPs most consistently associated with CYP3A4 phenotypic measures were a 44477T>C(-1359) promoter SNP (in linkage disequilibrium with SNP 463970, a 6-base pair deletion in intron 1a, and SNP 46551, a C nucleotide insertion in intron 1b); SNP 63396C>T in intron 1 (in linkage disequilibrium with SNP 63704A>G, a 63813(CAAA)(CA) variable repeat, and SNP 65104T>C); and SNP 56348C>A, SNP 69789A>G, and SNP 66034T>C. Donor livers with the variant PXR alleles had altered hepatic expression of PXR targets compared with livers with PXR wild-type alleles. These results identified PXR promoter and intron 1 SNPs associated with PXR target gene expression (CYP3A4) in donor livers and cultured hepatocytes and that a striking number of the linked intron 1 SNPs will affect putative binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor 3beta (FOXA2), a transcription factor linked with PXR expression.((PMID:17267396))Upon drug activation, the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates not only hepatic drug but also energy metabolism. Using Pxr(-/-) mice, we have now investigated the PXR-mediated repression of lipid metabolism in the fasting livers. Treatment with PXR activator pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) down-regulated the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (in beta-oxidation) and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-CoA synthase 2 (in ketogenesis) in wild-type (Pxr(+/+)) mice only. In contrast, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (in lipogenesis) mRNA was up-regulated in the PCN-treated Pxr(+/+) mice. Reflecting these up- and down-regulations and consistent with decreased energy metabolism, the levels of hepatic triglycerides and of serum 3-hydroxybutylate were increased and decreased, respectively, in the PCN-treated Pxr(+/+) mice. Using gel shift, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and cell-based reporter assays, we then examined whether PXR could cross-talk with the insulin response forkhead factor FoxA2 to repress the transcription of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes, because FoxA2 activates these genes in fasting liver. PXR directly bound to FoxA2 and repressed its activation of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 promoters. Moreover, ChIP assays showed that PCN treatment attenuated the binding of FoxA2 to these promoters in fasting Pxr(+/+) but not Pxr(-/-) mice. These results are consistent with the conclusion that PCN-activated PXR represses FoxA2-mediated transcription of Ctp1a and Hmgcs2 genes in fasting liver.((PMID:15100175))Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major cytochrome P450 present in adult human liver and is involved in the metabolism of over 50% of therapeutic compounds currently in use. Since expression levels of CYP3A4 are regulated by many of these compounds, this raises the potential for drug-drug interactions and subsequent altered efficacy or toxicity of the individual compounds at the dose prescribed. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of CYP3A4 regulation is of key importance in predicting and understanding such interactions. To examine this we have used DNase I footprinting and bioinformatic analysis to identify putative transcription factor binding sites within the 250 base pairs of promoter proximal to the transcription start site. We identified several protected fragments within this region that corresponded to putative binding sites for Sp1, AP2, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha), and hepatic nuclear factor-3 (HNF3), as well as confirming previously identified C/EBPalpha, pregnane X receptor (PXR), and HNF3 binding sites. Sequential site-directed mutagenesis of C/EBPalpha, Sp1, HNF3, and PXR binding sites was next used to examine the role of these sites in basal CYP3A4 expression. Disruption of the C/EBPalpha, HNF3, and PXR binding sites all affected basal expression. Finally, the role of these sites was examined in activation of CYP3A4 expression by rifampicin, metyrapone, clotrimazole, and phenobarbital. Disruption of any of these sites either led to an altered pattern of activation by the xenobiotic, as altered maximal activation, or altered the EC(50) value of activation. Such effects were xenobiotic-specific, with each disrupted site playing a role in the activation of some of the xenobiotics.((PMID:23828045))Streptozotocin (STZ), a glucosamine-nitrosourea compound, has potent genotoxic effects on pancreatic β-cells and is frequently used to induce diabetes in experimental animals. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has β-cell protective effects and is known to preserve β-cells from STZ treatment. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of STZ-induced diabetes and GLP-1-mediated β-cell protection in STZ-treated mice. At 1 week after multiple low-dose STZ administrations, pancreatic β-cells showed impaired insulin expression, while maintaining expression of nuclear Nkx6.1. This was accompanied by significant upregulation of p53-responsive genes in islets, including a mediator of cell cycle arrest, p21 (also known as Waf1 and Cip1). STZ treatment also suppressed expression of a wide range of genes linked with key β-cell functions or diabetes development, such as G6pc2, Slc2a2 (Glut2), Slc30a8, Neurod1, Ucn3, Gad1, Isl1, Foxa2, Vdr, Pdx1, Fkbp1b and Abcc8, suggesting global β-cell defects in STZ-treated islets. The Tmem229B, Prss53 and Ttc28 genes were highly expressed in untreated islets and strongly suppressed by STZ, suggesting their potential roles in β-cell function. When a pancreas-targeted adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector was employed for long-term Glp-1 gene delivery, pancreatic GLP-1 expression protected mice from STZ-induced diabetes through preservation of the β-cell mass. Despite its potent β-cell protective effects, however, pancreatic GLP-1 overexpression showed limited effects on the global gene expression profiles in the islets. Network analysis identified the programmed-cell-death-associated pathways as the most relevant network in Glp-1 gene therapy. Upon pancreatic GLP-1 expression, upregulation of Cxcl13 and Nptx2 was observed in STZ-damaged islets, but not in untreated normal islets. Given the pro-β-cell-survival effects of Cxcl12 (Sdf-1) in inducing GLP-1 production in α-cells, pancreatic GLP-1-mediated Cxcl13 induction might also play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of β-cells in damaged islets.((PMID:15123725))Although the negative regulation of gene expression by insulin has been widely studied, the transcription factors responsible for the insulin effect are still unknown. The purpose of this work was to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the insulin repression of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) gene. Deletion analysis of the 5'-regulatory region allowed us to identify an insulin-responsive region located at -459 to -354 bp. This fragment contains a highly homologous insulin-responsive (IRE) sequence. By transient transfection assays, we determined that hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1) are necessary for an appropriate expression of the ALAS gene. Insulin overrides the HNF3beta or HNF3beta plus NF1-mediated stimulation of ALAS transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Southwestern blotting indicate that HNF3 binds to the ALAS promoter. Mutational analysis of this region revealed that IRE disruption abrogates insulin action, whereas mutation of the HNF3 element maintains hormone responsiveness. This dissociation between HNF3 binding and insulin action suggests that HNF3beta is not the sole physiologic mediator of insulin-induced transcriptional repression. Furthermore, Southwestern blotting assay shows that at least two polypeptides other than HNF3beta can bind to ALAS promoter and that this binding is dependent on the integrity of the IRE. We propose a model in which insulin exerts its negative effect through the disturbance of HNF3beta binding or transactivation potential, probably due to specific phosphorylation of this transcription factor by Akt. In this regard, results obtained from transfection experiments using kinase inhibitors support this hypothesis. Due to this event, NF1 would lose accessibility to the promoter. The posttranslational modification of HNF3 would allow the binding of a protein complex that recognizes the core IRE. These results provide a potential mechanism for the insulin-mediated repression of IRE-containing promoters.((PMID:10559496))During organogenesis, the winged helix hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta (HNF-3beta) protein participates in regulating gene transcription in the developing esophagus, trachea, liver, lung, pancreas, and intestine. Hepatoma cell transfection studies identified a critical HNF-3beta promoter factor, named UF2-H3beta, and here, we demonstrate that UF2-H3beta is identical to the fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF). In situ hybridization studies of mouse embryos demonstrate that FTF expression initiates in the foregut endoderm during liver and pancreatic morphogenesis (day 9) and that earlier expression of FTF is observed in the yolk sac endoderm, branchial arch and neural crest cells (day 8). Abundant FTF hybridization signals are observed throughout morphogenesis of the liver, pancreas, and intestine and its expression continues in the epithelial cells of these adult organs. In day 17 mouse embryos and adult pancreas, however, expression of FTF becomes restricted to the exocrine acinar and ductal epithelial cells.((PMID:26909576))Integrated genomic analysis of 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas identified 32 recurrently mutated genes that aggregate into 10 pathways: KRAS, TGF-β, WNT, NOTCH, ROBO/SLIT signalling, G1/S transition, SWI-SNF, chromatin modification, DNA repair and RNA processing. Expression analysis defined 4 subtypes: (1) squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and (4) aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX) that correlate with histopathological characteristics. Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations, upregulation of the TP63∆N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis. Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2). Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways involved in acquired immune suppression. These data infer differences in the molecular evolution of pancreatic cancer subtypes and identify opportunities for therapeutic development.((PMID:25063451))The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 is necessary for the stem-like properties of the epiblast of the pre-gastrulation embryo and for cellular and physiological homeostasis of endoderm-derived organs postnatally. Using conditional gene inactivation, we show that Nr5a2 also plays crucial regulatory roles during organogenesis. During the formation of the pancreas, Nr5a2 is necessary for the expansion of the nascent pancreatic epithelium, for the subsequent formation of the multipotent progenitor cell (MPC) population that gives rise to pre-acinar cells and bipotent cells with ductal and islet endocrine potential, and for the formation and differentiation of acinar cells. At birth, the NR5A2-deficient pancreas has defects in all three epithelial tissues: a partial loss of endocrine cells, a disrupted ductal tree and a >90% deficit of acini. The acinar defects are due to a combination of fewer MPCs, deficient allocation of those MPCs to pre-acinar fate, disruption of acinar morphogenesis and incomplete acinar cell differentiation. NR5A2 controls these developmental processes directly as well as through regulatory interactions with other pancreatic transcriptional regulators, including PTF1A, MYC, GATA4, FOXA2, RBPJL and MIST1 (BHLHA15). In particular, Nr5a2 and Ptf1a establish mutually reinforcing regulatory interactions and collaborate to control developmentally regulated pancreatic genes by binding to shared transcriptional regulatory regions. At the final stage of acinar cell development, the absence of NR5A2 affects the expression of Ptf1a and its acinar specific partner Rbpjl, so that the few acinar cells that form do not complete differentiation. Nr5a2 controls several temporally distinct stages of pancreatic development that involve regulatory mechanisms relevant to pancreatic oncogenesis and the maintenance of the exocrine phenotype.((PMID:26916619))Recent high-throughput studies revealed recurrent RUNX1 mutations in breast cancer, specifically in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) tumours. However, mechanisms underlying the implied RUNX1-mediated tumour suppression remain elusive. Here, by depleting mammary epithelial cells of RUNX1 in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate combinatorial regulation of AXIN1 by RUNX1 and oestrogen. RUNX1 and ER occupy adjacent elements in AXIN1's second intron, and RUNX1 antagonizes oestrogen-mediated AXIN1 suppression. Accordingly, RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate an ER-dependent correlation between RUNX1 and AXIN1 in tumour biopsies. RUNX1 loss in ER(+) mammary epithelial cells increases β-catenin, deregulates mitosis and stimulates cell proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. However, it does not stimulate LEF/TCF, c-Myc or CCND1, and it does not accelerate G1/S cell cycle phase transition. Finally, RUNX1 loss-mediated deregulation of β-catenin and mitosis is ameliorated by AXIN1 stabilization in vitro, highlighting AXIN1 as a potential target for the management of ER(+) breast cancer.((PMID:26706127))AML1-ETO is the most common fusion oncoprotein causing acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 24%. AML1-ETO functions as a rogue transcription factor, altering the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation. Currently, there are no specific therapies for AML1-ETO-positive AML. While known for decades to be the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22), it is not known how AML1-ETO achieves its native and functional conformation or whether this process can be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Here, we show that the biosynthesis and folding of the AML1-ETO protein is facilitated by interaction with the essential eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT). We demonstrate that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO binds to TRiC directly, mainly through its β-strand rich, DNA-binding domain (AML-(1-175)), with the assistance of HSP70. Our results suggest that TRiC contributes to AML1-ETO proteostasis through specific interactions between the oncoprotein's DNA-binding domain, which may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.((PMID:26674644))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1-Evi-1 is a chimeric gene generated by the t (3; 21) (q26; q22) translocation, which leads into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by unclear mechanisms. This in vivo study aimed to establish a stable line of zebrafish expressing the human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene under the control of a heat stress-inducible bidirectional promoter, and investigate its roles in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies.We introduced human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter to establish Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. Two males and one female mosaic F0 zebrafish embryos (2.1%) were identified as stable positive germline transgenic zebrafish.The population of immature myeloid cells and hematopoietic blast cells were accumulated in peripheral blood and single cell suspension from kidney of adult Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. RUNX1-Evi-1 presented an intensive influence on hematopoietic regulatory factors. Consequently, primitive hematopoiesis was enhanced by upregulation of gata2 and scl, while erythropoiesis was downregulated due to the suppression of gata1. Early stage of myelopoiesis was flourishing with the high expression of pu.1, but it was inhibited along with the low expression of mpo. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RUNX1-Evi-1 not only upregulated proteasome, cell cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tyrosine metabolism, drug metabolism, and PPAR pathway, but also suppressed transforming growth factor β, Jak-STAT, DNA replication, mismatch repair, p53 pathway, JNK signaling pathway, and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 4 was significantly up-regulated. Factors in cell proliferation were obviously suppressed after 3-day treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid. Accordingly, higher proportion of G1 arrest and apoptosis were manifested by the propidium iodide staining.RUNX1-Evi-1 may promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance of primitive hematopoietic cell, and inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells with the synergy of different pathways and factors. VPA may be a promising choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-Evi-1-related leukemia.((PMID:26580584))Two distantly located promoter regions regulate the dynamic expression of RUNX genes during development: distal P1 and proximal P2 promoters. We have recently described that β-catenin increases total Runx1 mRNA levels in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors and enhances spatial proximity with its translocation partner ETO. Here, we report that induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HL60 and Jurkat leukemia-derived cell lines and CD34(+) progenitors selectively activate the production of the longer distal P1-Runx1 mRNA isoform. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that the differential increase in P1-Runx1 expression is accomplished through a minimal β-catenin responsive region that includes a highly conserved TCF/LEF-binding element, located -20/-16 bp upstream of the canonical distal P1-Runx1 transcription start site. We conclude that the distal P1-Runx1 promoter is a direct transcriptional target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that may be important in normal hematopoiesis or its transition into malignant stem cells during the onset or progression of leukemia.((PMID:26418744))The generation of diverse neuronal subtypes involves specification of neural progenitors and, subsequently, postmitotic neuronal differentiation, a relatively poorly understood process. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of Cbfb but not Runx1 prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of Runx1 in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for Cbfb expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification.((PMID:26397705))The t(8;21) and Inv(16) translocations disrupt the normal function of core binding factors alpha (CBFA) and beta (CBFB), respectively. These translocations represent two of the most common genomic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, occurring in approximately 25% pediatric and 15% of adult with this malignancy. Both translocations are associated with favorable clinical outcomes after intensive chemotherapy, and given the perceived mechanistic similarities, patients with these translocations are frequently referred to as having CBF-AML. It remains uncertain as to whether, collectively, these translocations are mechanistically the same or impact different pathways in subtle ways that have both biological and clinical significance. Therefore, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the similarities and differences in genes and pathways between these subtypes of pediatric AMLs. Diagnostic RNA from patients with t(8;21) (N = 17), Inv(16) (N = 14), and normal karyotype (NK, N = 33) were subjected to RNA-seq. Analyses compared the transcriptomes across these three cytogenetic subtypes, using the NK cohort as the control. A total of 1291 genes in t(8;21) and 474 genes in Inv(16) were differentially expressed relative to the NK controls, with 198 genes differentially expressed in both subtypes. The majority of these genes (175/198; binomial test p-value < 10(-30)) are consistent in expression changes among the two subtypes suggesting the expression profiles are more similar between the CBF cohorts than in the NK cohort. Our analysis also revealed alternative splicing events (ASEs) differentially expressed across subtypes, with 337 t(8;21)-specific and 407 Inv(16)-specific ASEs detected, the majority of which were acetylated proteins (p = 1.5 x 10(-51) and p = 1.8 x 10(-54) for the two subsets). In addition to known fusions, we identified and verified 16 de novo fusions in 43 patients, including three fusions involving NUP98 in six patients. Clustering of differentially expressed genes indicated that the homeobox (HOX) gene family, including two transcription factors (MEIS1 and NKX2-3) were down-regulated in CBF compared to NK samples. This finding supports existing data that the dysregulation of HOX genes play a central role in biology CBF-AML hematopoiesis. These data provide comprehensive transcriptome profiling of CBF-AML and delineate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed, providing insights into the shared biology as well as differences in the two CBF subsets.((PMID:26333776))Chromosomal translocations are frequently associated with a wide variety of cancers, particularly hematologic malignancies. A recurrent chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia is the reciprocal translocation t(8;21) that fuses RUNX1 and ETO genes. We report here that Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases the expression of ETO and RUNX1 genes in human hematopoietic progenitors. We found that β-catenin is rapidly recruited into RNA polymerase II transcription factories (RNAPII-Ser5) and that ETO and RUNX1 genes are brought into close spatial proximity upon Wnt3a induction. Notably, long-term treatment of cells with Wnt3a induces the generation a frequent RUNX1-ETO translocation event. Thus, Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces transcription and translocation of RUNX1 and ETO fusion gene partners, opening a novel window to understand the onset/development of leukemia.((PMID:26254341))Th-inducing Pox virus and zinc finger/Krüppel-like factor (ThPOK) is a key commitment factor for CD4(+) lineage T cells and is essential for the maintenance of CD4 lineage integrity; thus, the expression of ThPOK has to be tightly controlled. In this article, we demonstrate that Myc-associated zinc finger-related factor (MAZR) and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) together repressed ThPOK in preselection double-positive thymocytes, whereas MAZR acted in synergy with Runx3 in the repression of ThPOK in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, MAZR-Runx1 and MAZR-Runx3 double-mutant mice showed enhanced derepression of Cd4 in double-negative thymocytes and in CD8(+) T cells in comparison with Runx1 or Runx3 single-deficient mice, respectively, indicating that MAZR modulates Cd4 silencing. Thus, our data demonstrate developmental stage-specific synergistic activities between MAZR and Runx/core-binding factor β (CBFβ) complexes. Finally, retroviral Cre-mediated conditional deletion of MAZR in peripheral CD8(+) T cells led to the derepression of ThPOK, thus showing that MAZR is also part of the molecular machinery that maintains a repressed state of ThPOK in CD8(+) T cells.((PMID:26091714))Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in tumor-associated immunosuppression, thus affecting effective immunotherapies for cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the differentiation and function of MDSCs remain largely unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of microRNA (miR)-9 promoted the differentiation of MDSCs with significantly reduced immunosuppressive function whereas overexpression of miR-9 markedly enhanced the function of MDSCs. Notably, knockdown of miR-9 significantly impaired the activity of MDSCs and inhibited the tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. Moreover, miR-9 regulated MDSCs differentiation by targeting the runt-related transcription factor 1, an essential transcription factor in regulating MDSC differentiation and function. Furthermore, the CREB was found to regulate miR-9 expression in MDSCs. Taken together, our findings have identified a critical role of miR-9 in regulating the differentiation and function of MDSCs.((PMID:26019273))Proper regulation of microbial-induced cytokines is critical to intestinal immune homeostasis. Acute stimulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), the Crohn's disease-associated sensor of bacterial peptidoglycan, induces cytokines. However, chronic NOD2 stimulation in macrophages decreases cytokines upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) restimulation; cytokine attenuation to PRR stimulation is similarly observed in intestinal macrophages. The role for the transcriptional repressors Twist1 and Twist2 in regulating PRR-induced cytokine outcomes is poorly understood and has not been reported for NOD2. We found that Twist1 and Twist2 were required for optimal cytokine downregulation during acute and, particularly, chronic NOD2 stimulation of human macrophages. Consistently, Twist1 and Twist2 expression was increased after chronic NOD2 stimulation; this increased expression was IL-10 and TGF-β dependent. Although Twist1 and Twist2 did not coregulate each other's expression, they cooperated to enhance binding to cytokine promoters after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Moreover, Twist1 and Twist2 contributed to enhance expression and promoter binding of the proinflammatory inhibitor c-Maf and the transcriptional repressor Bmi1. Restoring c-Maf and Bmi1 expression in Twist-deficient macrophages restored NOD2-induced cytokine downregulation. Furthermore, with chronic NOD2 stimulation, Twist1 and Twist2 contributed to the decreased expression and cytokine promoter binding of the transcriptional activators activating transcription factor 4, C/EBPα, Runx1, and Runx2. Knockdown of these transcriptional activators in Twist-deficient macrophages restored cytokine downregulation after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Finally, NOD2 synergized with additional PRRs to increase Twist1 and Twist2 expression and Twist-dependent pathways. Therefore, after chronic NOD2 stimulation Twist1 and Twist2 coordinate the regulation of both transcriptional activators and repressors, thereby mediating optimal cytokine downregulation.((PMID:26001080))Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is a group of secondary and organized lymphoid tissue that develops at different mucosal surfaces. Peyer's patches (PPs), nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and tear duct-associated lymphoid tissue (TALT) are representative MALT in the small intestine, nasal cavity, and lacrimal sac, respectively. A recent study has shown that transcriptional regulators of core binding factor (Cbf) β2 and promotor-1-transcribed Runt-related transcription factor 1 (P1-Runx1) are required for the differentiation of CD3-CD4+CD45+ lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, which initiate and trigger the developmental program of PPs, but the involvement of this pathway in NALT and TALT development remains to be elucidated. Here we report that Cbfβ2 plays an essential role in NALT and TALT development by regulating LTi cell trafficking to the NALT and TALT anlagens. Cbfβ2 was expressed in LTi cells in all three types of MALT examined. Indeed, similar to the previous finding for PPs, we found that Cbfβ2-/- mice lacked NALT and TALT lymphoid structures. However, in contrast to PPs, NALT and TALT developed normally in the absence of P1-Runx1 or other Runx family members such as Runx2 and Runx3. LTi cells for NALT and TALT differentiated normally but did not accumulate in the respective lymphoid tissue anlagens in Cbfβ2-/- mice. These findings demonstrate that Cbfβ2 is a central regulator of the MALT developmental program, but the dependency of Runx proteins on the lymphoid tissue development would differ among PPs, NALT, and TALT.((PMID:25994056))Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation can be used to identify transcriptional enhancers, but no systematic approach has been developed for genome-wide identification and analysis of enhancers based on DNA methylation. We describe ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), an R-based tool that uses DNA methylation to identify enhancers and correlates enhancer state with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional targets. Transcription factor motif analysis of enhancers is coupled with expression analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators. Using ELMER, we investigated more than 2,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identified networks regulated by known cancer drivers such as GATA3 and FOXA1 (breast cancer), SOX17 and FOXA2 (endometrial cancer), and NFE2L2, SOX2, and TP63 (squamous cell lung cancer). We also identified novel networks with prognostic associations, including RUNX1 in kidney cancer. We propose ELMER as a powerful new paradigm for understanding the cis-regulatory interface between cancer-associated transcription factors and their functional target genes.((PMID:25893288))The t(12;21) translocation is the most common genetic rearrangement in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and gives rise to the TEL-AML1 fusion gene. Many studies on TEL-AML1 describe specific properties of the fusion protein, but a thorough understanding of its function is lacking. We exploited a pluripotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line, EML1, and generated a cell line (EML-TA) stably expressing the TEL-AML1 fusion protein. EML1 cells differentiate to mature B-cells following treatment with IL7; whereas EML-TA display an impaired differentiation capacity and remain blocked at an early stage of maturation. Global gene expression profiling of EML1 cells at different stages of B-lymphoid differentiation, compared with EML-TA, identified the interferon (IFN)α/β pathway as a primary target of repression by TEL-AML1. In particular, expression and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was decreased in EML-TA cells; strikingly, stable expression of IRF3 restored the capacity of EML-TA cells to differentiate into mature B-cells. Similarly, IRF3 silencing in EML1 cells by siRNA was sufficient to block B-lymphoid differentiation. The ability of TEL-AML1 to block B-cell differentiation and downregulate the IRF3-IFNα/β pathway was confirmed in mouse and human primary hematopoietic precursor cells (Lin- and CD34+ cells, respectively), and in a patient-derived cell line expressing TEL-AML1 (REH). Furthermore, treatment of TEL-AML1 expressing cells with IFNα/β was sufficient to overcome the maturation block. Our data provide new insight on TEL-AML1 function and may offer a new therapeutic opportunity for B-ALL.((PMID:25840971))Transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for normal hematopoiesis. High mutation frequencies of RUNX1 gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been described, whereas the biologic significances of the mutations were not investigated. Here, we aimed to correlate the biologic activities of the RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes of patients.We examined the mutational status of RUNX1 in 143 MDS and 84 CMML patients. Then, we studied the DNA and CBFβ binding abilities of all the RUNX1 mutants identified by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, and also determined their activities on target C-FMS gene induction by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Using luciferase reporter assay, the relative biologic activities of each RUNX1 mutant could be quantified and correlated with the patient outcomes by statistical analyses.We observed that most RUNX1 mutants had reduced abilities in DNA binding, CBFβ heterodimerization, and C-FMS gene induction. The relative biologic activities of RUNX1 mutants were grouped into high- and low-activity mutations. Correlation of the activities of RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes revealed that patients harboring lower activities of RUNX1 mutants had a higher risk and shorter time to secondary acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS and CMML. In multivariate analysis, low RUNX1 activity remained an independent predictor for secondary acute myeloid leukemia-free survival in MDS patients.The biologic activity rather than the mutational status of RUNX1 might be an indicator in predicting outcome of patients with MDS and CMML.((PMID:25742748))CBFβ-SMMHC (core-binding factor β-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain), the fusion protein generated by the chromosome 16 inversion fusion gene, CBFB-MYH11, is known to initiate leukemogenesis. However, the mechanism through which CBFβ-SMMHC contributes to leukemia development is not well understood. Previously, it was proposed that CBFβ-SMMHC acts by dominantly repressing the transcription factor RUNX1 (Runt-related protein 1), but we recently showed that CBFβ-SMMHC has activities that are independent of RUNX1 repression. In addition, we showed that a modified CBFβ-SMMHC with decreased RUNX1-binding activity accelerates leukemogenesis. These results raise questions about the importance of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis by CBFβ-SMMHC. To test this, we generated mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 in a Runx1-deficient background, resulting from either homozygous Runx1-null alleles (Runx1(-/-)) or a single dominant-negative Runx1 allele (Runx1(+/lz)). We found that loss of Runx1 activity rescued the differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11 during primitive hematopoiesis. During definitive hematopoiesis, RUNX1 loss also significantly reduced the proliferation and differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11. Importantly, Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemia had much longer latency in Runx1(+/lz) mice than in Runx1-sufficient mice. These data indicate that Runx1 activity is critical for Cbfb-MYH11-induced hematopoietic defects and leukemogenesis.((PMID:25678665))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of adult leukemia. The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16)(p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML. Current inv(16) AML treatment with nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a good initial response but limited long-term survival. Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFβ-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1. AI-10-49 restores RUNX1 transcriptional activity, displays favorable pharmacokinetics, and delays leukemia progression in mice. Treatment of primary inv(16) AML patient blasts with AI-10-49 triggers selective cell death. These data suggest that direct inhibition of the oncogenic CBFβ-SMMHC fusion protein may be an effective therapeutic approach for inv(16) AML, and they provide support for transcription factor targeted therapy in other cancers.((PMID:25605286))Differentiated CD4(+) T cells preserve plasticity under various conditions. However, the stability of Th1 cells is unclear, as is whether Th1 cells can convert into Th17 cells and thereby contribute to the generation of IFN-γ(+) IL-17(+) CD4(+) T cells, the number of which correlates with severity of colitis. We investigated whether IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells can convert into Th17 cells under intestinal inflammation and the mechanisms involved. IFN-γ(Thy1.1+) Th1 cells were generated by culturing naïve CD4(+) T cells from IFN-γ(Thy1.1) CBir1 TCR-Tg reporter mice, whose TCR is specific for an immunodominant microbiota antigen, CBir1 flagellin, under Th1 polarizing conditions. IFN-γ(Thy1.1+) Th1 cells induced colitis in Rag(-/-) mice after adoptive transfer and converted into IL-17(+) Th17, but not Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the inflamed intestines. TGF-β and IL-6, but not IL-1β and IL-23, regulated Th1 conversion into Th17 cells. TGF-β induction of transcriptional factor Runx1 is crucial for the conversion, since silencing Runx1 by siRNA inhibited Th1 conversion into Th17 cells. Furthermore, TGF-β enhanced histone H3K9 acetylation but inhibited H3K9 trimethylation of Runx1- and ROR-γt-binding sites on il-17 or rorc gene in Th1 cells. We conclude that Th1 cells convert into Th17 cells under inflammatory conditions in intestines, which is possibly mediated by TGF-β induction of Runx1.((PMID:25083921))Cooperative assemblies of transcription factors (TFs) on target gene enhancers coordinate cell proliferation, fate specification, and differentiation through precise and complicated transcriptional mechanisms. Chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, of TFs induced by cell signaling further modulate the dynamic cooperativity of TFs. In this study, we found that various Ets1-containing TF-DNA complexes respond differently to calcium-induced phosphorylation of Ets1, which is known to inhibit Ets1-DNA binding. Crystallographic analysis of a complex comprising Ets1, Runx1, and CBFβ at the TCRα enhancer revealed that Ets1 acquires robust binding stability in the Runx1 and DNA-complexed state, via allosteric mechanisms. This allows phosphorylated Ets1 to be retained at the TCRα enhancer with Runx1, in contrast to other Ets1 target gene enhancers including mb-1 and stromelysin-1. This study provides a structure-based model for cell-signaling-dependent regulation of target genes, mediated via chemical modification of TFs.((PMID:25025858))The aim of this research was to investigate the gene expression profile of 4 transcription factors in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) cultured with a xenogeneic bone substitute and a support of machined titanium.In vitro studies were performed on hMSC cells, which grew in contact with cortical porcine bone and machined titanium disks for 10 days. RNA quantification for genes DLX5, CTNNB1, RUNX1, and SP7 was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. For cells supported by titanium, immunocytochemistry of osteocalcin (OC) was also performed.In the osteoblast-induced cells (OIC), DLX5, CTNNB1, and RUNX1 were significantly upregulated (+2.38-, +3.51-, and +7.08-fold, respectively), whereas SP7 was downregulated (-26.32-fold). None of the genes seemed to be upregulated or downregulated by the corticocancellous porcine bone. In cells grown on titanium support, DLX5 and RUNX1 were respectively upregulated (+3.12-fold) and downregulated (-2.14-fold). For titanium support, the presence of both catenin beta-1 and OC was verified.The 2 genes RUNX1 and SP7 resulted differently expressed in cells cultured on metallic supports if compared with the expression recorded for OIC. An induction of the osteogenic phenotype was observed when cells were cultured on machined titanium, but not on xenogeneic material.((PMID:24798493))Core-binding factor β (Cbfβ) is a subunit of the Cbf family of heterodimeric transcription factors, which plays a critical role in skeletal development through its interaction with the Cbfα subunits, also known as Runt-related transcription factors (Runxs). However, the mechanism by which Cbfβ regulates cartilage and bone development remains unclear. Existing Cbfβ-deficient mouse models cannot specify the role of Cbfβ in skeletal cell lineage. Herein, we sought to specifically address the role of Cbfβ in cartilage and bone development by using a conditional knockout (CKO) approach. A mesenchymal-specific Cbfβ CKO mouse model was generated by using the Dermo1-Cre mouse line to specifically delete Cbfβ in mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Surprisingly, the mutant mice had under-developed larynx and tracheal cartilage, causing alveolus defects that led to death shortly after birth from suffocation. Also, the mutant mice exhibited severe skeletal deformities from defective intramembranous and endochondral ossification, owing to delayed chondrocyte maturation and impaired osteoblast differentiation. Almost all bones of the mutant mice, including the calvariae, vertebrae, tibiae, femurs, ribs, limbs and sternums were defective. Importantly, we showed that Cbfβ was expressed throughout the skeleton during both embryonic and postnatal development, which explains the multiple-skeletal defects observed in the mutant mice. Consistently, Cbfβ deficiency impaired both chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy zone hypertrophy during growth-plate development in the long bones of mutant mice. Notably, Cbfβ, Runx1 and Runx2 displayed different expression patterns in the growth plates of the wild-type mice, indicating that Cbfβ/Runx1 complex and Cbfβ/Runx2 complex may regulate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, respectively, in a spatial and temporal manner. Cbfβ deletion in the mesenchymal progenitors affected bone development by dramatically down-regulating Collagen X (Col X) and Osterix (Osx) but had a dispensable effect on osteoclast development. Collectively, the results demonstrate that Cbfβ mediates cartilage and bone development by interacting with Runx1 and Runx2 to regulate the expressions of Col X and Osx for chondrocyte and osteoblast development. These findings not only reveal a critical role for Cbfβ in cartilage and bone development but also facilitate the design of novel therapeutic approaches for skeletal diseases.((PMID:27176614))Core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor complex composed of a DNA-binding subunit, one of three runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) factors, and a non-DNA binding subunit, CBFβ. CBFβ is critical for DNA binding and stability of the CBF transcription factor complex. In the ovary, the LH surge increases the expression of Runx1 and Runx2 in periovulatory follicles, implicating a role for CBFs in the periovulatory process. The present study investigated the functional significance of CBFs (RUNX1/CBFβ and RUNX2/CBFβ) in the ovary by examining the ovarian phenotype of granulosa cell-specific CBFβ knockdown mice; CBFβ f/f * Cyp19 cre. The mutant female mice exhibited significant reductions in fertility, with smaller litter sizes, decreased progesterone during gestation, and fewer cumulus oocyte complexes collected after an induced superovulation. RNA sequencing and transcriptome assembly revealed altered expression of more than 200 mRNA transcripts in the granulosa cells of Cbfb knockdown mice after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation in vitro. Among the affected transcripts are known regulators of ovulation and luteinization including Sfrp4, Sgk1, Lhcgr, Prlr, Wnt4, and Edn2 as well as many genes not yet characterized in the ovary. Cbfβ knockdown mice also exhibited decreased expression of key genes within the corpora lutea and morphological changes in the ovarian structure, including the presence of large antral follicles well into the luteal phase. Overall, these data suggest a role for CBFs as significant regulators of gene expression, ovulatory processes, and luteal development in the ovary.((PMID:26058470))Core binding factor β (Cbfβ) is a partner protein of Runx family transcription factors with minimally characterized function in cartilage. Here we address the role of Cbfβ in cartilage by generating chondrocyte-specific Cbfβ-deficient mice (Cbfb(Δch/Δch) ) from Cbfb-floxed mice crossed with mice expressing Cre from the Col2a1 promoter. Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice died soon after birth and exhibited delayed endochondral bone formation, shorter appendicular skeleton length with increased proliferative chondrocytes, and nearly absent hypertrophic chondrocyte zones. Immunohistochemical and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the number and size of proliferative chondrocytes increased and the expression of chondrocyte maturation markers at the growth plates, including Runx2, osterix, and osteopontin, significantly diminished in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice compared to wild type mice. With regard to signaling pathways, both PTHrP-Ihh and BMP signaling were compromised in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice. Mechanistically, Cbfβ deficiency in chondrocytes caused a decrease of protein levels of Runx transcription factors by accelerating polyubiquitination-mediated proteosomal degradation in vitro. Indeed, Runx2 and Runx3, but not Runx1, decreased in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that Cbfβ plays a critical role for chondrocyte differentiation through stabilizing Runx2 and Runx3 proteins in cartilage.((PMID:25262822))Runx family proteins, Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3, play important roles in skeletal development. Runx2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, and haplodeficiency of RUNX2 causes cleidocranial dysplasia, which is characterized by open fontanelles and sutures and hypoplastic clavicles. Cbfb forms a heterodimer with Runx family proteins and enhances their DNA-binding capacity. Cbfb-deficient (Cbfb(-/-) ) mice die at midgestation because of the lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis. We previously reported that the partial rescue of hematopoiesis in Cbfb(-/-) mice revealed the requirement of Cbfb in skeletal development. However, the precise functions of Cbfb in skeletal development still remain to be clarified. We deleted Cbfb in mesenchymal cells giving rise to both chondrocyte and osteoblast lineages by mating Cbfb(fl/fl) mice with Dermo1 Cre knock-in mice. Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) mice showed dwarfism, both intramembranous and endochondral ossifications were retarded, and chondrocyte maturation and proliferation and osteoblast differentiation were inhibited. The differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts were severely inhibited in vitro, and the reporter activities of Ihh, Col10a1, and Bglap2 promoter constructs were reduced in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) chondrocytes or osteoblasts. The proteins of Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3 were reduced in the cartilaginous limb skeletons and calvariae of Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) embryos compared with the respective protein in the respective tissue of Cbfb(fl/fl) embryos at E15.5, although the reduction of Runx2 protein in calvariae was much milder than that in cartilaginous limb skeletons. All of the Runx family proteins were severely reduced in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) primary osteoblasts, and Runx2 protein was less stable in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) osteoblasts than Cbfb(fl/fl) osteoblasts. These findings indicate that Cbfb is required for skeletal development by regulating chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation and osteoblast differentiation; that Cbfb plays an important role in the stabilization of Runx family proteins; and that Runx2 protein stability is less dependent on Cbfb in calvariae than in cartilaginous limb skeletons.((PMID:24319172))The genetics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are becoming well understood and the incidence of individual chromosomal abnormalities varies considerably with age. Cytogenetics provide reliable risk stratification for treatment: high hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 are good risk, whereas BCR-ABL1, MLL rearrangements, and hypodiploidy are poor risk. Nevertheless, some patients within the good- and intermediate-risk groups will unpredictably relapse. With advancing technologies in array-based approaches (single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) and next-generation sequencing to study the genome, increasing numbers of new genetic changes are being discovered. These include deletions of B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes, as well as mutations of genes in key signaling pathways. Their associations and interactions with established cytogenetic subgroups and with each other are becoming elucidated. Whether they have a link to outcome is the most important factor for refinement of risk factors in relation to clinical trials. For several newly identified abnormalities, including intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21), that are associated with a poor prognosis with standard therapy, appropriately modified treatment has significantly improved outcome. After the successful use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with alternative ABL1 translocations and rearrangements involving PDGFRB may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Other aberrations, for example, CRLF2 overexpression and JAK2 mutations, are also providing potential novel therapeutic targets with the prospect of reduced toxicity.((PMID:23979164))RUNX1 is generally considered a tumor suppressor in myeloid neoplasms. Inactivating RUNX1 mutations have frequently been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no somatic RUNX1 alteration was found in AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia and MLL fusion leukemia, raising the possibility that RUNX1 could actually promote the growth of these leukemia cells. Using normal human cord blood cells and those expressing leukemogenic fusion proteins, we discovered a dual role of RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. RUNX1 overexpression inhibited the growth of normal cord blood cells by inducing myeloid differentiation, whereas a certain level of RUNX1 activity was required for the growth of AML1-ETO and MLL-AF9 cells. Using a mouse genetic model, we also showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited leukemia development induced by MLL-AF9. RUNX2 could compensate for the loss of RUNX1. The survival effect of RUNX1 was mediated by BCL2 in MLL fusion leukemia. Our study unveiled an unexpected prosurvival role for RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. Inhibiting RUNX1 activity rather than enhancing it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins.((PMID:23772668))The 8;21 translocation is the most common chromosomal aberration occurring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This translocation causes expression of the RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO) fusion protein, which cooperates with additional mutations in leukemia development. We report here that interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes are a group of genes consistently up-regulated by RUNX1-ETO in both human and murine models. RUNX1-ETO-induced up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes occurs primarily via type I IFN signaling with a requirement for the IFNAR complex. Addition of exogenous IFN in vitro significantly reduces the increase in self-renewal potential induced by both RUNX1-ETO and its leukemogenic splicing isoform RUNX1-ETO9a. Finally, loss of type I IFN signaling via knockout of Ifnar1 significantly accelerates leukemogenesis in a t(8;21) murine model. This demonstrates the role of increased IFN signaling as an important factor inhibiting t(8;21) fusion protein function and leukemia development and supports the use of type I IFNs in the treatment of AML.((PMID:23713453))Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) is a downstream effector of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and its dysregulation is associated with a number of malignant diseases such as leukemia. We explored the expression profile of LEF1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determined its specific prognostic significance in this disease. The LEF1 mRNA level in patients with previously untreated AML was significantly higher than in normal controls. Patients with AML with relatively higher LEF1 expression were more likely to achieve a complete remission (CR) following induction therapy in comparison to those with a lower LEF1 level. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that primary AML samples with AML1-ETO or PML-RARα have a higher LEF1 level compared with those without each fusion gene. High LEF1 expression predicts a significantly better overall survival for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. High LEF1 level was associated with a favorable relapse-free survival in patients with FLT3-ITD wild-type. Finally, a scoring system based on LEF1 level and mutation status of FLT3-ITD or NPM1 is reliable to predict the outcome for AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Our results indicate that LEF1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AML and could serve as a novel predictor of better treatment response. LEF1 level may be incorporated into an improved risk classification system for certain specific subtypes of AML.((PMID:23672350))No consecutive analysis of BAALC and WT1 expressions associated with core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML) from diagnosis to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has yet been reported. We investigated BAALC and WT1 expressions using a method of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) at diagnosis, after induction chemotherapy, at pre-HSCT, and at post-HSCT period in 45 consecutive patients [t(8,21) (n = 28), inv(16) (n = 17)], who received HSCT as a post-remission treatment. BAALC and WT1 RQ-PCR decrement ratio (DR) was also calculated at post-induction chemotherapy, at pre-HSCT, and at post-HSCT compared with the diagnostic level. Higher BAALC expression at diagnosis showed significantly inferior OS (P = 0.031), EFS (P = 0.011), and higher CIR (P = 0.002) rates. At post-HSCT, both higher BAALC and WT1 expressions showed significantly inferior OS (P = 0.005, 0.016), EFS (P = 0.002, 0.006), and higher CIR (P = 0.001, 0.003) rates. A subgroup of t(8;21) showing higher BAALC and WT1 expressions at post-HSCT were also associated with inferior OS (P = 0.018, 0.015) and higher CIR rates (P = 0.019, 0.011). While BAALC DR showed no significant results on outcomes, WT1 DR more than 2-log at post-HSCT showed significantly lower CIR rate (P = 0.028). This study showed that higher post-HSCT BAALC and WT1 expressions in patients with CBF-AML may be good markers of minimal residual disease for the prediction of survival and relapse after HSCT.((PMID:23645839))Developing novel therapies that suppress self-renewal of leukemia stem cells may reduce the likelihood of relapses and extend long-term survival of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML1-ETO (AE) is an oncogene that plays an important role in inducing self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), leading to the development of leukemia stem cells. Previously, using a zebrafish model of AE and a whole-organism chemical suppressor screen, we have discovered that AE induces specific hematopoietic phenotypes in embryonic zebrafish through a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and β-catenin-dependent pathway. Here, we show that AE also induces expression of the Cox-2 gene and activates β-catenin in mouse bone marrow cells. Inhibition of COX suppresses β-catenin activation and serial replating of AE(+) mouse HSPCs. Genetic knockdown of β-catenin also abrogates the clonogenic growth of AE(+) mouse HSPCs and human leukemia cells. In addition, treatment with nimesulide, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, dramatically suppresses xenograft tumor formation and inhibits in vivo progression of human leukemia cells. In summary, our data indicate an important role of a COX/β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway in tumor initiation, growth, and self-renewal, and in providing the rationale for testing potential benefits from common COX inhibitors as a part of AML treatments.((PMID:23179400))It is known that leukemia patients with extramedullary infiltration (EMI) have a worse prognosis than patients without it. Recent data indicate that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation. The expression of APP and its prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been studied. Our study shows that AML/ETO(+) leukemia patients that overexpress APP easily get EMI and that their long-term survival rate is lower than patients without overexpression of APP. In an in vitro study, we knocked down APP in Kasumi-1 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Transwell data show that siRNA/APP substantially impairs cell migration, but it does not inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, we found that siRNA/APP decreases MMP-2 expression in vitro. Our study provides a novel clue that APP is involved in the extramedullary infiltration of leukemia by MMP-2.((PMID:22031861))Secreted-frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) are modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway that is closely involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Epigenetic deregulation of Wnt modulators leading to aberrant signaling has been reported in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its occurrence in childhood patients with AML and the role of individual modulators are unclear. In this study, we examined SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, and SFRP5 promoter methylation in 83 patients with AML (59 children and 24 adults) and found preferential SFRP1 methylation and mRNA down-regulation in the prognostically favorable subgroup of AML with t(8;21) translocation. Among the 4 genes, SFRP1 methylation independently predicted prolonged event-free and relapse-free survivals in childhood patients with nonacute promyelocytic leukemia with nonadverse cytogenetics. Mechanistically, we further demonstrated that RUNX1-ETO, the t(8;21) fusion product, specifically bound the SFRP1 promoter and repressed its transcription via a consensus RUNX binding site. In t(8;21)-leukemia cells, SFRP1 selectively inhibited canonical Wnt signaling and cellular proliferation that were associated with concomitant down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, including CCND1 and MYC. Taken together, we identified SFRP1 as a transcriptional repression target of the t(8;21) fusion protein and demonstrated a novel mechanism of Wnt activation in a specific subtype of AML.((PMID:22012064))The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) H3K4 methyltransferase protein, and the heterodimeric RUNX1/CBFβ transcription factor complex, are critical for definitive and adult hematopoiesis, and both are frequently targeted in human acute leukemia. We identified a physical and functional interaction between RUNX1 (AML1) and MLL and show that both are required to maintain the histone lysine 4 trimethyl mark (H3K4me3) at 2 critical regulatory regions of the AML1 target gene PU.1. Similar to CBFβ, we show that MLL binds to AML1 abrogating its proteasome-dependent degradation. Furthermore, a subset of previously uncharacterized frame-shift and missense mutations at the N terminus of AML1, found in MDS and AML patients, impairs its interaction with MLL, resulting in loss of the H3K4me3 mark within PU.1 regulatory regions, and decreased PU.1 expression. The interaction between MLL and AML1 provides a mechanism for the sequence-specific binding of MLL to DNA, and identifies RUNX1 target genes as potential effectors of MLL function.((PMID:21051318))The genetic origins of the development of malignant haematological disorders have been established at the beginning of the 80ies. Systematic characterization of chromosomal structural abnormalities and, more recently by DNA microarray approaches and sequencing of tumour genomes have allowed the identification of a large number of genes that are mutated during malignant transformation in humans. Functional studies of these human oncogenes have shown that most of them were not able to transform a haematologic progenitor when acting alone and that cooperation with other oncogenic events was required. The present challenges are the evaluation of the role of each mutation in malignant transformation and the definition of the chronology of their emergence. From these data, the development of efficient therapeutic approaches will be possible by targeting the early oncogenic events which are at the origin of the malignant transformation.((PMID:20688956))Among mutations in human Runx1/AML1 transcription factors, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) genomic translocation that creates an AML1-ETO fusion protein is implicated in etiology of the acute myeloid leukemia. To identify genes and components associated with this oncogene we used Drosophila as a genetic model. Expression of AML1-ETO caused an expansion of hematopoietic precursors in Drosophila, which expressed high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mutations in functional domains of the fusion protein suppress the proliferative phenotype. In a genetic screen, we found that inactivation of EcRB1 or activation of Foxo and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) suppress the AML1-ETO-induced phenotype by reducing ROS expression in the precursor cells. Our studies indicate that ROS is a signaling factor promoting maintenance of normal as well as the aberrant myeloid precursors and suggests the importance of antioxidant enzymes and their regulators as targets for further study in the context of leukemia.((PMID:20395424))((PMID:20339092))The transcription factor NF-E2 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Concomitantly, 95% of these patients carry the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Although NF-E2 levels correlate with JAK2(V671F) allele burden in some PV cohorts, the molecular mechanism causing aberrant NF-E2 expression has not been described. Here we show that NF-E2 expression is also increased in patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis independent of the presence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Characterization of the NF-E2 promoter revealed multiple functional binding sites for AML1/RUNX-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter in vivo. Moreover, AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter was significantly increased in granulocytes from PV patients compared with healthy controls. AML1 mRNA expression was elevated in patients with PV, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis both in the presence and absence of JAK2(V617F). In addition, AML1 and NF-E2 expression were highly correlated. RNAi-mediated suppression of either AML1 or of its binding partner CBF-beta significantly decreased NF-E2 expression. Moreover, expression of the leukemic fusion protein AML/ETO drastically decreased NF-E2 protein levels. Our data identify NF-E2 as a novel AML1 target gene and delineate a role for aberrant AML1 expression in mediating elevated NF-E2 expression in MPN patients.((PMID:20008176))All cancers evolve by a process of genetic diversification and "natural selection" akin to the process first described by Charles Darwin for species evolution. The evolutionary, natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is almost entirely covert, clinically silent and well advanced by the point of diagnosis. It has, however, been possible to backtrack this process by molecular scrutiny of appropriate clinical samples: (i) leukemic clones in monozygotic twins that are either concordant or discordant for ALL; (ii) archived neonatal blood spots or Guthrie cards from individuals who later developed leukemia; and (iii) stored, viable cord blood cells. These studies indicate prenatal initiation of leukemia by chromosome translocation and gene fusion (or hyperdiploidy) and the post-natal acquisition of multiple, gene copy number alterations (CNAs), mostly deletions. The prenatal or first "hit" occurs very commonly, exceeding the clinical rate of ALL by some 100x and indicating a low rate of penetrance or evolutionary progression. The acquisition of the critical, secondary CNAs requires some Darwinian selective advantage to expand numbers of cells at risk, and the cytokine TGF beta is able to exercise this function. The clonal architecture of ALL has been investigated by single cell analysis with multicolor probes to mutant genes. The data reveal not a linear sequence of mutation acquisition with clonal succession but rather considerable complexity with a tree-like or branching structure of genetically distinct subclones very reminiscent of Darwin's original 1837 evolutionary divergence diagram. This evolutionary pattern has important implications for stem cells in ALL, for the origins of relapse and for therapeutic targeting.((PMID:19901261))Early relapse detection in acute myeloid leukemia is possible using standardized real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) protocols. However, optimal sampling intervals have not been defined and are likely to vary according to the underlying molecular lesion. In 74 patients experiencing hematologic relapse and harboring aberrations amenable to RQ-PCR (mutated NPM1 [designated NPM1c], PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11), we observed strikingly different relapse kinetics. The median doubling time of the CBFB-MYH11 leukemic clone was significantly longer (36 days) than that of clones harboring other markers (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 14 days; PML-RARA, 12 days; and NPM1c, 11 days; P < .001). Furthermore, we used a mathematical model to determine frequency of relapse detection and median time from detection of minimal residual disease to hematologic relapse as a function of sampling interval length. For example, to obtain a relapse detection fraction of 90% and a median time of 60 days, blood sampling every sixth month should be performed for CBFB-MYH11 leukemias. By contrast, in NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(-), NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(+), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and PML-RARA leukemias, bone marrow sampling is necessary every sixth, fourth, and fourth and second month, respectively. These data carry important implications for the development of optimal RQ-PCR monitoring schedules suitable for evaluation of minimal residual disease-directed therapies in future clinical trials.((PMID:19893343))Cytogenetic abnormalities are one of the most reliable prognostic factors in acute leukemia. Combination of conventional chromosome analysis (CCA) and FISH provides higher sensitivity in detecting these genetic abnormalities, and it is effective to apply several FISH probes as a profile test. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of FISH profile analyses in the initial diagnosis of acute leukemia.Two hundred and forty one de novo acute leukemia patients diagnosed from January, 2002 to November, 2007 were included. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia profile test, FISH probes for BCR/ABL, TEL/AML1, MLL gene rearrangement and CDKN2A deletion were used. For acute myeloid leukemia profile test, probes for AML1/ETO, MLL and CBFbeta gene rearrangement were used. The results of CCA and FISH profile tests were collected, and the positive rates were compared.ALL FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic aberrations not detected by chromosome analysis in 48.6% (67/138) of cases, including those with normal karyotypes or no mitotic cells (37%, 51/138). Among these 51 cases, TEL/AML1 abnormalities were detected in 44.3%, followed by the abnormal CDKN2A signal (24.6%) and hyperdiploidy (18.0%). AML FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic abnormalities in 7.8% (8/103) of cases.FISH analysis as a profile test detected additional genetic aberrations in a significant proportion of acute leukemia, and was effective especially in detecting cryptic translocations, submicroscopic deletions and complex karyotypes. Our study supports the need to incorporate FISH profile test at initial work up in acute leukemia.((PMID:19800266))Naturally arising regulatory T (Treg) cells express the transcription factor FoxP3, which critically controls the development and function of Treg cells. FoxP3 interacts with another transcription factor Runx1 (also known as AML1). Here, we showed that Treg cell-specific deficiency of Cbfbeta, a cofactor for all Runx proteins, or that of Runx1, but not Runx3, induced lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and hyperproduction of IgE. Cbfb-deleted Treg cells exhibited impaired suppressive function in vitro and in vivo, with altered gene expression profiles including attenuated expression of FoxP3 and high expression of interleukin-4. The Runx complex bound to more than 3000 gene loci in Treg cells, including the Foxp3 regulatory regions and the Il4 silencer. In addition, knockdown of RUNX1 showed that RUNX1 is required for the optimal regulation of FoxP3 expression in human T cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the Runx1-Cbfbeta heterodimer is indispensable for in vivo Treg cell function, in particular, suppressive activity and optimal expression of FoxP3.((PMID:19779050))((PMID:25612891))Core Binding Factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) with t(8;21) RUNX1-MTG8 or inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins often show upregulation of wild type or mutated KIT receptor. However, also non-CBF-AML frequently displays upregulated KIT expression. In the first part of this study we show that KIT expression can be also upregulated by miR-17, a regulator of RUNX1, the gene encoding a CBF subunit. Interestingly, both CBF leukemia fusion proteins and miR-17, which targets RUNX1-3'UTR, negatively affect a common core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism that forces myeloid cells into an undifferentiated, KIT-induced, proliferating state. In the second part of this study we took advantage of the conservation of the core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism in mouse and human, to mechanistically demonstrate in a mouse myeloid cell model that increased KIT-induced proliferation is per se a mechanism sufficient to delay myeloid differentiation.Human (U937) or mouse (32D) myeloid clonal lines were used, respectively, to test: 1) the effect of RUNX1-MTG8 and CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins, or upregulation of miR-17, on KIT-induced proliferation and myeloid differentiation, and 2) the effect of upregulation of KIT-induced proliferation per se on myeloid cell differentiation.In the first part of this study we found that stable miR-17 upregulation affects, like the CBF-AML fusion proteins (RUNX1-MTG8 or CBFB-MYH11), a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism leading to KIT-induced proliferation of differentiation-arrested U937 myeloid cells. In the second part of the study we harnessed the conservation of this core mechanism in human and mouse to demonstrate that the extent of KIT upregulation in 32D mouse myeloid cells with wild type RUNX1 can per se delay G-CSF-induced differentiation. The integrated information gathered from the two myeloid cell models shows that RUNX1 regulates myeloid differentiation not only by direct transcriptional regulation of coding and non-coding myeloid differentiation functions (e.g. miR-223), but also by modulating KIT-induced proliferation via non-coding miRNAs (e.g. miR-221).The novelty of this study is dual. On the one hand, miRNAs (e.g. miR-17) can mimic the effects of CBF-AML fusion proteins by affecting a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism of KIT-induced proliferation of undifferentiated myeloid cells. On the other hand, the extent of KIT-induced proliferation itself can modulate myeloid differentiation of cells with wild type RUNX1 function.((PMID:25480496))((PMID:24850758))CBFβ and RUNX1 form a DNA-binding heterodimer and are both required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) generation in mice. However, the exact role of CBFβ in the production of HSCs remains unclear. Here, we generated and characterized 2 zebrafish cbfb null mutants. The cbfb(-/-) embryos underwent primitive hematopoiesis and developed transient erythromyeloid progenitors, but they lacked definitive hematopoiesis. Unlike runx1 mutants, in which HSCs are not formed, nascent, runx1(+)/c-myb(+) HSCs were formed in cbfb(-/-) embryos. However, the nascent HSCs were not released from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, as evidenced by the accumulation of runx1(+) cells in the AGM that could not enter circulation. Moreover, wild-type embryos treated with an inhibitor of RUNX1-CBFβ interaction, Ro5-3335, phenocopied the hematopoietic defects in cbfb(-/-) mutants, rather than those in runx1(-/-) mutants. Finally, we found that cbfb was downstream of the Notch pathway during HSC development. Our data suggest that runx1 and cbfb are required at 2 different steps during early HSC development. CBFβ is not required for nascent HSC emergence but is required for the release of HSCs from AGM into circulation. Our results also indicate that RUNX1 can drive the emergence of nascent HSCs in the AGM without its heterodimeric partner CBFβ.((PMID:24677539))Runx1 and Cbfβ are critical for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and are implicated in leukemic transformation. Despite the absolute requirements for these factors in the development of hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes, their roles in the development of bone marrow progenitor subsets have not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that Cbfβ is essential for the development of Flt3(+) macrophage-dendritic cell (DC) progenitors in the bone marrow and all DC subsets in the periphery. Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression of Irf8 restors DC differentiation. These results demonstrate that Runx proteins and Cbfβ restrict granulocyte lineage commitment to facilitate multilineage hematopoietic differentiation and thus identify their novel tumor suppressor function in myeloid leukemia.((PMID:24449215))RUNX1/CBFβ (core binding factor [CBF]) is a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations, point mutations, or deletions in acute leukemia. The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is also frequently involved in chromosomal translocations or partial tandem duplication in acute leukemia. The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. RUNX1/CBFβ recruits MLL to regulate downstream target genes. However, the functional consequence of MLL fusions on RUNX1/CBFβ activity has not been fully understood. In this report, we show that MLL fusion proteins and the N-terminal MLL portion of MLL fusions downregulate RUNX1 and CBFβ protein expression via the MLL CXXC domain and flanking regions. We confirmed this finding in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice and human M4/M5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, with or without MLL translocations, showing that MLL translocations cause a hypomorph phenotype of RUNX1/CBFβ. Overexpression of RUNX1 inhibits the development of AML in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice; conversely, further reducing Runx1/Cbfβ levels accelerates MLL-AF9-mediated AML in bone marrow transplantation assays. These data reveal a newly defined negative regulation of RUNX1/CBFβ by MLL fusion proteins and suggest that targeting RUNX1/CBFβ levels may be a potential therapy for MLLs.((PMID:24402281))The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protein Vif has a central role in the neutralization of host innate defences by hijacking cellular proteasomal degradation pathways to subvert the antiviral activity of host restriction factors; however, the underlying mechanism by which Vif achieves this remains unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of the Vif-CBF-β-CUL5-ELOB-ELOC complex. The structure reveals that Vif, by means of two domains, organizes formation of the pentameric complex by interacting with CBF-β, CUL5 and ELOC. The larger domain (α/β domain) of Vif binds to the same side of CBF-β as RUNX1, indicating that Vif and RUNX1 are exclusive for CBF-β binding. Interactions of the smaller domain (α-domain) of Vif with ELOC and CUL5 are cooperative and mimic those of SOCS2 with the latter two proteins. A unique zinc-finger motif of Vif, which is located between the two Vif domains, makes no contacts with the other proteins but stabilizes the conformation of the α-domain, which may be important for Vif-CUL5 interaction. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for Vif hijacking of the CBF-β and CUL5 E3 ligase complex, laying a foundation for rational design of novel anti-HIV drugs.((PMID:24002588))Different mechanisms for CBFβ-MYH11 function in acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) have been proposed such as tethering of RUNX1 outside the nucleus, interference with transcription factor complex assembly and recruitment of histone deacetylases, all resulting in transcriptional repression of RUNX1 target genes. Here, through genome-wide CBFβ-MYH11-binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics, we found that CBFβ-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters, where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the coregulators EP300 and HDAC1. Transcriptional analysis revealed that upon fusion protein knockdown, a small subset of the CBFβ-MYH11 target genes show increased expression, confirming a role in transcriptional repression. However, the majority of CBFβ-MYH11 target genes, including genes implicated in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal such as ID1, LMO1 and JAG1, are actively transcribed and repressed upon fusion protein knockdown. Together these results suggest an essential role for CBFβ-MYH11 in regulating the expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell phenotype.((PMID:23877199))The rare but recurrent RUNX1-USP42 fusion gene is the result of a t(7;21)(p22;q22) chromosomal translocation and has been described in 6 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and one case of refractory anemia with excess of blast. In the present study, we present the molecular genetic analysis and the clinical features of a t(7;21)(p22;q22)-positive AML case. PCR amplified two RUNX1-USP42 cDNA fragments but no reciprocal USP42-RUNX1 fragment indicating that the RUNX1-USP42 is the leukemogenic fusion gene. Sequencing of the two amplified fragments showed that exon 6 or exon 7 of RUNX1 (accession number NM_001754 version 3) was fused to exon 3 of USP42 (accession number NM_032172 version 2). The predicted RUNX1-USP42 fusion protein would contain the Runt homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for heterodimerization with CBFB and for DNA binding, and the catalytic UCH (ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydroxylase) domain of the USP42 protein. The bone marrow cells in the present case also had a 5q deletion, and it was revealed that 5 out of the 8 reported cases (including the present case) with t(7;21)(p22;q22)/RUNX1-USP42 also had cytogenetic abnormalities of 5q. The fact that t(7;21) and 5q- occur together much more often than chance would allow seems to be unquestionable, although the pathogenetic connection between the two aberrations remains unknown.((PMID:23646898))Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and genetic rearrangements involving the core binding factor (CBF) have favorable prognosis. In contrast, a minority of them still have a high risk of leukemia recurrence. This study investigated the adverse features of CBF AML that could justify investigational therapeutic approaches.One hundred and fifty patients (median age 42 yr, range 16-69) with CBF AML (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 n = 74; CBFB-MYH11 n = 76) were prospectively enrolled into two consecutive CETLAM protocols at 19 Spanish institutions. Main clinic and biologic parameters were analyzed in the whole series. In non-selected cases with available DNA samples, the impact of molecular characterization and minimal residual disease (MRD) was also studied.Overall, complete remission (CR) rate was 89% (94% in ≤50 yr old and 72% in >50 yr, P = 0.002). At 5 yr, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 26 ± 1%, disease-free survival (DFS) 62 ± 6%, and overall survival (OS) 66 ± 4%. In multivariate analyses, leukocyte count above 20 × 10(9) /L, BAALC over-expression, and high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy (CT) led to increased relapse rate. Regarding OS, age >50 yr, leukocyte count above 20 × 10(9) /L, and increased MN1 expression were adverse features.Age, leukocyte counts, BAALC, and MN1 gene expressions as well as high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy are useful tools to predict the outcome and should be considered for risk-adapted therapy.((PMID:23053179))Core binding factor (CBF)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents a favorable prognosis, except for patients with KIT mutation, especially D816 mutation. The current retrospective study attempted to validate a prognostic role of KIT mutation in 121 Korean patients with CBF AML. The study patients consisted of 121 patients with CBF AML (82 patients with RUNX1/RUNX1T1 [67.8 %] and 39 patients with CBFB/MYH11 [32.2 %]) recruited from eight institutions in Korea. All patients received idarubicin plus cytarabine or behenoyl cytosine arabinoside 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy. The KIT gene mutation status was determined by direct sequencing analyses. A KIT mutation was detected in 32 cases (26.4 %) in our series of patients. The KIT mutation was most frequent in exon 17 (n = 18, 14.9 %; n = 16 with D816 mutation), followed by exon 8 (n = 10, 8.3 %). The presence of KIT D816 mutation was associated with adverse outcomes for the event-free survival (p = 0.03) and for the overall survival (p = 0.02). The unfavorable impact of D816 mutation was more prominent when the analysis was confined to the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 subtype. The KIT mutation was detected in 26.4 % of Korean patients with CBF AML. The KIT D816 mutation demonstrated an unfavorable prognostic implication, particularly in the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 subtype.((PMID:22912405))Core binding factor (CBF) leukemias, those with translocations or inversions that affect transcription factor genes RUNX1 or CBFB, account for ~24% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 25% of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Current treatments for CBF leukemias are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 5-y survival rate of ~50%. We hypothesize that the interaction between RUNX1 and CBFβ is critical for CBF leukemia and can be targeted for drug development. We developed high-throughput AlphaScreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) methods to quantify the RUNX1-CBFβ interaction and screen a library collection of 243,398 compounds. Ro5-3335, a benzodiazepine identified from the screen, was able to interact with RUNX1 and CBFβ directly, repress RUNX1/CBFB-dependent transactivation in reporter assays, and repress runx1-dependent hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. Ro5-3335 preferentially killed human CBF leukemia cell lines, rescued preleukemic phenotype in a RUNX1-ETO transgenic zebrafish, and reduced leukemia burden in a mouse CBFB-MYH11 leukemia model. Our data thus confirmed that RUNX1-CBFβ interaction can be targeted for leukemia treatment and we have identified a promising lead compound for this purpose.((PMID:22875911))The clinical value of serial minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by quantitative RT-PCR was prospectively assessed in 278 patients [163 with t(8;21) and 115 with inv(16)] entered in the United Kingdom MRC AML 15 trial. CBF transcripts were normalized to 10(5) ABL copies. At remission, after course 1 induction chemotherapy, a > 3 log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts in BM in t(8;21) patients and a > 10 CBFB-MYH11 copy number in peripheral blood (PB) in inv(16) patients were the most useful prognostic variables for relapse risk on multivariate analysis. MRD levels after consolidation (course 3) were also informative. During follow-up, cut-off MRD thresholds in BM and PB associated with a 100% relapse rate were identified: for t(8;21) patients BM > 500 copies, PB > 100 copies; for inv(16) patients, BM > 50 copies and PB > 10 copies. Rising MRD levels on serial monitoring accurately predicted hematologic relapse. During follow-up, PB sampling was equally informative as BM for MRD detection. We conclude that MRD monitoring by quantitative RT-PCR at specific time points in CBF AML allows identification of patients at high risk of relapse and could now be incorporated in clinical trials to evaluate the role of risk directed/preemptive therapy.((PMID:22722202))Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2008 alone. This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.((PMID:22491093))Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that involves the destruction of articular cartilage and eventually leads to disability. Molecules that promote the selective differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes may stimulate the repair of damaged cartilage. Using an image-based high-throughput screen, we identified the small molecule kartogenin, which promotes chondrocyte differentiation (median effective concentration = 100 nM), shows chondroprotective effects in vitro, and is efficacious in two OA animal models. Kartogenin binds filamin A, disrupts its interaction with the transcription factor core-binding factor β subunit (CBFβ), and induces chondrogenesis by regulating the CBFβ-RUNX1 transcriptional program. This work provides new insights into the control of chondrogenesis that may ultimately lead to a stem cell-based therapy for osteoarthritis.((PMID:22325351))Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play key roles in developmental epigenetic regulation. Yet the mechanisms that target PRCs to specific loci in mammalian cells remain incompletely understood. In this study we show that Bmi1, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), binds directly to the Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex. Genome-wide studies in megakaryocytic cells demonstrate significant chromatin occupancy overlap between the PRC1 core component Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ and functional regulation of a considerable fraction of commonly bound genes. Bmi1/Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ deficiencies generate partial phenocopies of one another in vivo. We also show that Ring1b occupies key Runx1 binding sites in primary murine thymocytes and that this occurs via PRC2-independent mechanisms. Genetic depletion of Runx1 results in reduced Ring1b binding at these sites in vivo. These findings provide evidence for site-specific PRC1 chromatin recruitment by core binding transcription factors in mammalian cells.((PMID:27667292))Fluorescence in situ hybridization examination of a pediatric AML patient whose bone marrow cells carried trisomy 4 and FLT3-ITD mutation, demonstrated that part of the RUNX1 probe had unexpectedly moved to chromosome band 6q25 indicating a cryptic t(6;21)(q25;q22) translocation. RNA sequencing showed fusion of exon 7 of RUNX1 with an intergenic sequence of 6q25 close to the MIR1202 locus, something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. The RUNX1 fusion transcript encodes a truncated protein containing the Runt homology domain responsible for both heterodimerization with CBFB and DNA binding, but lacking the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PST) region which is the transcription activation domain at the C terminal end. Which genetic event (+4, FLT3-ITD, t(6;21)-RUNX1 truncation or other, undetected acquired changes) was more pathogenetically important in the present case of AML, remains unknown. The case illustrates that submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements may accompany visible numerical changes and perhaps should be actively looked for whenever a single trisomy is found. An active search for them may provide both pathogenetic and prognostic novel information.((PMID:27632978))The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system defines recurrent chromosomal translocations as the sole diagnostic and prognostic criteria for acute leukemia (AL). These fusion transcripts are pivotal in the pathogenesis of AL. Clinical laboratories universally employ conventional karyotype/FISH to detect these chromosomal translocations, which is complex, labour intensive and lacks multiplexing capacity. Hence, it is imperative to explore and evaluate some newer automated, cost-efficient multiplexed technologies to accommodate the expanding genetic landscape in AL."nCounter® Leukemia fusion gene expression assay" by NanoString was employed to detect various fusion transcripts in a large set samples (n = 94) utilizing RNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) diagnostic bone marrow biopsy specimens. This series included AL patients with various recurrent translocations (n = 49), normal karyotype (n = 19), or complex karyotype (n = 21), as well as normal bone marrow samples (n = 5). Fusion gene expression data were compared with results obtained by conventional karyotype and FISH technology to determine sensitivity/specificity, as well as positive /negative predictive values.Junction probes for PML/RARA; RUNX1-RUNX1T1; BCR/ABL1 showed 100 % sensitivity/specificity. A high degree of correlation was noted for MLL/AF4 (85 sensitivity/100 specificity) and TCF3-PBX1 (75 % sensitivity/100 % specificity) probes. CBFB-MYH11 fusion probes showed moderate sensitivity (57 %) but high specificity (100 %). ETV6/RUNX1 displayed discordance between fusion transcript assay and FISH results as well as rare non-specific binding in AL samples with normal or complex cytogenetics.Our study presents preliminary data with high correlation between fusion transcript detection by a throughput automated multiplexed platform, compared to conventional karyotype/FISH technique for detection of chromosomal translocations in AL patients. Our preliminary observations, mandates further vast validation studies to explore automated molecular platforms in diagnostic pathology.((PMID:27512765))The identification of minimal residual disease (MRD) has led to substantial improvements in early recognition of the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Flow cytometry (FC), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization are useful methods for the detection of MRD in AML patients although molecular monitoring of leukemia-specific rearranged (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11) or mutated genetic (NPM1, CEBPA) sequences represents the most sensitive methodology. Besides, more than 50% of all AML patients lack one of these specific sequences, so it is crucial to identify molecular targets applicable for the majority of patients. WT1 is overexpressed at the mRNA level in 80–90% of AML cases at diagnosis in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, and is detectable in a consistent low range in normal donors. These features have led to its adoption for MRD detection using RQ-PCR. A European LeukemiaNet Study found the magnitude of WT1 log reduction after induction chemotherapy to be an independent predictor of relapse. Other studies showed a poorer outcome in patients having WT1 levels above reference thresholds at specific time points. WT1 expression was compared with other modalities of MRD assessment, such as RQ-PCR of specific fusion genes and FC, but no differences in terms of predictive value emerged. Finally, some authors translated the use of WT1 in the clinic giving donor lymphocytes infusions to patients with increasing WT1-mRNA levels after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and obtaining an improvement of survival in this subset. Data collected on WT1 expression over the past years provided evidence for the use of this molecular marker to stratify high-risk AML patients. It can also be used as a marker for early interventional therapy, but further studies are needed to demonstrate it.((PMID:27460049))Detection of leukemogenic fusion transcripts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is critical for AML diagnosis. NanoString nCounter system is a novel probe-based gene expression platform capable of measuring up to 800 targets with advantages of reproducibility, accuracy, and sample type flexibility. To study the potential application of NanoString in leukemia at clinic, we used this technology to detect AML leukemogenic fusion transcripts and compared the performances with clinical molecular assays.We developed a NanoString assay to detect seven leukemogenic fusion transcripts, namely RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (e5e12), PML-RARA (bcr1, bcr2, and bcr3), and CBFB-MYH11 (e5e12, e5e8, and e5e7). We set up the cut-off value for each fusion transcript and tested 42 de novo AML samples. We compared the results with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TaqMan reverse quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), the molecular methods standardly used at clinic.We demonstrated that the NanoString and RT-PCR results correlate well (P < 0.0001) and are highly concordant (95.2%). Using TaqMan RQ-PCR as a validation method and gold standard, we demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity of NanoString compared to RT-PCR and comparable specificity. Furthermore, we showed that NanoString is not as sensitive as TaqMan RQ-PCR in detecting very low level of fusion transcripts.NanoString can serve as a reliable and alternative molecular method to multiplexed RT-PCR for diagnosis of de novo AML with the perspective of screening/quantitation of a large number of leukemogenic fusion transcripts and prognostic genes. However, NanoString may not be an alternative method for monitoring minimal residual disease in AML.((PMID:27298396))To examine the value of minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We studied 42 patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and 51 with inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 Tandem MRD analyses by MFC and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed in 281 bone marrow (BM) samples.Grouping qRT-PCR levels as ≤0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10, and >10%, and reporting MFC (sensitivity, 0.1%-0.01%) as positive or negative, κ coefficient test showed no agreement between qRT-PCR and MFC in BM samples obtained postinduction (n = 44, κ = 0.041), and only weak agreement during consolidation (n = 108, κ = 0.083), maintenance/follow-up (n = 107, κ = 0.164), and salvage chemotherapy (n = 24, 0.376). In the post induction BM samples, while qRT-PCR <0.1% was associated with lower and ≥10% with higher AML relapse risk (P = .035), qRT-PCR between 0.1% to 1% and 1% to 10% failed to predict relapse. In the latter group with intermediate qRT-PCR results, MFC provided prognostic value for relapse (P = 0.006).MFC and qRT-PCR are complementary tests in monitoring CBF AML MRD.((PMID:27022003))Cytogenetic analyses of a consecutive series of 67 paediatric (median age 8 years; range 0-17) de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients revealed aberrations in 55 (82%) cases. The most common subgroups were KMT2A rearrangement (29%), normal karyotype (15%), RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (10%), deletions of 5q, 7q and/or 17p (9%), myeloid leukaemia associated with Down syndrome (7%), PML-RARA (7%) and CBFB-MYH11 (5%). Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analysis and exon sequencing of 100 genes, performed in 52 and 40 cases, respectively (39 overlapping), revealed ≥1 aberration in 89%; when adding cytogenetic data, this frequency increased to 98%. Uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs) were detected in 13% and copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 63% (median 2/case); three UPIDs and 22 CNAs were recurrent. Twenty-two genes were targeted by focal CNAs, including AEBP2 and PHF6 deletions and genes involved in AML-associated gene fusions. Deep sequencing identified mutations in 65% of cases (median 1/case). In total, 60 mutations were found in 30 genes, primarily those encoding signalling proteins (47%), transcription factors (25%), or epigenetic modifiers (13%). Twelve genes (BCOR, CEBPA, FLT3, GATA1, KIT, KRAS, NOTCH1, NPM1, NRAS, PTPN11, SMC3 and TP53) were recurrently mutated. We conclude that SNP-A and deep sequencing analyses complement the cytogenetic diagnosis of paediatric AML.((PMID:26890219))Cbfb is a cotranscription factor that forms a heterodimer with Runx proteins Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3. It is required for fetal liver hematopoiesis and skeletal development. Cbfb has two functional isoforms, Cbfb1 and Cbfb2, which are formed by alternative splicing. To address the biological functions of these isoforms in skeletal development, we examined Cbfb1(-/-) and Cbfb2(-/-) mouse embryos. Intramembranous and endochondral ossification was retarded and chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation was inhibited in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos but not in Cbfb1(-/-) embryos. Cbfb2 mRNA was upregulated in calvariae, limbs, livers, thymuses, and hearts of Cbfb1(-/-) embryos but Cbfb1 mRNA was not in those of Cbfb2(-/-) embryos, and the total amount of Cbfb1 and Cbfb2 mRNA in Cbfb1(-/-) embryos was similar to that in wild-type embryos but was severely reduced in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos. The absolute numbers of Cbfb2 mRNA in calvariae, limbs, livers, thymuses, and brains in wild-type embryos were about three times higher than those of Cbfb1 in the respective tissue. The levels of Runx proteins were reduced in calvariae, limbs, and primary osteoblasts from Cbfb2(-/-) embryos, but the reduction in Runx2 protein was very mild. Furthermore, the amounts of Runx proteins and Cbfb in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos differed similarly among skeletal tissues, livers, and thymuses, suggesting that Runx proteins and Cbfb are mutually required for their stability. Although Cbfb1(-/-) embryos developed normally, Cbfb1 induced chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and enhanced DNA binding of Runx2 more efficiently than Cbfb2. Our results indicate that modulations in the relative levels of the isoforms may adjust transcriptional activation by Runx2 to appropriate physiological levels. Cbfb2 was more abundant, but Cbfb1 was more potent for enhancing Runx2 activity. Although only Cbfb2 loss generated overt skeletal phenotypes, both may play major roles in skeletal development with functional redundancy. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.((PMID:26165235))RUNX1 and CBFB are among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukemias. Genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations, copy number variations and point mutations have been widely reported to result in the malfunction of RUNX transcription factors. Leukemias arising from such alterations in RUNX family genes are collectively termed core binding factor (CBF) leukemias. Although adult CBF leukemias generally are considered a favorable risk group as compared with other forms of acute myeloid leukemia, the 5-year survival rate remains low. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanism for CBF leukemia is imperative to uncover novel treatment options. Over the years, retroviral transduction-transplantation assays and transgenic, knockin and knockout mouse models alone or in combination with mutagenesis have been used to study the roles of RUNX alterations in leukemogenesis. Although successful in inducing leukemia, the existing assays and models possess many inherent limitations. A CBF leukemia model which induces leukemia with complete penetrance and short latency would be ideal as a platform for drug discovery. Here, we summarize the currently available mouse models which have been utilized to study CBF leukemias, discuss the advantages and limitations of individual experimental systems, and propose suggestions for improvements of mouse models.((PMID:25732229))In a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following therapy, finding ≥5% bone marrow (BM) blasts is highly concerning for residual/relapsed disease. Over an 18-month period, we performed multicolor flow cytometry immunophenotyping (MFC) for AML minimal residual disease on >4,000 BM samples, and identified 41 patients who had ≥5% myeloblasts by morphology but negative by MFC. At the time of a negative MFC study, an abnormal cytogenetic study converted to negative in 14 patients and remained positive at a low level (2.5-9.5%) by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 3 (14%), of the latter, abnormalities subsequently disappeared in the repeated BM in 2 patients. Positive pretreatment mutations, including FLT3, NPM1, IDH1, CEBPA, became negative in all 10 patients tested. Of the seven patients with favorable cytogenetics, PML/RARA, CBFB-MYH11 or RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts were detected at various levels in six patients but all patients remained in complete remission. With no additional chemotherapy given, 39 patients had BM repeated (median 2 weeks, range <1-21), and all cases showed <5% BM blasts and a continuously negative MFC. In the end of follow-up (median 10 months, range 1-22), 13 patients experienced relapse, 12/13 showing clonal cytogenetic evolution/switch and 11 demonstrating major immunophenotypic shifts. We conclude that MFC is useful in identifying a regenerating BM sample with ≥5% BM blasts that would otherwise be scored as positive using standard morphologic examination. We believe this conclusion is supported by the changes in molecular cytogenetic status and the patient clinical follow-up data.((PMID:25715404))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia is a favorable acute myeloid leukemia subset cytogenetically defined by t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16) rearrangements, disrupting RUNX1 (previously CBFA/AML1) or CBFB transcription factor functions. The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is expressed in the vast majority of these acute myeloid leukemias and frequent activating KIT gene mutations have been associated with a higher risk of relapse. This phase II study aimed to evaluate dasatinib as maintenance therapy in patients with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia in first hematologic complete remission, but at higher risk of relapse due to molecular disease persistence or recurrence. A total of 26 patients aged 18-60 years old previously included in the CBF-2006 trial were eligible to receive dasatinib 140 mg daily if they had a poor initial molecular response (n=18) or a molecular recurrence (n=8). The tolerance of dasatinib as maintenance therapy was satisfactory. The 2-year disease-free survival in this high-risk population of patients was 25.7%. All but one patient with molecular recurrence presented subsequent hematologic relapse. Patients with slow initial molecular response had a similar disease-free survival when treated with dasatinib (40.2% at 2 years) or without any maintenance (50.0% at 2 years). The disappearance of KIT gene mutations at relapse suggests that clonal devolution may in part explain the absence of efficacy observed with single-agent dasatinib in these patients (n. EudraCT: 2006-006555-12).((PMID:25635758))In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) and/or the corresponding molecular rearrangements RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and CBFB/MYH11 [collectively referred to as core binding factor (CBF) AML] predict for a more favourable outcome in patients receiving cytarabine-anthracycline based induction and upon achievement of complete remission, high-dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy. However, 40-45% of these patients eventually relapse and die of their disease. Here, we review emerging molecular and therapeutic results that may be used to guide the clinical management of this subset of patients.Integration of cytogenetic results with molecular genetic and epigenetic data refines the diagnosis, classification and risk-stratification of CBF AML. Clinical studies with targeting compounds (e.g. gemtuzumab ozogamicin, dasatinib) added to intensive chemotherapy appear beneficial both in younger and older patients, albeit the latter continue to have a significantly worse outcome than the former. Regularly molecular monitoring of disease during remission may provide a strategy for early therapeutic intervention before overt relapse.Emerging evidence supports that novel diagnostic, treatment and molecular disease monitoring approaches may improve the prognosis of CBF AML.((PMID:25348871))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) - including AML with t(8;21) and AML with inv(16) - accounts for about 15% of adult AML and is associated with a relatively favorable prognosis. Nonetheless, relapse incidence may reach 40% in these patients. In this context, identification of prognostic markers is considered of great interest. Due to similarities between their molecular and prognostic features, t(8;21) and inv(16)-AML are usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies. However, considerable experimental evidences have highlighted that they represent two distinct entities and should be considered separately for further studies. This review summarizes recent laboratory and clinical findings in this particular subset of AML and how they could be used to improve management of patients in routine practice.((PMID:27468869))The diagnostics of leukemia relies upon multi-parametric approach involving a number of different pathology disciplines such as flow cytometry, histopathology, cytogenetics and molecular genetics [fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. Childhood leukemia is often determined by the presence of specific chromosomal translocation that entails the generation of preleukemic fusion genes (PFG). In the last two decades, several studies have reported observations that PFG are present in healthy population and not necessarily result in leukemia. The first such study by Limpens and colleagues on t(14/18)/ BCL2-JH [1] and next in line [2, 3] led to many questions regarding the significance of these chromosomal translocations in leukemogenesis. However, the data on the incidence of PFG are contradictive. This review aims to highlight the molecular genetic approaches used by various studies with regard to differences in diagnostics and incidence of PFG in healthy subjects. The focus is on the incidence and prevalence of the most common PFG such as TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, BCR-ABL (p190), AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11 detected in umbilical cord blood, in neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards (GC)), bone marrow, peripheral blood and tissues of amortized fetuses. We conclude that the incidence of PFG is significantly higher than incidence of leukemia and more sophisticated analysis of PFG in leukemogenic cell populations is warranted to relate the occurrence of PFG with leukemia. The emerging notion is that only those PFG may contribute to development of leukemia which arise in stem cells at specific time windows during development. Thus, screening of PFG in subpopulations of stem cells may be a challenge for assessment of predisposition to leukemia and for validation of cell transplant to minimize donor cell-derived leukemia.((PMID:26299742))In this work, we evaluated the incidence and prognostic value of several genetic aberrations in patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We analysed 90 patients: 42 males (mean age 54.5 years) and 48 females (mean age 59 years), with AML. The genetics of all leukemia samples was studied using conventional cytogenetics, the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation as well as the standardized RTPCR protocol.In 34.4% of patients, we detected at least one of the analysed genetic aberrations, except the CBFB MYH11, which we did not detect. Translocation t(8;21)/ AML1 ETO was found in 4.4% of patients with a mean age of 45.4 years, while none of these patients was older than 55 years. Translocation t(15;17)/ PMLRARA was found in 5.5% of patients with a mean age of 52.6 years and an almost equal distribution between younger and older patients. The MLL gene rearrangements were found in 6.6% of patients, the -5/ 5q- and/ or -7/ 7q- aberrations in 7.7% of patients, while the most frequent genetic abnormality in our study was trisomy 8 (10%). Moreover, we found a favorable clinical outcome in patients expressing fusion genes AML1-ETO or PMLRARA in contrast to an adverse clinical outcome with few remissions and death in AML patients with MLL, -5q/ -5 and -7q/ 7-. Finally, an intermediate prognosis was found in patients with trisomy 8.In this study, we found a good congruence with published literature on the incidence and prognostic value of several well established AML-associated genetic aberrations. This simple genetic-based classification system helps us to identify patients with a favorable, intermediate or unfavorable prognosis and to treat them with the best currently available therapy. However, analysis of new genetically defined abnormalities in AML is necessary for development of better therapeutic strategies and/or diagnostics.((PMID:24602728))To investigate the clinical value of multiplex nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-nPCR) in screening acute myeloid leukemia(AML)fusion genes.A novel multiplex RT-nPCR assay was developed to detect 16 AML-related fusion genes (AML1-EVI1, AML1-ETO, AML1-MDS1, AML1-MTG16, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, MLL-MLL, PML-RARα, PLZFRARα, NPM1-RARα, CBFB-MYH11, DEK-CAN, SET-CAN and TLS-ERG) according to 2008 WHO classification of AML. The chromosome reciprocal translocations of 356 AML cases were detected by multiplex RT-nPCR and karyotyping. The positive samples were further confirmed by split- out PCR and FISH.The fusion genes were detected in 172 patients with the positive detection rate of 48.31%(172/356), which was higher than that of karyotyping (31.46%) (χ²=70.314, P<0.01). Multiplex RT-nPCR is superior to karyotyping and FISH in identifying the rare, cryptic chromosome translocation (χ²=96.074, P<0.01).The multiplex RT-nPCR used in this study can quickly, effectively and accurately screen the fusion genes in AML patients, which can provide important evidence for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and also provide necessary information for minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognosis.((PMID:23257420))Within the past few years, the invention of next-generation sequencing has revealed several new genes associated with tumor formation and development, for example DNMT3a. This gene is an independent prognostic factor for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The objective of this study was to analyze the DNMT3a mutation in childhood AML in a single center. PCR amplification of the entire coding region of DNMT3a was performed using 23 overlapping primer pairs in 57 patients who were diagnosed in Blood Disease Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, then the directly sequencing was underwent. The results showed that no DNMT3a mutation was found in these patients including the hotspot R882. But AML1/ETO mutation was found in 10 patients, CBFB/MYH11 mutation in 3 patients, PML/RARa mutation in 13 patients, FLT3/ITD mutation in 5 patients, FLT3/TKD mutation in 1 patient, PML/RARa and FLT3/TKD mutation coexisted in 2 patients. It is concluded that DNMT3a mutations are rare in childhood AML, and different mechanisms of myeloid leukemogenesis between childhood and adults maybe involved.((PMID:22196957))Despite a high remission rate, a significant number of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Thus, the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML is an important strategy to better identify high risk patients. Most sensitive methodology to detect MRD is molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but its applicability is restricted to AML with leukemia-specific molecular targets (e.g. AML1-ETO, CBFB-MYH11, MLL, FLT-3). In our study, MRD was monitored at different time points with both MFC and WT1-RNA quantification in 23 AML patients who did not present specific molecular targets. As previously published, we considered values of 10(-3) (0.1%) in MFC and 90 WT1-RNA × 10(4) ABL copies as optimal thresholds. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to confirm these data. To realize the methodology that better identify high risk patients, an analysis of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (PV) and likelihood ratio (LR) was provided and similar results were showed. MRD levels ≥ 10(-3) in MFC as well MRD levels ≥ 90 WT1-RNA copies in RQ-PCR, identify risk groups of patients with poor prognosis. Therefore, MFC and WT1-RNA quantification showed a comparable capacity in terms of technical performance and clinical significance to identify high risk patients who eventually relapsed.((PMID:22145956))The KIT D816V mutation is detected in the vast majority of adult cases of systemic mastocytosis (SM). The mutation is also frequently detected in core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF AML) defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1;q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 chromosomal rearrangements, but whether the mutation is indicative of associated SM is unclear. In the present study, patients with CBF AML were therefore analyzed for the KIT D816V mutation and mutation positive cases subsequently analyzed for the presence of SM. The KIT D816V mutation was detected in eight of 20 cases of CBF AML, with the frequency in t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13.1;q22) positive cases being 31% and 57%, respectively. The fraction of KIT D816V mutation positive cells was highly variable among the eight mutation positive patients, with levels ranging from 0.04 to 98% in a pretreatment blood sample. Five of the eight cases carried the mutation in a cell fraction below one-tenth of the blast cell fraction, thus suggesting that KIT mutation is often a late event in leukemogenesis. None of the eight KIT D816V mutation positive cases fulfilled the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria of SM. The presence of the KIT D816V mutation in the CBF AML subgroup can therefore not be considered indicative of associated SM.((PMID:22032582))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cytogenetically defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), commonly abbreviated as t(8;21) and inv(16), respectively. In both subtypes, the cytogenetic rearrangements disrupt genes that encode subunits of core-binding factor, a transcription factor that functions as an essential regulator of normal hematopoiesis. The rearrangements t(8;21) and inv(16) involve the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 ( AML1-ETO ) and CBFB/MYH11 genes, respectively. These 2 subtypes are categorized as AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, and hence the cytogenetic fusion transcripts are considered diagnostic of acute leukemia even when the marrow blast count is less than 20%. The t(8;21) and inv(16) subtypes of AML have been usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies; however, recent studies have demonstrated genetic, clinical, and prognostic differences, supporting the notion that they represent 2 distinct biologic and clinical entities. This review summarizes the spectrum of this subset of AMLs, with particular emphasis on molecular genetics and pathologic findings.((PMID:21354057))Leukemia- and lymphoma-associated (LLA) chromosomal rearrangements are critical in the process of tumorigenesis. These genetic alterations are also important biological markers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of hematopoietic malignant diseases. To detect the presence or absence of these genetic alterations in healthy individuals, sensitive nested RT-PCR analyses were performed on a large number of peripheral blood samples for selected markers including MLL partial tandem duplications (PTDs), BCR-ABL p190, BCR-ABL p210, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11. Using nested RT-PCR, the presence of all of these selected markers was detected in healthy individuals at various prevalence rates. No correlation was observed between incidence and age except for BCR-ABL p210 fusion, the incidence of which rises with increasing age. In addition, nested RT-PCR was performed on a large cohort of umbilical cord blood samples for MLL PTD, BCR-ABL p190 and BCR-ABL p210. The results demonstrated the presence of these aberrations in cord blood from healthy neonates. To our knowledge, the presence of PML-RARA and CBFB-MYH11 in healthy individuals has not been previously described. The present study provides further evidence for the presence of LLA genetic alterations in healthy individuals and suggests that these mutations are not themselves sufficient for malignant transformation.((PMID:21344764))The aim of the paper is to present the initial results of molecular examination which was started in 2006 for children with acute myeloid leukemia. Better knowledge of biology of this disease, can result in establishing of new risk factors what allows more precise patient stratification to different therapeutic groups. Study was obtained patients until to 18 years of age treated according to AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol in 14 centers of the Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. Mononuclear cells were collected from bone marrow on time points established according to the AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol. Collected cells were isolated on Ficoll gradient, and RNA and DNA were isolated using TRIZOL reagent. To synthesize cDNA an amount of 1 mg of total RNA was used. To perform quantitative RT-PCR and RQ-PCR reactions 4 fusion gene transcripts (AML1-ETO, CBFb-MYH11, PML-RARA /subtype bcrl and bcr3/) were used according to the protocol established by Europe Against Cancer Program. An expression of WT1 gene was tested additionally. An analysis of ABL control gene was used to normalize of achieved results. Determination of duplication of FLT3 gene in DNA sample was performed with starters complementary to JM region. Genotyping was performed in 75 patients with acute myeloid leukemia so far. AML1-ETO fusion gene transcript was found in 14 patients (19%). PML-RARA (subtype bcr3) and CBFB-MYH11 gene transcripts were detected in 3 (4%) and 3 (4%) patients, respectively. Duplication of FLT3 gene was found in 4 (5.3%) cases. Between 67 tested children over expression of WT1 was present in 51 patients (76%). Analysis of MRD level in subsequent time points showed systematic decrease of number of fusion gene transcript copies and gene WT1 expression. To establish the rate of molecular marker presence in AML in children and the influence of the presence of MRD on the treatment results as well, the study has to be conducted on a larger group of patients with longer follow-up.((PMID:21198299))Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) accounts for 15 to 25 percent of childhood acute leukemias. The most common genetic abnormalities seen in pediatric AML patients are AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes resulting in t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16). These genetic defects are seen in approximately 20-25% of AML patients.We investigated in this study, incidence and prognostic significance of the AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes in children with AML.The authors analyzed 34 children with AML using the real time-polymerase chain reaction for AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes.Of the patients, 8.8% were positive for t(8;21), 8.8% for t(15;17) and 3% for inv(16). There were a statistically significant differences between 48 month overall survival rates of the patients positive and negative for t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16).It was concluded that t(15;17), t(8;21) and inv(16) impact on disease prognosis positively, but comprehensive studies with larger patient series are now needed for confirmation.((PMID:21123134))Nowadays, the presence of specific genetic aberrations is progressively used for classification and treatment stratification, because acute leukemias with the same oncogenetic aberration generally form a clinically and diagnostically homogenous disease entity with comparable prognosis. Many oncogenetic aberrations in acute leukemias result in a fusion gene, which is transcribed into fusion transcripts and translated into fusion proteins, which are assumed to play a critical role in the oncogenetic process. Fusion gene aberrations are detected by karyotyping, FISH, or RT-PCR analysis. However, these molecular genetic techniques are laborious and time consuming, which is in contrast to flow cytometric techniques. Therefore we developed a flow cytometric immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins in lysates of leukemia cell samples by use of a bead-bound catching antibody against one side of the fusion protein and fluorochrome-conjugated detection antibody. So far, we have been able to design such fusion protein immunobead assays for BCR-ABL, PML-RARA, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11. The immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins can be performed within 3 to 4 hours in a routine diagnostic setting, without the need of special equipment other than a flow cytometer. The novel immunobead assay will enable fast and easy classification of acute leukemia patients that express fusion proteins. Such patients can be included at an early stage in the right treatment protocols, much faster than by use of current molecular techniques. The immunobead assay can be run in parallel to routine immunophenotyping and is particularly attractive for clinical settings without direct access to molecular diagnostics.((PMID:21120205))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis can provide important information in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies. However, FISH performed in addition to G-banded karyotype can be labor-intensive and expensive. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH gives additional information in the setting of adequate conventional cytogenetics in cases of hematologic malignancies.Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from 135 patients at diagnosis (56 AML, 32 MDS, 20 ALL, and 27 MM) between 2005 and 2010. Interphase FISH was performed using the following probes: BCR/ABL1, AML1/ETO, PML/RARA, CBFB, MLL, EGR1, CEP8, and D7S486 for AML; CEP8, D20S108, EGR1, and D7S486 for MDS; BCR/ABL1, MLL, CDKN2A (p16), ETV6, and 6q21/c-myc for ALL; IgH, TP53, D13S25, IgH/CCND1, IgH/MAF, IgH/FGFR3, and 1q21/8p21 for MM. We compared the results of FISH with the corresponding aberrations identified by G-banded karyotype.Additional genetic aberrations detected by FISH (which were not identified by G-banded karyotype) were 4%, 9%, 50%, and 67% in AML, MDS, ALL, and MM, respectively. In ALL, CDKN2A and ETV6 FISH revealed additional genetic aberrations in 33% and 28% of cases, respectively. In MM, FISH was of benefit in detecting IgH, D13S25, TP53, and 1q21 rearrangements, not detected by G-banded karyotype (31%, 36%, 20%, and 40%, respectively).These results suggest that performing FISH in addition to G-banded karyotype may contribute little additional genetic information in AML and MDS, whereas routine FISH analysis appears to be an efficient screening method in ALL and MM.((PMID:20931398))MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are postulated to be important regulators in various cancers, including leukemia. In a large-scale miRNA expression profiling analysis of 435 human miRNAs in 52 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, we found that miR-126 and its minor counterpart in biogenesis, namely, miR-126*, were specifically aberrantly overexpressed in core binding factor (CBF) AMLs including both t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and inv(16)/CBFB-MYH11 samples. Our in vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that forced expression of miR-126 inhibited apoptosis and increased the viability of AML cells, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous expression of miR-126 was knocked down. In addition, through in vitro colony-forming/replating assays, we demonstrated that forced expression of miR-126 enhanced proliferation and colony-forming/replating capacity of mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells alone and particularly, in cooperation with AML1-ETO, a fusion gene resulting from t(8;21). Thus, our data shows that miR-126 may play a critical role in the development of CBF leukemias. In the present chapter, the materials and protocols for the study of miR-126 in leukemia are described.((PMID:20808941))Aberrant promoter DNA methylation has been shown to play a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathophysiology. However, further studies to discuss the prognostic value and the relationship of the epigenetic signatures with defined genomic rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia are required.We carried out high-throughput methylation profiling on 116 de novo AML cases and we validated the significant biomarkers in an independent cohort of 244 AML cases. Methylation signatures were associated with the presence of a specific cytogenetic status. In normal karyotype cases, aberrant methylation of the promoter of DBC1 was validated as a predictor of the disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, DBC1 expression was significantly silenced in the aberrantly methylated samples. Patients with chromosome rearrangements showed distinct methylation signatures. To establish the role of fusion proteins in the epigenetic profiles, 20 additional samples of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced with common fusion genes were studied and compared with patient samples carrying the same rearrangements. The presence of MLL rearrangements in HSPC induced the methylation profile observed in the MLL-positive primary samples. In contrast, fusion genes such as AML1/ETO or CBFB/MYH11 failed to reproduce the epigenetic signature observed in the patients.Our study provides a comprehensive epigenetic profiling of AML, identifies new clinical markers for cases with a normal karyotype, and reveals relevant biological information related to the role of fusion proteins on the methylation signature.((PMID:15156186))Inv(16)(p13q22) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia subtype M4Eo that is characterized by the presence of myelomonocytic blasts and atypical eosinophils. This chromosomal rearrangement results in the fusion of CBFB and MYH11 genes. CBF beta normally interacts with RUNX1 to form a transcriptionally active nuclear complex. The MYH11 gene encodes the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The CBF beta-SMMHC fusion protein is capable of binding to RUNX1 and form dimers and multimers through its myosin tail. Previous results from transgenic mouse models show that Cbfb-MYH11 is able to inhibit dominantly Runx1 function in hematopoiesis, and is a key player in the pathogenesis of leukemia. In recent years, molecular and cellular biological studies have led to the proposal of several models to explain the function of CBF beta-SMMHC. In this review, we will first focus our attention on the molecular mechanisms proposed in the recent publications. We will next examine recent gene expression profiling studies on inv(16) leukemia cells. Finally, we will describe a recent study from one of our labs on the identification of cooperating genes for leukemogenesis with CBFB-MYH11.((PMID:12434152))Core-binding factor beta (CBFbeta, also called polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2beta (PEBP2B)) is associated with an inversion of chromosome 16 and is associated with acute myeloid leukemia in humans. CBFbeta forms a heterodimer with RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1), which has a DNA binding domain homologous to the pair-rule protein runt in Drosophila melanogaster. Both RUNX1 and CBFbeta are essential for hematopoiesis. Haploinsufficiency of another runt-related protein, RUNX2 (also called CBFA1), causes cleidocranial dysplasia in humans and is essential in skeletal development by regulating osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation. Mice deficient in Cbfb (Cbfb(-/-)) die at midgestation, so the function of Cbfbeta in skeletal development has yet to be ascertained. To investigate this issue, we rescued hematopoiesis of Cbfb(-/-) mice by introducing Cbfb using the Gata1 promoter. The rescued Cbfb(-/-) mice recapitulated fetal liver hematopoiesis in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and survived until birth, but showed severely delayed bone formation. Although mesenchymal cells differentiated into immature osteoblasts, intramembranous bones were poorly formed. The maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic cells was markedly delayed, and no endochondral bones were formed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter assays showed that Cbfbeta was necessary for the efficient DNA binding of Runx2 and for Runx2-dependent transcriptional activation. These findings indicate that Cbfbeta is required for the function of Runx2 in skeletal development.((PMID:23997091))AML1/RUNX1 is an essential transcription factor involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. AML1 binds to the Runt-binding double-stranded DNA element (RDE) of target genes through its N-terminal Runt domain. In a previous study, we obtained RNA aptamers against the AML1 Runt domain by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment and revealed that RNA aptamers exhibit higher affinity for the Runt domain than that for RDE and possess the 5'-GCGMGNN-3' and 5'-N'N'CCAC-3' conserved motif (M: A or C; N and N' form Watson-Crick base pairs) that is important for Runt domain binding. In this study, to understand the structural basis of recognition of the Runt domain by the aptamer motif, the solution structure of a 22-mer RNA was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance. The motif contains the AH(+)-C mismatch and base triple and adopts an unusual backbone structure. Structural analysis of the aptamer motif indicated that the aptamer binds to the Runt domain by mimicking the RDE sequence and structure. Our data should enhance the understanding of the structural basis of DNA mimicry by RNA molecules.((PMID:20484411))Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and muscle segment homeobox homolog 2-interacting nuclear target (MINT) (Spen homolog) are transcriptional regulators critical for mammalian development. MINT enhances Runx2 activation of osteocalcin (OC) fibroblast growth factor (FGF) response element in an FGF2-dependent fashion in C3H10T1/2 cells. Although the MINT N-terminal RNA recognition motif domain contributes, the muscle segment homeobox homolog 2-interacting domain is sufficient for Runx2 activation. Intriguingly, Runx1 cannot replace Runx2 in this assay. To better understand this Runx2 signaling cascade, we performed structure-function analysis of the Runx2-MINT trans-activation relationship. Systematic truncation and domain swapping in Runx1:Runx2 chimeras identified that the unique Runx2 activation domain 3 (AD3), encompassed by residues 316-421, conveys MINT+FGF2 trans-activation in transfection assays. Ala mutagenesis of Runx2 Ser/Thr residues identified that S301 and T326 in AD3 are necessary for full MINT+FGF2 trans-activation. Conversely, phosphomimetic Asp substitution of these AD3 Ser/Thr residues enhanced activation by MINT. Adjacent Pro residues implicated regulation by a proline-directed protein kinase (PDPK). Systematic screening with PDPK inhibitors identified that the casein kinase-2/homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HIPK)/dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase inhibitor 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT), but not ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38MAPK, or other casein kinase-2 inhibitors, abrogated Runx2-, MINT-, and FGF2-activation. Systematic small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of DMAT-inhibited PDPKs revealed that HIPK3 depletion reduced MINT+FGF2-dependent activation of Runx2. HIPK3 and Runx2 coprecipitate after in vitro transcription-translation, and recombinant HIPK3 recognizes Runx2 AD3 as kinase substrate. Furthermore, DMAT treatment and HIPK3 RNAi inhibited MINT+FGF2 activation of Runx2 AD3, and nuclear HIPK3 colocalized with MINT. HIPK3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide selectively reduced Runx2 protein accumulation and OC gene expression in C3H10T1/2 cells. Thus, HIPK3 participates in MINT+FGF2 regulation of Runx2 AD3 activity and controls Runx2-dependent OC expression.((PMID:15944284))Expression of the IL-7R alpha-chain (IL-7Ralpha) is strictly regulated during the development and maturation of lymphocytes. Glucocorticoids (GC) have pleiotypic effects on the growth and function of lymphocytes. Although GC have been reported to induce the transcription of IL-7Ralpha gene in human T cells, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we show that GC up-regulate the levels of IL-7Ralpha mRNA and protein in mouse T cells. This effect does not require protein synthesis de novo, because protein synthesis inhibitors do not block the process. Mouse IL-7Ralpha promoter has striking homology with human and rat, containing consensus motifs of Ikaros, PU.1, and Runx1 transcription factors. In addition, a conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) of approximately 270 bp was found 3.6-kb upstream of the promoter, which was designated as CNS-1. A GC receptor (GR) motif is present in the CNS-1 region. Importantly, we show by reporter assay that the IL-7Ralpha promoter has specific transcription activity in T cells. This activity highly depends on the PU.1 motif. Furthermore, GC treatment augments the transcriptional activity through the GR motif in the CNS-1 region. We also demonstrate that GR binds to the GR motif by EMSA. In addition, by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that GR is rapidly recruited to endogenous CNS-1 chromatin after GC stimulation. These results demonstrate that GR binds to the GR motif in the CNS-1 region after GC stimulation and then activates the transcription of the IL-7Ralpha promoter. Thus, this study identifies the IL-7Ralpha CNS-1 region as a GC-responsive element.((PMID:11733147))The RUNX3 gene belongs to the runt domain family of transcription factors that act as master regulators of gene expression in major developmental pathways. In mammals the family includes three genes, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3. Here, we describe a comparative analysis of the human chromosome 1p36.1 encoded RUNX3 and mouse chromosome 4 encoded Runx3 genomic regions. The analysis revealed high similarities between the two genes in the overall size and organization and showed that RUNX3/Runx3 is the smallest in the family, but nevertheless exhibits all the structural elements characterizing the RUNX family. It also revealed that RUNX3/Runx3 bears a high content of the ancient mammalian repeat MIR. Together, these data delineate RUNX3/Runx3 as the evolutionary founder of the mammalian RUNX family. Detailed sequence analysis placed the two genes at a GC-rich H3 isochore with a sharp transition of GC content between the gene sequence and the downstream intergenic region. Two large conserved CpG islands were found within both genes, one around exon 2 and the other at the beginning of exon 6. RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 gene products bind to the same DNA motif, hence their temporal and spatial expression during development should be tightly regulated. Structure/function analysis showed that two promoter regions, designated P1 and P2, regulate RUNX3 expression in a cell type-specific manner. Transfection experiments demonstrated that both promoters were highly active in the GM1500 B-cell line, which endogenously expresses RUNX3, but were inactive in the K562 myeloid cell line, which does not express RUNX3.((PMID:17914110))Selection of novel molecular markers is an important goal of cancer genomics studies. The aim of our analysis was to apply the multivariate bioinformatical tools to rank the genes - potential markers of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) according to their diagnostic usefulness. We also assessed the accuracy of benign/malignant classification, based on gene expression profiling, for PTC. We analyzed a 180-array dataset (90 HG-U95A and 90 HG-U133A oligonucleotide arrays), which included a collection of 57 PTCs, 61 benign thyroid tumors, and 62 apparently normal tissues. Gene selection was carried out by the support vector machines method with bootstrapping, which allowed us 1) ranking the genes that were most important for classification quality and appeared most frequently in the classifiers (bootstrap-based feature ranking, BBFR); 2) ranking the samples, and thus detecting cases that were most difficult to classify (bootstrap-based outlier detection). The accuracy of PTC diagnosis was 98.5% for a 20-gene classifier, its 95% confidence interval (CI) was 95.9-100%, with the lower limit of CI exceeding 95% already for five genes. Only 5 of 180 samples (2.8%) were misclassified in more than 10% of bootstrap iterations. We specified 43 genes which are most suitable as molecular markers of PTC, among them some well-known PTC markers (MET, fibronectin 1, dipeptidylpeptidase 4, or adenosine A1 receptor) and potential new ones (UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, cadherin 16, gap junction protein 3, sushi, nidogen, and EGF-like domains 1, inhibitor of DNA binding 3, RUNX1, leiomodin 1, F-box protein 9, and tripartite motif-containing 58). The highest ranking gene, metallophosphoesterase domain-containing protein 2, achieved 96.7% of the maximum BBFR score.((PMID:27689744))FAXDC2 (fatty acid hydroxylase domain containing 2) is a member of the fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily. Given the important role of fatty acids in megakaryocytes, we have studied the role of this gene in the development of this lineage. Here we show that the expression of FAXDC2 is constantly elevated during megakaryocyte maturation. In contrast, FAXDC2 is significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Moreover, FAXDC2 overexpression promotes the differentiation of megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells, whereas its knockdown disrupts their maturation. Mechanism study shows that FAXDC2 overexpression enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and increases RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1) expression. FAXDC2 also restores megakaryocytic differentiation in cells exposed to an ERK inhibitor or those expressing a dominant negative form of RUNX1. Finally, FAXDC2 overexpression leads to an increase in sphingolipid GM3 synthase, suggesting a potential role of FAXDC2 in lipid metabolism that increases ERK signaling and facilitates megakaryocyte differentiation. Together, these results show that FAXDC2 plays a novel role in development of megakaryocytes and its dysregulation may contribute to abnormal hematopoietic cell development in leukemia.((PMID:27683100))The National Pediatric Oncology Unit (UNOP) is the only pediatric hemato-oncology center in Guatemala.Patients ages 1 to 17 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated according to modified ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (IC-BFM) 2002 protocol. Risk classification was based on age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype, genetics (when available), and early response to therapy.From July 2007 to June 2014, 787 patients were treated, including 160 who had standard-risk ALL, 450 who had intermediate-risk ALL, and 177 who had high-risk ALL. The induction death rate was 6.6%, and the remission rate was 92.9%. The rates of death and treatment abandonment during first complete remission were 4.8% and 2.5%, respectively. At a median observation time of 3.6 years, and with abandonment considered an event, the 5-year event-free survival and overall survival estimates ( ± standard error) were 56.2% ± 2.1% and 64.1% ± 2.1%, respectively, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 28.9% ± 2.0%. Twenty-one of 281 patients (7.5%) investigated were positive for the ets variant 6/runt-related transcription factor 1 (ETV6/RUNX1) fusion.A well organized center in a low-middle-income country can overcome the disadvantages of malnutrition and reduce abandonment. Outcomes remain suboptimal because of late diagnosis, early death, and a high relapse rate, which may have a partly genetic basis. Earlier diagnosis, better management of complications, and better knowledge of ALL will improve outcomes.

Transcripts of muscle-specific kinase (21-fold), acetylcholine receptor subunits α (68-fold), ε (threefold) and γ (47-fold), neural cell adhesion molecule (66-fold), and runt-related transcription factor 1 (33-fold) were upregulated in VO muscle of the rat, consistent with the marked persistent denervation evidenced by a large proportion of very small fibers (>20 %). In the Sarco mice, there were much smaller increases in denervation transcripts (0-3.5-fold) and accumulation of very small fibers (2-6 %) compared to the VO rat, suggesting a reduced capacity for reinnervation in aging muscle. Despite the marked persistent denervation in the VO rat muscle, transcripts of neurotrophins involved in promoting axonal sprouting following denervation exhibited no increase, and several miRNAs predicted to suppress neurotrophins were elevated in VO rat.Our results support the hypothesis that the accumulation of denervated fibers with aging is due to failed reinnervation and that this may be affected by a limited neurotrophin response that mediates axonal sprouting following denervation.((PMID:27573239))An appropriate inflammatory response plays critical roles in eliminating pathogens, whereas an excessive inflammatory response can cause tissue damage. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, plays critical roles in T cells; however, its roles in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammation in macrophages are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that upon TLR4 ligand stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages reduced the expression levels of RUNX1. Silencing of RUNX1 attenuated the LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-6 production levels, but the TNF-α levels were not affected. Overexpression of RUNX1 promoted IL-1β and IL-6 production in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-κB luciferase activity. Importantly, treatment with the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, protected mice from LPS-induced endotoxic shock and substantially reduced the IL-6 levels. These findings suggest that RUNX1 may be a new potential target for resolving TLR4-associated uncontrolled inflammation and preventing sepsis.((PMID:27492765))In our previous studies on the Iranian β-thalassemia (β-thal) patients, we identified an association between the severity of the β-thal phenotype and the polymorphic palindromic site at the 5' hypersensitive site 4-locus control region (5'HS4-LCR) of the β-globin gene cluster. Furthermore, a linkage disequilibrium was observed between this region and XmnI-HBG2 in the patient population. Based on this data, it was suggested that the well-recognized phenotype-ameliorating role assigned to positive XmnI could be associated with its linked elements in the LCR. To investigate the functional significance of polymorphisms at the 5'HS4-LCR, we studied its influence on binding of transcription factors. Web-based predictions of transcription factor binding revealed a binding site for runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), when the allele at the center of the palindrome (TGGGG(A/G)CCCCA) was A but not when it was G. Furthermore, electromobility shift assay (EMSA) presented evidence in support of allele-specific binding of RUNX1 to 5'HS4. Considering that RUNX1 is a well-known regulator of hematopoiesis, these preliminary data suggest the importance of further studies to confirm this interaction and consequently investigate its functional and phenotypical relevance. These studies could help us to understand the molecular mechanism behind the phenotype modifying role of the 5'HS4-LCR polymorphic palindromic region (rs16912979), which has been observed in previous studies.((PMID:27434586))Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs has recently been reported in tumorigenesis and plays a pivotal role in regulating malignant behavior of cancers. In this study, we confirmed that the long noncoding RNAs human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex P5 (HCP5) was up-regulated in glioma tissues as well as in U87 and U251 cells. Knockdown of HCP5 inhibited the malignant biological behavior of glioma cells by reducing proliferation, migration and invasion, and inducing apoptosis. HCP5 regulated the malignant behavior of glioma cells by binding to microRNA-139, which functions as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, knockdown of HCP5 down-regulated Runt-related transcription factor 1, a direct and functional downstream target of microRNA-139 that is involved in microRNA-139-mediated tumor-suppressive effects in glioma cells. Runt-related transcription factor 1 increased promoter activities and upregulated expression of the oncogenic gene astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Runt-related transcription factor 1 also increased the promoter activities and expression of HCP5, which showed a positive feedback loop in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the HCP5-microRNA-139- Runt-related transcription factor 1 feedback loop plays a pivotal role in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells, which may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating glioma.Molecular Therapy (2016); doi:10.1038/mt.2016.103.((PMID:27358895))Chromosomal abnormalities lead to the development of hematologic malignancies such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Known chromosomal changes causing MDS include deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1), and very rarely fusion genes involving RUNX1 at t(5;21)(q15;q22). We present a case of a 71-year-old female with MDS, refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1, with a combination of two cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically a concomitant translocation between chromosomes 5q15 and 21q22 and deletion of chromosome 5q13q33. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for RUNX1 (AML1), localized to 21q22, showed three FISH signals for RUNX1, consistent with rearrangement of RUNX1. Therapy was started with Lenalidomide leading to normal blood counts. Most significantly, repeat cytogenetics revealed normal karyotype and resolution of deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5 and a t(5;21). FISH negative for deletion 5q. The results altogether meet criteria for a complete cytogenetic remission (CR). We report a new case of t(5;21)(q15;q22) involving the RUNX1 gene and del(5)(q13q33) in a MDS patient, a combination of chromosomal abnormalities heretofore not reported in the literature. RUNX1 rearrangement is usually associated with an adverse prognosis in AML and MDS. Deletions of 5q are typically associated with poor prognosis in AML, however it is usually associated with a favorable prognosis in MDS. Our patient responded very well to Lenalidomide therapy with achievement of CR. Lenalidomide is approved for treatment of anemia in low and intermediate risk MDS with del (5q), however based on a search of literature it seems that RUNX1 mutations are also more prominent in patients who have responded to Lenalidomide therapy. MDS is a genomically unstable disease. Hence, it is conceivable that our patient started with a 5q minus syndrome and then acquired the second hit RUNX1 translocation leading to an accelerated phase of myeloid neoplasm or refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1. Hence, the temporal relationship between acquisition of del 5q and RUNX1 rearrangement may have influenced the clinical outcome and possibly response to therapy.((PMID:27358138))Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology. AAA is caused by segmental weakening of the aortic walls and progressive aortic dilation leading to the eventual rupture of the aorta, accompanied by intense inflammation. Additionally, studies have indicated a close relationship between the pathogenesis and progression of AAA and cellular immune responses in aneurysm wall tissue. The Runt-related genes (RUNX) encode multifunctional mediators of the of intracellular signal transduction pathways in vascular remodeling, endothelial function, immune response and inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of RUNX regulatory genes in AAA tissues and to assess the correlations between them. The study was performed on AAA wall-tissue samples obtained from patients with AAA during open aneurysm repair and normal aortic tissues collected from healthy organ donors. There are no proven clinical management strategies or pharmaco-therapeutics to prevent AAA progression once an AAA has been detected. Moreover, so far no biomarkers have been established to indicate the disease status of AAA. Hence, understanding the pathogenesis of AAA has recently become an increasing priority in basic and translational vascular research. We identified significantly higher mRNA and protein level of all of three Runt-related genes in aneurysmal aorta compared to a normal aorta. Increased expression of RUNX2 was demonstrated for the first time in abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue. Additionally, relationships between the activity of RUNX genes in the pathological tissue were identified. The results of elevated expression of RUNX genes and their relationships in the AAA tissues suggest the involvement of conserved Runt-related genes in the pathophysiology of AAA development.((PMID:27288310))Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, characterized by dysregulation of cellular immunity. Th17 and associated IL-17 were involved in the pathogenesis of ITP. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a member of the runt domain-containing family of transcription factors, is required for Th17 differentiation. Whether RUNX1 was involved in the pathogenesis of ITP remains poorly understood. In this study, 30 active ITP patients, 20 ITP in remission and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated to measure mRNA level of RUNX1 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) by quantitative real-time PCR and Th17 cells by flow cytometry. Meanwhile, plasma was extracted for measurement of IL-17 level by ELISA. Our results showed a significantly higher expression of RUNX1, RORγt, Th17 cells and plasma level of IL-17 in active ITP patients than that in healthy controls. No differences of expression of RUNX1, RORγt and Th17 cells were observed between remission patients and controls. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation of RUNX1 with RORγt was found in active ITP patients. In conclusion, RUNX1 was associated with the pathogenesis of ITP possibly through regulation of Th17 cell differentiation and therapeutically targeting it might be a novel approach in ITP treatment.((PMID:27267711))Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, is expressed in preosteoclasts. Previously we evaluated the bone phenotype of CD11b-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice and demonstrated enhanced osteoclasts and decreased bone mass in males. However, an assessment of the effects of Runx1 deletion in female osteoclast precursors was impossible with this model. Moreover, the role of Runx1 in myeloid cell differentiation into other lineages is unknown. Therefore, we generated LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice, which delete Runx1 equally (∼80% deletion) in myeloid precursor cells from both sexes and examined the capacity of these cells to differentiate into osteoclasts and phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells. Both female and male LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice had decreased trabecular bone mass (72% decrease in bone volume fraction) and increased osteoclast number (2-3 times) (P < .05) without alteration of osteoblast histomorphometric indices. We also demonstrated that loss of Runx1 in pluripotential myeloid precursors with LysM-Cre did not alter the number of myeloid precursor cells in bone marrow or their ability to differentiate into phagocytizing or antigen-presenting cells. This study demonstrates that abrogation of Runx1 in multipotential myeloid precursor cells significantly and specifically enhanced the ability of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand to stimulate osteoclast formation and fusion in female and male mice without affecting other myeloid cell fates. In turn, increased osteoclast activity in LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice likely contributed to a decrease in bone mass. These dramatic effects were not due to increased osteoclast precursors in the deleted mutants and argue that inhibition of Runx1 in multipotential myeloid precursor cells is important for osteoclast formation and function.((PMID:27164167))Cell fate of lower Müllerian duct epithelium (MDE), to become uterine or vaginal epithelium, is determined by the absence or presence of ΔNp63 expression, respectively. Previously, we showed that SMAD4 and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were independently required for MDE to express ΔNp63. Here, we report that vaginal mesenchyme directs vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE through paracrine activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-MAPK pathway. In the developing reproductive tract, FGF7 and FGF10 were enriched in vaginal mesenchyme, whereas FGF receptor 2IIIb was expressed in epithelia of both the uterus and vagina. When Fgfr2 was inactivated, vaginal MDE underwent uterine cell fate, and this differentiation defect was corrected by activation of MEK-ERK pathway. In vitro, FGF10 in combination with bone morphogenetic protein 4 and activin A (ActA) was sufficient to induce ΔNp63 in MDE, and ActA was essential for induction of RUNX1 through SMAD-independent pathways. Accordingly, inhibition of type 1 receptors for activin in neonatal mice induced uterine differentiation in vaginal epithelium by down-regulating RUNX1, whereas conditional deletion of Smad2 and Smad3 had no effect on vaginal epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE is induced by FGF7/10-MAPK, bone morphogenetic protein 4-SMAD, and ActA-RUNX1 pathway activities, and the disruption in any one of these pathways results in conversion from vaginal to uterine epithelial cell fate.((PMID:27150991))To explore the application of combined detection of fusion gene and BIOMED-2 standardized immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement system in diagnosis and treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Multiplex-PCR amplifications and RQ-PCR of RNA/DNA were performed using ALL fusion gene detection kit and BIOMED-2 primer. The Ig gene rearrangements were analyzed by using PCR fragment analysis system.Out of 251 children with B-ALL, 77 cases were TEL-AML1(+) , 28 cases were E2A-PBX1(+) , 10 cases were MLL-AF4(+) , 11 cases were BCR-ABL(+) , the total positive rate was 50.2%, 82.5% showed IgH VH-JH rearrangement, 53.4% showed IgK rearrangement. The positive rate of combined detection of fusion gene and gene rearrangement was 99%. E2A-PBX1(+) and MLL-AF4(+) with IgK(+) gene rearrangement group was compared with negative control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001 or P = 0.005); 105 ALL fusion gene positive cases had been detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) simultaneously, the accordance rate of fusion gene and FISH was more than 94%.The combined detection of ALL fusion gene and BIOMED-2 standardized clonality analysis system can improve the positive detected rate of B-ALL dramatically, and make the grouping of disease prognosis more accurately; this combined detection is a more faster and sensitive method than FISH.((PMID:27112265))Less than 50 patients with FPD/AML (OMIM 601309) have been reported as of today and there may an underestimation. The purpose of this study was to describe the natural history, the haematological features and the genotype-phenotype correlations of this entity in order to, first, screen it better and earlier, before leukaemia occurrence and secondly to optimize appropriate monitoring and treatment, in particular when familial stem cell transplantation is considered.We have investigated 41 carriers of RUNX1 alteration belonging to nine unrelated French families with FPD/AML and two syndromic patients, registered in the French network on rare platelet disorders from 2005 to 2015.Five missense, one non-sense, three frameshift mutations and two large deletions involving several genes including RUNX1 were evidenced. The history of familial leukaemia was suggestive of FPD/AML in seven pedigrees, whereas an autosomal dominant pattern of lifelong thrombocytopenia was the clinical presentation of two. Additional syndromic features characterized two large sporadic deletions. Bleeding tendency was mild and thrombocytopenia moderate (>50 x10(9)/L), with normal platelet volume. A functional platelet defect consistent with a δ-granule release defect was found in ten patients regardless of the type of RUNX1 alteration. The incidence of haematological malignancies was higher when the mutated RUNX1 allele was likely to cause a dominant negative effect (19/34) in comparison with loss of function alleles (3/9). A normal platelet count does not rule out the diagnosis of FPD/AML, since the platelet count was found normal for three mutated subjects, a feature that has a direct impact in the search for a related donor in case of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Platelet dysfunction suggestive of defective δ-granule release could be of values for the diagnosis of FPD/AML particularly when the clinical presentation is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size in the absence of familial malignancies. The genotype-phenotype correlations might be helpful in genetic counselling and appropriate optimal therapeutic management.((PMID:27054428))The study shows how the influence of titanium surfaces on human mesenchymal stem cells differentiates toward osteocytes lineage and how, after growth, on machined titanium disk or etched titanium disk, changes, in gene expression for RUNX1, CTNNB1, SP7, and DLX5.Genes were analyzed by means of quantitative real-time polimerase chain reaction. Osseo genic lineage differentiation was also tested by means of the catenin-β1 immunofluorescence, induced osteoblasts, which represented the internal control.The RUNX1 and SP7 expressions in the induced osteoblasts prove to be different, compared with cells cultured on metallic supports. Moreover, the levels of expression of the runt-related transcription factor 1 and the osterix appeared more down-regulated in cells that grew on a machined titanium surface. In the present experimental model, mRNA expression of DLX5 and CTNNB1 in human mesenchymal stem cells, cultured on each of the titanium surfaces, showed no differences, compared with osteoblast-induced cells. The immunofluorescence scores, for protein expression of beta-catenin in human mesenchymal stem cell treated cells, illustrates significantly improved results with the etched surface.Present results suggested that different titanium surfaces might induce some differences in terms of gene expression. The only gene analyzed, which proved significant differences between the 2 titanium supports, was SP7; however, the other 3 genes indicating the existence of differences between the 2 titanium groups.((PMID:27014980))To evaluate the safety and efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors T cells (CAR-T) in childhood acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).A relapsed B-ALL child after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was treated with CAR-T, and the related literatures were reviewed.An 11-year-old girl with TEL-AML1 fusion gene positive BALL who suffered a bone marrow relapse 28 months after remission from conventional chemotherapy. During the second remission, the patient received haploidentical allo-HSCT. She relapsed with detectable TEL-AML1 fusion gene even after chemotherapy and donor leukocyte infusions. She received an experimental donor-derived fourth generation CD19 CAR-T therapy. After infusion of 1 × 10(6)/kg CAR-T cells, she experienced only mild or moderate cytokine-release syndrome and the minimal residual disease turned negative. Then three maintenance of CAR-T cell infusions [(0.83-1.65)×10(6)/kg] was administered, and the disease-free survival had lasted for 10 months. However, the TEL-AML1 copies in her blood still increased and she died with leukemia relapse after additional CAR-T cell infusion.Treatment of relapsed B-ALL with the fourth generation CAR-T cells directed against CD19 was effective and safe. CAR-T therapy is a novel therapeutic approach that could be useful for patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL who have failed all other treatment options.((PMID:26994850))Homoharringtonine combined aclarubicin and cytarabine (HAA) has been demonstrated to achieve a high remission rate and provide a survival advantage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate whether HAA is an ideal induction regimen for t(8;21)AML, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 140 patients from the last 8 years in our center. When achieving complete remission (CR), the post-remission treatment was administered as a minimal residual disease-directed risk-stratification treatment protocol. The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was assessed by RT-qPCR. The last follow-up was conducted in October 2015. In total, thirty patients received an HAA regimen as the induction treatment. The CR rate after one cycle of the HAA regimen was 93.3% (28/30). One patient achieved partial remission, and one had no response. No patients died during induction treatment. The median fold decrease of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was 200 (1-358000), and 16.7% (5/30) patients achieved >3 log decrease after one cycle of the HAA regimen. The estimated 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 89.9% and 90.8%, respectively. We concluded that the HAA regimen is highly effective as the first course of induction therapy for t(8;21) AML, and this needs to be confirmed in a large population in the future.((PMID:26990877))A network of lineage-specific transcription factors and microRNAs tightly regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells along the distinct lineages. Deregulation of this regulatory network contributes to impaired lineage fidelity and leukemogenesis. We found that the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 controls the expression of certain microRNAs, of importance during erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation. In particular, we show that the erythorid miR144/451 cluster is epigenetically repressed by RUNX1 during megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion protein transcriptionally represses the miR144/451 pre-microRNA. Thus RUNX1/ETO contributes to increased expression of miR451 target genes and interferes with normal gene expression during differentiation. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of RUNX1/ETO in Kasumi1 cells and in RUNX1/ETO positive primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples leads to up-regulation of miR144/451. RUNX1 thus emerges as a key regulator of a microRNA network, driving differentiation at the megakaryocytic/erythroid branching point. The network is disturbed by the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion product.((PMID:26907657))RUNX1 (AML1) amplification in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has been associated with poor survival for unclear reasons. Our anecdotal experience suggests that children with B-ALL and RUNX1 amplification might be predisposed to thrombosis.We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with B-ALL treated from 2008 to 2014 at the North Carolina Children's Hospital. Patient demographics, cytogenetics, and diagnosis of thrombosis were extracted by blinded chart review. Analysis was performed examining the relationship between RUNX1 amplification and thrombosis.We identified 119 patients with B-ALL and a median age of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.9 to 8.6 y) at diagnosis. Four patients (3%) had RUNX1 amplification. The average number of RUNX1 copies among those with amplification was 5 (SD 0.81 [range, 4 to 6]). Eighteen thromboses were diagnosed within 6 months of starting treatment. These events were more likely among patients with RUNX1 amplification than in patients without amplification (75% vs. 13%; RR 5.75, 95% confidence interval, 2.75-12.01).RUNX1 amplification may predispose to early thrombotic events in children with B-ALL which could, in part, contribute to their poorer outcomes. Treatment implications, including possible prophylactic anticoagulation of patients with of RUNX1 amplification, justify larger studies to confirm these findings.((PMID:26901859))RUNX1 a member of the family of runt related transcription factors (RUNX), is essential for hematopoiesis. The expression of RUNX1 gene is controlled by two promoters; the distal P1 promoter and the proximal P2 promoter. Several isoforms of RUNX1 mRNA are generated through the use of both promoters and alternative splicing. These isoforms not only differs in their temporal expression pattern but also exhibit differences in tissue specificity. The RUNX1 isoforms derived from P2 are expressed in a variety of tissues, but expression of P1-derived isoform is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage. However, the control of hematopoietic-cell specific expression is poorly understood. Here we report regulation of P1-derived RUNX1 mRNA by RUNX1 protein. In silico analysis of P1 promoter revealed presence of two evolutionary conserved RUNX motifs, 0.6kb upstream of the transcription start site, and three RUNX motifs within 170bp of the 5'UTR. Transcriptional contribution of these RUNX motifs was studied in myeloid and T-cells. RUNX1 genomic fragment containing all sites show very low basal activity in both cell types. Mutation or deletion of RUNX motifs in the UTR enhances basal activity of the RUNX1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RUNX1 protein is recruited to these sites. Overexpression of RUNX1 in non-hematopoietic cells results in a dose dependent activation of the RUNX1 P1 promoter. We also demonstrate that RUNX1 protein regulates transcription of endogenous RUNX1 mRNA in T-cell. Finally we show that SCL transcription factor is recruited to regions containing RUNX motifs in the promoter and the UTR and regulates activity of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in vitro. Thus, multiple lines of evidence show that RUNX1 protein regulates its own gene transcription.((PMID:27694501))((PMID:27673579))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with t(8;21) aberration often have favorable outcomes, however, relapse still occurs in 30%-40% patients, with only 50%-60% of patients with t(8;21) AML cured with regimens containing high-dose cytarabine (HD-Ara-C). To evaluate the effects of fludarabine and cytarabine (FA) consolidation therapy for t(8;21) AML patients, a prospective randomized study was performed. A total of 45 patients with t(8;21) AML after achieving complete remission (CR) were randomly assigned to receive four course consolidation with FA (n=23) or HD-Ara-C (n=22). Our study showed that at 36-months, relapse-free survival (RFS) was 81.73% in the FA arm and 50.73% in the HD-Ara-C arm (P=0.04), overall survival (OS) was 91.1% and 48.4% (P=0.01) in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively; whereas cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 18.27% and 47.39%, in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively (P=0.05). In our study, treatment with FA, MRD2 status (reduction ≥ 3-log) and absence of c-kit mutations were identified as independent prognostic factors for lower risk of relapse, improved RFS and OS. We also found RFS for patients without c-kit mutations was 100% in FA arm, and 57.8% in HD-Ara-C arm at 36 months (P=0.005); OS of both groups at 36 months was 100% and 51.4%, respectively (P=0.004), suggesting a benefit of consolidation therapy with FA for t(8;21) AML patients, especially, those without c-kit mutations (Clinicaltrials.org ID NCT# 02024308).

Runx genes regulate development and their products are transcription factors associated with cancer development. A Runx1 enhancer element, eR1 is a marker of hematopoietic stem cells. We studied expression from eR1 in stomach and the roles of gastric stem cells in gastric carcinogenesis in transgenic mice.We used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses to study expression of Runx1 in gastric tissues from C57BL/6 (control) mice. We then created mice that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or CreERT2 under the control of eR1 (eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-tdTomato, eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-EYFP mice). Gastric tissues were collected and lineage-tracing experiments were performed. Gastric organoids were cultured from eR1-CreERT2(5-2);Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice and immunofluorescence analyses were performed. We investigated the effects of expressing oncogenic mutations in stem cells under control of eR1 using eR1-CreERT2;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice; gastric tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence.Most proliferation occurred in the isthmus; 86% of proliferating cells were RUNX1 positive and 76% were MUC5AC positive. In eR1-EGFP mice, EGFP signals were mainly detected in the upper part of the gastric unit, and 83% of EGFP-positive cells were located in the isthmus/pit region. We found that eR1 marked undifferentiated stem cells in the isthmus and a smaller number of terminally differentiated chief cells at the base. eR1 also marked cells in the pyloric gland in the antrum. Lineage tracing experiments demonstrated that stem cells in the isthmus and antrum continuously gave rise to mature cells to maintain the gastric unit. eR1-positive cells in the isthmus and pyloric gland generated organoid cultures in vitro. In eR1-CreERT2;LSL-Kras G12D/+ mice, MUC5AC-positive cells rapidly differentiated from stem cells in the isthmus, resulting in distinct metaplastic lesions similar to that observed in human gastric atrophy.Using lineage tracing experiments in mice, we found that a Runx1 enhancer element, eR1, promotes its expression in the isthmus stem cells of stomach corpus as well; as pyloric gland in the antrum. We were able to use eR1 to express oncogenic mutations; in gastric stem cells, proving a new model for studies of gastric carcinogenesis.((PMID:27667480))Down syndrome (DS) is the most common birth defect in children. To investigate the mechanisms of DS, the present study analyzed the bisulfite‑sequencing (seq) data GSE42144, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. GSE42144 included DNA methylation data of three DS samples and three control samples, and RNA‑seq data of two DS samples and five control samples. The methylated sites in the bisulfite‑seq data were detected using Bismark and Bowtie2. The BiSeq tool was applied to determine differentially methylated regions and to identify adjacent genes. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, the functions of the abnormal demethylated genes were predicted by functional enrichment analyses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened using a paired t‑test. Furthermore, the interactions of the proteins encoded by selected genes were determined using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Cytoscape. A total of 74 CpG regions showed significant differential DNA methylation between the DS and normal samples. There were five abnormal demethylated DNA regions in chromosome 21. In the DS samples, a total of 43 adjacent genes were identified with demethylation in their promoter regions and one adjacent gene was identified with upregulated methylation in its promoter regions. In addition, 584 upregulated genes were identified, including 24 genes with transcriptional regulatory function. In particular, upregulated Runt‑related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was located on chromosome 21. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) was involved in neuronal differentiation and transcriptional suppression. In the PPI network, genes may be involved in DS by interacting with others, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2)‑early growth response (EGR)2 and NR4A2‑EGR3. Therefore, RUNX1, NR4A2, EGR2, EGR3 and ID4 may be key genes associated with the pathogenesis of DS.((PMID:27664585))The t(12;21)(p13;q22) with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion occurs in 25% of cases of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL); and is generally associated with favorable prognosis. However, 15-20% of the t(12;21)-positive cases are associated with high-risk disease due to for example slow early responses to therapy. It is well-known that development of overt leukemia in t(12;21)-positive ALL requires secondary chromosomal aberrations although the full spectrum of these cytogenetic alterations is yet unsettled, and also, how they may be associated with disease outcome. This report describes the case of an adolescent male with t(12;21)-positive ALL who displayed a G-banded karyotype initially interpreted as del(1)(p22p13) and del(15)(q15). The patient was treated according to NOPHO standard risk protocol at diagnosis, but had minimal residual disease (MRD) at 6,4% on day 29 as determined by flowcytometric immunophenotyping. Because of MRD level>0.1% he was then assigned as a high risk patient and received intensified chemotherapy accordingly. Further molecular cytogenetic studies and oligo-based aCGH (oaCGH) analysis characterized the acquired complex structural rearrangements on chromosomes 1 and 15, which can be described as der(1)del(1)(p13.1p31.1)t(1;15)(q42;q15) with concurrent deletions at 1q31.2-q31.3, 1q42.12-q43, and 15q15.1-q15.3. The unbalanced complex rearrangements have not been described previously. Extended locus-specific FISH analyses showed that the three deletions were on the same chromosome 1 homologue that was involved in the t(1;15), and that the deletion on chromosome 15 also was on the same chromosome 15 homologue as involved in the t(1;15). Together these findings show the great importance of the combined usage of molecular cytogenetic analyses and oaCGH analysis to enhance characterization of apparently simple G-banded karyotypes, and to provide a more complete spectrum of secondary chromosomal aberrations in high risk t(12;21)-positive BCP-ALLs.((PMID:27650541))Overwhelming evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their role in the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL, one of the most frequent subtypes of pediatric leukemia. First, we used primary leukemia patient samples to identify an ETV6/RUNX1 specific expression signature consisting of 596 lncRNA transcripts. Next, integration of this lncRNA signature with RNA sequencing of BCP-ALL cell lines and lncRNA profiling of an in vitro model system of ETV6/RUNX1 knockdown, revealed that lnc-NKX2-3-1, lnc-TIMM21-5, lnc-ASTN1-1 and lnc-RTN4R-1 are truly regulated by the oncogenic fusion protein. Moreover, sustained inactivation of lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cells caused profound changes in gene expression. All together, our study defined a unique lncRNA expression signature associated with ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL and identified lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 as lncRNAs that might be functionally implicated in the biology of this prevalent subtype of human leukemia.((PMID:27637333))Transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-family are essential for antigen-specific T cell activation and differentiation. Their cooperative DNA binding with other transcription factors, such as AP1-proteins (FOS, JUN, JUNB), FOXP3, IRFs and EGR1, dictate the gene regulatory action of NFATs. To identify as yet unknown interaction partners of NFAT, we purified biotin tagged NFATc1/αA, NFATc1/βC and NFATc2/C protein-complexes and analyzed their components by SILAC-based mass spectrometry. We revealed more than 170 NFAT associated proteins, half of which are involved in transcriptional regulation. Among them are known, as well as many unknown interaction partners of NFATc1 and NFATc2 in T cells, such as Raptor, CHEK1, CREB1, RUNX1, SATB1, Ikaros and Helios. The association of NFATc2 with several other transcription factors is DNA-dependent, indicating cooperative DNA binding. Moreover, our computational analysis discovered that binding motifs for RUNX and CREB1 are found preferentially in the direct vicinity of NFAT binding motifs and in a distinct orientation to them. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mTOR and CHEK1 kinase activity influence NFAT's transcriptional potency. Finally, our dataset of NFAT-associated proteins provides a good basis to further study NFAT's diverse functions and how these are modulated due to the interplay of multiple interaction partners.((PMID:27634876))While decades of research have identified molecular pathways inducing and promoting stages of prostate cancer malignancy, studies addressing dynamic changes of cancer-related regulatory factors in a prostate tumor progression model are limited. Using the TRAMP mouse model of human prostate cancer, we address mechanisms of deregulation for the cancer-associated transcription factors, Runx1 and Runx2 by identifying microRNAs with reciprocal expression changes at six time points during 33 weeks of tumorigenesis. We molecularly define transition stages from PIN lesions to hyperplasia/neoplasia and progression to adenocarcinoma by temporal changes in expression of human prostate cancer markers, including the androgen receptor and tumor suppressors, Nkx3.1 and PTEN. Concomitant activation of PTEN, AR, and Runx factors occurs at early stages. At late stages, PTEN and AR are downregulated, while Runx1 and Runx2 remain elevated. Loss of Runx-targeting microRNAs, miR-23b-5p, miR-139-5p, miR-205-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-382-5p, and miR-384-5p, contribute to aberrant Runx expression in prostate tumors. Our studies reveal a Runx/miRNA interaction axis centered on PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling. This regulatory network translates to mechanistic understanding of prostate tumorigenesis that can be developed for diagnosis and directed therapy.((PMID:27620872))Around 20-25 % of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias carry the ETV6-RUNX1 (E/R) fusion gene - a fusion of two central hematopoietic transcription factors, ETV6 (TEL) and RUNX1 (AML1). Despite its prevalence, the exact genomic targets of E/R have remained elusive. We evaluated gene loci and enhancers targeted by E/R genome-wide in precursor B acute leukemia cells using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). We show that expression of the E/R fusion leads to widespread repression of RUNX1-motif containing enhancers at its target gene loci. Moreover, multiple super-enhancers from CD19/CD20-lineage were repressed implicating a role in impediment of lineage commitment. In effect, the expression of several genes involved in B cell signaling and adhesion was downregulated, and the repression depended on the wild-type DNA-binding Runt domain of RUNX1. We also identified a number of E/R-regulated annotated and de novo noncoding genes. The results provide a comprehensive genome-wide mapping between E/R-regulated key regulatory elements and genes in precursor B cell leukemia that disrupt normal B lymphopoiesis.((PMID:27618722))Down syndrome (DS) is the leading genetic cause of mental retardation and is caused by a third copy of human chromosome 21. The different pathologies of DS involve many tissues with a distinct array of neural phenotypes. Here we characterize embryonic stem cell lines with DS (DS-ESCs), and focus on the neural aspects of the disease. Our results show that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from five independent DS-ESC lines display increased apoptosis and downregulation of forehead developmental genes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested RUNX1 as a key transcription regulator in DS-NPCs. Using genome editing we were able to disrupt all three copies of RUNX1 in DS-ESCs, leading to downregulation of several RUNX1 target developmental genes accompanied by reduced apoptosis and neuron migration. Our work sheds light on the role of RUNX1 and the importance of dosage balance in the development of neural phenotypes in DS.((PMID:27617577))Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its candidacy as a therapeutic target has been evaluated. Gal-3 is widely upregulated in tumors, and its expression is associated with the development and malignancy of PDAC. In the present study, we demonstrate that a polysaccharide, RN1, purified from the flower of Panax notoginseng binds to Gal-3 and suppresses its expression. In addition, RN1 markedly inhibits PDAC cells growth in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, RN1 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gal-3, thereby disrupting the interaction between Gal-3 and EGFR and downregulating extracellular-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and the transcription factor of Gal-3, Runx1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of Runx1 by RN1, suppresses Gal-3 expression and inactivates Gal-3-associated signaling pathways, including the EGFR/ERK/Runx1, BMP/smad/Id-3 and integrin/FAK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, RN1 can also bind to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2) and block the interaction between Gal-3 and the BMPRs. Thus, our results suggest that a novel Gal-3 inhibitor RN1 may be a potential candidate for human PDAC treatment via multiple targets and multiple signaling pathways.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.306.((PMID:27611867))Precursor-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling represents a crucial checkpoint at the pre-B cell stage. Aberrant pre-BCR signaling is considered as a key factor for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) development. BCP-ALL are believed to be arrested at the pre-BCR checkpoint independent of pre-BCR expression. However, the cellular stage at which BCP-ALL are arrested and whether this relates to expression of the pre-BCR components (IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1) is still unclear. Here, we show differential protein expression and copy number variation (CNV) patterns of the pre-BCR components in pediatric BCP-ALL. Moreover, analyzing six BCP-ALL data sets (n = 733), we demonstrate that TCF3-PBX1 ALL express high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1, and are arrested at the pre-B stage. By contrast, ETV6-RUNX1 ALL express low levels of IGHM or VPREB1, and are arrested at the pro-B stage. Irrespective of subtype, ALL with high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1 are arrested at the pre-B stage and correlate with good prognosis in high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL (n = 207). Our findings suggest that BCP-ALL are arrested at different cellular stages, which relates to the expression pattern of the pre-BCR components that could serve as prognostic markers for high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL patients.((PMID:27601546))The genetic basis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is heterogeneous, and various combinations of somatic mutations are associated with different clinical phenotypes and outcomes. Whether the genetic basis of MDS influences the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is unclear.We studied 401 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from MDS (MDS/AML). We used massively parallel sequencing to examine tumor samples collected before HSCT for somatic mutations in 34 recurrently mutated genes in myeloid neoplasms. We then analyzed the impact of mutations on the outcome of HSCT.Overall, 87% of patients carried one or more oncogenic mutations. Somatic mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 were independent predictors of relapse and overall survival after HSCT in both patients with MDS and patients with MDS/AML (P values ranging from .003 to .035). In patients with MDS/AML, gene ontology (ie, secondary-type AML carrying mutations in genes of RNA splicing machinery, TP53-mutated AML, or de novo AML) was an independent predictor of posttransplantation outcome (P = .013). The impact of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 mutations on posttransplantation survival was independent of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Combining somatic mutations and IPSS-R risk improved the ability to stratify patients by capturing more prognostic information at an individual level. Accounting for various combinations of IPSS-R risk and somatic mutations, the 5-year probability of survival after HSCT ranged from 0% to 73%.Somatic mutation in ASXL1, RUNX1, or TP53 is independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after allogeneic HSCT for patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Accounting for these genetic lesions may improve the prognostication precision in clinical practice and in designing clinical trials.((PMID:27599428))Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are not only a valuable resource for regenerative medicine, but also a promising tool for disease modeling and drug discovery. Patient-specific iPSCs harboring disease-specific mutations are extremely useful for investigating disease mechanisms and novel treatment approaches. In the field of hematology, attempts to establish iPSCs from tumor cells such as those of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were largely unsuccessful because proper reprogramming processes were hampered by their extensive genetic alterations. In contrast, congenital disorders caused by a single genetic mutation are ideal candidates for deriving iPSCs. We have been investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying leukemia and MDS by implementing iPSC technology. Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a high propensity for developing acute leukemia, which is caused by heterozygous mutation of RUNX1. We have successfully established iPSCs from three distinct FPD pedigrees and examined the responsible defect during hematopoietic development. This system will serve as a novel unprecedented platform for prospectively studying hematologic disorders using human cells.((PMID:27591551))A novel role for phenotypic transcription factors in very early differentiation was recently observed and merits further study to elucidate what role this precocious expression may have in development. The RUNX1 transcription factor exhibits selective and transient upregulation during early mesenchymal differentiation. In contrast to phenotype-associated transcriptional control of gene expression to establish and sustain hematopoietic/myeloid lineage identity, precocious expression of RUNX1 is functionally linked to control of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition that is obligatory for development. This early RUNX1 expression spike provides a paradigm for precocious expression of a phenotypic transcription factor that invites detailed mechanistic study to fully understand its biological importance.

We found an overall greater mutational burden and more driver mutations in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients compared to B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients. In addition, the majority of the mutations in T-ALL had occurred in the original leukemic clone, while most of the mutations in BCP-ALL were subclonal. BCP-ALL patients carrying any of the recurrent translocations ETV6-RUNX1, BCR-ABL or TCF3-PBX1 harbored few mutations in driver genes compared to other BCP-ALL patients. Specifically in BCP-ALL, we identified ATRX as a novel putative driver gene and uncovered an association between somatic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway at ALL diagnosis and increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, we identified EP300, ARID1A and SH2B3 as relapse-associated genes. The genes highlighted in our study were frequently involved in epigenetic regulation, associated with germline susceptibility to ALL, and present in minor subclones at diagnosis that became dominant at relapse. We observed a high degree of clonal heterogeneity and evolution between diagnosis and relapse in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL, which could have implications for the treatment efficiency.((PMID:27690235))DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is an enzyme involved in DNA methylation that is frequently mutated in human hematologic malignancies. We have previously shown that inactivation of Dnmt3a in hematopoietic cells results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in mice. Here we show that 12% of Dnmt3a-deficient mice develop CD8+ mature peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) and 29% of mice are affected by both diseases. 10% of Dnmt3a+/- mice develop lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in PTCL. DNA methylation was deregulated genome-wide with 10-fold more hypo- than hypermethylated promoters and enhancers, demonstrating that hypomethylation is a major event in the development of PTCL. Hypomethylated promoters were enriched for binding sites of transcription factors AML1, NF-κB and OCT1, implying the transcription factors potential involvement in Dnmt3a-associated methylation. Whereas 71 hypomethylated genes showed an increased expression in PTCL, only 3 hypermethylated genes were silenced, suggesting that cancer-specific hypomethylation has broader effects on the transcriptome of cancer cells than hypermethylation. Interestingly, transcriptomes of Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ lymphomas were largely conserved and significantly overlapped with those of human tumors. Importantly, we observed downregulation of tumor suppressor p53 in Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ lymphomas as well as in pre-tumor thymocytes from 9 months old but not 6 weeks old Dnmt3a+/- tumor-free mice, suggesting that p53 downregulation is chronologically an intermediate event in tumorigenesis. Decrease in p53 is likely an important event in tumorigenesis because its overexpression inhibited proliferation in mouse PTCL cell lines, suggesting that low levels of p53 are important for tumor maintenance. Altogether, our data link the haploinsufficient tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3a in the prevention of mouse mature CD8+ PTCL indirectly to a bona fide tumor suppressor of T cell malignancies p53.((PMID:27587249))To investigate frequency and clinical features of additional sex combs-like 2 (ASXL2) gene mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene and to analyze the relationship between ASXL2 gene mutation and c- kit gene mutation.Mutation analysis of exon 11 and 12 of ASXL2 gene in 59 de novo AML patients was performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The clinical features, survival curve and c-kit gene mutation in ASXL2 gene mutation positive and negative patients were compared.In a total of 59 AML patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene positive, 11.9% (7/59) patients harboured ASXL2 gene mutations. The hemoglobin levels of patients with mutated ASXL2 gene [56.2 (38.0- 72.0) g/L] were significantly lower than those with wild type ASXL2 [69.0(37.2-154.0) g/L] (P=0.038). Differences were not observed in white blood cell counts, platelet counts, the proportion of acidophilic cell, and the proportion of primitive cell in the marrow between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). None of all 59 patients suffered from liver, spleen, central nervous system metastases in both groups. Moreover, enlarged lymph nodes was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.859). Immunophenotypic analysis: in positive group CD33 positive expression was significantly lower than that of negative group (P=0.033). cCD3 was not expressed in both groups. Expression levels of CD117, cMPO, HLA-DR, CD34, CD38, CD13, CD44, CD15, CD64, CD11b, CD56, CD19, cCD79a and CD7 were similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). All of 59 patients were in remission (P=0.577). Overall survival was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.631). The mutation rates of c- kit in positive group and negative group were 14.3% and 29.4%, without statistical significance (P= 0.697).ASXL2 mutation may be a new event that can cooperate with AML1-ETO to induce leukemia. Patients in AML1- ETO positive AML with ASXL2 mutation show specific clinical characteristics of hemoglobin levels and expression level of CD33. ASXL2 gene mutations and c-kit gene mutations may not have a specific correlation between them.((PMID:27576335))Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) sequences make up ~8% of the human genome and increased expression of some HERV proteins has been observed in various pathologies including leukaemia and multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the function of these HERV proteins or environmental factors which regulate their expression. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used very extensively as antimicrobials and antivirals in numerous consumer products although their effect on the expression of HERV gene products is unknown. Cell proliferation and cell toxicity assays were carried out on human acute T lymphoblastic leukaemia (MOLT-4) and Fanconi anaemia associated acute myeloid leukaemia (FA-AML1) cells treated with two different sizes of AgNPs (7nm and 50nm diameter). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were then used to the assess expression of HERV-W syncytin-1 mRNA and protein in these cells. FA-AML1 cells were more sensitive overall than MOLT-4 to treatment with the smaller 7nm sized AgNp's being the most toxic in these cells. MOLT-4 cell were more resistant and showed no evidence of differential toxicity to the different sized particles. Syncytin-1 mRNA and protein were induced by both 7 and 50nm AgNPs in both cell types yet with different kinetics. In summary, the observation that AgNPs induce expression of syncytin-1 in FA-AML1 and MOLT-4 cells at doses as little as 5 µg/ml is grounds for concern since this protein is up-regulated in both malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the widespread use of AgNPs in the environment it is clear that their ability to induce syncytin-1 should be investigated further in other cell types.((PMID:27554046))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) critically regulate gene expression by determining the acetylation status of histones. In addition, studies have increasingly focused on the activities of HDACs, especially involving non-histone proteins, and their various biological effects. Aberrant HDAC expression observed in several kinds of human tumors makes HDACs potential targets for cancer treatment. Several preclinical studies have suggested that HDAC inhibitors exhibit some efficacy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with AML1-ETO, which mediates transcriptional repression through its interaction with a complex including HDAC1. Recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators are found in T-cell lymphomas (TCLs), and HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents were shown to act cooperatively in the treatment of TCLs. Preclinical modeling has suggested that persistent activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway could serve as a useful biomarker of resistance to HDAC inhibitor in patients with cutaneous TCL. Panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, has achieved longer progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) than the placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Panobinostat inhibited MM cell growth by degrading protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit α (PPP3CA), a catalytic subunit of calcineurin. This degradation was suggested to be mediated by the blockade of the chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) due to HDAC6 inhibition. Aberrant PPP3CA expression in advanced MM indicated a possible correlation between high PPP3CA expression and the pathogenesis of MM. Furthermore, PPP3CA was suggested as a common target of panobinostat and bortezomib. This article is protected by copyright.

A frequent concomitant event is the loss of the residual ETV6 allele suggesting a critical role for the ETV6 transcriptional repressor in the etiology of this cancer. However, the precise mechanism through which loss of functional ETV6 contributes to disease pathogenesis is still unclear. To investigate the impact of ETV6 loss on the transcriptional network and to identify new transcriptional targets of ETV6, we used whole transcriptome analysis of both pre-B leukemic cell lines and patients combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using this integrative approach, we identified 4 novel direct ETV6 target genes: CLIC5, BIRC7, ANGPTL2 and WBP1L. To further evaluate the role of chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC5 in leukemogenesis, we generated cell lines overexpressing CLIC5 and demonstrated an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. We further described the implications of CLIC5's ion channel activity in lysosomal-mediated cell death, possibly by modulating the function of transferrin receptor with which it co-localizes intracellularly. For the first time, we showed that loss of ETV6 leads to significant overexpression of CLIC5, which in turn leads to decreased lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that heightened CLIC5 activity could promote a permissive environment for oxidative-stress induced DNA damage accumulation and thereby contribute to leukemogenesis.((PMID:27531762))To analyse the clinical features and prognostic significance of cross-lineage antigen expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML) in order to establish individualized treatment for a better outcome and prognosis.A total of 227 cases (exduding M3) were detected by flow cytometry for immune phenotype. The CD7(-)CD56(-)CD19(-) AML served as control. The clinical features, treatment response and prognosis of CD7(+) group, CD56(+) group and CD19(+) group were compared.The detection rate of CD56(+),CD7(+) and CD19(+) in AML was 15.9%, 25.1% and 11.0%, respectively. There were no differences between CD56(+) AML, CD7(+) AML, CD19(+) AML, and CD56(-)CD7(-)CD19(-) AML in the proportion of blast cells, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count and MDS transformed AML rate. The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD56(+) AML patients were lower than those in the control group (20.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.0099; 73.3% vs 87.5%, P=0.04). The median time of CR in CD56(+) AML was longer than that in the control group (118 days vs 46 days, P=0.04). The PFS time and OS time of CD56(+) AML were shorter than those in the control group (245 days vs 580 days, P=0.037; 494 days vs 809 days, P=0.04). The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD19(+) AML patients were higher than those in the control group(75.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.46; 100% vs 87.5%, P=0.02). The median time of CR in CD19(+) AML was shorter than that in the control group (28 days vs 46 days, P=0.02). The PFS time and OS time of CD19(+) AML tended to be longer than those in the control group (P=0.13, P=0.07, respectively). The median PFS and OS were not reached at the time of last follow-up. The CR after the first course chemotherapy, cumulative CR and median time to CR in CD7(+) AML patients were not different from those in the control group (53.1% vs 58.1%, P=0.67; 87.1% vs 87.5%, P=0.44; 50 days vs 46 days, P=0.44). No differences of PFS and OS were observed between CD7(+) AML and the control.CD56(+) AML patients respond poorly to treatment, frequently relapse after complete remission and have a low survival rate. These patients need more intensive chemotherapy or in combination with other treatments. The interval of MRD detection should be shortened to find out relapse earlier. CD19(+) AML patients have a good treatment outcome and often accompanies with AML1/ETO fusion gene, which is known to be a good prognostic marker. Aberrant expression of CD7 on AML cells is not a poor prognostic factor in this study.((PMID:27512117))Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) carrying t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) is classified as core binding factor (CBF)-AML and accounts for approximately 15% of AML. c-KIT mutation can be detected in 17%∼46% of CBF-AML and is associated with poor prognosis. c-KIT mutation is a crucial hit and cooperates with AML1-ETO resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) to cause overt AML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting c-KIT, such as imatinib, has been used successfully to treat c-KIT driven gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, the effect of TKI on c-KIT-driven leukemia, including CBF-AML and systemic mastocytosis (SM), has not been satisfactory. BPR1J373 is a 5-phenylthiazol-2-ylamine-pyriminide derivative targeting multiple tyrosine kinases. It was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells with constitutively activated c-KIT via inhibiting c-KIT phosphorylation and its downstream signals. The compound induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway through upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak and caspase 8 and 9 activation in c-KIT mutant Kasumi-1 cells. Furthermore, it induced cell-cycle arrest via targeting aurora kinase B in c-KIT wild-type KG-1 cells. The antitumor response of BPR1J373 was also shown in subcutaneously grafted SCID mice. BPR1J373 was shown to effectively suppress c-KIT phosphorylation of D816V mutation by treating c-KIT-null COS-1 cells transfected with c-KIT D816V mutant plasmid. In conclusion, BPR1J373 inhibits cell proliferation of c-KIT-driven AML cells via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. It is also effective for multiple drug-resistant c-KIT D816V mutation. BPR1J373 deserves further development for clinical use in c-KIT-driven myeloid leukemia.

Enabling replicative immortalization via telomerase reactivation is a crucial step in cancer development. However, AE expression alone is not sufficient to maintain high telomerase activity to immortalize human HSPC cells, which may hamper transformation. Here, we investigated the cooperativity of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, and AE in disease progression. Enforced expression of hTERT immortalized human AE pre-leukemia cells in a telomere-lengthening independent manner, and improved the pre-leukemia stem cell function by enhancing cell proliferation and survival. AE-hTERT cells retained cytokine dependency and multi-lineage differentiation potential similar to parental AE clones. Over the short-term, AE-hTERT cells did not show features of stepwise transformation, with no leukemogenecity evident upon initial injection into immunodeficient mice. Strikingly, after extended culture, we observed full transformation of one AE-hTERT clone, which recapitulated the disease evolution process in patients and emphasizes the importance of acquiring cooperating mutations in t(8;21) AML leukemogenesis. In summary, achieving unlimited proliferative potential via hTERT activation, and thereby allowing for acquisition of additional mutations, is a critical link for transition from pre-leukemia to overt disease in human cells. AE-hTERT cells represent a tractable model to study cooperating genetic lesions important for t(8;21) AML disease progression.((PMID:27486062))The presence of AML1-ETO (RUNX1-CBF2T1), a fusion oncoprotein resulting from a t(8;21) chromosomal translocation, has been implicated as a necessary but insufficient event in the development of a subset of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). While AML1-ETO prolongs survival and inhibits differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), other contributory events are needed for cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. We have postulated that specific tumor suppressor genes keep the leukemic potential of AML1-ETO in check. In studying del(9q), one of the most common concomitant chromosomal abnormalities with t(8;21), we identified the loss of an apparent tumor suppressor, TLE4, that appears to cooperate with AML1-ETO to confer a leukemic phenotype. This study sought to identify the molecular basis of this cooperation. We show that the loss of TLE4 confers proliferative advantage to leukemic cells, simultaneous with an upregulation of a pro- inflammatory signature mediated through aberrant increases in Wnt signaling activity. We further demonstrate that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity partly reverses the pro-leukemic phenotype due to TLE4 knockdown, pointing towards a novel therapeutic approach for myeloid leukemia.((PMID:27460334))It has been reported that amyloid precursor protein (APP) promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in various types of solid cancers. In our previous study, we showed that APP is highly expressed and regulates leukemia cell migration in AML1‑ETO-positive (AE) leukemia. Whether APP is involved in the regulation of AE leukemia cell proliferation or apoptosis is unclear. In the present study we focused on the correlation of APP with c-KIT mutation/overexpression and cell proliferation and apoptosis in AE leukemia. APP and c-KIT expression detected by quantitative real-time (qPCR) method, and c-KIT mutations screened using PCR in bone marrow cells from 65 patients with AE leukemia before their first chemotherapy, were simultaneously assessed. Furthermore, the Kasumi-1 cell line was chosen as the cell model, and the APP gene was knocked down using siRNA technology. The correlation of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis and c-Kit expression with APP expression levels, as well as the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by APP were analyzed in the Kasumi-1 cell line. The results showed that peripheral white blood cell counts (P=0.008) and bone marrow cellularity (P=0.031), but not bone marrow blasts, were correlated with APP expression. Moreover, the patients with APP high expression had a significantly higher incidence of c-KIT mutations (P<0.001) and increased levels of c-KIT expression (P=0.001) and poorer disease outcome. In the Kasumi-1 cell line, as compared with the wild-type and negative control cells, cell apoptosis, both early (P<0.001) and late (P<0.001), was significantly increased when the APP gene was knocked down, concomitant with reduced levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased levels of caspase-3 and -9, however, no apparent change was observed in the cell cycle distribution (P>0.05). Moreover, the knockdown of APP markedly decreased c-KIT expression at both the transcription (as evidenced by qPCR analysis) and translation (as confirmed by CD117 assay and western blot analysis) levels, as well as p-AKT and its downstream targets including NF-κB, p53 and Bcl-2. In conclusion, APP may cooperate with c-KIT mutation/overexpression in the regulation of cell apoptosis but not proliferation in AE leukemia via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.((PMID:27457952))Chromosomal translocation 8;21 is found in 40% of the FAB M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The resultant in-frame fusion protein AML1-ETO (AE) acts as an initiating oncogene for leukemia development. AE immortalizes human CD34(+) cord blood cells in long-term culture. We assessed the transforming properties of the alternatively spliced AE isoform AE9a (or alternative splicing at exon 9), which is fully transforming in a murine retroviral model, in human cord blood cells. Full activity was realized only upon increased fusion protein expression. This effect was recapitulated in the AE9a murine AML model. Cotransduction of AE and AE9a resulted in a strong selective pressure for AE-expressing cells. In the context of AE, AE9a did not show selection for increased expression, affirming observations of human t(8;21) patient samples where full-length AE is the dominant protein detected. Mechanistically, AE9a showed defective transcriptional regulation of AE target genes that was partially corrected at high expression. Together, these results bring an additional perspective to our understanding of AE function and highlight the contribution of oncogene expression level in t(8;21) experimental models.((PMID:27431573))MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. miRNAs act in diverse biological processes including development, cell growth, apoptosis, and hematopoiesis. The miRNA expression is associated with specific cytogenetic changes and can also be used to discriminate between the different subtypes of leukemia in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with common translocations, it is shown that the miRNAs have the potential to be used for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. We reviewed the roles of miRNA here with emphasis on their function in human leukemia and the mechanisms of the TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, MLL/AF4 and TCF3/PBX1 oncoproteins on miRNAs expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.((PMID:27418307))((PMID:27352183))Our objective is to explore the tumor-specific mutated genes by transcriptome sequencing of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. 96 patients with subtype M2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), admitted during January 2007 to January 2012, were selected. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from the patients after the first visit and the patients who were improved or alleviated, were subjected to high-throughput sequencing to compare the gene expression. The single nucleotide mutation related to subtype M2 AML was detected. Meanwhile, real-time fluorescent quantitation RT-PCR was used to detect the AML1/ETO fusion gene and its correlation with prognosis after treatment. Among 96 patients, AML1-ETO fusion gene was positive in 52 cases, the positive rate was 54.17 %. The complete relief (CR) rate of AML1-ETO fusion gene positive patients was 84.62 %, and the CR rate of AML1/ETO fusion gene negative patients was 77.27 %; the CR rate of AML1-ETO positive patients was higher than that of patients without the fusion gene, however there was no statistical difference. In the analysis of recurrent gene mutation in AML-M2 patients, IDH2, ASXL1, TET2, JAK1 and JAK2 gene expressions were not significantly different before treatment and after CR, however, IDHI, JAK3, ABL1 and BCR gene expressions were significantly different. In the study of transcriptome in AML-M2 patients, high-throughput sequencing could effectively detect the difference of the gene expression before treatment and after CR. Furthermore, positive expression of AML1-ETO fusion gene had effect on the prognosis of patients.((PMID:27346355))Homeobox genes are known to be key factors in leukemogenesis. Although the TALE family homeodomain factor Meis1 has been linked to malignancy, a role for MEIS2 is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that MEIS2 is expressed at high levels in patients with AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia and that growth of AML1-ETO-positive leukemia depends on MEIS2 expression. In mice, MEIS2 collaborates with AML1-ETO to induce acute myeloid leukemia. MEIS2 binds strongly to the Runt domain of AML1-ETO, indicating a direct interaction between these transcription factors. High expression of MEIS2 impairs repressive DNA binding of AML1-ETO, inducing increased expression of genes such as the druggable proto-oncogene YES1. Collectively, these data describe a pivotal role for MEIS2 in AML1-ETO-induced leukemia.((PMID:27276256))AML1-ETO is the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t (8;21)(q22;q22). It causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by dysregulating the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation and recently has been reported to bind multiple subunits of the mammalian cytosolic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT), primarily through its DNA binding domain (AML1-175). Through these interactions, TRiC plays an important role in the synthesis, folding, and activity of AML1-ETO. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we demonstrate here that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO's DNA-binding domain (AML1-175) forms a stable complex with apo-TRiC. Our structure reveals that AML1-175 associates directly with a specific subset of TRiC subunits in the open conformation.((PMID:27244239))Salicylate and acetylsalicylic acid are potent and widely used anti-inflammatory drugs. They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-κB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.((PMID:26209801))Prioritization of candidate genes emanating from large-scale screens requires integrated analyses at the genomics, molecular, network and structural biology levels. We have extended the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) to facilitate these tasks. The graphical user interface greatly simplifies building disease networks and zooming in at atomic resolution to identify variations in molecular complexes that may affect molecular interactions in the context of genomic data.

Case-specific information regarding flow cytometric, morphologic, and laboratory findings of this subtype of leukemia is currently lacking.We searched the databases of three large institutions for lymphoblastic leukemia with iAMP21 from 2005 through 2012 and analyzed the clinicopathologic features.We identified 17 cases with five or more RUNX1 signals on interphase nuclei, 14 of which were consistent with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) definition for iAMP21—namely, the presence of three or more RUNX1 signals on one marker chromosome. These cases showed a statistically significant lower peripheral WBC count and older age at diagnosis compared with all pediatric cases of B-ALL. We also identified three cases with increased RUNX1 signals scattered on multiple marker chromosomes that did not meet the COG definition of iAMP21 but showed similar 21q instability and older age at presentation.Our findings not only demonstrate that B-ALL with iAMP21 is truly a distinct clinicopathologic entity but also suggest that a subset of cases of B-ALL with iAMP21 can show variable cytogenetic features.((PMID:25760063))Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is a rare and aggressive type of cancer, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Identification of patients at high risk of TSCC tumorigenesis may provide information for the early detection of metastases, and for potential treatment strategies. MicroRNA (miRNA; miR) and mRNA expression profiling of TSCC tissue samples and normal control tissue samples were obtained from three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data series. Bioinformatics analyses, including the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were used to identify genes and pathways specifically associated with miRNA-associated TSCC oncology. A total of 25 miRNAs and 769 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the two groups assessed, and all the differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA target interactions were analyzed. The miRNA target genes were predominantly associated with 38 GO terms and 13 pathways. Of the genes differentially expressed between the two groups, and confirmed in another GEO series, miRNA-494, miRNA-96, miRNA-183, runt-related transcription factor 1, programmed cell death protein 4 and membrane-associated guanylate kinase were the most significantly altered, and may be central in the regulation of TSCC. Bioinformatics may be used to analyze large quantities of data in microarrays through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of complete data on TSCC. In the present study, a novel differential miRNA-mRNA expression network was constructed, and further investigation may provide novel targets for the diagnosis of TSCC.((PMID:25749719))The differentiation from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to mature and functional blood cells requires the finely tuned regulation of gene expression at each stage of development. Specific transcription factors play a key role in this process as they modulate the expression of their target genes in an exquisitely lineage-specific manner. A large number of important transcriptional regulators have been identified which establish and maintain specific gene expression patterns during hematopoietic development. Hematopoiesis is therefore a paradigm for investigating how transcription factors function in mammalian cells, thanks also to the evolution of genome-wide and the next-generation sequencing technologies. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of the biological and functional properties of the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFA2, PEBP2aB) transcription factor and its main downstream target PU.1. We will outline their relationship in determining the fate of the myeloid lineage during normal stem cell development and under conditions when hematopoietic development is subverted by leukemic transformation.((PMID:25540605))Our understanding of the genetic factors underlying juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is growing, but remains incomplete. Recently, a number of novel genetic loci were reported to be associated with JIA at (or near) genome-wide significance in a large case-control discovery sample using the Immunochip genotyping array. However, independent replication of findings has yet to be performed. We therefore attempted to replicate these newly identified loci in the Australian CLARITY JIA case-control sample.Genotyping was successfully performed on a total of 404 JIA cases (mean age 6.4 years, 68% female) and 676 healthy child controls (mean age 7.1 years, 42% female) across 19 SNPs previously associated with JIA. We replicated a significant association (p < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) in a direction consistent with the previous report) for seven loci, six replicated for the first time--C5orf56-IRF1 (rs4705862), ERAP2-LNPEP (rs27290), PRR5L (rs4755450), RUNX1 (rs9979383), RUNX3 (rs4648881), and UBE2L3 (rs2266959).We have carried out the first independent replication of association for six genes implicated in JIA susceptibility. Our data significantly strengthens the evidence that these loci harbor true disease associated variants. Thus, this study makes an important contribution to the growing body of international data that is revealing the genetic risk landscape of JIA.((PMID:25449688))To clarify the prevalence and prognostic significance of c-KIT mutations in patients with core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML), a total of 351 patients who were categorized as pediatric t(8;21), adult t(8;21), pediatric inv(16), or adult inv(16) were screened at diagnosis for c-KIT mutations in exons 17 and 8 using direct sequencing. A total of 250 patients underwent follow-up. Overall, 36.5% of the patients had a c-KIT mutation. Adult t(8;21) and inv(16) patients had mutations predominantly in exons 17 and 8, respectively. Higher White blood cell (WBC) count, WBC index, and AML1-ETO transcript levels in adult t(8;21) patients were significantly associated with c-KIT mutations and mutations in exon 17 (P≤0.030). c-KIT mutations in adult t(8;21) patients were significantly correlated with a high cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, P=0.0070) at 2 years and a low 2-year disease-free survival (DFS, P=0.013) and overall survival (OS, P=0.0055). However, no significant difference was revealed in the effect of c-KIT mutations on outcome of adult inv(16) and pediatric t(8;21) patients (all P>0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that c-KIT mutation is an independent prognostic factor for relapse, DFS, and OS (P≤0.016) in adult t(8;21) AML patients. Therefore, with regard to c-KIT mutation, CBF-AML is a heterogeneous disease. c-KIT mutations have a strong adverse effect on the relapse and survival of adult t(8;21) AML patients.((PMID:25378323))Thousands of unique mutations in transcription factors (TFs) arise in cancers, and the functional and biological roles of relatively few of these have been characterized. Here, we used structure-based methods developed specifically for DNA-binding proteins to systematically predict the consequences of mutations in several TFs that are frequently mutated in cancers. The explicit consideration of protein-DNA interactions was crucial to explain the roles and prevalence of mutations in TP53 and RUNX1 in cancers, and resulted in a higher specificity of detection for known p53-regulated genes among genetic associations between TP53 genotypes and genome-wide expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas, compared to existing methods of mutation assessment. Biophysical predictions also indicated that the relative prevalence of TP53 missense mutations in cancer is proportional to their thermodynamic impacts on protein stability and DNA binding, which is consistent with the selection for the loss of p53 transcriptional function in cancers. Structure and thermodynamics-based predictions of the impacts of missense mutations that focus on specific molecular functions may be increasingly useful for the precise and large-scale inference of aberrant molecular phenotypes in cancer and other complex diseases.((PMID:25139854))Haematopoiesis in adult animals is maintained by haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which self-renew and can give rise to all blood cell lineages. The AGM region is an important intra-embryonic site of HSC development and a wealth of evidence indicates that HSCs emerge from the endothelium of the embryonic dorsal aorta and extra-embryonic large arteries. This, however, is a stepwise process that occurs through sequential upregulation of CD41 and CD45 followed by emergence of fully functional definitive HSCs. Although largely dispensable at later stages, the Runx1 transcription factor is crucially important during developmental maturation of HSCs; however, exact points of crucial involvement of Runx1 in this multi-step developmental maturation process remain unclear. Here, we have investigated requirements for Runx1 using a conditional reversible knockout strategy. We report that Runx1 deficiency does not preclude formation of VE-cad+CD45-CD41+ cells, which are phenotypically equivalent to precursors of definitive HSCs (pre-HSC Type I) but blocks transition to the subsequent CD45+ stage (pre-HSC Type II). These data emphasise that developmental progression of HSCs during a very short period of time is regulated by precise stage-specific molecular mechanisms.((PMID:24981862))A large gap exists in our understanding of the course of differentiation from mesoderm to definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Previously, we reported that Runx1(+) cells in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) embryos contribute to the hemogenic endothelium in the E10.5 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and HSCs in the adult bone marrow. Here, we show that two Runx1(+) populations subdivided by Gata1 expression exist in E7.5 embryos. The hemogenic endothelium and the HSCs are derived only from the Runx1(+)Gata1(-) population. A subset of this population moves from the extra- to intraembryonic region during E7.5-E8.0, where it contributes to the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA). Migration occurs before the heartbeat is initiated, and it is independent of circulation. This suggests a developmental trajectory from Runx1(+) cells in the E7.5 extraembryonic region to definitive HSCs via the hemogenic endothelium.((PMID:24957142))Recent genomic studies have provided a refined genetic map of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and increased the number of potential prognostic markers. Therefore, we integrated copy-number alteration data from the 8 most commonly deleted genes, subordinately, with established chromosomal abnormalities to derive a 2-tier genetic classification. The classification was developed using 809 ALL97/99 patients and validated using 742 United Kingdom (UK)ALL2003 patients. Good-risk (GR) genetic features included ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, normal copy-number status for all 8 genes, isolated deletions affecting ETV6/PAX5/BTG1, and ETV6 deletions with a single additional deletion of BTG1/PAX5/CDKN2A/B. All other genetic features were classified as poor risk (PR). Three-quarters of UKALL2003 patients had a GR genetic profile and a significantly improved event-free survival (EFS) (94%) compared with patients with a PR genetic profile (79%). This difference was driven by a lower relapse rate (4% vs 17%), was seen across all patient subgroups, and was independent of other risk factors. Even genetic GR patients with minimal residual disease (>0.01%) at day 29 had an EFS in excess of 90%. In conclusion, the integration of genomic and cytogenetic data defines 2 subgroups with distinct responses to treatment and identifies a large subset of children suitable for treatment deintensification.((PMID:24648275))Little is known about childhood ALL in the Middle East. This study was undertaken by MECCA as initial efforts in collaborative data collection to provide clinical and demographic information on children with ALL in the Middle East.Clinical and laboratory data for patients with ALL between January 2008 and April 2012 were prospectively collected from institutions in 14 Middle East countries and entered into a custom-built-database during induction phase. All laboratory studies including cytogenetics were done at local institutions.The 1,171 voluntarily enrolled patients had a mean age of 6.1 ± 3.9 years and 59.2% were boys. T-ALL represented 14.8% and 84.2% had B-precursor ALL. At diagnosis, 5.6% had CNS disease. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities reflected a similar percentage of hyperdiploidy (25.6%), but a lower percentage of ETV6-RUNX1 translocation (14.7%) compared to large series reported from Western populations. By clinical criteria, 47.1% were low/standard risk, 16.9% were intermediate risk, and 36% were high risk. Most patients received all their care at the same unit (96.9%). Patients had excellent induction response to chemotherapy with an overall complete remission rate of 96%. Induction toxicities were acceptable.This first collaborative study has established a process for prospective data collection and future multinational collaborative research in the Middle East. Despite the limitations of an incomplete population-based study, it provides the first comprehensive baseline data on clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation, induction outcome, and toxicity. Further work is planned to uncover possible biologic differences of ALL in the region and to improve diagnosis and management.((PMID:24374719))TLS/FUS-ERG chimeric fusion transcript resulting from translocation changes involving chromosomes 16 and 21 is a rare genetic event associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The distinct t(16;21) AML subtype exhibits unique clinical and morphological features and is associated with poor prognosis and a high relapse rate; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. Recently, whole-genome sequencing revealed a large set of genetic alterations that may be relevant for the dynamic clonal evolution and relapse pathogenesis of AML. Here, we report three pediatric AML patients with t(16;21) (p11; q22). The TLS/FUS-ERG fusion transcript was detected in all diagnostic and relapsed samples, with the exception of one relapsed sample. We searched for several genetic lesions, such as RUNX1, FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TP53, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1/2, and DNMT3A, in primary and relapsed AML samples. Interestingly, we found RUNX1 mutation in relapsed sample of one patient in whom cytogenetic analysis showed the emergence of a new additional clone. Otherwise, there were no genetic alterations in FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TP53, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1/2, or DNMT3A. Our results suggest that precedent genetic alterations may be essential to drive the progression and relapse of t(16;21)-AML patients.((PMID:24316076))Mammalian pain-related sensory neurons are derived from TrkA lineage neurons located in the dorsal root ganglion. These neurons project to peripheral targets throughout the body, which can be divided into superficial and deep tissues. Here, we find that the transcription factor Runx1 is required for the development of many epidermis-projecting TrkA lineage neurons. Accordingly, knockout of Runx1 leads to the selective loss of sensory innervation to the epidermis, whereas deep tissue innervation and two types of deep tissue pain are unaffected. Within these cutaneous neurons, Runx1 suppresses a large molecular program normally associated with sensory neurons that innervate deep tissues, such as muscle and visceral organs. Ectopic expression of Runx1 in these deep sensory neurons causes a loss of this molecular program and marked deficits in deep tissue pain. Thus, this study provides insight into a genetic program controlling the segregation of cutaneous versus deep tissue pain pathways.((PMID:24240679))Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as chronic myelogenous (CML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML) are frequently induced by tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Although these MPNs are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, patients often relapse upon withdrawal of therapy. We used a model of MPN, which is induced by co-expression of the oncoproteins HIP1/PDGFβR (H/P) and AML1/ETO from their endogenous loci, to examine the mechanisms of disease development and recurrence following imatinib withdrawal. Although the MPN displayed a full hematologic response to imatinib, 100% of the diseased mice relapsed upon drug withdrawal. MPN persistence was not due to imatinib resistance mutations in the H/P oncogene or massive gene expression changes. Within 1 week of imatinib treatment, more than 98% of gene expression changes induced by the oncogenes in isolated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) immunophenotype) normalized. Supplementation of imatinib with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or arsenic trioxide reduced MPN-initiating cell frequencies and the combination of imatinib with arsenic trioxide cured a large fraction of mice with MPNs. In contrast, no mice in the imatinib-treated control cohorts were cured. These data suggest that treatment with a combination of arsenic trioxide and imatinib can eliminate refractory MPN-initiating cells and reduce disease relapse.((PMID:23715539))Hematopoiesis - the process by which blood cells are formed - has been studied intensely for over a century using a variety of model systems. There is conservation of the overall hematopoietic process between vertebrates, although some differences do exist. Over the last decade, the zebrafish has come to the forefront as a new model in hematopoiesis research, as it allows the use of large-scale genetics, chemical screens and transgenics. This comparative approach to understanding hematopoiesis has led to fundamental knowledge about the process and to the development of new therapies for disease. Here, we provide a broad overview of vertebrate hematopoiesis. We also highlight the benefits of using zebrafish as a model.((PMID:23639725))Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3; FRAGILIS; MIL-1) is part of a larger family of important small interferon-induced transmembrane genes and proteins involved in early development, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation, and which also play a major role in response to bacterial and viral infections and, more recently, in pronounced malignancies. IFITM3, together with tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), PRDM1, and STELLA, has been claimed to be a hallmark of segregated primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Saitou et al., 2002). However, whether IFITM3, like STELLA, is part of a broader stem/progenitor pool that builds the posterior region of the mouse conceptus (Mikedis and Downs, 2012) is obscure. To discover the whereabouts of IFITM3 during mouse gastrulation (~E6.5-9.0), systematic immunohistochemical analysis was carried out at closely spaced 2-4-h intervals. Results revealed diverse, yet consistent, profiles of IFITM3 localization throughout the gastrula. Within the putative PGC trajectory and surrounding posterior tissues, IFITM3 localized as a large cytoplasmic spot with or without staining in the plasma membrane. IFITM3, like STELLA, was also found in the ventral ectodermal ridge (VER), a posterior progenitor pool that builds the tailbud. The large cytoplasmic spot with plasma membrane staining was exclusive to the posterior region; the visceral yolk sac, non-posterior tissues, and epithelial tissues exhibited spots of IFITM3 without cell surface staining. Colocalization of the intracellular IFITM3 spot with the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or endolysosomes was not observed. That relatively high levels of IFITM3 were found throughout the posterior primitive streak and its derivatives is consistent with evidence that IFITM3, like STELLA, is part of a larger stem/progenitor cell pool at the posterior end of the primitive streak that forms the base of the allantois and builds the fetal-umbilical connection, thus further obfuscating practical phenotypic distinctions between so-called PGCs and surrounding soma.((PMID:23325226))VGLUT3-expressing unmyelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) are proposed to mediate pleasant touch and/or pain, but the molecular programs controlling C-LTMR development are unknown. Here, we performed genetic fate mapping, showing that VGLUT3 lineage sensory neurons are divided into two groups, based on transient or persistent VGLUT3 expression. VGLUT3-transient neurons are large- or medium-diameter myelinated mechanoreceptors that form the Merkel cell-neurite complex. VGLUT3-persistent neurons are small-diameter unmyelinated neurons that are further divided into two subtypes: (1) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive C-LTMRs that form the longitudinal lanceolate endings around hairs, and (2) TH-negative neurons that form epidermal-free nerve endings. We then found that VGLUT3-persistent neurons express the runt domain transcription factor Runx1. Analyses of mice with a conditional knock-out of Runx1 in VGLUT3 lineage neurons demonstrate that Runx1 is pivotal to the development of VGLUT3-persistent neurons, such as the expression of VGLUT3 and TH and the formation of the longitudinal lanceolate endings. Furthermore, Runx1 is required to establish mechanosensitivity in C-LTMRs, by controlling the expression of the mechanically gated ion channel Piezo2. Surprisingly, both acute and chronic mechanical pain was largely unaffected in these Runx1 mutants. These findings appear to argue against the recently proposed role of VGLUT3 in C-LTMRs in mediating mechanical hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury or inflammation. Thus, our studies provide new insight into the genetic program controlling C-LTMR development and call for a revisit for the physiological functions of C-LTMRs.((PMID:27288520))The clinical and prognostic relevance of many recently identified driver gene mutations in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly defined. We sequenced the coding regions or hotspot areas of 68 recurrently mutated genes in a cohort of 664 patients aged 18 to 86 years treated on 2 phase 3 trials of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG). The median number of 4 mutations per patient varied according to cytogenetic subgroup, age, and history of previous hematologic disorder or antineoplastic therapy. We found patterns of significantly comutated driver genes suggesting functional synergism. Conversely, we identified 8 virtually nonoverlapping patient subgroups, jointly comprising 78% of AML patients, that are defined by mutually exclusive genetic alterations. These subgroups, likely representing distinct underlying pathways of leukemogenesis, show widely divergent outcomes. Furthermore, we provide detailed information on associations between gene mutations, clinical patient characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes in this large cohort of uniformly treated AML patients. In multivariate analyses including a comprehensive set of molecular and clinical variables, we identified DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutations as important predictors of shorter overall survival (OS) in AML patients <60 years, and particularly in those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD, mutated TP53, and biallelic CEBPA mutations were identified as important molecular prognosticators of OS irrespective of patient age. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the spectrum, clinical associations, and prognostic relevance of recurrent driver gene mutations in a large cohort representing a broad spectrum and age range of intensively treated AML patients.((PMID:27196599))Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive malignancy and the major histological subtype of oesophageal cancer. Although recent large-scale genomic analysis has improved the description of the genetic abnormalities of OSCC, few targetable genomic lesions have been identified, and no molecular therapy is available. This study aims to identify druggable candidates in this tumour.High-throughput small-molecule inhibitor screening was performed to identify potent anti-OSCC compounds. Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) were conducted to decipher the mechanisms of action of CDK7 inhibition in OSCC. A variety of in vitro and in vivo cellular assays were performed to determine the effects of candidate genes on OSCC malignant phenotypes.The unbiased high-throughput small-molecule inhibitor screening led us to discover a highly potent anti-OSCC compound, THZ1, a specific CDK7 inhibitor. RNA-Seq revealed that low-dose THZ1 treatment caused selective inhibition of a number of oncogenic transcripts. Notably, further characterisation of the genomic features of these THZ1-sensitive transcripts demonstrated that they were frequently associated with super-enhancer (SE). Moreover, SE analysis alone uncovered many OSCC lineage-specific master regulators. Finally, integrative analysis of both THZ1-sensitive and SE-associated transcripts identified a number of novel OSCC oncogenes, including PAK4, RUNX1, DNAJB1, SREBF2 and YAP1, with PAK4 being a potential druggable kinase.Our integrative approaches led to a catalogue of SE-associated master regulators and oncogenic transcripts, which may significantly promote both the understanding of OSCC biology and the development of more innovative therapies.((PMID:26868307))Invertebrates rely on the efficient innate immune mechanisms against invaders, in which the continuous production of hemocytes (hematopoiesis) is indispensable. In the present study, the hematopoietic tissue (HPT) from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis was identified and characterized. It was a thin and non-transparent sheet located at the dorsolateral side of the stomach, which was composed of a series of ovoid lobules. Each lobule was surrounded by connective tissue containing a large amount of spherical cells with big nucleus. In HPT, the cells were full of mitochondria and granules, and DNA replication was detected in some cells by EdU labeling technique. Cell proliferation was observed in HPT by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The distribution of two transcription factors, GATA1 and RUNX1, were examined by human GATA1 and RUNX1 antibodies, respectively. Three homologues of RUNX1 were detected in the HPT while no signal of RUNX1 was observed in hemocytes, and GATA1 was detected in both HPT and some hemocytes. The mRNA transcript of a novel hematopoiesis related cytokine EsAst was detected in hepatopancreas and hemocytes, but it was no detectable in HPT. The mRNA expression level of EsAst in hepatopancreas was 1.38-fold higher than that in hemocytes. Total hemocytes counts were related to the mRNA expression level of EsAst post Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The results suggested that the stem cells in the hematopoietic tissue of Chinese mitten crab E. sinensis were regulated by transcriptional and humoral factors to generate hemocytes.((PMID:26721895))Familial acute myeloid leukemia is rare and linked to germline mutations in RUNX1, GATA2 or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEBPA). We re-evaluated a large family with acute myeloid leukemia originally seen at NIH in 1969. We used whole exome sequencing to study this family, and conducted in silico bioinformatics analysis, protein structural modeling and laboratory experiments to assess the impact of the identified CEBPA Q311P mutation. Unlike most previously identified germline mutations in CEBPA, which were N-terminal frameshift mutations, we identified a novel Q311P variant that was located in the C-terminal bZip domain of C/EBPα. Protein structural modeling suggested that the Q311P mutation alters the ability of the CEBPA dimer to bind DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the Q311P mu-tant had attenuated binding to DNA, as predicted by the protein modeling. Consistent with these findings, we found that the Q311P mutation has reduced transactivation, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. From 45 years of follow up, we observed incomplete penetrance (46%) of CEBPA Q311P. This study of a large multi-generational pedigree reveals that a germline mutation in the C-terminal bZip domain can alter the ability of C/EBP-α to bind DNA and reduces transactivation, leading to acute myeloid leukemia.((PMID:26476543))In the last decade, a number of genes have been reported to be recurrently associated with myeloid malignancies. While some mutations are easily detectable by conventional molecular genetics methods, other mutations are more difficult to screen because of lower frequency and being scattered along large genomic ranges. However, newly developed approaches for next-generation sequencing provide an affordable solution for targeted multiplex resequencing of up to several hundreds of amplicons. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a novel custom panel for targeted resequencing of myeloid malignancy samples using the Ion PGM(™) System (Ion Torrent, Paisley, UK).We designed a pool of 424 primers for the amplification of 212 amplicons covering 99.46 % of the exonic regions of nine human genes as follows: ASXL1, EZH2, CALR, RUNX1, SETBP1, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, and U2AF1. Initial testing of the panel performance was performed on an Ion PGM(™) machine using PGM(™) 316 v2 chips on 16 DNA samples from patients with myeloid malignancies. Sequence alignment, variant calling, and annotation were performed using Ion Reporter software.We identified a total of 14 nonsynonymous somatic coding variants in seven samples affecting six of the genes in the panel (ASXL1, CALR, RUNX1, SRSF2, TET2, and U2AF1). Notably, three of the identified mutations were not present in the Cosmic v.67 release.This proof-of-concept study confirms the feasibility of Ion Torrent systems for resequencing of clinically relevant mutations in myeloid malignancies. It can be particularly useful in cases without the most frequent clonal markers.((PMID:26164464))The inherited platelet disorders have witnessed a surge in our understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease in the past few years due in large to part to the introduction of next-generation sequencing for discovery of novel genes. The purpose of this review is to update the reader on the novel discoveries with regard to the inherited platelet disorders, with a particular focus on describing the novel disorders described most recently.The description of novel mechanisms of disease including mutations in PRKACG, in a family with severe macrothrombocytopenia, RUNX1 and FLI1 mutations in patients with inherited mild platelet function disorders and CalDAG-GEFI resulting in a severe platelet bleeding phenotype show that there is still much to be learned from studying families and molecular sequencing of patients with well phenotyped platelet disorders.The implications for clinical practice of the continually growing list of genes described in small numbers of families makes whole exome/genome tempting as an option for evaluation of patients, but use outside of the research setting still needs to be done with extreme caution as interpretation of variants is likely to require additional studies.((PMID:25721735))The NFE2 transcription factor was identified over 25 years ago. The NFE2 protein forms heterodimers with small MAF proteins, and the resulting complex binds to regulatory elements in a large number of target genes. In contrast to other CNC transcription family members including NFE2L1 (NRF1), NFE2L2 (NRF2) and NFE2L3 (NRF3), which are widely expressed, earlier studies had suggested that the major sites of NFE2 expression are hematopoietic cells. Based on cell culture studies it was proposed that this protein acts as a critical regulator of globin gene expression. However, the knockout mouse model displayed only mild erythroid abnormalities, while the major phenotype was a defect in megakaryocyte biogenesis. Indeed, absence of NFE2 led to severely impaired platelet production. A series of recent data, also summarized here, shed new light on the various functional roles of NFE2 and the regulation of its activity. NFE2 is part of a complex regulatory network, including transcription factors such as GATA1 and RUNX1, controlling megakaryocytic and/or erythroid cell function. Surprisingly, it was recently found that NFE2 also has a role in non-hematopoietic tissues, such as the trophoblast, in which it is also expressed, as well as the bone, opening the door to new research areas for this transcription factor. Additional data showed that NFE2 function is controlled by a series of posttranslational modifications. Important strides have been made with respect to the clinical significance of NFE2, linking this transcription factor to hematological disorders such as polycythemias.((PMID:25394790))In certain human cancers, the expression of critical oncogenes is driven from large regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, that recruit much of the cell's transcriptional apparatus and are defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac). In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself. Additionally, most endogenous super-enhancers found in T-ALL cells are occupied by MYB and CBP, which suggests a general role for MYB in super-enhancer initiation. Thus, this study identifies a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of oncogenic super-enhancers in malignant cells.((PMID:26710610))Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonizing roots have been increasingly investigated by molecular approaches with AMF-specific PCR primers. However, it is difficult to compare the species diversity and species compositions of AMF communities across various studies due to the PCR primers used differently, and also little is known if significant difference of community compositions is characterized by different primers. We aim to compare the difference of efficiency of four primers for AMF.We chose four commonly used AMF-specific primer combinations (NS31-AM1, AMLl-AML2, NS31-AML2 and SSUmCf-LSUmBr), and used 18S rDNA clone libraries to describe the AMF diversity and community.Our results showed that the specificity and coverage varied among the tested primers, different primer combinations would yield distinct patterns of species diversity and composition of AMF community. SSUmCf-LSUmBr had the best specificity and coverage in amplifying AMF sequences, followed by NS31-AML2 and NS31-AM1, and AML1-AML2 showed the lowest specificity towards AMF sequences.SSUmCf-LSUmBr is not the optimal primer pair for AMF community study in current stage due to limited reference sequences and large DNA size. As an alternative, NS31-AML2 is more suitable in AMF community study, because its target rDNA region could well match the increasingly used virtual taxonomy database (http://maarjam. botany.ut.ee) and also its suitable DNA size could be efficiently used in high-throughput sequencing.((PMID:25886910))DNA methylation is tightly regulated throughout mammalian development, and altered DNA methylation patterns are a general hallmark of cancer. The methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 is frequently mutated in hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and has been suggested to protect CG dinucleotide (CpG) islands and promoters from aberrant DNA methylation. In this study, we present a novel Tet2-dependent leukemia mouse model that closely recapitulates gene expression profiles and hallmarks of human AML1-ETO-induced AML. Using this model, we show that the primary effect of Tet2 loss in preleukemic hematopoietic cells is progressive and widespread DNA hypermethylation affecting up to 25% of active enhancer elements. In contrast, CpG island and promoter methylation does not change in a Tet2-dependent manner but increases relative to population doublings. We confirmed this specific enhancer hypermethylation phenotype in human AML patients with TET2 mutations. Analysis of immediate gene expression changes reveals rapid deregulation of a large number of genes implicated in tumorigenesis, including many down-regulated tumor suppressor genes. Hence, we propose that TET2 prevents leukemic transformation by protecting enhancers from aberrant DNA methylation and that it is the combined silencing of several tumor suppressor genes in TET2 mutated hematopoietic cells that contributes to increased stem cell proliferation and leukemogenesis.((PMID:22289984))The AML1-ETO fusion protein, which is present in 10-15% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, is known to repress myeloid differentiation genes through DNA binding and recruitment of chromatin-modifying proteins and transcription factors in target genes. ChIP-chip analysis of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with the AML1-ETO fusion gene enabled us to identify 1168 AML1-ETO target genes, 103 of which were co-occupied by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and had lost the hyperacetylation mark at histone H4, and 264 showed a K9 trimethylation at histone H3. Enrichment of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation and in specific signaling pathways was observed in the presence of these epigenetic modifications associated with an 'inactive' chromatin status. Furthermore, AML1-ETO target genes had a significant correlation between the chromatin marks studied and transcriptional silencing. Interestingly, AML1 binding sites were absent on a large number of selected AML1-ETO promoters and an Sp1 binding site was found in over 50% of them. Reversible silencing induced by the fusion protein in the presence of AML1 and/or Sp1 transcription factor binding site was confirmed. Therefore, this study provides a global analysis of AML1-ETO functional chromatin modifications and identifies the important role of Sp1 in the DNA binding pattern of AML1-ETO, suggesting a role for Sp1-targeted therapy in this leukemia subtype.((PMID:22217495))Several large biobanks comprising umbilical cord blood samples have been established allowing efforts to characterize the prevalence and risk factors for preleukemic cell clones in healthy newborns. This study explores the feasibility of demonstrating translocation ETV6-RUNX1 transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in newborns enrolled in a large Danish National Birth Cohort.The study emphasizes the necessity of either storing viable cord blood cells or preparation of the RNA within 1 to 2 days of birth, in large scale studies of the natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, the estimated frequency of translocation ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells was below 10.((PMID:21729552))In order to investigate the epidemiology of childhood acute leukemia (CAL), such as onset age and time, risk factor, subtypes distribution and genetics, 1236 CAL patients admitted in blood disease hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for treatment from April 2004 to April 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. The results showed that the sex ratio of ALL and AML patients were 1.80:1 and 1.73:1 respectively; the average peak age of incidence lasted from 2 to 6 years with the median age of 6 years, while the ALL peak age of incidence lasted from 2 to 5 years but AML showed no significant peak age of incidence. Winter, especially January was the peak time for both onset and birth. Among all the 631 ALL patients who had already been immunophenotyped, B-ALL patients accounted for 83%, T-ALL patients accounted for 9%. Among 361 AML patients, sub-leukemia phenotype from M(0) to M(7) accounted for 0.3%, 2.2%, 29.8%, 20.9%, 8.1%, 25.2%, 4.1% and 4.6% respectively. Among 631 pediatric ALL patients who had been examined by using molecular biology technique, the positive rate of TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, MLL and E2A/PBX1 were 23%, 7.4%, 4.1%, 2.1% respectively. Among 361 pediatric AML patients who had been examined by using molecular biology technique, 19% of the patients showed positive AML1/ETO fusion gene, 18% of the patients showed positive PML/RARα fusion gene, while 4.2% of patients showed positive CBFβ/MYH11. It is concluded that the onset of pediatric acute leukemia is influenced by age, season, environment and different genetic background.((PMID:21505102))Fusion oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) promote self-renewal from committed progenitors, thereby linking transformation and self-renewal pathways. Like most cancers, AML is a genetically and biologically heterogeneous disease, but it is unclear whether transformation results from common or overlapping genetic programs acting downstream of multiple mutations or by the engagement of unique genetic programs acting cooperatively downstream of individual mutations. This distinction is important, because the involvement of common programs would imply the existence of common molecular targets to treat AML, no matter which oncogenes are involved. Here we show that the ability to promote self-renewal is a generalized property of leukemia-associated oncogenes. Disparate oncogenes initiated overlapping transformation and self-renewal gene expression programs, the common elements of which were defined in established leukemic stem cells from an animal model as well as from a large cohort of patients with differing AML subtypes, where they strongly predicted pathobiological character. Notably, individual genes commonly activated in these programs could partially phenocopy the self-renewal function of leukemia-associated oncogenes in committed murine progenitors. Furthermore, they could generate AML following expression in murine bone marrow. In summary, our findings reveal the operation of common programs of self-renewal and transformation downstream of leukemia-associated oncogenes, suggesting that mechanistically common therapeutic approaches to AML are likely to be possible, regardless of the identity of the driver oncogene involved.((PMID:21459790))LMO2 is highly expressed at the most immature stages of lymphopoiesis. In T-lymphocytes, aberrant LMO2 expression beyond those stages leads to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while in B cells LMO2 is also expressed in germinal center lymphocytes and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, where it predicts better clinical outcome. The implication of LMO2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia must still be explored.We measured LMO2 expression by real time RT-PCR in 247 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples with cytogenetic data (144 of them also with survival and immunophenotypical data) and in normal hematopoietic and lymphoid cells.B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases expressed variable levels of LMO2 depending on immunophenotypical and cytogenetic features. Thus, the most immature subtype, pro-B cells, displayed three-fold higher LMO2 expression than pre-B cells, common-CD10+ or mature subtypes. Additionally, cases with TEL-AML1 or MLL rearrangements exhibited two-fold higher LMO2 expression compared to cases with BCR-ABL rearrangements or hyperdyploid karyotype. Clinically, high LMO2 expression correlated with better overall survival in adult patients (5-year survival rate 64.8% (42.5%-87.1%) vs. 25.8% (10.9%-40.7%), P= 0.001) and constituted a favorable independent prognostic factor in B-ALL with normal karyotype: 5-year survival rate 80.3% (66.4%-94.2%) vs. 63.0% (46.1%-79.9%) (P= 0.043).Our data indicate that LMO2 expression depends on the molecular features and the differentiation stage of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Furthermore, assessment of LMO2 expression in adult patients with a normal karyotype, a group which lacks molecular prognostic factors, could be of clinical relevance.((PMID:21447743))VEGFA is considered one of the most important regulators of tumor-associated angiogenesis in cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) VEGFA is an independent prognostic factor for reduced overall and relapse-free survival. Transcriptional activation of the VEGFA promoter, a core mechanism for VEGFA regulation, has not been fully elucidated. We found a significant (P < 0.0001) inverse correlation between expression of VEGFA and AML1/RUNX1 in a large set of gene expression array data. Strikingly, highest VEGFA levels were demonstrated in AML blasts containing a t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1/RUNX1 protein (AML1/ETO). Overexpression of AML1/RUNX1 led to downregulation of VEGFA expression, whereas blocking of AML1/RUNX1 with siRNAs resulted in increased VEGFA expression. Cotransfection of AML1/RUNX1 and VEGFA promoter luciferase promoter constructs resulted in a decrease in VEGFA promoter activity. ChIP analysis shows a direct binding of AML1/RUNX1 to the promoter of VEGFA on three AML1/RUNX1 binding sites. Silencing of AML1/ETO caused a decrease in VEGFA mRNA expression and a decrease in secreted VEGFA protein levels in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells. Taken together, these data pinpoint to a model whereby in normal cells AML1/RUNX1 acts as a repressor for VEGFA, while in AML cells VEGFA expression is upregulated due to AML1/RUNX1 aberrations, for example, AML1/ETO. In conclusion, these observations give insight in the regulation of VEGFA at the mRNA level in AML.((PMID:21302608))Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is the prototypic member of a large family of structurally related pleiotropic-secreted cytokines. The TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway usually participates in a wide range of cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Upon binding on TGF-beta1, the dimerized TGF-beta type II receptors recruit and phosphorylate the TGF-beta type I receptors, which phosphorylate the receptor-regulated SMAD (SMAD2 and SMAD3) presented by the SMAD anchor for receptor activation. The phosphorylated receptor-regulated SMAD form heterologous complexes with the common-mediator SMAD (SMAD4) and subsequently translocate into the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes. This multi-functional signaling pathway modulated by various elements with complex mechanisms at different levels is also inevitably involved in cancer. We herein present data on the role of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway in human chronic myeloid leukemia and explain the potent biological effects of TGF-beta1 on leukemia cells. The paper is based on a review of articles selected from Cancerline and Medline data bases. The constitutively active tyrosine kinase produced by the specific Bcr-Abl fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome can enhance the resistance of malignant cells to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, which contributes to enhancement of proteasomal degradation of p27. However, overexpression of the EVI1 gene, which is also caused by Bcr-Abl, can recruit the C-terminal binding protein and histone deacetylase to prevent the MH2 domain on SMAD3. The later is essential for transcription activation on target genes and leads to blockage of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway. Some studies have indicated that certain therapeutic agents applied in clinical treatment can inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation of leukemia cells by way of modulation of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signal pathway. For example, arsenic trioxide can promote specific degradation of the AML1/MDS1/EVI1 oncoprotein and inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells. However, specific histone deacetylase inhibitors can interrupt the effect of histone deacetylase to alleviate EVI1-mediated suppression of TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the target therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia can effectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl and induce suppression on the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway. The TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway plays an important role in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and leads the leukemia cells to growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis. The positive influence of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia is fairly significant, and its potential effects in clinical treatment will bring about definite benefits. Since it is a complex signaling pathway widely involved in many aspects of cellular activities, further study and comprehensive analysis of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway are imperative and will have a guiding significance in research and clinical applications. It is an exciting area for future research.((PMID:21135260))The Graffi murine leukemia virus induces a large spectrum of leukemias in mice and thus provides a good model to compare the transcriptome of all types of leukemias. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of both T and B leukemias induced by the virus with DNA microarrays. Given that we considered that a 4-fold change in expression level was significant, 388 probe sets were associated to B, to T, or common to both leukemias. Several of them were not yet associated with lymphoid leukemia. We confirmed specific deregulation of Fmn2, Arntl2, Bfsp2, Gfra2, Gpm6a, and Gpm6b in B leukemia, of Nln, Fbln1, and Bmp7 in T leukemias, and of Etv5 in both leukemias. More importantly, we show that the mouse Fmn2 induced an anchorage-independent growth, a drastic modification in cell shape with a concomitant disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, we found that human FMN2 is overexpressed in approximately 95% of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the highest expression levels in patients with a TEL/AML1 rearrangement. These results, surely related to the role of FMN2 in meiotic spindle maintenance, suggest its important role in leukemogenesis. Finally, we propose a new panel of genes potentially involved in T and/or B leukemias.((PMID:20513752))The ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene, present in 25% of B-lineage childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is thought to represent an initiating event, which requires additional genetic changes for leukemia development. To identify additional genetic alterations, 24 ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALLs were analyzed using 500K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The results were combined with previously published data sets, allowing us to ascertain genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 164 cases. In total, 45 recurrent CNAs were identified with an average number of 3.5 recurrent changes per case (range 0-13). Twenty-six percent of cases displayed a set of recurrent CNAs identical to that of other cases in the data set. The majority (74%), however, displayed a unique pattern of recurrent CNAs, indicating a large heterogeneity within this ALL subtype. As previously demonstrated, alterations targeting genes involved in B-cell development were common (present in 28% of cases). However, the combined analysis also identified alterations affecting nuclear hormone response (24%) to be a characteristic feature of ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL. Studying the correlation pattern of the CNAs allowed us to highlight significant positive and negative correlations between specific aberrations. Furthermore, oncogenetic tree models identified ETV6, CDKN2A/B, PAX5, del(6q) and +16 as possible early events in the leukemogenic process.((PMID:19494111))Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) regulates essential cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins has been implicated as mediators of TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that TGFbeta induces the expression of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a member of the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, to induce cell death in B-lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of TGFbeta-mediated Bim expression in two hepatocyte cell lines that undergo apoptosis with TGFbeta, AML-12 and Hep3B. We show that TGFbeta induces Bim protein and mRNA levels, and its expression is sufficient to induce cell death. Gene array results revealed that Runx1, a member of the Runx family of transcription factors, was induced by TGFbeta, and this induction was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, TGFbeta specifically induced the expression of Runx1 protein from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent, cap-independent, mRNA transcript, and its overexpression was sufficient to induce hepatocyte apo pto sis. Deletion and mutation analyses of the murine Bim promoter identified a putative forkhead binding element, at position -174 to -168 from the transcription start site, as the mediator of Runx1 induction. Co-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Runx1 does not bind directly to the identified forkhead binding element but rather binds the transcriptional regulator FOXO3, which occupies this site. Finally, small interfering RNA knockdown of Runx1 or FOXO3 decreased TGFbeta-induced Bim expression. Our results support a mechanism in which TGFbeta stimulates Bim transcription by up-regulating Runx1 expression, which binds FOXO3, and the two cooperate in the transcriptional induction of Bim.((PMID:7969143))Although most skeletal muscle genes are expressed at similar levels in electrically active, innervated muscle and in electrically inactive, denervated muscle, a small number of genes, including those encoding the acetylcholine receptor, N-CAM, and myogenin, are expressed at significantly higher levels in denervated than in innervated muscle. The mechanisms that mediate electrical activity-dependent gene regulation are not understood, but these mechanisms are likely to be responsible, at least in part, for the changes in muscle structure and function that accompany a decrease in myofiber electrical activity. To understand how muscle activity regulates muscle structure and function, we used a subtractive-hybridization and cloning strategy to identify and isolate genes that are expressed preferentially in innervated or denervated muscle. One of the genes which we found to be regulated by electrical activity is the recently discovered acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) gene. Disruption and translocation of the human AML1 gene are responsible for a form of acute myeloid leukemia. AML1 is a DNA-binding protein, but its normal function is not known and its expression and regulation in skeletal muscle were not previously appreciated. Because of its potential role as a transcriptional mediator of electrical activity, we characterized expression of the AML1 gene in innervated, denervated, and developing skeletal muscle. We show that AML1 is expressed at low levels in innervated skeletal muscle and at 50- to 100-fold-higher levels in denervated muscle. Four AML1 transcripts are expressed in denervated muscle, and the abundance of each transcript increases after denervation. We transfected C2 muscle cells with an expression vector encoding AML1, tagged with an epitope from hemagglutinin, and we show that AML1 is a nuclear protein in muscle. AML1 dimerizes with core-binding factor beta (CBF beta), and we show that CGF beta is expressed at high levels in both innervated and denervated skeletal muscle. PEBP2 alpha, which is structurally related to AML1 and which also dimerizes with CBF beta, is expressed at low levels in skeletal muscle and is up-regulated only weakly by denervation. These results are consistent with the idea that AML1 may have a role in regulating gene expression in skeletal muscle.((PMID:23537631))Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are produced by a small cohort of hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) during development through the formation of intra-aortic hematopoietic cell (HC) clusters. The Runx1 transcription factor plays a key role in the EC-to-HC and -HSC transition. We show that Runx1 expression in hemogenic ECs and the subsequent initiation of HC formation are tightly controlled by the subaortic mesenchyme, although the mesenchyme is not a source of HCs. Runx1 and Notch signaling are involved in this process, with Notch signaling decreasing with time in HCs. Inhibiting Notch signaling readily increases HC production in mouse and chicken embryos. In the mouse, however, this increase is transient. Collectively, we show complementary roles of hemogenic ECs and mesenchymal compartments in triggering aortic hematopoiesis. The subaortic mesenchyme induces Runx1 expression in hemogenic-primed ECs and collaborates with Notch dynamics to control aortic hematopoiesis.((PMID:23932235))The embryonic dorsal aorta plays a pivotal role in the production of the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the founders of the adult hematopoietic system. HSC production is polarized by being restricted to the aortic floor where a specialized subset of endothelial cells (ECs) endowed with hemogenic properties undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic production resulting in the formation of the intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters. This production is tightly time- and space-controlled with the transcription factor Runx1 playing a key role in this process and the surrounding tissues controlling the aortic shape and fate. In this paper, we shall review (a) how hemogenic ECs differentiate from the mesoderm, (b) how the different aortic components assemble coordinately to establish the dorso-ventral polarity, and (c) how this results in the initiation of Runx1 expression in hemogenic ECs and the initiation of the hematopoietic program. These observations should elucidate the first steps in HSC commitment and help in developing techniques to manipulate adult HSCs.((PMID:22305260))Vascular calcification is an active deposition process of calcium phosphate which resembles bone formation and is highly regulated by osteoblast-like cells. Existing studies demonstrate that advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may play a pathogenic role in the vascular calcification process. However, their mechanism remains poorly understood. The aim of our current study is to investigate how non-cross-link and non-fluorescent N(ε)-carboxymethyl-Lysine (CML), a major immunogen of AGEs, affect the progression of atherosclerotic calcification in diabetes.The present study consisted of an in vivo investigation and two in vitro investigations. In study I, male apoE(-/-) mice were first rendered diabetic by the administration of 5 daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg), and then given a semi-synthetic high-fat diet (HFD) plus daily injections of CML (10mg/kg/day). The mice were euthanized and analyzed at 0 month (group 0M, n = 10), 2 months (group 2M, n = 10), and 4 months (group 4M, n = 10) after the triple administrations of STZ-CML-HFD. In study II, the effects of CML on the apoptosis in macrophages were investigated. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with or without 50 μg/mL oxLDL plus various concentrations of CML for 48 h. In study III, we investigated whether A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells were induced into osteoblast-like phenotypes by incubation with or without 80 μg/mL of RAW264.7-derived-apoptotic bodies and 50 μg/mL of oxLDL plus various concentrations of CML (or high-glucose) for 7 days. Related analyses (i.e., H&E staining, Masson staining, von Kossa staining, TUNEL staining, immunohistochemical staining, calcium content assay, annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining, and Western blot) were performed.Morphological analysis showed that early atherosclerotic plaques appeared 2 months after the triple administrations of STZ-CML-HFD, and that typically advanced plaques with extensive calcification lesions, abundant cholesterol crystals, and proliferative collagen were formed 4 months after the triple administrations of STZ-CML-HFD. Furthermore, CML deposition signals and the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in the aortic wall were mainly restricted in the atherosclerotic plaques. After the incubation of A7r5 smooth muscle cells with 10 μmol/L CML plus 50 μg/mL oxLDL, and 80 μg/mL apoptotic bodies (ABs) for 7 days, semi-quantitative analysis of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), core-binding factor α1 (cbfα1), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression showed 5.0-, 2.0-, and 2.9-fold increases, respectively, compared with those in 50 μg/mL oxLDL and 80 μg/mL ABs. Subsequently, a similar trend was observed in the calcium deposition of the cell layer. However, high-glucose had no effects on the ALP activity and calcium deposition of A7r5 cell layer under high-lipid, apoptosis-coexisting conditions. Both animal and cell studies consistently demonstrated that the CML/RAGE axis may first initiate the apoptosis of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and then induce BMP-2-cbfα1-ALP-calcification cascade in a high-lipid, apoptosis-coexisting environment.The CML/RAGE axis may play an important role in atherosclerotic calcification of diabetes through the mechanism that induces the apoptosis of macrophages followed by the osteogenic differentiation of aortic smooth muscle cells.((PMID:26634964))L-ergothioneine (ET), a putative antioxidant compound acquired by animals through dietary sources, has been suggested to accumulate in certain cells and tissues in the body that are predisposed to high oxidative stress. In the present study, we identified an elevation of ET in the liver of a guinea pig model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), elucidated a possible mechanism for the increased uptake and investigated the possible role for this accumulation. This increase in liver ET levels correlated with cholesterol accumulation and disease severity. We identified an increase in the transcriptional factor, RUNX1, which has been shown to upregulate the expression of the ET-specific transporter OCTN1, and could consequently lead to the observable elevation in ET. An increase was also seen in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) which seemingly corresponds to ET elevation. No significant increase was observed in oxidative damage markers, F2-isoprostanes, and protein carbonyls, which could possibly be attributed to the increase in liver ET through direct antioxidant action, induction of HSP70, or by chelation of Fe(2+), preventing redox chemistry. The data suggest a novel mechanism by which the guinea pig fatty liver accumulates ET via upregulation of its transporter, as a possible stress response by the damaged liver to further suppress oxidative damage and delay tissue injury. Similar events may happen in other animal models of disease, and researchers should be aware of the possibility.((PMID:23239112))The effects of exogenous hormones, used for estrus synchronization and ovarian hyper stimulation, on cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) gene expression in sexually mature rats were determined using microarrays. Gene expression in COCs collected from GnRH (G(trt)), GnRH + eCG (G + E(trt)), and GnRH + eCG + hCG (G + E + H(trt)) treatments were compared to COCs from naturally cycling (NC) rats before the preovulatory luteninizing hormone surge. There was no significant difference in gene expression among NC, G(trt), and G + E(trt); however, over 2,600 genes were significantly different between NC and G + E + H(trt) (P < 0.05). Genes upregulated in G + E + H(trt) encode for: proteins that are involved in prostaglandin synthesis (Ptgs2, Pla2g4a, and Runx1) and cholesterol biosynthesis (Hmgcr, Sc4mol, and Dhcr24); receptors that allow cholesterol uptake (Ldlr and Scarb1), regulate progesterone synthesis (Star), and inactivate estrogen (Sult1e1); and downstream effectors of LH signal (Pgr, Cebpb, Creb3l1, Areg, Ereg, and Adamts1). Conversely, G + E + H(trt) downregulated genes encoding proteins involved in: DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Ccne2, Orc5l, Rad50, and Mcm6); reproductive developmental process; and granulosa cell expansion (Gdf9, Bmp15, Amh, Amhr2, Bmpr1b, Tgfb2, Foxl2, Pde3a, Esr2, Fshr, Ybx2, Ccnd2, Ccnb1ip1, and Zp3); maternal effect genes required for embryo development (Zar1, Npm2, Nlrp5, Dnmt1, H1foo, and Zfp57); amino acid degradation; and ketogenesis (Hmgcs2, and Cpt1b). These results from the rat show that hormones used for estrus synchronization (G(trt)) and ovarian hyper stimulation (G + E(trt)) had minimal effects on gene expression, whereas induction of ovulation (G + E + H(trt)) caused major changes in gene expression of rat COCs. This study provides comprehensive information about regulated genes during late follicle development and ovulation induction.((PMID:24145030))Th17 cells are important effectors of immunity to extracellular pathogens, particularly at mucosal surfaces, but they can also contribute to pathologic tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. Defining the multitude of factors that influence their development is therefore of paramount importance. Our previous studies using Ikaros(-/-) CD4+ T cells implicated Ikaros in Th1 versus Th2 lineage decisions. Here we demonstrate that Ikaros also regulates Th17 differentiation through its ability to promote expression of multiple Th17 lineage-determining genes, including Ahr, Runx1, Rorc, Il17a, and Il22. Ikaros exerts its influence on the chromatin remodeling of these loci at two distinct stages in CD4+ T helper cell development. In naive cells, Ikaros is required to limit repressive chromatin modifications at these gene loci, thus maintaining the potential for expression of the Th17 gene program. Subsequently, Ikaros is essential for the acquisition of permissive histone marks in response to Th17 polarizing signals. Additionally, Ikaros represses the expression of genes that limit Th17 development, including Foxp3 and Tbx21. These data define new targets of the action of Ikaros and indicate that Ikaros plays a critical role in CD4+ T cell differentiation by integrating specific cytokine cues and directing epigenetic modifications that facilitate activation or repression of relevant genes that drive T cell lineage choice.((PMID:21343615))Forced expression of the transcription factor HoxB4 has been shown to enhance the self-renewal capacity of mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and confer a long-term repopulating capacity to yolk sac and embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived hematopoietic precursors. The fact that ES cell-derived precursors do not repopulate bone marrow without HoxB4 underscores an important role for HoxB4 in the maturation of ES-derived hematopoietic precursors into long-term repopulating HSCs. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process is barely understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of HoxB4 using ES cell-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The results revealed many of the genes essential for HSC development to be direct targets of HoxB4, such as Runx1, Scl/Tal1, Gata2, and Gfi1. The expression profiling also showed that HoxB4 indirectly affects the expression of several important genes, such as Lmo2, Erg, Meis1, Pbx1, Nov, AhR, and Hemgn. HoxB4 tended to activate the transcription, but the down-regulation of a significant portion of direct targets suggested its function to be context-dependent. These findings indicate that HoxB4 reprograms a set of key regulator genes to facilitate the maturation of developing HSCs into repopulating cells. Our list of HoxB4 targets also provides novel candidate regulators for HSCs.((PMID:17560011))AML1-ETO fusion protein is a product of chromosome translocation t(8;21) frequently occurred in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its sole expression appears to fail to cause overt leukemia in vivo. In this study, we investigated whether AML1-ETO expression impinged on action of chemical carcinogens-DNA adduct formation.AML1-ETO fusion protein was conditionally induced in engineered U937-A/E 9/14/18 cells. The formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts and the expression of PAH-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were detected by Western blot and/or quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase reporter system was used to detect the regulation of AML1-ETO on CYP1A1 transcription.Our results showed that AML1-ETO induction significantly increased the formation of carcinogen benzopyrene-DNA adducts in leukemic cells. In line with the effect, we also found that AML1-ETO induction upregulated CYP1A1 expression, which was dependent on AML1-binding motif in the promotor of CYP1A1 gene. Additionally, AML1-ETO protein also increased AhR expression, a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates PAHs-induced CYP1A1 gene expression.These data, combined with its inhibitory effect on DNA repair as reported previously, propose that the presence of AML1-ETO increases the susceptibility of cells to chemical carcinogens, which favors the development of additional genetic alterations.((PMID:19285840))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a class of prevalent hematopoietic malignancies, is caused by the acquisition of gene mutations that confer deregulated proliferation, impaired differentiation and a survival advantage of hematopoietic progenitors. More recently, we reported that cobalt chloride (CoCl(2))/iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO)-mimicked hypoxia or moderate hypoxia (2% and 3% O(2)) can directly trigger differentiation of many subtypes of AML cells. Also, intermittent hypoxia significantly prolongs the survival of the transplanted leukemic mice with differentiation induction of leukemic cells. Additionally, these hypoxia-simulating agents selectively stimulate differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemic cells induced by arsenic trioxide, an effective second-line drug for this unique type of leukemia. Based on this interesting evidence in vitro and in vivo, the ongoing investigations showed the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein through its non-transcriptional activity in myeloid cell differentiation, as evidenced by chemical interference, the conditional HIF-1alpha induction, the specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta, an essential partner for transcription activity of HIF-1. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha and two hematopoietic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and Runx1/AML1 interact directly with each other. Such interactions increase the transcriptional activities of C/EBPalpha and Runx1/AML1, while C/EBPalpha competes with HIF-1beta for direct binding to HIF-1alpha protein, and significantly inhibits the DNA-binding ability of HIF-1. As a protein is rapidly responsive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a classical clinical differentiation-inducing drug for AML, HIF-1alpha also plays a role in ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells.((PMID:16467864))AML1/RUNX1 mutations have been reported frequently in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, especially those diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blast (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), or AML following MDS (these categories are defined as MDS/AML). Although AML1 mutations are suspected to play a pivotal role in the development of MDS/AML, acquisition of additional genetic alterations is also necessary. We analyzed gene alterations in MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations, comparing them to alterations in those without an AML1 mutation. AML1 mutations were significantly associated with -7/7q-, whereas MDS/AML patients without AML1 mutations showed a high frequency of -5/5q- and a complex karyotype. Patients with AML1 mutations showed more mutations of their FLT3, N-RAS, PTPN11, and NF1 genes, resulting in a significantly higher mutation frequency for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS signaling pathways in AML1-mutated MDS/AML patients compared to AML1-wild-type MDS/AML patients (38% versus 6.3%, P < 0.0001). Conversely, p53 mutations were detected only in patients without AML1 mutations. Furthermore, blast cells of the AML1-mutated patients expressing surface c-KIT, and SHP-2 mutants contributed to prolonged and enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation following stem cell factor stimulation. Our results suggest that MDS/AML arising from AML1/RUNX1 mutations has a significant association with -7/7q- alteration, and frequently involves RTK-RAS signaling pathway activation.((PMID:14982869))SHP-2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as signal transducer downstream to growth factor and cytokine receptors. SHP-2 is required during development, and germline mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome. SHP-2 plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell development. We recently demonstrated that somatic PTPN11 mutations are the most frequent lesion in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and are observed in a smaller percentage of children with other myeloid malignancies. Here, we report that PTPN11 lesions occur in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Mutations were observed in 23 of 317 B-cell precursor ALL cases, but not among 44 children with T-lineage ALL. In the former, lesions prevalently occurred in TEL-AML1(-) cases with CD19(+)/CD10(+)/cyIgM(-) immunophenotype. PTPN11, NRAS, and KRAS2 mutations were largely mutually exclusive and accounted for one third of common ALL cases. We also show that, among 69 children with acute myeloid leukemia, PTPN11 mutations occurred in 4 of 12 cases with acute monocytic leukemia (FAB-M5). Leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations were missense and were predicted to result in SHP-2 gain-of-function. Our findings provide evidence for a wider role of PTPN11 lesions in leukemogenesis, but also suggest a lineage-related and differentiation stage-related contribution of these lesions to clonal expansion.((PMID:26595813))The DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B are primarily responsible for de novo methylation of specific cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides during mammalian development. While loss-of-function mutations in DNMT3A are highly recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNMT3A mutations are almost never found in AML patients with translocations that create oncogenic fusion genes such as PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and MLL-AF9. Here, we explored how DNMT3A is involved in the function of these fusion genes. We used retroviral vectors to express PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, or MLL-AF9 in bone marrow cells derived from WT or DNMT3A-deficient mice. Additionally, we examined the phenotypes of hematopoietic cells from Ctsg-PML-RARA mice, which express PML-RARA in early hematopoietic progenitors and myeloid precursors, with or without DNMT3A. We determined that the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, is required for aberrant PML-RARA-driven self-renewal ex vivo and that DNMT3A is dispensable for RUNX1-RUNX1T1- and MLL-AF9-driven self-renewal. Furthermore, both the PML-RARA-driven competitive transplantation advantage and development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) required DNMT3A. Together, these findings suggest that PML-RARA requires DNMT3A to initiate APL in mice.((PMID:26594843))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is mostly driven by oncogenic transcription factors, which have been classically viewed as intractable targets using small-molecule inhibitor approaches. Here we demonstrate that AML driven by repressive transcription factors, including AML1-ETO (encoded by the fusion oncogene RUNX1-RUNX1T1) and PML-RARα fusion oncoproteins (encoded by PML-RARA) are extremely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition, in part owing to their suppressed expression of key homologous recombination (HR)-associated genes and their compromised DNA-damage response (DDR). In contrast, leukemia driven by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, encoded by KMT2A) fusions with dominant transactivation ability is proficient in DDR and insensitive to PARP inhibition. Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of an MLL downstream target, HOXA9, which activates expression of various HR-associated genes, impairs DDR and sensitizes MLL leukemia to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Conversely, HOXA9 overexpression confers PARPi resistance to AML1-ETO and PML-RARα transformed cells. Together, these studies describe a potential utility of PARPi-induced synthetic lethality for leukemia treatment and reveal a novel molecular mechanism governing PARPi sensitivity in AML.((PMID:24449212))PML-RARA and AML1-ETO are important oncogenic fusion proteins that play a central role in transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whether these fusion proteins render the tumor cells with immune evasion properties is unknown. Here we show that both oncogenic proteins specifically downregulate the expression of CD48, a ligand of the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor 2B4, thereby leading to decreased killing by NK cells. We demonstrate that this process is histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent, that it is mediated through the downregulation of CD48 messenger RNA, and that treatment with HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) restores the expression of CD48. Furthermore, by using chromatin immunoprecepitation (ChIP) experiments, we show that AML1-ETO directly interacts with CD48. Finally, we show that AML patients who are carrying these specific translocations have low expression of CD48.((PMID:24331925))Delineating the mechanism or mechanisms that regulate the specification of hemogenic endothelial cells from primordial endothelium is critical for optimizing their derivation from human stem cells for clinical therapies. We previously determined that retinoic acid (RA) is required for hemogenic specification, as well as cell-cycle control, of endothelium during embryogenesis. Herein, we define the molecular signals downstream of RA that regulate hemogenic endothelial cell development and demonstrate that cell-cycle control is required for this process. We found that re-expression of c-Kit in RA-deficient (Raldh2(-/-)) primordial endothelium induced Notch signaling and p27 expression, which restored cell-cycle control and rescued hemogenic endothelial cell specification and function. Re-expression of p27 in RA-deficient and Notch-inactivated primordial endothelial cells was sufficient to correct their defects in cell-cycle regulation and hemogenic endothelial cell development. Thus, RA regulation of hemogenic endothelial cell specification requires c-Kit, notch signaling, and p27-mediated cell-cycle control.((PMID:24145192))Both radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs induce autophagy in tumor cells, and whether this contributes to cell death or survival is debated. Although a prodeath role has been reported in certain contexts, treatment-induced autophagy often exerts a prosurvival function by preventing apoptosis and delaying necrosis. Interestingly, a more specific role of autophagy has been demonstrated in certain subtypes of leukemia. The fusion oncoproteins PML-RARA and BCR-ABL, the main oncogenic drivers of acute promyelocytic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), respectively, have recently been identified as autophagy substrates and their degradation by autophagy shown to contribute to treatment. However, this does not seem to be a general feature of leukemic fusion oncoproteins, as we recently found that AML1-ETO, the most frequently occurring acute myeloid leukemia (AML) fusion protein, is not an autophagy substrate. Rather we demonstrate a clear prosurvival role of autophagy in this AML subtype and that addition of autophagy inhibitors in the treatment regimen might be beneficial.((PMID:23970379))The role of autophagy during leukemia treatment is unclear. On the one hand, autophagy might be induced as a prosurvival response to therapy, thereby reducing treatment efficiency. On the other hand, autophagy may contribute to degradation of fusion oncoproteins, as recently demonstrated for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α and breakpoint cluster region-abelson, thereby facilitating leukemia treatment. Here, we investigated these opposing roles of autophagy in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, which express the most frequently occurring AML fusion oncoprotein, AML1-eight-twenty-one (ETO). We demonstrate that autophagy is induced by AML1-ETO-targeting drugs, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) valproic acid (VPA) and vorinostat. Furthermore, we show that autophagy does not mediate degradation of AML1-ETO but rather has a prosurvival role in AML cells, as inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the viability and colony-forming ability of HDACi-treated AML cells. Combined treatment with HDACis and autophagy inhibitors such as chloroquine (CQ) led to a massive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that correlated with increased cell death. Finally, we show that VPA induced autophagy in t(8;21) AML patient cells, and combined treatment with CQ enhanced cell death. Because VPA and CQ are well-tolerated drugs, combinatorial therapy with VPA and CQ could represent an attractive treatment option for AML1-ETO-positive leukemia.((PMID:23826571))((PMID:23319320))Adipose tissue is a potential site of retinoic acid (RA) action, but its physiological significance remains to be clarified. We have examined the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on growth and differentiation of preadipocytes, and on adipokine gene expression in mature adipocytes using human preadipocyte cell model, AML-I. Both ATRA and 9-cis RA induced growth arrest in AML-I preadipocyte at between 50 and 100 µM, which was accompanied by apoptosis. Western blotting showed a loss of NF-κB, Bcl-2 and p-Akt, and the accumulation of Bad and Akt in cytoplasm of ATRA-treated AML-I preadipocytes. Exposure of AML-I to ATRA or 9-cis RA increased intracellular lipid accumulation in a time-dependent manner compared to vehicle-treated cells. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) proteins was increased in ATRA-treated cells. Thus, both ATRA and 9-cis RA promoted differentiation, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML-I preadipocytes. ATRA also modulated adipokine expression by increasing the mRNA level of adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin and LPL), and by inhibiting PAI-1 mRNA expression in mature AML-I adipocytes. The data suggest that ATRA exerts a wide range of effects--growth arrest, apoptosis, lipogenesis and modulation of adipokine gene expression--during the maturation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.((PMID:23228968))All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used successfully in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal through retinoic acid receptor (RAR)γ activation while promoting differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors through RARα activation. Its lack of success in the treatment of non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be related to ATRA's non-selectivity for the RARα and RARγ isotypes, and specific RARα activation may be more beneficial in promoting myeloid differentiation. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of ATRA and the specific RARα agonist NRX195183 was assessed in AML1-ETO (AE)-expressing murine bone marrow (BM) progenitors. ATRA potentiated the in vitro clonogenicity of these cells while NRX195183 had the opposite effect. Morphological and flow cytometric analysis confirmed a predominantly immature myeloid population in the ATRA-treated AE cells while the NRX195183-treated cells demonstrated an increase in the mature myeloid population. Similarly, NRX195183 treatment promoted myeloid differentiation in an AE9a in vivo murine model. In the ATRA-treated AE cells, gene expression analyses revealed functional networks involving SERPINE1 and bone morphogenetic protein 2; AKT phosphorylation was upregulated. Collectively, these findings confirm the contrasting roles of specific RARα and RARγ activation in the clonogenicity and differentiation of AE cells with potential significant implications in the treatment of non-APL AML using a specific RARα agonist.((PMID:23133936))((PMID:22923494))Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in regulating cell type specific gene expression during hematopoiesis but has also been suggested to be aberrantly regulated during leukemogenesis. To understand the leukemogenic chromatin signature, we analyzed acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of leukemia characterized by the expression of RARα-fusion proteins, such as PML-RARα. We used nuclease accessibility sequencing in cell lines as well as patient blasts to identify accessible DNA elements and identified > 100 000 accessible regions in each case. Using ChIP-seq, we identified H2A.Z as a histone modification generally associated with these accessible regions, whereas unsupervised clustering analysis of other chromatin features, including DNA methylation, H2A.Zac, H3ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and the regulatory factor p300, distinguished 6 distinct clusters of accessible sites, each with a characteristic functional makeup. Of these, PML-RARα binding was found specifically at accessible chromatin regions characterized by p300 binding and hypoacetylated histones. Identifying regions with a similar epigenetic make up in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, another subtype of AMLs, revealed that these regions are occupied by the oncofusion protein AML1-ETO. Together, our results suggest that oncofusion proteins localize to accessible regions and that chromatin accessibility together with p300 binding and histone acetylation characterize AML1-ETO and PML-RARα binding sites.((PMID:22714999))Leukemia, a group of hematological malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, is a disease involving dynamic change in the genome. Chromosomal translocation and point mutation are the major mechanisms in leukemia, which lead to production of oncogenes with dominant gain of function and tumor suppressor genes with recessive loss of function. Targeted therapy refers to treatment strategies perturbing the molecules critical for leukemia pathogenesis. The t(15;17) which generates PML-RARα, t(8;21) that produces AML1-ETO, and t(9;22) which generates BCR-ABL are the three most frequently seen chromosomal translocations in myeloid leukemia. The past two to three decades have witnessed tremendous success in development of targeted therapies for acute and chronic myeloid leukemia caused by the three fusion proteins. Here, we review the therapeutic efficacies and the mechanisms of action of targeted therapies for myeloid leukemia and show how this strategy significantly improve the clinical outcome of patients and even turn acute promyelocytic leukemia from highly fatal to highly curable.((PMID:21638933))To evaluate the value of multiprobe Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel in detection of the common cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloidleukemia( AML). And to investigate its association with clinical diagnosis, chemotherapy and prognosis.Using the multiprobe AML/MDS panel designed to detect upto eight different FISH probes, which was for AML1/ETO transfusion gene, PML-RARα transfusion gene, CBFβ/MYH11 transfusion gene, MLL breakapart, P53 deletion,Del(5q), Del(7q), Del(20q), 40 cases of AML were investigated. The conventional karyotype analysis and the in-formation about the treatment responses were also used for assessing.22 of the 40 AML cases were found to carry 7 types of cytogenetic abnormalities by multiprobe FISH panel including AML1/ETO transfusion gene, PML-RARa transfusion gene, MLL breakapart, P53 deletion, Del (5q), Del7q and trisomy 8. However conventional karyotype analysis only discovered 11 cases with the corresponding cytogenetic abnormalities, the positive ratio was 57.5% in multiprobe FISH panel higher than that in karyotype analysis (27.50%). Patiens with AML1/ETO or PML-RARa transfusion gene are easily to reach CR in the first induction chemotherapy, while the Del(7q), MLL breakapart, complex cytogenetic abnormalities may indicate poor prognosis.Mutiprobe FISH panel is more rapid, accurate and effective for detecting the common cytogenetic abnormalities in AML, compared with the conventional karyotype analysis and common FISH analysis.((PMID:21316759))Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the characteristics of IDH1-mutated AML are still not known clearly. We analyzed 416 Chinese AML patients and found 28 patients (6.7%) carried this mutation. One homozygous IDH1 mutant in AML was found. The IDH1 mutations were associated with NPM1 mutations (P=0.043) and could coexist with recurrent transcription factor aberrations including AML1-ETO (6/50), PML-RARα (3/77) and CBFβ-MYH11 (1/15). For AML with AML1-ETO fusion gene, IDH1(mut) patients may have worse disease-free survival (DFS) than IDH1(wild-type) patients.((PMID:21178013))Hematopoietic lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells are essential for the development of secondary lymphoid tissues including lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Two transcription factors, the helix-loop-helix inhibitor Id2 and the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (Rorγt), have been shown to be crucial for LTi cell development. However, it remains unclear how the specification of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells toward the LTi lineage is programmed. In this study, we report impaired lymphoid tissue organogenesis in mice in which the function of Runx1/Cbfβ transcription factor complexes was attenuated by the loss of either the distal promoter-derived Runx1 or Cbfβ2 variant protein. We found that LTi progenitors in fetal liver, defined previously as a lineage marker-negative α4β7 integrin (α4β7)(+) IL-7R α-chain (IL-7Rα)(+) population, can be subdivided into Rorγt-expressing IL-7Rα(high) cells and nonexpressing IL-7Rα(mid) cells. Whereas Id2 and Rorγt are required to direct α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(mid) cells to become α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(high) cells, Runx1/Cbfβ2 complexes are necessary for the emergence of α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(mid) cells. In addition, the loss of Cbfβ2, but not P1-Runx1, resulted in an inefficient upregulation of Rorγt in residual α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(+) LTi cells at anlagen. Our results thus revealed that Runx1/Cbfβ2 complexes regulate the differentiation of LTi cells at two stages: an early specification of hematopoietic progenitors toward the LTi lineage and a subsequent activation of Rorγt expression at anlagen.((PMID:21168207))CMTM5 has been shown to exhibit tumor suppressor activities, however, its role in leukemia is unclear. Herein we firstly reported the expression and function of CMTM5 in myeloid leukemia. CMTM5 was down-regulated, or undetectable, in leukemia cell lines and bone marrow cells from leukemia patients with promoter methylation. Ectopic expression of CMTM5-v1 strongly inhibited the proliferation of K562 and MEG-01 cells. In addition, significant negative correlations were observed between CMTM5 and three leukemia-specific fusion genes (AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and BCR/ABL1). CMTM5 expression was up-regulated in patients who had undergone treatment. Therefore, CMTM5 may be involved in the pathomechanism of myeloid leukemias.((PMID:21104160))Chemical biology, using small molecules as probes to study the cellular signaling network, has developed rapidly in recent years. The interaction between chemistry and biology not only provides new insight into the understanding of cellular activities, but also generates new lead compounds for the treatment of diseases. Transcription factors and kinases such as retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARα), acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1), CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), c-myc, and c-abl play important roles in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Abnormalities in these proteins may cause the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and even the occurrence of leukemia. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation represents a critical mechanism in regulating the cellular levels and functions of these proteins. Thus, targeting protein degradation has been emerging as an important strategy to conquer malignant diseases. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances in the understanding of the roles of protein degradation in leukemia, with an emphasis on the mechanisms revealed by small molecules.((PMID:20395453))Leukotriene B(4) type-1 receptor (BLT1), which plays a role in various inflammatory diseases, is exclusively expressed in peripheral leukocytes, which suggests that its expression is stringently regulated. However, the precise mechanism of BLT1 expression is not fully understood. Here we report that acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1/Runx1) is involved in the enhancement of BLT1 expression in leukocytes. In retinoic acid (RA)-stimulated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, the transcription of the BLT1 gene was found to be significantly activated. RA did not directly modulate the BLT1 promoter, suggesting enhancers in other loci. DNase I-hypersensitivity analyses revealed an activated region, termed AE-BLex, at the intron-I:exon-II boundary. AE-BLex acts as an enhancer for the BLT1 promoter and possesses 2 AML1 recognition sites. The importance of AML1 was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, reporter assays, and knockdown experiments. We demonstrated that the enhancement of BLT1 expression during the RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is due to a loosening of the chromatin structure around AE-BLex, which leads to the incremental binding of AML1. The AML1/AE-BLex complex was confirmed in other BLT1- expressing leukemia cell lines and human peripheral leukocytes. Thus, AML1 enhances BLT1 expression by binding to AE-BLex, which is accessible in leukocytes.((PMID:26148230))The ETS transcription factor ERG has been implicated as a major regulator of both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemias harboring t(16;21), ERG function is deregulated due to a fusion with FUS/TLS resulting in the expression of a FUS-ERG oncofusion protein. How this oncofusion protein deregulates the normal ERG transcription program is unclear. Here, we show that FUS-ERG acts in the context of a heptad of proteins (ERG, FLI1, GATA2, LYL1, LMO2, RUNX1 and TAL1) central to proper expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype. Moreover, in t(16;21) FUS-ERG co-occupies genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR:RARA inhibiting target gene expression and interfering with hematopoietic differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS-ERG knockdown alleviate the myeloid-differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS-ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.((PMID:24769646))All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is well established as differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which the PML-RARα (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α) fusion protein causes blockade of the retinoic acid (RA) pathway; however, in types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) other than APL, the mechanism of RA pathway inactivation is not fully understood. This study revealed the potential mechanism of high ATRA sensitivity of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9-positive AML compared with MLL-AF4/5q31-positive AML. Treatment with ATRA induced significant myeloid differentiation accompanied by upregulation of RARα, C/EBPα, C/EBPɛ and PU.1 in MLL-AF9-positive but not in MLL-AF4/5q31-positive cells. Combining ATRA with cytarabine had a synergistic antileukemic effect in MLL-AF9-positive cells in vitro. The level of dimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) in the RARα gene-promoter region, PU.1 upstream regulatory region (URE) and RUNX1+24/+25 intronic enhancer was higher in MLL-AF9-positive cells than in MLL-AF4-positive cells, and inhibiting lysine-specific demethylase 1, which acts as a histone demethylase inhibitor, reactivated ATRA sensitivity in MLL-AF4-positive cells. These findings suggest that the level of H3K4me2 in the RARα gene-promoter region, PU.1 URE and RUNX1 intronic enhancer is determined by the MLL-fusion partner. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of ATRA sensitivity in AML and novel treatment strategies for ATRA-resistant AML.((PMID:25543697))To investigate the characteristics and the short- or long-term treatment outcomes of the adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in China.From 1999 to 2010, 822 adult cases with AML were enrolled, diagnosed and classified by the FAB and WHO criteria, respectively. The treatment outcomes and prognostic factors were analyzed retrospectively.In all patients with a median age of 38.5(15-83) years, acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (M5), AML with t(15;17)/PML-RARα (APL) and AML with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO(M2b) were the most common subtypes, accounting for 29.7%, 20.9% and 14.6% respectively. In APL patients, CR was achieved in 95.2%, with an early death (ED) rate of 4.8%. And the estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 year was 87.5% and 88.8%, respectively. Patients with other AML subtype (Non-APL) revealed a CR rate of 82.0%, ED of 4.3%, and estimated 5-year OS and DFS both of 48.8%. The OS rate of Non-APL patients at 3-year varied significantly (P<0.01) among three prognostic groups by cytogenetic risk stratification:favorable, 69.5%; intermediate, 52.8%; unfavorable, 29.8%. The prognostic factors for OS among Non-APL included age, cytogenetic abnormalities, courses of the median/high-dose cytarabine and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.When compared with the previous reports, the AML patients in our study were younger and showed a different subtype distribution. Treatment outcomes of APL and Non-APL were just the same as those in international leukemia centers. Chemotherapy by risk stratification, after diagnosis and classification according to the WHO criteria, is a key point to improve the outcomes in AML.((PMID:25543469))This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between expression of CD200 antigen and clinical characteristics in AML patients and to analyse the value of CD200 in evaluation of AML prognosis. The CD200 and immunophenotypes were detected by flow cytometry, the chromosome karyotypes were determined by R banding, the FISH was used to measure the AML1/ETO, PML/RARa and inv(16), and PCR technique was used to detect the fusion genes AML1/ETO and PML/RARα. The results showed that the positive rate of CD200 antigen expression in 54 patients was 57.4% (31/54), the CD200 antigen expression between sex and age of patients was no significant different (P > 0.05). There was significant difference of CD200 expression between CD34 and CD117 (P < 0.05), but the difference of CD200 expression in chromosome karyotypes was no significant difference(P > 0.05). Moreover, there was significant difference of CD200 expression in CD34 and CD117 of CBF positive AML patients (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the CD200 antigen expression in AML may associate with a poor prognosis of patients.((PMID:20388510))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated translocations often cause gene fusions that encode oncofusion proteins. Although many of the breakpoints involved in chromosomal translocations have been cloned, in most cases the role of the chimeric proteins in tumorigenesis is not elucidated. Here we will discuss the fusion proteins of the 4 most common translocations associated with AML as well as the common molecular mechanisms that these four and other fusion proteins utilize to transform progenitor cells. Intriguingly, although the individual partners within the fusion proteins represent a wide variety of cellular functions, at the molecular level many commodities can be found.((PMID:19491417))Recurrent balanced translocations are generally recognized to be a major parameter for prognostication in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The chromosomal translocation t(15;17) results in PML/RARalpha fusion gene, t(8;21) results in AML1/ETO fusion gene and Inv 16 generates CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion gene. Patients with these mutations have a good prognosis unlike abnormalities in chromosome 5 or 7 or FLT3 genes. Therefore, we screened the AmL patients for known specific genetic abnormalities that could lead to more definitive prognoses.A total of 113 AML patients were evaluated at diagnosis based on routine morphology and cytochemistry and classified according to the WHO criteria. The distribution of AML subtypes was M1(1), M2(32), M3(57), M4(14), M5(1), M6(1) and seven cases where morphological subtype could not be classified. RT-PCR was performed to identify PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 and FLT3 nternal tandem duplication (ITD).Of the 57 patients with M3 subtype, 55 had the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript. The prevalence of bcr3 (short isoform) was higher (62%) than that of bcr1 (long isoform) (38%) and no correlation was found with age, sex or white blood cell count. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations were more frequent in patients with APL than in other AML subtypes (17.5 vs. 8.9%), the frequency greater in patients with bcr3 isoform (70%) than in those with in bcr1 isoform (30%). Patients with FLT3/ ITD mutations had a significantly higher median white cell count than those without these mutations (55 x 10(9)/l vs. 6.3 x 10(9)/l P<0.001). More patients with FLT3/ITD mutations died early (53%) than those without these mutations (16%) (P<0.01). AML1-ETO fusion transcript was detected in 16 of 56 patients with no correlation with clinical or haematological parameters.The results of the present study showed presence of bcr3 (short isoform) higher than bcr1 (long isoform). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was predominant in acute promyelocytic leukaemia patients with bcr3 isoform. Thus, patients with APL who have FLT3 mutation appear to have a poorer prognosis. Therefore, rapid identification of specific translocations at diagnosis is important for prognostic purposes and their detection should be incorporated into routine assessment.((PMID:22983443))ERG and FLI1 are closely related members of the ETS family of transcription factors and have been identified as essential factors for the function and maintenance of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Here genome-wide analysis revealed that both ERG and FLI1 occupy similar genomic regions as AML1-ETO in t(8;21) AMLs and identified ERG/FLI1 as proteins that facilitate binding of oncofusion protein complexes. In addition, we demonstrate that ERG and FLI1 bind the RUNX1 promoter and that shRNA-mediated silencing of ERG leads to reduced expression of RUNX1 and AML1-ETO, consistent with a role of ERG in transcriptional activation of these proteins. Finally, we identify H3 acetylation as the epigenetic mark preferentially associated with ETS factor binding. This intimate connection between ERG/FLI1 binding and H3 acetylation implies that one of the molecular strategies of oncofusion proteins, such as AML1-ETO and PML-RAR-α, involves the targeting of histone deacetylase activities to ERG/FLI1 bound hematopoietic regulatory sites. Together, these results highlight the dual importance of ETS factors in t(8;21) leukemogenesis, both as transcriptional regulators of the oncofusion protein itself as well as proteins that facilitate AML1-ETO binding.((PMID:18788621))To establish a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) for quantitative detection of the common molecular markers that have affirmative clinical significance in the acute and chronic leukemia patients, and evaluate its significance in diagnosing leukemias and monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD).Primers and TaqMan probes were designed for detecting various fusion transcripts and normal abl gene was used as the internal control. The expression level of fusion transcripts in 202 newly diagnosed leukemias were determined.In absolute quantity, expression level of the fusion transcripts in various leukemias was b3a2 (b2a2) 47614.63, e1a2 98847.53, AML1-ETO 300029.51, PML-RAR alpha 25506.28, respectively, while in relative quantity to abl, the levels were 1.05, 0.91, 5.33 and 0.55, respectively.The relative quantification of gene expression level by using RQ-RT-PCR to abl control gene is more accurate and direct viewing. Different levels of transcription of corresponding fusion genes are found in various subtypes of leukemias at diagnosis, among which the level of AML1-ETO was higher and PML-RAR alpha lower.((PMID:18072623))To evaluate levels of common specific fusion transcripts M-bcr-abl, m-bcr-abl, TEL-AML1, AML1-ETO, PML-RAR alpha, CBF beta-MYH11 in untreated leukemia patients.Specific fusion transcript levels were detected by TaqMan-based real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique in a total of 208 samples, including 195 bone marrow samples from 50 M-bcr-abl(+) chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP), 10 M-bcr-abl(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 19 m-bcr-abl(+) ALL, 11 TEL-AML1(+) ALL, 30 AML1-ETO(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 58 PML-RAR alpha(+) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 17 CBF beta-MYH11(+) AML patients and 13 peripheral blood samples from 13 M-bcr-abl(+) CML-CP patients. abl was chosen as internal control gene. Fusion transcript level was calculated as fusion transcript copies/abl transcript copies in percentage.Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of CML-CP patients had similar M-bcr-abl fusion transcript levels (median 30% vs 35%, P > 0.05). M- and m-bcr-abl (median 64% vs 54%) levels were similar in ALL patients (P > 0.05), M-bcr-abl level was significantly higher in ALL than CML-CP patients(P < 0.001). Median TEL-AML1 level was 228% in ALL patients. Among AML patients, AML1-ETO level was significantly higher than CBF beta-MYH11 and PML-RAR alpha levels (median 388% vs 145%, 388% vs 47%, all P < 0.001), CBF beta-MYH11 level was significantly higher than PML-RAR alpha level (P < 0.001). Fusion transcript levels of L-, V- and S-type PML-RAR alpha were 45%, 44% and 55%, respectively. L-type was significantly lower than S-type (P = 0.04).Fusion transcript levels in untreated leukemia patients were different and patient-to-patient variations did exist. Detection of fusion transcript levels in untreated leukemia patients not only provides baseline for minimal residual disease monitoring and treatment evaluation but also enable the comparison in inter-laboratory data.((PMID:16832676))The acute promyelocytic leukemia-specific PML-RARalpha fusion protein is a dominant-negative transcriptional repressor of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target genes, which recruits HDAC and corepressor proteins and inhibits coactivators. Another oncogenic transcription factor, AML1-ETO, was proposed to cause an HDAC-dependent repression of RAR target genes. The RAR target RARbeta2 gene has been reported to be frequently silenced by hypermethylation in many types of cancer cells. We examined the methylation status of the RARbeta2 and asked if demethylation could reverse ATRA resistance in ATRA-resistant PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO-positive cells. PML-RARalpha positive NB4 and its ATRA-resistant subvariant MR2 and AML1-ETO expressing Kasumi-1 cells had heterozygous methylation of RARbeta2. Although DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially reversed RARbeta2 CpG methylation in these cells, it did not significantly enhance ATRA-induced RARbeta2 mRNA expression and induction of maturation. However, the histone acetylase inhibitor SAHA combined with ATRA significantly reactivated RARbeta2 mRNA both in NB4 and MR2 cells with degradation of PML-RARalpha, which was associated with maturation. In contrast, SAHA did not affect AML1-ETO levels and failed to induce RARbeta2 expression and maturation in Kasumi-1 cells. In primary AML samples, RARbeta2 expression was uniformly low; however, no specific correlation was observed between the methylation of the RARbeta2 gene and expression of the fusion proteins, PML-RARalpha, and AML1-ETO. These results demonstrate that oncogenic PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO translocations are rarely associated with RARbeta2 promoter methylation in primary AML samples.((PMID:15968309))To assess the value of common fusion genes analysis in the diagnosis and classification of leukemia by multiplex RT-PCR.The multiplex RT-PCR, including 8 parallel PCR reactions, could screen 86 mRNA breakpoints or splice variants at the same time, which was important for the diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia. Bone marrow samples from 161 cases of leukemia and 8 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were involved in the study. The distribution of common fusion genes in leukemia was analyzed by the method mentioned above in combination with clinical and morphological features.Ten fusion genes were detected in 115 cases of leukemia, including AML1/ETO, PML/RAR alpha, PLZF/RAR alpha, dupMLL, MLL/AF6, MLL/AF10, CBFbeta/MYH11, BCR/ABL, Hox11, and EVI1 BCR/ABL was positive in all the 52 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia; PML/RAR alpha was found in 21 of 25 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and PLZF/RAR alpha was detected in one case of APL. Sixteen cases of 17 AML1/ETO-positive acute leukemia (AL) belonged to FAB-M2 subtype, and one case was mixed leukemia. Three of 4 AL cases carrying CBFbeta/MYH11 were M4 subtype, and one was M5 subtype. MLL aberrations were found in 16 AL, in which all MLL/AF6 translocation existed in M5 subtype with classic monoblastic characters. Furthermore, BCR/ABL was detected in 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. Fusion genes were also found in 2 MDS cases, of which AML1/ETO positive-MDS-RAEB progressed to AML rapidly.Screening of common fusion genes by multiplex RT-PCR is an important tool which could provide useful and reliable molecular genetic information for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.((PMID:15667548))((PMID:15168592))Many studies have assessed the clinical significance of the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia. Thus far, many studies have suggested that MRD detection to evaluate the response to chemotherapy is useful for predicting the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, few studies have reported on the significance of MRD in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because of small numbers of patients and limited availability of MRD markers. Therefore, we monitored MRD using currently available markers at several points during the treatment for childhood AML and tried to intensify the treatment based on the results of MRD. Thirty-one patients (26 de novo cases and 5 other cases) were examined for MRD between February 1999 and May 2002. After the first consolidation therapy (consolidation 1), the expression of Wilms tumor gene (WT1) and/or leukemia-specific fusion genes such as AML1/MTG8, PML/RAR alpha, and MYH11/CBF beta were analyzed. Patients with positive MRD but in hematological remission at that point were recommended to undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT). Positive WT1 expression (more than 10(3) copies/microgram RNA) was detected in 18 of 31 patients (58.1%) at onset. After consolidation 1 therapy, the WT1 expression became negative in 14 of 18 patients. The AML1/MTG8 fusion gene was expressed in 8 patients, PML/RAR alpha was expressed in 3 patients, and MYH11/CBF beta was expressed in 1 patient. Four of the 8 patients with AML1/MTG8 expression and all 3 with PML/RAR alpha expression also demonstrated positive WT1 expression at onset. Eight (5 de novo cases and 3 other cases) of the 31 patients had no available MRD markers. Four patients who showed pesistently high expression of WT1 after consolidation 1 therapy underwent SCT, and only 1 patient remained in complete remission (CR). Among 14 patients who became negative for WT1 expression, 6 patients received SCT for various reasons. Among 8 patients with the AML1/MTG8 fusion gene, 2 became MRD negative and 6 continued to be positive. Four of these 6 patients underwent SCT, and all but one who underwent syngeneic SCT became MRD negative. On the other hand, 1 of the 2 patients who continued on chemotherapy continued to be MRD positive, suggesting a graft-versus-leukemia effect in allogeneic SCT. All patients with the PML/RAR alpha and MYH11/CBF beta fusion gene continued to be in CR. The 3-year event-free survival in de novo AML was 69.4% +/- 9.8% (n = 26), a result that is encouraging and superior to other reported outcomes. Thus, an MRD-based treatment strategy together with conventional risk factors appears to be required for further improving the outcomes of AML.((PMID:14660751))Acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs) are genetically heterogeneous and characterized by chromosomal rearrangements that produce fusion proteins with aberrant transcriptional regulatory activities. Expression of AML fusion proteins in transgenic mice increases the risk of myeloid leukemias, suggesting that they induce a preleukemic state. The underlying molecular and biological mechanisms are, however, unknown. To address this issue, we performed a systematic analysis of fusion protein transcriptional targets. We expressed AML1/ETO, PML/RAR, and PLZF/RAR in U937 hemopoietic precursor cells and measured global gene expression using oligonucleotide chips. We identified 1,555 genes regulated concordantly by at least two fusion proteins that were further validated in patient samples and finally classified according to available functional information. Strikingly, we found that AML fusion proteins induce genes involved in the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype and repress DNA repair genes, mainly of the base excision repair pathway. Functional studies confirmed that ectopic expression of fusion proteins constitutively activates pathways leading to increased stem cell renewal (e.g., the Jagged1/Notch pathway) and provokes accumulation of DNA damage. We propose that expansion of the stem cell compartment and induction of a mutator phenotype are relevant features underlying the leukemic potential of AML-associated fusion proteins.((PMID:12460926))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated chromosomal translocations result in formation of chimeric transcription factors, such as PML/RARalpha, PLZF/RARalpha, and AML-1/ETO, of which the components are involved in regulation of transcription by chromatin modeling through histone acetylation/deacetylation. The leukemic differentiation block is attributed to deregulated transcription caused by these chimeric fusion proteins, which aberrantly recruit histone-deacetylase (HDAC) activity. One essential differentiation pathway blocked by the leukemic fusion proteins is the vitamin (Vit) D(3) signaling. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which the leukemic fusion proteins interfere with VitD(3)-induced differentiation. The VitD(3)-receptor (VDR) is, like the retinoid receptors RAR, retinoid X receptor, and the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, the transcriptional activity of TR and RAR is silenced by recruitment of HDAC activity through binding to corepressors. In the presence of ligand, TR and RAR activate transcription by releasing HDAC activity and by recruiting histone-acetyltransferase activity. Here we report that VDR binds corepressors in a ligand-dependent manner and that inhibition of HDAC activity increases VitD(3) sensitivity of HL-60 cells. Nevertheless, the inhibition of HDAC activity is unable to overcome the block of VitD(3)-induced differentiation caused by PLZF/RARalpha expression. Here we demonstrate that the expression of the translocation products PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha impairs the localization of VDR in the nucleus by binding to VDR. Furthermore, the overexpression of VDR in U937 cells expressing AML-related translocation products completely abolishes the block of VitD(3)-induced differentiation. Taken together these data indicate that the AML-associated translocation products block differentiation not only by interfering with chromatin-modeling but also by sequestering factors involved in the differentiation signaling pathways, such as VDR in the VitD(3)-induced differentiation.((PMID:12145988))Mutations in signal transduction molecules, which regulate cell differentiation and proliferation, are involved in the development of leukemia. Aberrations of receptor type tyrosine kinases are known to arise from FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, and c-Kit mutations in mast cell tumors. BCR/ABL found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hallmark of the constitutively active forms of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Downstream of the tyrosine kinase is the RAS GTP-binding protein, and genetic mutations related to this protein have been found in a wide variety of malignant tumors including hematopoietic tumors. In the nucleus, transcription factor-encoding genes are frequently detected as the targets of chromosomal translocations found in specific types of leukemias. For instance, the AML1 gene generates AML1/MTG8 chimera by t (8;21) translocation in AML (M2), AML1/EVI-1 chimera by t (3;21) translocation in blastic crisis of CML, and TEL/AML1 chimera in t (12;21) translocation (pre-B cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Another example of abnormal transcription factors is PML/RAR alpha generated by t (15;17) translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Mutations or deletions of tumor suppressor genes are frequently found in cell cycle regulators such as p53, RB and p16 genes. Therefore, mutations of any molecules involved in the signal transduction pathways from growth factor receptors to inside the nucleus are thought to contribute to neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells.((PMID:11930660))To present a special case with the karyotype and molecular marker of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M2 who was induced to complete remission by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone.A recently hospitalized young female patient with acute leukemia was initially diagnosed as M3 subtype based on morphological French-American-British (FAB) classification. Karyotype analysis using standard G and R banding techniques and RT-PCR were applied to further define the diagnosis. After primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the iliac aspiration were tested for in vitro induced differentiation, the patient was treated with oral all-trans retinoic acid alone, 60 mg per day until complete remission was achieved. Peripheral blood and bone marrow changes were monitored over the whole treatment course.The characteristic chromosomal aberration for M3, the t(15;17) reciprocal translocation, was not found while a t(8;21) translocation was verified. Furthermore, an amplified product of the AML-1/ETO fusion gene instead of the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene was detected by RT-PCR and the diagnosis was corrected from M3 to M2. Primary cultured bone marrow cells can be fully induced to terminal differentiation after 4 days exposure to ATRA. A hematological complete remission was achieved after 40 days treatment with ATRA as a single therapeutic agent, suggesting an alternative pathway mediating ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation.A leukemia patient with a subtype other than M3, such as M2 in this case, may also be induced to complete remission by the mechanism of ATRA-induced terminal differentiation. This implies that there may be a pathway other than PML/RAR alpha fusion gene product which mediates ATRA-induced myeloid maturation in leukemia cells.((PMID:11090081))The AML-1/ETO fusion protein, created by the (8;21) translocation in M2-type acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), is a dominant repressive form of AML-1. This effect is due to the ability of the ETO portion of the protein to recruit co-repressors to promoters of AML-1 target genes. The t(11;17)(q21;q23)-associated acute promyelocytic leukemia creates the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger PLZFt/RAR alpha fusion protein and, in a similar manner, inhibits RAR alpha target gene expression and myeloid differentiation. PLZF is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and functions as a growth suppressor by repressing cyclin A2 and other targets. ETO is a corepressor for PLZF and potentiates transcriptional repression by linking PLZF to a histone deacetylase-containing complex. In transiently transfected cells and in a cell line derived from a patient with t(8;21) leukemia, PLZF and AML-1/ETO formed a tight complex. In transient assays, AML-1/ETO blocked transcriptional repression by PLZF, even at substoichiometric levels relative to PLZF. This effect was dependent on the presence of the ETO zinc finger domain, which recruits corepressors, and could not be rescued by overexpression of co-repressors that normally enhance PLZF repression. AML-1/ETO also excluded PLZF from the nuclear matrix and reduced its ability to bind to its cognate DNA-binding site. Finally, ETO interacted with PLZF/RAR alpha and enhanced its ability to repress through the RARE. These data show a link in the transcriptional pathways of M2 and M3 leukemia. (Blood. 2000;96:3939-3947)((PMID:10882117))RAR and AML1 transcription factors are found in leukemias as fusion proteins with PML and ETO, respectively. Association of PML-RAR and AML1-ETO with the nuclear corepressor (N-CoR)/histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex is required to block hematopoietic differentiation. We show that PML-RAR and AML1-ETO exist in vivo within high molecular weight (HMW) nuclear complexes, reflecting their oligomeric state. Oligomerization requires PML or ETO coiled-coil regions and is responsible for abnormal recruitment of N-CoR, transcriptional repression, and impaired differentiation of primary hematopoietic precursors. Fusion of RAR to a heterologous oligomerization domain recapitulated the properties of PML-RAR, indicating that oligomerization per se is sufficient to achieve transforming potential. These results show that oligomerization of a transcription factor, imposing an altered interaction with transcriptional coregulators, represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic activation.((PMID:10450762))((PMID:10422290))The Wilms tumor gene (WT1) has been reported to be a prognostic factor and a marker for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia. Using competitive polymerase chain reaction procedures, we examined the expression of the WT1 gene in acute leukemia patients with several tumor-specific DNA markers, including bcr/abl, PML/RAR alpha, and AML1/MTG8. A strong correlation was observed between the levels of WT1 and PML/RAR alpha expression. However, AML1/MTG8 transcripts were detected at all stages of the disease even when the expression level of WT1 gene was low. From these findings, we concluded that monitoring the WT1 expression level is a useful means of determining the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and that WT1 is an effective marker for the detection of MRD, especially in acute myeloid leukemia patients with AML1/MTG8.((PMID:9643569))Here we studied minimal residual disease (MRD) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO as well as the phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets involved in antitumor immunity. Eight patients in long-term (LT; 3 to 15 years) and 15 patients in short-term (ST; up to 3 years) remission were studied. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT) assay, the limit of detection was 10(-5) to 10(-6) for PML/RAR alpha transcript and 10(-4) to 10(-5) for the AML1/ETO transcript. Simultaneously, T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis. Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive. Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free, 3 of the 7 MRD-positive (MRD+) patients in ST remission soon relapsed. The total populations of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ [possible T-cell and natural killer (T/NK) populations] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly (p < .01) low. The CD8+ CD28+ population showed the same tendency (p < .01-.02). The T/NK subsets in the BM of MRD-negative (MRD-) LT (MRD-/LT) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers. Basically, the total percentage of the CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order: MRD-/LT patients, normal volunteers, MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients. The percentages of the T/NK-cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups. Thus, the difference of the possible T/NK-cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission. These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti-tumor immunity of T/NK cells of AML in remission.((PMID:22613483))In this study, we cloned grass carp foxp3 (gcfoxp3) gene including 5' flanking region and determined its expression profiles in vivo under immunosuppressive conditions. Sequence analysis revealed that the promoter of gcfoxp3 contains AP-1, AML-1/Runx1, NF-κb and GATA-3 binding sites, which positively or negatively regulate mammalian foxp3 expression. In addition, the intron II of gcfoxp3 contains some putative binding sites including AP-1, NFAT, Smad3, RAR, CREB/ATF and FOXO1, which are corresponding to their locations in the proximal intronic enhancers of human foxp3. In an in vivo model of grass carp, an immunosuppressive agent rapamycin was showed to stimulate gcfoxp3 mRNA expression in thymus, gill, head kidney and spleen after bacterial challenge. Moreover, rapamycin increased gcFoxp3 protein levels with an additive manner in the infected fish. These findings support the involvement of fish Foxp3 in immune response and highlight a possible signaling pathway that regulates teleost Foxp3 expression.((PMID:18439490))The retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta2, and gamma regulate specific subsets of target genes during all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells. The Tie1 gene exhibited reduced expression in RA-treated F9 RARgamma-/- cells as compared to wild-type (WT) by microarray analysis. Our goal was to analyze the Tie1 gene, which encodes a surface receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in the hematovascular system.We assessed Tie1, Tie2, Flk1, Runx1, Peg/Mest2, and angiopoietin-1 and 2 mRNA levels and Tie1 promoter activity.We showed that RARgamma, but not RARalpha or RARbeta2, is required for Tie1 promoter activation by RA. Treatment with a RARgamma selective agonist plus a retinoid X receptor agonist (LGD1069) increased Tie1 mRNA levels by 11- +/- 2.5-fold 48 hours after RA addition in F9 WT, but not in F9 RARgamma-/- cells, by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Multiple putative GATA elements were identified in the Tie1 proximal promoter. RA increased GATA4 transcripts by 12- +/- 1-fold in F9 WT at 48 hours, but not in F9 RARgamma-/- cells. In addition, transfection of a GATA4 expression vector increased Tie1 promoter/luciferase activity in both RA-treated F9 WT and RARgamma-/- cells. Tie1 promoter deletion analyses indicated that a region of the promoter that possessed multiple GATA sites mediated the RA-associated Tie1 transcriptional increase.Our results indicate that GATA4 plays a role in the RA/RARgamma-associated transcriptional activation of the Tie1 promoter. An understanding of RAR specificity in RA signaling should result in insights into hematopoietic stem cell signaling and potentially in improved therapies for several human diseases.((PMID:18164278))The biological effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), a major active metabolite of retinol, are mainly mediated through its interactions with retinoic acid receptor (RARs alpha, beta, gamma) and retinoid X receptor (RXRs alpha, beta, gamma) heterodimers. RAR/RXR heterodimers activate transcription by binding to RA-response elements (RAREs or RXREs) in the promoters of primary target genes. Murine F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells have been widely used as a model for cellular differentiation and RA signaling during embryonic development. We identified and characterized genes that are differentially expressed in F9 wild type (Wt) and F9 RARgamma-/- cells, with and without RA treatment, through the use of oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Our data indicate that RARgamma, in the absence of exogenous RA, modulates gene expression. Genes such as Sfrp2, Tie1, Fbp2, Emp1, and Emp3 exhibited higher transcript levels in RA-treated Wt, RARalpha-/- and RARbeta2-/- lines than in RA-treated RARgamma-/- cells, and represent specific RARgamma targets. Other genes, such as Runx1, were expressed at lower levels in both F9 RARbeta2-/- and RARgamma-/- cell lines than in F9 Wt and RARalpha-/-. Genes specifically induced by RA at 6h with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in F9 Wt, but not in RARgamma-/- cells, included Hoxa3, Hoxa5, Gas1, Cyp26a1, Sfrp2, Fbp2, and Emp1. These genes represent specific primary RARgamma targets in F9 cells. Several genes in the Wnt signaling pathway were regulated by RARgamma. Delineation of the receptor-specific actions of RA with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation should result in more effective therapies with this drug.((PMID:20010624))Terminal differentiation of blood cells requires the concerted action of a series of transcription factors that are expressed at specific stages of maturation and function in a cell-type and dosage-dependent manner. Leukemogenic oncoproteins block differentiation by subverting the normal transcriptional status of hematopoietic precursor cells. Pirin (PIR) is a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression is silenced in cells bearing the acute myeloid leukemia-1 eight-twenty-one (AML1/ETO) and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR) leukemogenic fusion proteins. A role for PIR in myeloid differentiation has not to date been reported. In this study we show that PIR expression is significantly repressed in a large proportion of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), regardless of subtype or underlying karyotypic abnormalities. We show that PIR expression increases during in vitro myeloid differentiation of primary hematopoietic precursor cells, and that ablation of PIR in the U937 myelomonocytic cell line or in murine primary hematopoietic precursor cells results in impairment of terminal myeloid differentiation. Gene expression profiling of U937 cells after knockdown of PIR revealed increased expression of genes associated with the early phases of hematopoiesis, in particular, homeobox A (HOXA) genes. Our results suggest that PIR is required for terminal myeloid maturation, and its downregulation may contribute to the differentiation arrest associated with AML.((PMID:19317219))A number of molecular targets have been identified in leukemia, based on the understanding of signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and malignant transformation. Growth factors and integrins interact with their receptors and activate signaling cascades with intimate interconnections. The specific niches within the bone marrow microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of leukemic cells to escape chemotherapy-induced death and acquire drug resistance. Investigations into bone marrow stroma-leukemia crosstalk may result in the development of strategies against the acquisition of a chemo-resistant phenotype and enhance the efficacy of therapies in leukemia. In recent studies, we proposed novel therapeutic interventions targeting the microenvironment/leukemia interaction focusing on SDF1/CXCR4, ILK/PI3K/Akt, TGF-beta, and Notch signaling. Gene transcriptional activity is regulated by chromatin modification and DNA methylation. Nuclear receptors such as RAR, RXR, and PPARgamma exert histone acetyl transferase activity (HAT). The transcription of target genes is initiated following the ligation of these receptors, recruitment of co-activators, and replacement of repressors. We demonstrated that histone acetylation by the PPARgamma agonist CDDO, RAR/RXR agonist ATRA, and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) reversed the silenced RARbeta and MDR1 genes in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that HDACI induced apoptosis with phagocytosis through the induction of Annexin A1 in AML1/ETO-positive acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells. The translation of research findings into effective clinical laboratory tests is an important approach. The flow cytometric technique is a powerful tool in the field of clinical laboratory medicine, with its accurate and rapid analysis. We carried out phospho-specific flow cytometry to investigate protein phosphorylation in AML cells and detect ZAP-70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, including the evaluation of antibodies, staining epitopes, fixing and permeabilizing methods, and analyzing systems. Finally, we emphasize the potential applications of research findings and methods in the fields of clinical medicine, molecular diagnosis, and targeting therapy.((PMID:19035174))To investigate the expression level of preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) mRNA in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and evaluate its usefulness for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD).PRAME mRNA levels were detected in bone marrow samples from 142 newly diagnosed AML patients (72 of them didn't express any specific fusion gene) by TaqMan based real-time quantitative PCR methods, and were serially monitored in 60 bone marrow samples from 9 follow-up patients (2 of them without specific fusion gene), including 3 in continuous complete remission, 6 in hematological relapse. Bone marrow samples from 22 bone marrow donors (NBM) were served as normal controls. Samples from 7 AML1-ETO (+) M2 patients were detected for AML1-ETO mRNA simultaneously. abl was selected as control gene, PRAME and AML1-ETO mRNA levels were expressed by their copies/abl copies in percentage.All NBM samples expressed PRAME mRNA and the upper limit was 0.28%. For all newly diagnosed AML patients, median PRAME mRNA level was 3.97% (0.00%-714.97%), 76.8% of them was higher than 0.28%, 54.9% had over 1-log increasing and 26.1% had over 2-log increasing. For patients without specific fusion gene, median PRAME mRNA level was 0.60% (0.00%-408.72%), 56.3% of them was over 0.28%, 32.4% and 11.3% had over 1-log and 2-log increasing, respectively. There was a significant difference in PRAME mRNA levels between subtypes of AML patients (P<0.01). AML1-ETO (+) M2 patients expressed the highest levels (all P<0.01), followed by acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with S type PML-RAR alpha fusion gene. PRAME and AML1-ETO mRNA levels of follow up patients displayed similar kinetic patterns, and correlated well in 43 follow up samples (r=0.88, P<0.01). PRAME mRNA levels in 3 hematological relapsed patients increased above 0.28% 1-4 months ahead relapse, and in other 3 relapsed patients the levels never decreased to normal range even in remission.PRAME mRNA could be used to monitor MRD for AML patients with higher than normal levels, and it increases over or persistently higher than normal range predicts hematological relapse.((PMID:18445043))Basophilic crisis and eosinophilia are well recognized features of advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia. In other myeloid neoplasms, however, transformation with marked basophilia and eosinophilia is considered unusual.We examined the long-term follow-up of 322 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to define the frequency of basophilic, eosinophilic and mixed lineage (basophilic and eosinophilic) transformation.Of all patients, only one developed mixed lineage crisis (>or= 20% basophils and >or= 20% eosinophils). In this patient, who initially suffered from chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, basophils increased to 48% and eosinophils up to 31% at the time of progression. Mixed lineage crisis was not accompanied by an increase in blast cells or organomegaly. The presence of BCR/ABL and other relevant fusion gene products (FIP1L1/PDGFRA, AML1/ETO, PML/RAR alpha, CBF beta/MYH11) were excluded by PCR. Myelomastocytic transformation/myelomastocytic leukaemia and primary mast cell disease were excluded by histology, KIT mutation analysis, electron microscopy and immunophenotyping. Basophils were thus found to be CD123+, CD203c+, BB1+, KIT- cells, and to express a functional IgE-receptor. Among the other patients with MDS examined, 4(1.2%) were found to have marked basophilia (>or= 20%) and 7(2.1%) were found to have massive eosinophilia ( >or= 20%), whereas mixed-lineage crisis was detected in none of them.Mixed basophil/eosinophil crisis may develop in patients with MDS but is an extremely rare event.((PMID:15908787))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription and specific functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer. Inhibitors of HDACs (HDACI) possess anti-tumor activity and are well tolerated, suggesting that they might develop into a specific strategy for cancer treatment. Indeed, HDACIs have successfully entered clinical trials, but the molecular basis for their selective anti-tumor activities is not clear. Recent work on leukemias expressing the PML-RAR or AML1-ETO oncogenes, known to initiate leukemogenesis through deregulation of HDACs, shows that HDACIs induce massive blast-cell apoptosis. Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic activity of the drug is not due to the relief of oncogene-mediated inhibition of the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway but, instead, relies on the selective upregulation of the death receptors DR5 and Fas and their cognate ligands TRAIL and FasL. Significantly, normal myeloid progenitors are not sensitive to HDACI-induced apoptosis and oncogene expression is not sufficient to confer HDACI-sensitivity to normal cells, demonstrating that sensitivity to HDACI is a property of the fully transformed phenotype. In principle, our findings could thus apply to other cancers, where the contribution of HDACs to tumorigenesis is not yet defined.((PMID:15748426))In the last twenty years, using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as a differentiation inducer, Shanghai Institute of Hematology has achieved an important breakthrough in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which realized the theory of reversing phenotype of cells and provided a successful model of differentiation therapy in cancers. Our group first discovered in the world the variant chromosome translocation t(11;17)(q23;q21) of APL, and cloned the PML-RAR alpha, PLZF-RAR alpha and NPM-RAR alpha fusion genes corresponding to the characterized chromosome translocations t(15;17); t(11;17) and t(5;17) in APL. Moreover, establishment of transgenic mice model of APL proved their effects on leukemogenesis. The ability of ATRA to modify the recruitment of nuclear receptor co-repressor with PML-RAR alpha but not PLZF-RAR alpha caused by the variant chromosome translocation elucidated the therapeutic mechanism of ATRA from the molecular level and provides new insight into transcription-modulating therapy. Since 1994, our group has successfully applied arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) in treating relapsed APL patients, with the complete remission rate of 70% - 80%. The molecular mechanism study revealed that As(2)O(3) exerts a dose-dependent dual effect on APL. Low-dose As(2)O(3) induced partial differentiation of APL cells, while the higher dose induced apoptosis. As(2)O(3) binds ubiquitin like SUMO-1 through the lysine 160 of PML, resulting in the degradation of PML-RAR alpha. Taken together, ATRA and As(2)O(3) target the transcription factor PML-RAR alpha, the former by retinoic acid receptor and the latter by PML sumolization, both induce PML-RAR alpha degradation and APL cells differentiation and apoptosis. Because of the different acting pathways, ATRA and As(2)O(3) have no cross-resistance and can be used as combination therapy. Clinical trial in newly diagnosed APL patients showed that ATRA/As(2)O(3) in combination yields a longer disease-free survival time. With the median survival of 18 months, none of the 20 cases in combination treatment relapsed, whereas 7 relapsed in 37 cases in mono-treatment. This is the best clinical effect achieved in treating adult acute leukemia to this day, possibly making APL the first adult curable leukemia. Based on the great success of the pathogenetic gene target therapy in APL, this strategy may extend to other leukemias. Combination of Gleevec and arsenic agents in treating chronic myeloid leukemia has already make a figure both in clinical and laboratory research, aiming at counteracting the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and the degradating BCR-ABL fusion protein. In acute myeloid leukemia M(2b), using new target therapy degradating AML1-ETO fusion protein and reducing the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit will also lead to new therapeutic management in acute leukemias.((PMID:15619634))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription and specific cellular functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer. Inhibitors of HDACs (HDACIs) possess antitumor activity and are well tolerated, supporting the idea that their use might develop as a specific strategy for cancer treatment. The molecular basis for their selective antitumor activity is, however, unknown. We investigated the effects of HDACIs on leukemias expressing the PML-RAR or AML1-ETO oncoproteins, known to initiate leukemogenesis through deregulation of HDACs. Here we report that: (i) HDACIs induce apoptosis of leukemic blasts, although oncogene expression is not sufficient to confer HDACI sensitivity to normal cells; (ii) apoptosis is p53 independent and depends, both in vitro and in vivo, upon activation of the death receptor pathway (TRAIL and Fas signaling pathways); (iii) TRAIL, DR5, FasL and Fas are upregulated by HDACIs in the leukemic cells, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. These results show that sensitivity to HDACIs in leukemias is a property of the fully transformed phenotype and depends on activation of a specific death pathway.((PMID:12872151))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is becoming popular in the diagnosis of clonal chromosomal abnormalities. We set up a fast FISH procedure using an extensive set of specific probes. Conventional banding analysis (CBA) and FISH were compared in 260 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. For FISH the following probes were used: MLL, CBF-beta/MYH11, ETV-6/AML1; AML1/ETO, BCR/ABL, PML/RAR, c-MYC, TP53, RB1, 5q31/5p15.2, 5q33-34, 7q31/CEP7, 20q13; CEP 4, X, Y. Result time was 96 h for CBA versus 5 h for FISH from direct harvest. CBA showed clonal abnormalities in 41% (n=105/260), normal karyotype in 39% (n=102/260) and failed in 20% (n=53/260). FISH screened all patients and detected abnormalities in 39% (n=102/260); CBA and FISH together identified abnormalities in 49% (n=128/260). In six patients with normal CBA and in eight patients with clonal karyotype, it detected further cryptic abnormalities. CBA showed clonal abnormalities in 13% of patients negative at FISH (n=21/158). FISH screening does not add relevant information to CBA, but is the quickest method for detecting major genetic abnormalities in AML. The speed of FISH is very valuable in AML-M3/M3v because PML/RAR+ patients require specific therapy. Furthermore, we suggest FISH screening in failed, complex or suboptimal quality chromosome and specific FISH analysis for 5q, 7q, 12p, 17p, inv(16), t(11q23) in order to implement CBA accuracy.((PMID:15809276))The leukaemias, which are divided into chronic and acute forms, are malignant diseases of haematopoietic cells in which the proper balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis is no longer operative. Genes, such as those of mixed-lineage leukaemia, AML1 and retinoic acid receptor alpha, have been found to be aberrantly fused to different partners, which often encode transcription factors or other chromatin modifying enzymes, in numerous types of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias. These chimeric fusion oncoproteins, generated by reciprocal chromosomal translocations, are responsible for chromatin alterations on target genes whose expression is critical to stem cell development or lineage specification in haematopoiesis. Alterations in the 'histone code' or in the DNA methylation content occur as consequence of aberrant targeting of the corresponding enzymatic activities. Here, the author will review the most recent progress in the field, focusing on how fusion proteins generated by chromosomal translocation are responsible for chromatin alterations, gene deregulation and haematopoietic differentiation block and their implication for clinical treatment.((PMID:15024077))The acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated translocation products AML1-ETO, PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), and PLZF-RARalpha encode aberrant transcription factors. Several lines of evidence suggest similar pathogenetic mechanisms for these fusion proteins. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify shared target genes in inducibly transfected U937 cells expressing AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, or PLZF-RARalpha. All three fusion proteins significantly repressed the expression of 38 genes and induced the expression of 14 genes. Several of the regulated genes were associated with Wnt signaling. One of these, plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), was induced on the mRNA and protein level by all three fusion proteins. In addition, primary AML blasts carrying one of the fusion proteins significantly overexpressed plakoglobin. The plakoglobin promoter was cloned and shown to be induced by AML1-ETO, with promoter activation depending on the corepressor and histone deacetylase binding domains. The induction of plakoglobin by AML fusion proteins led to downstream signaling and transactivation of TCF- and LEF-dependent promoters, including the c-myc promoter, which was found to be bound by plakoglobin in vivo after AML1-ETO expression. beta-Catenin protein levels and TCF and LEF target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 were found to be induced by the fusion proteins. On the functional level, a dominant negative TCF inhibited colony growth of AML1-ETO-positive Kasumi cells, whereas plakoglobin transfection into myeloid 32D cells enhanced proliferation and clonal growth. Injection of plakoglobin-expressing 32D cells into syngeneic mice accelerated the development of leukemia. Transduction of plakoglobin into primitive murine hematopoietic progenitor cells preserved the immature phenotype during colony growth, suggesting enhanced self-renewal. These data provide evidence that activation of Wnt signaling is a common feature of several balanced translocations in AML.((PMID:10221524))We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia FAB-type 2 with a translocation t(15;17)(q22;q12) On the basis of the cytological findings, a translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) was suspected. FISH analyses using specific probes for t(15;17) and t(8;21) detected both PML/RARalpha and AML1/ETO rearrangements in a few percentage of cells. This case demonstrates the complexities that may occur between cytology and cytogenetic findings and the usefulness of FISH methods to detect an AML1/ETO rearrangement only suspected by cytological examination of bone marrow smears.((PMID:20804918))Oncogene amplification resulting in aberrant expression, although common in solid tumors, is rare in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is mostly associated with amplification of MYC, RUNX1, and MLL genes. Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and other target sequences at 17p11.2 often represent the amplicons expressed in breast cancer, not in AML. We present a unique case of a 59-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, now presenting with pancytopenia and bilateral infiltration with effusion in nodules of the right upper lobe of the lung. She was diagnosed with AML-M5. Chromosome analysis demonstrated a hypodiploid clone with complex numerical/structural abnormalities including 5q deletion, monosomy 7, as well as structurally rearranged chromosome 11 and several marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed amplification of RARA, loss of 7q, monosomy 7, loss of DEK (6p23), and additional copies of NUP214 (9q34) and MLL (11q23). Additional FISH studies showed both ERBB2 and TOP2A genes, which were co-amplified on one of the marker chromosomes. The follow-up bone marrow did not yield any metaphases, but FISH was normal for all probes, including RARA. After a short remission, the patient relapsed and showed clonal evolution. Additional case reports are necessary to assess whether RARA amplification in hematologic malignancies serves as an independent prognostic factor.((PMID:18264136))The use of genetically engineered mice (GEM) have been critical in understanding disease states such as cancer, and none more so than acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), a disease characterized by over 100 distinct chromosomal translocations. A substantial proportion of cases exhibiting recurrent reciprocal translocations at diagnosis, such as t(8;21) or t(15;17) have been exhaustively studied and are currently employed in clinical diagnosis. However, a definitive conclusion regarding the leukaemogenic potential of defined transgenes for this disease remains elusive. While it is increasingly apparent that a number of cooperating mutations are necessary to develop a leukaemic phenotype, the number of models reflecting these synergisms remains few. Furthermore, little emphasis has been paid to the effect of chromosomal translocations other than recurrent genetic abnormalities, with no models reflecting the multiple abnormalities observed in high-risk cases of AML accounting for 8-10% of adult AML. Here we review the differing technologies employed in generation of GEM of AML. We discuss the relevance of GEM AML from embryonic stem cell-mediated (for example retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusions and AML1/ETO) models; through to the valuable retroviral-mediated gene transfer models. The latter have been used to great effect in defining the transforming properties of chromosomal translocation products such as MLL (found in 5-6% of all AML cases) and NUP98 (denoting poor prognosis in therapy-related disease) and particularly when co-transduced with bad prognostic factors such as Flt3 mutations. Finally, we comment on the emergence of newer transduction technologies, which can regulate the level of expression to defined cell lineages in both primary murine and human xenografts, and discuss how combining multiple genetic modalities, more relevant models of this complex disease are being generated.((PMID:17361223))PU.1, a transcription factor of the ETS family, plays a pivotal role in normal hematopoiesis, and particularly in myeloid differentiation. Altered PU.1 function is possibly implicated in leukemogenesis, as PU.1 gene mutations were identified in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and as several oncogenic products (AML1-ETO, promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha, FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication) are associated with PU.1 downregulation. To demonstrate directly a role of PU.1 in the blocked differentiation of leukemic blasts, we transduced cells from myeloid cell lines and primary blasts from AML patients with a lentivector encoding PU.1. In NB4 cells we obtained increases in PU.1 mRNA and protein, comparable to increases obtained with all-trans retinoic acid-stimulation. Transduced cells showed increased myelomonocytic surface antigen expression, decreased proliferation rates and increased apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in primary AML blasts from 12 patients. These phenotypic changes are characteristic of restored blast differentiation. PU.1 should therefore constitute an interesting target for therapeutic intervention in AML.((PMID:16581786))MEF is an ETS-related transcription factor with strong transcriptional activating activity that affects hematopoietic stem cell behavior and is required for normal NK cell and NK T-cell development. The MEF (also known as ELF4) gene is repressed by several leukemia-associated fusion transcription factor proteins (PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha and AML1-ETO), but it is also activated by retroviral insertion in several cancer models. We have previously shown that cyclin A-dependent phosphorylation of MEF largely restricts its activity to the G(1) phase of the cell cycle; we now show that MEF is a short-lived protein whose expression level also peaks during late G(1) phase. Mutagenesis studies show that the rapid turnover of MEF in S phase is dependent on the specific phosphorylation of threonine 643 and serine 648 at the C terminus of MEF by cdk2 and on the Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(Skp2), which targets MEF for ubiquitination and proteolysis. Overexpression of MEF drives cells through the G(1)/S transition, thereby promoting cell proliferation. The tight regulation of MEF levels during the cell cycle contributes to its effects on regulating cell cycle entry and cell proliferation.((PMID:14523474))Cellular and systemic O(2) concentrations are tightly regulated to maintain delicate oxygen homeostasis. Although the roles of hypoxia in solid tumors have been widely studied, few studies were reported regarding the possible effects of hypoxia on leukemic cells. Here, we showed for the first time that low concentrations of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), a hypoxia-mimicking agent, and 2-3% O(2) triggered differentiation of various subtypes of human acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines, including NB4, U937 and Kasumi-1 cells, respectively, from M3, M5 and M2b-type AML, but CoCl(2) did not modulate AML subtype-specific fusion proteins promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) and AML1-ETO. Treatment with CoCl(2) also induced primary leukemic cells from some AML patients to undergo differentiation. Similar to what occurs in solid tumor cells, CoCl(2)-mimicked hypoxia also increased the level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein and its DNA-binding activity in leukemic cells. The CoCl(2) induction of HIF-1alpha protein and its DNA-binding activity were inhibited by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, which also blocked CoCl(2)-induced cell differentiation in leukemic cells. These results provide an insight into a possible link of hypoxia or HIF-1alpha and leukemic cell differentiation, and are possibly of significance to explore clinical potentials of hypoxia or hypoxia-mimicking agents and novel target-based drugs for differentiation therapy of leukemia.((PMID:10419474))AML2 is a member of the acute myelogenous leukemia, AML family of transcription factors. The biologic functions of AML1 and AML3 have been well characterized; however, the functional role of AML2 remains unknown. In this study, we found that AML2 protein expressed predominantly in cells of hematopoietic origin is a nuclear serine phosphoprotein associated with the nuclear matrix, and its expression is not cell cycle-related. In HL-60 cells AML2 expression can be induced by all three natural retinoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 13-cis-RA, and 9-cis-RA in a dose-dependent manner. A synthetic retinoic acid derivative, 4HPR, which neither activates RA receptor (RAR) alpha nor retinoic X receptor alpha was unable to induce the expression of AML2. A RAR-selective activator, TTNPB, induced AML2 expression similar to RA. Our study further showed that AGN193109, a potent RARalpha antagonist, suppressed AML2 expression induced by RA and that a retinoic X receptor pan agonist AGN194204 had no effect on its expression. Taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrated that the expression of AML2 in HL-60 cells is regulated through the RARalpha-specific signaling pathway. Our study further showed that after all-trans-retinoic acid priming, AML2 expression could be augmented by vitamin D(3). Based on these studies we hypothesize that AML2 expression is normally regulated by retinoid/vitamin D nuclear receptors mainly through the RARalpha-dependent signaling pathway and that it may play a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation.((PMID:7949179))The WT1 gene encoding a zinc finger polypeptide is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a key role in the carcinogenesis of Wilms' tumor. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine relative levels of WT1 gene expression (defined in K562 cells as 1.00) in 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 22 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 with acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL), 23 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 24 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Significant levels of WT1 gene were expressed in all leukemia patients and for CML the levels increased as the clinical phase progressed. In striking contrast with acute leukemia, the levels of WT1 gene expression for NHL were significantly lower or even undetectable. Clear correlation was observed between the relative levels of WT1 gene expression (< 0.6 v > or = 0.6) and the prognosis for acute leukemia (AML, ALL, and AMLL). Patients with less than 0.6 levels had significantly higher rates of complete remission (CR), disease-free survival, and overall survival than those with > or = 0.6 levels, whereas CR could not be induced in any of the 7 patients with acute leukemia having greater than 1.0 levels of WT1 gene expression. The quantitation of the WT1 gene expression made it possible to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia regardless of the presence or absence of tumor-specific DNA markers. Continuous monitoring of the WT1 mRNA was performed for 9 patients with acute leukemia. In 4 patients, MRD was detected 2 to 8 months before clinical relapse became apparent. In 2 other patients, the WT1 mRNA gradually increased after discontinuation of chemotherapy. No MRD was detected in the remaining 3 patients with AML who received intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Simultaneous monitoring of MRD by RT-PCR using primers for specific DNA markers in 3 patients (2 AML-M3 with PML/RAR alpha, and 1 AML-M2 with AML1/ETO) among these 9 patients detected MRD comparable with that obtained from quantitation of WT1 gene expression. In a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, the limits of leukemic cell detection by RT-PCR using either WT1 or promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene primers were 10(-3) to 10(-4) and 10(-4) for bone marrow, and 10(-5) and 10(-4) for peripheral blood, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that WT1 is a new prognostic factor and a new marker for the detection of MRD in acute leukemia.((PMID:25996952))The adapter protein metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) is implicated as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter, depending on the type of solid cancer. Here, we identified Mtss1 expression to be increased in AML subsets with favorable outcome, while suppressed in high risk AML patients. High expression of MTSS1 predicted better clinical outcome of patients with normal-karyotype AML. Mechanistically, MTSS1 expression was negatively regulated by FLT3-ITD signaling but enhanced by the AML1-ETO fusion protein. DNMT3B, a negative regulator of MTSS1, showed strong binding to the MTSS1 promoter in PML-RARA positive but not AML1-ETO positive cells, suggesting that AML1-ETO leads to derepression of MTSS1. Pharmacological treatment of AML cell lines carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation with the specific FLT3 inhibitor PKC-412 caused upregulation of MTSS1. Moreover, treatment of acute promyelocytic cells (APL) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) increased MTSS1 mRNA levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that MTSS1 might have a context-dependent function and could act as a tumor suppressor, which is pharmacologically targetable in AML patients.((PMID:20861459))Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a highly curable disease with excellent complete remission and long-term survival rates. However, the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) is being reported with increasing frequency in patients successfully treated for APL. We attempted to clarify the different clinical features and hematologic findings between t-MN and relapse cases, and to identify gene alterations involved in t-MN. We compared 10 relapse and 11 t-MN cases that developed in 108 patients during their first complete remission from APL. At APL diagnosis, t-MN patients had lower white blood cell counts than did relapse patients (P = .048). Overall survival starting from chemotherapy was significantly worse in t-MN patients than in relapse patients (P = .022). The t-MN cases were characterized as CD34(+)/HLA-DR(+) and PML-RARA(-), and 4 RUNX1/AML1 mutations were detected. T-MN is easily distinguished from APL relapse by evaluating these hematologic features, and it may originate from primitive myeloid cells by chemotherapy-induced RUNX1 mutations.((PMID:19860185))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of tumor cells that arise from the hematopoietic stem/progenitor population within the bone marrow. Cytogenetic abnormalities or point mutations of the hematopoiesis-specific genes are frequently found in patients with AML, and these genetic aberrations are closely associated with the pathophysiology of the disease. Molecular pathogenesis of AML has been disclosed through analyses of such gene aberrations, including AML1 and MLL abnormalities, PML-RARA chimeric gene, activating mutations of FLT3, and EVI-1 abnormalities. Through prediction of prognosis and targeted therapy, this knowledge on pathogenesis of AML has been applied to the clinical practice, and further investigation should improve the outcome of therapy for AML in the future.((PMID:19027486))Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that is characterized by peculiar clinical and biologic features, including severe hemorrhagic diathesis, specific recurrent chromosomal aberration, and distinct morphologic features with predominant pathologic promyelocytes. A reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17)(q22;q21), is a characteristic feature of APL that represents approximately 5-8% of AML. The rearranged gene created by this translocation encodes a chimeric protein PML-RARA that is a transcriptional repressor. In contrast to other AML subtypes, APL is particularly sensitive to treatment with all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with chemotherapy, converting this once fatal leukemia to a highly curable disease. Nonetheless, therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myelogenous leukemia (t-MDS/AML) has been reported as a rare complication of chemotherapy in APL. Of 30 APL cases described as t-MDS/AML in the literature, only 1 case relapsed as acute leukemia with t(3;21)(q26;q22). Here we describe a rare case of APL relapsing as secondary AML with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and clinically characterize this patient using the RUNX1 (previously AML1)-MDS1-EVI1 fusion transcript (with follow-up for 55 months), and review the relevant literature.((PMID:17556074))Submicroscopic deletions of genes in recurrent chromosomal rearrangements occur frequently in hematologic malignancies, but their incidences have not been reported clearly. We investigated the incidence of submicroscopic deletions and their association with specific genetic rearrangements in various hematologic malignancies. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study was conducted in 336 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 223 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and 79 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The incidence of submicroscopic deletions in patients with chromosomal rearrangements was the highest in the TEL/AML1 rearrangement (65.0%), followed by BCR/ABL (10.9%), MLL (5.6%), AML/ETO (4.0%), and PML/RARA (0.0%). Submicroscopic deletion was quite common, and incidences were variable according to disease entities and chromosomal translocations. To detect submicroscopic deletions, careful FISH study should be included for the cytogenetic study of hematologic malignancies, and their association with clinical prognosis needs to be further studied.((PMID:17251199))We report the first dry-reagent, disposable, dipstick test for molecular screening of seven chromosomal translocations associated with acute and chronic leukemia. The dipstick assay offers about 10 times higher detectability than agarose gel electrophoresis and, contrary to electrophoresis, allows confirmation of the sequence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product by hybridization within a few minutes without the need of instrumentation. Biotinylated amplified DNA is hybridized with a dA-tailed probe and applied to the strip, which contains oligo(dT)-conjugated gold nanoparticles in dry form. Upon immersion of the strip in the appropriate buffer, the solution migrates and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone generating a characteristic red line. The excess nanoparticles are captured by oligo(dA) strands immobilized at the control zone of the strip producing a second red line. We studied the: t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(5;17)(q32;q21), t(11;17)(q13;q21), t(8,21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13;q22) that generate the BCR-ABL, PML-RARa, PLZF-RARa, NPM-RARa, NuMA-RARa, AML1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion genes, respectively. A single K562 cell was detectable amidst 10(6) normal leukocytes. A dipstick test was developed for actin, as a reference gene. The dipstick assay with appropriate probes can be used for identification of the fusion transcripts involved in the translocation.((PMID:16140925))AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME) is a chimeric transcription factor produced by the (3;21)(q26;q22) translocation. This chromosomal translocation is associated with de novo and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and with the blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. AME is obtained by in-frame fusion of the AML1 and MDS1/EVI1 (ME) genes. The mechanisms by which AME induces a neoplastic transformation in bone marrow cells are unknown. AME interacts with the corepressors CtBP and HDAC1, and it was shown that AME is a repressor in contrast to the parent transcription factors AML1 and ME, which are transcription activators. Studies with murine bone marrow progenitors indicated that the introduction of a point mutation that destroys the CtBP-binding consensus impairs but does not abolish the disruption of cell differentiation and replication associated with AME expression, suggesting that additional events are required. Several chimeric proteins, such as AML1/ETO, BCR/ABL, and PML/RARa, are characterized by the presence of a self-interaction domain critical for transformation. We report that AME is also able to oligomerize and displays a complex pattern of self-interaction that involves at least three oligomerization regions, one of which is the distal zinc finger domain. Although the deletion of this short domain does not preclude the self-interaction of AME, it significantly reduces the differentiation defects caused in vitro by AME in primary murine bone marrow progenitors. The addition of a point mutation that inhibits CtBP binding completely abrogates the effects of AME on differentiation, suggesting that AME induces hematopoietic differentiation defects through at least two separate but cooperating pathways.((PMID:15193435))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can detect minor genetic changes that cytogenetic analysis may miss; however, there are few reports on the kinds of genetic changes that show large discrepancies between results obtained with FISH versus G-banding techniques. To investigate genetic changes that tend to be detected with FISH only, we compared the results of cytogenetic study and FISH analysis in 919 consecutive specimens from 304 patients with hematologic malignancies, covering most of the frequent genetic changes by using 18 types of FISH probes. The genetic changes with especially large discrepancy rates at diagnosis were del(7q) (20.0%), PML/RARA (17.6%), and trisomy 21 (12.5%) and, at follow-up, BCR/ABL (28.2%) and AML1/ETO (24.4%); the latter two showed only small discrepancies at diagnosis (4.7 and 4.8%, respectively). The overall discrepancy rate was 6.0% at diagnosis and 11.9% at follow-up, indicating generally greater discrepancy rates at follow-up. In all but one of the cases with discrepant results, G-banding missed the corresponding chromosomal abnormalities revealed with FISH. Considered by type of leukemia, the discrepancy rate at follow-up was higher in acute biphenoptypic leukemia (38%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24.5%) than in acute myelogenous leukemia (10.6%). Given these results, all patients with known genetic changes should have FISH analysis in follow-up, for an accurate assessment of the likelihood of complete remission or recurrence. If this is not practical, then at a minimum FISH analysis should be done in follow-up for patients with genetic changes of BCR/ABL and AML1/ETO seen at diagnosis.((PMID:12842988))To evaluate the prognostic significance of quantitative PML-RARA, AML1-ETO, and CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcript expression, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze bone marrow samples of 349 such patients at diagnosis and 522 samples of 142 patients also during therapy (total analyses, n = 859; median number of follow-up samples, 4/patient; median duration of assessment, 12 months). Lower expression levels at diagnosis correlated with better overall and event-free survival in all 3 leukemia subtypes. By combining the median expression ratio after consolidation therapy and the 75th percentile of the expression ratio at diagnosis, a new score was established that separates a group with 100% EFS from a significantly worse group (P <.0001) in each of the 3 acute myeloid leukemia subgroups. Eight patients showed increasing levels of expression during follow-up and all had relapse. In conclusion, patients at high risk for treatment failure can be identified by high levels of fusion gene expression at diagnosis or less than 3 logs of tumor reduction during the first 3 to 4 months of therapy. By combining the transcription ratios at these 2 checkpoints, a new powerful prognostic score has been established.((PMID:12699896))Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was carried out in five patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia of various French-American-British subtypes and with double trisomy of chromosomes 8 and 21. PML-RARA fusion was detected with appropriate molecular probes in one patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia without t(15;17). Two PAC probes covering the 5' and 3' part of the RUNX1 gene were used in the four other patients. While three copies were present in three patients, as expected from conventional karyotype analysis, only two hybridization signals were present in the fifth patient. This was due to the apparent loss of the 3' part of RUNX1. Since chromosome number abnormalities may be associated with submicroscopic gene rearrangements, it should be important to search for them for a better understanding of mechanisms of leukemogenesis, and to understand the prognostic heterogeneity in leukemic patients with aneusomies without apparent chromosome structure rearrangements.((PMID:11753612))T(8;21) AML1(CBFA2)-ETO(MTG8) is the most common chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in both children and adults. We sought to understand the structure and gain insight into the fusion process between AML1 and ETO by sequencing genomic fusions in 17 primary childhood AMLs and two cell lines with t(8;21). Reciprocal translocations were sequenced for seven of the 19 samples. We assumed a null hypothesis that the translocation breakpoints would be evenly distributed along the intronic breakpoint cluster regions. Testing for multimodality via smoothed bootstrap statistical methods suggested, however, the presence of two separate cluster regions within both the AML1 and ETO breakpoint cluster regions. ETObreakpoints were predominantly located in intron 1B in a defined cluster 5' of exon 1A (scan statistic P value = 0.00001). All patients with available RNA expressed an AML1-ETO mRNA fusion between exon 5 of AML1 and exon 2 of ETO. Since the structural restraints for the fusion protein of AML1-ETO exclude exon 1A, we reason that ETO intron 1B harbors a structural feature with propensity for breakage and/or recombination. Chromosomal breakpoints displayed evidence of fusion by a non-homologous end joining process, with microhomologies and nontemplate nucleotides at some fusion junctions. Breakpoints in general displayed similar complexity of duplications, deletions, and insertions to other common pediatric leukemia translocations (TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, PML-RARA, CBFB-MYH11) that we and others have analyzed.((PMID:26871368))The new World Health Organization's (WHO) classification of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms incorporating the recurrent fusion genes as the defining criteria for different haematopoietic malignant phenotypes is reviewed. The recurrent fusion genes incorporated in the new WHO's classification and other chromosomal rearrangements of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms are reviewed.Cytokines and transcription factors in haematopoiesis and leukaemic mechanisms are described. Genetic features and clinical implications due to the encoded chimeric neoproteins causing malignant haematopoietic disorders are reviewed.Multiple translocation partner genes are well known for leukaemia such as MYC, MLL, RARA, ALK, and RUNX1. With the advent of more sophisticated diagnostic tools and bioinformatics algorithms, an exponential growth in fusion genes discoveries is likely to increase.Demonstration of fusion genes and their specific translocation breakpoints in malignant haematological disorders are crucial for understanding the molecular pathogenesis and clinical phenotype of cancer, determining prognostic indexes and therapeutic responses, and monitoring residual disease and relapse status.((PMID:26345235))In the present study, we analyzed microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression profiles using 499 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples and 58 normal thyroid tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A pivotal regulatory network of 18 miRNA and 16 targets was identified. Upregulated miRNAs (miR-222, miR-221, miR-146b, miR-181a/b/d, miR-34a, and miR-424) and downregulated miRNAs (miR-9-1, miR-138, miR-363, miR-20b, miR-195, and miR-152) were identified. Among them, the upregulation of miR-424 and downregulation of miR-363, miR-195, and miR-152 were not previously identified. The genes CCNE2 (also known as cyclin E2), E2F1, RARA, CCND1 (cyclin D1), RUNX1, ITGA2, MET, CDKN1A (p21), and COL4A1 were overexpressed, and AXIN2, TRAF6, BCL2, RARB, HSP90B1, FGF7, and PDGFRA were downregulated. Among them, CCNE2, COL4A1, TRAF6, and HSP90B1 were newly identified. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, several miRNAs (miR-222, miR-221, and miR-34a) and genes (CCND1 and MET) were ideal diagnostic indicators, with sensitivities and specificities greater than 90%. The combination of inversely expressed miRNAs and targets improved diagnostic accuracy. In a clinical feature analysis, several miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-424, miR-20b, and miR-152) and genes (CCNE2, COL4A1, TRAF6, and HSP90B1) were associated with aggressive clinical features, which have not previously been reported. Our study not only identified a pivotal miRNA regulatory network associated with PTC but also provided evidence that miRNAs and target genes can be used as biomarkers in PTC diagnosis and clinical risk evaluation.((PMID:26126967))Transcriptional dysregulation is associated with haematological malignancy. Although mutations of the key haematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 are rare in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), they are common in murine models of radiation-induced AML, and PU.1 downregulation and/or dysfunction has been described in human AML patients carrying the fusion oncogenes RUNX1-ETO and PML-RARA. To study the transcriptional programmes associated with compromised PU.1 activity, we adapted a Pu.1-mutated murine AML cell line with an inducible wild-type PU.1. PU.1 induction caused transition from leukaemia phenotype to monocytic differentiation. Global binding maps for PU.1, CEBPA and the histone mark H3K27Ac with and without PU.1 induction showed that mutant PU.1 retains DNA-binding ability, but the induction of wild-type protein dramatically increases both the number and the height of PU.1-binding peaks. Correlating chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Seq with gene expression data, we found that PU.1 recruitment coupled with increased histone acetylation induces gene expression and activates a monocyte/macrophage transcriptional programme. PU.1 induction also caused the reorganisation of a subgroup of CEBPA binding peaks. Finally, we show that the PU.1 target gene set defined in our model allows the stratification of primary human AML samples, shedding light on both known and novel AML subtypes that may be driven by PU.1 dysfunction.((PMID:24464319))The lack of molecular diagnosis in the field of cancer in Iraq has motivated us to perform a genetic analysis of pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), including class I and II aberrations. Peripheral blood or bone marrow cells were collected from 134 AML children aged ≤15 years. Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper cards were used to transfer dried blood samples from five Iraqi hospitals to Japan. DNA sequencing was performed to identify class I mutations. Nested RT-PCR was used to detect class II aberrations, except that MLL rearrangement was detected according to long distance inverse-PCR. NPM1 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations were analyzed by GeneScan using DNA template. Among 134 Iraqi pediatric AML samples, the most prevalent FAB subtype was M2 (33.6 %) followed by M3 (17.9 %). Class I mutations: 20 (14.9 %), 8 (6.0 %), and 8 (6.0 %) patients had FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and KIT mutations, respectively. Class II mutations: 24 (17.9 %), 19 (14.2 %), and 9 (6.7 %) children had PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11 transcripts, respectively. MLL rearrangements were detected in 25 (18.7 %) patients. NPM1 mutation was detected in seven (5.2 %) cases. Collectively, approximately 30 % of AML children were proved to carry favorable prognostic genetic abnormalities, whereas approximately 10 % had high FLT3-ITD allelic burden and needed a special treatment plan including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was frequent among Iraqi pediatric AML. It is likely that molecular diagnosis using FTA cards in underdeveloped countries could guide doctors towards an appropriate treatment strategy.((PMID:23806810))The recent World Health Organization classification recognizes different subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the presence of several recurrent genetic abnormalities. Detection of these abnormalities and other molecular changes is of increasing interest because it contributes to a refined diagnosis and prognostic assessment in AML and enables monitoring of minimal residual disease. These genetic abnormalities can be detected using single RT-PCR, although the screening is still labor intensive and costly. We have developed a novel real-time RT-PCR assay to simultaneously detect 15 AML-associated rearrangements that is a simple and easily applicable method for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories. This method showed 100% specificity and sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 91% to 100% and 92% to 100%, respectively). The procedure was validated in a series of 105 patients with AML. The method confirmed all translocations detected using standard cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization and some additional undetected rearrangements. Two patients demonstrated two molecular rearrangements simultaneously, with BCR-ABL1 implicated in both, in addition to RUNX1-MECOM in one patient and PML-RARA in another. In conclusion, this novel real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of multiple AML-associated fusion genes is a versatile and sensitive method for reliable screening of recurrent rearrangements in AML.((PMID:23358744))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The genetic diagnostics have become an essential component in the initial work-up for disease classification, prognostication and prediction. More and more promising molecular targeted therapeutics are becoming available. A prerequisite for individualized treatment strategies is a fast pretherapeutic molecular screening including the fusion genes PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11 as well as mutations in the genes NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA. Promising new therapeutic approaches include the combination of all- trans retinoic acid and arsentrioxid in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the combination of intensive chemotherapy with KIT inhibitors in core-binding factor AML and FLT3 inhibitors in AML with FLT3 mutation, as well as gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy in patients with low and intermediate cytogenetic risk profiles. With the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies it is expected that new therapeutic targets will be identified. These insights will lead to a further individualization of AML therapy.((PMID:23130347))Prognosis is known to be better in cases with isolated chromosomal abnormalities than in those with complex karyotypes. Accordingly, del(20q) as an isolated abnormality must be distinguished from cases in which it is associated with other chromosomal rearrangements for a better stratification of prognosis. We report a case of an isolated del(20q) abnormality with additional genomic aberrations identified using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping. A 39-yr-old man was diagnosed with AML without maturation. Metaphase cytogenetic analysis (MC) revealed del(20)(q11.2) as the isolated abnormality in 100% of metaphase cells analyzed, and FISH analysis using D20S108 confirmed the 20q deletion in 99% of interphase cells. Using FISH, other rearrangements such as BCR/ABL1, RUNX1/RUNX1T1, PML/RARA, CBFB/MYH11, and MLL were found to be negative. SNP-A identified an additional copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in the 11q13.1-q25 region. Furthermore, SNP-A allowed for a more precise definition of the breakpoints of the 20q deletion (20q11.22-q13.31). Unexpectedly, the terminal regions showed gain on chromosome 20q. The patient did not achieve complete remission; 8 months later, he died from complications of leukemic cell infiltrations into the central nervous system. This study suggests that a presumably isolated chromosomal abnormality by MC may have additional genomic aberrations, including CN-LOH, which could be associated with a poor prognosis. SNP-A-based karyotyping may be helpful for distinguishing true isolated cases from cases in combination with additional genomic aberrations not detected by MC.((PMID:23091311))Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) has recently emerged as an alternative to cytogenetics. We designed and used simplified mRT-PCR system as a molecular screen for acute leukemia. Fifteen fusion transcripts were included: BCR-ABL1, PML-RARA, ZBTB16-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, DEK-NUP214, TCF3-PBX1, ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-AFF1, MLL-MLLT4, MLL-MLLT3, MLL-MLLT10, MLL-ELL, MLL-MLLT1, and MLL-MLLT6. A total of 121 diagnostic acute leukemia specimens were studied, comparing the mRT-PCR system with standard cytogenetics. Fifty-six cases (46.3%) had fusion transcripts revealed by our mRT-PCR assay. The concordance rate between mRT-PCR and cytogenetics was 91.7%. However, false negative results were found in three cases who have inv(16), t(4;11) or t(11;19)(q23;p13.1), respectively. Seven cryptic translocations including ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-MLLT3, MLL-MLLT4, and PML-RARA were detected. This mRT-PCR assay is a useful screening tool in acute leukemia because it provides rapid and reliable detection of clinically important chimeric transcripts. In addition, cryptic translocations provide additional genetic information that could be clinically useful.((PMID:22915647))The karyotype is so far the most important prognostic parameter in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Molecular mutations have been analyzed to subdivide AML with normal karyotype into prognostic subsets. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for the entire AML cohort solely based on molecular markers. One thousand patients with cytogenetic data were investigated for the following molecular alterations: PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, FLT3-ITD, and MLL-PTD, as well as mutations in NPM1, CEPBA, RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53. Clinical data were available in 841 patients. Based on Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, 5 distinct prognostic subgroups were identified: (1) very favorable: PML-RARA rearrangement (n = 29) or CEPBA double mutations (n = 42; overall survival [OS] at 3 years: 82.9%); (2) favorable: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n = 35), CBFB-MYH11 (n = 31), or NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD (n = 186; OS at 3 years: 62.6%); (3) intermediate: none of the mutations leading to assignment into groups 1, 2, 4, or 5 (n = 235; OS at 3 years: 44.2%); (4) unfavorable: MLL-PTD and/or RUNX1 mutation and/or ASXL1 mutation (n = 203; OS at 3 years: 21.9%); and (5) very unfavorable: TP53 mutation (n = 80; OS at 3 years: 0%; P < .001). This comprehensive molecular characterization provides a more powerful model for prognostication than cytogenetics.((PMID:22450142))Most leukemia and lymphoma cases are characterized by specific flow cytometric, cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations, which can also be detected in healthy individuals in some cases. The authors review the literature concerning monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and the occurrence of chromosomal translocations t(14;18) and t(11;14), NPM-ALK fusion gene, JAK2 V617F mutation, BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, ETV6-RUNX1(TEL-AML1), MLL-AF4 and PML-RARA fusion gene in healthy individuals. At present, we do not know the importance of these aberrations. From the authors review it is evident that this phenomenon has both theoretical and practical (diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic) significance.((PMID:25750172))The transcription factor PU.1, encoded by the murine Sfpi1 gene (SPI1 in humans), is a member of the Ets transcription factor family and plays a vital role in commitment and maturation of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Murine studies directly link primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and decreased PU.1 expression in specifically modified strains. Similarly, a radiation-induced chromosome 2 deletion and subsequent Sfpi1 point mutation in the remaining allele lead to murine radiation-induced AML. Consistent with murine data, heterozygous deletion of the SPI1 locus and mutation of the -14kb SPI1 upstream regulatory element were described previously in human primary AML, although they are rare events. Other mechanisms linked to PU.1 downregulation in human AML include TP53 deletion, FLT3-ITD mutation and the recurrent AML1-ETO [t(8;21)] and PML-RARA [t(15;17)] translocations. This review provides an up-to-date overview on our current understanding of the involvement of PU.1 in the initiation and development of radiation-induced AML, together with recommendations for future murine and human studies.((PMID:25338564))This study was aimed to detect the expression of Musashi-2 (Msi2) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and investigate the relationship between Msi2 and other clinical parameters, especially CD34. A total RNA was extracted from bone marrow of newly diagnosed AML patietns. The Msi2 mRNA expression in newly diagnosed AML patients was detected with real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. The expression level of CD34 in above-menthioned patients was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The relationship between the expression of Msi2 mRNA and clinical outcome in AML patients was analysed. The results showed that (1)the expression of Msi2 mRNA in newly diagnosed AML patients was much higher than that in healthy volunteers (P < 0.05) , especially in M1, M4 and M5 patients; (2)the expression level of Msi2 did not correlate with age, sex, white blood cell count of peripheral blood, AML1/ETO and PML/RARa fusion gene (P > 0.05); (3) Msi2 expression level in patients with CD34(+) cells was significantly higher than that in patients with CD34(-) cells (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the Msi2 mRNA expresses in leukamia stem cells, the high expression of Msi2 mRNA has been found in newly diagnosed AML patients, especially in M1, M4 and M5 patients, the high expression also has been observed in patients with CD34(+).((PMID:24598642))The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with NPM1 mutation in exon 12 and to explore the relationship between NPM1 mutation and FLT3-ITD, IDH1 mutation. The AML clinical data and bone marrow samples of patients were collected. The diagnosis and classification were based on WHO criteria. The genomic DNA was extracted and NPM1 mutation was detected by sequencing after PCR. The specimens of 389 AML patients were tested. The results showed that the NPM1 mutation was found in 14.1% samples (55/389). The incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation was 14.7% (57/389) . The incidence of IDH1 mutation was 6.4% (25/389) . NPM1 mutation was not detected in AML with AML1-ETO, PML-RARA or CBF-MYH11 fusion genes. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were 29.1% and 12.7% respectively in AML with NPM1 mutation. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were 12.3% and 5.4% respectively in AML without NPM1 mutation. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were significantly higher in AML with NPM1 mutation than that in AML without NPM1 mutation. The incidence of NPM1 mutation in normal karyotype AML was 26.5% (35/132) which significantly higher than that in other AML. The AML with NPM1 mutation characterized by older age, high platelet number, higher incidence in AML-M5, lower CD34 positive cells, more possible co-existence with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation and other clinical features. The complete remission rate after one cycle of induction chemotherapy was 69.8% in AML without NPM1 mutation. The complete remission rate after one cycle of induction chemotherapy was 72.2% in AML with NPM1 mutation, there was no significant difference between them (P = 0.07). It is concluded that AML with NPM1 mutation has distinct clinical features. NPM1 mutation can co-exists with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation, but not with AML1-ETO, PML-RARA or CBF-MYH11 fusion genes.((PMID:23737874))The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of the four subtypes of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs) in order to improve current knowledge and to aid their diagnosis. A total of 53 cases of MDS/MPNs were analyzed using routine blood cell analysis and morphological, cytogenetic and molecular genetic characteristics were investigated. Numerical data for several groups were compared using a single-factor analysis of variance. The Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to compare the means of two groups. The proportions were compared using a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Analysis of the patients with MDS/MPNs revealed that 46 patients (86.8%) had paleness and fatigue, and blood analysis revealed hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 83.1±24.6 g/l, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.8±8.1×10(9)/l and a platelet (PLT) count of 158.7±108.2×10(12)/l. Immature neutrophils and monocytes were identified in the peripheral blood at levels of 0.058±0.031 and 0.152±0.034%, respectively. There were 23 cases (43.4%) with dyserythropoiesis and 36 cases (67.9%) had dysgranulopoiesis. Fifteen cases were immunologically characterized using flow cytometry (FCM), of which 13 cases showed abnormalities on blasts and myelocytes. Karyotyping was performed in 27 cases of MDS/MPN and 12 (44.4%) were identified as abnormal. In 23 cases, testing for BCR/ABL1, AML-ETO, CBF-MYH11A, PML-RARA, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, SIL-TAL1 returned negative results. The JAK2V617F mutation was positive in one of five cases. The majority of MDS/MPN cases had anemia, cytosis, low-grade blasts and immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood and dysplasia in the bone marrow. Immunological abnormalities and abnormal karyotypes occurred frequently in MDS/MPNs and although there were no statistical differences between the four subtypes, these were able to aid diagnosis. No specific molecular abnormalities were identified in MDS/MPNs.((PMID:22811791))The incidence of common fusion transcripts in AML is 40-45%, but data from Indian sub-continent is limited. AIMS #ENTITYSTARTX00026;The aim of the present study is to note the incidence of common fusion transcripts of AML1-ETO, PML-RARA and CBFβ-MYH11 in adult and pediatric AML cases. MATERIALS #ENTITYSTARTX00026;A total of 116 AML cases diagnosed on bone marrow, cytochemistry and Flow-cytometry over a period of 2 year were enrolled and bone marrow samples in EDTA were processed by multiplex RT-PCR assay.Of 116 cases, 96 (83%) were adult and 20 (17%) pediatric cases. A total of 39/116 (33.6%) cases showed positivity for fusion transcripts of which 28/96 (29.16%) were adult and 11/20 (55%) pediatric cases. Of the 28 positive adult cases, 14/96 (14.58%) were positive for AML1-ETO, 12/96 (12.5%) for PML-RARA and 2/96 (2.08%) for CBFβ-MYH11. In the 11 positive pediatric cases, 6/20 (30%) were positive for AML1-ETO, 3/20 (15%) for PML-RARA and 2/20 (10%) for CBFβ-MYH11. DISCUSSION #ENTITYSTARTX00026;The incidence of the common fusion transcripts in our pilot study is in accordance with that described in western studies. It is important to identify these transcripts as they provide useful prognostic information to the treating clinician.((PMID:22397365))Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) metabolic genes encode cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. Acquired somatic mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been reported in some types of brain tumors and a small proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases.Two-hundred and thirty newly diagnosed AML patients were analyzed for the presence of IDH1 and IDH2 heterozygous mutations by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) followed by direct sequencing. Clinical and biological characteristics were analyzed and correlated to the IDH mutational status. Coexisting mutations such as FLT3, PML-RARA, RAS, AML1, and NPM1 mutations were additionally explored.The prevalence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations was 8.7% (20/230) and 10.4% (24/230), respectively. Six missense mutations were identified among IDH1-mutated cases; p.R132H (n = 8), p.R132C (n = 6), p.R132S (n = 2), p.R132G (n = 2), p.R132L (n = 1), and p.I99M (n = 1). Two missense mutations were found in IDH2-mutated cases; p.R140Q (n = 20) and p.R172K (n = 4). No patients had dual IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. About 18% of AML with normal cytogenetics and 31% of acute promyelocytic leukemia had IDH mutations. Half of the IDH-mutated cohort had normal karyotype and the major FAB subtype was AML-M2. Interestingly, IDH1- and IDH2-mutated cases predominantly had NPM1 mutations (60-74%) as compared to the wild type (P < 0.001). Very few IDH-mutated cases had FLT3 and/or RAS abnormalities and none of them had AML1 mutations. Older age and higher median platelet counts were significantly associated with IDH2 mutations although the clinical impact of either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations on patients' overall survival could not be observed.Overall, 19% of newly diagnosed AML patients had alterations of IDH genes. No patients concurrently carried both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations suggesting that these mutations were mutually exclusive. NPM1 mutation appears as a major coexisting genetic mutation in IDH-mutated patients. Our present data failed to support the prognostic relevance of IDH mutations although alterations of these metabolic genes potentially have an important role in leukemia development.((PMID:21258047))Chromatin modifications at both histones and DNA are critical for regulating gene expression. Mis-regulation of such epigenetic marks can lead to pathological states; indeed, cancer affecting the hematopoietic system is frequently linked to epigenetic abnormalities. Here, we discuss the different types of modifications and their general impact on transcription, as well as the polycomb group of proteins, which effect transcriptional repression and are often mis-regulated. Further, we discuss how chromosomal translocations leading to fusion proteins can aberrantly regulate gene transcription through chromatin modifications within the hematopoietic system. PML-RARa, AML1-ETO and MLL-fusions are examples of fusion proteins that mis-regulate epigenetic modifications (either directly or indirectly), which can lead to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms behind the mis-regulation of epigenetic modifications that lead to the development and progression of AMLs could be critical for designing effective treatments.((PMID:18349282))We used MethyLight assays to analyze DNA methylation status of 27 genes on 49 paired cancerous and noncancerous tissue samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent surgical resection. Seven genes (RARB, BVES, CDKN2A, KCNH5, RASSF1, CDH13, and RUNX) were found to be methylated significantly more frequently in tumor tissues than in noncancerous tissues. Only methylation of CCND2 and APC was frequently detected in both cancerous and noncancerous tissues, supporting the hypothesis that the methylation of these two genes is a preneoplastic change and may be associated with tobacco smoking exposure. Methylation of any one of eight genes (RASSF1, DAPK1, BVES, CDH13, MGMT, KCNH5, RARB, or CDH1) was present in 80% of NSCLC tissues but only in 14% of noncancerous tissues. Detection of methylation of these genes in blood might have utility in monitoring and detecting tumor recurrence in early-stage NSCLC after curative surgical resection.((PMID:16613851))MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP are leukemogenic fusion proteins associated with therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia. These proteins are thought to subvert normal gene expression in differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have previously shown that MOZ-TIF2 inhibits transcription by CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300-dependent activators such as nuclear receptors and p53. Here we have shown that MOZ-TIF2 associates with the RARbeta2 promoter in vivo, resulting in altered recruitment of CBP/p300, aberrant histone modification, and down-regulation of the RARbeta2 gene. In contrast, MOZ-TIF2 up-regulated transcription mediated by the MOZ/MYST3-dependent activator AML1/RUNX1. Both wild type MOZ and MOZ-TIF2 were found to colocalize with AML1, and MOZ-TIF2 was recruited to an AML1 target promoter. A MOZ-CBP fusion protein showed similar functions to MOZ-TIF2 in that it inhibited retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription but enhanced AML1 reporter activation. Although it contains almost the entire CBP sequence, MOZ-CBP does not appear to associate with PML bodies. In summary, our results indicate that leukemogenic MOZ fusion proteins have differential effects on the activities of CBP-dependent and MOZ-dependent activators because of their ability to alter cofactor recruitment and chromatin modification at target promoters.((PMID:18767146))The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion is the molecular consequence of the t(12;21)(p13;q22) seen in approximately 25% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Studies have shown that the fusion alone is insufficient for the initiation of leukemia; additional genetic changes are required. Genomic profiling identified copy number alterations at high frequencies in these patients. Focal deletions of TBL1XR1 were observed in 15% of cases; 3 patients exhibited deletions distal to the gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed these deletions and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the TBL1XR1 gene was significantly under-expressed. TBL1XR1 is a key component of the SMRT and N-CoR compressor complexes, which control hormone-receptor mediated gene expression. Differential expression of the retinoic acid target genes, RARB, CRABP1, and CRABP2, indicated that deletion of TBL1XR1 compromised the function of SMRT/N-CoR in the appropriate control of gene expression. This study identifies deletions of TBL1XR1 as a recurrent abnormality in ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL. We provide evidence that implicates this deletion in the inappropriate control of gene expression in these patients. The target of the interaction between TBL1XR1 and the signaling pathways described here may be exploited in cancer therapy.((PMID:21236478))IL-13 is a central mediator of airway responsiveness and mucus expression in patients with allergic airway inflammation, and IL-13 is currently a therapeutic target for asthma. However, little is known about how IL-13 regulates human CD4(+) T-cell lineages because IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) α1, a subunit of IL-13R, has not previously been reported to exist on human T cells.We sought to determine whether human CD4(+) T(H)17 cells express IL-13Rα1 and whether IL-13 regulates T(H)17 cytokine production.Naive human CD4(+) cells were isolated from whole blood, activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and polarized to T(H)1, T(H)2, T(H)17, or induced regulatory T cells in the presence of IL-13 (0-10 ng/mL). Cell supernatants, total RNA, or total protein was examined 4 days after T(H)17 polarization.T(H)17 cells, but not T(H)0, T(H)1, T(H)2, or induced regulatory T cells, expressed IL-13Rα1. IL-13 attenuated IL-17A production, as well as expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor, runt-related transcription factor-1, and interferon regulatory factor 4 in T(H)17-polarized cells. IL-13 neither inhibited IFN-γ production from T(H)1 cells nor inhibited IL-4 production from T(H)2 cells. Furthermore, attenuation of IL-17A production only occurred when IL-13 was present within 24 hours of T-cell activation or at the time of restimulation.IL-13Rα1 is expressed on human CD4(+) T(H)17 cells, and IL-13 attenuates IL-17A production at polarization and restimulation. Although IL-13 is an attractive therapeutic target for decreasing symptoms associated with asthma, these results suggest that therapies inhibiting IL-13 production could have adverse side effects by increasing IL-17A production.((PMID:15963785))Invariant Valpha14i NKT (iNKT) cells are a specialized subset of T lymphocytes with regulatory functions. They coexpress TCRalphabeta and natural killer cell markers. They differentiate through interaction of their Valpha14-Jalpha18 invariant TCRalpha chains with CD1d expressed on double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Although their development has been shown to be thymus dependent, their developmental pathway has not been definitively established. By using genetic analyses, we show here that all iNKT cells are selected from a pool of DP thymocytes. Their development is absolutely dependent on Runx1 and ROR(gamma)t, transcription factors that influence, but are not required for, development of conventional T cells. Our results indicate that even though CD1d binding DP thymocytes have yet to be observed, Valpha14-Jalpha18 rearrangement in these cells is required for development of iNKT cells.((PMID:21746882))A new class of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) (termed Th17) has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.((PMID:16195230))Osteopontin (OPN), a glycosylated phosphoprotein that binds calcium, is present in bone extracellular matrix and has been reported to modulate both mineralization and bone resorption. Targeted disruption in mice of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) or Runx2 results in marked inhibition of OPN expression in osteoblasts. In this study, we addressed possible cross-talk between VDR and Runx2 in regulating OPN transcription. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) or Runx2 stimulated OPN transcription (mouse OPN promoter -777/+79) 2-3-fold. However, coexpression of Runx2 and VDR in COS-7 cells and treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) resulted in an 8-fold induction of OPN transcription, indicating for the first time functional cooperation between Runx2 and VDR in the regulation of OPN transcription. In ROS 17/2.8 and MC3T3-E1 cells that contain endogenous Runx2, AML-1/ETO, which acts as a repressor of Runx2, significantly inhibited 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induction of OPN transcription, OPN mRNA, and protein expression. Both a Runx2 site (-136/-130) and the vitamin D response element (-757/-743) in the OPN promoter are needed for cooperative activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can enhance VDR and Runx2 recruitment on the OPN promoter, further indicating cooperation between these two factors in the regulation of OPN. In osteoblastic cells, Hes-1, a downstream factor of the Notch signaling pathway, was found to enhance basal and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced OPN transcription. This enhancement was inhibited by AML-1/ETO, an inhibitor of Runx2. Immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Hes-1 and Runx2 interact and that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can enhance this interaction. Taken together, these findings define novel mechanisms involving the intersection of three pathways, Runx2, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and Notch signaling, that play a major role in the regulation of OPN in osteoblastic cells and therefore in the process of bone remodeling.((PMID:20236534))The mineralized skeleton is a major evolutionary novelty that has contributed to the impressive morphological diversifications of the vertebrates. Essential to bone biology is the solidified extracellular matrix secreted by highly specialized cells, the osteoblasts. We now have a rather complete view of the events underlying osteogenesis, from a cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic perspective. Because this knowledge is still largely restricted to mammals, it is difficult, if not impossible, to deduce the evolutionary history of the regulatory network involved in osteoblasts specification and differentiation. In this study, we focused on the transcriptional regulators Runx2 and VDR (the Vitamin D Receptor) that, in mammals, directly interact together and stabilize complexes of co-activators and chromatin remodellers, thereby allowing the transcriptional activation of target genes involved in extracellular matrix mineralization. Using a combination of functional, biochemical, and histological approaches, we have asked if the interaction observed between Runx2 and VDR represents a recent mammalian innovation, or if it results from more ancient changes that have occurred deep in the vertebrate lineage.Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in developing embryos of chick, frog and teleost fishes, we have revealed that the co-expression of Runx2 and VDR in skeletal elements has been particularly strengthened in the lineage leading to amniotes. We show that the teleost Runx2 orthologue as well as the three mammalian Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 paralogues are able to co-immunoprecipitate with the VDR protein present in nuclear extracts of rat osteoblasts stimulated with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, the teleost Runx2 can activate the transcription of the mammalian osteocalcin promoter in transfection experiments, and this response can be further enhanced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Finally, using pull-down experiments between recombinant proteins, we show that the VDR homologue from teleosts, but not from ascidians, is able to directly interact with the mammalian Runx2 homologue.We propose an evolutionary scenario for the assembly of the molecular machinery involving Runx2 and VDR in vertebrates. In the last common ancestor of actinopterygians and sacropterygians, the three Runx paralogues possessed the potential to physically and functionally interact with the VDR protein. Therefore, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 might have been able to modulate the transcriptional activity of Runx1, Runx2 or Runx3 in the tissues expressing VDR. After the split from amphibians, in the lineage leading to amniotes, Runx2 and VDR became robustly co-expressed in developing skeletal elements, and their regulatory interaction was incorporated in the genetic program involved in the specification and differentiation of osteoblasts.((PMID:24263100))MicroRNAs are key regulators of many biological processes, including cell differentiation. These small RNAs exert their function assembled in the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), where members of Argonaute (Ago) family of proteins provide a unique platform for target recognition and gene silencing. Here, by using myeloid cell lines and primary blasts, we show that Ago2 has a key role in human monocytic cell fate determination and in LPS-induced inflammatory response of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3)-treated myeloid cells. The silencing of Ago2 impairs the D3-dependent miR-17-5p/20a/106a, miR-125b and miR-155 downregulation, the accumulation of their translational targets AML1, VDR and C/EBPβ and monocytic cell differentiation. Moreover, we show that Ago2 is recruited on miR-155 host gene promoter and on the upstream region of an overlapping antisense lncRNA, determining their epigenetic silencing, and miR-155 downregulation. These findings highlight Ago2 as a new factor in myeloid cell fate determination in acute myeloid leukemia cells.((PMID:17244680))Alteration of lineage-specific transcriptional programs for hematopoiesis causes differentiation block and promotes leukemia development. Here, we show that AML1/ETO, the most common translocation fusion product in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), counteracts the activity of retinoic acid (RA), a transcriptional regulator of myelopoiesis. AML1/ETO participates in a protein complex with the RA receptor alpha (RARalpha) at RA regulatory regions on RARbeta2, which is a key RA target gene mediating RA activity/resistance in cells. At these sites, AML1/ETO recruits histone deacetylase, DNA methyltransferase, and DNA-methyl-CpG binding activities that promote a repressed chromatin conformation. The link among AML1/ETO, heterochromatic RARbeta2 repression, RA resistance, and myeloid differentiation block is indicated by the ability of either siRNA-AML1/ETO or the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine to revert these epigenetic alterations and to restore RA differentiation response in AML1/ETO blasts. Finally, RARbeta2 is commonly silenced by hypermethylation in primary AML blasts but not in normal hematopoietic precursors, thus suggesting a role for the epigenetic repression of the RA signaling pathway in myeloid leukemogenesis.((PMID:19536094))The human death-associated protein 3 (hDAP3) is a GTP-binding constituent of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome with a pro-apoptotic function.A search through publicly available microarray data sets showed 337 genes potentially coregulated with the DAP3 gene. The promoter sequences of these 337 genes and 70 out of 85 mitochondrial ribosome genes were analysed in silico with the DAP3 gene promoter sequence. The mitochondrial role of DAP3 was also investigated in the thyroid tumours presenting various mitochondrial contents.The study revealed nine transcription factors presenting enriched motifs for these gene promoters, five of which are implicated in cellular growth (ELK1, ELK4, RUNX1, HOX11-CTF1, TAL1-ternary complex factor 3) and four in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), GABPA, PPARG-RXRA and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA)). An independent microarray data set showed the overexpression of ELK1, RUNX1 and ESRRA in the thyroid oncocytic tumours. Exploring the thyroid tumours, we found that DAP3 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in tumours presenting a mitochondrial biogenesis compared with the normal tissue. ELK1 and ESRRA were also showed upregulated with DAP3.ELK1 and ESRRA may be considered as potential regulators of the DAP3 gene expression. DAP3 may participate in mitochondrial maintenance and play a role in the balance between mitochondrial homoeostasis and tumourigenesis.((PMID:27089330))miRNAs have been widely investigated in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about their effects on bird growth. Here we characterized the promoter of miR-206 in chicken and found that the preferable promoter was located in 1200 bp upstream of pri-miR-206. In this region, many key transcription factors, including MyoD, c-Myb, CEBPα/β, AP-4, RAP1, Brn2, GATA-1/2/3, E47, Sn, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and CdxA, were predicted to bind and interact with miR-206 promoter. Overexpression of MyoD sharply increased miR-206 expression in both fibroblast and myoblast cells, and also the regulation in the myoblast cells was much stronger, indicating that miR-206 was regulated by MyoD combined with other muscle specific transcriptional factors. Aiming to further investigate the relationship between miR-206 mutation and transcriptional expression, total of 23 SNPs were identified in the two distinct bird lines by sequencing. Interestingly, the motif bound by MyoD was individually destroyed by G-to-C mutation located at 419 bp upstream of miR-206 precursor. Co-transfecting MyoD and miR-206 promoter in DF-1 cells, the luciferase activity of promoter containing homozygous GG types was significantly higher than CC ones (p < 0.05). Thus, this mutation caused low expression of miR-206. Consistently, eight variants including G-419C mutation exhibited a great effect on birthweight through maker-trait association analysis in F2 population (p < 0.05). Additionally, the regulation of miR-206 on embryo muscle mass mainly by increasing MyoG and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) expression (p < 0.05) with little change in MyoD, TMEM8C and myosin heavy chain (MHC). In conclusion, our findings provide a novel mutation destroying the promoter activity of miR-206 in birds and shed new light to understand the regulation mechanism of miR-206 on the embryonic muscle growth.((PMID:26226650))Phenoloxidases (POs) play key roles in various physiological functions in insects, e.g., cuticular sclerotization, wound healing, egg tanning, cuticle formation and melanotic encapsulaction of pathogens. Previously, we identified five POs, designated As-pro-PO I-V, from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus and demonstrated that the functions of As-pro-PO I, II and III, were associated with filarial parasite melanization, blood feeding and cuticle formation, respectively. In the present study, we delineate the dual functions of As-pro-PO V. We found that the level of As-pro-PO V mRNA in mosquitoes was significantly increased after microfilaria challenge or blood feeding, and decreased to normal level after oviposition. Knockdown of As-pro-PO V by dsRNA resulted in significant decreases in the degree of microfilaria melanization, egg chronic melanization rates and egg hatching rates in Ar. subalbatus. Further transfection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays verified the As-pro-PO V gene might regulated by both AP-1, a putative immune-related regulatory element and CdxA, a developmental regulatory element. The binding of AP-1 and CdxA motif with mosquito nuclear extracts was significantly enhanced after microfilaria challenge and blood-feeding in Ar. subalbatus, respectively. These results indicate that As-pro-PO V is a critical enzyme that is required for both an effective melanization immune response and egg chorion melanization in this mosquito.((PMID:25024040))Our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p = 0.0007, OR = 0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.74; rs2738081, p = 0.0003, OR = 0.72; rs2738058, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.73; rs4288398, p = 0.0008, OR = 0.78; rs6984215, p = 0.002, OR = 0.63; rs12716641, p = 0.00002, OR = 0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chinese.((PMID:24880497))This study examined the associations between vitamin D status, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and markers of calcium homeostasis in preschool-aged children. Children (n=488; age range: 1.8-6.0 y) were randomly recruited from Montreal. The distal forearm was scanned using a peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (Lunar PIXI; GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). A subset (n=81) had clinical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) scans (Hologic 4500A Discovery Series) of lumbar spine (LS) 1-4, whole body, and ultradistal forearm. All were assessed for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone concentrations (Liaison; Diasorin), ionized calcium (ABL80 FLEX; Radiometer Medical A/S), and dietary vitamin D and calcium intakes by survey. Age (p<0.001) and weight-for-age Z-score (p<0.001) were positively associated with BMC and aBMD in all regression models, whereas male sex contributed positively to forearm BMC and aBMD. Having a 25(OH)D concentration of >75 nmol/L positively associated with forearm and whole body BMC and aBMD (p<0.036). Sun index related to (p<0.029) cDXA forearm and LS 1-4 BMC and whole-body aBMD. Nutrient intakes did not relate to BMC or aBMD. In conclusion, higher vitamin D status is linked to higher BMC and aBMD of forearm and whole body in preschool-aged children.((PMID:24287273))Helicobacter pylori encoded CagA is presently the only known virulence factor that is injected into gastric epithelial cells where it destroys apical junctional complexes and induces dedifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells, leading to H. pylori-related gastric carcinogensis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which CagA mediates these changes. Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor highly expressed in multistage tissues of dysplasia and cancer. One specific target of Cdx2, Claudin-2, is involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In this study, our findings showed that the activity of Cdx2 binding to Cdx binding sites of CdxA (GTTTATG) and CdxB (TTTTAGG) of probes corresponding to claudin-2 flanking region increased in AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain. Moreover, Cdx2 upregulated claudin-2 expression at transcriptional level and translational level. In the meantime, we found that TJs of AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain, were more severely destroyed, leading to wider cell gap, interference of contact, scattering and highly elevated migration of cells. Herein, this study is firstly demonstrated that H. pylori-encoded CagA disrupts TJs and induces invasiveness of AGS gastric carcinoma cells via Cdx2-dependent targeting of Claudin-2. This provides a new mechanism whereby CagA induced dedifferentiation of AGS cells, leading to malignant behavior of biology.((PMID:23612636))There are few large-scale studies on the utility of peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) in children. As central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) equipment is not commonly available in the developing world, we assessed the correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) with cDXA and pDXA in children to determine the optimal Z-score thresholds of pDXA for predicting two predefined Z-score cutoffs (≤-1, ≤-2) of cDXA in 844 subjects (441 boys, 403 girls) aged 10-18 years. The BMD of antero-posterior lumbar spine (L1-L4), proximal femur and forearm was measured by cDXA, while the peripheral BMD of forearm and calcaneus was estimated using pDXA. The correlation was statistically significant at all sites (p<0.01). The coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.79 in boys and 0.17 to 0.32 in girls. A significant positive correlation was observed between BMD by pDXA and cDXA in Indian children, with a strong gender difference in both the extent of correlation and the ability of peripheral BMD to predict central BMD.((PMID:23534754))The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine-like molecule that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reactions and Western blot assays indicated that HMGB1 transcriptional activity and protein level are increased in Tax+-T cells (TaxP). To clarify the mechanisms, a series of HMGB1 deletion reporter plasmids (pHLuc1 to pHLuc6) were transfected into Tax--T cells (TaxN, Jurkat) and Tax+-T cells (TaxP). We found that promoter activity in Tax+-T cells to be higher than that in Tax--T cells, indicating a significant increase in pHLuc6. Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) treatment did not block the enhancing effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Tax was retained on a HMGB1 promoter fragment encompassing -1163 to -975. Bioinformatics analysis showed six characteristic cis-elements for CdxA, AP-1, AML-1a, USF, v-Myb, and C/EBP in the fragment in question. Mutation of cis- elements for C/EBP reduced significant HMGB1 promoter activity induced by Tax. These findings indicate that Tax enhances the expression of HMGB1 gene at the transcriptional level, possibly by interacting with C/EBP.((PMID:23454006))Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a multi-functional transcription factor in the IRF family exhibiting both transcriptional activating and repressing activities. In this study, an IRF-2 gene (HcIRF-2) from Hyriopsis cumingii was identified and characterized. The cDNA sequence consisted of 2688 bp, encoding a 329 amino acid-protein. The amino acid sequence had a highly conserved N-terminal DBD structure, containing characteristic repeats of six tryptophan residues. The 5'-flanking region contained several transcription regulation elements such as AP1, CdxA, HSF, NIT2 and HNF-3b. Nine SNPs were obtained through direct sequencing of HcIRF-2 from resistant and susceptible stock. Only +2365T/C SNP was significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to Aeromonas hydrophila both in genotype (P = 0.021) and allele (P = 0.006) analysis. The SNPs +2248T/C and +2365T/C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TT frequency in the resistant group was significantly higher than in the susceptible group. The mortality in +2248CC genotype individuals was significantly higher than in CT and TT genotype individuals. These results indicated that haplotype TT and genotype +2248CT and +2248GT individuals were resistant to A. hydrophila, which could make them potential markers in selective breeding of H. cumingii.((PMID:23208143))Based on the cDNA sequence of GPX in Hyriopsis cumingii, the complete genomic DNA of GPX gene and it's 5'-flanking region were identified from H. cumingii using PCR and genome walking technique. The length of the complete genomic sequence was 6 708 bp including the 5'-flanking region, two exons, and one intron. Sequence analysis of the 992 bp 5'-flanking region revealed that it contained a core promoter element (TATA-box) and other transcription regulation elements such as AP1, C/EBP, and CdxA. The sequence lengths of the two exons were 273 bp and 991 bp, respectively, and the intron was 4 491 bp in length. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the GPX gene from resistant stock (RS) and susceptible stock (SS) of H. cumingii. These polymorphisms were analyzed with regard to resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila. Among them, three SNPs including A-99G, A-86C, and A-49C in GPX promoter and five SNPs including A2841T, C2847T, G3146C, A3150G, and G4645T in GPX introns were associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to A. hydrophila, both in genotype and allele frequency. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that A-86C, A-49C, C2847T, A3150G, G4645T, A2841T, and G3146C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (ACTGT and TG) in the resistant group was significantly higher than that in the susceptible group. The results suggest that the polymorphic loci in the GPX gene could be potential genetic markers for future molecular selection of strains resistant to diseases.((PMID:22578123))Investigating intestinal physiology in vitro remains challenging due to the lack of an effective primary enterocyte culture system. Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroids.((PMID:25049581))The production of therapeutic proteins from transgenic animals is one of the most important successes of animal biotechnology. Milk is presently the most mature system for production of therapeutic proteins from a transgenic animal. Specifically, β-casein is a major component of cow, goat and sheep milk, and its promoter has been used to regulate the expression of transgenic genes in the mammary gland of transgenic animals. Here, we cloned the porcine β-casein gene and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the promoter and intron 1 region of the porcine β-casein gene. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including SRY, CdxA, AML-a, GATA-3, GATA-1 and C/EBP β. In addition, the first intron of the porcine β-casein gene contained the transcriptional enhancers Oct-1, SRY, YY1, C/EBP β, and AP-1, as well as the retroviral TATA box. We estimated the transcriptional activity for the 5'-proximal region with or without intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene in HC11 cells stimulated with lactogenic hormones. High transcriptional activity was obtained for the 5'-proximal region with intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene. The β-casein gene containing the mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) was also cloned from another individual pig. Promoter activity of the luciferase vector containing the mutant TATA box was weaker than the same vector containing the normal TATA box. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transcription of porcine β-casein gene is regulated by lactogenic hormone via intron 1 and promoter containing a mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) has poor porcine β-casein gene activity.((PMID:22232350))To examine whether PARK16, which was recently identified as a protective locus for Parkinson disease (PD) in Asian, white, and South American populations, is also associated with PD in the genetically homogeneous Ashkenazi Jewish population.Case-control study.A medical center affiliated with a university. Subjects  Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located between RAB7L1 and SLC41A1 were analyzed in 720 patients with PD and 642 controls, all of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.Haplotypes were defined and risk estimates were determined for each SNP and haplotype. Bioinformatic analysis defined the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and the transcription factor binding sites that are potentially affected by 2 of the tested SNPs.All tested SNPs were significantly associated with PD (odds ratios = 0.64-0.76; P = .0002-.014). Two of them, rs1572931 and rs823144, were localized to the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and their sequence variations altered the predicted transcription factor binding sites of CdxA, p300, GATA-1, Sp1, and c-Ets-1. Only 0.4% of patients were homozygous for the protective rs1572931 genotype (T/T), compared with 3.0% among controls (P = 5 × 10(-5)). This SNP was included in a haplotype that reduced the risk for PD by 10- to 12-fold (P = .002-.01) in all patients with PD and in a subgroup of patients who do not carry the Ashkenazi founder mutations in the GBA or LRRK2 genes.Our data demonstrate that specific SNP variations and haplotypes in the PARK16 locus are associated with reduced risk for PD in Ashkenazim. Although it is possible that alterations in the putative promoter of RAB7L1 are associated with this effect, the role of other genes in this locus cannot be ruled out.((PMID:21948744))Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is a key element of D-type cyclin holoenzymes. It is involved in the regulation of the G1-phase of the cell cycle and is considered to be an important candidate gene for selection of body measurement traits through marker-assisted selection. We cloned the promoter sequence of this gene in bovines and found it to share high similarity with that of the human CDK6 promoter. A 2271-bp sequence upstream of the start codon in the bovine CDK6 5'-flanking sequence is rich in GC; it lacks consensus TATA or CAAT box, but it contains several MZF1 binding sites. Other potential cis-regulatory elements were found in the 5'-flanking region, including CdxA, SRY, p300, GATA-1, and deltaE. Allele frequencies were also analyzed in various cattle breeds (Qinchuan, Qinchuan improvement steers, Nanyang, Jiaxian red, Xia'nan, Luxi, Simmental and Luxi crossbred steers, and Xuelong) and association with a selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was calculated. The T-1075C SNP in the promoter was found to be significantly associated with body length and heart girth. This SNP marker was found to be significantly associated with body length and the heart girth in 737 individuals. We conclude that this SNP of the CDK6 gene has potential as a genetic marker for important body traits in bovine reproduction and breeding.((PMID:21191598))Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method to assess bone mineral density (BMD). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends the measurement of BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, but in certain circumstances the 33% radius may be the recommended area to measure BMD. The aim of this study has been to analyze whether 33% radius should be considered the recommended area to assess BMD in prostate cancer patients.This is a retrospective study where BMD was assessed by DXA at 33% radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck (cDXA) in 141 prostate cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients were hormone naïve while 113 were subjected to androgen suppression (AS) during the mean period of 29 months. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when T-score was lower than -2.5 and osteopenia when it ranged between -1 and -2.5.The osteoporosis rate was 29.8% at 33% radius, 23.4% at femoral neck, 19.9% at lumbar spine, and 12.8% at total hip. The overall osteoporosis rate at cDXA was 29.1%. Osteoporosis was detected in 52.2% at 33% radius and 36.2% at cDXA. Normal BMD was found in 17.7% at 33% radius and 34.8% at cDXA. The 33% radius was the only site where a significant increase in the osteoporosis rate was detected in patients subjected to AS compared to those hormone naïve (33 and 13.8%).The 33% radius seems more sensible than the central skeleton areas to detect bone mass loss in patients with prostate cancer.((PMID:20922565))Alkaline phosphatases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in many important biological processes. Mammalian tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase has long been thought to feature in embryonic development and bone formation. In this study, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene from Paralichthys olivaceus was identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and genome-walking PCR. The ALP gene extends 10,141 bp and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The open reading frame of the ALP transcript consists of 1,431 bp, which encodes 476 amino acids products named as POALP. An analysis of its secondary and tertiary structure revealed that the POALP was conserved in different species, but one disulfide linkage made it possible to adapt to low-temperature environment. The ALP activity was found to be first detectable in the embryo before hatching. The POALP was distributed ubiquitously in the body of P. olivaceus and was particularly high in the digestive tract. These findings suggest the potential role of POALP in nutrient absorption and transportation. During the pre-metamorphosis (F stage), ALP gene expression is 2.5-folds of that in the pro-metamorphosis (E stage); but in the post-metamorphosis (I stage), it was 1.8-folds of that of pro-metamorphosis. Exogenetic thyroxine (T4) and thiourea (TU) influenced the ALP gene expression significantly during the metamorphosis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that Japanese flounder ALP promoter region contained promoter sequence and putative recognition site for several transcriptional factors, including SREBP-1, SYR, and CdxA. In vitro promoter assays employing EGFP reporter system demonstrated that the promoter of ALP was active.((PMID:20190048))Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and contributes to the degradation of hemicellulose in the rumen. The genome of P. bryantii harbors four genes predicted to encode glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 (GH3) enzymes. To evaluate whether these genes encode enzymes with redundant biological functions, each gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that the enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities. One gene encoded a cellodextrinase (CdxA), and three genes encoded beta-xylosidase enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B, and Xyl3C) with different specificities for either para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates or substituted xylooligosaccharides. To identify the amino acid residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity within this family of enzymes, the roles of conserved residues (R177, K214, H215, M251, and D286) in Xyl3B were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation led to a severely decreased catalytic efficiency without a change in the overall structure of the mutant enzymes. Through amino acid sequence alignments, an amino acid residue (E115) that, when mutated to aspartic acid, resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX) with a concurrent 1.1-fold increase in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was identified. Amino acid residue E115 may therefore contribute to the discrimination between beta-xylosides and beta-glucosides. Our results demonstrate that each of the four GH3 enzymes has evolved to perform a specific role in lignopolysaccharide hydrolysis and provide insight into the role of active-site residues in catalysis and substrate specificity for GH3 enzymes.((PMID:20025925))More than ten bradykinin-related peptides and their cDNAs have been identified from amphibians, but their genes are unknown. In present study, four cDNAs encoding one, two, four and six copies of bradykinin-related peptides were cloned from the frog (Odorrana grahami) skin cDNA library, respectively. Three bradykinin-related peptides (bradykinin, Thr6-bradykinin, Leu5Thr6-bradykinin) were deduced from these four cDNA sequences. Based on the cDNA sequence, the gene sequence encoding an amphibian bradykinin-related peptide from O. grahami was determined. It is composed of 7481 base pairs including two exons and two introns. The first exon codes signal peptide and the second exon codes acidic spacer peptide and Thr6-bradykinin. The promoter region of the bradykinin gene contains several putative recognition sites for nuclear factors, such as SRY, GATA-1, LYF-1, DeltaE, CDXA, NKX-2.5, MIF1 and S8. The current work may facilitate to understand the regulation and possible functions of amphibian skin bradykinin-related peptides.((PMID:19826915))Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes, has been implicated in virus and double-stranded RNA mediated induction of IFN-α, IFN-β and RANTES, in virus-induced apoptosis and in tumor suppression. Promoter plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, but the characterization of the human IRF-3 promoter has not been systematically analyzed in HEK 293 cells. To characterize the human IRF-3 promoter, we have isolated a genomic clone of the human IRF-3 gene promoter region containing 1,000 nucleotides of the 5'- flanking region. Transient transfection of 5'-deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region -149/-93 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for full promoter activity. This region contains HSF, E2F, CdxA and c-Myb transcription factor binding sites. The E2F sites are highly conserved among IRF-3 promoter regions of mouse, rat and human. Therefore, it was suggested that this E2F site may be essential for basal promoter activity. Surprisingly, mutation of this E2F site increased the promoter activity by 2-fold. Furthermore, overexpression of E2F1 reduced the transcription activity by 80%. These results indicated that human IRF-3 gene core promoter was located within the region -149/-93 relative to the TSS. E2F1 transcription factor negatively regulates human IRF-3 gene promoter.((PMID:19516907))Endoderm organ primordia become specified between gastrulation and gut tube folding in Amniotes. Although the requirement for RA signaling for the development of a few individual endoderm organs has been established a systematic assessment of its activity along the entire antero-posterior axis has not been performed in this germ layer.RA is synthesized from gastrulation to somitogenesis in the mesoderm that is close to the developing gut tube. In the branchial arch region specific levels of RA signaling control organ boundaries. The most anterior endoderm forming the thyroid gland is specified in the absence of RA signaling. Increasing RA in anterior branchial arches results in thyroid primordium repression and the induction of more posterior markers such as branchial arch Hox genes. Conversely reducing RA signaling shifts Hox genes posteriorly in endoderm. These results imply that RA acts as a caudalizing factor in a graded manner in pharyngeal endoderm. Posterior foregut and midgut organ primordia also require RA, but exposing endoderm to additional RA is not sufficient to expand these primordia anteriorly. We show that in chick, in contrast to non-Amniotes, RA signaling is not only necessary during gastrulation, but also throughout gut tube folding during somitogenesis. Our results show that the induction of CdxA, a midgut marker, and pancreas induction require direct RA signaling in endoderm. Moreover, communication between CdxA(+) cells is necessary to maintain CdxA expression, therefore synchronizing the cells of the midgut primordium. We further show that the RA pathway acts synergistically with FGF4 in endoderm patterning rather than mediating FGF4 activity.Our work establishes that retinoic acid (RA) signaling coordinates the position of different endoderm organs along the antero-posterior axis in chick embryos and could serve as a basis for the differentiation of specific endodermal organs from ES cells.((PMID:18448117))Gene regulation during development is an important biological activity that leads to synthesis of biomolecules at specific locations and specific times. The single tropomyosin gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, tmy-1/lev-11, produces four isoforms of protein: two from the external promoter and two from the internal promoter. We investigated the internal promoter of tropomyosin to identify sequences that regulate expression of tmy-1 in the pharynx and intestine. By promoter deletion of tmy-1 reporters as well as by database analyses, a 100-bp fragment that contained binding sequences for a GATA factor, for a chicken CdxA homolog, and for a forkhead factor was identified. Both the forkhead and CdxA binding sequences contributed to pharyngeal and intestinal expression. In addition, the GATA site also influenced intestinal expression of tmy-1 reporter. We showed that ELT-2 and PHA-4 proteins interact directly with the GATA and forkhead binding sequences, respectively, in gel mobility shift assays. RNA interference knockdown of elt-2 diminished tmy-1::gfp expression in the intestine. In contrast to RNA interference knockdown of pha-4, expression of tmy-1::gfp in pha-4;smg-1 mutants was slightly weaker than that of the wild type. Ectopic expression of PHA-4 and ELT-2 by heat shock was sufficient to elicit widespread expression of tmy-1::lacZ reporter in embryos. We found no indication of a synergistic relation between ELT-2 and PHA-4. Based on our data, PHA-4 and CdxA function as general transcription factors for pharyngeal and intestinal regulation of tmy-1. We present models by which ELT-2, PHA-4, and CdxA orchestrate expression from the internal promoter of tmy-1.((PMID:12828791))Ingestion of carbohydrates from the small intestine is the major route of energy supply in animals. In mammals these functions develop both pre- and postnatally and are coordinated for the sucking period. In birds, the physiological requirements are different and hatchlings ingest diets rich in complex carbohydrates soon after hatching. The present study examined the ontogeny of intestinal carbohydrate uptake in the chicken. The expression of mRNA for a brush border enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase (SI), which is critical in disaccharide digestion, was determined, together with that of the Na-glucose transporter (SGLT)-1, which is the major apical glucose transporter, In addition, the homeobox gene cdx, which is involved in inducing SI expression in mammals was examined. It was found that the expression of cdxA mRNA and cdxA protein increased from day 15 of incubation until hatch, after which further changes were small. CdxA protein was shown to bind to the promoter region of SI in the chick indicating that cdxA is similar to the mammalian cdx2. The mRNA of SI was observed at 15 d incubation, increased from 17 d of incubation to a peak on day 19, decreased at hatch and had a further peak of expression 2 d post-hatch. In contrast, the mRNA of SGLT-1 was not detected until 19 d of incubation when a major peak of expression was observed followed by a decrease to low levels at hatch and small increases post-hatch. It appears that both SI and SGLT-1 mRNA are expressed before hatch in the chick, but the ontogeny of expression is controlled by different mechanisms.((PMID:8016095))The immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, E12 and E47, encoded by the E2A gene belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of regulatory proteins and act as transcriptional activators. In addition to their critical role in B-lymphocyte development, the E12 and E47 proteins have been implicated in the induction of myogenesis as heterodimeric partners of myogenic bHLH proteins, MyoD and myogenin. Here we demonstrate that the E2A proteins form heterodimers with the bHLH oncoprotein tal-1 in myeloid and erythroid cells and that these heterodimers specifically bind to the CANNTG DNA motif. Heterodimerization with tal-1 represses transactivation by E47 and could function to prevent the expression of immunoglobulin genes in cells other than B lymphocytes. DNA binding by E2A-tal-1 heterodimers in the M1 mouse myeloid cell line is abrogated upon terminal macrophage differentiation induced by the cytokine interleukin 6. The loss of E2A-tal-1 DNA binding is correlated with elevated expression of mRNA encoding the dominant negative HLH proteins, Id1 and particularly Id2. Moreover, recombinant Id proteins inhibit the E2A-tal-1-specific DNA binding activity from undifferentiated M1 cells. These results suggest that E2A-tal-1 heterodimers may play a role in preventing terminal differentiation in the myeloid lineage and provide a possible explanation for oncogenic transformation induced by ectopic tal-1 expression in acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias.((PMID:22311016))Meat quality traits are economically important traits of swine, and are controlled by multiple genes as complex quantitative traits. In the present study four genes, H-FABP (heart fatty acid-binding protein), MASTR (MEF2 activating motif and SAP domain containing transcriptional regulator), UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3) and MYOD1 (myogenic differentiation 1) were researched in Large White pigs. The polymorphisms H-FABP T/C of 5'UTR, MYOD1 g.257 A>C, UCP3 g.1406 G>A in exon 3 and MASTR c.187 C>T have been reported to be associated with meat quality traits in pigs. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of single and multiple markers for single traits in Large White pigs. The single marker association analysis showed that the H-FABP and MASTR genes were associated with IMF (intramuscular fat content) (P < 0.05), and that the g.257 A>C of MYOD1 gene was most significantly related to muscle pH value (P < 0.01). The multiple markers for IMF were analyzed by combining the markers and quantitative trait modes into the linear regression. The results revealed that H-FABP and MASTR integrate gene networks for IMF. Thus, our study results suggested that H-FABP and MASTR polymorphisms could be used as genetic markers in the marker-assisted selection towards the improvement of IMF in Large White pigs.((PMID:9118219))We isolated a Xenopus homolog of Frzb, a newly described protein containing an amino-terminal Frizzled motif. It dorsalized Xenopus embryos and was expressed in the Spemann organizer during early gastrulation. Unlike Frizzled proteins, endogenous Frzb was soluble. Frzb was secretable and could act across cell boundaries. In several functional assays, Frzb antagonized Xwnt-8, a proposed ventralizing factor with an expression pattern complementary to that of Frzb. Furthermore, Frzb blocked induction of MyoD, an action reported recently for a dominant-negative Xwnt-8. Frzb coimmunoprecipitated with Wnt proteins, providing direct biochemical evidence for Frzb-Wnt interactions. These observations implicate Frzb in axial patterning and support the concept that Frzb binds and inactivates Xwnt-8 during gastrulation, preventing inappropriate ventral signaling in developing dorsal tissues.((PMID:7665172))Transcription factors containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif regulate the expression of tissue-specific genes in a number of mammalian and insect systems. DNA-binding activity of the bHLH proteins is dependent upon formation of homo- and/or heterodimers. Dominant negative HLH proteins (Id-related genes) also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the DNA-binding basic domain. Consequently, Id proteins inhibit binding to DNA and transcriptional transactivation by heterodimerization with bHLH proteins. We report here the cDNA sequence of a novel human HLH gene (HGMW-approved symbol ID4) that lacks the basic domain. ID4 is differentially expressed in adult organs in four mRNA molecules, which are presumably a result of differential splicing and/or alternative usage of the polyadenylation sites. Transfection experiments indicated that enforced expression of Id-4H protein inhibits the trans-activation of the muscle creatine kinase E-box enhancer by MyoD. Finally, we localized the ID4 gene to the chromosome 6p21-p22 region.((PMID:8918463))The three ternary complex factors (TCFs), Net (ERP/ SAP-2), ELK-1 and SAP-1, are highly related ets oncogene family members that participate in the response of the cell to Ras and growth signals. Understanding the different roles of these factors will provide insights into how the signals result in coordinate regulation of the cell. We show that Net inhibits transcription under basal conditions, in which SAP-1a is inactive and ELK-1 stimulates. Repression is mediated by the NID, the Net Inhibitory Domain of about 50 amino acids, which autoregulates the Net protein and also inhibits when it is isolated in a heterologous fusion protein. Net is particularly sensitive to Ras activation. Ras activates Net through the C-domain, which is conserved between the three TCFs, and the NID is an efficient inhibitor of Ras activation. The NID, as well as more C-terminal sequences, inhibit DNA binding. Net is more refractory to DNA binding than the other TCFs, possibly due to the presence of multiple inhibitory elements. The NID may adopt a helix-loop-helix (HLH) structure, as evidenced by homology to other HLH motifs, structure predictions, model building and mutagenesis of critical residues. The sequence resemblance with myogenic factors suggested that Net may form complexes with the same partners. Indeed, we found that Net can interact in vivo with the basic HLH factor, E47. We propose that Net is regulated at the level of its latent DNA-binding activity by protein interactions and/or phosphorylation. Net may form complexes with HLH proteins as well as SRF on specific promotor sequences. The identification of the novel inhibitory domain provides a new inroad into exploring the different roles of the ternary complex factors in growth control and transformation.((PMID:27565872))I-mfa (inhibitor of the MyoD family a) is a transcription modulator that binds to MyoD family members and inhibits their transcriptional activities. It is highly expressed in the sclerotome and plays an important role in the patterning of the somite early in development. In this study, the polymorphisms of the bovine I-mfa gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA pool sequencing methods in 541 individuals from three Chinese cattle breeds. The results showed that P3 locus had two novel complete linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (NC_007324.4:g.12284A>G and g.12331T>C), resulting in a missense mutation p.S(AGC)113G(GGC) and a synonymous mutation p.H(CAT)128H(CAC), respectively. P4 locus had a novel SNP (NC_007324.4: g.16432C>A), which resulted in a nonsense mutation p.C(TGC)241X(TGA). The statistical analyses indicated that the three SNPs, are associated with the phenotypic traits in Luxi (LX), Qinchuan (QC), and Jiaxian (JX) cattle population (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The mutant-type variants were superior for growth traits; the heterozygote diplotype was associated with higher growth traits compared to wild-type homozygote. Our results provide evidence that polymorphisms in the I-mfa gene are associated with growth traits and may be used for marker-assisted selection in beef cattle breeding program.((PMID:27279047))Accumulating evidence suggests that Sirtuin (Sirt)1 serves a significant role in proliferation and differentiation of myoblast cells; however the signaling mechanisms involved remain to be established. Myostatin (MSTN), a member of transforming growth factor‑β family, is an vital regulator of myoblast, fibroblast growth and differentiation. To determine if MSTN is involved in the regulation of myoblast cell proliferation by Sirt1, the present study administrated the Sirt1 activator resveratrol, inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) and MSTN inhibitor SB431542 to C2C12 myoblast cells. It was demonstrated that the Sirt1 activator, resveratrol, repressed, whereas the Sirt1 inhibitor, NAM, enhanced C2C12 myoblast cells proliferation in a Sirt1‑dependent manner. SB431542 promoted the proliferation of C2C12 myoblast cells and reversed the inhibition effect of NAM on C2C12 myoblast cell proliferation. Additionally, resveratrol upregulated the mRNA expression of MyoD, but inhibited the expression of MSTN. Additionally, NAM significantly repressed the expression of MyoD and the phosphorylation of P107 (p‑P107), but enhanced the expression of MSTN and the protein expression of P107. SB431542 significantly mitigated the effect of NAM on the expression of MyoD, P107 and p‑P107. Taken together, these results indicated that Sirt1 promotes the proliferation of C2C12 myoblast cells via the MSTN signaling pathway.((PMID:27178573))Marek's disease (MD) is an infectious disease of chickens caused by MD virus (MDV), which is a herpesvirus that initiates tumor formation. Studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are linked with the development of cancers or tumors. Previously, gga-miR-130a was discovered downregulated in MDV-infected tissues. Here, we aimed to explore the further function of gga-miR-130a in MD. The expression of gga-miR-130a in MDV-infected and uninfected spleens was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, proliferation and migration assays of MDV-transformed lymphoid cells (MSB1) were carried out by transfecting gga-miR-130a. The target genes of gga-miR-130a were predicted using TargetScan and miRDB and clustered through Gene Ontology analysis. The target genes were validated by western blot, qRT-PCR, and a dual luciferase reporter assay. Our results show that the expression of gga-miR-130a was reduced in MDV-infected spleens. Gga-miR-130a showed an inhibitory effect on MSB1 cell proliferation and migration. Two target genes, homeobox A3 (HOXA3) and MyoD family inhibitor domain containing (MDFIC), were predicted and clustered to cell proliferation. Results indicate that gga-miR-130a regulates HOXA3 and MDFIC at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. Moreover, the gga-miR-130a binding sites of two target genes have been confirmed. We conclude that gga-miR-130a can arrest MSB1 cell proliferation and migration, and target HOXA3 and MDFIC, which are both involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Collectively, gga-miR-130a plays a critical role in the tumorigenesis associated with chicken MD.((PMID:26981231))Extracellular stimuli induce gene expression responses through intracellular signaling mediators. The p38 signaling pathway is a paradigm of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that, although originally identified as stress-response mediator, contributes to establishing stem cell differentiation fates. p38α is central for induction of the differentiation fate of the skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) through not fully characterized mechanisms.To investigate the global gene transcription program regulated by p38α during satellite cell differentiation (myogenesis), and to specifically address whether this regulation occurs through direct action of p38α on gene promoters, we performed a combination of microarray gene expression and genome-wide binding analyses. For experimental robustness, two myogenic cellular systems with genetic and chemical loss of p38α function were used: (1) satellite cells derived from mice with muscle-specific deletion of p38α, and (2) the C2C12 murine myoblast cell line cultured in the absence or presence of the p38α/β inhibitor SB203580. Analyses were performed at cell proliferation and early differentiation stages.We show that p38α binds to a large set of active promoters during the transition of myoblasts from proliferation to differentiation stages. p38α-bound promoters are enriched with binding motifs for several transcription factors, with Sp1, Tcf3/E47, Lef1, FoxO4, MyoD, and NFATc standing out in all experimental conditions. p38α association with chromatin correlates very well with high levels of transcription, in agreement with its classical function as an activator of myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, p38α also associates with genes repressed at the onset of differentiation, thus highlighting the relevance of p38-dependent chromatin regulation for transcriptional activation and repression during myogenesis.These results uncover p38α association and function on chromatin at novel classes of target genes during skeletal muscle cell differentiation. This is consistent with this MAPK isoform being a transcriptional regulator.((PMID:25501595))Acute muscle injury and physiological stress from chronic muscle diseases and aging lead to impairment of skeletal muscle function. This raises the question of whether p53, a cellular stress sensor, regulates muscle tissue repair under stress conditions. By investigating muscle differentiation in the presence of genotoxic stress, we discovered that p53 binds directly to the myogenin promoter and represses transcription of myogenin, a member of the MyoD family of transcription factors that plays a critical role in driving terminal muscle differentiation. This reduction of myogenin protein is observed in G1-arrested cells and leads to decreased expression of late but not early differentiation markers. In response to acute genotoxic stress, p53-mediated repression of myogenin reduces post-mitotic nuclear abnormalities in terminally differentiated cells. This study reveals a mechanistic link previously unknown between p53 and muscle differentiation, and suggests new avenues for managing p53-mediated stress responses in chronic muscle diseases or during muscle aging.((PMID:24644423))Birth weight is an economically important trait in pig production because it directly impacts piglet growth and survival rate. In the present study, we performed a genome wide survey of candidate genes and pathways associated with individual birth weight (IBW) using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip on 24 high (HEBV) and 24 low estimated breeding value (LEBV) animals. These animals were selected from a reference population of 522 individuals produced by three sires and six dam lines, which were crossbreds with multiple breeds. After quality-control, 43,257 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), including 42,243 autosomal SNPs and 1,014 SNPs on chromosome X, were used in the data analysis. A total of 27 differentially selected regions (DSRs), including 1 on Sus scrofa chromosome 1 (SSC1), 1 on SSC4, 2 on SSC5, 4 on SSC6, 2 on SSC7, 5 on SSC8, 3 on SSC9, 1 on SSC14, 3 on SSC18, and 5 on SSCX, were identified to show the genome wide separations between the HEBV and LEBV groups for IBW in piglets. A DSR with the most number of significant SNPs (including 7 top 0.1% and 31 top 5% SNPs) was located on SSC6, while another DSR with the largest genetic differences in F ST was found on SSC18. These regions harbor known functionally important genes involved in growth and development, such as TNFRSF9 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9), CA6 (carbonic anhydrase VI) and MDFIC (MyoD family inhibitor domain containing). A DSR rich in imprinting genes appeared on SSC9, which included PEG10 (paternally expressed 10), SGCE (sarcoglycan, epsilon), PPP1R9A (protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 9A) and ASB4 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 4). More importantly, our present study provided evidence to support six quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions for pig birth weight, six QTL regions for average birth weight (ABW) and three QTL regions for litter birth weight (LBW) reported previously by other groups. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis with 183 genes harbored in these 27 DSRs suggested that protein, metal, ion and ATP binding, viral process and innate immune response present important pathways for deciphering their roles in fetal growth or development. Overall, our study provides useful information on candidate genes and pathways for regulating birth weight in piglets, thus improving our understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in porcine embryonic or fetal development.((PMID:24470334))Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are the most frequent soft tissue sarcomas in children that share many features of developing skeletal muscle. We have discovered that a T-box family member, TBX2, is highly upregulated in tumor cells of both major RMS subtypes. TBX2 is a repressor that is often overexpressed in cancer cells and is thought to function in bypassing cell growth control, including repression of p14 and p21. The cell cycle regulator p21 is required for the terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle cells and is silenced in RMS cells. We have found that TBX2 interacts with the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin and inhibits the activity of these factors. TBX2 is expressed in primary myoblasts and C2C12 cells, but is strongly downregulated upon differentiation. TBX2 recruits the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and is a potent inhibitor of the expression of muscle-specific genes and the cell cycle regulators, p21 and p14. TBX2 promotes the proliferation of RMS cells and either depletions of TBX2 or dominant negative TBX2 upregulate p21- and muscle-specific genes. Significantly, depletion or interference with TBX2 completely inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft assay, highlighting the oncogenic role of TBX2 in RMS cells. Thus, the data demonstrate that elevated expression of TBX2 contributes to the pathology of RMS cells by promoting proliferation and repressing differentiation-specific gene expression. These results show that deregulated TBX2 serves as an oncogene in RMS, suggesting that TBX2 may serve as a new diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for RMS tumors.((PMID:23770672))Ca(2+) signaling is essential for bone homeostasis and skeletal development. Here, we show that the transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) channel and the inhibitor of MyoD family, I-mfa, function antagonistically in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. I-mfa null mice have an osteopenic phenotype characterized by increased osteoclast numbers and surface, which are normalized in mice lacking both Trpc1 and I-mfa. In vitro differentiation of pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa-deficient mice leads to an increased number of mature osteoclasts and higher bone resorption per osteoclast. These parameters return to normal levels in osteoclasts derived from double mutant mice. Consistently, whole cell currents activated in response to the depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores are larger in pre-osteoclasts derived from I-mfa knock-out mice compared with currents in wild type mice and normalized in cells derived from double mutant mice, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of I-mfa on TRPC1 in these cells. A new splice variant of TRPC1 (TRPC1ε) was identified in early pre-osteoclasts. Heterologous expression of TRPC1ε in HEK293 cells revealed that it is unique among all known TRPC1 isoforms in its ability to amplify the activity of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, mediating store-operated currents. TRPC1ε physically interacts with Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel, and I-mfa is recruited to the TRPC1ε-Orai1 complex through TRPC1ε suppressing CRAC channel activity. We propose that the positive and negative modulation of the CRAC channel by TRPC1ε and I-mfa, respectively, fine-tunes the dynamic range of the CRAC channel regulating osteoclastogenesis.((PMID:23570531))PCAF (KAT2B) belongs to the GNAT family of lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) and specifically acetylates the histone H3K9 residue and several nonhistone proteins. PCAF is also a transcriptional coactivator. Due to the lack of a PCAF KAT-specific small molecule inhibitor, the exclusive role of the acetyltransferase activity of PCAF is not well understood. Here, we report that a natural compound of the hydroxybenzoquinone class, embelin, specifically inhibits H3Lys9 acetylation in mice and inhibits recombinant PCAF-mediated acetylation with near complete specificity in vitro. Furthermore, using embelin, we have identified the gene networks that are regulated by PCAF during muscle differentiation, further highlighting the broader regulatory functions of PCAF in muscle differentiation in addition to the regulation via MyoD acetylation.((PMID:23296833))Satellite cells are the resident stem cell population of adult skeletal muscle tissue that is responsible for growth and regeneration. The cells typically congregate near the tips of the muscle fibers and in close proximity to the neural muscular junction (NMJ). Ephrin-A5 is a chemotactic molecule that participates in the correct positioning and formation of the NMJ. The objective of the experiment was to examine the effects of ephrin-A5 signaling on bovine satellite cell (BSC) biology. Primary cultures of BSC demonstrate changes in velocity with time in culture that is unique to the Paired box protein 7 (Pax7):Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) subpopulation. Treatment of the BSC with ephrin-A5 causes a reduction (P < 0.05) in velocity with a concomitant increase (P < 0.05) in directed migration. The chemoattractant properties of ephrin-A5 occur before myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) expression in the myogenic precursors and are abrogated after their differentiation to committed myoblasts. Ephrin-A5 induced migration appears to require components of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling machinery. Supplementation of culture media with a chemical ROCK inhibitor suppressed (P < 0.05) ephrin-A5 initiated BSC migration. These results contrast with treatment of BSC with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a key modulator of myogenic and motogenic activity. Treatment of BSC with HGF had no effect on cell motility or migration immediately after culture establishment. Twenty-four hours after culture establishment, BSC demonstrated an increase (P < 0.05) in transwell migration toward HGF. These results document that temporal and spatial gradients of chemokines and growth factors participate in the localization of BSC within the niche.((PMID:22991226))The class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as transcriptional repressors by altering chromatin structure through histone deacetylation. This family of enzymes regulates muscle development and phenotype, through regulation of muscle-specific genes including myogenin and MyoD (MYOD1). More recently, class IIa HDACs have been implicated in regulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism. However, the effects of HDAC5 on glucose metabolism and insulin action have not been directly assessed. Knockdown of HDAC5 in human primary muscle cells increased glucose uptake and was associated with increased GLUT4 (SLC2A4) expression and promoter activity but was associated with reduced GLUT1 (SLC2A1) expression. There was no change in PGC-1α (PPARGC1A) expression. The effects of HDAC5 knockdown on glucose metabolism were not due to alterations in the initiation of differentiation, as knockdown of HDAC5 after the onset of differentiation also resulted in increased glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. These data show that inhibition of HDAC5 enhances metabolism and insulin action in muscle cells. As these processes in muscle are dysregulated in metabolic disease, HDAC inhibition could be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve muscle metabolism in these diseases. Therefore, we also examined the effects of the pan HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid, on muscle cell metabolism. In myotubes, Scriptaid increased histone 3 acetylation, GLUT4 expression, glucose uptake and both oxidative and non-oxidative metabolic flux. Together, these data suggest that HDAC5 regulates muscle glucose metabolism and insulin action and that HDAC inhibitors can be used to modulate these parameters in muscle cells.((PMID:22120524))Skeletal muscle differentiation is regulated by transcription factors, including members of the myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) family and many signaling pathways. The JAK1 and JAK2 pathways are known to each have different effects on myoblast proliferation and differentiation; however, the role of JAK3 in myoblast differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of JAK3 inhibition on myogenic differentiation in the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line. During myogenic differentiation, treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor WHIp154 significantly increased the number of MHC-positive multinucleated myotubes and the expressions of myosin heavy chain (MHC), myogenin (MGN), MyoD, and myogenic enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Knockdown of the JAK3 gene using siJAK3 also significantly increased MHC, MGN and MyoD mRNA expressions as well as insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene expression. During differentiation, JAK3 was initially activated and later decreased. Differentiation decreased STAT1, which was further decreased by WHIp154. In contrast, STAT3 gradually was elevated during differentiation, and was increased by JAK3 inhibition. Moreover, we found that up-regulation of AKT activity and down-regulation of ERK activity cooperated to accelerate myogenic differentiation. Taken together, these data indicate that JAK3 inhibition potently facilitates myoblast differentiation through antagonistic STAT1/STAT3 activities. Additionally, JAK3 inhibition induced precocious differentiation and played important roles for terminal differentiation, including fusion, which is involved with regulation of AKT and ERK pathways.((PMID:21268083))The present study evaluated endogenous activities and the role of BMP and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), representative members of the TGF-β family, during myotube differentiation in C2C12 cells. Smad phosphorylation at the C-terminal serines was monitored, since TGF-β family members signal via the phosphorylation of Smads in a ligand-dependent manner. Expression of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, which is an indicator of BMP activity, was higher before differentiation, and rapidly decreased after differentiation stimulation. Differentiation-related changes were consistent with those in the expression of Ids, well-known BMP-responsive genes. Treatment with inhibitors of BMP type I receptors or noggin in C2C12 myoblasts down-regulated the expression of myogenic regulatory factors, such as Myf5 and MyoD, leading to impaired myotube formation. Addition of BMP-2 during the myoblast phase also inhibited myotube differentiation through the down-regulation of Myf5 and MyoD. In contrast to endogenous BMP activity, the phosphorylation of Smad2, a TGF-β-responsive Smad, was higher 8-16 days after differentiation stimulation. A-83-01, an inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor, increased the expression of Myf5 and MyoD, and enhanced myotube formation. The present results reveal that endogenous activities of the TGF-β family are changed during myogenesis in a pathway-specific manner, and that the activities are required for myogenesis.((PMID:21147088))Differentiation often requires conversion of analogue signals to a stable binary output through positive feedback. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling promotes myogenesis in the vertebrate somite, in part by raising the activity of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs) of the Myod family above a threshold. Hh is known to enhance MRF expression. Here we show that Hh is also essential at a second step that increases Myod protein activity, permitting it to promote Myogenin expression. Hh acts by inducing expression of cdkn1c (p57(Kip2)) in slow muscle precursor cells, but neither Hh nor Cdkn1c is required for their cell cycle exit. Cdkn1c co-operates with Myod to drive differentiation of several early zebrafish muscle fibre types. Myod in turn up-regulates cdkn1c, thereby providing a positive feedback loop that switches myogenic cells to terminal differentiation.((PMID:20956996))Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine of the interleukin-6 family and plays important roles during inflammation. However, its roles in myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration remain unexplored. We show here that OSM potently inhibited myoblast differentiation mainly by activating the JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathway. OSM downregulated myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2A (MEF2A), upregulated the expression of Id1 and Id2, and inhibited the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MEF2. In addition, OSM also enhanced the expression of STAT3 and OSM receptor, which constituted a positive feedback loop to further amplify OSM-induced signaling. Moreover, we found that STAT1 physically associated with MEF2 and repressed its transcriptional activity, which could account for the OSM-mediated repression of MEF2. Although undetectable in normal muscles in vivo, OSM was rapidly induced on muscle injury and then promptly downregulated just before the majority of myoblasts differentiate. Prolonged expression of OSM in muscles compromised the regeneration process without affecting myoblast proliferation, suggesting that OSM functions to prevent proliferating myoblasts from premature differentiation during the early phase of muscle regeneration.((PMID:20641378))Firefly luciferase (Fluc) is an oxygenase extracted from Photinus pyralis with a molecular weight of 62 kDa (1). In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and O2, Fluc oxidizes the heterocyclic substrate d-luciferin to oxyluciferin and emits light in the wavelength range of 400–620 nm (2). The active site of Fluc comprises two distinct domains, a large N-terminal domain (residue 4–436) and a small C-terminal domain (residue 440–544), which are separated by a wide cleft (1). Splitting Fluc into N- and C-terminal fragments destroys its enzymatic activity, resulting in a complete loss of bioluminescence. The enzymatic activity or bioluminescence can be restored if the N- and C-terminal fragments are in close proximity (3). This led to the development of a novel labeling strategy for imaging protein–protein interactions in vivo, the split reporter (4). In this method, reporters like Fluc are dissected into two fragments and fused to a pair of proteins (A and B) that strongly interact with each other. The enzymatic activity of Fluc can be restored via two split reporter approaches: a complementation strategy and a reconstitution strategy. In the complementation strategy, protein A is connected with the N-terminal fragment of Fluc, and protein B is connected with the C-terminal fragment of Fluc. Interaction between protein A and B recovers the enzymatic activity of Fluc by bringing the two fragments of Fluc closely together. In the reconstitution strategy, protein A is connected with the N-terminal of one-half of a protein splicing system such as DNA polymerase III (N-intein DnaE) followed by N-terminal fragment of Fluc. Protein B is linked to the C-terminal of the other half of the splicing system (C-intein DnaE) followed by the C-terminal fragment of Fluc. The interaction between protein A and B brings the N- and C-inteins together, resulting in the joining of N- and C-terminal fragments of Fluc by a peptide bond and a release of a fully reconstituted protein Fluc. Both split enzyme approaches allow for recovery of bioluminescence. MyoD is a myogenic regulatory protein that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors (5). MyoD activates myogenesis by binding directly to the control region of muscle-specific genes, and it converts fibroblasts into skeletal muscle. The helices in MyoD bind tightly with other HLH factors such as Id to form a heterodimer. Id, also known as an inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding, lacks the basic domain for DNA binding and acts as dominant negative regulator in myogenesis or other cell proliferations (6). Id protein-firefly luciferase N-fragment & firefly luciferase C-fragment-MyoD protein (Id-NFluc & CFluc-MyoD) make up a pair of interacting proteins attached to the split Fluc fragments (7). Id-NFluc & CFluc-MyoD can be prepared with complementation strategy or reconstitution strategy, and are employed for in vivo imaging of the interaction between Id and MyoD via the produced bioluminescence.((PMID:20417616))Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV)-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein has been reported to interact with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) and to negatively regulate its activity, leading to stimulation of GSK-3beta-dependent beta-catenin degradation. We show here that the I-mfa domain proteins, HIC (human I-mfa domain-containing protein) and I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family a), interacted in vivo with LANA through their C-terminal I-mfa domains. This interaction affected the intracellular localization of HIC, inhibited the LANA-dependent transactivation of a beta-catenin-regulated reporter construct, and decreased the level of the LANA.GSK-3beta complex. These data reveal for the first time that I-mfa domain proteins interact with LANA and negatively regulate LANA-mediated activation of Wnt signaling-dependent transcription by inhibiting the formation of the LANA.GSK-3beta complex.((PMID:20235117))MyoD is a DNA-binding protein capable of specific interactions that involve the helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. The HLH motif of MyoD can form oligomers with the HLH motif of Id1 (the inhibitor of DNA-binding proteins) that folds into a highly stable helical conformation stabilized by the self-association. The Id family consists of four related proteins that contain a highly conserved dimerization motif known as the HLH domain. In signaling pathways, Id proteins act as dominant negative antagonists of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors which play important roles in cellular development, proliferation, and differentiation. The mechanism of Id proteins is to antagonize bHLH proteins by binding as dominant negative HLH proteins to form high-affinity heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, thereby preventing them from binding to DNA and inhibiting transcription of differentiation-associated genes. The goal of this study is to design and synthesize peptide fragments of MyoD with high affinity for Id1 to interrupt the interactions among Id1, MyoD, and other bHLH DNA-binding proteins and to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Affinity of each peptide for Id1 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The secondary structure of each peptide was studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Biological effects of each peptide in several cancer cells such as breast and colon cancer cells were analyzed. Results demonstrated that the peptide 3C (H-Tyr-Ile-Glu-Gly-Leu-Gln-Ala-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asp-Gln-NH(2)) not only showed high affinity for Id1 but also exhibited antiproliferative effects in HT-29 and MCF-7 cancer cells; the IC(50) value of 3C was determined as 25 microM in both cells. The percentage of sub-G1 in the cell cycle of the cancer cells treated with 5 microM of 3C was increased, indicating the induced apoptosis of cancer cells by 3C. Taken together, the peptide 3C is a promising lead compound for the development of antiproliferative agents.((PMID:19520771))Most growth factors stimulate myoblast proliferation and prevent differentiation, whereas insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) promote myoblast differentiation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs) are involved in cell growth and differentiation via activation of pro-growth factors. However, the role of SPCs in myogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we show that PACE4, a member of the SPC family, plays a critical role in myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. PACE4 mRNA levels increased markedly during myogenesis, whereas the expression of other member of SPC family, furin and PC6, remained unchanged. The expression pattern of pro-IGF-II, which is processed extracellularly by SPCs, was similar to that of PACE4. The expression of shRNA targeting PACE4, but not furin, suppressed the expression of the muscle-specific myosin light chain (MLC). Interestingly, reduced expression of MLC was restored following treatment with recombinant mature IGF-II. Finally, we demonstrated that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked the induction of PACE4 mRNA, a result not observed when another myogenic differentiation inhibitor, SB203580 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor), was employed, indicating the presence of a positive feedback loop regulating PACE4 expression. These results suggest that PACE4 plays an important role in myogenic differentiation through its association with the IGF-II pathway.((PMID:19090724))Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus is an RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm, but the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein localizes specifically in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected cells. Nuclear localization of N is non-essential for PRRSV replication in cultured cells but has been shown to modulate the pathogenesis of virus in pigs, suggesting that N plays an accessory role in the nucleus during infection. We identified by yeast two-hybrid screening the inhibitor of MyoD family-a (I-mfa) domain-containing protein (HIC) as a cellular partner for PRRS virus (PRRSV) N protein. This protein is a homolog of human HIC, a recently identified cellular transcription factor. The specific interaction of PRRSV N with HIC was confirmed in cells by mammalian two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro by GST pull-down assay. HIC is a zinc-binding protein and confocal microscopy demonstrated co-localization of N with the HIC-p40 isomer in the nucleus and nucleolus, and in the cytoplasm with HIC-p32, which is the N-terminal truncation of HIC-p40. The porcine homolog of HIC is universally expressed in pig tissues including alveolar macrophages. The interaction of viral capsid with the cellular transcription factor implicates a possible regulation of host cell gene expression by the N protein during PRRSV infection.((PMID:27693641))((PMID:26469549))The I-mfa domain proteins HIC (also known as MDFIC) and I-mfa (also known as MDFI) are candidate tumor suppressor genes that are involved in cellular and viral transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that HIC and I-mfa directly interact with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein in vitro. In addition, HIC and I-mfa repress Tax-dependent transactivation of an HTLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) reporter construct in COS-1, Jurkat and high-Tax-producing HTLV-1-infected T cells. HIC also interacts with Tax through its I-mfa domain in vivo and represses Tax-dependent transactivation of HTLV-1 LTR and NF-κB reporter constructs in an interaction-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that HIC decreases the nuclear distribution and stimulates the proteasomal degradation of Tax. These data reveal that HIC specifically interacts with HTLV-1 Tax and negatively regulates Tax transactivational activity by altering its subcellular distribution and stability.((PMID:26384474))CD180, a related member of the Toll-like receptor family, is lost or underexpressed at the plasma membrane in circulating cells of various B-cell lymphomas except marginal zone lymphomas (MZL). In order to confirm its clinical relevance in routine analysis, we evaluated prospectively the expression of CD180 in 236 patients from 5 French University Hospital laboratories on behalf of the GEIL. Highly comparable results were obtained in all centers using the EuroFlow standardization protocol. We observed that CD180 median fluorescence (MdFI) was significantly higher in MZL and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) compared to all other B-cell proliferations (P < 0.05). CD180 intensity could distinguish lymphomas with numerous villous lymphocytes from other MZL. ROC curve analysis identified a CD180 MdFI threshold for which the diagnosis of MZL could be assessed with 77% sensitivity and 92% specificity. This study showed that CD180 can be considered as a single positive robust marker of MZL and should be therefore included in flow cytometry panels for the diagnosis of mature B-cell neoplasms. Harmonization process is of great interest in order to evaluate new markers in multicentric studies and to set up decisional thresholds. © 2015 International Clinical Cytometry Society.((PMID:26183718))We determined the effect of p53 activation on de novo protein synthesis using quantitative proteomics (pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture/pSILAC) in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480. This was combined with mRNA and noncoding RNA expression analyses by next generation sequencing (RNA-, miR-Seq). Furthermore, genome-wide DNA binding of p53 was analyzed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq). Thereby, we identified differentially regulated proteins (542 up, 569 down), mRNAs (1258 up, 415 down), miRNAs (111 up, 95 down) and lncRNAs (270 up, 123 down). Changes in protein and mRNA expression levels showed a positive correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.0001). In total, we detected 133 direct p53 target genes that were differentially expressed and displayed p53 occupancy in the vicinity of their promoter. More transcriptionally induced genes displayed occupied p53 binding sites (4.3% mRNAs, 7.2% miRNAs, 6.3% lncRNAs, 5.9% proteins) than repressed genes (2.4% mRNAs, 3.2% miRNAs, 0.8% lncRNAs, 1.9% proteins), suggesting indirect mechanisms of repression. Around 50% of the down-regulated proteins displayed seed-matching sequences of p53-induced miRNAs in the corresponding 3'-UTRs. Moreover, proteins repressed by p53 significantly overlapped with those previously shown to be repressed by miR-34a. We confirmed up-regulation of the novel direct p53 target genes LINC01021, MDFI, ST14 and miR-486 and showed that ectopic LINC01021 expression inhibits proliferation in SW480 cells. Furthermore, KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT mRNAs were confirmed as direct targets of the p53-induced miR-34a, miR-205 and miR-486-5p, respectively. In line with the loss of p53 function during tumor progression, elevated expression of KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT was detected in advanced stages of cancer. In conclusion, the integration of multiple omics methods allowed the comprehensive identification of direct and indirect effectors of p53 that provide new insights and leads into the mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression.((PMID:26126114))Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease that is clinically classified into several subtypes. Among these subtypes, basal-like breast cancer largely overlaps with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and these two groups are generally studied together as a single entity. Differences in the molecular makeup of breast cancers can result in different treatment strategies and prognoses for patients with different breast cancer subtypes. Compared with other subtypes, basal-like and other ER+ breast cancer subtypes exhibit marked differences in etiologic factors, clinical characteristics and therapeutic potential. Anthracycline drugs are typically used as the first-line clinical treatment for basal-like breast cancer subtypes. However, certain patients develop drug resistance following chemotherapy, which can lead to disease relapse and death. Even among patients with basal-like breast cancer, there can be significant molecular differences, and it is difficult to identify specific drug resistance proteins in any given patient using conventional variance testing methods. Therefore, we designed a new method for identifying drug resistance genes. Subgroups, personalized biomarkers, and therapy targets were identified using cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes. We found that basal-like breast cancer could be further divided into at least four distinct subgroups, including two groups at risk for drug resistance and two groups characterized by sensitivity to pharmacotherapy. Based on functional differences among these subgroups, we identified nine biomarkers related to drug resistance: SYK, LCK, GAB2, PAWR, PPARG, MDFI, ZAP70, CIITA and ACTA1. Finally, based on the deviation scores of the examined pathways, 16 pathways were shown to exhibit varying degrees of abnormality in the various subgroups, indicating that patients with different subtypes of basal-like breast cancer can be characterized by differences in the functional status of these pathways. Therefore, these nine differentially expressed genes and their associated functional pathways should provide the basis for novel personalized clinical treatments of basal-like breast cancer.((PMID:25472652))DNA methylation is a potential tumor marker for several cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), because of its heritable and stable characteristics.Using a high-resolution, genome-wide approach, we epigenotyped >450,000 CpG sites in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 23 microsatellite instability (MSI)/microsatellite stability (MSS) CRC cases. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the methylation status of five frequently hypermethylated genes were confirmed in 75 independent CRC series and 353 CRC patients with available plasma.Compared with non-tumor tissues, 13 MSI tumors had 34,836 (7 %) aberrant methylation sites, 87 % of which were hypermethylated. In contrast, only 9,806 (2 %) differentially methylated sites were identified in ten MSS cases (62 % hypermethylated). In both MSI and MSS, 228 promoter-associated CpG islands were hypermethylated, with AGBL4, ZNF625, MDFI, TWIST1, and FLI1 being most frequently hypermethylated. In an independent set of 35 MSI and 40 MSS cases, the methylation status of these five genes significantly differed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Of 353 CRC patients, 230 (65.2 %), 232 (65.7 %), and 247 (70.0 %) had AGBL4, FLI1, and TWIST1 promoter hypermethylation in circulating cell-free DNA, respectively. In patients without metastasis, the sensitivity of any two or three hypermethylation markers was 52.8-57.8 and 27.9-38.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of any two or three markers was significantly high in patients with stage IV disease (73.0 and 55.6 %, respectively). The prognostic value of these epimarkers was inconclusive.DNA methylation patterns differed in CRC subtypes. The identified hypermethylation markers in CRC patients may have good sensitivity in different CRC stages.((PMID:22681909))The common genes responsible for the characteristics of primary cultured invasive phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were investigated. Primary cultured HCC cells from three patients were separated by Matrigel invasion into parent and invasive cells. Whole human genome oligo microarray was applied to detect the differentially expressed genes in invasive cells. A purchased HCC cell line (HA 22T/VGH) was studied for comparison. Forty genes were consistently up-regulated and 14 genes were consistently down-regulated among primary cultured invasive cells. Among these genes, only three up-regulated genes (CNN1, PLAT, SPARC) and one down-regulated tumor suppressor gene (MDFI) had same expressions in invasive cells originated from purchased cell line. For primary cultured invasive cells, differential expressions of several groups of common genes are known to have capacities to promote proliferation (CAV1, IL6, PLAT, RRAD, SRPX), remodeling of extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, NID2, TNC, RELN, SPARC), migration (ACTG2, CAV1, CCL2, CCL26, CDC42EP3, CNN1, PHLDB2, PLAT, RRAD, SRPX), implantation (IL6), immune escape (CD70) and angiogenesis (CCL2, IL6, IL18, PLAT, SLIT3). Two genes related to signal transduction (AXL, RASL10B) and one related to metabolism (PTGS2) also showed consistent expressions. Differential expressions of these genes are capable for tumor invasiveness. In conclusion, the characteristics of invasive phenotype HCC cells are originated from differential expressions of several groups of genes rather than few target genes. This information may give us a new insight to design new stratagems in HCC treatment. Analysis of the results from a purchased cell line may have bias due to long-term repeated in vitro cultures.((PMID:22194164))Many QTLs for fatness traits have been mapped on pig chromosome 7q1.1-1.4 in various pig resource populations. Eight novel markers, including seven SNPs and one insertion or deletion within BTNL1, COL21A1, PPARD, GLP1R, MDFI, GNMT, ABCC10, and PLA2G7 genes, as well as two previously reported SNPs in SLC39A7 and HMGA1 genes, were genotyped in Large White and Meishan pig breeds. Except for two SNPs in HMGA1 and ABCC10 genes, allele frequencies of the other eight markers are highly significant different between Chinese indigenous Meishan breeds and Large White pig breeds. Eight polymorphic sites were then used for linkage and QTL mapping to refine the fatness QTL in a Large White × Meishan F(2) resource population. Five chromosome-wise significant QTLs were detected, of which the QTLs for leaf fat weight, backfat thickness at 6-7th rib and rump, and mean backfat thickness were narrowed to the interval between PPARD and GLP1R genes and the QTL for backfat thickness at thorax-waist between GNMT and PLA2G7 genes on SSC7p1.1-q1.4.((PMID:22083596))Pancreatic cancer (PanC) presents at late stage with high mortality. Effective early detection methods are needed. Aberrantly methylated genes are unexplored as markers for noninvasive detection by stool testing. The authors aimed to select discriminant methylated genes and to assess accuracy of these and mutant KRAS in stool to detect PanC.Nine target genes were assayed by real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in bisulfite-treated DNA from microdissected frozen specimens of 24 PanC cases and 30 normal colon controls. Archived stools from 58 PanC cases and 65 controls matched on sex, age, and smoking were analyzed. Target genes from fecal supernatants were enriched by hybrid capture, bisulfite-treated, and assayed by MSP. KRAS mutations were assayed using the QuARTS technique.Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs) for tissue BMP3, NDRG4, EYA4, UCHL1, MDFI, Vimentin, CNTNAP2, SFRP2, and TFPI2 were 0.90, 0.79, 0.78, 0.78, 0.77, 0.77, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.66, respectively. The top 4 markers and mutant KRAS were evaluated in stool. BMP3 was the most discriminant methylation marker in stool. At 90% specificity, methylated BMP3 alone detected 51% of PanCs, mutant KRAS detected 50%, and combination detected 67%. AUCs for methylated BMP3, mutant KRAS, and combination in stool were 0.73, 0.75, and 0.85, respectively.This study demonstrates that stool assay of a methylated gene marker can detect PanC. Among candidate methylated markers discriminant in tissue, BMP3 alone performed well in stool. Combining methylated BMP3 and mutant KRAS increased stool detection over either marker alone.((PMID:21813317))In this paper, three kinds of imidazole derivatives, 2-(4-methylphenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (MDFI), 2-(4-nitrophenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (NDFI), and 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (t-BDFI) were synthesized. In an alkaline medium, the chemiluminescence (CL) reaction of imidazole derivatives with H(2)O(2) has been investigated. It was also found that MDFI/H(2)O(2) and t-BDFI/H(2)O(2) systems gave strong CL. When Co(2+) was added into the two CL systems, the CL intensity was remarkably enhanced. In the optimum conditions, the CL intensity is linearly related to the logarithm of concentration of Co(2+). The linear ranges are 5×10(-9)-2.5×10(-7) mol/L for MDFI/H(2)O(2) system and 5×10(-9)-2.5×10(-7) mol/L for t-BDFI/H(2)O(2) system, and the corresponding detection limits are 1.2×10(-9) mol/L and 1.1×10(-9) mol/L, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of Co(2+) in vitamin B(12) injection. Furthermore, the CL mechanism was also discussed.((PMID:21779381))Migraine is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both migraine and CVD are highly heritable. However, the genetic liability for CVD among migraineurs is unclear.We performed a genome-wide association study for incident CVD events during 12 years of follow-up among 5,122 migraineurs participating in the population-based Women's Genome Health Study. Migraine was self-reported and CVD events were confirmed after medical records review. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and considered a genome-wide p-value <5×10(-8) as significant.Among the 5,122 women with migraine 164 incident CVD events occurred during follow-up. No SNP was associated with major CVD, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or CVD death at the genome-wide level; however, five SNPs showed association with p<5×10(-6). Among migraineurs with aura rs7698623 in MEPE (OR = 6.37; 95% CI 3.15-12.90; p = 2.7×10(-7)) and rs4975709 in IRX4 (OR = 5.06; 95% CI 2.66-9.62; p = 7.7×10(-7)) appeared to be associated with ischemic stroke, rs2143678 located close to MDF1 with major CVD (OR = 3.05; 95% CI 1.98-4.69; p = 4.3×10(-7)), and the intergenic rs1406961 with CVD death (OR = 12.33; 95% CI 4.62-32.87; p = 5.2×10(-7)). Further, rs1047964 in BACE1 appeared to be associated with CVD death among women with any migraine (OR = 4.67; 95% CI 2.53-8.62; p = 8.0×10(-7)).Our results provide some suggestion for an association of five SNPs with CVD events among women with migraine; none of the results was genome-wide significant. Four associations appeared among migraineurs with aura, two of those with ischemic stroke. Although our population is among the largest with migraine and incident CVD information, these results must be treated with caution, given the limited number of CVD events among women with migraine and the low minor allele frequencies for three of the SNPs. Our results await independent replication and should be considered hypothesis generating for future research.((PMID:21664411))The I-mfa domain proteins I-mfa and HIC are considered to be candidate tumor suppressor genes and have been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation. We show here that I-mfa and HIC specifically interact with SEI-1 through their C-terminal I-mfa domains in vivo. This interaction affects the intracellular localization of I-mfa and requires the region of SEI-1 between 30 and 90 amino acids, which includes its SERTA domain, and results in repression of its intrinsic transcriptional activity. I-mfa also decreases the levels of the SEI-1·DP-1 complex and endogenous Fbxw7 mRNA, the expression of which is coregulated by E2F·DP-1 and SEI-1 in an interaction-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, I-mfa also specifically interacts with other SERTA domain-containing proteins, including SEI-2, SEI-3, SERTAD3 and SERTAD4, through its I-mfa domain in vivo. This interaction also affects the intracellular localization of I-mfa and represses the intrinsic transcriptional activities of SEI-2 and SERTAD3, which are also involved in the E2F-dependent transcription. These data reveal for the first time that I-mfa domain proteins interact with SERTA domain proteins and negatively regulate their transcriptional activity. Because SEI-1, SEI-2 and SERTAD3, whose intrinsic transcriptional activities are repressed by I-mfa, are suggested to be oncogenes, I-mfa domain proteins may be involved in their oncogenic functions by negatively regulating their transcriptional activities.((PMID:18791226))The auxiliary spliceosomal protein SCNM1 contributes to recognition of nonconsensus splice donor sites. SCNM1 was first identified as a modifier of the severity of a sodium channelopathy in the mouse. The most severely affected strain, C57BL/6J, carries the variant allele SCNM1R187X, which is defective in splicing the mutated donor site in the Scn8a(medJ) transcript. To further probe the in vivo function of SCNM1, we constructed a floxed allele and generated a mouse with constitutive deletion of exons 3-5. The SCNM1Delta3-5 protein is produced and correctly localized to the nucleus, but is more functionally impaired than the C57BL/6J allele. Deficiency of SCNM1 did not significantly alter other brain transcripts. We characterized an ENU-induced allele of Scnm1 and evaluated the ability of wild-type SCNM1 to rescue lethal mutations of I-mfa and Brunol4. The phenotypes of the Scnm1Delta3-5 mutant confirm the role of this splice factor in processing the Scn8a(medJ) transcript and provide a new allele of greater severity for future studies.((PMID:18535405))Many genes undergo aberrant methylation in human cancers, and microarray platforms enable more comprehensive profiling of aberrant DNA methylation patterns.1,010 of 87,922 probes on the 88 K promoter array (606 genes) had a higher signal (log(2) > 2) in the pancreatic cancer line, Panc-1 compared to the non-neoplastic pancreatic duct line, HPDE. Using this cut-off, bisulfite sequencing and/or MSP confirmed differential methylation of all 27 genes (66 probes) predicted to be methylated by the MCA array. More than 1/2 of the genes aberrantly hypermethylated in Panc-1 were not expressed in the pancreatic duct (HPDE) by expression array analysis. Using the 244 K CpG island array, 1,968 CpG islands were differentially methylated in MiaPaca2 compared to normal pancreas. The MCA method was more likely to identify hypermethylation within CpG islands than a cocktail of methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. DNA methylation profiles using 10 ng of DNA were highly correlated with those obtained using 5 ug of DNA (R2 = 0.98). Analysis of 57 pancreatic cancers and 34 normal pancreata using MSP identified MDFI, hsa-miR-9-1, ZNF415, CNTNAP2 and ELOVL4 as methylated in 96%, 89%, 86%, 82% and 68% of the cancers vs. 9%, 15%, 6%, 3% and 97% of normal pancreata, respectively.We used methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) and Agilent promoter and CpG island microarrays to identify differential DNA methylation patterns in pancreatic cancer vs. normal pancreas. We examined MCA array reproducibility, compared it to methylation profiles obtained using a cocktail of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and examined gene expression of methylated genes.Promoter and CpG island array analysis finds aberrant methylation of hundreds of promoters and CpG islands in pancreatic cancer cells.((PMID:18388480))A commercial chromogenic agar medium (DFI) was supplemented with glucose (mDFI) to enhance the specificity of Enterobacter sakazakii (E. sakazakii) detection. Escherichia vulneris (E. vulneris), a putative false-positive strain on the DFI medium, produces alpha-glucosidase. The enzyme alpha- glucosidase hydrolyzes a substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3- indolyl-alpha,D-glucopyranoside (XalphaGlc), producing green colonies. E. sakazakii strains produced green colonies on both DFI and mDFI agar, whereas E. vulneris produced green colonies on DFI agar but small white colonies on mDFI agar. E. sakazakii and E. vulneris were also readily differentiated by colony color when the mixed culture of the two strains was plated on mDFI agar and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The results indicate that the selectivity of the commercial chromogenic agar medium could be improved by a simple supplementation with glucose.((PMID:19666247))The toxic hepatitis is the most common manifestation of acute liver disease in patient with alcohol. In these patients the discriminatory function index (DFI) > 32, has been associated with a mortality rate of up to 50%. MELD is a scale that has been recently validated as independent risk factors for death in patients who are candidates for liver transplantation.To compare the usefulness in mortality score vs. MELD. Maddrey index of discrimination in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and analyze the factors in a cohort Mexican prognosis.We evaluated the usefulness of MELD, compared with the index of discrimination Maddrey so retrospective in 67 hospitalized patients with alcoholic hepatitis in the Hospital Juárez in Mexico.The c-statistic for mDFI was 0.69 (CI 0.56-0.82) and to MELD was 0.73 (CI 0.61-0.86), sensitivity and specificity of DFI > 32 in 7 days to predict mortality was 100 and 7.1% , Respectively, and to meld > 21 sensitivity was 96% and specificity of 9.5%. The presence of encephalopathy > grade 2 and creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL was independent predictors of mortality.MELD > 21 calculated on admission, is equally useful for the mDFI for predicting mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis in the first week.((PMID:18316399))Wnt regulation of muscle development is thought to be mediated by the beta-catenin-TCF/LEF-dependent canonical pathway. Here we demonstrate that beta-catenin, not TCF/LEF, is required for muscle differentiation. We showed that beta-catenin interacts directly with MyoD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor essential for muscle differentiation and enhances its binding to E box elements and transcriptional activity. MyoD-mediated transactivation is inhibited in muscle cells when beta-catenin is deficient or the interaction between MyoD and beta-catenin is disrupted. These results demonstrate that beta-catenin is necessary for MyoD function, identifying MyoD as an effector in the Wnt canonical pathway.((PMID:17891141))The bHLH transcription factor Hand1 is essential for placentation and cardiac morphogenesis in the developing embryo. Here we implicate Hand1 as a molecular switch that determines whether a trophoblast stem cell continues to proliferate or commits to differentiation. We identify a novel interaction of Hand1 with a protein that contains an I-mfa (inhibitor of myogenic factor) domain that anchors Hand1 in the nucleolus where it negatively regulates Hand1 activity. In the trophoblast stem-cell line Rcho-1, nucleolar sequestration of Hand1 accompanies sustained cell proliferation and renewal, whereas release of Hand1 into the nucleus leads to its activation, thus committing cells to a differentiated giant-cell fate. Site-specific phosphorylation is required for nucleolar release of Hand1, for its dimerization and biological function, and this is mediated by the non-canonical polo-like kinase Plk4 (Sak). Sak is co-expressed in Rcho-1 cells, localizes to the nucleolus during G2 and phosphorylates Hand1 as a requirement for trophoblast stem-cell commitment to a giant-cell fate. This study defines a novel cellular mechanism for regulating Hand1 that is a crucial step in the stem-cell differentiation pathway.((PMID:17289077))Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complexes, composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1 or T2, are engaged by many cellular transcription regulators that activate or inhibit transcription from specific promoters. The related I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family a) and HIC (human I-mfa-domain-containing) proteins function in myogenic differentiation and embryonic development by participating in the Wnt signaling pathway. We report that I-mfa is a novel regulator of P-TEFb. Both HIC and I-mfa interact through their homologous I-mfa domains with cyclin T1 and T2 at two binding sites. One site is the regulatory histidine-rich domain that interacts with CDK9 substrates including RNA polymerase II. The second site contains a lysine and arginine-rich motif that is highly conserved between the two T cyclins. This site overlaps and includes the previously identified Tat/TAR recognition motif of cyclin T1 required for activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription. HIC and I-mfa can serve as substrates for P-TEFb. Their I-mfa domains also bind the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and inhibit Tat- and P-TEFb-dependent transcription from the HIV-1 promoter. This transcriptional repression is cell-type specific and can operate via Tat and cyclin T1. Genomic and sequence comparisons indicate that the I-mf and HIC genes, as well as flanking genes, diverged from a duplicated chromosomal region. Our findings link I-mfa and HIC to viral replication, and suggest that P-TEFb is modulated in the Wnt signaling pathway.((PMID:27697847))((PMID:27664381))The aim of our study was to characterize the immediate phenotypic and adaptive regulatory responses of fetuses to different in utero conditions reflecting inadequate maternal protein supply during gestation. The gilts fed high- (250% above control) or low- (50% under control) protein diets isoenergetically adjusted at the expense of carbohydrates from the day of insemination until the fetuses were collected at day 64 or 94 of gestation. We analyzed body composition, histomorphology, biochemistry, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of fetal skeletal muscle. Both diets had only marginal effects on body composition and muscular cellularity of fetuses including an unchanged total number of myofibers. However, mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MYOG, MRF4, P ≤ 0.1), IGF system (IGF1, IGF1R, P ≤ 0.05) and myostatin antagonist FST (P = 0.6, in males only) was reduced in the fetal muscle exposed to a maternal low-protein diet. As a result of excess protein, MYOD, MYOG, IGF1R, and IGFBP5 mRNA expression (P ≤ 0.05) was upregulated in fetal muscle. Differences in muscular mRNA expression indicate in utero regulatory adaptive responses to maternal diet. Modulation of gene expression immediately contributes to the maintenance of an appropriate fetal phenotype that would be similar to that observed in the control fetuses. Moreover, we suggest that the modified gene expression in fetal skeletal muscle can be viewed as the origin of developmental muscular plasticity involved in the concept of fetal programming.((PMID:27662091))Mammalian DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression networks in many biological processes. However, investigation of the functions of specific methylation events remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that fusion of Tet1 or Dnmt3a with a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) enables targeted DNA methylation editing. Targeting of the dCas9-Tet1 or -Dnmt3a fusion protein to methylated or unmethylated promoter sequences caused activation or silencing, respectively, of an endogenous reporter. Targeted demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV or the MyoD distal enhancer by dCas9-Tet1 induced BDNF expression in post-mitotic neurons or activated MyoD facilitating reprogramming of fibroblasts into myoblasts, respectively. Targeted de novo methylation of a CTCF loop anchor site by dCas9-Dnmt3a blocked CTCF binding and interfered with DNA looping, causing altered gene expression in the neighboring loop. Finally, we show that these tools can edit DNA methylation in mice, demonstrating their wide utility for functional studies of epigenetic regulation.((PMID:27661449))PAS domain containing protein kinase (Pask) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase implicated in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation across eukaryotic species. We now describe an unexpected role of Pask in promoting the differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and adipogenic progenitor cells. This function of Pask is dependent upon its ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a member of several protein complexes including those that catalyze histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during transcriptional activation. Our findings suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, Pask stimulates the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 to activating H3K4me3 marks on the promoter of the differentiation gene myogenin (Myog) via Wdr5 phosphorylation. This enhances accessibility of the MyoD transcription factor and enables transcriptional activation of the Myog promoter to initiate muscle differentiation. Thus, as an upstream kinase of Wdr5, Pask integrates signaling cues with the transcriptional network to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells.((PMID:27661135))Muscle development, or myogenesis, is a highly regulated, complex process. A subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators of myogenesis. Recently, miR-378a was found to be involved in myogenesis, but the mechanism of how miR-378a regulates the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts has not been determined. We found that miR-378a-3p expression in muscle was significantly higher than in other tissues, suggesting an important effect on muscle development. Overexpression of miR-378a-3p increased the expression of MyoD and MHC in C2C12 myoblasts both at the level of mRNA and protein, confirming that miR-378a-3p promoted muscle cell differentiation. The forced expression of miR-378a-3p promoted apoptosis of C2C12 cells as evidenced by CCK-8 assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining results. Through TargetScan, histone acetylation enzyme 4 (HDAC4) was identified as a potential target of miR-378a-3p. We confirmed targeting of HDAC4 by miR-378a-3p using a dual luciferase assay and western blotting. Our RNAi analysis results also showed that HDAC4 significantly promoted differentiation of C2C12 cells and inhibited cell survival through Bcl-2. Therefore, we conclude that miR-378a-3p regulates skeletal muscle growth and promotes the differentiation of myoblasts through the post-transcriptional down-regulation of HDAC4.((PMID:27651888))Cellular models of muscle disease are taking on increasing importance with the large number of genes and mutations implicated in causing myopathies and the concomitant need to test personalized therapies. Developing cell models relies on having an easily obtained source of cells, and if the cells are not derived from muscle itself, a robust reprogramming process is needed. Fibroblasts are a human cell source that works well for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated into cardiomyocyte lineages, and with less efficiency, skeletal muscle-like lineages. Alternatively, direct reprogramming with the transcription factor MyoD has been used to generate myotubes from cultured human fibroblasts. Although useful, fibroblasts require a skin biopsy to obtain and this can limit their access, especially from pediatric populations.We now demonstrate that direct reprogramming of urine-derived cells is a highly efficient and reproducible process that can be used to establish human myogenic cells. We show that this method can be applied to urine cells derived from normal individuals as well as those with muscle diseases. Furthermore, we show that urine-derived cells can be edited using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.With progress in understanding the molecular etiology of human muscle diseases, having a readily available, noninvasive source of cells from which to generate muscle-like cells is highly useful.((PMID:27641238))Recent evidence suggests that autophagy and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway regulate skeletal muscle growth and bone formation in aged rats. However, the effect of downhill running on muscle growth and bone formation is not well understood. Thus, we investigated the effect of downhill and uphill running on age-related muscle and bone weakness. Young and late middle-aged rats were randomly assigned to control groups; young (YC) and late middle-aged (LMC), and two types of running training groups: late middle-aged downhill (LMD) and late middle-aged uphill (LMU). Training was progressively carried out on a treadmill at a speed of 21 m/min with a slope of +10° for uphill training vs 16 m/min with a slope of -16° for downhill training: 60 min/day, 5 days/week for 8 weeks respectively. Downhill and uphill training increased the autophagy-related proteins 5 (ATG5), microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3-Ⅱ), Beclin-1, and p62 proteins in aged rats. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SODs), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) signaling pathway were also elevated. Phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) and myogenic differentiation (MyoD) were increased significantly in LMD and LMU groups. Consequently in the femur, BMP-2, -7 and autophagy molecules were expressed highly in LMD and LMU groups. These results suggest that both of the downhill and uphill training appeared to positively affect autophagy molecules and BMPs expression, respectively. Particularly, these physiological adaptations from gradual downhill training have an effect on bone morphological changes and muscle quality similar to gradual uphill training interventions in aging.

In this study, a new cell-laden scaffold was developed that supplies micro/nano-topological cues and promotes efficient release of cells. The hierarchical structure consisted of poly(ε-caprolactone) macrosized struts for sustaining a three-dimensional structural shape, aligned nanofibers obtained with optimized electrospinning, and cell-printed myoblasts. Importantly, the printed myoblasts were fully safe and were efficiently released from the cell-laden struts to neighboring nanofiber networks. The incorporation of micro/nanofibers in the hierarchical scaffold significantly affected myoblast proliferation, alignment, and even facilitated the formation of myotubes. We observed that myosin heavy chain expression and the expression levels of various myogenic genes (MyoD, myogenin, and troponin T) were significantly affected by the fiber alignment achieved in our hierarchical cell-laden structure. We believe that the combination of cell-printing and a hierarchical scaffold that encourages fiber alignment is a highly promising technique for skeletal muscle tissue engineering.((PMID:27628322))Postnatal skeletal muscle growth results from the activation of satellite cells and/or an increase in protein synthesis. The Notch signalling pathway maintains satellite cells in a quiescent state, and once activated, sustains their proliferation and commitment towards differentiation. In mammals, POFUT1-mediated O-fucosylation regulates the interactions between NOTCH receptors and ligands of the DELTA/JAGGED family, thus initiating the activation of canonical Notch signalling. Here, we analysed the consequences of downregulated expression of the Pofut1 gene on postnatal muscle growth in mutant Pofut1(cax/cax) (cax, compact axial skeleton) mice and differentiation of their satellite cell-derived myoblasts (SCDMs). Pofut1(cax/cax) mice exhibited muscle hypertrophy, no hyperplasia and a decrease in satellite cell numbers compared with wild-type C3H mice. In agreement with these observations, Pofut1(cax/cax) SCDMs differentiated earlier concomitant with reduced Pax7 expression and decrease in PAX7(+)/MYOD(-) progenitor cells. In vitro binding assays showed a reduced interaction of DELTA-LIKE 1 ligand (DLL1) with NOTCH receptors expressed at the cell surface of SCDMs, leading to a decreased Notch signalling as seen by the quantification of cleaved NICD and Notch target genes. These results demonstrated that POFUT1-mediated O-fucosylation of NOTCH receptors regulates myogenic cell differentiation and affects postnatal muscle growth in mice.((PMID:27611768))The cdk inhibitor p57(kip2), encoded by the Cdkn1c gene, plays a critical role in mammalian development and in the differentiation of several tissues. Cdkn1c protein levels are carefully regulated via imprinting and other epigenetic mechanisms affecting both the promoter and distant regulatory elements, which restrict its expression to particular developmental phases or specific cell types. Inappropriate activation of these regulatory mechanisms leads to Cdkn1c silencing, causing growth disorders and cancer. We have previously reported that, in skeletal muscle cells, induction of Cdkn1c expression requires the binding of the bHLH myogenic factor MyoD to a long-distance regulatory element within the imprinting control region KvDMR1. Interestingly, MyoD binding to KvDMR1 is prevented in myogenic cell types refractory to the induction of Cdkn1c. In the present work, we took advantage of this model system to investigate the epigenetic determinants of the differential interaction of MyoD with KvDMR1. We show that treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine restores the binding of MyoD to KvDMR1 in cells refractory to Cdkn1c induction. This, in turn, promotes the release of a repressive chromatin loop between KvDMR1 and Cdkn1c promoter and, thus, the upregulation of the gene. Analysis of the chromatin status of Cdkn1c promoter and KvDMR1 in two cell types showed that their differential responsiveness to the MyoD-dependent induction of the gene does not involve just their methylation status but, rather, the differential H3 lysine 9 dimethylation at KvDMR1. Finally, we report that the same histone modification also marks the KvDMR1 region of human cancer cells in which Cdkn1c is silenced. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the epigenetic status of KvDMR1 represents a critical determinant of the cell type-restricted expression of Cdkn1c and, possibly, of its aberrant silencing in some pathological conditions.((PMID:27610551))The purpose of this paper was to study the effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway on reloading-mediated restoration of disuse muscle loss induced by hind limb suspension in rats.Rats were divided into 4 groups: control group (CON), HLS group (hind limb suspension for 2 weeks), HLS + R group (hind limb suspension for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of natural reloading), and HRS + E group (hind limb suspension for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of treadmill exercise). Body weight, and weight and protein concentration of gastrocnemius were determined. The expression of members of canonical and noncanonical TGFβ signaling pathways, including TGFβ1, myostatin (MSTN), phospho-smad2/3, phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38, JNK1/2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 [ERK1]/ERK2), as well as the corresponding downstream effectors of muscle mass-p21, Pax7, MyoD, and MyoG-was determined at protein or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels.Reloading increased MyoD mRNA and restored the decreased gastrocnemius weight/body weight ratio, protein concentration of gastrocnemius, phospho-ERK2, Pax7 and the increased TGFβ1, MSTN, phospho-smad2/3, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK1/2, and p21 induced by hind limb suspension. Moreover, the effects of exercise reloading on the restoration of gastrocnemius weight/body weight ratio, TGFβ1, MSTN, phospho-smad2, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK2, Pax7, as well as the induction of MyoD mRNA were stronger than those of natural reloading.Disuse muscle loss can be recovered by reloading in an intensity-dependent manner through canonical and noncanonical TGFβ signaling pathways. Pax7 and MyoD might be the effectors of TGFβ pathway in mediating the recovery effect of reloading.((PMID:27586271))Transfection with in vitro transcribed mRNAs is a safe and effective tool to convert somatic cells to any cell type of interest. One caveat of mRNA transfection is that mRNAs are recognized by multiple RNA-sensing toll like receptors (TLRs). These TLRs can both promote and inhibit cellular reprogramming. We demonstrated that mRNA transfection stimulated TLR3 and TLR7 and induced cytotoxicity and IFN-β expression in human and mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, mRNA transfection induced paracrine inhibition of repeated mRNA transfection through type I IFNs. Modified mRNAs (mmRNAs) containing pseudouridine and 5-methycytosine reduced TLR stimulation, cytotoxicity and IFN-β expression in fibroblasts. Repeated liposomal transfection with MyoD mmRNAs significantly enhanced myogenic conversion of human and mouse fibroblasts compared with repeated transfection with MyoD mRNAs. Interestingly, electroporation of mRNAs and mmRNAs completely abrogated cytotoxicity and IFN-β expression and also abolished myogenic conversion of fibroblasts. At a low concentration, TLR7/8 agonist R848 enhanced MyoD mmRNA-driven conversion of human fibroblasts into skeletal muscle cells, whereas high concentrations of R848 inhibited myogenic conversion of fibroblasts. Our study suggests that deliberate control of TLR signaling is a key factor in the success of mRNA-driven cellular reprogramming.((PMID:27583449))The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the flavonoid quercetin (3,3´,4´,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) in a mice model of intense acute swimming-induced muscle pain, which resembles delayed onset muscle soreness. Quercetin intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment dose-dependently reduced muscle mechanical hyperalgesia. Quercetin inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-β-D- glucosaminidase (NAG) activities, cytokine production, oxidative stress, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and gp91phox mRNA expression and muscle injury (creatinine kinase [CK] blood levels and myoblast determination protein [MyoD] mRNA expression) as well as inhibited NFκB activation and induced Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA expression in the soleus muscle. Beyond inhibiting those peripheral effects, quercetin also inhibited spinal cord cytokine production, oxidative stress and glial cells activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [Iba-1] mRNA expression). Concluding, the present data demonstrate that quercetin is a potential molecule for the treatment of muscle pain conditions related to unaccustomed exercise.((PMID:27573543))Muscle regeneration is a coordinated process that involves proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. Activation of MyoD is a key event in myogenic differentiation, which is regulated by p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPK). In a screen of natural compounds for the enhancement of MyoD activity, dehydrocorydaline (DHC) from the Corydalis tuber was identified. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with DHC increased the expression levels of muscle‑specific proteins, including MyoD, myogenin and myosin heavy chain. In addition, C2C12 myoblasts exhibited enhanced multinucleated myotube formation without any cytotoxicity. Treatment with DHC elevated p38 MAPK activation and the interaction of MyoD with an E protein, which is likely to result in activation of MyoD and promotion of myoblast differentiation. Furthermore, defects in differentiation‑induced p38 MAPK activation and myoblast differentiation induced by depletion of the promyogenic receptor protein Cdo in C2C12 myoblasts were restored by DHC treatment. In conclusion, these results indicated that DHC stimulates p38 MAPK activation, which can enhance heterodimerization of MyoD and E proteins, thus resulting in MyoD activation and myoblast differentiation. These findings suggested that DHC may be considered a potential therapeutic compound for the improvement of muscle stem cell regenerative capacity in injured muscle.((PMID:27570911))Skeletal muscle is capable of robust self-repair following mild trauma, yet in cases of traumatic volumetric muscle loss (VML), where more than 20% of a muscle's mass is lost, this capacity is overwhelmed. Current autogenic whole muscle transfer techniques are imperfect, which has motivated the exploration of implantable scaffolding strategies. In this study, the use of an allogeneic decellularized skeletal muscle (DSM) scaffold with and without the addition of minced muscle (MM) autograft tissue was explored as a repair strategy using a lower-limb VML injury model (n = 8/sample group). We found that the repair of VML injuries using DSM + MM scaffolds significantly increased recovery of peak contractile force (81 ± 3% of normal contralateral muscle) compared to unrepaired VML controls (62 ± 4%). Similar significant improvements were measured for restoration of muscle mass (88 ± 3%) in response to DSM + MM repair compared to unrepaired VML controls (79 ± 3%). Histological findings revealed a marked decrease in collagen dense repair tissue formation both at and away from the implant site for DSM + MM repaired muscles. The addition of MM to DSM significantly increased MyoD expression, compared to isolated DSM treatment (21-fold increase) and unrepaired VML (37-fold) controls. These findings support the further exploration of both DSM and MM as promising strategies for the repair of VML injury.((PMID:27569217))Current therapeutic options for the pediatric cancer rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have not improved significantly, especially for metastatic RMS. In the present work, we performed a deep microRNA profiling of the three major human RMS subtypes, along with cell lines and normal muscle, to identify novel molecular circuits with therapeutic potential. The signature we determined could discriminate RMS from muscle, revealing a subset of muscle-enriched microRNA (myomiR), including miR-22 which was strongly underexpressed in tumors. miR-22 was physiologically induced during normal myogenic differentiation and was transcriptionally regulated by MyoD, confirming its identity as a myomiR. Once introduced into RMS cells, miR-22 decreased cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, restoring miR-22 expression blocked tumor growth and prevented tumor dissemination in vivo. Gene expression profiling analysis of miR-22-expressing cells suggested TACC1 and RAB5B as possible direct miR-22 targets. Accordingly, loss and gain of function experiments defined the biological relevance of these genes in RMS pathogenesis. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of miR-22 to intercept and overcome the intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibition based on ERBB3 upregulation. Overall our results identified a novel miR-22 regulatory network with critical therapeutic implications in RMS.((PMID:27563828))In previous studies, we have reported that phospholipase C (PLC)-β1 plays a crucial role in myogenic differentiation and we determined the importance of its catalytic activity for the initiation of this process. Here we define the effectors that take part to its signaling pathway. We show that the Inositol Polyphosphate Multikinase (IPMK) is able to promote myogenic differentiation since its overexpression determines the up-regulation of several myogenic markers. Moreover, we demonstrate that IPMK activates the same cyclin D3 promoter region targeted by PLC-β1 and that IPMK-induced promoter activation relies upon c-jun binding to the promoter, as we have shown previously for PLC-β1. Furthermore, our data shows that IPMK overexpression causes an increase in β-catenin translocation and accumulation to the nuclei of differentiating myoblasts resulting in higher MyoD activation. Finally, we describe that PLC-β1 overexpression determines too an increase in β-catenin translocation and that PLC-β1, IPMK and β-catenin are mediators of the same signaling pathway since their overexpression results in cyclin D3 and myosin heavy chain (MYH) induction.((PMID:27556060))Pompe disease (PD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency. Progressive muscular weakness is the major symptom of PD, and enzyme replacement therapy can improve the clinical outcome. However, to achieve a better clinical outcome, alternative therapeutic strategies are being investigated, including gene therapy and pharmacological chaperones. We previously used lentiviral vector-mediated GAA gene transfer in PD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. Some therapeutic efficacy was observed, although glycogen accumulation was not normalized. Transcription factor EB is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy that has recently been associated with muscular pathology, and is now a potential therapeutic target in PD model mice. Here, we differentiated skeletal muscle from PD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells by forced MyoD expression. Lentiviral vector-mediated GAA and transcription factor EB gene transfer independently improved GAA enzyme activity and reduced glycogen content in skeletal muscle derived from PD-induced pluripotent stem cells. Interestingly, GAA and transcription factor EB cooperatively improved skeletal muscle pathology, both biochemically and morphologically. Thus, our findings show that abnormal lysosomal biogenesis is associated with the muscular pathology of PD, and transcription factor EB gene transfer is effective as an add-on strategy to GAA gene transfer.((PMID:27551368))Master transcription factor MyoD can initiate the entire myogenic gene expression program which differentiates proliferating myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. We previously demonstrated that histone methyltransferase KMT1A associates with and inhibits MyoD in proliferating myoblasts, and must be removed to allow differentiation to proceed. It is known that pro-myogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and p38α MAPK play critical roles in enforcing associations between MyoD and transcriptional activators, while removing repressors. However, the mechanism which displaces KMT1A from MyoD, and the signals responsible, remain unknown.To investigate the role of p38α on MyoD-mediated differentiation, we utilized C2C12 myoblast cells as an in vitro model. p38α activity was either augmented via overexpression of a constitutively active upstream kinase or blocked via lentiviral delivery of a specific p38α shRNA or treatment with p38α/β inhibitor SB203580. Overexpression of KMT1A in these cells via lentiviral delivery was also used as a system wherein terminal differentiation is impeded by high levels of KMT1A.The association of KMT1A and MyoD persisted, and differentiation was blocked in C2C12 myoblasts specifically after pharmacologic or genetic blockade of p38α. Conversely, forced activation of p38α was sufficient to activate MyoD and overcome the differentiation blockade in KMT1A-overexpressing C2C12 cells. Consistent with this finding, KMT1A phosphorylation during C2C12 differentiation correlated strongly with the activation of p38α. This phosphorylation was prevented by the inhibition of p38α. Biochemical studies further revealed that KMT1A can be a direct substrate for p38α. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies show that the removal of KMT1A-mediated transcription repressive histone tri-methylation (H3K9me3) from the promoter of the Myogenin gene, a critical regulator of muscle differentiation, is dependent on p38α activity in C2C12 cells. Elevated p38α activity was also sufficient to remove this repressive H3K9me3 mark. Moreover, ChIP studies from C2C12 cells show that p38α activity is necessary and sufficient to establish active H3K9 acetylation on the Myogenin promoter.Activation of p38α displaces KMT1A from MyoD to initiate myogenic gene expression upon induction of myoblasts differentiation.((PMID:12514181))Helix-loop-helix (HLH) and helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (HLHZip) are dimerization domains that mediate selective pairing among members of a large transcription factor family involved in cell fate determination. To investigate the molecular rules underlying recognition specificity and to isolate molecules interfering with cell proliferation and differentiation control, we assembled two molecular repertoires obtained by directed randomization of the binding surface in these two domains. For this strategy we selected the Heb HLH and Max Zip regions as molecular scaffolds for the randomization process and displayed the two resulting molecular repertoires on lambda phage capsids. By affinity selection, many domains were isolated that bound to the proteins Mad, Rox, MyoD, and Id2 with different levels of affinity. Although several residues along an extended surface within each domain appeared to contribute to dimerization, some key residues critically involved in molecular recognition could be identified. Furthermore, a number of charged residues appeared to act as switch points facilitating partner exchange. By successfully selecting ligands for four of four HLH or HLHZip proteins, we have shown that the repertoires assembled are rather general and possibly contain elements that bind with sufficient affinity to any natural HLH or HLHZip molecule. Thus they represent a valuable source of ligands that could be used as reagents for molecular dissection of functional regulatory pathways.((PMID:27406318))Satellite cells are adult stem cells located between the basal lamina and sarcolemma of muscle fibers. Under physiological conditions, satellite cells are quiescent, but they maintain a strong proliferative potential and propensity to differentiate, which underlies their critical role in muscle preservation and growth. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles during animal development as well as in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation regulation. MiRNA-1, miRNA-133a and miRNA-206 are closely related muscle-specific miRNAs, and are thus defined myomiRNAs. MyomiRNAs are integrated into myogenic regulatory networks. Their expression is under the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of myogenic factors and, in turn, they exhibit widespread control of muscle gene expression. Very little information is available about the regulation and behavior of satellite cells in large farm animals, in particular during satellite cell differentiation. Here, we study bovine satellite cells (BoSCs) undergoing a differentiation process and report the expression pattern of selected genes and miRNAs involved. Muscle samples of longissimus thoracis from Holstein adult male animals were selected for the collection of satellite cells. All satellite cell preparations demonstrated myotube differentiation. To characterize the dynamics of several transcription factors expressed in BoSCs, we performed real-time PCR on complementary DNA generated from the total RNA extracted from BoSCs cultivated in growth medium (GM) or in differentiation medium (DM) for 4 days. In the GM condition, BoSCs expressed the satellite cell lineage markers as well as transcripts for the myogenic regulatory factors. At the time of isolation from muscle, PAX7 was expressed in nearly 100% of BoSCs; however, its messenger RNA (mRNA) levels dramatically decreased between 3 and 6 days post isolation (P<0.01). MyoD mRNA levels increased during the 1st day of cultivation in DM (day 7; P<0.02), showing a gradual activation of the myogenic gene program. During the subsequent 4 days of culture in DM, several tested genes, including MRF4, MYOG, MEF2C, TMEM8C, DES and MYH1, showed increased expression (P<0.05), and these levels remained high throughout the culture period investigated. Meanwhile, the expression of genes involved in the differentiation process also miRNA-1, miRNA-133a and miRNA-206 were strongly up-regulated on the 1st day in DM (day 7; P<0.05). Analysis revealed highly significant correlations between myomiRNAs expression and MEF2C, MRF4, TMEM8C, DES and MYH1 gene expression (P<0.001). Knowledge about the transcriptional changes correlating with the growth and differentiation of skeletal muscle fibers could be helpful for developing strategies to improve production performance in livestock.((PMID:27239431))We previously showed that Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) expression was induced when quiescent muscle satellite cells were stimulated by hepatocyte growth factor and became activated satellite cells (ASCs). However, how Sema3A regulates genes in the early phase of ASCs remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether Sema3A signaling can regulate the early phase of ASCs, an important satellite cell stage for postnatal growth, repair, and maintenance of skeletal muscle. We showed that expression of the myogenic proliferation regulatory factors Pax7 and Myf5 was decreased in myoblasts transfected with Sema3A siRNA. These cells failed to activate expression MyoD, another myogenic proliferation regulatory factor, during differentiation. Interestingly, some of the Sema3A-depleted cells did not express Pax7 and MyoD and had enlarged nuclei and very large cytoplasmic areas. We also observed that Pax7 and Myf5 expression was increased in Myc-Sema3A overexpressing myoblasts. BrdU analysis indicated that Sema3A regulated proliferation of ASCs. These findings suggest that Sema3A signaling can modulate expression of Pax7, Myf5, and MyoD. Moreover, we found that expression of emerin, an inner nuclear membrane protein, was regulated by Sema3A signaling. Emerin was identified by positional cloning as the gene responsible for the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (X-EDMD). In conclusion, our results support a role for Sema3A in maintaining ASCs through regulation, via emerin, of Pax7, Myf5, and MyoD expression.((PMID:27104590))The Peg3 (Paternally Expressed Gene 3) imprinted domain is predicted to be regulated through a large number of evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) that are localized within its middle 200-kb region. In the current study, we characterized these potential cis-regulatory regions using phylogenetic and epigenetic approaches. According to the results, the majority of these ECRs are potential enhancers for the transcription of the Peg3 domain. Also, these potential enhancers can be divided into two groups based on their histone modification and DNA methylation patterns: ubiquitous and tissue-specific enhancers. Phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses further revealed that several cis-regulatory motifs are frequently associated with the ECRs, such as the E box, PITX2, NF-κB and RFX1 motifs. A series of subsequent ChIP experiments demonstrated that the trans factor MYOD indeed binds to the E box of several ECRs, further suggesting that MYOD may play significant roles in the transcriptional control of the Peg3 domain. Overall, the current study identifies, for the first time, a set of cis-regulatory motifs and corresponding trans factors that may be critical for the transcriptional regulation of the Peg3 domain.((PMID:26854366))MicroRNAs are a class of 18-22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by associating with the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs. A large number of microRNAs are involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation, many of which remain undiscovered. In this study, we found that miR-143-3p was upregulated during C2C12 myoblast differentiation and over-expression of miR-143-3p significantly inhibited the relative expression levels of MyoD, MyoG, myf5, and MyHC genes, especially in the later stages of differentiation. In addition, miR-143-3p inhibited expression of genes involved in the endogenous Wnt signaling pathway during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, including Wnt5a, LRP5, Axin2, and β-catenin. These results indicate that miR-143-3p represents a new myogenic differentiation-associated microRNA that can inhibit C2C12 myoblast differentiation, especially in the later stages of differentiation.((PMID:26733463))Lethal fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) describes a clinically and genetically heterogeneous phenotype that includes fetal akinesia, intrauterine growth retardation, arthrogryposis and developmental anomalies. Affected babies die as a result of pulmonary hypoplasia. We aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of this disorder in a family in which there were three affected individuals from two sibships.Autosomal-recessive inheritance was suggested by a family history of consanguinity and by recurrence of the phenotype between the two sibships. We performed exome sequencing of the affected individuals and their unaffected mother, followed by autozygosity mapping and variant filtering to identify the causative gene.Five autozygous regions were identified, spanning 31.7 Mb of genomic sequence and including 211 genes. Using standard variant filtering criteria, we excluded all variants as being the likely pathogenic cause, apart from a single novel nonsense mutation, c.188C>A p.(Ser63*) (NM_002478.4), in MYOD1. This gene encodes an extensively studied transcription factor involved in muscle development, which has nonetheless not hitherto been associated with a hereditary human disease phenotype.We provide the first description of a human phenotype that appears to result from MYOD1 mutation. The presentation with FADS is consistent with a large body of data demonstrating that in the mouse, MyoD is a major controller of precursor cell commitment to the myogenic differentiation programme.((PMID:26501226))Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (ScRMS) and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (SRMS) have been recently reclassified as a stand-alone pathologic entity, separate from embryonal RMS. Genetically, a subset of the congenital cases display NCOA2 gene rearrangements, whereas tumors occurring in older children or adults harbor MYOD1 gene mutations with or without coexisting PIK3CA mutations. Despite these recent advances, a significant number of tumors lack known genetic alterations. In this study we sought to investigate a large group of pediatric SRMS/ScRMS, spanning a diverse clinical and pathologic spectrum, by using a combined fluorescence in situ hybridization, targeted DNA, and whole-transcriptome sequencing methodology for a more definitive molecular classification. A total of 26 SRMS and ScRMS cases were selected from the 2 participating institutions for the molecular analysis. Ten of the 11 congenital/infantile SRMS showed recurrent fusion genes: with novel VGLL2 rearrangements seen in 7 (63%), including VGLL2-CITED2 fusion in 4 and VGLL2-NCOA2 in 2 cases. Three (27%) cases harbored the previously described NCOA2 gene fusions, including TEAD1-NCOA2 in 2 and SRF-NCOA2 in 1. All fusion-positive congenital/infantile SRMS patients with available long-term follow-up were alive and well, none developing distant metastases. Among the remaining 15 SRMS patients older than 1 year, 10 (67%) showed MYOD1 L122R mutations, most of them following a fatal outcome despite an aggressive multimodality treatment. All 4 cases harboring coexisting MYOD1/PIK3CA mutations shared sclerosing morphology. All 5 fusion/mutation-negative SRMS cases presented as intra-abdominal or paratesticular lesions.((PMID:26387956))In polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, large polyQ repeats cause juvenile cases with different symptoms than those of adult-onset patients, who carry smaller expanded polyQ repeats. The mechanisms behind the differential pathology mediated by different polyQ repeat lengths remain unknown. By studying knockin mouse models of spinal cerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17), we found that a large polyQ (105 glutamines) in the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) preferentially causes muscle degeneration and reduces the expression of muscle-specific genes. Direct expression of TBP with different polyQ repeats in mouse muscle revealed that muscle degeneration is mediated only by the large polyQ repeats. Different polyQ repeats differentially alter TBP's interaction with neuronal and muscle-specific transcription factors. As a result, the large polyQ repeat decreases the association of MyoD with TBP and DNA promoters. Our findings suggest that specific alterations in protein interactions by large polyQ repeats may account for the unique pathology in juvenile polyQ diseases.((PMID:26029693))Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) possess unlimited proliferative potential while maintaining the ability to differentiate into any cell type including skeletal muscle cells (SMCs). hPSCs are amenable to genetic editing and can be derived from patient somatic cells, and thus represent a promising option for cell therapies for the treatment of degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophies. There are unresolved challenges however associated with the derivation and scale-up of hPSCs and generation of differentiated cells in large quantity and high purity. Reported myogenic differentiation protocols are long, require cell sorting and/or rely on ectopic expression of myogenic master regulators. More recent advances have been made with the application of small molecules to enhance the myogenic differentiation efficiency and the identification of more selective markers for the enrichment of myogenic progenitors with enhanced regenerative potential. Here we review the field of myogenic differentiation and highlight areas requiring further research.((PMID:25988569))Electrically conductive materials provide a suitable platform for the in vitro study of excitable cells, such as skeletal muscle cells, due to their inherent conductivity and electroactivity. Here it is demonstrated that bioinspired electroconductive nanopatterned substrates enhance myogenic differentiation and maturation. The topographical cues from the highly aligned collagen bundles that form the extracellular matrix of skeletal muscle tissue are mimicked using nanopatterns created with capillary force lithography. Electron beam deposition is then utilized to conformally coat nanopatterned substrates with a thin layer of either gold or titanium to create electroconductive substrates with well-defined, large-area nanotopographical features. C2C12 cells, a myoblast cell line, are cultured for 7 d on substrates and the effects of topography and electrical conductivity on cellular morphology and myogenic differentiation are assessed. It is found that biomimetic nanotopography enhances the formation of aligned myotubes and the addition of an electroconductive coating promotes myogenic differentiation and maturation, as indicated by the upregulation of myogenic regulatory factors Myf5, MyoD, and myogenin (MyoG). These results suggest the suitability of electroconductive nanopatterned substrates as a biomimetic platform for the in vitro engineering of skeletal muscle tissue.((PMID:25800978))There is increasing evidence that WT1 protein expression is found not only at nuclear, but also at cytoplasmic, level in several developing and neoplastic tissues. In order to better understand the possible role of WT1 protein in human skeletal myogenesis and oncogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma, we assessed immunohistochemically its comparative expression in a large series of human developing, adult and neoplastic skeletal muscle tissues. The present study shows that WT1 protein is developmentally expressed in the cytoplasm of human myoblasts from the 6 weeks of gestational age. This expression was maintained in the myotubes of developing muscles of the trunk, head, neck, and extremities, while it was down-regulated in fetal skeletal fibers from 20 weeks of gestational age as well as in adult normal skeletal muscle. Notably, WT1 immunostaining disappeared from rhabdomyomas, whereas it was strongly and diffusely re-expressed in all cases (27/27) of embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The comparative evaluation of the immunohistochemical findings revealed that WT1 cytoplasmic expression in rhabdomyosarcoma may represent an ontogenetic reversal, and this nuclear transcription factor can also be considered an oncofetal protein which can be exploitable as an additional, highly sensitive immunomarker, together with desmin, myogenin and MyoD1, of this tumor. Moreover, our observations support the rationale for the use of WT1 protein-based target therapy in high risk rhabdomyosarcomas in children and adolescents.((PMID:25489948))Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), one of the seven mammalian sirtuins, is a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase known to control key metabolic pathways. SIRT3 deacetylases and activates a large number of mitochondrial enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, in ATP production, and in both the citric acid and urea cycles. We have previously shown that the regulation of myoblast differentiation is tightly linked to mitochondrial activity. Since SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial activity, we decide to address its role during myoblast differentiation. For this purpose, we first investigated the expression of endogenous SIRT3 during C2C12 myoblast differentiation. We further studied the impact of SIRT3 silencing on both the myogenic potential and the mitochondrial activity of C2C12 cells. We showed that SIRT3 protein expression peaked at the onset of myoblast differentiation. The inhibition of SIRT3 expression mediated by the stable integration of SIRT3 short inhibitory RNA (SIRT3shRNA) in C2C12 myoblasts, resulted in: 1) abrogation of terminal differentiation - as evidenced by a marked decrease in the myoblast fusion index and a significant reduction of Myogenin, MyoD, Sirtuin 1 and Troponin T protein expression - restored upon MyoD overexpression; 2) a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and citrate synthase protein expression reflecting an alteration of mitochondrial density; and 3) an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mirrored by the decreased activity of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Altogether our data demonstrate that SIRT3 mainly regulates myoblast differentiation via its influence on mitochondrial activity.((PMID:25480916))Muscle satellite cells are indispensable for muscle regeneration, but the functional diversity of their daughter cells is unknown. Here, we show that many Pax7(+)MyoD(-) cells locate both beneath and outside the basal lamina during myofiber maturation. A large majority of these Pax7(+)MyoD(-) cells are not self-renewed satellite cells, but have different potentials for both proliferation and differentiation from Pax7(+)MyoD(+) myoblasts (classical daughter cells), and are specifically marked by expression of the doublecortin (Dcx) gene. Transplantation and lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that Dcx-expressing cells originate from quiescent satellite cells and that the microenvironment induces Dcx in myoblasts. Expression of Dcx seems to be necessary for myofiber maturation because Dcx-deficient mice exhibited impaired myofiber maturation resulting from a decrease in the number of myonuclei. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that one function of Dcx in myogenic cells is acceleration of cell motility. These results indicate that Dcx is a new marker for the Pax7(+)MyoD(-) subpopulation, which contributes to myofiber maturation during muscle regeneration.((PMID:25377122))Success of meat production and selection for improvement of meat quality is among the primary aims in animal production. Meat quality traits are economically important in swine; however, the underlying genetic nature is very complex. Therefore, an improved pork production strongly depends on identifying and studying how genetic variations contribute to modulate gene expression. Promoters are key regions in gene modulation as they harbour several binding motifs to transcription regulatory factors. Therefore, polymorphisms in these regions are likely to deeply affect RNA levels and consequently protein synthesis. In this study, we report the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter regions of candidate genes involved in development, cellular differentiation and muscle growth in Sus scrofa. We identified SNPs in the promoter regions of genes belonging to the Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRF) gene family (the Myogenic Differentiation gene, MYOD1) and to Growth and Differentiation Factors (GDF) gene family (Myostatin gene, MSTN, GDF8), in Casertana and Large White breeds. The purpose of this study was to investigate if polymorphisms in the promoters could affect the transcriptional activity of these genes. With this aim, we evaluated in vitro the functional activity of the luciferase reporter gene luc2 activity, driven by two constructs carrying different promoter haplotypes.We tested the effects of the G302A (U12574) transition on the promoter efficiency in MYOD1 gene. We ascertained a difference in transcription efficiency for the two variants. A stronger activity of the A-carrying construct is more evident in C2C12. The luciferase expression driven by the MYOD1-A allelic variant displayed a 3.8-fold increased transcriptional activity. We investigated the activity of two haplotype variants (AY527152) in the promoter of GDF8 gene. The haploptype-1 (A435-A447-A879) up-regulated the expression of the reporter gene by a two-fold increase, and hence presumably of the GDF8 gene, in both CHO and C2C12 cultured cells.In vitro the MYOD1-A allelic variant could up-regulate the expression of MYOD1 gene. Additionally, we could assess a different response of in vitro gene expression according to cell type used to transfect constructs, suggesting that MyoD activation is regulated by mechanisms that are specific of myoblasts.((PMID:25364710))Adult skeletal muscle possesses extraordinary regeneration capacities. After muscle injury or exercise, large numbers of newly formed muscle fibers are generated within a week as a result of expansion and differentiation of a self-renewing pool of muscle stem cells termed muscle satellite cells. Normally, satellite cells are mitotically quiescent and reside beneath the basal lamina of muscle fibers. Upon regeneration, satellite cells are activated, and give rise to daughter myogenic precursor cells. After several rounds of proliferation, these myogenic precursor cells contribute to the formation of new muscle fibers. During cell division, a minor population of myogenic precursor cells returns to quiescent satellite cells as a self-renewal process. Currently, accumulating evidence has revealed the essential roles of satellite cells in muscle regeneration and the regulatory mechanisms, while it still remains to be elucidated how satellite cell self-renewal is molecularly regulated and how satellite cells are important in aging and diseased muscle. The number of satellite cells is decreased due to the changing niche during ageing, resulting in attenuation of muscle regeneration capacity. Additionally, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, the loss of satellite cell regenerative capacity and decreased satellite cell number due to continuous needs for satellite cells lead to progressive muscle weakness with chronic degeneration. Thus, it is necessary to replenish muscle satellite cells continuously. This review outlines recent findings regarding satellite cell heterogeneity, asymmetric division and molecular mechanisms in satellite cell self-renewal which is crucial for maintenance of satellite cells as a muscle stem cell pool throughout life. In addition, we discuss roles in the stem cell niche for satellite cell maintenance, as well as related cell therapies for approaching treatment of DMD.((PMID:24972797))In vertebrates, muscles of the pectoral girdle connect the forelimbs with the thorax. During development, the myogenic precursor cells migrate from the somites into the limb buds. Whereas most of the myogenic precursors remain in the limb bud to form the forelimb muscles, several cells migrate back toward the trunk to give rise to the superficial pectoral girdle muscles, such as the large pectoral muscle, the latissimus dorsi and the deltoid. Recently, this developing mode has been referred to as the "In-Out" mechanism. The present study focuses on the mechanisms of the "In-Out" migration during formation of the pectoral girdle muscles. Combining in ovo electroporation, tissue slice-cultures and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we visualize live in detail the retrograde migration of myogenic precursors from the forelimb bud into the trunk region by live imaging. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence for the involvement of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1 during these processes. After microsurgical implantations of CXCR4 inhibitor beads in the proximal forelimb region of chicken embryos, we demonstrate with the aid of in situ hybridization and live-cell imaging that CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling is crucial for the retrograde migration of pectoral girdle muscle precursors. Moreover, we analyzed the MyoD expression in CXCR4-mutant mouse embryos and observed a considerable decrease in pectoral girdle musculature. We thus demonstrate the importance of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis for the pectoral girdle muscle formation in avians and mammals.((PMID:24963862))Muscular dystrophies comprise a large group of inherited disorders that lead to progressive muscle wasting. We wanted to investigate if targeting satellite cells can enhance muscle regeneration and thus increase muscle mass. We treated mice with hepatocyte growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor under three conditions: normoxia, hypoxia and during myostatin deficiency. We found that hepatocyte growth factor treatment led to activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K protein synthesis pathway, up-regulation of the myognic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin, and subsequently the negative growth control factor, myostatin and atrophy markers MAFbx and MuRF1. Hypoxia-induced atrophy was partially restored by hepatocyte growth factor combined with leukemia inhibitory factor treatment. Dividing satellite cells were three-fold increased in the treatment group compared to control. Finally, we demonstrated that myostatin regulates satellite cell activation and myogenesis in vivo following treatment, consistent with previous findings in vitro. Our results suggest, not only a novel in vivo pharmacological treatment directed specifically at activating the satellite cells, but also a myostatin dependent mechanism that may contribute to the progressive muscle wasting seen in severely affected patients with muscular dystrophy and significant on-going regeneration. This treatment could potentially be applied to many conditions that feature muscle wasting to increase muscle bulk and strength.((PMID:24949706))As the understanding of the nutritional regulation of muscle growth mechanisms in fish is fragmentary, the present study aimed to (1) characterise ontogenetic changes in muscle growth-related genes in parallel to changes in muscle cellularity; (2) determine whether an early decrease in dietary protein:energy ratio by fat addition affects the muscle growth mechanisms of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) alevins; and (3) determine whether this early feeding of a high-fat (HF) diet to alevins had a long-term effect on muscle growth processes in juveniles fed a commercial diet. Developmental regulation of hyperplasia and hypertrophy was evidenced at the molecular (expression of myogenic regulatory factors, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and myosin heavy chains (MHC)) and cellular (number and diameter of white muscle fibres) levels. An early decrease in dietary protein:energy ratio by fat addition stimulated the body growth of alevins but led to a fatty phenotype, with accumulation of lipids in the anterior part, and less caudal muscle when compared at similar body weights, due to a decrease in both the white muscle hyperplasia and maximum hypertrophy of white muscle fibres. These HF diet-induced cellular changes were preceded by a very rapid down-regulation of the expression of fast-MHC. The present study also demonstrated that early dietary composition had a long-term effect on the subsequent muscle growth processes of juveniles fed a commercial diet for 3 months. When compared at similar body weights, initially HF diet-fed juveniles indeed had a lower mean diameter of white muscle fibres, a smaller number of large white muscle fibres, and lower expression levels of MyoD1 and myogenin. These findings demonstrated the strong effect of early feed composition on the muscle growth mechanisms of trout alevins and juveniles.((PMID:24462753))TCAP (also known as titin-cap or telethonin) is one of the titin interacting Z-disk proteins involved in the regulation and development of normal sarcomeric structure. In this study, we cloned the cDNA and promoter sequences of porcine TCAP gene, which contained a 504 bp full-length coding region. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that porcine TCAP was highly expressed in the skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney. During postnatal muscle development, TCAP expression was down-regulated from 30 days to 120 days in Large White and Meishan pigs. One single nucleotide polymorphism c.334 G>A in exon 2 of the TCAP gene was identified and detected by allele-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR). Association analysis revealed that the polymorphism had significant associations (P<0.05 and P<0.01) with some carcass traits. Analysis of the porcine TCAP promoter in different cell lines demonstrated that it is a muscle-specific promoter. In addition, we found that the porcine TCAP promoter can be activated by MyoD, MyoG and MEF2 in myotubes, which indicated that TCAP may play a role in the regulation of porcine skeletal muscle development. These findings provide useful information for the further investigation of the function of TCAP in porcine skeletal muscle.((PMID:22733692))Treadmill running is a commonly used training method for patients with spasticity to improve functional performance. Botulinum toxin has been widely used therapeutically to reduce contraction force of spastic muscle. However, the effects of treadmill running in neuromuscular junction expression and motor unit physiology on muscle following botulinum toxin injection are not well established. To assess the effects of treadmill running on neuromuscular recovery of gastrocnemius following botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection, we observed changes in gene expression. We hypothesized that the expression of acetylcholine receptor (AChR), myogenesis, and nerve plasticity could be enhanced. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats received botulinum toxin injection in right gastrocnemius and were then randomly assigned into untrained control and treadmill running groups. The rats assigned to the treadmill running group were trained on a treadmill 3 times/week with a running speed of 15 m/min for 8 weeks. The duration of training was 20 min per session. Muscle strength and gene expression of AChR subunit (α, β, δ, γ, and ε), MyoD, Myf-5, MRF4, myogenin, p21, IGF-1, GAP43, were analyzed. Treadmill running had no influence on gastrocnemius mass, but improved the maximal contraction force of the gastrocnemius in the treadmill running group (p < 0.05). Upregulation of GAP-43, IGF-1, Myo-D, Myf-5, myogenin, and AChR subunits α and β were found following treadmill running. The expression of genes associated with neurite and AChR regeneration following treadmill exercise was upregulated, which may have contributed to enhanced recovery of gastrocnemius strength.((PMID:15497153))The primary aim of our study was to determine whether the esophageal innervation (i.e., vagal and enteric) and the skeletal muscle-secreted neurotrophins have a role in smooth-to-skeletal muscle transdifferentiation and in the muscarinic-to-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor type transition. To that end, we used genetically engineered embryos and immunohistochemistry. We found that, in the absence of Myf5 and MyoD, the esophageal muscle cells failed to develop the striated phenotype of acetylcholine receptors. In addition, the development of vagal and enteric innervation was delayed in Myf5(-/-):MyoD(-/-) and NT-3(-/-) mutants, but it was reestablished 2 days before the end of gestation. The smooth muscle cells in the esophagus appeared to be a distinct subpopulation of cells and their ability to transdifferentiate was based on their competence to express neurotrophins and their receptors. Finally, our data suggest a role for NT-3 in the esophageal muscle transdifferentiation.((PMID:8309537))Previous studies had shown that MyoD promoted nicotinic acetylcholine subunit gene expression; the present experiments were done to determine whether this subsequently led to the development of functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Transfection of C3H 10T1/2 cells with MyoD cDNA resulted in the appearance of [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites; radiolabelled alpha-toxin binding was not observed in cells transfected with a plasmid that lacked MyoD cDNA. Receptor development plateaued over a time course of several days with maximal binding seven and 11 days after exposure to fusion medium. [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding was of high affinity (Kd = 1 nM), saturable and was inhibited by nicotinic but not muscarinic receptor ligands, with IC50s of 1-3 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin, 1-3 microM for d-tubocurarine and 3-10 microM for nicotine. Not only did the cells exhibit a cell surface nicotinic receptor but they also expressed a nicotinic receptor mediated functional response. Carbachol resulted in uptake of 22Na into the cells at concentrations similar to those required for receptor activation at a muscle type nicotinic receptor; furthermore, the functional response was effectively blocked by nicotinic receptor ligands, including alpha-bungarotoxin (IC50 = 2 to 6 nM) and d-tubocurarine (IC50 = 0.1 to 0.4 microM); muscarinic receptor ligands had no effect. A time course study showed that alpha-bungarotoxin binding and carbachol stimulated 22Na uptake developed in parallel, suggesting that the observed functional response was mediated through an interaction at the alpha-bungarotoxin recognition site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)((PMID:22460713))The chemokine-like receptor-1 (CMKLR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by chemerin, a secreted plasma leukocyte attractant and adipokine. Previous studies identified that CMKLR1 is expressed in skeletal muscle in a stage-specific fashion during embryogenesis and in adult mice; however, its function in skeletal muscle remains unclear. Based on the established function of CMKLR1 in cell migration and differentiation, we investigated the hypothesis that CMKLR1 regulates the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. In C(2)C(12) mouse myoblasts, CMKLR1 expression increased threefold with differentiation into multinucleated myotubes. Decreasing CMKLR1 expression by adenoviral-delivered small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) impaired the differentiation of C(2)C(12) myoblasts into mature myotubes and reduced the mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors myogenin and MyoD while increasing Myf5 and Mrf4. At embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), CMKLR1 knockout (CMKLR1(-/-)) mice appeared developmentally delayed and displayed significantly lower wet weights and a considerably diminished myotomal component of somites as revealed by immunolocalization of myosin heavy chain protein compared with wild-type (CMKLR1(+/+)) mouse embryos. These changes were associated with increased Myf5 and decreased MyoD protein expression in the somites of E12.5 CMKLR1(-/-) mouse embryos. Adult male CMKLR1(-/-) mice had significantly reduced bone-free lean mass and weighed less than the CMKLR1(+/+) mice. We conclude that CMKLR1 is essential for myogenic differentiation of C(2)C(12) cells in vitro, and the CMKLR1 null mice have a subtle skeletal muscle deficit beginning from embryonic life that persists during postnatal life.((PMID:21585421))1. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to have an important role during muscle regeneration. The regenerative capacity of muscles after contusion injury in LIF-knockout mice is impaired compared with that of wild-type mice. 2. To clarify whether LIF modulates muscle regeneration by regulating myogenic precursor cell activity, we studied LIF expression and myogenic precursor cell activity in gastrocnemius muscles from Wistar rats at various times after contusion injury using immunohistochemistry and the direct effect of LIF on a rat myoblast cell line (L6). 3. After contusion injury, transient upregulation of the mRNA expression of LIF, LIF receptors and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, downstream of LIF and involved in enhanced cell proliferation, was observed. A marked increase in LIF protein in the cytosol of damaged myofibres was strongly correlated with a significant increase in the number of myogenic precursor cells (MyoD-positive cells) by 12 h after contusion. In addition, coexpression of LIF and MyoD protein in control and injured muscles after contusion injury from 3 h to 7 days was evident. 4. Treatment of L6 cells with LIF (1 ng/mL) in serum-free medium enhanced proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) by 24 h. This was accompanied by increased expression of c-Myc protein within 12 h and was abolished by short interference RNA against c-Myc mRNA. 5. Together, the results of the present study suggest that LIF acts via paracrine and autocrine actions to regulate myogenic precursor cell activity during muscle regeneration after contusion injury and that the proliferative effect of LIF on L6 cells occurs via c-Myc signalling.((PMID:20506232))Reduced muscle mass and increased susceptibility to TNF-induced degradation accompany inflamed ageing and chronic diseases. Furthermore, C(2) myoblasts display diminished differentiation and increased susceptibility to TNF-alpha-induced cell death versus subcloned C(2)C(12) cells, providing relevant models to assess: differentiation (creatine kinase), growth (protein), death (trypan-blue) and anabolic/catabolic parameters (RT-PCR) over 72 h +/- TNF-alpha (20 ng ml(-1)). At 48 and 72 h, respectively, larger myotubes and significantly higher CK activity (320.26 +/- 6.82 vs. 30.71 +/- 2.5, P < 0.05; 544.94 +/- 27.7 vs. 39.4 +/- 3.37 mU mg ml(-1), P < 0.05), fold increases in myoD (21.45 +/- 3.12 vs. 3.97 +/- 1.76, P < 0.05; 31.07 +/- 3.1 vs. 6.82 +/- 1.93, P < 0.05) and myogenin mRNA (241.8 +/- 40 vs. 36.80 +/- 19.3, P < 0.05; 440 +/- 100.5 vs. 201.1 +/- 86, P < 0.05) were detected in C(2)C(12) versus C(2). C(2)C(12) showed significant increases in IGF-I mRNA (243.05 +/- 3.87 vs. 105.75 +/- 21.95, P < 0.05), reduced proliferation and significantly lower protein expression (1.21 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.29 mg ml(-1), P < 0.05) at 72 h versus C(2) cells. Significant temporal reductions in C(2)C(12) IGFBP2 mRNA (28.02 +/- 15.44, 13.82 +/- 8.07, 6.92 +/- 4.37, P < 0.05) contrasted increases in C(2)s (4.31 +/- 3.31, 13.02 +/- 9.92, 82.9 +/- 58.9, P < 0.05) at 0, 48 and 72 h, respectively. TNF-alpha increased cell death in C(2)s (2.67 +/- 1.54%, 34.42 +/- 5.39%, 29.71 +/- 5.79% (0, 48, 72 h), P < 0.05), yet was without effect in C(2)C(12)s at 48 h but caused a small significant increase at 72 h (9.88 +/- 4.02% (TNF-alpha) vs. 6.17 +/- 0.749% (DM), 72 h). TNF-alpha and TNFRI mRNA were unchanged; however, larger reductions in IGF-I (8.2- and 7.5-fold vs. 4.5- and 4.1-fold (48, 72 h)), IGF-IR (2-fold vs. no-significant reduction (72 h)) and IGFBP5 (3.24 vs. 1.38 (48 h) and 2.21 vs. 1.71 (72 h), P < 0.05) mRNA were observed in C(2) versus C(2)C(12) with TNF-alpha. This investigation provides insight into regulators of altered basal hypertrophy and TNF-induced atrophy, providing a model for future investigation into therapeutic initiatives for ageing/wasting disorders.((PMID:18397613))Contrary to general expectation, in humans, we have recently shown that after complete conus cauda lesion, the lower motoneuron denervated myofibers may survive several years. In adult rats, the sciatectomized muscle progresses in 4-6 months from severe atrophy to a dystrophic stage and undergoes a dramatic weight loss; during this process, myofiber death/regeneration processes maintain a decreasing population of very small, but vital myofibers. At the same time, in vitro electrophysiologic recordings show that denervated fibers can maintain membrane excitability longer than they can retain contractile properties. A certain level of myofiber regeneration seems to have a role in the process, with the early re-expression of embryonic subunits of integrins and acetylcholine receptor subunits. In the present work, using the reliable real-time quantitative PCR, we confirm the long-lasting occurrence of myoblast proliferation-dependent events and their focal nature. In fact, we show here that in sciatectomized muscle, the expression of 12 selected genes was differentially regulated after 3 and 9 month denervation. At both time points, indexes of muscle activity/inactivity and tissue remodeling (proteolysis, energy usage and angiogenic factors) were down-regulated, while indexes of regenerative myogenesis (Myogenin, MyoD, MRF4 and MHCemb) were up-regulated. Immunohistochemistry with anti-MHCemb and anti-NCAM monoclonal antibodies show that such regeneration events were focally distributed. We conclude that myofiber regeneration is a non-compensatory mechanism, which prolongs the chance of reinnervation during long-lasting denervation. It may also contribute to muscle recovery in paraplegic patients, even when rehabilitation strategies based on functional electric stimulation start late after spinal cord injury (SCI).((PMID:17855775))Xin is a muscle-specific actin binding protein of which its role and regulation within skeletal muscle is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that Xin mRNA is robustly upregulated (>16-fold) within 12 h of skeletal muscle injury and is localized to the muscle satellite cell population. RT-PCR confirmed the expression pattern of Xin during regeneration, as well as within primary muscle myoblast cultures, but not other known stem cell populations. Immunohistochemical staining of single myofibers demonstrate Xin expression colocalized with the satellite cell marker Syndecan-4 further supporting the mRNA expression of Xin in satellite cells. In situ hybridization of regenerating muscle 5-7 days postinjury illustrates Xin expression within newly regenerated myofibers. Promoter-reporter assays demonstrate that known myogenic transcription factors [myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), myogenic differentiation-1 (MyoD), and myogenic factor-5 (Myf-5)] transactivate Xin promoter constructs supporting the muscle-specific expression of Xin. To determine the role of Xin within muscle precursor cells, proliferation, migration, and differentiation analysis using Xin, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were undertaken in C2C12 myoblasts. Reducing endogenous Xin expression resulted in a 26% increase (P < 0.05) in cell proliferation and a 20% increase (P < 0.05) in myoblast migratory capacity. Skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain protein levels were increased (P < 0.05) with Xin shRNA administration; however, this was not accompanied by changes in myoglobin protein (another marker of differentiation) nor overt morphological differences relative to differentiating control cells. Taken together, the present findings support the hypothesis that Xin is expressed within muscle satellite cells during skeletal muscle regeneration and is involved in the regulation of myoblast function.((PMID:11254504))The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) 2 belongs to a family of plasma membrane transporters involved in intracellular pH and cell volume regulation. We recently reported cloning of human NHE2 (hNHE2) from a colonic cDNA library. Northern blot analysis has identified NHE2 mRNA only in small intestine, prostate, kidney, colon, and skeletal muscle. In this study, we describe the structure and 5'-regulatory region of the hNHE2 gene. The hNHE2 gene spans >90 kb and is organized in 12 exons intervened by 11 introns. All introns contain the conserved GT and AG dinucleotides at the donor and acceptor sites, respectively. The hNHE2 gene was mapped to chromosome 2q11.2. Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcription initiation site in human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Analysis of the DNA nucleotide sequences of a 1.4-kb fragment of the 5'-flanking region shows no canonical TATA or CAAT boxes. However, the promoter region contains several potential cis-regulatory elements such as Sp1, early growth response-1, activator protein-2, MyoD, p300, nuclear factor-kappaB, myeloid zinc finger protein-1, caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) gene A, and Cdx protein-2 binding sites. In transient transfection studies, a reporter construct containing the 1.4-kb promoter region exhibited low luciferase activity levels. However, after deletion upstream of -664, its activity increased approximately threefold. Thus our data suggest that an inhibitory element may exist in the NHE2 promoter 5'-upstream region.((PMID:22859371))Brown fat or brown adipose tissue (BAT), found in newborn mammals as small depots localized in the interscapular region, plays a prominent role in regulating thermogenesis perinatally. The physiological importance of functional BAT has been recently reasserted in human adults. Because myoblasts and adipoblasts emerge from a common mesodermal precursor, we investigated developmental determination and the reciprocal relationship between muscle and adipocyte commitment. Here we show that a mutant mouse defective for both Igf2 and Myod genes exhibits massive BAT hypertrophy compared with wild-type and single-mutant newborns. The increased adipocyte proliferation in BAT of double-mutant newborns was associated with overexpression of the brown fat-specific marker Ucp1. More strikingly, expression of the master key gene Prdm16 involved in the switch between myogenic and brown adipogenic lineages was drastically enhanced. We further demonstrate that concomitant Myod and Igf2 inactivation accelerates differentiation of a brown preadipocyte cell line and induces lipid accumulation and increased Ucp1 and Prdm16 expression. This in vitro approach brings additional support for the implication of both Myod and Igf2 in BAT development. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that a myogenic regulator together with a growth factor act simultaneously but through independent pathways to repress Prdm16, which opens potential therapeutic perspectives for human metabolic disorders.((PMID:20053730))Gene promoters are enriched in guanine clusters that potentially fold into quadruplex structures. Such quadruplexes were implicated in the regulation of gene expression, plausibly by interacting with transcription factors. We showed previously that homodimers of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD bound in vitro most tightly bimolecular quadruplexes of promoter sequences of muscle-specific genes. By contrast, MyoD-E47 heterodimers formed tighter complexes with d(CANNTG) E-box motifs that govern muscle gene expression. Here, we show that DNA quadruplexes enhance in vivo MyoD and E-box-driven expression of a firefly luciferase (FL) reporter gene. HEK293 cells were transfected with FL expressing p4RTK-FL vector alone or together with MyoD expressing pEMSV-MyoD plasmid, with quadruplexes of alpha7 integrin or sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK) muscle gene promoters or with a combination thereof. Whereas MyoD elevated by approximately 10-fold the levels of FL mRNA and protein, the DNA quadruplexes by themselves did not affect FL expression. However, together with MyoD, quadruplex DNA increased by approximately 35-fold the amounts of FL mRNA and protein. Without affecting its expression, DNA quadruplexes bound MyoD in the cells. Based on these results, we propose models for the regulation of muscle gene transcription by direct interaction of MyoD with promoter quadruplex structures.((PMID:18511462))Four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs); MyoD, Myf-5, MRF4 and Myogenin direct muscle tissue differentiation. Heterodimers of MRFs with E-proteins activate muscle-specific gene expression by binding to E-box motifs d(CANNTG) in their promoters or enhancers. We showed previously that in contrast to the favored binding of E-box by MyoD-E47 heterodimers, homodimeric MyoD associated preferentially with quadruplex structures of regulatory sequences of muscle-specific genes. To inquire whether other MRFs shared the DNA binding preferences of MyoD, the DNA affinities of hetero- and homo-dimeric MyoD, MRF4 and Myogenin were compared. Similarly to MyoD, heterodimers with E47 of MRF4 or Myogenin bound E-box more tightly than quadruplex DNA. However, unlike homodimeric MyoD or MRF4, Myogenin homodimers associated weakly and nonpreferentially with quadruplex DNA. By reciprocally switching basic regions between MyoD and Myogenin we demonstrated dominance of MyoD in determining the quadruplex DNA-binding affinity. Thus, Myogenin with an implanted MyoD basic region bound quadruplex DNA nearly as tightly as MyoD. However, a grafted Myogenin basic region did not diminish the high affinity of homodimeric MyoD for quadruplex DNA. We speculate that the dissimilar interaction of MyoD and Myogenin with tetrahelical domains in muscle gene promoters may differently regulate their myogenic activities.((PMID:17942416))Muscle differentiation and expression of muscle-specific proteins are initiated by the binding of heterodimers of the transcription factor MyoD with E2A proteins to E-box motif d(CANNTG) in promoters or enhancers of muscle-specific genes. MyoD homodimers, however, form tighter complexes with tetraplex structures of guanine-rich regulatory sequences of some muscle genes. In this work, we identified elements in MyoD that bind E-box or tetraplex structures of promoter sequences of the muscle-specific genes alpha7 integrin and sarcomeric Mitochondrial Creatine Kinase (sMtCK). Deletions of large domains of the 315 amino acids long recombinant MyoD indicated that the binding site for both E-box and tetraplex DNA is its basic region KRKTTNADRRKAATMRERRR that encompasses the three underlined clusters of basic residues designated R(1), R(2) and R(3). Deletion of a single or pairs of R triads or R111C substitution completely abolished the E-box-binding capacity of MyoD. By contrast, the MyoD deletion mutants Delta102-114, DeltaR(3), DeltaR(1)R(3) or DeltaR(2)R(3) maintained comparable tetraplex DNA-binding capacity as reflected by the similar dissociation constants of their protein-DNA complexes. Only deletion of all three basic clusters abolished the binding of tetraplex DNA. Implications of the binding of E-box and tetraplex DNA by non-identical MyoD elements are considered.((PMID:17553906))Muscle formation and vascular assembly during embryonic development are usually considered separately. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the vasculature and muscles during limb bud development. We show that endothelial cells are detected in limb regions before muscle cells and can organize themselves in space in the absence of muscles. In chick limbs, endothelial cells are detected in the future zones of muscle cleavage, delineating the cleavage pattern of muscle masses. We therefore perturbed vascular assembly in chick limbs by overexpressing VEGFA and demonstrated that ectopic blood vessels inhibit muscle formation, while promoting connective tissue. Conversely, local inhibition of vessel formation using a soluble form of VEGFR1 leads to muscle fusion. The endogenous location of endothelial cells in the future muscle cleavage zones and the inverse correlation between blood vessels and muscle suggests that vessels are involved in the muscle splitting process. We also identify the secreted factor PDGFB (expressed in endothelial cells) as a putative molecular candidate mediating the muscle-inhibiting and connective tissue-promoting functions of blood vessels. Finally, we propose that PDGFB promotes the production of extracellular matrix and attracts connective tissue cells to the future splitting site, allowing separation of the muscle masses during the splitting process.((PMID:15923190))Myogenic transcription is activated by the binding of heterodimers of the basic helix-loop-helix proteins MyoD and E12 or E47 to a consensus E-box sequence, d(CANNTG), in promoter or enhancer regions of muscle-specific genes. Homodimers of MyoD bind E-box less tightly and are less efficient activators of transcription. Recent results from our laboratory (Yafe, A., Etzioni, S., Weisman-Shomer, P., and Fry, M. (2005) Nucleic Acids Res. 33, 2887-2900) indicate that regulatory sequences of several muscle-specific genes contain a disproportionate high content of guanine clusters that readily form hairpin and parallel-stranded unimolecular and bimolecular tetraplex structures. Here we have shown that homodimers of full-length recombinant MyoD formed complexes with bimolecular tetraplex structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences but not with their double-stranded, hairpin, or unimolecular tetraplex forms. Preferential binding of homodimeric MyoD to bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures over E-box DNA was reflected by the 18.7-39.9-fold lower dissociation constants, Kd, of the MyoD-tetraplex DNA complexes. Conversely, MyoD-E47 heterodimers formed tighter complexes with E-box as indicated by their 6.8-19.0-fold lower Kd relative to complexes with bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures. Similarly, homodimers of the 60-amino acid basic helix-loop-helix domain of MyoD bound E-box more efficiently and tetraplex DNA less efficiently than homodimers of full-length MyoD. It might be that the favored binding of MyoD homodimers to tetraplex DNA structures lowers their ability to activate muscle-specific gene transcription, whereas the formation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers and their preferential binding to E-box DNA enhance transcription.((PMID:15908587))Clustered guanine residues in DNA readily generate hairpin or a variety of tetrahelical structures. The myogenic determination protein MyoD was reported to bind to a tetrahelical structure of guanine-rich enhancer sequence of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) more tightly than to its target E-box motif [K. Walsh and A. Gualberto (1992) J. Biol. Chem., 267, 13714-13718], suggesting that tetraplex structures of regulatory sequences of muscle-specific genes could contribute to transcriptional regulation. In the current study we show that promoter or enhancer sequences of various muscle-specific genes display a disproportionately high incidence of guanine clusters. The sequences derived from the guanine-rich promoter or enhancer regions of three muscle-specific genes, human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK), mouse MCK and alpha7 integrin formed diverse secondary structures. The sMtCK sequence folded into a hairpin structure; the alpha7 integrin oligonucleotide generated a unimolecular tetraplex; and sequences from all three genes associated to generate bimolecular tetraplexes. Furthermore, two neighboring non-contiguous guanine-rich tracts in the alpha7 integrin promoter region also paired to form a tetraplex structure. We also show that homodimeric MyoD bound bimolecular tetraplex structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences more efficiently than its target E-box motif. These results are consistent with a role of tetrahelical structures of DNA in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression.((PMID:14724123))Forced expression of the bHLH myogenic factors, Myf5 and MyoD, in various mammalian cell lines induces the full program of myogenic differentiation. However, this property has not been extensively explored in vivo. We have taken advantage of the chick model to investigate the effect of electroporation of the mouse Myf5 and MyoD genes in the embryonic neural tube. We found that misexpression of either mouse Myf5 or MyoD in the chick neural tube leads to ectopic skeletal muscle differentiation, assayed by the expression of the myosin heavy chains in the neural tube and neural crest derivatives. We also showed that the endogenous neuronal differentiation program is inhibited under the influence of either ectopic mouse Myf5 or MyoD. We used this new system to analyse, in vivo, the transcriptional regulation between the myogenic factors. We found that MyoD and Myogenin expression can be activated by ectopic mouse Myf5 or MyoD, while Myf5 expression cannot be activated either by mouse MyoD or by itself. We also analysed the transcriptional regulation between the myogenic factors and the different genes involved in myogenesis, such as Mef2c, Pax3, Paraxis, Six1, Mox1, Mox2 and FgfR4. We established the existence of an unexpected regulatory loop between MyoD and FgfR4. The consequences for myogenesis are discussed.((PMID:27480135))Despite a demonstrated role for TNF-α in promoting muscle wasting and cachexia, the associated molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of myoblast differentiation dysregulated by TNF-α remain poorly understood. This study presents well-controlled proteomic profiling as a means to investigate the mechanisms of TNF-α-regulated myogenic differentiation. Primary human muscle precursor cells (MPCs) cultured in growth medium (GM), differentiation medium (DM) to induce myogenic differentiation, and DM with 20 ng/mL of TNF-α (n = 5/group) were comparatively analyzed by an ion current-based quantitative platform consisting of reproducible sample preparation/on-pellet digestion, a long-column nano-LC separation, and ion current-based differential analysis. The inhibition of myogenic differentiation by TNF-α was confirmed by reduced formation of multinucleated myotubes and the recovered expression of altered myogenic proteins such as MYOD and myogenin during myogenic differentiation. Functional analysis and validation by immunoassay analysis suggested that the cooperation of NF-κB and STAT proteins is responsible for dysregulated differentiation in MPCs by TNF-α treatment. Increased MHC class I components such as HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and beta-2-microglobulin were also observed in cultures in DM treated with TNF-α. Interestingly, inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway during myogenic differentiation induced by serum starvation was not recovered by TNF-α treatment, which combined with previous reports, implies that this process may be an early event of myogenesis. This finding could lay the foundation for the potential use of statins in modulating myogenesis through cholesterol, for example, in stem cell-based myocardial infarction treatment, where differentiation of myoblasts and stem cells into force-generating mature muscle cells is a key step to the therapeutic capacity. In conclusion, the landscapes of altered transcription regulators, metabolic processes, and signaling pathways in MPCs are revealed in the regulation of myogenic differentiation by TNF-α, which is valuable for myogenic cellular therapeutics.((PMID:22921450))Skeletal myogenesis comprises myoblast replication and differentiation into striated multinucleated myotubes. Agents that interfere with myoblast replication are important tools for the understanding of myogenesis. Recently, we showed that cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) enhances the differentiation step in chick-cultured myogenic cells, involving the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the effects of cholesterol depletion on myoblast replication have not been carefully studied. Here we show that MCD treatment increases cell proliferation in primary chick myogenic cell cultures. Treatment of myogenic cells with the anti-mitotic reagent cytosine arabinoside, immediately following cholesterol depletion, blocks the MCD-induced effects on proliferation. Cholesterol depletion induced an increase in the number of desmin-positive mononucleated cells, and an increase in desmin expression. MCD induces an increase in the expression of the cell cycle regulator p53 and the master switch gene MyoD1. Treatment with BIO, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β, induced effects similar to MCD on cell proliferation; while treatment with Dkk1, a specific inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, neutralized the effects of MCD. These findings indicate that rapid changes in the cholesterol content in cell membranes of myoblasts can induce cell proliferation, possibly by the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.((PMID:22531117))Positive feedback is a common mechanism enabling biological systems to respond to stimuli in a switch-like manner. Such systems are often characterized by the requisite formation of a heterodimer where only one of the pair is subject to feedback. This ASymmetric Self-UpREgulation (ASSURE) motif is central to many biological systems, including cholesterol homeostasis (LXRα/RXRα), adipocyte differentiation (PPARγ/RXRα), development and differentiation (RAR/RXR), myogenesis (MyoD/E12) and cellular antiviral defense (IRF3/IRF7). To understand why this motif is so prevalent, we examined its properties in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory network in yeast (Oaf1p/Pip2p). We demonstrate that the asymmetry in positive feedback confers a competitive advantage and allows the system to robustly increase its responsiveness while precisely tuning the response to a consistent level in the presence of varying stimuli. This study reveals evolutionary advantages for the ASSURE motif, and mechanisms for control, that are relevant to pharmacologic intervention and synthetic biology applications.((PMID:18572367))Classic studies of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury have been performed using young healthy mice. However, patients with peripheral vascular disease are older and often exhibit metabolic derangements that may delay healing after revascularization. Mice with genetic deletion of apolipoprotein E (ApoE(-/-)) have been used as a model in various experimental scenarios of hypercholesterolemia. These experiments evaluated the inflammatory response and changes in skeletal muscle morphology during the acute and chronic phases of limb ischemia-reperfusion injury in aged ApoE(-/-) mice.Age-matched ApoE(-/-) and wild-type (Wt) mice underwent 1.5 hours of unilateral hind limb ischemia, followed by 1, 7, or 14 days of reperfusion (DR). Histologic analysis of skeletal muscle fiber injury was assessed at 1DR. Morphologic evidence of muscular fiber maturation was assessed at 14DR. Levels of MyoD and myogenin, markers of skeletal muscle differentiation, were assessed at 7 and 14DR using Western blots. Markers of inflammation, including myeloperoxidase, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and osteopontin, were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) using Western blots at 1, 7, and 14DR. After 1DR, tissue adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels were measured to assess metabolic activity. Unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparisons.Histologic evaluation of skeletal muscle after 1DR showed no difference in the degree of injury between Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice. However, at 14DR, ApoE(-/-) mice had higher percentage of immature muscle fibers than Wt mice. Myogenin level was lower in the ApoE(-/-) mice at 7DR. Injured skeletal muscle of ApoE(-/-) mice had lower levels of myeloperoxidase than Wt mice at 7 DR and higher levels of MCP-1 at 14DR. There was no difference in the levels of tissue ATP, MIP-2, osteopontin, or CCR2 at all experimental intervals.Although there was no difference between the injured muscle of Wt and ApoE(-/-) mice during the acute phase of reperfusion, ApoE(-/-) mice showed delay in skeletal muscle healing during the chronic phase of reperfusion. This lag in muscle regeneration was associated with lower levels of myogenin at 7DR and an increased level of MCP-1 at 14DR in the ApoE(-/-) mice. The delay in skeletal muscle healing in the ApoE(-/-) mice may have broader implications for poor tissue healing and functional recovery in elderly patients who have vascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.((PMID:15522925))Previous studies of Delta 4-androstene-3,17-dione (4-androstenedione) administration in men have not demonstrated sustained increments in testosterone levels, fat-free mass (FFM), and muscle strength, and failure to demonstrate androstenedione's androgenic/anabolic effects has stifled efforts to regulate its sales. To determine whether 4-androstenedione has androgenic/anabolic properties, we evaluated its association with androgen receptor (AR) and its effects on myogenesis in vitro. Additionally, we studied the effects of a high dose of 4-androstenedione on testosterone levels, FFM, and muscle strength in hypogonadal men. We determined the dissociation constant (K(d)) for 4-androstenedione using fluorescence anisotropy measurement of competitive displacement of fluorescent androgen from AR ligand-binding domain. AR nuclear translocation and myogenic activity of androstenedione were evaluated in mesenchymal, pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells, in which androgens stimulate myogenesis through an AR pathway. We determined effects of a high dose of androstenedione (500 mg thrice daily) given for 12 wk on FFM, muscle strength, and hormone levels in nine healthy, hypogonadal men. 4-Androstenedione competitively displaced fluorescent androgen from AR ligand-binding domain with a lower affinity than dihydrotestosterone (K(d), 648 +/- 21 and 10 +/- 0.4 nm, respectively). In C3H10T1/2 cells, 4-androstenedione caused nuclear translocation of AR and stimulated myogenesis, as indicated by a dose-dependent increase in myosin heavy chain II+ myotube area and up-regulation of MyoD protein. Stimulatory effects of 4-androstenedione on myosin heavy chain II+ myotubes and myogenic determination factor expression were attenuated by bicalutamide, an AR antagonist. Administration of 1500 mg 4-androstenedione daily to hypogonadal men significantly increased serum androstenedione, total and free testosterone, estradiol, and estrone levels and suppressed SHBG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. 4-androstenedione administration was associated with significant gains in FFM (+1.7 +/- 0.5 kg; P = 0.012) and muscle strength in bench press (+4.3 +/- 3.1 kg; P = 0.006) and leg press exercises (+18.8 +/- 17.3 kg; P = 0.045). 4-androstenedione is an androgen that binds AR, induces AR nuclear translocation, and promotes myogenesis in vitro, with substantially lower potency than dihydrotestosterone. 4-androstenedione administration in high doses to hypogonadal men increases testosterone levels, FFM, and muscle strength, although at the dose tested, the anabolic effects in hypogonadal men are likely because of its conversion to testosterone.((PMID:23602632))Dioxins (e.g. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; TCDD) cause cleft palate at a high rate. A post-fusional split may contribute to the pathogenesis, and tissue fragility may be a concern. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of TCDD on the palatal epithelium, bone and muscle, which contribute to tissue integrity. ICR mice (10-12 weeks old) were used. TCDD was administered on E12.5 at 40 mg/kg. Immunohistochemical staining for AhR, ER-α, laminin, collagen IV, osteopontin, Runx2, MyoD, and desmin were performed. Furthermore, western blot analysis for osteopontin, Runx2, MyoD, and desmin were performed to evaluate protein expression in the palatal tissue. Immunohistologically, there was little difference in the collagen IV and laminin localization in the palatal epithelium between control versus TCDD-treated mice. Runx2 and osteopontin immunoreactivity decreased in the TCDD-treated palatal bone, and MyoD and desmin decreased in the TCDD-treated palatal muscle. AhR and ER-α immunoreactivity were localized to the normal palatal bone, but ER-α was diminished in the TCDD-treated palate. On western blot analysis, Runx2, MyoD, and desmin were all downregulated in the TCDD-treated palate. TCDD may suppress palatal osteogenesis and myogenesis via AhR, and cause cleft palates via a post-fusional split mechanism, in addition to a failure of palatal fusion.((PMID:9733792))Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) nuclear translocator (Arnt) gene has been isolated and characterized from a mouse genomic DNA library. The gene is about 60 kilobases long and split into 22 exons. An unusual exon/intron junctional sequence was found in the 11th intron of the gene that begins with GC at its 5'-end. The exon/intron arrangement of mArnt gene differs greatly from those of the other members of the same basic-helix-loop-helix/PAS family. The gene is TATA-less and has several transcription start sites. The promoter region of the mArnt gene is GC-rich and contains a number of putative regulatory DNA sequences such as two GC-boxes, a cAMP-responsive element, E-box, AP-1 site, and CAAT-box. Deletion experiments revealed that all these DNA elements made substantial contributions to a high level of expression of the gene, except for the cAMP-responsive element. Of all, two GC-boxes displayed the most dominant enhancing effects. It was demonstrated that there exist specific factors binding to these DNA elements in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. Among them, Sp1 and Sp3, and CAAT-box binding factor-A were identified to bind the GC-boxes and CAAT-box, respectively. Expression of MyoD in HeLa cells stimulated the Arnt promoter activity by binding to the E-box.((PMID:8287061))The AH-receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates a number of biological responses to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. Interest in this receptor is related to its role in the toxic action of a variety of environmental chemicals, the simplicity and elegance of the murine genetics that led to its characterization and the distinctive mechanism by which this receptor activates gene expression. Recent cloning experiments have demonstrated that the AH-receptor is structurally related to the Per, ARNT and Sim proteins. Members of this newly described gene family are characterized by two N-terminal domains, the most characteristic of which is a motif referred to as a PAS domain. In the AH-receptor, this domain harbours sequences involved in the formation of a hydrophobic pocket that bind receptor agonists. Adjacent to the PAS domain in the AH-receptor, ARNT and Sim proteins is a basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that appears to mediate heterodimerization and sequence specific DNA binding properties. The observation that the bHLH domain is present in the AH-receptor and the ARNT protein, a factor required for proper AH-receptor function, suggests that these proteins are heterodimeric partners that activate gene expression in a manner similar to Myc/Max and MyoD/E2A. The objectives of this review are to describe recent experimental results in this field and to use this information to develop a molecular model of AH-receptor mediated signal transduction.((PMID:1325649))A cDNA encoding the murine Ah receptor (Ahb-1 allele for aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness) has been isolated and characterized. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence revealed a region with similarity to the basic region/helix-loop-helix (BR/HLH) motif found in many transcription factors that undergo dimerization for function. In addition to the BR/HLH domain, the N-terminal domain of the Ah receptor has extensive sequence similarity to the human ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) protein and two regulatory proteins of Drosophila, Sim and Per. Photoaffinity labeling and peptide mapping studies indicate that the Ah receptor binds agonist at a domain that lies within this conserved N-terminal domain. The Ah receptor appears to be a ligand-activated transcription factor with a helix-loop-helix motif similar to those found in a variety of DNA-binding proteins, including Myc and MyoD.((PMID:10544245))The protein chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a major regulator of different transcription factors such as MyoD, a basic helix loop helix (bHLH) protein, and the bHLH-Per-aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT)-Sim (PAS) factors Sim and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), involved in the response to hypoxia, also belongs to the bHLH-PAS family. This work was aimed to investigate the putative role of Hsp90 in HIF-1 activation by hypoxia. Using a EGFP-HIF-1alpha fusion protein, co-immunoprecipitation experiments evidenced that the chimeric protein expressed in COS-7 cells interacts with Hsp90 in normoxia but not in hypoxia. We also demonstrated that Hsp90 interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of HIF-1alpha. Moreover, Hsp90 is not co-translocated with HIF-1alpha into the nucleus. At last, we showed that Hsp90 activity is essential for HIF-1 activation in hypoxia since it is inhibited in the presence of geldanamycin. These results indicate that Hsp90 is a major regulator in HIF-1alpha activation.((PMID:25721560))Polymorphisms in the promoter region are likely to impact KISS1 gene transcription and reproductive traits. In this study, Guanzhong (GZ, n=350) and Boer (BE, n=196) goats were used to detect polymorphism in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene by DNA sequencing. In the GZ goats, the g.1384G>A mutation was identified in the promoter of the goat KISS1 gene. Guanzhong goats were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium at g.1384G>A locus (P<0.05). The 1384A allele was predicted to eliminate methylation, AHR-arnt heterodimers and AHR-related factors (AHRR) and myoblast determining factors (MYOD) transcription factor-binding sites. Statistical results indicated that the g.1384G>A SNP was associated with litter size in the GZ goats (P<0.05). Luciferase assay analysis suggested that the 1384A allele increased luciferase activity when compared to the 1384G allele. The RT-qPCR assay also demonstrated that the 1384A allele had greater amounts of KISS1 mRNA than the 1384G allele in homozygous individuals. Functional analysis suggested that this g.1384G>A SNP may be an important genetic regulator of KISS1 gene expression with effects on downstream processes that are modulated by KISS1 gene because of the changes of methylation and transcription factor-binding sites. Therefore, the current study provides evidence in goats for genetic markers that might be used in breeding programs.((PMID:22210883))The myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) gene is a master regulator of myogenesis. We previously reported that the expression of MyoD mRNA oscillates over 24 h in skeletal muscle and that the circadian clock transcription factors, BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1) and CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput), were bound to the core enhancer (CE) of the MyoD gene in vivo. In this study, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that the CE is necessary for circadian expression of MyoD in adult muscle. Gel shift assays identified a conserved non-canonical E-box within the CE that is bound by CLOCK and BMAL1. Functional analysis revealed that this E-box was required for full activation by BMAL1/CLOCK and for in vitro circadian oscillation. Expression profiling of muscle of CE(loxP/loxP) mice found approximately 1300 genes mis-expressed relative to wild-type. Based on the informatics results, we analyzed the respiratory function of mitochondria isolated from wild-type and CE(loxP/loxP) mice. These assays determined that State 5 respiration was significantly reduced in CE(loxP/loxP) muscle. The results of this work identify a novel element in the MyoD enhancer that confers circadian regulation to MyoD in skeletal muscle and suggest that loss of circadian regulation leads to changes in myogenic expression and downstream mitochondrial function.((PMID:15233999))Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, caused by the expansion of the (CAG)n tract in the MJD gene. This encodes the protein ataxin-3, of unknown function. The mouse Mjd gene has a structure similar to that of its human counterpart and it also contains a TATA-less promoter. Its 5' flanking region contains conserved putative binding regions for transcription factors Sp1, USF, Arnt, Max, E47, and MyoD. Upon differentiation of P19 cells, the Mjd gene promoter is preferentially activated in endodermal and mesodermal derivatives, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes; and less so in neuronal precursors. Mouse ataxin-3 is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development and in the adult, with strong expression in regions of the CNS affected in MJD. It is particularly abundant in all types of muscle and in ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting that it may be associated with the cytoskeleton and may have an important function in cell structure and/or motility.((PMID:15169898))Myogenesis is an intricate process that coordinately engages multiple intracellular signaling cascades. The Rho family GTPase RhoA is known to promote myogenesis, however, the mechanisms controlling its regulation in myoblasts have yet to be fully elucidated. We show here that the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, functions as an early modulator of myogenesis by regulating RhoA. When MyoD was expressed in fibroblasts lacking functional SHP-2, muscle-specific gene activity was impaired and abolition of SHP-2 expression by RNA interference inhibited muscle differentiation. By using SHP-2 substrate-trapping mutants, we identified p190-B RhoGAP as a SHP-2 substrate. When dephosphorylated, p190-B RhoGAP has been shown to stimulate the activation of RhoA. During myogenesis, p190-B RhoGAP was tyrosyl dephosphorylated concomitant with the stimulation of SHP-2's phosphatase activity. Moreover, overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 inhibited p190-B RhoGAP tyrosyl dephosphorylation, RhoA activity, and myogenesis. These observations strongly suggest that SHP-2 dephosphorylates p190-B RhoGAP, leading to the activation of RhoA. Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for RhoA activation in myoblasts and demonstrate that myogenesis is critically regulated by the actions of SHP-2 on the p190-B Rho GAP/RhoA pathway.((PMID:11493654))Myogenesis is a highly ordered process that involves the expression of muscle-specific genes, cell-cell recognition and multinucleated myotube formation. Although protein tyrosine kinases have figured prominently in myogenesis, the involvement of tyrosine phosphatases in this process is unknown. SHP-2 is an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, which positively regulates growth and differentiation. We show that in C2C12 myoblasts, SHP-2 becomes upregulated early on during myogenesis and associates with a 120 kDa tyrosyl-phosphorylated complex. We have identified that the 120 kDa complex consists of the SHP-2 substrate-1 (SHPS-1) and the Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab-1). SHPS-1, but not Gab-1, undergoes tyrosyl phosphorylation and association with SHP-2 during myogenesis, the kinetics of which correlate with the expression of MyoD. Either constitutive expression or inducible activation of MyoD in 10T(1/2) fibroblasts promotes SHPS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and its association with SHP-2. It has been shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is required for the expression/activation of MyoD and MyoD-responsive genes. Inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts blocks MyoD expression, SHPS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and the association of SHPS-1 with SHP-2. These data suggest that SHPS-1/SHP-2 complex formation is an integral signaling component of skeletal muscle differentiation.((PMID:9696036))Shp-2 is a ubiquitously expressed tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains. Homozygous mutant mice with a targeted deletion of 65 amino acid residues in the N-terminal SH2 domain of Shp-2 die in utero at mid-gestation, with multiple defects in mesodermal patterning. To surpass the embryonic lethality in dissecting the Shp-2 function in cell growth and differentiation, we established homozygous Shp-2 mutant embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. Our previous data showed a severe suppression of hematopoietic cell differentiation from Shp-2 mutant ES cells. Here we demonstrate that development of cardiac muscle cells was dramatically delayed and impaired in embryoid bodies (EBs) of Shp-2 mutant origin. Shp-2 mutant ES cells failed to differentiate into epithelial and fibroblast cells in vitro. However, higher efficiency of secondary EB formation was observed from the mutant than the wild-type ES cells. Further, mutant ES cells were more sensitive than wild-type cells to the differentiation suppressing effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In addition, mutant ES cells showed a reduced growth rate compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that the Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase is a positive regulator for both cell differentiation and proliferation, in contrast to the Src-family kinases which promote cell growth but block differentiation.((PMID:10406466))Classical ligand-activated nuclear receptors (e.g. thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor), orphan nuclear receptors (e.g. Rev-erbAalpha/beta), Mad/Max bHLH (basic helix loop helix)-LZ proteins, and oncoproteins, PLZF and LAZ3/BCL6, bind DNA and silence transcription by recruiting a repressor complex that contains N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor)/SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor), Sin3A/B, and HDAc-1/-2 proteins. The function of the corepressor, N-CoR, in the process of cellular differentiation and coupled phenotypic acquisition, has not been investigated. We examined the functional role of N-CoR in myogenesis (muscle differentiation), an ideal paradigm for the analysis of the determinative events that govern the cell's decision to divide or differentiate. We observed that the mRNA encoding N-CoR was suppressed as proliferating myoblasts exited the cell cycle, and formed morphologically and biochemically differentiated myotubes. Exogenous expression of N-CoR (but not RIP13) in myogenic cells ablated 1) myogenic differentiation, 2) the expression of the myoD gene family that encode the myogenic specific bHLH proteins, and 3) the crucial cell cycle regulator, p21Waf-1/Cip-1 mRNA. Furthermore, N-CoR expression efficiently inhibits the myoD-mediated myogenic conversion of pluripotential C3H10T1/2 cells. We demonstrate that MyoD-mediated transactivation and activity are repressed by N-CoR. The mechanism involves direct interactions between MyoD and N-CoR; moreover, the interaction was dependent on the amino-terminal repression domain (RD1) of N-CoR and the bHLH region of MyoD. Trichostatin A treatment significantly stimulated the activity of MyoD by approximately 10-fold and inhibited the ability of N-CoR to repress MyoD-mediated transactivation, consistent with the involvement of the corepressor and the recruitment of a histone deacteylase activity in the process. This work demonstrates that the corepressor N-CoR is a key regulator of MyoD activity and mammalian differentiation, and that N-CoR has a multifaceted role in myogenesis.((PMID:27493874))Sarcopenic obesity, age-related muscle loss, which is compensated by an increase in fat mass, impairs quality of life in elderly people. Although the increase in intramuscular fat is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and increased metabolic risk factors, the origin of diabetes-associated intramuscular fat has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated intramuscular fat deposition using a muscle injury model in type 2 diabetic mice.Male 8-week-old C57BL/6 and 8-week-old and 26-week-old KKAy underwent intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin (Ctx) (100 μL/10 μM) into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. After 2 weeks, the muscles were removed and evaluated.KKAy exhibited impaired muscle regeneration and ectopic fat deposition. Such impairment was more marked in older KKAy. These changes were also observed in another diabetic mouse model, db/db and diet-induced obese mice but not in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. Deposited fat was platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha positive and its cytoskeleton was stained with Masson's trichrome, indicating it to be of fibro-adipocyte progenitor cell origin. Expression of a myogenic marker, myoD, was lower and that of PDGF receptor alpha and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (CEBP) alpha was higher in Ctx-injured TA of KKAy compared with that of C57BL/6. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was highly expressed in fat-forming lesions in older KKAy. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid prevented the formation of intramuscular fat; however, treatment with GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, increased the fibrotic change in muscle.Diabetic mice showed impaired muscle regeneration with fat deposition, suggesting that diabetes may enhance sarcopenic obesity through a mechanism involving anomalous fibro-adipocyte progenitor cell differentiation.((PMID:17478558))T(3) regulates energy metabolism by stimulating metabolic rate and decreasing metabolic efficiency. The discovery of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), its homology to UCP1, and regulation by T(3) rendered it a possible molecular determinant of the action of T(3) on energy metabolism, but data are controversial. This controversy may in part be attributable to discrepancies observed between the regulation by T(3) of UCP3 expression in rats, humans, and mice. To clarify this issue, we studied 1) the induction kinetics of the UCP3 gene by T(3) in rat skeletal muscle, 2) the influence of fatty acids, and 3) the structure and regulation of the various UCP3 promoters by T(3). Within 8 h of single-dose T(3) administration, hypothyroid rats showed a rise in serum fatty acid levels concomitant with a rapid increase in UCP3 expression in gastrocnemius muscle, followed by inductions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) (within 24 h) and PPAR target gene expression (after 24 h). This T(3)-induced early UCP3 expression depended on fatty acid-PPAR signaling because depleting serum fatty acid levels abolished its expression, restorable by administration of the PPARdelta agonist L165,041 (4-[3-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)propoxy]phenoxy]acetic acid). In transfected rat L6 myoblasts, only the rat UCP3 promoter positively responded to T(3) and L165,041 together in the presence of MyoD, thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1), PPARdelta, or PPARdelta plus the TR dimerization partner retinoid X receptor alpha. All promoters share a response element common to TR and PPAR (TRE 1), but the observed species differences may be attributable to different localizations of the MyoD response element, which in the rat maps to exon 1.((PMID:16556763))Although physical interactions with other receptors have been reported, heterodimeric complexes of T(3) nuclear receptors (TR) with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are considered as major regulators of T(3) target gene expression. However, despite the potent T(3) influence in proliferating myoblasts, RXR isoforms are not expressed during proliferation, raising the question of the nature of the complex involved in TRalpha transcriptional activity. We have previously established that c-Jun induces TRalpha1 transcriptional activity in proliferating myoblasts not expressing RXR. This regulation is specific to the muscle lineage, suggesting the involvement of a muscle-specific factor. In this study, we found that MyoD expression in HeLa cells stimulates TRalpha1 activity, an influence potentiated by c-Jun coexpression. Similarly, in the absence of RXR, MyoD or c-Jun overexpression in myoblasts induces TRalpha1 transcriptional activity through a direct repeat 4 or an inverted palindrome 6 thyroid hormone response element. The highest rate of activity was recorded when c-Jun and MyoD were coexpressed. Using c-Jun-negative dominants, we established that MyoD influence on TRalpha1 activity needs c-Jun functionality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRalpha1 and MyoD physically interact in the hinge region of the receptor and the transactivation and basic helix loop helix domains of MyoD. RXR expression (spontaneously occurring at the onset of myoblast differentiation) in proliferating myoblasts abrogates these interactions. These data suggest that in the absence of RXR, TRalpha1 transcriptional activity in myoblasts is mediated through a complex including MyoD and c-Jun.((PMID:16322094))The regulation of gene expression by thyroid hormone (T3) involves binding of the hormone to nuclear receptors [thyroid hormone receptor (TR)] acting as T3-dependent transcription factors encoded by TRalpha (NR1A1) and TRbeta (NR1A2) genes. Several TRalpha variants have already been characterized, but only some of them display T3 binding activity. In this study, we have identified another transcript, TRalpha-DeltaE6, produced by alternative splicing with microexon 6b instead of exon 6. This splicing leads to the synthesis of a protein devoid of a hinge domain. The TRalpha-DeltaE6 transcript is detected in all mouse tissues tested. Although TRalpha-DeltaE6 did not bind DNA, its expression induced a TRalpha1 sequestration in the cytoplasm. Functional studies demonstrated that TRalpha-DeltaE6 inhibits the transcriptional activity of TRalpha1 and retinoic X receptor-alpha, but not of retinoic acid receptor-alpha. We also found that TRalpha-DeltaE6 efficiently decreased the ability of TRalpha to inhibit MyoD transcriptional activity during myoblast proliferation. Consequently, when overexpressed in myoblasts, it stimulated terminal differentiation. We suggest that this novel TRalpha variant may act as down regulator of overall T3 receptor activity, including its ability to repress MyoD transcriptional activity during myoblast proliferation.((PMID:12642900))Mammals have two major isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxyase (ACC). The 275 kDa beta-form (ACCbeta) is predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle while the 265 kDa alpha-form (ACCalpha) is the major isoform in lipogenic tissues such as liver and adipose tissue. ACCbeta is thought to control fatty acid oxidation by means of the ability of malonyl-CoA to inhibit carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase-1 (CPT-1), which is a rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. Previously, it was reported that MyoD and other muscle regulating factors (MRFs) up-regulate the expression of ACCbeta by interactions between these factors and several cis-elements of ACCbeta promoter. We described here that ACCbeta expression mediated by MRFs is regulated by retinoic acids. Endogenous expression of ACCbeta in differentiated H9C2 myotube was significantly increased by retinoic acid treatment. However, on transient transfection assay in H9C2 myoblast, ACCbeta promoter activity was suppressed by RXRalpha and more severely by RARalpha. These effects on ACCbeta expression in myoblasts and myotubes by RXRalpha and RARalpha seem to be mediated by their interactions with MRFs because no consensus sequence for RXRalpha and RARalpha has been found in ACCbeta promoter and retinoic acid receptors did not affect this promoter activities by itself. In transient transfection in NIH3T3 fibroblast, the activation of ACCbeta promoter by MyoD, main MRF in myoblast, was significantly suppressed by RARalpha and to a less extent by RXRalpha while the RXRalpha drastically augmented the activation by MRF4, major MRF in myotube. These results explained that retinoic acids differentially affected the action of MRFs according to their types and RXRalpha specially elevates the expression of muscle specific genes by stimulating the action of MRF4.((PMID:10234814))Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells grown in aggregates give rise to several different cell types, including cardiac muscle. Given the lack of cardiac muscle cell lines, ES cells can be a useful tool in the study of cardiac muscle differentiation. The laminin-binding integrin alpha 6 beta 1 exists in two different splice variant forms of the alpha chain (alpha 6A and alpha 6B), the alpha 6A form having been implicated as possibly playing a role in cardiac muscle development, based on its distribution pattern [4, 53]. In this study we characterise the ES cell model system in terms of the expression of the two different alpha 6 splice variants. We correlate their expression with that of muscle markers and the transcription factor GATA-4, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We confirm that alpha 6B is constitutively expressed by ES cells. In contrast, alpha 6A expression appears later and overlaps in time with a period when the muscle marker myosin light chain-2V (MLC-2V) is expressed, but no MyoD is present, which indicates the presence of cardiac muscle cells in the aggregates. We further show that GATA-4 is present at the same time. Culturing the aggregates under conditions that stimulate (transforming growth factor beta 1 supplement) or inhibit (TGF beta 1 plus 10(-9) M retinoic acid supplement) cardiac muscle differentiation does not lead to any qualitative differences in the timing of expression of these genes, but quantitative changes cannot be excluded. The TGF beta 1 supplement does, however, lead to a relatively greater expression of alpha 6A compared to alpha 6B than the TGF beta 1 plus 10(-9) M RA supplement after 6 days in culture, suggesting that alpha 6A expression is favoured under conditions that stimulate cardiac muscle differentiation. The switch towards alpha 6A expression in ES cell aggregates is paralleled by expression of the binding receptor for TGF beta (T beta RII). Stable expression of a mutated (dominant negative) T beta RII in ES cells, however, still resulted in (TGF beta-independent) upregulation of alpha 6A, demonstrating that these events were not causally related and that parallel or alternative regulatory pathways exist. The initial characterisation of differentiating ES cell aggregates in terms of alpha 6A integrin subunit expression suggests that this model system could be a valuable tool in the study of the role of the alpha 6A beta 1 integrin in cardiac muscle differentiation.((PMID:9559292))Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) are characterized by unique neoplastic cells demonstrating phenotypic diversity. By using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we have detected expression of various genes before and after differentiation induction with four different agents in four established MRT cell lines (TM87-16, STM91-01, TTC642, and TTC549). The agents used in this study were all-trans retinoic acid (RA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), interleukin-3, or interferon-gamma. Before and after induction, c-myc, IGF-II, IGF-I receptor, and IGF-II receptor were constitutively expressed by all four cell lines. The neurofilament medium-size (NF-M) was constitutively expressed by the TM87-16 and TTC642, and the S100 protein alpha subunit was expressed by TM87-16, TTC642, and TTC549. Chromogranin A was expressed by TM87-16 only after treatment with either TPA or RA. MyoD, N-myc, tyrosine hydroxylase, N-CAM, trkA, and the S100 protein beta subunit were not expressed by any cell line before or after induction with these agents. All the MRT cell lines in this study except TM87-16 were highly resistant to differentiation induction. The proliferating cells in TM87-16 and TTC642 expressed mRNA profiles characteristic of neuroectoderm.((PMID:7753622))COUP-TF II is an 'orphan steroid receptor' that binds a wide variety of AGGTCA repeats and represses thyroid hormone (T3) and retinoid dependent trans-activation; however, very little is known of its functional and/or developmental role during mammalian cell differentiation. T3 and retinoids have been demonstrated to promote terminal muscle differentiation via activation of the muscle specific myoD gene family (myoD, myogenin, myf-5 and MRF-4). The myoD gene family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages, repress proliferation, activate differentiation and the contractile phenotype. Hence, we investigated the expression and functional role of COUP-TF II during muscle differentiation. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts expressed COUP-TF II mRNA which was repressed when cells were induced to differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal. Concomitant with the decrease of COUP-TF II mRNA was the appearance of muscle specific mRNAs (e.g. myogenin, alpha-actin). We show that Escherichia coli expressed full length and truncated COUP-TF II bound in a sequence specific manner to the T3 response elements (TREs) in the myoD and myogenin regulatory HLH genes [Olson (1992) Dev. Biol. 154, 261-272]; and the TRE in the skeletal alpha-actin contractile protein gene. COUP-TF II diminished the homodimeric binding of the thyroid hormone receptor and the heterodimeric binding of thyroid hormone and retinoid X receptor complexes to these TREs. Constitutive over-expression of COUP-TF II cDNA in mouse C2C12 myogenic cells suppressed the levels of myoD mRNA and blocked the induction of myogenin mRNA, whereas constitutive expression of anti-sense COUP-TF II cDNA significantly increased the steady state levels of myoD mRNA and hyper-induced myogenin mRNA. These studies demonstrate for the first time (i) that COUP-TF II, functions as a physiologically relevant antagonistic regulator of myogenesis via direct effects on the myoD gene family and (ii) direct evidence for the developmental role of COUP-TF II during mammalian cell differentiation.((PMID:7874162))((PMID:8127707))Thyroid hormones are major determinants of skeletal muscle differentiation in vivo. Triiodo-L-thyronine treatment promotes terminal muscle differentiation and results in increased MyoD gene transcription in myogenic cell lines; furthermore myoD and fast myosin heavy chain gene expression are activated in rodent slow twitch muscle fibers (Molecular Endocrinology 6: 1185-1194, 1992; Development 118: 1137-1147, 1993). We have identified a T3 response element (TRE) in the mouse MyoD promoter between nucleotide positions -337 and -309 (5' CTGAGGTCAGTACAGGCTGGAGGAGTAGA 3'). This sequence conferred an appropriate T3 response to an enhancerless SV40 promoter. In vitro binding studies showed that the thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR alpha) formed a heterodimeric complex, with either the retinoid X receptor alpha or gamma 1 isoforms (RXR alpha, RXR gamm), on the MyoD TRE that was specifically competed by other well characterised TREs and not by other response elements. Analyses of this heterodimer with a battery of steroid hormone response elements indicated that the complex was efficiently competed by a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif separated by 4 nucleotides as predicted by the 3-4-5 rule. EMSA experiments demonstrated that the nuclear factor(s) present in muscle cells that bound to the myoD TRE were constitutively expressed during myogenesis; this complex was competed by the myosin heavy chain, DR-4 and PAL-0 TREs in a sequence specific fashion. Western blot analysis indicated that TR alpha 1 was constitutively expressed during C2C12 differentiation. Mutagenesis of the myoD TRE indicated that the sequence of the direct repeats (AGGTCA) and the 4 nucleotide gap were necessary for efficient binding to the TR alpha/RXR alpha heterodimeric complex. In conclusion our data suggest that the TRE in the helix loop helix gene, myoD, is a target for the direct heterodimeric binding of TR alpha and RXR alpha/gamma. These results provide a molecular mechanism/model for the effects of triiodo-L-thyronine on in vitro myogenesis; the activation of myoD gene expression in the slow twitch fibres and the cascade of myogenic events regulated by thyroid hormone.((PMID:8318458))The leukocyte adhesion receptors M290 (alpha M290/beta 7) and LPAM-1 (alpha 4 beta 7) comprise the beta 7-subfamily of integrins, which are constitutively expressed on subsets of lymphocytes populating the mouse small intestine. They are induced de novo after in vitro activation of lymphocytes and hence may serve a more general role in inflammation. In order to understand how beta 7 integrins are regulated during an immune response, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of the beta 7 gene. Primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends identified one major transcriptional start site in a favourable context, which resembles the initiator of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Transfection assays with a luciferase reporter gene revealed that cell-specific expression in vitro was retained in a 292 bp sequence, which contained several consensus binding motifs for transcriptional factors preferentially expressed in cells of the lymphoid lineages. Multiple retinoic acid receptor sites for steroid/thyroid hormone receptors which typify the leukocyte cell adhesion molecule subset of integrins are present. The beta 7 promoter, like its alpha 4 chain partner, contains the E box core sequence CACCTG found within the muscle creatine kinase enhancer which binds MyoD in vitro. The number of potential DNA binding sites for transcriptional factors in the beta 7 promoter parallels the complex regulation of expression of M290 and LPAM-1 in inflammation and gut mucosal immunity.((PMID:11024001))The uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle. UCP-3 mRNA is expressed in cultured muscle cells (C2C12 or L6E9) only when differentiated, at which stage UCP-3 is highly induced by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). Here we report that human UCP-3 promoter activity is dependent on MyoD and inducible by all trans-RA. The action of all trans-RA is increased by co-transfection with RA receptor (RAR). We have characterized the RA response element that controls the induction by RA in the 5' noncoding region of the UCP-3 gene. Deletion and point-mutation analysis of the hUCP-3 promoter led us to identify a direct-repeat element with one base-pair spacing (DR1) at position -71/-59 responsible for the induction by RA of the activity of the promoter. This DR1 element bound a nuclear protein complex from muscle cells that contain RAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR). In the absence of this element, the promoter became unresponsive to RA, but it was still dependent on MyoD. In conclusion, it has been established that UCP-3 gene promoter activity is dependent on MyoD, and the first regulatory pathway for UCP-3 gene promoter regulation has been recognized by identifying RA as a transcriptional activator of the gene.((PMID:9464546))In C2 myoblasts, retinoic acid (RA) is an efficient inducer of both growth arrest and differentiation. These RA effects are mediated through at least two classes of retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs), which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. To determine the role played by each RAR or RXR family in this model system, we have analysed the effects of RA in C2 myoblasts expressing a dominant negative RAR (dnRAR) or a dominant negative RXR (dnRXR). The stable expression of dnRAR or dnRXR in C2 cells delays the RA-induced growth arrest and differentiation, an effect which is more pronounced in C2-dnRXR myoblasts. Furthermore, the RA-inducible expression of MyoD gene is lost in C2-dnRXR but not in C2-dnRAR cells, indicating that each family of retinoid receptors RAR and RXR may regulate distinct subsets of RA-responsive genes. Finally, using C2 cell lines with different retinoid responsiveness, we provided evidence for a link between the RXR and MyoD families in the process of myogenic differentiation. These results illustrate a critical role for RA-receptors in RA-control of C2 myogenesis and provide tools for studying the function of RA and its receptors during vertebrate development.((PMID:8194491))Retinoids (all trans and 9-cis retinoic acid) are pleiotropic regulators of cell fate, and have been shown to regulate the expression of helix loop helix transcription factors (e.g MyoD, myogenin and Myf-5) that control myogenic differentiation. The effects of retinoids are mediated through the ligand dependent retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). We have found that the messenger RNA transcripts encoding RAR are repressed during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts while, conversely, RXR mRNA transcripts are induced in C2C12 myotubes. These results imply that RXRs, play a major regulatory role in differentiated muscle.((PMID:19814781))Understanding stem cell differentiation is essential for the future design of cell therapies. While retinoic acid (RA) is the most potent small molecule enhancer of skeletal myogenesis in stem cells, the stage and mechanism of its function has not yet been elucidated. Further, the intersection of RA with other signalling pathways that stimulate or inhibit myogenesis (such as Wnt and BMP4, respectively) is unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which RA enhances skeletal myogenesis and interacts with Wnt and BMP4 signalling during P19 or mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation.Treatment of P19 or mouse ES cells with low levels of RA led to an enhancement of skeletal myogenesis by upregulating the expression of the mesodermal marker, Wnt3a, the skeletal muscle progenitor factors Pax3 and Meox1, and the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) MyoD and myogenin. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, RA receptors (RARs) bound directly to regulatory regions in the Wnt3a, Pax3, and Meox1 genes and RA activated a beta-catenin-responsive promoter in aggregated P19 cells. In the presence of a dominant negative beta-catenin/engrailed repressor fusion protein, RA could not bypass the inhibition of skeletal myogenesis nor upregulate Meox1 or MyoD. Thus, RA functions both upstream and downstream of Wnt signalling. In contrast, it functions downstream of BMP4, as it abrogates BMP4 inhibition of myogenesis and Meox1, Pax3, and MyoD expression. Furthermore, RA downregulated BMP4 expression and upregulated the BMP4 inhibitor, Tob1. Finally, RA inhibited cardiomyogenesis but not in the presence of BMP4.RA can enhance skeletal myogenesis in stem cells at the muscle specification/progenitor stage by activating RARs bound directly to mesoderm and skeletal muscle progenitor genes, activating beta-catenin function and inhibiting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. Thus, a signalling pathway can function at multiple levels to positively regulate a developmental program and can function by abrogating inhibitory pathways. Finally, since RA enhances skeletal muscle progenitor formation, it will be a valuable tool for designing future stem cell therapies.((PMID:12399463))Betaglycan is a membrane-anchored proteoglycan co-receptor that binds transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) via its core protein and basic fibroblast growth factor through its glycosaminoglycan chains. In this study we evaluated the expression of betaglycan during the C(2)C(12) skeletal muscle differentiation. Betaglycan expression, as determined by Northern and Western blot, was up-regulated during the conversion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mouse betaglycan gene promoter was cloned, and its sequence showed putative binding sites for SP1, Smad3, Smad4, muscle regulatory factor elements such as MyoD and MEF2, and retinoic acid receptor. Transcriptional activity of the mouse betaglycan promoter reporter was also up-regulated in differentiating C(2)C(12) cells. We found that MyoD, but not myogenin, stimulated this transcriptional activity even in the presence of high serum. Betaglycan promoter activity was increased by RA and inhibited by the three isoforms of TGF-beta. On the other hand, basic fibroblast growth factor, BMP-2, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, which are inhibitors of myogenesis, had little effect. In myotubes, up-regulated betaglycan was also detectable by TGF-beta affinity labeling and immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The latter indicated that betaglycan was localized both on the cell surface and in the ECM. Forced expression of betaglycan in C(2)C(12) myoblasts increases their responsiveness to TGF-beta2, suggesting that it performs a TGF-beta presentation function in this cell lineage. These results indicate that betaglycan expression is up-regulated during myogenesis and that MyoD and RA modulate its expression by a mechanism that is independent of myogenin.((PMID:9535553))The signal transduction mechanism coupled to angiotensin AT2 receptors is still a matter of debate. Based on the findings that AT2 receptor stimulation causes inhibition of proliferation, and that other antiproliferative agents such as transforming growth factor-beta, retinoic acid, and MyoD act via repression of immediate early gene (IEG) expression, this study was aimed at elucidating whether downregulation of IEG expression is also part of the AT2 receptor coupled signaling mechanism. Stimulation of angiotensin AT2 receptors in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 W following pretreatment with growth factors was able to counteract growth factor induced proliferation but not to repress growth factor induced c-fos and c-jun expression; neither did AT2 receptor stimulation cause an induction of c-fos expression. We conclude that, in contrast to other growth-inhibiting agents, the antiproliferative effect of angiotensin II via the AT2 receptor is not mediated by repression of the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun.((PMID:22192089))Bone repair is dependent on the presence of osteocompetent progenitors that are able to differentiate and generate new bone. Muscle is found in close association with orthopaedic injury, however its capacity to make a cellular contribution to bone repair remains ambiguous. We hypothesized that myogenic cells of the MyoD-lineage are able to contribute to bone repair.We employed a MyoD-Cre+:Z/AP+ conditional reporter mouse in which all cells of the MyoD-lineage are permanently labeled with a human alkaline phosphatase (hAP) reporter. We tracked the contribution of MyoD-lineage cells in mouse models of tibial bone healing.In the absence of musculoskeletal trauma, MyoD-expressing cells are limited to skeletal muscle and the presence of reporter-positive cells in non-muscle tissues is negligible. In a closed tibial fracture model, there was no significant contribution of hAP+ cells to the healing callus. In contrast, open tibial fractures featuring periosteal stripping and muscle fenestration had up to 50% of hAP+ cells detected in the open fracture callus. At early stages of repair, many hAP+ cells exhibited a chondrocyte morphology, with lesser numbers of osteoblast-like hAP+ cells present at the later stages. Serial sections stained for hAP and type II and type I collagen showed that MyoD-lineage cells were surrounded by cartilaginous or bony matrix, suggestive of a functional role in the repair process. To exclude the prospect that osteoprogenitors spontaneously express MyoD during bone repair, we created a metaphyseal drill hole defect in the tibia. No hAP+ staining was observed in this model suggesting that the expression of MyoD is not a normal event for endogenous osteoprogenitors.These data document for the first time that muscle cells can play a significant secondary role in bone repair and this knowledge may lead to important translational applications in orthopaedic surgery. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/9/136.((PMID:25233141))Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is important to normal development. However, the function of the different RA receptors (RARs)--RARα, RARβ, and RARγ--is as yet unclear. We have used wild-type and transgenic zebrafish to examine the role of RARγ. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with an RARγ-specific agonist reduced somite formation and axial length, which was associated with a loss of hoxb13a expression and less-clear alterations in hoxc11a or myoD expression. Treatment with the RARγ agonist also disrupted formation of tissues arising from cranial neural crest, including cranial bones and anterior neural ganglia. There was a loss of Sox 9-immunopositive neural crest stem/progenitor cells in the same anterior regions. Pectoral fin outgrowth was blocked by RARγ agonist treatment. However, there was no loss of Tbx-5-immunopositive lateral plate mesodermal stem/progenitor cells and the block was reversed by agonist washout or by cotreatment with an RARγ antagonist. Regeneration of the caudal fin was also blocked by RARγ agonist treatment, which was associated with a loss of canonical Wnt signaling. This regenerative response was restored by agonist washout or cotreatment with the RARγ antagonist. These findings suggest that RARγ plays an essential role in maintaining stem/progenitor cells during embryonic development and tissue regeneration when the receptor is in its nonligated state.((PMID:19012474))P19 embryonic carcinoma cells resemble normal embryonic stem (ES) cells. They generate cardiac and skeletal myocytes in response to retinoic acid (RA) or oxytocin (OT). RA treatment followed by exposure to triiodothyronine (T3) and insulin induces ES cells differentiation into adipocytes and skeletomyocytes. On the other hand, OT (10(-7) M) was reported to inhibit 3T3 preadipocyte maturation. The present work was undertaken to determine whether P19 cells have an adipogenic potential that could be affected by OT. Cells were treated with RA (10(-6) M)/T3+insulin (adipogenic protocol) or 10(-7) M OT (cardiomyogenic protocol), and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, immunotechniques, and cytochemistry. Oil-Red-O staining and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and aP2 indicated the generation of adipocytes in cultures submitted to the adipogenic protocol. Contracting cells were also generated. Cells positive for sarcomeric actinin and negative for cardiac troponin inhibitor (cTpnI) indicated generation of skeletomyocytes, and cTpnI positive cells revealed generation of cardiomyocytes. Levels of cTpnI and of the skeletal marker MyoD were almost similar in both protocols, whereas no Oil-Red-O staining was associated with the cardiomyogenic protocol. Addition of 10(-7) M OT to the adipogenic protocol did not affect Oil-Red-O staining and PPARgamma expression. Interestingly, Oct3/4 pluripotency marker disappeared in the adipogenic protocol but remained expressed in the cardiomyogenic one. P19 cells thus have an adipogenic potential non affected by 10(-7) M OT. RA/T3+insulin combination generates a larger spectrum of mesodermal cell derivatives and is a more potent morphogenic treatment than OT. P19 cells could help investigating mechanisms of cell fate decision during development.((PMID:19121967))Glycerol kinase (GK) is at the interface of fat and carbohydrate metabolism and has been linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of GK in fat metabolism and insulin signaling in skeletal muscle (an important end organ tissue in T2DM). Microarray analysis determined that there were 525 genes that were differentially expressed (1.2-fold, p value<0.05) between knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed the differential expression of genes including glycerol kinase (Gyk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit, polypeptide 1 (p85 alpha) (Pik3r1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1), and growth factor receptor bound protein 2-associated protein 1 (Gab1). Network component analysis demonstrated that transcription factor activities of myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD), myogenic regulatory factor 5 (MYF5), myogenin (MYOG), nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (NUR77) are decreased in the Gyk KO whereas the activity of paired box 3 (PAX3) is increased. The activity of MYOD was confirmed using a DNA binding assay. In addition, myoblasts from Gyk KO had less ability to differentiate into myotubes compared to WT myoblasts. These findings support our previous studies in brown adipose tissue and demonstrate that the role of Gyk in muscle is due in part to its non-metabolic (moonlighting) activities.((PMID:9207240))KK mice are genetically diabetic animals, showing glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We examined the effects of 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) on the blood glucose level and on mRNA levels of muscle cell differentiation markers in hyperglycemic KK mice. T3 treatment (T1, 1 mg; T3, 3 mg; T10, 10 mg/kg/day) of KK mice for 4 days caused a decrease in blood glucose level by 11%, 25%, and 24%, respectively, without affecting body weight. Skeletal muscle of mice treated with T3 (T10) showed a 98% increase in the mRNA level of the glucose transporter isotype 4 (Glut4). In contrast, T3 treatment did not affect the mRNA level of the isotype 1 (Glut1) transporter. The mRNA level of a muscle cell specific differentiation marker, MyoD, showed a significant increase in the T3 treatment group with an accompanying enhancement of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA level. These results suggest that T3 stimulates muscle cell differentiation in vivo, concomitant with a stimulation of cellular glucose metabolism, thus decreasing the blood glucose level in hyperglycemic KK mice.((PMID:8941652))Insulin resistance is a predictor of the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in humans. It is unclear whether insulin resistance is a primary defect leading to NIDDM or the result of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. To determine if insulin resistance is the result of extrinsic factors such as hyperinsulinemia primary skeletal muscle cell cultures were established from muscle biopsies from Pima Indians with differing in vivo insulin sensitivities. These cell cultures expressed a variety of muscle-specific phenotypes including the proteins alpha-actinin and myosin, muscle-specific creatine kinase activity, and RNA encoding GLUT4, MYF5, MYOD1, and MYOGENIN. Labeled glucose was used to measure the insulin-stimulated conversion of glucose to glycogen in these cultures. The in vivo rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen production (insulin resistance) were correlated with in vitro measures of glycogen production (P = 0.007, r = 0.58). This defect in insulin action is stable in a uniform culture environment and is retained over time. The retention of insulin resistance in myoblast derived cell cultures is consistent with the expression of an underlying biochemical defect in insulin resistant skeletal muscle.((PMID:10915743))The helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of transcriptional regulatory proteins are key regulators in numerous developmental processes. The class I HLH proteins, such as E12 are ubiquitously expressed. Class II HLH proteins, such as MyoD, are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Class I and II heterodimers can bind to E-boxes (CANNTG) and regulate lineage commitments of embryonic cells. In an attempt to identify partners for the E12 protein that may exert control during liver development, we performed the yeast 2-hybrid screen using an expression complementary DNA library from human fetal liver. A novel dominant inhibitory HLH factor, designated HHM (human homologue of maid), was isolated and characterized. HHM is structurally related to the Id family and was highly expressed in brain, pituitary gland, lung, heart, placenta, fetal liver, and bone marrow. HHM physically interacted with E12 in vitro and in mammalian cells. Comparison of the dominant inhibitory effects of HHM and Id2 on the binding of E12/MyoD dimer to an E-box element revealed a weaker inhibition by HHM. However, HHM but not Id2 specifically inhibited the luciferase gene activation induced by hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) promoter. The HHM was transiently expressed during stem-cell-driven regeneration of the liver at the stage in which the early basophilic foci of hepatocytes started to appear. These results suggest that HHM is a novel type of dominant inhibitory HLH protein that might modulate liver-specific gene expression.((PMID:21673099))Skeletal muscle wasting is an important public health problem associated with aging, chronic disease, cancer, kidney dialysis, and HIV/AIDS. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-D3), the active form of vitamin D, is widely recognized for its regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in relation to bone development and maintenance and for its calcemic effects on target organs, such as intestine, kidney, and parathyroid glands. Emerging evidence has shown that vitamin D administration improves muscle performance and reduces falls in vitamin D-deficient older adults. However, little is known of the underlying mechanism or the role 1,25-D3 plays in promoting myogenic differentiation at the cellular and/or molecular level. In this study, we examined the effect of 1,25-D3 on myoblast cell proliferation, progression, and differentiation into myotubes. C(2)C(12) myoblasts were treated with 1,25-D3 or placebo for 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 d. Vitamin D receptor expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blottings and immunofluorescence. Expression of muscle lineage, pro- and antimyogenic, and proliferation markers was assessed by immunocytochemistry, PCR arrays, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blottings. Addition of 1,25-D3 to C(2)C(12) myoblasts 1) increased expression and nuclear translocation of the vitamin D receptor, 2) decreased cell proliferation, 3) decreased IGF-I expression, and 4) promoted myogenic differentiation by increasing IGF-II and follistatin expression and decreasing the expression of myostatin, the only known negative regulator of muscle mass, without changing growth differentiation factor 11 expression. This study identifies key vitamin D-related molecular pathways for muscle regulation and supports the rationale for vitamin D intervention studies in select muscle disorder conditions.((PMID:27018098))An adequate vitamin D status is essential to optimize muscle strength. However, whether vitamin D directly reduces muscle fiber atrophy or stimulates muscle fiber hypertrophy remains subject of debate. A mechanism that may affect the role of vitamin D in the regulation of muscle fiber size is the local conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2 D by 1α-hydroxylase. Therefore, we investigated in a murine C2C12 myoblast culture whether both 1,25(OH)2 D3 and 25(OH)D3 affect myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and myotube size and whether these cells are able to metabolize 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2 D3 . We show that myoblasts not only responded to 1,25(OH)2 D3 , but also to the precursor 25(OH)D3 by increasing their VDR mRNA expression and reducing their proliferation. In differentiating myoblasts and myotubes 1,25(OH)2 D3 as well as 25(OH)D3 stimulated VDR mRNA expression and in myotubes 1,25(OH)2 D3 also stimulated MHC mRNA expression. However, this occurred without notable effects on myotube size. Moreover, no effects on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as well as MyoD and myogenin mRNA levels were observed. Interestingly, both myoblasts and myotubes expressed CYP27B1 and CYP24 mRNA which are required for vitamin D3 metabolism. Although 1α-hydroxylase activity could not be shown in myotubes, after treatment with 1,25(OH)2 D3 or 25(OH)D3 myotubes showed strongly elevated CYP24 mRNA levels compared to untreated cells. Moreover, myotubes were able to convert 25(OH)D3 to 24R,25(OH)2 D3 which may play a role in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. These data suggest that skeletal muscle is not only a direct target for vitamin D3 metabolites, but is also able to metabolize 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2 D3 . J. Cell.

However, the effects of vitamin D and AGEs on myogenesis and the interaction between muscle and bone remains still unclear. We previously showed that osteoglycin (OGN) is secreted from myoblasts and stimulates osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting that it plays important roles in the interaction between muscle and bone. The aim of this study is thus to examine the effects of vitamin D and AGEs on myoblastic differentiation of C2C12 cells and osteoblastic differentiation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells through OGN expression. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) and eldecalcitol, an active vitamin D analog, induced the expression of MyoD, myogenin and OGN, and these effects were abolished by vitamin D receptor (VDR) suppression by siRNA in C2C12 cells. Moreover, conditioned medium from 1,25D-pretreated C2C12 cells stimulated the expression of type 1 collagen and alkaline phosphatase in MC3T3-E1 cells, compared to control medium from 1,25D-untreated C2C12 cells. In contrast, conditioned medium from VDR-suppressed and 1,25D-pretreated C2C12 cells showed no effects. AGE2 and AGE3 suppressed the expression of MyoD, myogenin and OGN in C2C12 cells. Moreover, 1,25D blunted the AGEs' effects. In conclusion, these findings showed for the first time that active vitamin D plays important roles in myogenesis and muscle-induced osteoblastogenesis through OGN expression. Active vitamin D treatment may rescue the AGEs-induced sarcopenia as well as - suppressed osteoblastic differentiation via OGN expression in myoblasts.((PMID:15775165))Patients with vitamin D insufficiency often exhibit muscle weakness and/or atrophy which can be cured by vitamin D and Ca supplementation. However, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. The direct effects of vitamin D on skeletal muscle cells include induction of transcription factors such as c-myc (genomic action) ;and activation of Ca channels, Src tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase (non-genomic action). Recent studies on VDR gene knockout mice revealed that VDR also regulates expression of the MyoD family of transcription factors in skeletal muscle. Thus, vitamin D and Ca appear to regulate proliferation, maturation and function of skeletal muscle through these complex actions.((PMID:8614403))Rev-erbA alpha is an orphan steroid receptor that is expressed in skeletal muscle. Rev-erbA alpha binds to single/tandem copies of an AGGTCA motif, is transcribed on the noncoding strand of the c-erbA- alpha gene locus, and is postulated to modulate the thyroid hormone (T3) response. T3 induces terminal muscle differentiation and regulates fiber type composition via direct activation of the muscle-specific myoD gene family (e.g. myoD, myogenin). The myoD gene family can direct the fate of mesodermal cell lineages and activate muscle differentiation. Hence we investigated the expression and physiological role of Rev-erbA alpha during myogenesis. We observed abundant levels of Rev-erbA alpha mRNA in dividing C2C12 myoblasts, which were suppressed when the cells differentiated into postmitotic multinucleated myotubes. This decrease in Rev-erbA alpha mRNA correlated with the appearance of muscle-specific mRNAs (e.g. myogenin and alpha-actin). Constitutive overexpression of full length Rev-erbA alpha cDNA in the myogenic cells completely abolished differentiation, suppressed myoD mRNA levels, and abrogated the induction of myogenin mRNA. We then demonstrated that 1) GAL4-REV-erbA alpha chimeras that contain the 'AB' region and lack the 'E' region activated transcription of GAL4 response elements in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP and 2) the ligand-binding domain (LBD) contains an active transcriptional silencer. Overexpression of Rev-erbA alpha (delta AB) in myogenic cells had no impact on the ability of these cells to morphologically or biochemically differentiate. Furthermore, this orphan receptor 1) down-regulated thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/T3 mediated transcriptional activity from the myogenin promoter and thyroid hormone response element (TRE) an 2) disrupted TR homodimer and TR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer formation on a number of TREs found in the myoD gene family. In conclusion, Rev-erbA alpha functions as a negative regulator of myogenesis by targeting the expression of the myoD gene family. The mechanism of action may involve inhibition of functional TR/RXR heterodimer formation on critical TREs and dominant trans-repression of gene expression.((PMID:15862566))The zebrafish fushi tarazu factor-1a (ff1a) is a transcription factor belonging to the NR5A subgroup of nuclear receptors. The NR5A receptors bind DNA as monomers and are considered to be orphans due to their ability to promote transcription of downstream genes without ligands. In zebrafish, four ff1 homologues (Ff1a, Ff1b, Ff1c, and Ff1d) have been identified so far. The gene coding for Ff1a is driven by two separate promoters, and give rise to four splice variants. Ff1a is expressed in the somites and pronephric ducts during somitogenesis and in the brain, liver, and mandibular arch during later embryonic stages. In adults the gene is highly expressed in gonads, liver, and intestine, but can be detected in most tissues. The broad variety of embryonic expression domains indicates several important developmental features. One of the mammalian fushi tarazu factor-1 genes, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), is essential for the development of gonads and adrenals. SF-1 is together with Sox9, WT1, and GATA4 a positive transcriptional regulator of human anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and thereby linked to the male sex-determining pathway. The zebrafish ff1a dual promoter contains several GATA binding sites and E-boxes, a site for DR4, XFD2, MyoD, Snail, HNF3, S8, and an HMG-box recognition site for Sox9. In a first attempt to dissect the ff1a promoter in vivo we have produced first generation transgenes in order to determine the correlation between the expression of the endogenous ff1a gene and the microinjected ff1a dual promoter coupled to the pEGFP reporter vector. Our results show that the microinjected constructs are expressed in the correct tissues.((PMID:27490527))Coumaric acid (CA) is a phenolic acid of the hydroxycinnamic acid family, and it has many biological functions such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-ulcer, anti-platelet, anti-cancer activities, etc. In the present study, we planned to analyse the potential molecular function of CA on skeletal muscle and preadipocytes differentiation using PCR and Western blot techniques. First, we analysed the impact of CA on C2C12 skeletal muscle differentiation. It revealed that CA treatment inhibited horse serum-induced skeletal muscle differentiation as evidenced by the decreased expression of early myogenic differentiation markers such as Myogenin and myoD via the AMP activated protein kinase- alpha AMPK-α mediated pathway. Furthermore, the level of lipid accumulation and changes in genes and protein expressions that are associated with lipogenesis and lipolysis were analyzed in 3T3-L1 cells. The Oil Red O staining evidenced that CA treatment inhibited lipid accumulation at the concentration of 0.1 and 0.2 mM. Furthermore, coumaric acid treatment decreased the expression of main transcriptional factors such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBP-α) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPAR-γ2). Subsequently, CA treatment decreased the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and adiponectin. Finally, we identified conformational changes induced by CA in PPAR-γ2 using computational biology tools. It revealed that CA might downregulate the PPAR-γ2 expression by directly binding with amino acids of PPAR-γ2 by hydrogen at 3.26 distance and hydrophobic interactions at 3.90 contact distances. These data indicated that CA suppressed skeletal muscle and preadipocytes differentiation through downregulation of the main transcriptional factors and their downstream targets.((PMID:26768366))Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARβ/δ) regulates postnatal myogenesis by alleviating myostatin activity, but the molecular mechanisms by which it regulates myogenesis are not fully understood. In this study, we investigate molecular mechanisms of PPARβ/δ in myoblast differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts treated with a PPARβ/δ agonist, GW0742 exhibit enhanced myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. GW0742 treatment dramatically activates promyogenic kinases, p38MAPK and Akt, in a dose-dependent manner. GW0742-stimulated myoblast differentiation is mediated by p38MAPK and Akt, since it failed to restore myoblast differentiation repressed by inhibition of p38MAPK and Akt. In addition, GW0742 treatment enhances MyoD-reporter activities. Consistently, overexpression of PPARβ/δ enhances myoblast differentiation accompanied by elevated activation of p38MAPK and Akt. Collectively, these results suggest that PPARβ/δ enhances myoblast differentiation through activation of promyogenic signaling pathways.((PMID:25919922))To determine whether super-activation of PPARγ can reprogram human myoblasts into brown-like adipocytes and to establish a new cell model for browning research.To enhance the PPARγ signaling, M3, the transactivation domain of MyoD, was fused to PPARγ. PPARγ and M3-PPARγ-lentiviral vectors were used to convert human myoblasts into adipocytes. Brown adipocyte markers of the reprogrammed adipocytes were assessed by qPCR and protein analyses. White adipocytes differentiated from subcutaneous stromal vascular cells and perithyroid brown fat tissues were used as references.In transient transfections, M3-PPARγ had a stronger constitutive activity than PPARγ by reporter assay. Although the transduction of either PPARγ or M3-PPARγ induced adipogenesis in myoblasts, M3-PPARγ drastically induced the brown adipocyte markers of UCP1, CIDEA, and PRDM16 by 1,050, 2.4, and 5.0 fold, respectively and increased mitochondria contents by 4 fold, compared to PPARγ.Super-activation of PPARγ can effectively convert human myoblasts into brown-like adipocytes and a new approach to derive brown-like adipocytes.((PMID:25668741))This study determined whether estradiol (E2) or the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein regulate expression of growth-related and lipogenic genes in rainbow trout. Juvenile fish (5 mon, 65.8±1.8 g) received intraperitoneal injections of E2, genistein, or daidzein (5 μg/g body weight) or a higher dose of genistein (50 μg/g body weight). Liver and white muscle were harvested 24h post-injection. In liver, expression of vitellogenin (vtg) and estrogen receptor alpha (era1) increased in all treatments and reflected treatment estrogenicity (E2>genistein (50 μg/g)>genistein (5 μg/g)=daidzein (5 μg/g)). Estradiol and genistein (50 μg/g) reduced components of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis in liver, including increased expression of IGF binding protein-2b1 (igfbp2b1) and reduced igfbp5b1. In liver E2 and genistein (50 μg/g) affected expression of components of the transforming growth factor beta signaling mechanism, reduced expression of ppar and rxr transcription factors, and increased expression of fatty acid synthesis genes srebp1, acly, fas, scd1, and gpat and lipid binding proteins fabp3 and lpl. In muscle E2 and genistein (50 μg/g) increased era1 and erb1 expression and decreased erb2 expression. Other genes responded to phytoestrogens in a manner that suggested regulation by estrogen receptor-independent mechanisms, including increased ghr2, igfbp2a, igfbp4, and igfbp5b1. Expression of muscle regulatory factors pax7 and myod was increased by E2 and genistein. These data indicate that genistein and daidzein affect expression of genes in rainbow trout that regulate physiological mechanisms central to growth and nutrient retention.((PMID:25646693))Myostatin (MSTN) is a secreted protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family that is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and also functions in adipocyte maturation. Studies have shown that MSTN can inhibit adipogenesis in muscle satellite cells (MSCs) but not in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). However, the mechanism by which MSTN differently regulates adipogenesis in these two cell types remains unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and myogenic differentiation factor (MyoD) are two key transcription factors in fat and muscle cell development that influence adipogenesis. To investigate whether MSTN differentially regulates PPARγ and MyoD, we analyzed PPARγ and MyoD expression by assessing mRNA, protein and methylation levels in ADSCs and MSCs after treatment with 100 ng/mL MSTN for 0, 24, and 48 h. PPARγ mRNA levels were downregulated after 24 h and upregulated after 48 h of treatment in ADSCs, whereas in MSCs, PPARγ levels were downregulated at both time points. MyoD expression was significantly increased in ADSCs and decreased in MSCs. PPARγ and MyoD protein levels were upregulated in ADSCs and downregulated in MSCs. The CpG methylation levels of the PPARγ and MyoD promoters were decreased in ADSCs and increased in MSCs. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the different regulatory adipogenic roles of MSTN in ADSCs and MSCs act by differentially regulating PPARγ and MyoD expression.((PMID:25006073))Twenty-four pregnant Nellore cows were randomly assigned into 2 feeding level groups (control [CTL]; fed 1.0 times the maintenance requirement; n = 12; and overnourished [ON]; fed at 1.5 times the maintenance requirement; n = 12) to evaluate effects of maternal overnutrition on fetal skeletal muscle development. Cows were slaughtered at 135, 190, and 240 d of gestation and samples of fetal LM were collected for analysis of mRNA expression analysis and for histological evaluation of collagen content and number of muscle cells. There was no interaction between gestational period and maternal nutrition for the variables evaluated (P > 0.05). The mRNA expression of Cadherin-associated protein, β 1 (β-catenin) tended to be greater in fetuses from ON cows (P = 0.08), while myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD; P = 0.56), myogenin (MyoG; P = 0.70), and the number of muscle cells (P = 0.90) were not affected by maternal overnutrition. Gestational period did not affect the mRNA expression of β-catenin (P = 0.60) and MyoG (P = 0.21). The mRNA expression of MyoD tended to increase with days of gestation (P = 0.06). The mRNA expression of zinc finger protein 423 (Zfp423; P < 0.0001), C/EBPα (P = 0.01), and PPARγ (P < 0.0001) were enhanced in ON fetuses. No effects of days of gestation were observed for mRNA expression of Zfp423 (P = 0.75) and C/EBPα (P = 0.48). The mRNA expression of PPARγ in fetuses at 190 d of gestation tended to be greater than those at 135 and 240 d of gestation (P = 0.06). The mRNA expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β; P < 0.0001), collagen type III, α I (COL3A1; P < 0.0001), and collagen content (P = 0.01) were increased in ON fetuses. Gestational period did not affect the mRNA expression of collagen type I, α I (COL1A1; P = 0.65). The mRNA expression of COL3A1 (P = 0.09) in fetuses at 190 d of gestation tended to be greater than fetuses at 135 and 240 d of gestation. The mRNA expression of TGF-β in fetuses at 190 d of gestation was greater than in fetuses at 135 d of gestation (P = 0.03), and the values observed in fetuses at 240 d of gestation did not differ from the other gestational time points. The least value of collagen content (P = 0.01) was observed in fetuses at 135 d of gestation, and no differences were observed among the other gestational time points. These data shows that maternal overnutrition enhances fibrogenesis and likely adipogenesis without compromising myogenesis in fetal skeletal muscle of cattle.((PMID:24703953))The discreteness of cell fates is an inherent and fundamental feature of multicellular organisms. Here we show that cross-antagonistic mechanisms of actions of MyoD and PPARγ, which are the master regulators of muscle and adipose differentiation, respectively, confer robustness to the integrity of cell differentiation. Simultaneous expression of MyoD and PPARγ in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells led to the generation of a mixture of multinucleated myotubes and lipid-filled adipocytes. Interestingly, hybrid cells (i.e., lipid-filled myotubes) were not generated, suggesting that these differentiation programs are mutually exclusive. Mechanistically, although exogenously expressed MyoD was rapidly degraded in adipocytes through ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, exogenously expressed PPARγ was not downregulated in myotubes. In PPARγ-expressing myotubes, PPARγ-dependent histone hyperacetylation was inhibited in a subset of adipogenic gene loci, including that of C/EBPα, an essential effector of PPARγ. Thus, the cross-repressive interactions between MyoD- and PPARγ-induced differentiation programs ensure discrete cell-fate decisions.((PMID:24621004))This study evaluated the effectiveness of local administration of cationic liposome-delivered myostatin-targeting siRNA. Myostatin (Mst)-siRNA and scrambled (scr)-siRNA-lipoplexes were injected into the masseter muscles of wild type and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, which model Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One week after injection, the masseter muscles were dissected for histometric analyses. To evaluate changes in masseter muscle activity, masseter electromyographic (EMG) measurements were performed. One week after local administration of Mst-siRNA-lipoplexes, masseter muscles and myofibrils were significantly larger compared to control masseter muscles treated with scr-siRNA-lipoplexes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses revealed significant upregulation of the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin and significant downregulation of the adipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEBPα) in masseter muscles treated with Mst-siRNA-lipoplexes. The duty times of masseter muscle activity exceeding 5% showed a slight tendency to increase in both wild type and mdx mice. Therefore, cationic liposome-mediated local administration of Mst-siRNA could increase muscular size and improve muscle activity. Since cationic liposomes delivered siRNA to muscles effectively and are safe and cost-effective, they may represent a therapeutic tool for use in treating muscular diseases.((PMID:24391766))Uncoupling protein (UCP) 3 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein implicated in lipid handling and metabolism of reactive oxygen species. Its transcription is mainly regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), a family of nuclear hormone receptors. Employing bandshift assays, RNA interference and reporter gene assays we examine an intronic region in the UCP3 gene harboring a cis-element essential for expression in brown adipocytes. We demonstrate binding of SP1 and SP3 to this element which is adjacent to a direct repeat 1 element mediating activation of UCP3 expression by PPARγ agonists. Transactivation mediated by these elements is interdependent and indispensable for UCP3 expression. Systematic deletion uncovered a third binding element, a putative NF1 site, in close proximity to the SP1/3 and PPARγ binding elements. Data mining demonstrated binding of MyoD and Myogenin to this third element in C2C12 cells, and, furthermore, revealed recruitment of p300. Taken together, this intronic region is the main enhancer driving UCP3 expression with SP1/3 and PPARγ as the core factors required for expression.((PMID:24036428))Tmod4 (Tropomodulin 4) is a member of Tmod family that plays important role in thin filament length regulation and myofibril assembly. We found that the expression levels of Tmod4 were higher in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. However, the function and regulation of the Tmod4 gene in the myogenesis and adipogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of Tmod4 was decreased in myogenesis while increased in adipogenesis. Then, the transcriptional regulation analysis of Tmod4 promoter showed that Tmod4 could be regulated directly by myogenic factors and adipogenic factors. Furthermore, the roles of Tmod4 in the myogenesis and adipogenesis were confirmed by its over-expression in C2C12 cells and 3T3 cells, which suggested that Tmod4 could promote adipogenesis by up-regulating the adipogenic factors but moderately delay the myogenesis. These results indicated that the Tmod4 gene may play as a switch between myogenesis and adipogenesis, which resulted in the balanced development between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, the model for switch role of the Tmod4 in the balanced regulation between myogenesis and adipogenesis was proposed. It is showed that the expression of Tmod4 was activated in adipogenesis by adipogenic factors while inhibited in myogenesis by myogenic factors. Moreover, Tmod4 could promote adipogenesis by up-regulating the expression of adipogenic factors while moderately delaying the myogenesis. Our study provides an important basis for further understanding the regulation and function of porcine Tmod4 in muscle and fat development.((PMID:23916784))Administration of β2-agonists triggers skeletal muscle anabolism and hypertrophy. We investigated the time course of the molecular events responsible for rat skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to 1, 3 and 10 days of formoterol administration (i.p. 2000μg/kg/day). A marked hypertrophy of rat tibialis anterior muscle culminated at day 10. Phosphorylation of Akt, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1 and ERK1/2 was increased at day 3, but returned to control level at day 10. This could lead to a transient increase in protein translation and could explain previous studies that reported increase in protein synthesis following β2-agonist administration. Formoterol administration was also associated with a significant reduction in MAFbx/atrogin-1 mRNA level (day 3), suggesting that formoterol can also affect protein degradation of MAFbx/atrogin1 targeted substrates, including MyoD and eukaryotic initiation factor-3f (eIF3-f). Surprisingly, mRNA level of autophagy-related genes, light chain 3 beta (LC3b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (Gabarapl1), as well as lysosomal hydrolases, cathepsin B and cathepsin L, was significantly and transiently increased after 1 and/or 3 days, suggesting that autophagosome formation would be increased in response to formoterol administration. However, this has to be relativized since the mRNA level of Unc-51-like kinase1 (Ulk1), BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein3 (Bnip3), and transcription factor EB (TFEB), as well as the protein content of Ulk1, Atg13, Atg5-Atg12 complex and p62/Sqstm1 remained unchanged or was even decreased in response to formoterol administration. These results demonstrate that the effects of formoterol are mediated, in part, through the activation of Akt-mTOR pathway and that other signaling pathways become more important in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass with chronic administration of β2-agonists.((PMID:23781298))Chronic inflammation induces skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia. In arthritic rats, fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα (PPARA)) agonist, reduces wasting of gastrocnemius, a predominantly glycolytic muscle, by decreasing atrogenes and myostatin. Considering that fenofibrate increases fatty acid oxidation, the aim of this study was to elucidate whether fenofibrate is able to prevent the effect of arthritis on serum adipokines and on soleus, a type I muscle in which oxidative metabolism is the dominant source of energy. Arthritis was induced by injection of Freund's adjuvant. Four days after the injection, control and arthritic rats were gavaged daily with fenofibrate (300 mg/kg bw) or vehicle over 12 days. Arthritis decreased serum leptin, adiponectin, and insulin (P<0.01) but not resistin levels. In arthritic rats, fenofibrate administration increased serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin. Arthritis decreased soleus weight, cross-sectional area, fiber size, and its Ppar α mRNA expression. In arthritic rats, fenofibrate increased soleus weight, fiber size, and Ppar α expression and prevented the increase in Murf1 mRNA. Fenofibrate decreased myostatin, whereas it increased MyoD (Myod1) and myogenin expressions in the soleus of control and arthritic rats. These data suggest that in oxidative muscle, fenofibrate treatment is able to prevent arthritis-induced muscle wasting by decreasing Murf1 and myostatin expression and also by increasing the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and myogenin. Taking into account the beneficial action of adiponectin on muscle wasting and the correlation between adiponectin and soleus mass, part of the anticachectic action of fenofibrate may be mediated through stimulation of adiponectin secretion.((PMID:23359523))Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy holds promise for treating diseases and tissue repair. Regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue that is lost during pathological muscle degeneration or after injuries is sustained by the production of new myofibers. Human Adipose stem cells (ASCs) have been reported to regenerate muscle fibers and reconstitute the pericytic cell pool after myogenic differentiation in vitro. Our aim was to evaluate the differentiation potential of constructs made from a new cross-linked hyaluronic acid (XHA) scaffold on which different sorted subpopulations of ASCs were loaded. Thirty days after engraftment in mice, we found that NG2(+) ASCs underwent a complete myogenic differentiation, fabricating a human skeletal muscle tissue, while NG2(-) ASCs merely formed a human adipose tissue. Myogenic differentiation was confirmed by the expression of MyoD, MF20, laminin, and lamin A/C by immunofluorescence and/or RT-PCR. In contrast, adipose differentiation was confirmed by the expression of adiponectin, Glut-4, and PPAR-γ. Both tissues formed expressed Class I HLA, confirming their human origin and excluding any contamination by murine cells. In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence that NG2(+) ASCs loaded on XHA scaffolds are able to fabricate a human skeletal muscle tissue in vivo without the need of a myogenic pre-differentiation step in vitro. We emphasize the translational significance of our findings for human skeletal muscle regeneration.((PMID:23006509))The self-healing potential of each tissue belongs to endogenous stem cells residing in the tissue; however, there are currently no reports mentioned for the isolation of human rotator cuff-derived mesenchymal stem cells (RC-MSCs) since. To isolate RC-MSCs, minced rotator cuff samples were first digested with enzymes and the single cell suspensions were seeded in plastic culture dishes. Twenty-four hours later, nonadherent cells were removed and the adherent cells were further cultured. The RC-MSCs had fibroblast-like morphology and were positive for the putative surface markers of MSCs, such as CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166, and negative for the putative markers of hematopoietic cells, such as CD34, CD45, and CD133. Similar to BM-MSCs, RC-MSCs were demonstrated to have the potential to undergo osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. Upon induction in the defined media, RC-MSCs also expressed lineage-specific genes, such as Runx 2 and osteocalcin in osteogenic induction, PPAR-γ and LPL in adipogenic differentiation, and aggrecan and Col2a1 in chondrogenic differentiation. The multipotent feature of RC-MSCs in the myogenic injury model was further strengthened by the increase in myogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo when compared with BM-MSCs. These results demonstrate the successful isolation of MSCs from human rotator cuffs and encourage the application of RC-MSCs in myogenic regeneration.((PMID:25101810))Foetal growth restriction impairs skeletal muscle development and adult muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. We hypothesized that key genes involved in muscle development and mitochondrial biogenesis would be altered following uteroplacental insufficiency in rat pups, and improving postnatal nutrition by cross-fostering would ameliorate these deficits. Bilateral uterine vessel ligation (Restricted) or sham (Control) surgery was performed on day 18 of gestation. Males and females were investigated at day 20 of gestation (E20), 1 (PN1), 7 (PN7) and 35 (PN35) days postnatally. A separate cohort of Control and Restricted pups were cross-fostered onto a different Control or Restricted mother and examined at PN7. In both sexes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), cytochrome c oxidase subunits 3 and 4 (COX III and IV) and myogenic regulatory factor 4 expression increased from late gestation to postnatal life, whereas mitochondrial transcription factor A, myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), myogenin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) decreased. Foetal growth restriction increased MyoD mRNA in females at PN7, whereas in males IGF-I mRNA was higher at E20 and PN1. Cross-fostering Restricted pups onto a Control mother significantly increased COX III mRNA in males and COX IV mRNA in both sexes above controls with little effect on other genes. Developmental age appears to be a major factor regulating skeletal muscle mitochondrial and developmental genes, with growth restriction and cross-fostering having only subtle effects. It therefore appears that reductions in adult mitochondrial biogenesis markers likely develop after weaning.((PMID:22160830))Myostatin (MSTN) is primarily expressed in muscle and plays an important role in muscle and fat development in pigs. However, there is little information about the regulation of pig MSTN. In order to elucidate whether pig MSTN could be regulated by muscle- and fat-related factors, the porcine MSTN promoter was amplified and cloned into pGL3-basic vector, and transfected into cells to analyze the transcriptional activity of promoter with muscle- and fat-related factors through dual-luciferase reporter assays. 5'-deletion expression showed that there was a negative-regulatory region located between nucleotides -1519 and -1236 bp, and there were some positive-regulatory regions located between -1236 and -568 bp. The longest fragment (1.7 kb) was cotransfected with muscle-related transcription factor myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD), resulting in promoter transcriptional activity upregulation. The fragment was treated by the adipogenic agents (DIM) including dexamethasone, insulin, and isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). We found that MSTN promoter transcriptional activity can be regulated by IBMX, but not by DIM. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) α and C/EBPβ, two proteins which are induced by DIM during adipogenesis were cotransfected with the 1.7-kb fragment, respectively, resulting in promoter transcriptional activity downregulation. Treating the fragment with rosiglitazone which induce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), resulting in promoter transcriptional activity upregulation. Cotransfection experiments confirmed this result. Taken together, we showed that porcine MSTN could be upregulated by IBMX, MyoD, and PPARγ but downregulated by C/EBPα and C/EBPβ.((PMID:21304067))Arthritis is a chronic inflammatory illness that induces cachexia, which has a direct impact on morbidity and mortality. Fenofibrate, a selective PPARα activator prescribed to treat human dyslipidemia, has been reported to decrease inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether fenofibrate is able to ameliorate skeletal muscle wasting in adjuvant-induced arthritis, an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis. On day 4 after adjuvant injection, control and arthritic rats were treated with 300 mg/kg fenofibrate until day 15, when all rats were euthanized. Fenofibrate decreased external signs of arthritis and liver TNFα and blocked arthritis-induced decreased in PPARα expression in the gastrocnemius muscle. Arthritis decreased gastrocnemius weight, which results from a decrease in cross-section area and myofiber size, whereas fenofibrate administration to arthritic rats attenuated the decrease in both gastrocnemius weight and fast myofiber size. Fenofibrate treatment prevented arthritis-induced increase in atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression in the gastrocnemius. Neither arthritis nor fenofibrate administration modify Akt-FoxO3 signaling. Myostatin expression was not modified by arthritis, but fenofibrate decreased myostatin expression in the gastrocnemius of arthritic rats. Arthritis increased muscle expression of MyoD, PCNA, and myogenin in the rats treated with vehicle but not in those treated with fenofibrate. The results indicate that, in experimental arthritis, fenofibrate decreases skeletal muscle atrophy through inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and myostatin.((PMID:20668686))Understanding fate choice and fate switching between the osteoblast lineage (ObL) and adipocyte lineage (AdL) is important to understand both the developmental inter-relationships between osteoblasts and adipocytes and the impact of changes in fate allocation between the two lineages in normal aging and certain diseases. The goal of this study was to determine when during lineage progression ObL cells are susceptible to an AdL fate switch by activation of endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma.Multiple rat calvaria cells within the ObL developmental hierarchy were isolated by either fractionation on the basis of expression of alkaline phosphatase or retrospective identification of single cell-derived colonies, and treated with BRL-49653 (BRL), a synthetic ligand for PPARgamma. About 30% of the total single cell-derived colonies expressed adipogenic potential (defined cytochemically) when BRL was present. Profiling of ObL and AdL markers by qRT-PCR on amplified cRNA from over 160 colonies revealed that BRL-dependent adipogenic potential correlated with endogenous PPARgamma mRNA levels. Unexpectedly, a significant subset of relatively mature ObL cells exhibited osteo-adipogenic bipotentiality. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed that ObL cells co-expressed multiple mesenchymal lineage determinants (runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), PPARgamma, Sox9 and MyoD which localized in the cytoplasm initially, and only Runx2 translocated to the nucleus during ObL progression. Notably, however, some cells exhibited both PPARgamma and Runx2 nuclear labeling with concomitant upregulation of expression of their target genes with BRL treatment.We conclude that not only immature but a subset of relatively mature ObL cells characterized by relatively high levels of endogenous PPARgamma expression can be switched to the AdL. The fact that some ObL cells maintain capacity for adipogenic fate selection even at relatively mature developmental stages implies an unexpected plasticity with important implications in normal and pathological bone development.((PMID:20471959))Brown adipocytes and myocytes develop from a common adipomyocyte precursor. PPARalpha is a nuclear receptor important for lipid and glucose metabolism. It has been suggested that in brown adipose tissue, PPARalpha represses the expression of muscle-associated genes, in this way potentially acting to determine cell fate in brown adipocytes. To further understand the possible role of PPARalpha in these processes, we measured expression of muscle-associated genes in brown adipose tissue and brown adipocytes from PPARalpha-ablated mice, including structural genes (Mylpf, Tpm2, Myl3 and MyHC), regulatory genes (myogenin, Myf5 and MyoD) and a myomir (miR-206). However, in our hands, the expression of these genes was not influenced by the presence or absence of PPARalpha, nor by the PPARalpha activator Wy-14,643. Similarly, the expression of genes common for mature brown adipocyte and myocytes (Tbx15, Meox2) were not affected. However, the brown adipocyte-specific regulatory genes Zic1, Lhx8 and Prdm16 were affected by PPARalpha. Thus, it would not seem that PPARalpha represses muscle-associated genes, but PPARalpha may still play a role in the regulation of the bifurcation of the adipomyocyte precursor into a brown adipocyte or myocyte phenotype.((PMID:19850007))Menopause, the age-related loss of ovarian hormone production, promotes increased adiposity and associated metabolic pathology, but molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that estrogen increases skeletal muscle PPARdelta expression in vivo, and transgenic mice overexpressing muscle-specific PPARdelta are reportedly protected from diet-induced obesity. We thus hypothesized that obesity observed in ovariectomized mice, a model of menopause, may result in part from abrogated expression of muscle PPARdelta and/or downstream mediators such as FoxO1. To test this hypothesis, we ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-ovariectomized (SHM) 10-week old female C57Bl/6J mice, and subsequently harvested quadriceps muscles 12weeks later for gene expression studies. Compared to SHM, muscle from OVX mice displayed significantly decreased expression of PPARdelta (3.4-fold), FoxO1 (4.5-fold), PDK-4 (2.3-fold), and UCP-2 (1.8-fold). Consistent with studies indicating PPARdelta and FoxO1 regulate muscle fiber type, we observed dramatic OVX-specific decreases in slow isoforms of the contractile proteins myosin light chain (11.1-fold) and troponin C (11.8-fold). In addition, muscles from OVX mice expressed 57% less myogenin (drives type I fiber formation), 2-fold more MyoD (drives type II fiber formation), and 1.6-fold less musclin (produced exclusively by type II fibers) than SHM, collectively suggesting a shift towards less type I oxidative fibers. Finally, and consistent with changes in PPARdelta and FoxO1 activity, we observed decreased expression of atrogin-1 (2.3-fold) and MuRF-1 (1.9-fold) in OVX mice. In conclusion, muscles from ovariectomized mice display decreased PPARdelta and FoxO1 expression, abrogated expression of downstream targets involved in lipid and protein metabolism, and gene expression profiles indicating less type I oxidative fibers.((PMID:25483038))Overexpression of SIRT1 is frequently observed in various types of cancers, suggesting its potential role in malignancies. However, the molecular basis of how SIRT1 is elevated in cancer is less understood. Here we show that cancer-related SIRT1 overexpression is due to evasion of Sirt1 mRNA from repression by a group of Sirt1-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) that might be robustly silenced in cancer. Our comprehensive library-based screening and subsequent miRNA gene profiling revealed a housekeeping gene-like broad expression pattern and strong CpG island-association of the Sirt1-targeting miRNA genes. This suggests aberrant CpG DNA methylation as the mechanistic background for malignant SIRT1 elevation. Our work also provides an example where epigenetic mechanisms cause the group-wide regulation of miRNAs sharing a common key target.((PMID:19625612))Stimulation of the mouse hindlimb via the sciatic nerve was performed for a 4-h period to investigate acute muscle gene activation in a model of muscle phenotype conversion. Initial force production (1.6 +/- 0.1 g/g body wt) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon study completion. An immediate-early growth response was present in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (FOS, JUN, activating transcription factor 3, and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene) with a similar but attenuated pattern in the soleus muscle. Transcript profiles showed decreased fast fiber-specific mRNA (myosin heavy chains 2A and 2B, fast troponins T(3) and I, alpha-tropomyosin, muscle creatine kinase, and parvalbumin) and increased slow transcripts (myosin heavy chain-1beta/slow, troponin C slow, and tropomyosin 3y) in the EDL versus soleus muscles. Histological analysis of the EDL revealed glycogen depletion without inflammatory cell infiltration in stimulated versus control muscles, whereas ultrastructural analysis showed no evidence of myofiber damage after stimulation. Multiple fiber type-specific transcription factors (tea domain family member 1, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha and -beta, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha) increased in the EDL along with transcription factors characteristic of embryogenesis (Kruppel-like factor 4; SRY box containing 17; transcription factor 15; PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 1; and embryonic lethal, abnormal vision). No established in vivo satellite cell markers or genes activated in our parallel experiments of satellite cell proliferation in vitro (cyclins A(2), B(2), C, and E(1) and MyoD) were differentially increased in the stimulated muscles. These results indicated that the molecular onset of fast to slow phenotype conversion occurred in the EDL within 4 h of stimulation without injury or satellite cell recruitment. This conversion was associated with the expression of phenotype-specific transcription factors from resident fiber myonuclei, including the activation of nascent developmental transcriptional programs.((PMID:19383623))Uncoupling protein 3 (Ucp3) is a transport protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane and presumably is implicated in the maintenance or tolerance of high lipid oxidation rates. Ucp3 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue and is regulated by a transcription factor complex involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, MyoD, and COUP transcription factor II. By analysis of a mutant Djungarian hamster model lacking Ucp3 transcription specifically in brown adipose tissue, we identified a putative transcription factor-binding site that confers tissue specificity. A naturally occurring intronic point mutation disrupting this site leads to brown adipose tissue-specific loss of Ucp3 expression and an altered body weight trajectory. Our findings provide insight into tissue-specific Ucp3 regulation and, for the first time, unambiguously demonstrate that changes in Ucp3 expression can interfere with body weight regulation.((PMID:19103298))Lactoferrin accelerates bone formation, but the precise cellular mechanism behind this is still unclear. We examined the effect of lactoferrin on the differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells using a typical pluripotent mesenchymal cell line, C2C12. Cells were cultured in low-mitogen differentiation medium to induce cell differentiation, with or without the addition of lactoferrin. The cell lineage was determined by alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity, mRNA expression of cellular phenotype-specific markers using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and protein synthesis using Western blotting. The expression of low-density lipoprotein lipase receptor-related proteins (LRPs) 1 and 2, both lactoferrin receptors, was determined by reverse transcription-PCR. ALPase activity increased after the addition of lactoferrin. The mRNA expression of Runx2, osteocalcin, and Sox9 increased markedly as a result of lactoferrin treatment, whereas the expression of MyoD, desmin, and PPARgamma decreased significantly. Western blots showed that lactoferrin stimulation increased Runx2 and Sox9 proteins, whereas it decreased MyoD and PPARgamma synthesis. C2C12 cells expressed the LRP1 lactoferrin receptor. These results indicate that lactoferrin treatment converts the differentiation pathway of C2C12 cells into the osteoblastic and chondroblastic lineage.((PMID:18616389))Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are bone marrow stromal progenitor cells that can differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic lineages. Several signaling pathways have been shown to regulate the lineage commitment and terminal differentiation of MSCs. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 14 types of bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs) for their abilities to regulate multilineage specific differentiation of MSCs. We found that most BMPs exhibited distinct abilities to regulate the expression of Runx2, Sox9, MyoD, and PPARgamma2. Further analysis indicated that BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, and BMP-9 effectively induced both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. BMP-induced commitment to osteogenic or adipogenic lineage was shown to be mutually exclusive. Overexpression of Runx2 enhanced BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation, whereas knockdown of Runx2 expression diminished BMP-induced bone formation with a decrease in adipocyte accumulation in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of PPARgamma2 not only promoted adipogenic differentiation, but also enhanced osteogenic differentiation upon BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 stimulation. Conversely, MSCs with PPARgamma2 knockdown or mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PPARgamma2(-/-) mice exhibited a marked decrease in adipogenic differentiation, coupled with reduced osteogenic differentiation and diminished mineralization upon BMP-9 stimulation, suggesting that PPARgamma2 may play a role in BMP-induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Thus, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism behind BMP-regulated lineage divergence during MSC differentiation, as this knowledge could help us to understand the pathogenesis of skeletal diseases and may lead to the development of strategies for regenerative medicine.((PMID:18042665))Women exhibit an enhanced capability for lipid metabolism during endurance exercise compared with men. The underlying regulatory mechanisms behind this sex-related difference are not well understood but may comprise signaling through a myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) regulatory pathway. The primary purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the protein signaling of MEF2 regulatory pathway components at rest and during 90 min of bicycling exercise at 60% Vo(2peak) in healthy, moderately trained men (n = 8) and women (n = 9) to elucidate the potential role of these proteins in substrate utilization during exercise. A secondary purpose was to screen for mRNA expression of MEF2 isoforms and myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) family members of transcription factors at rest and during exercise. Muscle biopsies were obtained before and immediately after exercise. Nuclear AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha (alphaAMPK) Thr(172) (P < 0.001), histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) Ser(498) (P < 0.001), and MEF2 Thr (P < 0.01) phosphorylation increased with exercise. No significant sex differences were observed at rest or during exercise. At rest, no significant sex differences were observed in mRNA expression of the measured transcription factors. mRNA for transcription factors MyoD, myogenin, MRF4, MEF2A, MEF2C, MEF2D, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) were significantly upregulated by exercise. Of these, MEF2A mRNA increased 25% specifically in women (P < 0.05), whereas MEF2D mRNA tended to increase in men (P = 0.11). Although minor sex differences in mRNA expression were observed, the main finding of the present study was the implication of a joint signaling action of AMPK, HDAC5, and PGC1alpha on MEF2 in the immediate regulatory response to endurance exercise. This signaling response was independent of sex.((PMID:17982260))The importance of connexins is implicated in proliferation and differentiation of cells. In skeletal muscle cells, connexin43 (Cx43) has been identified as the major connexin, and gap-junctional communication mediated by connexins has been shown to be required for their myogenic differentiation. In addition, inhibition of connexin function has been shown to induce transdifferentiation of osteoblasts to an adipocytic phenotype. In the present study, we examined whether the inhibition of connexin function could induce phenotypic changes in skeletal muscle cells. Treatment of skeletal muscle cells with an inhibitor of connexin function, 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGRA), resulted in a reduction in the number of MyoD-positive cells and complete inhibition of myotube formation, concomitantly with an increase in the number of C/EBPalpha-positive cells. AGRA-treated cells cultured in adipogenic differentiation medium could give rise to mature adipocytes that express both PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha. The presence of AGRA during adipogenic differentiation did not inhibit adipogenesis of skeletal muscle cells. AGRA treatment did not affect Cx43 expression in skeletal muscle cells but reduced its phosphorylation. These results indicate that inhibition of connexin function induces phenotypic changes of skeletal muscle cells to enter adipogenesis.((PMID:17959027))To investigate the effects of the wingless-related MMTV integration site 3A (Wnt3a) signaling on the proliferation, migration, and the myogenic and adipogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rMSC).Primary MSC were isolated and cultured from Sprague-Dawley rats and characterized by flow cytometry. Mouse L cells were transfected with Wnt3a cDNA, and conditioned media containing active Wnt3a proteins were prepared. Cell proliferation was evaluated by cell count and 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay. The migration of rMSC was performed by using a transwell migration and wound healing assay. The myogenic and adipogenic differentiation in rMSC were examined by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR at different time points after myogenic or adipogenic introduction.Wnt3a signaling induced beta-catenin nuclear translocation and activated the Wnt pathway in rMSC. In the presence of Wnt3a, rMSC proliferated more rapidly than the control cells, keeping their differentiation potential. Moreover, Wnt3a signaling induced 2.62% and 3.76% of rMSC-expressed desmin and myosin heavy chain after being cultured in myogenic medium. The myogenic differentiation genes, including Pax7, MyoD, Myf5, Myf4, and myogenin, were activated after Wnt3a treatment. On the other hand, Wnt3a inhibited the adipogenic differentiation in rMSC through the downregulated expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Furthermore, Wnt3a promoted the migration capacity of rMSC.The results indicate that Wnt3a signaling can induce myogenic differentiation in rMSC. Wnt3a signaling is also involved in the regulation of the proliferation and migration of rMSC. These results could provide a rational foundation for cell-based tissue repair in humans.((PMID:21040371))Muscle fibres have different properties with respect to force, contraction speed, endurance, oxidative/glycolytic capacity etc. Although adult muscle fibres are normally post-mitotic with little turnover of cells, the physiological properties of the pre-existing fibres can be changed in the adult animal upon changes in usage such as after exercise. The signal to change is mainly conveyed by alterations in the patterns of nerve-evoked electrical activity, and is to a large extent due to switches in the expression of genes. Thus, an excitation-transcription coupling must exist. It is suggested that changes in nerve-evoked muscle activity lead to a variety of activity correlates such as increases in free intracellular Ca(2+) levels caused by influx across the cell membrane and/or release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum, concentrations of metabolites such as lipids and ADP, hypoxia and mechanical stress. Such correlates are detected by sensors such as protein kinase C (PKC), calmodulin, AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ), and oxygen dependent prolyl hydroxylases that trigger intracellular signaling cascades. These complex cascades involve several transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), myogenic differentiation factor (myoD), myogenin, PPARδ, and sine oculis homeobox 1/eyes absent 1 (Six1/Eya1). These factors might act indirectly by inducing gene products that act back on the cascade, or as ultimate transcription factors binding to and transactivating/repressing genes for the fast and slow isoforms of various contractile proteins and of metabolic enzymes. The determination of size and force is even more complex as this involves not only intracellular signaling within the muscle fibres, but also muscle stem cells called satellite cells. Intercellular signaling substances such as myostatin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) seem to act in a paracrine fashion. Induction of hypertrophy is accompanied by the satellite cells fusing to myofibres and thereby increasing the capacity for protein synthesis. These extra nuclei seem to remain part of the fibre even during subsequent atrophy as a form of muscle memory facilitating retraining. In addition to changes in myonuclear number during hypertrophy, changes in muscle fibre size seem to be caused by alterations in transcription, translation (per nucleus) and protein degradation.((PMID:17065218))Coping with reduced energy sources entails drastic morphological and functional changes in skeletal muscle, but the sequence of events required classification. We found that gastrocnemius muscle from food-deprived rats shows acute rises in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator (PGC) -1alpha/PPAR delta nuclear protein and myosin heavy chain (MHC) Ib protein, while type I fibers accumulate and the muscle tissue appears redder. AMP levels, phosphorylation of both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream target acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) are induced within 6 h. Rapidly increased MyoD mRNA levels are followed by an increase in uncoupling protein (UCP) 3 (UCP3) transcription. Increased serum fatty acid levels coincide with increases in mitochondrial UCP3 protein levels and fatty acid oxidation. Accompanying this is a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation, reversible upon nicotinic acid treatment, indicating that fatty acids may modulate this kinase's activity after the metabolic challenges posed by food deprivation.((PMID:11477074))The effects of distinct classes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands on myogenesis and MyoD gene expression were examined in mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 myoblasts. Treatment of C2C12 cells with the PPARgamma ligand, 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), repressed morphologically defined myogenesis and reduced endogenous mRNA levels of the myogenic differentiation markers MyoD, myogenin, and alpha-actin. In contrast, two synthetic PPARgamma ligands, L-805645 and ciglitazone, exhibited no effects. In transient transfection assays, 15d-PGJ2 specifically inhibited the expression of a MyoD promoter-luciferase reporter gene (MyoDLuc) in a cell type- and promoter-specific manner, indicating that 15d-PGJ2 functions in part by repressing MyoD gene transcription. The inhibition of MyoD gene expression by 15d-PGJ2 is mediated by the distal region of the MyoD gene promoter. PPARgamma on its own also inhibited MyoDLuc expression and further augmented the 15d-PGJ2 response. In contrast, L-805645 and ciglitazone did not inhibit MyoDLuc expression on their own but did so in the presence of ectopically expressed PPARgamma. Interestingly, a transdominant inhibitor of PPARgamma (hPPARgamma2Delta500) had no effect on the 15d-PGJ2-dependent repression of MyoDLuc expression but overcame L-805645/PPARgamma-dependent repression. Finally, saturating concentrations of L-805645, which did not affect myogenesis, failed to ablate 15d-PGJ2-mediated repression of the myogenic program. Thus, distinct PPARgamma ligands may repress MyoD gene expression through PPARgamma-dependent and -independent pathways, and 15d-PGJ2 can inhibit the myogenic program independent of its cognate receptor, PPARgamma.((PMID:25167885))Tissue engineering (TE) strategies aim at imitating the natural process of regeneration by using bioresorbable scaffolds that support cellular attachment, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Based on the idea of combining a fully degradable polymer [poly(ɛ-caprolactone)] with a thermoresponsive polymer (polyethylene glycol methacrylate), a scaffold was developed, which liquefies below 20°C and solidifies at 37°C. In this study, this scaffold was evaluated for its ability to support C2C12 cells and human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to generate an expandable three-dimensional (3D) construct for soft or bone TE. As a first step, biomaterial seeding was optimized and cellular attachment, survival, distribution, and persistence within the 3D material were characterized. C2C12 cells were differentiated toward the osteogenic as well as myogenic lineage, while ASCs were cultured in control, adipogenic, or osteogenic differentiation media. Differentiation was examined using quantitative real-time PCR for the expression of osteogenic, myogenic, and adipogenic markers and by enzyme activity and immunoassays. Both cell types attached and were found evenly distributed within the material. C2C12 cells and ASCs demonstrated the potential to differentiate in all tested lineages under 2D conditions. Under 3D osteogenic conditions for C2C12 cells, only osteocalcin expression (fold induction: 16.3±0.2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (p<0.001) were increased compared with the control C2C12 cells. Three-dimensional osteogenic differentiation of ASC was limited and donor dependent. Only one donor showed an increase in the osteogenic markers osteocalcin (p=0.027) and osteopontin (p=0.038). In contrast, differentiation toward the myogenic or adipogenic lineage showed expression of specific markers in 3D, at least at the level of the 2D culture. In 3D culture, strong induction of myogenin (p<0.001) as well as myoD (p<0.001) was found in C2C12 cells. The adipogenic differentiation of one donor showed greater expression of peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) (p=0.004), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) (p=0.008), and adiponectin (p=0.045) in 3D compared with 2D culture. Leptin levels in the supernatant of the ASC cultures were elevated in the 3D cultures in both donors at day 14 and 21. In conclusion, the thermoresponsive scaffold was found suitable for 3D in vitro differentiation toward soft tissue.((PMID:26944559))Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a key transcription factor in adipogenesis and can be regulated by adipogenesis-related factors. However, little information is available regarding its regulation by myogenic factors. In this study, we found that over-expression of MyoD enhanced porcine adipocyte differentiation and up-regulated PPARγ expression, whereas small interfering RNA against MyoD significantly attenuated porcine adipocyte differentiation and inhibited PPARγ expression. The MyoD-binding sites in the PPARγ promoter region at -412 to -396 and -155 to -150 were identified by promoter deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation further showed that these two regions are MyoD-binding sites, both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that MyoD directly interacts with the porcine PPARγ promoter. Thus, our results demonstrate that an Enhancer box and a binding site for a cooperative co-activator of MyoD are present in the promoter region of porcine PPARγ; furthermore, MyoD up-regulates PPARγ expression and promotes porcine adipocyte differentiation.((PMID:23449382))Maternal obesity is linked with offspring obesity and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle (SM) insulin resistance is central to the development of diabetes. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is inhibited in SM of fetuses born to obese mothers.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal metformin administration on AMPK activity and reversion of adverse changes in offspring SM of obese mice.Female weanling C57BL/6J mice received either control diet (CON, 6 mice) or high-fat diet (HFD; OB, 12 mice) for 8 weeks before mating. After mating, mice continued receiving their respective CON or OB diets. In addition, 6 of those 12 mice fed with fat diet also received metformin administration (2 mg per ml in drinking water) throughout gestation and lactation (MET). After weaning at postnatal 21 days, offspring were fed a HFD to mimic a postnatal obesogenic environment until necropsy.Mothers receiving the fat diet developed obesity. OB offspring showed higher adiposity than CON and MET offspring. AMPK phosphorylation was lower in SM of OB offspring. β-Catenin and myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and myogenin, were downregulated in OB muscle, whereas the adipogenic marker, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, was upregulated compared with CON muscle. Metformin administration prevented these changes in OB offspring SM. OB but not MET offspring demonstrated glucose intolerance. Mitochondrial content decreased, and activities of citrate synthase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase also decreased in OB offspring SM, whereas they were recovered in MET offspring SM.Maternal metformin administration improves SM development in OB offspring.((PMID:19834648))Our current understanding of muscle and adipose tissue development has been largely restricted to the study of murine myogenic and adipogenic cell lines, since attempts to establish these cell lines from other species have met with only limited success. Here we report that a spontaneously immortalized bovine embryonic fibroblast cell line (BEFS) undergoes differentiation into adipogenic or myogenic lineages when ectopically transduced with PPARgamma2 (an adipogenic lineage determinant) or MyoD (a myogenic lineage determinant) and grown in adipogenic and myogenic differentiation culture media (ADCM and MDCM, respectively). We also found that PPARgamma2-overexpressing BEFS cells (BEFS-PPARgamma2) grown in ADCM with or without the PPARgamma2 ligand, troglitazone, preferentially differentiate into adipogenic cells in the presence of ectopic MyoD expression. Ectopic expression of PPARgamma2 in the inducible MyoD-overepxressing BEFS cells (BEFS-TetOn-MyoD) completely suppresses myogenic differentiation and leads to a significant increase in adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that the adipogenic differentiation program might be dominant. Therefore, BEFS, BEFS-PPARgamma2, and BEFS-TetOn-MyoD would be a valuable biological model for understanding a fundamental principle underlying myogenic and adipogenic development, and for isolating various genetic and chemical factors that enable muscle and adipocyte differentiation.((PMID:27012163))Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that represent a promising source for regenerative medicine. MSCs are capable of osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic differentiation. Efficacy of differentiated MSCs to regenerate cells in the injured tissues requires the ability to maintain the differentiation toward the desired cell fate. Since MSCs represent an attractive source for autologous transplantation, cellular and molecular signaling pathways and micro-environmental changes have been studied in order to understand the role of cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors on the differentiation of MSCs. The differentiation of MSC into a mesenchymal lineage is genetically manipulated and promoted by specific transcription factors associated with a particular cell lineage. Recent studies have explored the integration of transcription factors, including Runx2, Sox9, PPARγ, MyoD, GATA4, and GATA6 in the differentiation of MSCs. Therefore, the overexpression of a single transcription factor in MSCs may promote trans-differentiation into specific cell lineage, which can be used for treatment of some diseases. In this review, we critically discussed and evaluated the role of transcription factors and related signaling pathways that affect the differentiation of MSCs toward adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes, skeletal muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and smooth muscle cells.((PMID:26345871))Intramuscular fat (IMF) or intramuscular triglycerides are interspersed throughout the skeletal muscles. The IMF, also called marbling, imparts meat with flavor and juiciness and is one of the core criteria for judging carcass value. The quantity of IMF is influenced entirely by genetics. Recently, understanding the underlying genetic bases of IMF has been a focus particularly in the beef industry. In this study, with the deep insights of ameliorating the beef quality by genetic means, the role of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) gene was investigated by over-expressing C/EBPα in bovine muscle stem cells (MSCs) to initiate the adipogenic program. Prior to this, bovine MSCs were isolated and induced to differentiate into adipocytes from cells that were exposed to dexamethasone isobutylmethylxanthine and indomethacin; the presence of insulin and fetal bovine serum was examined. Either ectopic expression of C/EBPα or treatment with dexamethasone and insulin induced the accumulation of fat droplets and the expression of adipogenic induction genes (LPL, PPARγ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ). The expression levels of myoblast-related genes (MyoD, Myf5, and Pax7) were also measured to assess the accuracy of the differentiation process. This study provides evidence that the C/EBPα gene is essential for cattle adipose tissue growth and development. Hence, this finding can contribute to improving beef carcass quality.((PMID:26164089))Chemerin is an adipocyte-secreted adipokine that regulates the differentiation and metabolism of adipose through auto-/paracrine signaling. Its function in the differentiation of multipotent myoblast cells has thus far received little attention. In this study, C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured in the medium with Chemerin, and the differentiation potential of C2C12 myoblasts was analyzed. The results showed that Chemerin increased ROS levels and TG content of C2C12 cells. At the same time, the mRNA expressions and protein concentrations of the adipogenic factors PPARγ, C/EBPα and UCP1 were up-regulated, while the muscle specific transcription factors MyoD, Myogenin and MyHC were decreased in cultured C2C12 cells. In conclusion, the adipokine Chemerin promoted the adipogenic differentiation potential and altered the fate of myoblast cells from myogenesis to adipogenesis, which contributed in part to the up-regulated adipocyte genes. Our study reveals the importance of functional Chemerin signaling in adipogenesis and in directing the differentiation of multipotent myoblast cells.((PMID:26071185))The positive regulatory domain containing 16 (PRDM16) is commonly regarded as a "switch" controlling the transdifferentiation of myoblasts to brown adipocytes. The N-positive regulatory (PR) domain, which is highly homologous to SET domain, is a characteristic structure for the PRDM family. Many SET domain containing proteins and several PRDM members have been found to possess histone methyltransferase activity, yet the role of PRDM16 and its PR domain in the epigenetic regulation of myogenic and adipogenic genes during myoblasts/adipocytes transdifferentiation remains unexplored. In this study, we transfected C2C12 myoblasts to stably express PRDM16 and observed the repression of myogenic genes and activation of adipogenic genes at both proliferation and differentiation stages. Ectopic PRDM16-induced reprogramming of myogenic and adipogenic genes was associated with the hypermethylation on some CpG sites in the enhancer or promoter of MyoD and myogenin, but the methylation status of PPARγ promoter was not affected. C2C12 cells expressing truncated PRDM16 lacking PR domain (ΔPR-PRDM16) demonstrated attenuation of both adipogenic and myogenic potentials, indicated by PPARγ inactivation and decreased triglyceride deposition, as well as a downregulation of MyoD, MyHC and MCK genes, as compared with C2C12 cells expressing intact PRDM16. Furthermore, C2C12 cells expressing ΔPR-PRDM16 exhibited significant differences in histone modifications on the promoters of MyoD and PPARγ genes. Taken together, PRDM16-induced C2C12 transdifferentiation is associated with alterations in CpG methylation of myogenic factors, and PR domain affects both myogenesis and adipogenesis with modified histone methylation marks on MyoD and PPARγ promoters.((PMID:24691879))The present experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of coculturing on myogenic and adipogenic marker gene expressions with the use of C2C12 and 3 T3-L1 preadipocyte cells under the coculture system. C2C12 and 3 T3-L1 cells were cocultured using transwell inserts with a 0.4-μm porous membrane to separate C2C12 and 3 T3-L1 cells. Each cell type was grown independently on the transwell plates. Following cell differentiation, inserts containing 3 T3-L1 cells were transferred to C2C12 plates, and inserts containing C2C12 cells were transferred to 3 T3-L1 plates. After coculture of the C2C12 and 3 T3-L1 cells for 48 and 72 h, the cells in the lower well were harvested for analysis, and this process was carried out for both cells. Myogenic markers such as myogenin, MyoD, Myf5, PAX3, and PAX7 mRNA expressions were analyzed in the cocultured C2C12 cells. Adipogenic markers such as fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBPA), adiponectin, lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions were analyzed in the cocultured 3 T3-L1 cells. Myogenic and adipogenic marker gene mRNA expressions were significantly altered in the cocultured C2C12 and 3 T3-L1 cells when compared with the monocultured C2C12 and 3 T3-L1 cells.((PMID:24579311))Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells which can differentiate into several distinct lineages, such as chondrocytes, adipocytes and myofibers. It has been reported that the lineage-specific transcriptional factors including Runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and Myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) may play key regulatory roles among the differentiation of MSCs. Recently, researches have confirmed that the Hippo pathway impacts the differentiation fates of MSCs through regulating the activity of line- age-specific transcription factors by the Hippo pathway effectors Tafazzin (TAZ) and/or Yes-associated protein (YAP). The interaction between TAZ and RUNX2 boosts the osteogenic processes and promotes MSCs differentiating into osteoblast lineage. However, PPARgamma binding to TAZ may inhibit the adipocytes differentiation, and thus overexpression of TAZ in mesenchymal stem cell-like cells increases the expression of myogenic genes and hastens myofiber formation through a MyoD-dependent manner. Moreover, other signaling pathways (such as BMP-2, TNF-alpha, Eph-Ephrin, etc.), small molecules (KR62980, TM-25659, etc.), and mechanistic stimuli can also affect the fate by regulating the activity of TAZ/YAP. In this review, we summarized the signaling pattern of Hippo pathway and the function mechanism of TAZ and/or YAP by enumerating their interaction to several lineage-specific transcriptional factors and relationship with other signal pathways during MSCs differentiation.((PMID:25229314))Muscle development in domesticated animals is important for meat production. Furthermore, intramuscular fat content is an important trait of meat intended for consumption. Here, we examined differences in the expression of factors related to myogenesis, adipogenesis and skeletal muscle growth during fetal muscle development of lean (Yorkshire) and obese (Chenghua) pig breeds. At prenatal days 50 (d50) and 90 (d90), muscles and sera were collected from pig fetuses. Histology revealed larger diameters and numbers of myofibers in Chenghua pig fetuses than those in Yorkshire pig fetuses at d50 and d90. Yorkshire fetuses had higher serum concentrations of myostatin (d90), a negative regulator for muscle development, and higher mRNA expression of the growth hormone receptor Ghr (d90), myogenic MyoG (d90) and adipogenic LPL (d50). By contrast, Chenghua fetuses exhibited higher serum concentration of growth hormone (d90), and higher mRNA expression of myogenic MyoD (d90) as well as adipogenic PPARG and FABP4 (d50). Our results revealed distinct expression patterns in the two pig breeds at each developmental stage before birth. Compared with Chenghua pigs, development and maturation of fetal skeletal muscles may occur earlier in Yorkshire pigs, but the negative regulatory effects of myostatin may suppress muscle development at the later stage.((PMID:23581542))Periodontal ligament (PDL) cells in stationary two-dimensional culture systems are in a double default state. Our aim therefore was to engineer and characterize three-dimensional constructs, by seeding PDL cells into hyaluronan-gelatin hydrogel films (80-100 μm) in a format capable of being mechanically deformed.Human PDL constructs were cultured with and without connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 in (i) stationary cultures, and (ii) mechanically active cultures subjected to cyclic strains of 12% at 0.2 Hz each min, 6 h/d, in a Flexercell FX-4000 Strain Unit. The following parameters were measured: cell number and viability by laser scanning confocal microscopy; cell proliferation with the MTS assay; the expression of a panel of 18 genes using real-time RT-PCR; matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1-3, TIMP-1, CTGF and FGF-2 protein levels in supernatants from mechanically activated cultures with Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Constructs from stationary cultures were also examined by scanning electron microscopy and immunostained for actin and vinculin.Although initially randomly distributed, the cells became organized into a bilayer by day 7; apoptotic cells remained constant at approximately 5% of the total. CTGF/FGF-2 stimulated cell proliferation in stationary cultures, but relative quantity values suggested modest effects on gene expression. Two transcription factors (RUNX2 and PPARG), two collagens (COL1A1, COL3A1), four MMPs (MMP-1-3, TIMP-1), TGFB1, RANKL, OPG and P4HB were detected by gel electrophoresis and Ct values < 35. In mechanically active cultures, with the exception of P4HB, TGFB1 and RANKL, each was upregulated at some point in the time scale, as was the synthesis of MMPs and TIMP-1. SOX9, MYOD, SP7, BMP2, BGLAP or COL2A1 were not detected in either stationary or mechanically active cultures.Three-dimensional tissue constructs provide additional complexity to monolayer culture systems, and suggest some of the assumptions regarding cell growth, differentiation and matrix turnover based on two-dimensional cultures may not apply to cells in three-dimensional matrices. Primarily developed as a transitional in vitro model for studying cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in tooth support, the system is also suitable for investigating the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases, and importantly from the clinical point of view, in a mechanically active environment.((PMID:19261834))We assessed the developmental ability of embryos cloned from porcine neural stem (NS) cells, amniotic fluid-derived stem (AFS) cells, fetal fibroblast cells, adult fibroblast, and mammary gland epithelial cells. The five cell lines were transfected with enhanced green fluorescence protein gene respectively using lipofection. NS and AFS cells were induced to differentiate in vitro. Stem cells and their differentiated cells were harvested for analysis of the markers using RT-PCR. The five cell lines were used for nuclear transfer. The two-cell stage-cloned embryos derived from each cell line were transferred into the oviducts of surrogate mothers. The results showed that both NS and AFS cells expressed POU5F1, THY1 and SOX2, and they were both induced to differentiate into astrocyte (GFAP+), oligodendrocyte (GalC+), neuron (NF+, ENO2+, and MAP2+), adipocyte (LPL+ and PPARG-D+), osteoblast (osteonectin+ and osteocalcin+), myocyte (MYF6+ and MYOD+), and endothelium (PECAM1+, CD34+, CDH5+, and NOS3+) respectively. Seven cloned fetuses (28 days and 32 days) derived from stem cells were obtained. The in vitro developmental ability (morula-blastocyst rate was 28.26-30.07%) and in vivo developmental ability (pregnancy rate were 1.67-2.17%) of the embryos cloned from stem cells were higher (P<0.05) than that of the embryos cloned from somatic cells (morula-blastocyst rate was 16.27-19.28% and pregnancy rate was 0.00%), which suggests that the undifferentiated state of the donor cells increases cloning efficiency.((PMID:27673705))Agastache rugosa (Fisch. & C. A. Mey.) Kuntze has been well known for its antioxidative properties. In this study, we investigated the antimelanogenesis effect of demethyleugenol β-D-glucopyranoside (1) from Agastache rugosa by studying molecular regulation of melanogenesis in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) and in in vivo models. The SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome)-related high-mobility group (HMG) box 9 (SOX9), one of critical factors that affect skin pigmentation is up-regulated. Interestingly, 1 downregulated the expression of SOX9 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Reduction of these two transcription factors resulted in a decrease in melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1, and dopachrome tautomerase. As a result, 1 significantly inhibited the melanin synthesis in melan-a mouse melanocytes and NHEMs. In addition, the antimelanogenic effect of 1 was confirmed in the zebrafish and reconstructed skin tissue models. In conclusion, 1, as a potent SOX9 regulator ameliorates skin pigmentation.((PMID:27663623))The cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12) has been implicated as a potent stimulator of tissue degradation in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis. In patients with periodontitis, an increased level of IL-12 is found in serum and gingival crevicular fluid. As inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated to induce activation of the immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), this study aimed to investigate the influence of IL-12 on these properties in human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells.Human PDL cells were isolated from periodontal tissue and incubated with 0-10 ng/mL of IL-12 for 24 h. The levels of expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), as well as of the stem cell markers, CD73, CD90 and CD105, were assessed by quantitative PCR. The level of IFN-γ protein was measured by ELISA, and IDO activity was measured by activity assay. The participation of IFN-γ in the expression of IDO and HLA-G was analyzed using neutralizing antibody against IFN-γ.IL-12 upregulated the expression of IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-12 induced the expression of the immunomodulatory proteins IDO and HLA-G via an IFN-γ-dependent pathway, as indicated by experiments using an IFN-γ neutralizing antibody. Addition of exogenous IFN-γ upregulated the expression of HLA-G and IDO. Expression of the stem cell markers CD73, CD90 and CD105, as well as the pluripotent markers Nanog homeobox, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY-box 2, were also upregulated in IL-12-treated hPDL cells. Finally, IL-12 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of the hPDL cells and preserved the self-clonal expansion property of these cells, as assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and the colony-forming unit assay.Expression of IL-12 during periodontitis may play an important role in the control of the inflammatory response via the induction of immunosuppressive molecules by hPDL cells. We hypothesize that this immunomodulatory property of IL-12 will serve as a protective mechanism to preserve a population of stem cells under inflammatory conditions.((PMID:27656215))Purpose. To track the fate of micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) labeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo in a rat myocardial infarction model using 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Materials and Methods. Male MSCs (2 × 10(6)/50 μL) dual-labeled with MPIO and CM-DiI were injected into the infarct periphery 7 days after myocardial infarction (MI). The control group received cell-free media injection. The temporal stem cell location, signal intensity, and cardiac function were dynamically assessed using a 7T MRI at 24 h before transplantation (baseline), 3 days, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after transplantation, respectively. Results. MR hypointensities caused by MPIOs were observed on T2(⁎)-weighted images at all time points after MSCs injection. Cine-MRI showed that MSCs moderated progressive left ventricular remodeling. Double staining for iron and CD68 revealed that most of the iron-positive cells were CD68-positive macrophages. Real-time PCR for rat SRY gene showed the number of survival MSCs considerably decreased after transplantation. MSC-treated hearts had significantly increased capillary density in peri-infarct region and lower cardiomyocytes apoptosis and fibrosis formation. Conclusions. Iron particles are not a reliable marker for in vivo tracking the long-term fate of MSCs engraftment. Despite of poor cell retention, MSCs moderate left ventricular remodeling after MI.((PMID:27654689))Accurate mouse sexing is vital when conducting research examining sexual dimorphisms. Late fetal and newborn mouse pups are more immature than many previously described sexing methods allow. This study compares the sexing accuracy of a newly described internal gonad sexing method to a recently described peritoneal pigmentation sexing method in embryonic day 20 C57BL/6J mouse pups, using Sry genotyping to confirm the sex. The internal gonad sexing method was found to be highly accurate, while the peritoneal pigmentation method was slightly less accurate. Therefore, while Sry genotyping remains the gold standard, immediate and less expensive sexing methods can be performed accurately as early as the late fetal period in C57BL/6J mice.((PMID:27648416))In Algeria, the data on infertility and its various causes are rare. Recently, the introduction of assisted reproduction has allowed expecting that 300000 couples, which represent 7% of couples of reproductive age, face difficulty conceiving a child. Knowing that most idiopathic cases are likely to be due to chromosomal abnormalities, we aimed to investigate genetic defects by karyotype analysis in Algerian infertile men, using peripheral blood lymphocytes.A cytogenetic study was conducted on 10 men from infertile couples by Karyotype analysis of R-banding performed by lymphocyte culture technique. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed and molecular abnormalities were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were evaluated by immunoradiometric method.Chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 30% of the patients. We identified a homogenous Klinefelter syndrome patient with 47, XXY karyotype, a mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patient with 47, XXY/46, XY karyotype and a 46, XX male. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the sex-determining region Y was translocated to the short arm of the X chromosome in patient with 46, XX chromosomal constitution and the presence of the SRY gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis.The occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities in 30% of the infertile men strongly supports the inclusion of routine cytogenetic testing for diagnostic establishment and suitable counseling for couples seeking for assisted reproduction technologies.((PMID:27644460))Lissencephaly is one of the central nervous system anomalies of Miller-Dieker Syndrome (MDS). Fetuses with lissencephaly have an abnormal smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves which will be detected by ultrasounds or fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 30 weeks of gestation. We report a fetus with lissencephaly diagnosed as Miller-Dieker syndrome postnatally. G banded chromosome analysis revelaed 45,X,psu dic(17;Y)(p13;p11.32).ish dic (17;Y)(LIS1-,RARA+, SRY+, DYZ3+) by G-banding analysis using high resolution banding technique. Fetal delayed cortical development will be the findings to perform further investigations including FISH analysis for MDS, a 17p13.3 microdeletion syndrome, pre/postnatally. This will be the first case of MDS with unbalanced translocation between deleted short arm of chromosome 17 and Y chromosome.((PMID:27643851))Macaca fascicularis fascicularis is distributed over a wide area of Southeast Asia. Thailand is located at the center of their distribution range and is the bridge connecting the two biogeographic regions of Indochina and Sunda. However, only a few genetic studies have explored the macaques in this region. To shed some light on the evolutionary history of M. f. fascicularis, including hybridization with M. mulatta, M. f. fascicularis and M. mulatta samples of known origins throughout Thailand and the vicinity were analyzed by molecular phylogenetics using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including the hypervariable region 1, and Y-chromosomal DNA, including SRY and TSPY genes. The mtDNA phylogenetic analysis divided M. f. fascicularis into five subclades (Insular Indonesia, Sundaic Thai Gulf, Vietnam, Sundaic Andaman sea coast, and Indochina) and revealed genetic differentiation between the two sides of the Thai peninsula, which had previously been reported as a single group of Malay peninsular macaques. From the estimated divergence time of the Sundaic Andaman sea coast subclade, it is proposed that after M. f. fascicularis dispersed throughout Southeast Asia, some populations on the south-easternmost Indochina (eastern Thailand, southern Cambodia and southern Vietnam at the present time) migrated south-westwards across the land bridge, which was exposed during the glacial period of the late Pleistocene epoch, to the southernmost Thailand/northern peninsular Malaysia. Then, some of them migrated north and south to colonize the Thai Andaman sea coast and northern Sumatra, respectively. The SRY-TSPY phylogenetic analysis suggested that male-mediated gene flow from M. mulatta southward to M. f. fascicularis was restricted south of, but close to, the Isthmus of Kra. There was a strong impact of the geographical factors in Thailand, such as the Isthmus of Kra, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Phuket ranges and Sundaland, on M. f. fascicularis biogeography and their hybridization with M. mulatta.((PMID:27641728))The aim of the present study was to prove that primary cells enriched with stem cells are more easily reprogrammed to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells than those with scarce numbers of stem cells.We surveyed the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in five primarily-isolated human deciduous teeth-derived dental pulp cells (HDDPC) with cytochemical staining to examine the possible presence of stem cells. Next, the expression of stemness-specific factors, such as OCT(Octumer-binding transcription factor)3/4, NANOG, SOX2(SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2), CD90, muscle segment homeodomain homeobox (MSX) 1, and MSX2, was assessed with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Finally, these isolated HDDPC were transfected with plasmids carrying genes coding Yamanaka factors to determine whether these cells could be reprogrammed to generate iPS cells.Of the five primarily-isolated HDDPC, two (HDDPC-1 and -5) exhibited higher degrees of ALP activity. OCT-3/4 expression was also prominent in those two lines. Furthermore, these two lines proliferated faster than the other three lines. The transfection of HDDPC with Yamanaka factors resulted in the generation of iPS cells from HDDPC-1 and -5.The number of cells with the stemness property of HDDPC differs among individuals, which suggests that HDDPC showing an increased expression of both ALP and OCT-3/4 can be more easily reprogrammed to generate iPS cells after the forced expression of reprogramming factors.((PMID:27638301))Histone acetylation regulated by class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a pivotal role in matrix-specific gene transcription and cartilage development. While we previously demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-455-3p is upregulated during chondrogenesis and can enhance early chondrogenesis, the mechanism underlying this process remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the effect of miR-455-3p on histone H3 acetylation and its role during cartilage development and degeneration. We observed that miR-455-3p was highly expressed in proliferating and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, while HDAC2 and HDAC8 were primarily expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Meanwhile, miR-455-3p suppressed the activity of reporter constructs containing the 3'-untranslated regions of HDAC2/8, inhibited HDAC2/8 expression and promoted histone H3 acetylation at the collagen 2 (COL2A1) promoter in human SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in increased expression of cartilage-specific genes and promoted glycosaminoglycan deposition. Moreover, TSA inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) expression and promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 in interleukin-1-treated primary mouse chondrocytes. Lastly, knockdown of HDAC2/3/8 increased SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9) and decreased Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-455-3p plays a critical role during chondrogenesis by directly targeting HDAC2/8 and promoting histone H3 acetylation, which raises possibilities of using miR-455-3p to influence chondrogenesis and cartilage degeneration.((PMID:27635402))Objectives. To investigate whether high glucose-induced oxidative stress is implicated in apoptosis of rat nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and abnormal expression of critical genes involved in the metabolic balance of extracellular matrix (ECM). Methods. NPCs were cultured with various concentrations of glucose to detect cell viability and apoptosis. Cells cultured with high glucose (25 mM) were untreated or pretreated with N-acetylcysteine or a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated. Activation of p38 MAPK was measured by Western blot. The expression of ECM metabolism-related genes, including type II collagen, aggrecan, SRY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (Sox-9), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Results. High glucose reduced viability of NPCs and induced apoptosis. High glucose resulted in increased ROS generation and p38 MAPK activation. In addition, it negatively regulated the expression of type II collagen, aggrecan, Sox-9, and TIMP-1 and positively regulated MMP-3 expression. These results were changed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine or SB 202190. Conclusions. High glucose might promote apoptosis of NPCs, trigger ECM catabolic pathways, and inhibit its anabolic activities, possibly through a p38 MAPK-dependent oxidative stress mechanism.((PMID:27634221))SRY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (Sox9) gene is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation. In this study, we identified the transcriptional factor ZNF606 as an interacting partner for Sox9 in cells. We further demonstrated that overexpression of ZNF606 inhibited the transcriptional activity of Sox9, while knockdown of ZNF606 increased Sox9-mediated transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ZNF606 prevents Sox9 binding to the enhancers of its target gene col2a1. Importantly, the interaction between ZNF606 and Sox9 was decreased during chondrocyte differentiation. Consistent with these findings, ZNF606 inhibited chondrocyte differentiation. Thus, our results demonstrate that ZNF606 acts as a novel Sox9 co-regulator that inhibits Sox9-mediated chondrocyte differentiation.((PMID:27627724))To establish a rabbit model for investigating the effects of intermittent cyclic mechanical tension (ICMT) on promoting degeneration of endplate cartilage.Forty New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to surgery and randomly divided into three equal groups as follows: control group (no treatment, n = 10), sham group (animals underwent a sham operation but were not subjected to mechanical tensile strain, n = 15) and loaded group (discs were subjected to 1.5 MPa external tensile loading by using an external loading device during the animals' daily activity, n = 15). Mechanical tensile strain was applied for 8 h/d. The animals were examined radiologically after 8 weeks treatment and then killed for removal of endplate cartilage tissue samples from their spines. Histological staining was performed to examine the morphology of endplate cartilage tissue. Multiple strategies were employed to examine degeneration of endplate cartilage and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway activation.After ICMT loading for 56 days, radiology revealed ossification, hyperosteogeny and stenosis in the intervertebral spaces. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin staining of sections of endplate cartilage showed significant damage as the load duration increased in the ICMT loading group. Expression of aggrecan (ACAN), type II collagen (COL-2A), SRY-related high mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX9) was down-regulated (FACAN = 21.515, P < 0.01; FCOL-2A = 6.670, P = 0.05; FSOX9 = 7.888, P < 0.05), whereas that of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) was up-regulated (FMMP13 = 14.120, P < 0.01) after ICMT. Western blot and immunofluorescence revealed that expression of protein was consistent with gene expression results. Additionally, ICMT loading can lead to NF-κB signaling pathway activation as well as degeneration of endplate cartilage.These experiments indicate that ICMT contributes to the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and that the NF-κB signaling pathway further up-regulates MMP13, leading to degeneration of endplate cartilage.((PMID:27611865))Selenium toxicity to oviparous vertebrates is often attributed to selenomethionine (SeMet), which can biomagnify through maternal transfer. Although oxidative stress is implicated in SeMet toxicity, knowledge gaps remain in how SeMet causes characteristic spinal deformities. In the present study, we use the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) model to investigate the role of oxidative stress, cell death, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) on skeletal gene expression and SeMet toxicity, linking localization of cellular effects to observed abnormalities. Medaka embryos were treated with 2.5μM or 5μM SeMet for 24h at stage 25 (48h post fertilization). Post treatment, embryos were separated into normal, deformed (mild, moderate or severe), or dead categories. Dichlorofluorescein staining demonstrated oxidative stress in tails of embryos with observable spinal malformations. Furthermore, acridine orange staining for apoptosis identified significantly more dead cells in tails of treated embryos. Gene expression studies for the UPR suggest a potential role for CHOP (c/ebp homologous protein) induced apoptosis deformed embryos after 5μM SeMet, accompanied by a significant decrease in PDIA4 (protein disulfide isomerase A4) and no change in Dnajb9 (ER DNA J Domain-Containing Protein 4). This expression was distinct from the UPR induced by well-studied ER stress inducer, tunicamycin, which robustly activated CHOP, PDIA4 and Dnajb9. Finally, SeMet treatment significantly decreased transcripts of cartilage development, Sox9 (SRY box 9), while increasing Runx2 in deformed embryos, without altering Twist or Collagen 2a1. Results suggest that oxidative stress, the UPR and cell death play key roles in SeMet induced deformities and altered skeletal development factors.((PMID:27611740))The sex-determining gene SRY induces SOX9 expression in the testes of eutherian mammals via two pathways. SRY binds to testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 (TESCO) with SF1 to activate SOX9 transcription. SRY also up-regulates ER71 expression, and ER71 activates Sox9 transcription. After the initiation of testis differentiation, SOX9 enhances Amh expression by binding to its promoter with SF1. SOX8, SOX9 and SOX10, members of the SOXE gene family, also enhance the activities of the Amh promoter and TESCO. In this study, we investigated the regulation of these sexual differentiation genes in Tokudaia osimensis, which lacks a Y chromosome and the SRY gene. The activity of the AMH promoter was stimulated by SOXE genes and SF1. Mutant AMH promoters, with mutations in its SOX and SF1 binding sites, did not show significant activity by SOX9 and SF1. These results indicate that AMH expression was regulated by the binding of SOX9 and SF1. By contrast, SOXE genes could not enhance TESCO activity. These results indicate that TESCO enhancer activity was lost in this species. Furthermore, the activity of the SOX9 promoter was enhanced by ER71, indicating that ER71 may play an important role in the testis-specific expression of SOX9.((PMID:27604691))In a 46 XY individual, the presence of the Y chromosome harboring the testis-determining factor (SRY) triggers testis determination and differentiation. In a 46 XX individual, the absence of SRY and the activation of genes associated with the female pathway lead to ovarian development. The latter process has long been considered as a default pathway. However, recent studies have cast doubts on this dogma. Here, after a brief overview of the main steps of ovarian development, we focus on three genes WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 that are essential for ovarian determination, differentiation and/or maintenance. Special attention is paid to FOXL2 whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis syndrome, often associated with female infertility, and for cancer. We highlight the cooperation of WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 within a regulatory network and the need for further research to better understand their role in defining and maintaining ovarian identity.((PMID:27592376))A novel color-tunable phosphor Sr3Y(PO4)3:Ce(3+),Tb(3+) was synthesized through solid-state reaction method. Several techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, were used to investigate the obtained phosphors. Results of luminescence spectra and decay time measurements revealed that an efficient energy transfer occurred from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) via a dipole-dipole mechanism, where Ce(3+) exhibited a strong excitation band in the near-ultraviolet region. CIE chromaticity coordinates were tuned from deep blue (0.162, 0.090) to green (0.230, 0.411) by adjusting the relative concentrations between Ce(3+) and Tb(3+) ions. Results revealed that the as-synthesized phosphors had color-tunable characteristics and can be used as promising materials in the field of phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes.((PMID:27588041))Constitutional translocations between sex chromosomes are rather rare in humans with breakpoints at Xp11 and Yq11 as the most frequent. Breakpoints on the short arm of the Y chromosome form one subgroup of t(X;Y), giving rise to a derived chromosome with the centromeres of both the X and Y chromosomes, dic(X;Y). Here, we report a rare congenital chromosomal aberration, 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32)[20]/45,X[10], in an adult male.Primary myelofibrosis, a malignant haematological disease, was diagnosed in a 63-year-old man following liver transplantation after hepatocellular carcinoma. By the analysis of the bone marrow sample, the karyotype 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32) was detected in all the mitoses analysed and verified with multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH). A cytogenetic examination of stimulated peripheral blood cells revealed the constitutional karyotype 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32)[20]/45,X[10]. The cell line 45,X was confirmed with FISH in 35 % of interphase nuclei. The SRY locus was present on the dicentric chromosome. A CGH/SNP array (Illumina) revealed a gain of 153,7 Mbp of the X chromosome and a 803-kbp microdeletion (including the SHOX gene), which were also confirmed with FISH. SHOX encodes a transcriptional factor that regulates the growth of the long bones. The deletion of the SHOX gene together with the Madelung deformity of the forearm and the short stature of the proband led to a diagnosis of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD). The gain of almost the whole X chromosome (153,7 Mbp) was considered a variant of Klinefelter syndrome (KS). The levels of gonadotropins and testosterone were consistent with gonadal dysfunction. A malformation of the right external ear was detected.We have reported a structural aberration of the sex chromosomes, dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32). The related genomic imbalance is associated with two known hereditary syndromes, LWD and a KS variant, identified in our proband at an advanced age. Because the breakpoints did not involve cancer genes, we inferred that the two malignancies in the proband were not caused by this abnormality. The possible influence of SHOX haploinsufficiency on the growth regulation of auricular chondrocytes is discussed.((PMID:27578009))Tissue engineering-based therapies rely on the delivery of monolayered fibroblasts on two-dimensional polystyrene-coated and extracellular matrix (ECM) surfaces to regenerate connective tissues. However, this approach may fail to mimic their three-dimensional (3D) native architecture and function. We hypothesize that ECM fibrous proteins, which direct the migration of cells in vivo, may attach and guide polystyrene- and Matrigel™-ECM (M-ECM)-adherent fibroblasts to rearrangement into large multicellular macrostructures with the ability to proliferate. Gingival monolayered fibroblasts and their derived spheroids were added and adhered to tissue culture polystyrene and M-ECM surfaces. The cells were covered with a layer of collagen1 hydrogel combined with vitronectin, fibronectin or fibrin, or 10% M-ECM. The development of 3D cell constructs was characterized by epifluorescence and confocal scanning microscope image analysis. The ECM turnover and the proliferative capabilities of the fibroblasts were determined via gene expression profiling of collagen1, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase/metallopeptidase 2, Nanog, and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box2 (Sox2). Expression of the Sox2 protein was followed by immunostaining. The collagen1 protein had the strongest effect on monolayered and spheroid cell rearrangements, forming large spherical shapes and fused 3D macroconstructs. The addition of fibrin protein was typically required to achieve a similar effect on M-ECM-adherent monolayered fibroblasts. The spheroid fusion process was followed by an increase in cell density and the formation of tight clusters. The fused spheroids continued to maintain their intracellular ECM turnover and proliferation capacities. Collagen1 is a valuable component in the rearrangement of adherent fibroblast monolayers and spheroids. Fibroblast spheroids should preferably be used as basic building blocks to assemble multicellular connective tissue-like macrostructures.((PMID:27576690))A general problem is posed by analysis of transcriptional thresholds governing cell-fate decisions in metazoan development. A model is provided by testis determination in therian mammals. Its key step-Sertoli-cell differentiation in the embryonic gonadal ridge-is initiated by SRY, a Y-encoded architectural transcription factor. Mutations in human SRY cause gonadal dysgenesis leading to XY female development (Swyer syndrome). Here, we have characterized an inherited mutation compatible with either male or female somatic phenotypes as respectively observed in an XY father and XY daughter. The mutation (a crevice-forming substitution at a conserved back surface of the SRY high-mobility-group box) markedly destabilizes the domain but preserves specific DNA affinity and induced DNA bend angle. On transient transfection of diverse human and rodent cell lines, the variant SRY exhibited accelerated proteasomal degradation (relative to wild-type) associated with increased ubiquitination; in vitro susceptibility to ubiquitin-independent (″default″) cleavage by the 20S core proteasome was unchanged. The variant's gene-regulatory activity (as assessed in a cellular model of the rat embryonic XY gonadal ridge) was reduced by twofold relative to wild-type SRY at similar levels of mRNA expression. Chemical proteasome inhibition restored native-like SRY expression and transcriptional activity in association with restored occupancy of a sex-specific enhancer element in principal downstream gene Sox9, demonstrating that the variant SRY exhibits essentially native activity on a per-molecule basis. Our findings define a novel mechanism of impaired organogenesis: accelerated ubiquitin-directed proteasomal degradation of a master transcription factor leading to a developmental decision poised at the edge of ambiguity.((PMID:27563746))In this commentary we briefly summarize early work on circular RNAs derived from spliceosome mediated circularization. We highlight how this early work inspired work on the basic mechanisms of nuclear RNA splicing, the possible function of circular RNAs and the potential uses of circular RNAs as tools in biomedicine. Recent developments in the study of circular RNAs, summarized in this volume, have brought these questions back to the foreground.((PMID:27536700))The SRY gene (SRY) provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In this study, SRY of 15 spices included of human, chimpanzee, dog, pig, rat, cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, horse, zebra, frog, urial, dolphin and killer whale were used for determine of bioinformatic differences.Nucleotide sequences of SRY were retrieved from the NCBI databank. Bioinformatic analysis of SRY is done by CLC Main Workbench version 5.5 and ClustalW (http:/www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and MEGA6 softwares.The multiple sequence alignment results indicated that SRY protein sequences from Orcinus orca (killer whale) and Tursiopsaduncus (dolphin) have least genetic distance of 0.33 in these 15 species and are 99.67% identical at the amino acid level. Homosapiens and Pantroglodytes (chimpanzee) have the next lowest genetic distance of 1.35 and are 98.65% identical at the amino acid level.These findings indicate that the SRY proteins are conserved in the 15 species, and their evolutionary relationships are similar.((PMID:27264816))To investigate the phenotype-genotype association of isodicentromere Y chromosome by analysis of two female patients carrying the chromosome with sexual development disorders.The karyotypes of the two patients were determined by application of conventional G banding of peripheral blood samples and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR was applied to detect the presence of SRY gene.Conventional karyotype analysis showed case 1 to be a mosaic: mos.45,X[38]/46,X,+mar[151]/47,XY,+mar[5]/47,X,+mar × 2[2]/46,XY[4], FISH showed that 12 different cell lines were presented in the karyotype of case 1 and partial cell lines with SRY gene, the marker is an isodicentromere Y chromosome [idic(Y)(p)]. No mutation was found in the SRY gene. The karyotype of case 2 was mos.45,X[25]/46,X,+mar[35]. FISH showed the marker to be an idic(Y)(p) without the SRY gene.The karyotype of patients carrying idic(Y)(p) seems unstable, and female patients have the characteristics of short stature and secondary sexual hypoplasia. Karyotype analysis combined with FISH analysis can accurately determine the breakpoint of idic(Y) and identify the types of complex mosaic, which may facilitate genetic counseling and prognosis.((PMID:26823431))The mammalian Y chromosome is considered a symbol of maleness, as it encodes a gene driving male sex determination, Sry, as well as a battery of other genes important for male reproduction. We previously demonstrated in the mouse that successful assisted reproduction can be achieved when the Y gene contribution is limited to only two genes, Sry and spermatogonial proliferation factor Eif2s3y. Here, we replaced Sry by transgenic activation of its downstream target Sox9, and Eif2s3y, by transgenic overexpression of its X chromosome-encoded homolog Eif2s3x. The resulting males with no Y chromosome genes produced haploid male gametes and sired offspring after assisted reproduction. Our findings support the existence of functional redundancy between the Y chromosome genes and their homologs encoded on other chromosomes.((PMID:26719889))Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process allowing for a formation of a mature male gamete. During its final phase, spermiogenesis, haploid round spermatids undergo cellular differentiation into spermatozoa, which involves extensive restructuring of cell morphology, DNA, and epigenome. Using mouse models with abrogated Y chromosome gene complements and Y-derived transgene we identified Y chromosome encoded Zfy2 as the gene responsible for sperm formation and function. In the presence of a Zfy2 transgene, mice lacking the Y chromosome and transgenic for two other Y-derived genes, Sry driving sex determination and Eif2s3y initiating spermatogenesis, are capable of producing sperm which when injected into the oocytes yield live offspring. Therefore, only three Y chromosome genes, Sry, Eif2s3y and Zfy2, constitute the minimum Y chromosome complement compatible with successful intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the mouse.((PMID:26672550))((PMID:26651950))Simple and precise methods for sex determination in animals are a pre-requisite for a number of applications in animal production and forensics. Some of the existing methods depend only on the detection of Y-chromosome specific sequences. However, the detection of Y and X-chromosome specific sequences is advantageous. In the present study the accuracy of sex determination by SRY (sex-determining region Y) and AMEL (Amelogenin) gene detection was assessed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of DNA extracted from free fetal cells in maternal blood, which is noninvasive for fetus and easier to collect. The PCR amplification of SRY primers produced a single band of 171bp from ewes bearing a male fetus, whereas no band was amplified from the DNA extracted from ewes pregnant to a female fetus. Moreover, two bands of 182 and 242bp in male and a single band of 242 in female fetuses were produced by AMEL gene primers in the PCR reaction. Using this technique 100% of samples were successfully sexed, excluding twins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that sex determination using DNA of free fetal cells in maternal plasma is efficient using both SRY and AMEL gene sequences. It also is evident that this method is not suitable for sex determination of twin pregnancies.((PMID:26617765))This study was initiated to investigate the efficacy of myocardial fibrosis intervention via signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling using bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in which being over-expressed with the aid of bispecific antibody (BiAb) and ultrasound-mediated microbubbles (MB). BiAb was prepared and combined with isolated MSC with CD47 overexpression from male mice and trans-fused into female mice with isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis via the tail vein, followed by MB. This study included five groups. Five weeks after treatment, expression levels of the sex-determining region of Y-chromosome (SRY), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in myocardium were detected by fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT 3 was detected by Western blot.The highest homing number of MSC was in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB group, second highest in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb group, and lowest in MSC alone. Compared with the Control group, CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB, CD47 + MSC + BiAb, CD47 + MSC and MSC groups had decreased levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, STAT 1 and collagen deposition, and increased levels of STAT 3. Up regulated STAT 3 and down regulated TIMP-1 were significantly different in CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB compared with CD47 + MSC or CD47 + MSC + BiAb.CD47 can enhance the homing rate and repairing efficacy of MSC. MSC can improve MMP-TIMP expression in injured myocardium and interfere with myocardial fibrosis after homing, a mechanism that may be related to the STAT-mediated signaling pathway.((PMID:26585458))This paper introduces a two-step cascade enrichment method for isolating nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in maternal blood. The two-step enrichment platform consists of a positive enrichment process based on a red blood cell (RBC) hyperaggregation method and a negative enrichment process using microfluidic technology. An analytical evaluation using blood samples from patients with leukemia showed that the while blood cell (WBC) depletion and NRBC loss rates of the positive enrichment process were 93.98 % and 6.02 %, respectively. Through the two-step cascade enrichment method, 1-396 NRBCs and only 0-6 WBCs were isolated from 1 mL of 18 maternal blood samples. Experimental results also showed that the WBC depletion rate of the proposed two-step method was more than 625,000-fold, and the purity of enriched NRBCs ranged from 20 % to 100 %. Furthermore, SRY (the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) genes were detected in enriched NRBCs, thereby demonstrating that enriched NRBCs contain fetus-derived NRBCs.((PMID:26582524))Gonadoblastoma (GB), a rare in situ germ cell tumor derived from sex cord and germ cells, is closely associated with gonadal dysgenesis. About 80% of GB individuals exhibit 46, XY female phenotype while the others are 45, XY and 46, XX with disorders of sex development. Moreover, 35% of GB can eventually develop into malignant tumors, such as seminoma and dysgerminoma tumors. The molecular genetic mechanism of GB remains to be fully uncovered due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Increasing studies show that the formation of GB is closely related to genes regulating sexual differentiation and determination (e.g., SRY, WT1, SOX9, Foxl2, TSPY, etc), and is affected by the interaction of genetic and epigenetic regulation. Here we describe the clinical and pathological features, diagnosis and treatment of GB, and also summarize the molecular genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the gonadal abnormalities that lead to GB. We analyze and construct the common gene regulatory networks related to the development of GB, and describe some obstacles and deficiencies in current studies to provide innovative perspectives on further studying the pathological and molecular mechanisms of GB.((PMID:26444262))Sex determination in mammals requires expression of the Y-linked gene Sry in the bipotential genital ridges of the XY embryo. Even minor delay of the onset of Sry expression can result in XY sex reversal, highlighting the need for accurate gene regulation during sex determination. However, the location of critical regulatory elements remains unknown. Here, we analysed Sry flanking sequences across many species, using newly available genome sequences and computational tools, to better understand Sry's genomic context and to identify conserved regions predictive of functional roles.Flanking sequences from 17 species were analysed using both global and local sequence alignment methods. Multiple motif searches were employed to characterise common motifs in otherwise unconserved sequence.We identified position-specific conservation of binding motifs for multiple transcription factor families, including GATA binding factors and Oct/Sox dimers. In contrast with the landscape of extremely low sequence conservation around the Sry coding region, our analysis highlighted a strongly conserved interval of ~106 bp within the Sry promoter (which we term the Sry Proximal Conserved Interval, SPCI). We further report that inverted repeats flanking murine Sry are much larger than previously recognised.The unusually fast pace of sequence drift on the Y chromosome sharpens the likely functional significance of both the SPCI and the identified binding motifs, providing a basis for future studies of the role(s) of these elements in Sry regulation.((PMID:26418730))A single-born, 15-month-old Holstein cattle, diagnosed as hermaphrodite, was investigated for estrous cycle, hormonal profiles, karyotype, presence of SRY, as well as anatomopathological and histological aspects. Normal continuous estrous cycles and basal testosterone levels were reported. Necropsy showed the presence of a female genital tract that mismatched a vulvar opening and a male pelvic urethra continued within a penis. Moreover, we observed islands of seminiferous tubules with the presence of germline cells, 2 pampiniform plexi, the corpus cavernosum, the penile urethra, the corpus spongiosum and the glans. Cytogenetic analyses of the blood cells showed an XX karyotype, while the molecular analyses revealed the presence of the SRY gene in several tissues, including blood. This is the first report in the scientific literature of an SRY-positive hermaphrodite Holstein cattle with continuous ovarian cycles.((PMID:26401661))Gonadal sex in most mammals is determined based on sex differentiation of the supporting cell lineages. In mouse XY gonads, SRY induces SOX9 upregulation and subsequent FGF9 expression by embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), leading to the differentiation of Sertoli cells. XX gonads, lacking SRY action, start on the ovarian program through the actions of WNT4 and FOXL2 from around E11.5-12.0. These 2 ovarian factors, together with retinoic acid (RA) action, promote feminization partially through the repression of the masculinizing activities of SOX9, FGF9 and DMRT1. RA initiates meiosis in female germ cell cysts, in which intercellular bridges between interconnected germ cells rapidly undergo cyst breakdown by E17.5. Ovarian morphogenesis is characterized by continuous recruitment of pre-granulosa progenitor cells from the coelomic epithelia during the embryonic stage, which results in the formation of ovigerous cords and tight packing of non-interconnected oocytes (i.e. oocyte nests) at the perinatal stages. At birth, the oocyte nests break down into single oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells, leading to the assembly of primordial follicles. This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular and cellular events of initial ovarian differentiation, meiotic initiation, germ cell nest breakdown, and primordial follicle formation based on anatomical and morphogenetic aspects.((PMID:26219507))Animal researches and clinical studies have supported the relevance between phthalates exposure and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). These disorders may comprise common origin in fetal life, especially during sex determination and differentiation, where the mechanism remains unclear. The present study evaluated the disturbances in gene regulatory networks of sex determination in fetal mouse by in utero Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure. Temporal expression of key sex determination genes were examined during the critical narrow time window, using whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative-PCR. DEHP exposure resulted in significant reduction in mRNA of Sry during sex determination from gestation day (GD) 11.0 to 11.5 in male fetal mice, and the increasing of Sry expression to threshold level on GD 11.5 was delayed. Meanwhile, Gadd45g and Gata4, the upstream genes of Sry, and downstream gene Sox9 were also significantly downregulated in expression. In fetal females, the expression of Wnt4 and beta-catenin were up-regulated by DEHP exposure. Taken together, the results suggest that the potential mechanism of gonadal development disorder by DEHP may origin from repression of important male sex determination signaling pathway, involving Gadd45g → Gata4 → Sry → Sox9. The results would promote a better understanding of the association between phthalate esters (PAEs) exposure and the reductive disorder.((PMID:26184845))The SOX gene family includes many genes that play a determinant role in several developmental pathways. The SOX9 gene has been identified as a major factor in testis development in mammals after it is activated by the SRY gene. However, duplication of the gene itself in some mammalian species, or of a well-delimited upstream 'RevSex' region in humans, has been shown to result in testis development in the absence of the SRY gene. In the current study, we present an accurate analysis of the genomic organization of the SOX9 locus in dogs by both in silico and FISH approaches. Contrary to what is observed in the current dog genome assembly, we found that the genomic organization is quite similar to that reported in humans and other mammalian species, including the position of the RevSex region in respect to SOX9. The analysis of the conserved sequences within this region in 7 mammalian species facilitated the highlighting of a consensus sequence for SRY binding. This new information could help in the identification of evolutionarily conserved elements relevant for SOX9 gene regulation, and could provide valid targets for mutation analysis in XY DSD patients.((PMID:26121024))Diagnosis of fetal gender early in pregnancy is very useful as it would prevent invasive fetal sampling in almost half the cases at risk of inheriting X-linked disorders or those affecting sexual differentiation. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using circulating cell-free fetal (cff) DNA from maternal circulation has emerged as a useful alternative to existing methods for prenatal diagnosis of gender. NIPD eliminates the risk of miscarriage from invasive prenatal diagnosis and the necessity of possessing specialized obstetric skills for fetal tissue sampling. The aim of this study was to compare two Y chromosome markers-SRY and DYS14-for their utility in the diagnosis of fetal gender.Forty-eight plasma samples from pregnant women between 9 and 25 weeks of gestation were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on cff DNA extracted from maternal plasma to detect fetal Y chromosome with SRY (n=27) and DYS14 (n=48) markers.We observed 100% sensitivity and 85.6% specificity in noninvasive Y chromosome detection with the combined use of DYS14 and SRY markers (n=27) compared with the results obtained on using DYS14 (n=48 sensitivity 94%; specificity 71.4%) and SRY (n=27, sensitivity 84%; specificity 92.8%) markers alone.Our results show that the test performance improved with the employment of two Y-amplification assays.((PMID:26108792))Sex-reversal cases in humans and genetic models in mice have revealed that the fate of the bipotential gonad hinges upon the balance between pro-testis SOX9 and pro-ovary beta-catenin pathways. Our central query was: if SOX9 and beta-catenin define the gonad's identity, then what do the gonads become when both factors are absent? To answer this question, we developed mouse models that lack either Sox9, beta-catenin, or both in the somatic cells of the fetal gonads and examined the morphological outcomes and transcriptome profiles. In the absence of Sox9 and beta-catenin, both XX and XY gonads progressively lean toward the testis fate, indicating that expression of certain pro-testis genes requires the repression of the beta-catenin pathway, rather than a direct activation by SOX9. We also observed that XY double knockout gonads were more masculinized than their XX counterpart. To identify the genes responsible for the initial events of masculinization and to determine how the genetic context (XX vs. XY) affects this process, we compared the transcriptomes of Sox9/beta-catenin mutant gonads and found that early molecular changes underlying the XY-specific masculinization involve the expression of Sry and 21 SRY direct target genes, such as Sox8 and Cyp26b1. These results imply that when both Sox9 and beta-catenin are absent, Sry is capable of activating other pro-testis genes and drive testis differentiation. Our findings not only provide insight into the mechanism of sex determination, but also identify candidate genes that are potentially involved in disorders of sex development.((PMID:26083441))This report describes a disorder of the sexual development in a beagle dog resulting in an intersex condition. A 6 mo old beagle was presented for evaluation of a protruding structure from the vulva consistent with an enlarged clitoris. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of both gonadal and uterine structures. Retrograde cystourethrovaginogram showed the presence of an os clitoris and severe vaginal stenosis. Histological studies revealed the presence of bilateral ovotestes and uterus. The gonad had interstitial cells within seminiferous-like tubules lined only with Sertoli cells and abundant interstitial cells among primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. Hormone assays completed before and after gonadohysterectomy showed an elevation in the levels of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone that returned to baseline 3 mo after surgery. Testosterone levels that were within the male reference ranges before surgery decreased to basal levels postsurgically. 17-β-Estradiol levels showed little variation and values were always within the reference ranges for a male. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal female karyotype (2n = 78, XX) and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the absence of the sex-determining region Y gene. In summary, the dog presented bilateral ovotestes and a 2n = 78, XX chromosomal complement lacking the sex determining region Y gene, consistent with a diagnosis of true hermaphroditism.((PMID:26013162))The acquisition of stemness is a hallmark of aggressive human hepatocellular carcinoma (hHCC). The stem cell marker OCT4 is frequently expressed in HCCs, and its expression correlates with those of putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and CSC properties. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of CSC maintenance by SRY through OCT4. We previously reported that Sry is involved in tumor malignancy in rodent HCCs. However, the oncogenic function of SRY in hHCCs is poorly understood. Ectopic expression of SRY increased multiple stem cell factors, including OCT4 and CD13. The OCT4 promoter contained SRY-binding sites that were directly activated by SRY. In HCC-derived cells, SRY knockdown decreased OCT4 expression and cancer stem-like phenotypes such as self-renewal, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity. Conversely, OCT4 and SRY overexpression promoted cancer stem-like phenotypes. OCT4 knockdown in SRY clones downregulated the self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance. These data suggest that SRY is involved in the maintenance of cancer stem-like characteristics through OCT4. Moreover, CSCs of HCC-derived cells differentiated into Tuj1-positive neuron-like cells by retinoic acid. Noteworthily, SRY was highly expressed in some hHCC patients. Taken together, our findings imply a novel therapeutic strategy against CSCs of hHCCs.((PMID:20301589))Nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular disorders of sex development (46,XX testicular DSD) are characterized by the presence of a 46,XX karyotype; male external genitalia ranging from normal to ambiguous; two testicles; azoospermia; and absence of Müllerian structures. Approximately 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size, but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from azoospermia. Approximately 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present at birth with ambiguous genitalia. Gender role and gender identity are reported as male. If untreated, males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the consequences of testosterone deficiency.Diagnosis of nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD is based on the combination of clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing. Endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure. Cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX karyotype. SRY, the gene that encodes the sex-determining region Y protein, is the principal gene known to be associated with 46,XX testicular DSD. Approximately 80% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD are SRY positive as shown by use of FISH or chromosomal microarray (CMA). Rearrangements in or around SOX9 and SOX3 detected by CMA, or rarely karyotype, have recently been reported in a few cases; at least one more as-yet-unknown gene at another locus is implicated.Treatment of manifestations: Similar to that for other causes of testosterone deficiency. After age 14 years, low-dose testosterone therapy is initiated and gradually increased to reach adult levels. In affected individuals with short stature who are eligible for growth hormone therapy, testosterone therapy is either delayed or given at lower doses initially in order to maximize the growth potential. Reduction mammoplasty may need to be considered if gynecomastia remains an issue following testosterone replacement therapy. Treatment for osteopenia is by standard protocols. Providers are encouraged to anticipate the need for further psychological support. Surveillance: Monitor for testosterone effects during testosterone replacement therapy, including prostate size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in adults; routine monitoring of hematocrit, lipid profile, and liver function tests; bone mineral density determination by bone densitometry (DEXA) annually, if osteopenia has been diagnosed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contraindications to testosterone replacement therapy include prostate cancer (known or suspected) and breast cancer; oral androgens such as methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone should not be given because of liver toxicity.SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is generally not inherited because it results from de novo abnormal interchange between the Y chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in the presence of SRY on the X chromosome and infertility. When SRY is translocated to another chromosome or when fertility is preserved, sex-limited autosomal dominant inheritance is observed. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been documented for familial cases thought to be caused by CNV in or around SOX9. The mode of inheritance of other SRY-negative 46,XX testicular DSD is not known, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been postulated. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at risk for SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is possible.((PMID:25875750))((PMID:26046131))The RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38, also known as RNPC1) plays a pivotal role in regulating a wide range of biological processes, from cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest to cell myogenic differentiation. It was originally recognized as an oncogene, and was frequently found to be amplified in prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon carcinoma, esophageal cancer, dog lymphomas and breast cancer. In the present study, the complete RNPC1 gene was identified in a number of vertebrate genomes, suggesting that RNPC1 exists in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. In the different genomes, the gene had a similar 4 exon/3 intron organization, and all the genetic loci were syntenically conserved. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the RNPC1 gene from the mammalian, bird, reptile and teleost lineage formed a species-specific cluster. A total of 34 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 14 SNPs causing missense mutations, 8 exonic splicing enhancer SNPs and 12 SNPs causing nonsense mutations, were identified in the human RNPC1 gene. RNPC1 was found to be expressed in bladder, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian, skin and soft tissue cancer. In 14 of the 94 tests, an association between RNPC1 gene expression and cancer prognosis was observed. We found that the association between the expression of RNPC1 and prognosis varied in different types of cancer, and even in the same type of cancer from the different databases used. This suggests that the function of RNPC1 in these tumors may be multidimensional. The sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 5 (Sox5), runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), CCAAT displacement protein 1 (CUTL1), v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog (Rel)A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ isoform 2 (PPARγ2) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) regulatory transcription factor binding sites were identified in the upstream (promoter) region of the RNPC1 gene, and may thus be involved in the effects of RNPC1 in tumors.((PMID:22781928))Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) function as mitogens and morphogens during vertebrate development. In the present study, to characterise the regulatory mechanism of FGF8 gene expression in developing Xenopus embryos the upstream region of the Xenopus FGF8 (XFGF8) gene was isolated. The upstream region of the XFGF8 gene contains two putative binding sites for the SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) transcription factor. A reporter assay with serially deleted constructs revealed that the putative SOX2-binding motif may be a critical cis-element for XFGF8 gene activation in developing Xenopus embryos. Furthermore, Xenopus SOX2 (XSOX2) physically interacted with the SOX2-binding motif within the upstream region of the XFGF8 gene in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of endogenous XSOX2 resulted in loss of XFGF8 gene expression in midbrain-hindbrain junction, auditory placode, lens placode and forebrain in developing Xenopus embryos. Collectively, our results suggest that XSOX2 directly upregulates XFGF8 gene expression in the early embryonic development of Xenopus.((PMID:18579725))Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1 (NR5A1 previously known as SF-1/AD4BP) is a transcription factor involved in the development of adrenal/gonadal tissues and steroidogenic lineage cell differentiation in adult somatic stem cells. To understand the cellular signaling network that regulates NR5A1 gene expression, loss of function screening with an siRNA kinome library, and gain of function screening with an addressable full-length cDNA library representing one quarter of the human genome was carried out. The NR5A1 gene expression was activated in mesenchymal stem cells by siRNA directed against protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, erb-B3, RhoGAP (ARHGAP26), and hexokinase 2, none of which were previously known to be involved in the NR5A1 gene expression. Among these, we identified crosstalk between erb-B3 and PKC-delta signaling cascades. In addition, the gain of function studies indicated that sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 15 (SOX15), TEA domain family member 4, KIAA1257 (a gene of unknown function), ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 6, Josephin domain containing 1, centromere protein, TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 5-like RNA polymerase, and inducible T-cell co-stimulator activate NR5A1 gene expression. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of NR5A1 gene expression.((PMID:18156714))It is known that the Y chromosome or Y-specific sequence is present in about 6% of Turner syndrome (TS) patients and that it predisposes them to gonadoblastoma formation with an estimated risk of 15-25%. In this study, we performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 32 patients with TS to detect Y-specific sequence. The results were compared with those obtained by the fluorescence in situ hybridaization (FISH) method.Cytogenetic analysis was performed by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral lymphocyte cultures, using G-banding. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood for PCR. Seven different sets of oligonucleotide primers, sex determining region Y (SRY), zinc finger gene on the Y chromosome (ZFY), testis specific protein Y (TSPY), DYZ3, DYF49S1, RNA binding motif protein (RBM), and DYZ1, spanning on centromeres and short and long arms of the Y chromosome were used for PCR. FISH was carried out using X and Y chromosome enumeration probe for Xp11.1-q11.1 (DXZ1 locus) and Yp11.1-q11.1 (DYZ3 locus), respectively.Among 32 patients with TS, four (12.5%) were positive for Y specific sequence by PCR. Of these, two patients were detected previously by a cytogenetic analysis: 45,X/47,XYY and 45,X/46,XY. Only one Y specific sequence, DYZ3, was detected by PCR in the other two patients without cytogenetically obvious Y chromosome. Y signal was not detected by FISH for the last two patients.It may be reasonable to consider using a PCR method to screen for Y-specific sequences in all patients with TS. Even though we did not demonstrate Y-signal by FISH in patients with PCR positive and cytogenetically no obvious Y chromosome, FISH may be another useful method in TS patient, and futher investigation is nessessary.((PMID:12081133))A cDNA encoding rat homologue of the previously characterized mouse Sox6 was isolated by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning strategy. Comparison of this eDNA with homologous mouse, human and rainbow trout cDNA exhibited an overall amino acid sequence identity of 99.6, 89.3 and 76.3% respectively. The leucine-zipper and HMG-box motif were almost completely conserved between these homologues. The expression of Sox6 was determined in rat by Northern hybridization and Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. rSox6 (rat Sox6) was specifically expressed in the neonatal brain and adult testis with Northern blotting. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for the determination of Sox6 mRNA was examined. The rSox6 was expressed in the neonatal brain and adult testis as well as by Northern blotting and also expressed in the adult eyeball and slightly in the ovary.((PMID:10871192))The SOX (sex-determining region [SRY]-type high mobility group [HMG] box) family of transcription factors play key roles in determining cell fate during organ development. In this study, we have identified a new human SOX gene, SOX13, as encoding the type 1 diabetes autoantigen, islet cell antigen 12 (ICA12). Sequence analysis showed that SOX13 belongs to the class D subgroup of SOX transcription factors, which contain a leucine zipper motif and a region rich in glutamine. SOX13 autoantibodies occurred at a significantly higher frequency among 188 people with type 1 diabetes (18%) than among 88 with type 2 diabetes (6%) or 175 healthy control subjects (4%). Deletion mapping of the antibody epitopes showed that the autoantibodies were primarily directed against an epitope requiring the majority of the protein. SOX13 RNA was detected in most human tissues, with the highest levels in the pancreas, placenta, and kidney. Immunohistochemistry on sections of human pancreas identified SOX13 in the islets of Langerhans, where staining was mostly cytoplasmic. In mouse pancreas, Sox13 was present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of beta-cells as well as other islet cell types. Recombinant SOX13 protein bound to the SOX consensus DNA motif AACAAT, and binding was inhibited by homodimer formation. These observations-along with the known molecular interactions of the closely related protein, rainbow trout Sox23-suggest that SOX13 may be activated for nuclear import and DNA binding through heterodimer formation. In conclusion, we have identified ICA12 as the putative transcription factor SOX13 and demonstrated an increased frequency of autoantibody reactivity in sera from type 1 diabetic subjects compared with type 2 diabetic and healthy control subjects.((PMID:10852465))Leydig cells and Sertoli cells of the testes produce hormones that cause male differentiation, if receptors are present. The Y chromosomal SRY gene (sex determining Region Y gene) acts as TDF and is required for regular male sex determination. SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the HMG-box motif(high-mobility group-box), which acts as DNA binding region. Here, we describe a nonmosaic XY sex-reversed female with pure gonadal dysgenesis (46,XY karyotype, completely female external genitalia, normal Müllerian ducts, absence of Wolffian ducts, streak gonads) who harbored a yolk-sac tumor and was referred for the assessment of primary amenorrhea. Using genomic PCR analysis, a 423-bp PCR product, encompassing the HMG-box of the SRY gene, was amplified from the proposita, her father, and her three brothers, whereas no band was visible in the patient's mother and her three sisters. The PCR products were sequenced for mutations subsequently. A new de novo missense mutation within the HMG-box of the SRY gene was discovered in the proposita. A G is replaced by an A in codon 95 at position +284, resulting in the replacement of the nonpolar aminoacid glycine by the polar amino acid glutamate. The glycine at codon 95 is highly conserved between the family of HMG-box proteins and between species. This point mutation has not been described earlier and brings the total number of SRY mutations described so far to 36, each mutation being unique. This mutation was not detected in the patient's father and her male siblings. The present data provide further evidence to support the functional importance of the putative DNA binding activity of the SRY HMG-box domain.((PMID:9687017))In vertebrates several proteins containing a covalently bound selenocysteine residue have been identified. Among these, selenoprotein P is the most unusual one: depending on the species, 8-12 selenocysteine residues are cotranslationally integrated into the polypeptide chain. The protein was traced in rat plasma, but its role has not been worked out so far. In order to improve our understanding on selenoprotein P we investigated its tissue-specific expression and its genomic DNA. RNA in situ hybridization analyses confirmed the liver-specific expression in mice. Selenoprotein P was also found to be expressed in testis, brain, gut, and hematopoietic cells. The murine selp gene contains five exons within 10.3 kb with a coding sequence restricted to exons 2 to 5. The complete gene including the selp promoter was sequenced. One TATA motif 38 bp upstream to exon 1 suggests transcription of selp by RNA polymerase II. Within the 1116 bp upstream of exon 1 four hepatic nuclear factor 3beta (HNF3beta) binding motifs were found, which is in line with liver-specific expression of selenoprotein P. The expression in hematopoietic cells might be due to multiple GATA-1 motifs. Two BRN-2 motifs suitable for the binding of brain-specific regulatory factors correlated to the selenoprotein P expression in the cerebellum. Selenoprotein P was also expressed in Leydig cells which could be regulated by binding proteins docking to the SRY motifs present in the promoter region.((PMID:9650760))The presence of Y chromosome sequences in Turner syndrome (TS) patients may predispose them to gonadoblastoma formation with an estimated risk of 15-25%. The aim of this study was to determine the presence and the incidence of cryptic Y chromosome material in the genome of TS patients. The methodology involved a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR followed by Southern blot analysis of three genes the sex determining region Y (SRY), testis specific protein Y encoded (TSPY) and RNA binding motif protein (RBM) (previously designated as YRRM) and nine additional STSs spanning all seven intervals of the Y chromosome. The methodology has a high sensitivity as it detects one 46,XY cell among 10(5) 46,XX cells. Reliability was ensured by taking several precautions to avoid false positive results. We report the results of screening 50 TS patients and the identification of cryptic Y chromosome material in 12 (24%) of them. Karyotypes were divided in four groups: 5 (23.8%) patients out of the 21 TS patients which have the 45,X karyotype (group A) also have cryptic Y sequences; none (0%) of the 7 patients who have karyotypes with anomalies on one of the X chromosomes have Y mosaicism (group B); 1 (6.3%) of the 16 patients with a mosaic karyotype have Y material (group C); and 6 (100%) out of 6 patients with a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) have Y chromosome sequences (group D). Nine of the 12 patients positive for cryptic Y material were recalled for a repeat study. Following new DNA extraction, molecular analysis was repeated and, in conjunction with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using the Y centromeric specific probe Yc-2, confirmed the initial positive DNA findings. This study used a reliable and sensitive methodology to identify the presence of Y chromosome material in TS patients thus providing not only a better estimate of a patient's risk in developing either gonadoblastoma or another form of gonadal tumor but also the overall incidence of cryptic Y mosaicism.((PMID:19324078))Evidence from developmental and regeneration studies of the cochlea and other tissues gives reason to hypothesize a role for nonneural cells in the growth and regeneration of cochlear spiral ganglion nerve fibers. We examined the spontaneous associations of regrowing neurites and nonneural cells in mixed cultures of dissociated newborn mouse spiral ganglia. After 7 days in vitro, nonneural cells formed a confluent layer in the culture well. Regrowing neurites grew atop this layer, forming non-uniform patterns that were similar to those formed by endogenously expressed laminin-1, entactin and integrin beta4, but not fibronectin or tenascin. In cultures grown for 42 h and maintained in three different growth media, all regrowing neurites were preferentially associated with spindle-shaped nonneural cells. The spindle-shaped cells incorporated bromodeoxyuridine in culture and were immunoreactive for the proteins S100, laminin-1, laminin-2, SRY-related high-mobility-group box 10 transcription factor (Sox10), neurotrophin receptor (P75) and connexin29 but negative for fibronectin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These cells existed in the culture within a much larger, general population of fibronectin positive cells. Immunolabeling of fixed cochleas from neonatal mice localized Sox10, P75 and connexin29, to peripheral nerve bundles. The observed expressions of protein markers and the bipolar, spindle shape of the neurite-associated cells indicate that they are derived in vitro from the original Schwann or satellite cells in the ganglion or spiral lamina. The spontaneous and preferential association of neurites in culture with mitotic Schwann cells highlights the potential contribution neurite-Schwann cell interactions may have in promoting the growth and regrowth of damaged spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea.((PMID:27397756))To explore that it is necessary to routinely detect chromosomes in infertile patients, we investigated peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype in 16,294 male infertile patients in the north-east of China and analysed the incidence and type of chromosomal anomaly and polymorphism. G-banding karyotype analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed in 16,294 cases. Semen analysis was performed three times in all the men. PCR and FISH confirmed the presence of the SRY gene. The rate of chromosomal anomaly in the 16,294 male infertile patients was 4.15% (677/16,294). The rates of chromosomal anomaly were 0.24% in normal semen group, 12.6% in light oligoasthenospermia group, 4.7% in moderate-to-severe oligoasthenospermia group and 9.59% in azoospermia group. There are two male infertile patients with 45,X chromosome karyotype. One X male patient had confirmed the presence of the SRY gene and FISH analysis demonstrated its location on the p arm of chromosome 13. The other X male patient had not found SRY gene in its whole-genome DNA. Meanwhile, sperm motility is slightly oligo-asthenozoospermic at the age of 35-39 and nearly azoospermic at the age of 40-45. As the rates of chromosomal anomaly are 0.24% and 12.6% even in normal semen group and light oligoasthenospermia group, the rates of chromosomal polymorphism are 5.36% and 25.51% in normal semen group and light oligoasthenospermia group, respectively; it is necessary to explore peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype in all infertile couples. We mentioned that Y, 1, 2, 9 and 12 chromosomes were quite important about male infertility. These findings demonstrate that autosomal retention of SRY can be submicroscopic and emphasise the importance of PCR and FISH in the genetic workup of the monosomic X male. At the same time, it suggested that male infertility might be related to meiotic disturbances with spermatogenetic arrest in Y-autosome translocations, which could result in infertility by reduction of sperm production. Last but not least, ageing is one of the factors that could reduce sperm motility and quality.((PMID:27089505))Testicular or ovotesticular disorder of sex development (DSD) in genetic females (78,XX; SRY-negative) has been reported quite frequently in numerous dog breeds and is usually diagnosed due to the presence of female external genitalia with an enlarged clitoris. The molecular background of this disorder, diagnosed also in human and other mammals, is not fully understood. However, it has recently been proposed that a copy number variation (CNV) in the region upstream of the SOX9 gene is associated with it. We described a rare case of this disorder in a French Bulldog with abdominal testes and male external genitalia (a slightly malformed penis). FISH studies showed a female karyotype, lack of a translocation involving the Y chromosome, and a distinct size variation in the CNV region (CNVR) upstream of the SOX9 gene, located on chromosome 9 (CFA9). A large FISH variant on a single CFA9 and a lack of the variant on its homologue was observed. Surprisingly, in the mother of this DSD dog, 2 normal-sized variants were identified which means that the CNV in the DSD dog was de novo. Our observations are in agreement with earlier suggestions that a high number of copies at the CNVR upstream of SOX9 may be associated with this type of DSD.((PMID:26989023))Somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes have recently been identified in a large proportion of glial tumors of the CNS and reported to be a strong prognostic factor in gliomas whatever the tumor grade. Few data are available in the literature regarding the relationship between IDH mutations and HIF expression in low-grade gliomas (LGGs), especially in a recently described aggressive molecular subtype: "triple negative" (IDH non mutated, 1p 19q non codeleted, p53 expression negative) gliomas. We analyzed clinical, radiological and molecular features of a series of 31 grade II/III gliomas. p53 expression, 1p19q deletion and IDH mutation status were provided for all tumors. Also HIF (hypoxia inducible factor)-1α, HIF-2α, HAF, Sox2 (SRY(Sex determining region Y)-box2) and OCT (octamer binding factor) 3/4 expressions were analyzed. We found positive HIF-2α staining in 38.7% of cases which was uncorrelated to HIF-1α expression or IDH1/2 mutation status. However, HIF-2α staining was significantly associated with HAF expression, a stem-like cell marker, in the whole population. HAF expression was present in 74.2% of cases and significantly correlated to Sox2 expression. Furthermore, HAF expression was significantly associated with the "triple negative" glioma phenotype. We provide here first evidence that HAF, a stem-like cell marker, expression is highly correlated to the triple negative aggressive LGG/AG molecular phenotype suggesting that these tumours might arise from cells of different origin.((PMID:26985348))Chromosomal defects are relatively frequent in infertile men however, translocations between the Y chromosome and autosomes are rare and less than 40 cases of Y-autosome translocation have been reported. In particular, only three individuals has been described with a Y;21 translocation, up to now. We report on an additional case of an infertile man in whom a Y;21 translocation was associated with the deletion of a large part of the Y chromosome long arm. Applying various techniques, including conventional cytogenetic procedures, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) studies, we identified a derivative chromosome originating from a fragment of the short arm of the chromosome Y translocated on the short arm of the 21 chromosome. The Y chromosome structural rearrangement resulted in the intactness of the entire short arm, including the sex-determining region Y (SRY) and the short stature homeobox (SHOX) loci, although translocated on the 21 chromosome, and the loss of a large part of the long arm of the Y chromosome, including azoospermia factor-a (AZFa), AZFb, AZFc and Yq heterochromatin regions. This is the first case in which a (Yp;21p) translocation has been ascertained using an array-CGH approach, thus reporting details of such a rearrangement at higher resolution.((PMID:26966900))Research into prenatal programming in the pig has shown that the sex of the developing embryo or fetus can influence the developmental outcome. Therefore, the ability to determine an embryo's sex is necessary in many experiments particularly regarding early development. The present protocol demonstrates an inexpensive, rapid and non-toxic preparation of pig genomic DNA for use with PCR. Day 30 embryos must be humanely collected according to the guidelines established by Institutional Animal Policy and Welfare Committees for the present protocol. The preparation of the whole embryo for this PCR based sexing technique simply involves grinding the frozen embryo to a fine powder using a pre-chilled mortar and pestle. PCR-quality DNA is released from a small amount of embryo powder by applying a hot incubation in an alkaline lysis reagent. Next, the DNA solution is mixed with neutralization buffer and used directly for PCR. Two primer pairs are generated to detect specific sex determining region of the Y- chromosome (SRY) and ZFX region of the X- chromosome with high accuracy and specificity. The same protocol can be applied to other elongated embryos (Day 10 to Day 14) earlier than Day 30. Also, this protocol can be carried with 96-welled plates when screening a large number of embryos, making it feasible for automation and high-throughput sex typing.((PMID:26953815))Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), 1 of the most common salivary gland malignancies, arises from the intercalated ducts, which are composed of inner ductal epithelial cells and outer myoepithelial cells. The objective of this study was to determine the genomic subtypes of ACC with emphasis on dominant cell type to identify potential specific biomarkers for each subtype and to improve the understanding of this disease.A whole-genome expression study was performed based on 42 primary salivary ACCs and 5 normal salivary glands. RNA from these specimens was subjected to expression profiling with RNA sequencing, and results were analyzed to identify transcripts in epithelial-dominant ACC (E-ACC), myoepithelial-dominant ACC (M-ACC), and all ACC that were expressed differentially compared with the transcripts in normal salivary tissue.In total, the authors identified 430 differentially expressed transcripts that were unique to E-ACC, 392 that were unique to M-ACC, and 424 that were common to both M-ACC and E-ACC. The sets of E-ACC-specific and M-ACC-specific transcripts were sufficiently large to define and differentiate E-ACC from M-ACC. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified known cancer-related genes for 60% of the E-ACC transcripts, 69% of the M-ACC transcripts, and 68% of the transcripts that were common in both E-ACC and M-ACC. Three sets of highly expressed candidate genes-distal-less homeobox 6 (DLX6) for E-ACC; protein keratin 16 (KRT16), SRY box 11 (SOX11), and v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) for M-ACC; and engrailed 1 (EN1) and statherin (STATH), which are common to both E-ACC and M-ACC)-were further validated at the protein level.The current results enabled the authors to identify novel potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers in E-ACC and M-ACC individually, with the implication that EN1, DLX6, and OTX1 (orthodenticle homeobox 1) are potential drivers of these cancers.

With a lack of genomic crossover, MSY is one of the few genomic areas under similar variation and evolutionary selection in inbred and outbred animal populations, allowing for an assessment of evolutionary mechanisms to translate between the populations.Using next-generation sequencing, MSY consomic strains, molecular characterization, and large-scale phenotyping, we present here regions of MSY that contribute to inbred strain phenotypes.We have shown that (1) MSY of rat has nine autosomal gene transposition events with strain-specific selection; (2) sequence variants in MSY occur with a 1.98-fold higher number of variants than other chromosomes in seven sequenced rat strains; (3) Sry, the most studied MSY gene, has undergone extensive gene duplications, driving ubiquitous expression not seen in human or mouse; (4) the expression profile of Sry in the rat is driven by the insertion of the Sry2 copy into an intron of the ubiquitously expressed Kdm5d gene in antisense orientation, but due to several loss of function mutations in the Sry2 protein, nuclear localization and transcriptional control are decreased; (5) expression of Sry copies other than Sry2 in the rat overlaps with the expression profile for human SRY; (6) gene duplications and sequence variants (P76T) of Sry can be selected for phenotypes such as high blood pressure and androgen receptor signaling within inbred mating; and most importantly, (7) per chromosome size, MSY contributes to higher strain-specific phenotypic variation relative to all other chromosomes, with 53 phenotypes showing both a male to female and consomic cross significance.The data presented supports a high probability of MSY genetic variation altering a broad range of inbred rat phenotypes.((PMID:26677084))The swamp type of the Asian water buffalo is assumed to have been domesticated by about 4000 years BP, following the introduction of rice cultivation. Previous localizations of the domestication site were based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation within China, accounting only for the maternal lineage. We carried out a comprehensive sampling of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Nepal and Bangladesh and sequenced the mtDNA Cytochrome b gene and control region and the Y-chromosomal ZFY, SRY and DBY sequences. Swamp buffalo has a higher diversity of both maternal and paternal lineages than river buffalo, with also a remarkable contrast between a weak phylogeographic structure of river buffalo and a strong geographic differentiation of swamp buffalo. The highest diversity of the swamp buffalo maternal lineages was found in south China and north Indochina on both banks of the Mekong River, while the highest diversity in paternal lineages was in the China/Indochina border region. We propose that domestication in this region was later followed by introgressive capture of wild cows west of the Mekong. Migration to the north followed the Yangtze valley as well as a more eastern route, but also involved translocations of both cows and bulls over large distances with a minor influence of river buffaloes in recent decades. Bayesian analyses of various migration models also supported domestication in the China/Indochina border region. Coalescence analysis yielded consistent estimates for the expansion of the major swamp buffalo haplogroups with a credibility interval of 900 to 3900 years BP. The spatial differentiation of mtDNA and Y-chromosomal haplotype distributions indicates a lack of gene flow between established populations that is unprecedented in livestock.((PMID:25987976))Sex differences in pituitary growth hormone (GH) are well documented and coordinate maturation and growth. GH and its receptor are also produced in the brain where they may impact cognitive function and synaptic plasticity, and estradiol produces Gh sex differences in rat hippocampus. In mice, circulating estradiol increases Gh mRNA in female but not in male medial preoptic area (mPOA); therefore, additional factors regulate sexually dimorphic Gh expression in the brain. Thus, we hypothesized that sex chromosomes interact with estradiol to promote sex differences in GH. Here, we assessed the contributions of both estradiol and sex chromosome complement on Gh mRNA levels in three large brain regions: the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum.We used the four core genotypes (FCG) mice, which uncouple effects of sex chromosomes and gonadal sex. The FCG model has a deletion of the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (Sry) and transgenic insertion of Sry on an autosome. Adult FCG mice were gonadectomized and given either a blank Silastic implant or an implant containing 17β-estradiol. Significant differences in GH protein and mRNA were attributed to estradiol replacement, gonadal sex, sex chromosome complement, and their interactions, which were assessed by ANOVA and planned comparisons.Estradiol increased Gh mRNA in the cerebellum and hippocampus, regardless of sex chromosome complement or gonadal sex. In contrast, in the hypothalamus, females had higher Gh mRNA than males, and XY females had more Gh mRNA than XY males and XX females. This same pattern was observed for GH protein. Because the differences in Gh mRNA in the hypothalamus did not replicate prior studies using other mouse models and tissue from mPOA or arcuate nucleus, we examined GH protein in the arcuate, a subdivision of the hypothalamus. Like the previous reports, and in contrast to the entire hypothalamus, a sex chromosome complement effect showed that XX mice had more GH than XY in the arcuate.Sex chromosome complement regulates GH in some but not all brain areas, and within the hypothalamus, sex chromosomes have cell-specific actions on GH. Thus, sex chromosome complement and estradiol both contribute to GH sex differences in the brain.((PMID:25965411))Minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) vaccines have the potential to augment graft-versus-tumor effects without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We used mixed hematopoietic chimerism in the canine model of major histocompatibility complex-matched allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation as a platform to develop a miHA vaccination regimen.We engineered DNA plasmids and replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 constructs encoding large sections of canine SMCY and the entire canine SRY gene.Priming with replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 constructs and boosting with ex vivo plasmid-transfected dendritic cells and cutaneous delivery of plasmids with a particle-mediated epidermal delivery device (PMED) in 2 female dogs induced antigen-specific T-cell responses. Similar responses were observed after a prime-boost vaccine regimen in three female hematopoietic cell transplantation donors. Subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion resulted in a significant change of chimerism in 1 of 3 male recipients without any signs of graft-versus-host disease. The change in chimerism in the recipient occurred in association with the development of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the same peptide pools detected in the donor.These studies describe the first in vivo response to miHA vaccination in a large, outbred animal model without using recipient cells to sensitize the donor. This model provides a platform for ongoing experiments designed to define optimal miHA targets and develop protocols to directly vaccinate the recipient.((PMID:25762186))MRI for in vivo stem cell tracking remains controversial. Here we tested the hypothesis that MRI can track the long-term fate of the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles labelled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) following intramyocardially injection in AMI rats. MSCs (1 × 10(6)) from male rats doubly labeled with SPIO and DAPI were injected 2 weeks after myocardial infarction. The control group received cell-free media injection. In vivo serial MRI was performed at 24 hours before cell delivery (baseline), 3 days, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after cell delivery, respectively. Serial follow-up MRI demonstrated large persistent intramyocardial signal-voids representing SPIO during the follow-up of 4 weeks, and MSCs did not moderate the left ventricular dysfunction. The TUNEL analysis confirmed that MSCs engrafted underwent apoptosis. The histopathological studies revealed that the site of cell injection was infiltrated by inflammatory cells progressively and the iron-positive cells were macrophages identified by CD68 staining, but very few or no DAPI-positive stem cells at 4 weeks after cells transplantation. The presence of engrafted cells was confirmed by real-time PCR, which showed that the amount of Y-chromosome-specific SRY gene was consistent with the results. MRI may not reliably track the long-term fate of SPIO-labeled MSCs engraftment in heart.((PMID:25546075))Processes of development during fetal life profoundly transform tendons from a plastic tissue into a highly differentiated structure, characterised by a very low ability to regenerate after injury in adulthood. Sheep tendon is frequently used as a translational model to investigate cell-based regenerative approaches. However, in contrast to other species, analytical and comparative baseline studies on the normal developmental maturation of sheep tendons from fetal through to adult life are not currently available. Thus, a detailed morphological and biochemical study was designed to characterise tissue maturation during mid- (2 months of pregnancy: 14 cm of length) and late fetal (4 months: 40 cm of length) life, through to adulthood. The results confirm that ovine tendon morphology undergoes profound transformations during this period. Endotenon was more developed in fetal tendons than in adult tissues, and its cell phenotype changed through tendon maturation. Indeed, groups of large rounded cells laying on smaller and more compacted ones expressing osteocalcin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were identified exclusively in fetal mid-stage tissues, and not in late fetal or adult tendons. VEGF, NGF as well as blood vessels and nerve fibers showed decreased expression during tendon development. Moreover, the endotenon of mid- and late fetuses contained identifiable cells that expressed several pluripotent stem cell markers [Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT), SRY Determining Region Y Box-2 (SOX2), Nanog Homeobox (NANOG) and Octamer Binding Transcription Factor-4A (OCT-4A)]. These cells were not identifiable in adult specimens. Ovine tendon development was also accompanied by morphological modifications to cell nuclei, and a progressive decrease in cellularity, proliferation index and expression of connexins 43 and 32. Tendon maturation was similarly characterised by modulation of several other gene expression profiles, including Collagen type I, Collagen type III, Scleraxis B, Tenomodulin, Trombospondin 4 and Osteocalcin. These gene profiles underwent a dramatic reduction in adult tissues. Transforming growth factor-β~1 expression (involved in collagen synthesis) underwent a similar decrease. In conclusion, these morphological studies carried out on sheep tendons at different stages of development and aging offer normal structural and molecular baseline data to allow accurate evaluation of data from subsequent interventional studies investigating tendon healing and regeneration in ovine experimental models.((PMID:25497574))One in 4500 children is born with ambiguous genitalia, milder phenotypes occur in one in 300 newborns. Conventional time-consuming hormonal and genetic work-up provides a genetic diagnosis in around 20-40% of 46,XY cases with ambiguous genitalia. All others remain without a definitive diagnosis. The investigation of milder cases, as suggested by recent reports remains controversial.Integrated clinical, hormonal and genetic screening was performed in a sequential series of 46, XY children, sex-assigned male, who were referred to our pediatric endocrine service for atypical genitalia (2007-2013).A consecutive cohort of undervirilized 46,XY children with external masculinization score (EMS) 2-12, was extensively investigated. In four patients, a clinical diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome or Mowat-Wilson syndrome was made and genetically supported in 2/3 and 1/1 cases respectively. Hormonal data were suggestive of a (dihydro)testosterone biosynthesis disorder in four cases, however no HSD17B3 or SRD5A2 mutations were found. Array-CGH revealed a causal structural variation in 2/6 syndromic patients. In addition, three novel NR5A1 mutations were found in non-syndromic patients. Interestingly, one mutation was present in a fertile male, underlining the inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability of NR5A1-associated phenotypes. No AR, SRY or WT1 mutations were identified.Overall, a genetic diagnosis could be established in 19% of non-syndromic and 33% of syndromic cases. There is no difference in diagnostic yield between patients with more or less pronounced phenotypes, as expressed by the external masculinisation score (EMS). The clinical utility of array-CGH is high in syndromic cases. Finally, a sequential gene-by-gene approach is time-consuming, expensive and inefficient. Given the low yield and high expense of Sanger sequencing, we anticipate that massively parallel sequencing of gene panels and whole exome sequencing hold promise for genetic diagnosis of 46,XY DSD boys with an undervirilized phenotype.((PMID:25308063))Horses are characterized as having a greater rate of chromosomal abnormalities than other species, which are mainly related to the sex chromosome pair and produce a series of different anomalies known as disorders in sexual development (DSD). In the present study, three Pura Raza Española (PRE) and one Menorquín (MEN) horses were studied and an incompatibility in their genetic and phenotypic sex were detected. Animals were karyotyped by conventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses and characterized using genomic techniques. Although all individuals, were totally unrelated, these animals had the same abnormality (64,XY SRY negative DSD) despite having an anatomically normal external mare phenotype. Therefore, this syndrome could remain undiagnosed in a large percentage of cases because the physiological and morphological symptoms are rare. In the present study, a slight gonadal dysgenesis was observed only in older individuals. Interestingly this chromosomal abnormality has been previously reported less than twenty times, and never in the PRE or MEN horses. With the present research, it is demonstrated that the use of genetic and cytogenetic diagnostic tools in veterinary practice could be an important complementary test to determine the origin of unexplained reproductive failures among horses.((PMID:25247640))The commitment of the embryonic gonad towards the male or female fate is a sequential and complex developmental process. The sex-independent growth and development of the adrenogonadal primordium into the bipotential gonadal ridge is committed to the formation of testis in the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. SRY upregulates the expression of SOX9 that sets into motion a cascade of complex genetic interactions for the formation of male internal and external genitalia whilst repressing the formation of female genitalia. The initiation and maintenance of somatic sex of the gonad as either male or female is achieved by suppression of the alternate fate. However, at least in mice, the primary sex-determining decision is not final but is maintained in adulthood by a mutually antagonistic double-repressive pathway. In the human, any imbalance between these two antagonistic genetic and physiological pathways results in inappropriate gonad differentiation and function leading to disorders of sex development (DSD). Genetic analysis of individuals presenting with DSD and sex-reversed mice has revealed a number of sexually dimorphic genes that are involved in the formation of mammalian gonads, which are discussed in this chapter. Despite an increase in the knowledge of genes involved in mammalian sex determination, the molecular mechanisms remain by and large undetermined. The use of novel 'omics' technologies for analyzing a large number of patients with DSD, and careful assessment of the resulting datasets may result in the identification of novel genetic factors in human sex determination and lead to the development of novel ex vivo cellular models.((PMID:25236417))The extant Cabrera's vole, Microtus cabrerae, differs in morphology and evolutionary history from the other species of Microtus. This arvicoline has unique derived features in the cranium, mandible and dentition. Probably its most conspicuous features are its large size, the high skull in lateral view, the long and distally broad nasals, and the triangle shape of the anteroconid complex, with a marked labio-lingual asymmetry of the occlusal surface of the first lower molars. In this study, we propose a phylogenetic lineage that includes Cabrera's vole in what until now has been the Microtus subgenus Iberomys. Paleontological information and several life history traits support the elevation of Iberomys to the rank of genus. Genus Iberomys comprises species that have appeared in succession during the Quaternary: in the Early Pleistocene, the extinct I. huescarensis in the Middle Pleistocene, the extinct I. mediterraneus and in the Late Pleistocene, the extant I. cabrerae. Interestingly, the extant species shows several biological singularities, such as multiple polymorphic copies of the SRY male-specific gene in both males and females, and the lowest basal metabolic rate in relation to weight among arvicoline species. Likewise, its habitat requirement is unique among the Iberian arvicolines. Accordingly, the biological and paleontological data that we present in this work support the elevation of its taxonomic rank to that of genus. This study also suggests a modification of nomenclature: Microtus (Iberomys) brecciensis is replaced with I. mediterraneus and the common name of the extant M. (I.) cabrerae changed from 'topillo' to 'iberon' to improve conservation and protection actions.((PMID:25227289))We report on a patient with a 47,XXY karyotype who presents a normal female phenotype, which is an extremely rare observation worldwide. The patient is infertile. Type B ultrasound scans and other tests suggested that her ovaries had completely failed. Microsatellite DNA marker analysis revealed that the 2 X chromosomes were derived from her mother and that this abnormality was caused by non-disjunction of the maternal X chromosomes during meiosis II. Copy number variation analysis identified 2 large de novo deletions in her Y chromosome. Remarkably, one of the deleted regions includes the SRY gene locus, which might explain her female phenotype. However, the genetic mechanism of her ovarian failure remains unclear. This paper is the first report of a 47,XXY female with ovarian failure.((PMID:24972717))Relatively little is known about cellular subpopulations in the mature nucleus pulposus (NP). Detailed understanding of the ontogenetic, cellular and molecular characteristics of functional intervertebral disc (IVD) cell populations is pivotal to the successful development of cell replacement therapies and IVD regeneration. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether phenotypically distinct clonal cell lines representing different subpopulations in the human NP could be generated using immortalization strategies.Nondegenerate healthy disc material (age range, 8 to 15 years) was obtained as surplus surgical material. Early passage NP monolayer cell cultures were initially characterized using a recently established NP marker set. NP cells were immortalized by simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LTag) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression. Immortalized cells were clonally expanded and characterized based on collagen type I, collagen type II, α1 (COL2A1), and SRY-box 9 (SOX9) protein expression profiles, as well as on expression of a subset of established in vivo NP cell lineage markers.A total of 54 immortal clones were generated. Profiling of a set of novel NP markers (CD24, CA12, PAX1, PTN, FOXF1 and KRT19 mRNA) in a representative set of subclones substantiated successful immortalization of multiple cellular subpopulations from primary isolates and confirmed their NP origin and/or phenotype. We were able to identify two predominant clonal NP subtypes based on their morphological characteristics and their ability to induce SOX9 and COL2A1 under conventional differentiation conditions. In addition, cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24)-negative NP responder clones formed spheroid structures in various culture systems, suggesting the preservation of a more immature phenotype compared to CD24-positive nonresponder clones.Here we report the generation of clonal NP cell lines from nondegenerate human IVD tissue and present a detailed characterization of NP cellular subpopulations. Differential cell surface marker expression and divergent responses to differentiation conditions suggest that the NP subtypes may correspond to distinct maturation stages and represent distinct NP cell subpopulations. Hence, we provide evidence that the immortalization strategy that we applied is capable of detecting cell heterogeneity in the NP. Our cell lines yield novel insights into NP biology and provide promising new tools for studies of IVD development, cell function and disease.((PMID:24608928))Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries are extremely valuable for the genome-wide genetic dissection of complex organisms. The Siberian tiger, one of the most well-known wild primitive carnivores in China, is an endangered animal. In order to promote research on its genome, a high-redundancy BAC library of the Siberian tiger was constructed and characterized. The library is divided into two sub-libraries prepared from blood cells and two sub-libraries prepared from fibroblasts. This BAC library contains 153,600 individually archived clones; for PCR-based screening of the library, BACs were placed into 40 superpools of 10 × 384-deep well microplates. The average insert size of BAC clones was estimated to be 116.5 kb, representing approximately 6.46 genome equivalents of the haploid genome and affording a 98.86% statistical probability of obtaining at least one clone containing a unique DNA sequence. Screening the library with 19 microsatellite markers and a SRY sequence revealed that each of these markers were present in the library; the average number of positive clones per marker was 6.74 (range 2 to 12), consistent with 6.46 coverage of the tiger genome. Additionally, we identified 72 microsatellite markers that could potentially be used as genetic markers. This BAC library will serve as a valuable resource for physical mapping, comparative genomic study and large-scale genome sequencing in the tiger.((PMID:26455178))To explore the conditions of synovial derived mesenchymal stem cells (SMSCs) differentiating into the fibrocartilage cells by using the orthogonal experiment.The synovium was harvested from 5 adult New Zealand white rabbits, and SMSCs were separated by adherence method. The flow cytometry and multi-directional differentiation method were used to identify the SMSCs. The conditions were found from the preliminary experiment and literature review. The missing test was carried out to screen the conditions and then 12 conditions were used for the orthogonal experiment, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2), dexamethasone (DEX), proline, ascorbic acid (ASA), pyruvic acid, insulin + transferrin + selenious acid pre-mixed solution (ITS), bovin serum albumin (BSA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), intermittent hydraulic pressure (IHP), bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP-7), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF). The L60 (212) orthogonal experiment was designed using the SPSS 18.0 with 2 level conditions and the cells were induced to differentiate on the small intestinal submucosa (SIS)-3D scaffold. The CD151+/CD44+ cells were detected with the flow cytometry and then the differentiation rate was recorded. The immumohistochemical staining, cellular morphology, toluidine blue staining, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR examination for the gene expressions of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 gene (Sox9), aggrecan gene (AGN), collagen type I gene (Col I), collagen type II gene (Col II), collagen type IX gene (Col IX) were used for result confirmation. The differentiation rate was calculated as the product of CD151/CD44+ cells and cells with Col I high expression. The grow curve was detected with the DNA abundance using the PicoGreen Assay. The visual observation and the variances analysis among the variable were used to evaluate the result of the orthogonal experiment, 1 level interaction was considered. The q-test and the least significant difference (LDS) were used for the variance analysis with a type III calibration model. The test criteria (a) was 0.05.The cells were certified as SMSCs, the double-time of the cells was 28 hours. During the differentiation into the fibrocartilage, the volume of the SIS-3D scaffold enlarged double every 5 days. The scaffolds were positively stained by toluidine blue at 14 days. The visual observation showed that high levels of TGF-β1 and BMP-7 were optimum for the differentiation, and BMP-7 showed the interaction with BMP-2. The conditions of DEX, ASA, ITS, transferrin, bFGF showed decreasing promotional function by degrees, and the model showed the perfect relevance. P value was 0.000 according to the variance analysis. The intercept analysis showed different independent variables brought about variant contribution; the TGF-β1, ASA, bFGF, IGF, and BMP-7 were more remarkable, which were similar to the visual observation.In the process of the SMSCs differentiation into the fibrocartilage, the concentrations of TGF-β1, ASA, bFGF, and IGF reasonably can improve the conversion rate of the fibrocartilage cells. The accurate conditions of the reaulatory factor should be explored further.((PMID:22960220))Retinoid-inducible gene 1 (RIG1), also called tazarotene-induced gene 3, belongs to the HREV107 gene family, which contains five members in humans. RIG1 is expressed in high levels in well-differentiated tissues, but its expression is decreased in cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. We found RIG1 to be highly expressed in testicular cells. When RIG1 was expressed in NT2/D1 testicular cancer cells, neither cell death nor cell viability was affected. However, RIG1 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in NT2/D1 cells. We found that prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) interacted with RIG1 using yeast two-hybrid screens. Further, we found PTGDS to be co-localized with RIG1 in NT2/D1 testis cells. In RIG1-expressing cells, elevated levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), cAMP, and SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (SOX9) were observed. This indicated that RIG1 can enhance PTGDS activity. Silencing of PTGDS expression significantly decreased RIG1-mediated cAMP and PGD2 production. Furthermore, silencing of PTGDS or SOX9 alleviated RIG1-mediated suppression of migration and invasion. These results suggest that RIG1 will suppress cell migration/invasion through the PGD2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, RIG1 can interact with PTGDS to enhance its function and to further suppress NT2/D1 cell migration and invasion. Our study suggests that RIG1-PGD2 signaling might play an important role in cancer cell suppression in the testis.((PMID:20941779))The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, and particularly between mouse and other mammals. To evaluate SRY function in a nonrodent species, we produced an antibody against goat SRY and used it to investigate the expression pattern of SRY throughout goat testicular development. By contrast with the mouse, SRY is primarily expressed in most cells of XY genital-ridges and not solely in pre-Sertoli cells. Between cord formation and prepuberty, SRY remains expressed in both Sertoli and germinal cells. During adulthood, SRY expression declines and then disappears from meiotic germ cells, only remaining present at low levels in some spermatogonia. Unlike the germinal lineage, SRY continues to be highly expressed in adult Sertoli cells with a typical nuclear staining. Our data indicate that in goat, the role of SRY may not be limited to testis determination and could have other functions in testicular maintenance and hence male fertility.((PMID:16765952))The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, particularly between mouse and other mammals, both in terms of protein structure and of expression regulation. To evaluate SRY phylogenic conservation in regards to its function, we expressed the goat gene (gSRY) in XX transgenic mouse gonads. Here, we show that gSRY induces testis formation, despite a goat expression profile. Our results demonstrate that sex-reversal can be induced in XX-mice by a non-mouse SRY thus suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism of action of this testis-determining gene across mammalian species.((PMID:14684983))In mammals, the Y-located SRY gene is known to induce testis formation from the indifferent gonad. A related gene, SOX9, also plays a critical role in testis differentiation in mammals, in birds and reptiles. It is now assumed that SRY acts upstream of SOX9 in the sex determination cascade, but the regulatory link which should exist between these two genes remains unknown. Studies on XX sex reversal in polled goats (PIS mutation: Polled Intersex Syndrome) have led to the discovery of a female-specific locus crucial for ovarian differentiation. This genomic region is composed of at least two genes, FOXL2 and PISRT1, which share a common transcriptional regulatory region, PIS. In this review, we present the expression pattern of these PIS-regulated genes in mice. The FOXL2 expression profile of mice is similar to that described in goats in accordance with a conserved role of this ovarian differentiating gene in mammals. On the contrary, the PISRT1 expression profile is different between mice and goats, suggesting different mechanisms of the primary switch in the testis determination process within mammals. A model based on two different modes of SOX9 regulation in mice and other mammals is proposed in order to integrate our results into the current scheme of gonad differentiation.((PMID:11678506))SOX genes are a family of genes that encode for proteins which are characterised by the presence of a HMG-domain related to that of the mammalian sex-determining gene (SRY). By definition, the DNA binding domain of SOX genes is at least 50% identical to the 79 amino acid HMG domain of the SRY gene. We report here two HMG-box sequences from two microbat species (R. ferrumequinum and P. Pipistrellus) which were PCR amplified using a primer pair specific to the mouse Sry HMG-box. The high percentage of identity of this sequences with the human and mouse SOX30 HMG-box suggests that they are the SOX30 HMG-box for these two bat species.((PMID:9858707))Concentration of maternal BICOID (BCD) establishes the anterior pattern in the Drosophila embryo. Successive deletions in the bcd promoter allowed us to localize an enhancer sequence in the 5'-UTR and a down-regulating element downstream of the ATG initiator codon, and identify a 49 bp region sufficient to drive transcription of a reporter gene specifically in nurse cells. This fragment contains two binding sites for the Serendipity (Sry) d zinc finger activator, that mediate its cooperative binding. Both sites (sdbs) are essential for bcd expression. Further analysis showed that the bcd promoter configuration is decisive for Sry d activating function. Replacement of sdbs by binding sites for Sry b, the Sry d paralog, restores bcd transcription in sry d mutant ovaries, demonstrating that the functional divergence between these two proteins during evolution was mainly driven by changes in their DNA-specific recognition properties, resulting in the control of separate developmental pathways.((PMID:27103433))The drug discovery research for cholestatic liver diseases has been hampered by the lack of a well-established human cholangiocyte model. Functional cholangiocyte-like cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are expected to be a promising candidate for such research, but there remains no well-established method for differentiating cholangiocytes from human iPS cells. In this study, we searched for a suitable extracellular matrix to promote cholangiocyte differentiation from human iPS cells, and found that both laminin 411 and laminin 511 were suitable for this purpose. The gene expression levels of the cholangiocyte markers, aquaporin 1 (AQP1), SRY-box 9 (SOX9), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1), Jagged 1 (JAG1), secretin receptor (SCTR), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT1) were increased by using laminin 411 or laminin 511 as a matrix. In addition, the percentage of AQP1-positive cells was increased from 61.8% to 92.5% by using laminin 411 or laminin 511. Furthermore, the diameter and number of cysts consisted of cholangiocyte-like cells were increased when using either matrix. We believe that the human iPS cell-derived cholangiocyte-like cells, which were generated by using our differentiation technology, would be useful for the drug discovery research of cholestatic liver diseases.((PMID:17143943))To investigate the effect of transplanted fetal liver epithelial progenitor (FLEP) cells on liver fibrosis in mice.FLEP cells were isolated from embryonal day (ED) 14 BALB/c mice and transplanted into female syngenic BALB/c mice (n = 60). After partial hepatectomy (PH), diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was administered to induce liver fibrosis. Controls received FLEP cells and non-supplemented drinking water, the model group received DEN-spiked water, and the experimental group received FLEP cells and DEN. Mice were killed after 1, 2, and 3 mo, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hyaluronic acid (HA), and laminin (LN) in serum, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in liver were assessed. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) of liver was tested by immunohistochemistry. Transplanted male mice FLEP cells were identified by immunocytochemistry for sry (sex determination region for Y chromosome) protein.Serum ALT, AST, HA, and LN were markedly reduced by transplanted FLEP cells. Liver Hyp content and alpha-SMA staining in mice receiving FLEP cells were lower than that of the model group, which was consistent with altered liver pathology. Transplanted cells proliferated and differentiated into hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells with 30%-50% repopulation in the liver fibrosis induced by DEN after 3 mo.Transplanted FLEP cells proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells with high repopulation capacity in the fiberized liver induced by DEN, which restores liver function and reduces liver fibrosis.((PMID:11122249))The autoimmune nature of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is well established. We tested the hypothesis that fetal microchimerism indicated by the persistence of circulating fetal cells in women years after pregnancy might contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of PBC through a graft-versus-host-like response. We extracted DNA from the peripheral blood cells of 36 women carefully selected from 173 consecutive PBC patients, who were matched with 36 healthy women by age, age of last son, and number of children. Both patients and controls had to have male offspring, and no history of miscarriages or blood transfusions; they could not be twins. We tested all of the samples for the presence of two specific Y-chromosome sequences (SY154 and SRY) by amplifying DNA in a nested polymerase chain reaction. Y-chromosome-specific DNA was detected in the peripheral blood cell DNA of 13 (36%) of the 36 women with PBC and in 11 (31%) of the 36 healthy controls. The two groups of PBC patients with and without male DNA sequences were similar in terms of their clinical, biochemical, and serological features. Y-chromosome sequences were found in three of the four PBC women with associated systemic sclerosis. All of the 24 Y-positive samples contained SY154 sequences, but only three PBC patients and six controls showed the presence of both SY154 and SRY sequences. This discrepancy may suggest that not only fetal cells but also fragments of fetal DNA are present in maternal circulation. Overall, our data do not support the hypothesis that fetal microchimerism plays a significant role in the onset or progression of PBC.((PMID:27185484))Developmental exposure to arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands abolishes sex differences in a wide range of neural structures and functions. A well-studied example is the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), a structure that controls sex-specific luteinizing hormone (LH) release. In the male, testosterone (T) secreted by the developing testes defeminizes LH release mechanisms; conversely, perinatal AhR activation by 2,3,7,8,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) blocks defeminization. To better understand developmental mechanisms altered by TCDD exposure, we first verified that neonatal TCDD exposure in male rats prevented the loss of AVPV GABA/glutamate neurons that are critical for female-typical LH surge release. We then used whole genome arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to compare AVPV transcriptomes of males treated neonatally with TCDD or vehicle. Our bioinformatics analyses showed that TCDD enriched gene sets important for neuron development, synaptic transmission, ion homeostasis, and cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, upstream regulatory analysis suggests that both estrogen receptors (ER) and androgen receptors (AR) regulate genes targeted by TCDD. Of the 23 mRNAs found to be changed by TCDD at least 2-fold (p<0.05), most participate in the functions identified in our bioinformatics analyses. Several, including matrix metallopeptidase 9 and SRY-box 11 (Sox11), are known targets of E2. CUG triplet repeat, RNA binding protein 2 (cugbp2) is particularly interesting because it is sex-specific, oppositely regulated by estradiol (E2) and TCDD. Moreover, it regulates the post-transcriptional processing of molecules previously linked to sexual differentiation of the brain. These findings provide new insights into how TCDD may interfere with defeminization of LH release patterns.((PMID:24962540))Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level is a clinically important quantitative phenotype that widely varies among inbred mouse strains. Several genes or loci associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels have been identified on autosomes and the X chromosome. In contrast, genes or loci on the Y chromosome have not attracted significant attention hitherto. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the Y chromosome on plasma HDL-cholesterol levels in Y- chromosome-consomic (Y-consomic) mouse strains.Plasma HDL-cholesterol level data from 16 Y-consomic strains demonstrated that the Y chromosome substitutions significantly altered plasma HDL-cholesterol levels, i.e., variations in the plasma HDL-cholesterol level could be partially explained by Y chromosome genes. We obtained the following results from the genotype data on 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs and 9 polymorphisms in Sry: (1) Variation in rs46947134 of Uty was significantly associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. (2) A CAG repeat number polymorphism in Sry was significantly associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. (3) Strains with a certain haplotype of the Mus musculus domesticus-type Y chromosome had significantly lower plasma HDL-cholesterol levels than strains with a certain haplotype of the M. m. musculus-type Y chromosome.The effect of the Y chromosome on plasma HDL-cholesterol levels was confirmed in the Y-consomic strains. We identified several variants associated with plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. Because the physiological significance of various Y-linked genes remains unclear, the results of this study will provide further insights into the functions of Y-linked genes in lipid metabolism.((PMID:22128028))Genome analysis of patients with disorders of sex development, and gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice indicate that gonadal development is regulated by opposing signals. In females, the Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway blocks testicular differentiation by repressing the expression of the Sertoli cell-specific gene Sox9 by an unknown mechanism. Using cell and embryonic gonad culture models, we show that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibits the expression of Sox9 and Amh, whereas mRNA and protein levels of Sry and steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1), two key transcriptional regulators of Sox9, are not altered. Ectopic activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in male gonads led to a loss of Sf1 binding to the Tesco enhancer and absent Sox9 expression that we also observed in wild-type ovaries. Moreover, ectopic Wnt/β-catenin signaling induced the expression of the female somatic cell markers, Bmp2 and Rspo1, as a likely consequence of Sox9 loss. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in XY gonads did not, however, affect gene expression of the steroidogenic Leydig cell Sf1 target gene, Cyp11a1, or Sf1 binding to the Cyp11a1 promoter. Our data support a model in ovary development whereby activation of β-catenin prevents Sf1 binding to the Sox9 enhancer, thereby inhibiting Sox9 expression and Sertoli cell differentiation.((PMID:21938520))Niemann-Pick type C 1 (NPC1) disease is an autosomal recessive cholesterol transport defect resulting in a neurodegenerative process in patients mainly at an early age, although some patients may start with manifestation in adult. Since loss of myelin is considered as a main pathogenetic factor, the precise mechanism inducing dysmylination in NPC1 disease is still unclear. In the present study, a quantitative evaluation on the myelin protein and its regulatory factors of oligodendrocytes, such as SRY-related HMG-box 10 (Sox10), Yin Yang 1 factor (YY1) and myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF), in different parts of the brain and spinal cord was performed in NPC1-mutant mice. The results showed that NPC1 protein was expressed in oligodendrocytes and the amount of myelin protein was generally decreased in all parts of the brain and spinal cord in NPC1-mutant mice. Compared to wild type, the amount of Sox10 and YY1 was not different in NPC1-mutant mice, but MRF was significantly decreased, suggesting a possible mechanism perturbing differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the myelination process in the NPC1-mutant mouse.((PMID:18971546))Excess cardiovascular risk in men compared with women has been suggested to be partly explained by effects of the Y chromosome. However, inconsistent results have been reported on the Y chromosome's genetic influence on blood pressure and lipid levels. The purpose of the present study was to settle the question whether genetic variants of the Y chromosome influence cardiovascular risk factors using a large epidemiological cohort, the Suita study. Possible influences of the Y chromosome polymorphisms (Y chromosome Alu insertion polymorphism [YAP], M175 and SRY+465) on cardiovascular risk factors were assessed in 974 Japanese men. The frequency of the YAP(+) allele in our study sample was 0.31. The prevalence of hypertension tended to be higher in YAP(+) than in YAP(-) men, and this tendency was found to be stronger among men aged 65 years or older. Men with the YAP(+) genotype had higher levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with those with the YAP(-) genotype, even after adjustment for age, body mass index, and daily ethanol and cigarette consumption (57.0+/-14.6 mg/dL vs. 54.2+/-14.2 mg/dL, nominal p=0.011, adjusted p=0.0062). However, these observed nominal associations disappeared after adjusting for multiple testing (Bonferroni). No association was detected between the YAP genotype and myocardial infarction. Similarly, none of the associations with M175 and SRY+465 attained significance when multiple testing was taken into account. In conclusion, Y chromosome polymorphisms (YAP, M175 and SRY+465) do not appear to be associated with cardiovascular risk factors in Japanese men. Studies using much larger sample sizes and/or additional independent samples will be required for definitive conclusions.((PMID:17192299))The phenotype in Turner syndrome (TS) is variable, even in patients with a supposedly nonmosaic karyotype. Previous work suggested that there were X-linked parent-of-origin effects on the phenotype.The TS phenotype is influenced by the parental origin of the missed X chromosome.This was a multicenter prospective study of TS patients and both their parents, determining parental origin of the X-chromosome, and characterizing the clinical phenotype.Eighty-three TS patients and their parents were studied. Inclusion criteria were TS with karyotype 45,X or 46Xi(Xq). Four highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on the X-chromosome DMD49, DYSII, DXS1283, and the androgen receptor gene and three Y chromosome markers, SRY, DYZ1, and DYZ3.The study determined the correlation between the parental origin of the X chromosome and the unique phenotypic traits of TS including congenital malformations, anthropometry and growth pattern, skeletal defects, endocrine traits, education, and vocation.Eighty-three percent of 45,X retained their maternal X (X(m)), whereas 64% 46Xi(Xq) retained their paternal X (X(p), P < 0.001). Kidney malformations were exclusively found in X(m) patients (P = 0.030). The X(m) group had lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.003), and higher body mass index sd score (P = 0.030) that was not maintained after GH treatment. Response to GH therapy was comparable. Ocular abnormalities were more common in the paternal X group (P = 0.017), who also had higher academic achievement.The parental origin of the missing short arm of the X chromosome has an impact on overweight, kidney, eye, and lipids, which suggests a potential effect of an as-yet-undetermined X chromosome gene imprinting.((PMID:15581876))Genes previously implicated in mammalian sexual development have either a male- or female-specific role. The signaling molecule WNT4 has been shown to be important in female sexual development. Lack of Wnt4 gives rise to masculinization of the XX gonad and we showed previously that the role of WNT4 was to inhibit endothelial and steroidogenic cell migration into the developing ovary. Here we show that Wnt4 also has a function in the male gonad. We find that Sertoli cell differentiation is compromised in Wnt4 mutant testes and that this defect occurs downstream of the testis-determining gene Sry but upstream of Sox9 and Dhh, two early Sertoli cell markers. Genetic analysis shows that this phenotype is primarily due to the action of WNT4 within the early genital ridge. Analysis of different markers identifies the most striking difference in the genital ridge at early stages of its development between wild-type and Wnt4 mutant embryos to be a significant increase of steroidogenic cells in the Wnt4 -/- gonad. These results identify WNT4 as a new factor involved in the mammalian testis determination pathway and show that genes can have a specific but distinct role in both male and female gonad development.((PMID:14582455))The effects of apolipoprotein (Apo) AI mimetic peptide synthesized from D- and L-amino acids on atherosclerotic lesion formation were investigated in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient mice on a Western diet and in apoE null mice. In addition, their effects on the inflammatory changes induced in LDL-receptor mice fed a Western diet following influenza A infection were studied. When apolipoprotein AI mimetic peptides synthesized from either D- or L-amino acids were administered to LDL-receptor null mice, only peptides synthesized from D-amino acids were stable in the circulation and enhanced the ability of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to protect LDL against oxidation. Administration of the peptide D-4F to LDL-receptor null mice and apoE null mice decreased lesion size. Additionally, in LDL receptor null mice after influenza infection, D-4F treatment increased plasma HDL levels and paraoxonase activity, and inhibited increased in LDL-cholesterol and peak levels of interleukin-6 post-infection. Injection of female mice with male macrophages, and subsequent measurement of the male 'sry' gene, revealed a marked increase in macrophage traffic into the aortic arch after infection that was prevented by administration of D-4F. This indicates that: (i) oral D-4F has powerful anti-atherosclerotic properties, and (ii) the loss of the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL after influenza infection in mice is associated with increased arterial macrophage traffic that can be prevented by administration of D-4F.((PMID:12223418))In mammals, Sry expression in the bipotential, undifferentiated gonad directs the support cell precursors to differentiate as Sertoli cells, thus initiating the testis differentiation pathway. In the absence of Sry, or if Sry is expressed at insufficient levels, the support cell precursors differentiate as granulosa cells, thus initiating the ovarian pathway. The molecular mechanisms upstream and downstream of Sry are not well understood. We demonstrate that the transcription factor GATA4 and its co-factor FOG2 are required for gonadal differentiation. Mouse fetuses homozygous for a null allele of Fog2 or homozygous for a targeted mutation in Gata4 (Gata4(ki)) that abrogates the interaction of GATA4 with FOG co-factors exhibit abnormalities in gonadogenesis. We found that Sry transcript levels were significantly reduced in XY Fog2(-/-) gonads at E11.5, which is the time when Sry expression normally reaches its peak. In addition, three genes crucial for normal Sertoli cell function (Sox9, Mis and Dhh) and three Leydig cell steroid biosynthetic enzymes (p450scc, 3betaHSD and p450c17) were not expressed in XY Fog2(-/-) and Gata(ki/ki) gonads, whereas Wnt4, a gene required for normal ovarian development, was expressed ectopically. By contrast, Wt1 and Sf1, which are expressed prior to Sry and necessary for gonad development in both sexes, were expressed normally in both types of mutant XY gonads. These results indicate that GATA4 and FOG2 and their physical interaction are required for normal gonadal development.((PMID:12196340))We reported that HDL loses its antiinflammatory properties during acute influenza A infection in mice, and we hypothesized that these changes might be associated with increased trafficking of macrophages into the artery wall. The present study tested this hypothesis.D-4F, an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide, or vehicle in which it was dissolved (PBS) was administered daily to LDL receptor-null mice after a Western diet and after influenza infection. D-4F treatment increased plasma HDL cholesterol and paraoxonase activity compared with PBS and inhibited increases in LDL cholesterol and peak levels of interleukin-6 after infection. Lung viral titers were reduced by 50% in mice receiving D-4F. Injection of female mice with male macrophages, which were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure the male Sry gene, revealed a marked increase in macrophage traffic into the aortic arch and innominate arteries after infection that was prevented by administration of D-4F.We conclude that loss of antiinflammatory properties of HDL after influenza infection in mice is associated with increased arterial macrophage traffic that can be prevented by administration of D-4F.((PMID:11076952))A testicular form of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL(tes)), a triacylglycerol lipase, and cholesterol esterase, is expressed in male germ cells. Northern blot analysis showed HSL(tes) mRNA expression in early spermatids. Immunolocalization of the protein in human and rodent seminiferous tubules indicated that the highest level of expression occurred in elongated spermatids. We have previously shown that 0.5 kilobase pairs of the human HSL(tes) promoter directs testis-specific expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transgenic mice and determined regions binding nuclear proteins expressed in testis but not in liver (Blaise, R., Grober, J., Rouet, P., Tavernier, G., Daegelen, D., and Langin, D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 9327-9334). Mutation of a SRY/Sox-binding site in one of the regions did not impair in vivo testis-specific expression of the reporter gene. Further transgenic analyses established that 95 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site were sufficient for correct testis expression. In gel retardation assays using early spermatid nuclear extracts, a germ cell-specific DNA-protein interaction was mapped between -46 and -29 base pairs. The DNA binding nuclear protein showed properties of zinc finger transcription factors. Mutation of the region abolished reporter gene activity in transgenic mice, showing that it is necessary for testis expression of HSL(tes).((PMID:7671103))Patients with ambiguous genitalia stand a far better chance of receiving a rapid diagnosis, appropriate replacement therapy, and functional surgical reconstruction than was the case even a decade ago. Although the etiologies of true hermaphroditism and mixed gonadal dysgenesis remain elusive, most gene defects in female pseudohermaphroditism or CAH have been pinpointed to the 21-hydroxylase gene. Incomplete masculinization has been found to be due to defects in the androgen receptor, 5 alpha-reductase, or enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to testosterone. SRY point mutations have been implicated in 46XY pure gonadal dysgenesis. Retained müllerian ducts have been attributed to point mutations in the MIS gene; those with normal MIS levels should be expected to have receptor deficits. In utero diagnoses and treatment and diagnosis at the preimplantation stage may prove to be very important for the care of some of these patients, who may be potential candidates for gene replacement therapy. When necessary, surgical reconstruction can be done. If the child is to be raised as a female, clitoral recession, labioscrotal reductions and advancements, and vaginoplasties for exteriorization can be accomplished in early infancy as an extensive one-stage procedure. If patients are to be raised as males, then various types of hypospadias repair can be done, gonads can be replaced with prostheses, the prepenile scrotum can be reconstructed, and müllerian structures can be removed with the goal of preserving the vas deferens. Replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids must be precisely managed to permit proper growth, and testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone replacement must be carefully considered and managed. A most important element in the care of these patients is the psychological support that first the families and then the patient require. This must be delivered with sensitivity. The proper care of these complex patients requires that the physician be a scientist as well as a clinician and a skilled technician.((PMID:8013361))It is well known that fetal androgens are required for male sexual differentiation, and it is thought that fetal ovaries are not steroidogenically active. However, molecular details, such as which steroidogenic enzymes are present in fetal testes and which enzymes are absent in fetal ovaries, have not been established. The pattern of expression of the genes that encode four of the steroidogenic enzymes necessary for androgen and estrogen production was examined during fetal development in mouse gonads. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4-isomerase (3 beta HSD), P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (P450c17), and P450 aromatase (P450arom) was determined before ovaries and testes were distinguishable (13 days postconception) and during sexual differentiation (15, 17, and 20 days postconception) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). A PCR assay for Sry was used to determine gender on day 13. P450scc, 3 beta HSD, and P450c17 transcripts were detected at all ages in fetal testes, indicating that mRNAs for the steroidogenic enzymes that are required to convert cholesterol to androgens are present in the male gonad even before sexual differentiation. P450arom mRNA was detected in several fetal testes on day 17, but consistently observed on day 20. The expression of P450arom suggests the potential of fetal and neonatal testes to convert androgens to estrogens. In contrast, although 3 beta HSD mRNA was detected in several of the ovaries examined, the detection of P450scc, P450c17, and P450arom transcripts was rare. These data suggest that the absence of fetal ovarian steroid hormone production is the result of lack of expression of at least three of the steroidogenic enzymes, P450scc, P450c17, and P450arom.((PMID:26377202))MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that pave a new avenue for understanding immune responses and cancer progression. Although the miRNAs are involved in breast cancer development, their axis with the transcription factors that show therapeutic potential in breast cancer is largely unknown. Previous studies showed anti-metastatic roles of agonist-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) in various breast cancer cell lines. Recently, we demonstrated that agonist-activated Ahr induced a highly conserved miRNA cluster, named miR-212/132, in murine cellular immune compartment. Therefore, current study was performed to examine if this miRNA cluster mediates the anti-metastatic properties of Ahr agonists.The expression of miR-212/132 cluster and coding genes were examined by real-time PCR, and the protein levels were detected by western blot. The 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) were used to activate Ahr in MDA-MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to identify the binding site(s) for Ahr on miR-212/132 promoter. For prediction of potentially target gene of the miRNA cluster, bioinformatics analysis was carried out, and to test targeting, luciferase activity was quantified. Besides, biological effects of Ahr-miR-212/132 axis were examined in vitro by cell migration, expansion and invasion, and examined in vivo by orthotopic model of spontaneous metastasis.The miR-212/132 cluster was transcriptionally activated in MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells by TCDD and DIM, and this activation was regulated by Ahr. A reciprocal correlation was identified between Ahr agonists-induced miR-212/132 and the pro-metastatic SRY-related HMG-box4 (SOX4), and a new specific binding sites for miR-212/132 were identified on the untranslated region (3'UTR) of SOX4. Interestingly, miR-212/132 over-expression showed direct anti-migration, anti-expansion and anti-invasion properties, and an inhibition of the miRNA cluster mitigated the anti-invasive properties of TCDD and DIM. Further in vivo studies demonstrated that the Ahr-miR-212/132-SOX4 module was induced by Ahr activation.Taken together, the findings provide the first evidences of the synergistic anti-metastatic properties of miR-212/132 cluster through suppression of SOX4. Also, current study suggest a new miRNA-based mechanism elucidating the anti-metastatic properties of Ahr agonists, suggesting possibility of using miR-212/132 to control metastasis in breast cancer patients.((PMID:11850237))Teleost fish are characterized by exceptionally high levels of brain estrogen biosynthesis when compared to the brains of other vertebrates or to the ovaries of the same fish. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) have utility as complementary models for understanding the molecular basis and functional significance of exaggerated neural estrogen biosynthesis. Multiple cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) cDNAs that derive from separate gene loci (cyp19a and cyp19b) are differentially expressed in brain (P450aromB>A) and ovary (P450aromA>B) and have a different developmental program (B>A) and response to estrogen upregulation (B only). As measured by increased P450aromB mRNA, a functional estrogen response system is first detected 24-48 h post-fertilization (hpf), consistent with the onset of estrogen receptor (ER) expression (alpha, beta, and gamma). The 5'-flanking region of the cyp19b gene has a TATA box, two estrogen response elements (EREs), an ERE half-site (ERE1/2), a nerve growth factor inducible-B protein (NGFI-B)/Nur77 responsive element (NBRE) binding site, and a sequence identical to the zebrafish GATA-2 gene neural specific enhancer. The cyp19a promoter region has TATA and CAAT boxes, a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site, and two aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator factor (ARNT) binding motifs. Both genes have multiple potential SRY/SOX binding sites (16 and 8 in cyp19b and cyp19a, respectively). Luciferase reporters have basal promoter activity in GH3 cells, but differences (a>b) are opposite to fish pituitary (b>a). When microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs, a cyp19b promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (but not cyp19a) is expressed in neurons of 30-48 hpf embryos, most prominently in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their projections to optic tectum. Further studies are required to identify functionally relevant cis-elements and cellular factors, and to determine the regulatory role of estrogen in neurodevelopment.((PMID:27068235))Diet and microbiome derived indole derivatives are known to activate the ligand induced transcription factor, the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). While the current understanding of AhR biology has confirmed its role in mucosal lymphocytes, its function in intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) is poorly understood. Here, we report that Cre-mediated deletion of AhR in CD11c-expressing cells in C57/BL6 mice is associated with altered intestinal epithelial morphogenesis in vivo. Moreover, when co-cultured with AhR-deficient DCs ex vivo, intestinal organoids showed reduced SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 and increased Mucin 2 expression, which correlates with reduced Paneth cells and increased goblet cell differentiation, similar to the data obtained in vivo. Further, characterization of intestinal APC subsets, devoid of AhR, revealed an expression pattern associated with aberrant intrinsic Wnt pathway regulation. At a functional level, the loss of AhR in APCs resulted in a dysfunctional epithelial barrier, associated with a more aggressive chemically induced colitis compared to wild type animals. Our results are consistent with a model whereby the AhR signalling pathway may participate in the regulation of innate immunity through intestinal epithelium development and mucosal immunity.((PMID:11738553))Teleost fish are characterized by exceptionally high levels of neural estrogen biosynthesis when compared with the brains of other vertebrates or to the ovaries of the same fish. Two P450arom mRNAs which derive from separate gene loci (cyp19a and cyp19b) are differentially expressed in brain (b>a) and ovary (a>b) and have a different developmental program (b>a) and estrogen upregulation (b only). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genomic walking strategy was used to isolate the 5'-flanking regions of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) cyp19 genes. Sequence analysis of the cyp19b gene approximately 1.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site revealed a TATA box at nucleotide (nt) -30, two estrogen responsive elements (EREs; nt -351 and -211) and a consensus binding site (NBRE) for nerve growth factor inducible-B protein (NGFI-B/Nur77) at -286, which includes another ERE half-site. Also present were a sequence at nt -399 (CCCTCCT) required for neural specificity of the zebrafish GATA-2 gene, and 16 copies of an SRY/SOX binding motif. The 5'-flanking region ( approximately 1.0 kb) of the cyp19a gene had TATA (nt -48) and CAAT (nt -71) boxes, a steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding site (nt -265), eight copies of the SRY/SOX motif, and two copies of a recognition site for binding the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator factor (ARNT) heterodimer. Both genes had elements previously identified in the brain specific exon I promoter of the mouse aromatase gene. Cyp19a- and -b/luciferase constructs showed basal promoter activity in aromatase-expressing rodent pituitary (GH3) cells, but differences (a>b) did not reflect expression in fish pituitary in vivo (b>a), implying a lack of appropriate cell factors. Consistent with the onset of cyp19b expression in zebrafish embryos, microinjection of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid into fertilized eggs revealed labeling in neural tissues at 30-48 h post-fertilization (hpf), most prominently in retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and axon-like projections to the optic tectum. Expression of a cyp19a/GFP reporter was not detectable up to 72 hpf. Tandem analysis of cyp19a and cyp19b promoters in living zebrafish embryos can be a useful approach for identifying cis-elements and cellular factors involved in the correct tissue-specific, spatial, temporal and estrogen regulated expression of aromatase genes during CNS and gonadal development.((PMID:24558194))Intervertebral disc degeneration is the leading cause of chronic back pain. Recent studies show that raised level of SDC4, a cell-surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, plays a role in pathogenesis of disc degeneration. However, in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells of the healthy intervertebral disc, the mechanisms that control expression of SDC4 and its physiological function are unknown. Hypoxia induced SDC4 mRNA and protein expression by ~2.4- and 4.4-fold (P<0.05), respectively, in NP cells. While the activity of the SDC4 promoter containing hypoxia response element (HRE) was induced 2-fold (P<0.05), the HRE mutation decreased the activity by 40% in hypoxia. Transfections with plasmids coding prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) and ShPHD2 show that hypoxic expression of SDC4 mRNA and protein is regulated by PHD2 through controlling hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) levels. Although overexpression of HIF-1α significantly increased SDC4 protein levels, stable suppression of HIF-1α and HIF-1β decreased SDC4 expression by 50% in human NP cells. Finally, suppression of SDC4 expression, as well as HS function, resulted in an ~2-fold increase in sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 (Sox9) mRNA, and protein (P<0.05) and simultaneous increase in Sox9 transcriptional activity and target gene expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that in healthy discs, SDC4, through its HS side chains, contributes to maintenance of the hypoxic tissue niche by controlling baseline expression of Sox9.((PMID:23962688))We report isolation of novel splice variants of chicken Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 3 (cNPAS3) gene distinct from the previously predicted cNPAS3 at the 5' end. Newly identified cNPAS3 splice variants feature N-terminus coding sequences with high degrees of homology to human NPAS3 (hNAPS3). We also show that the alternative splicing pattern of NPAS3 is conserved between chicken and human. RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of cNPAS3 in the developing central nervous system (CNS) is limited to the ventricular zone and only partially overlaps with that of chicken Reelin (cReelin), the only known regulatory target gene of NPAS3 in the adult brain. Overexpression of cNPAS3 by in ovo electroporation had little effect on the expression of Sox2, a marker for neural precursors, or of Isl1/2, a marker for early differentiating motor neurons. Taken together with the little effect of cNPAS3 overexpression on cReelin, it is noted that the function of NPAS3 in the developing CNS remains to be determined. Still, identification of proper cDNA sequences for cNPAS3 should represent a solid beginning of the understanding process.((PMID:18247374))Epidermal keratinocytes respond to extracellular influences by activating cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways that change gene expression. Using pathway-specific transcriptional profiling, we identified the genes regulated by two such pathways, p38 and ERK. These pathways are at the fulcrum of epidermal differentiation, proliferative and inflammatory skin diseases. We used SB203580 and PD98059 as specific inhibitors and Affymetrix Hu133Av2 microarrays, to identify the genes regulated after 1, 4, 24, and 48 h and compared them to genes regulated by JNK. Unexpectedly, inhibition of MAPK pathways is compensated by activation of the NFkappaB pathway and suppression of the DUSP enzymes. Both pathways promote epidermal differentiation; however, there is a surprising disconnect between the expression of steroid synthesis enzymes and differentiation markers. The p38 pathway induces the expression of extracellular matrix and proliferation-associated genes, while suppressing microtubule-associated genes. The ERK pathway induces nuclear envelope and mRNA splicing proteins, while suppressing steroid synthesis and mitochondrial energy production enzymes. Transcription factors SRY, c-FOS, and N-Myc are the principal targets of the p38 pathway, Elk-1 SAP1 and HLH2 of ERK, while FREAC-4, ARNT and USF are shared. The results suggest a list of targets potentially useful in therapeutic interventions in cutaneous diseases and wound healing.((PMID:25908172))This study was aimed to identify the prognostic risk markers for thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC) by bioinformatics. The clinical data of TPC and their microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes expression profile data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Elastic net-Cox's proportional regression hazards model (EN-COX) was used to identify the prognostic associated factors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve were used to screen the significant prognostic risk miRNA and genes. Then, the target genes of the obtained miRNAs were predicted followed by function prediction. Finally, the significant risk genes were performed literature mining and function analysis. Total 1046 miRNAs and 20531 genes in 484 cases samples were identified after data preprocessing. From the EN-COX model, 30 prognostic risk factors were obtained. Based on the 30 risk factors, 3 miRNAs and 11 genes were identified from the ROC and KM curves. The target genes of miRNA-342 such as B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were mainly enriched in the biological process related to cellular metabolic process and Disease Ontology terms of lymphoma. The target genes of miRNA-93 were mainly enriched in the pathway of G1 phase. Among the 11 prognostic risk genes, v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue F (MAFF), SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 4 (SOX4), and retinoic acid receptor, alpha (RARA) encoded transcription factors. Besides, RARA was enriched in four pathways. These prognostic markers such as miRNA-93, miRNA-342, RARA, MAFF, SOX4, and BCL2 may be used as targets for TPC chemoprevention.((PMID:23968773))The molecular mechanisms governing sex determination and differentiation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) are not fully understood. To gain more insights into the function of specific genes in these complex processes, the expression of multiple candidates needs to be assessed, preferably on the protein level. Here, we developed a targeted proteomics method based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to study the candidate sex-related proteins in zebrafish which were selected based on a global proteomics analysis of adult gonads and representational difference analysis of male and female DNA, as well as on published information on zebrafish and other vertebrates. We employed the developed SRM protocols to acquire time-resolved protein expression profiles during the gonad differentiation period in vas::EGFP transgenic zebrafish. Evidence on protein expression was obtained for the first time for several candidate genes previously studied only on the mRNA level or suggested by bioinformatic predictions. Tuba1b (tubulin alpha 1b), initially included in the study as one of the potential housekeeping proteins, was found to be preferentially expressed in the adult testis with nearly absent expression in the ovary. The revealed changes in protein expression patterns associated with gonad differentiation suggest that several of the examined proteins, especially Ilf2 and Ilf3 (interleukin enhancer-binding factors 2 and 3), Raldh3 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type 3), Zgc:195027 (low density lipoprotein-related receptor protein 3) and Sept5a (septin 5a), may play a specific role in the sexual differentiation in zebrafish.((PMID:12554773))Dax-1 [dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (NR0B1)] is an orphan nuclear receptor acting as a suppressor of Ad4 binding protein/steroidogenic factor 1 [Ad4BP/SF-1 (NR5A1)] and as an anti-Sry factor in the process of gonadal sex differentiation. The roles of these nuclear receptors in the differentiation of the gonads and the adrenal cortex have been established through studies of the mutant phenotype in both mice and humans. However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of these genes remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between Dax-1 gene transcription and the Wnt4 pathway. Reporter gene analysis revealed that Dax-1 gene transcription was activated by beta-catenin, a key signal-transducing protein in the Wnt pathway, acting in synergy with Ad4BP/SF-1. Interaction between beta-catenin and Ad4BP/SF-1 was observed using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays. The region of Ad4BP/SF-1 essential for this interaction consists of an acidic amino acid cluster, which resides in the first helix of the ligand-binding domain. Mutation of the amino acid cluster impaired transcriptional activation of Dax-1 as well as interaction of Ad4BP/SF-1 with beta-catenin. These results were supported by in vivo observations using Wnt4 gene-disrupted mice, in which Dax-1 gene expression was decreased significantly in sexually differentiating female gonads. We thus conclude that Wnt4 signaling mediates the increased expression of Dax-1 as the ovary becomes sexually differentiated.((PMID:12675663))The autoantigen SOX-13 of the SRY-related high mobility group box is a low-frequency reactant in sera from patients with Type 1 diabetes. We further investigated the potential diagnostic role of anti-SOX-13, and in particular its ability to distinguish Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes, in two large, well-characterized cohorts.SOX-13 autoantibody status was ascertained using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay in (i) a random sample of 546 participants in an Australian community-based study (the Fremantle Diabetes Study; FDS) of whom 119 had Type 1 and 427 Type 2 diabetes, and (ii) a sample of 333 subjects with Type 2 diabetes from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) stratified by age, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and islet cell antibody (ICA) status, and requirement for insulin therapy within 6 years of diagnosis.The frequencies of anti-SOX-13 in the FDS subjects were 16.0% and 14.8% for Type 1 and Type 2 patients, respectively, and levels were similar. In the UKPDS subjects, the frequency was 4.5%. In a logistic regression model involving demographic, anthropometric and metabolic variables, only diabetes duration was significantly associated with anti-SOX-13 positivity, especially for duration > 5 years (P < 0.002). When the coexistence of autoantibodies was assessed in the two study samples, there were no significant associations between anti-SOX-13 and ICA, anti-GAD or ICA512/IA-2.Whilst the frequency of anti-SOX-13 may be increased in some populations of diabetic patients, this reactivity does not usefully distinguish Type 1 from Type 2 diabetes. However, the association with diabetes duration suggests that anti-SOX-13 may be a non-specific marker of tissue damage associated with chronic hyperglycaemia.((PMID:18523156))SOX17 is a SRY-related high-mobility group (HMG) box transcription factor that is necessary for endoderm formation in multiple species. Despite its essential function during endoderm formation and differentiation, few direct targets of SOX17 are known. To identify targets of SOX17, we isolated SOX17 binding sites with a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-cloning screen. SOX17-ChIP identified zinc finger protein 202 (Zfp202) as a direct target of SOX17 during endoderm differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. A sequence in the first intron of Zfp202 activated transcription in differentiated F9 cells, and overexpression of Sox17 increased the transcriptional activity of this sequence. SOX17 binds to a site within this sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and mutation of this site decreases the transcriptional activation. Zfp202 is induced concomitantly with Sox17 during endoderm differentiation of F9 cells. We also show that ZFP202 represses Hnf4a, which has been reported for the human ortholog ZNF202. Identifying targets of SOX17 will help to elucidate the molecular basis of endoderm differentiation and may provide a better understanding of the role of endoderm in patterning the other germ layers.((PMID:22869781))We recently used three XO male mouse models with varying Y short-arm (Yp) gene complements, analysed at 30 days post partum, to demonstrate a Yp gene requirement for the apoptotic elimination of spermatocytes with a univalent X chromosome at the first meiotic metaphase. The three mouse models were i) XSxr(a)O in which the Yp-derived Tp(Y)1Ct(Sxr-a) sex reversal factor provides an almost complete Yp gene complement, ii) XSxr(b)O,Eif2s3y males in which Tp(Y)1Ct(Sxr-b) has a deletion completely or partially removing eight Yp genes - the Yp gene Eif2s3y has been added as a transgene to support spermatogonial proliferation, and iii) XOSry,Eif2s3y males in which the Sry transgene directs gonad development along the male pathway. In this study, we have used the same mouse models analysed at 6 weeks of age to investigate potential Yp gene involvement in spermiogenesis. We found that all three mouse models produce haploid and diploid spermatids and that the diploid spermatids showed frequent duplication of the developing acrosomal cap during the early stages. However, only in XSxr(a)O males did spermiogenesis continue to completion. Most strikingly, in XOSry,Eif2s3y males, spermatid development arrested at round spermatid step 7 so that no sperm head restructuring or tail development was observed. In contrast, in XSxr(b)O,Eif2s3y males, spermatids with substantial sperm head and tail morphogenesis could be easily found, although this was delayed compared with XSxr(a)O. We conclude that Sxr(a) (and therefore Yp) includes genetic information essential for sperm morphogenesis and that this is partially retained in Sxr(b).((PMID:22626995))Gonads are the only organs with 2 possible developmental pathways, testis or ovary. A consequence of this unique feature is that mutations in genes controlling gonad development give rise not only to gonadal malformation or dysfunction but also to frequent cases of sex reversal, including XY females, XX males and intersexes. Most of our current knowledge on mammalian sex determination, the genetic process by which the gonadal primordia are committed to differentiate as either testes or ovaries, has derived mainly from the study of sex-reversed mice obtained by direct genetic manipulation. However, there are also numerous cases of natural exceptions to normal gonad development which have been described in a variety of mammals, including both domestic and wild species. Here, we review the most relevant cases of: (1) natural, non-induced sex reversal and intersexuality described in laboratory rodents, including Sxr and B6-Y(DOM) mice; (2) sex reversal in domestic animals, including freemartinism in bovids and pigs, XX sex reversal in pigs, goats and dogs, XY sex reversal in the horse, and sex chromosome chimerism and sex reversal in the cat, and (3) sex reversal in wild mammals, including the generalised true hermaphroditism described in talpid moles, XY sex reversal in Akodon, Microtus and Dicrostonyx species, males lacking a Y chromosome and SRY in Ellobius lutescens, the X* chromosome of Myopus schisticolor, and sex chromosome mosaicism and X0 females in Microtus oregoni. These studies are necessary to elucidate particular aspects of mammalian gonad development in some instances and to understand how the genetic mechanisms controlling gonad development have evolved.((PMID:21530259))During male but not female mammalian meiosis, there is efficient apoptotic elimination of cells with unpaired (univalent) chromosomes at the first meiotic metaphase (MI) [1]. Apoptotic elimination of MI spermatocytes is seen in response to the univalent X chromosome of XSxr(a)O male mice [2], in which the X chromosome carries Sxr(a) [3, 4], the Y-chromosome-derived sex-reversal factor that includes the testis determinant Sry. Sxr(b) is an Sxr(a)-derived variant in which a deletion has removed six Y short-arm genes and created a Zfy2/Zfy1 fusion gene spanning the deletion breakpoint [4, 5]. XSxr(b)O males have spermatogonial arrest that can be overcome by the re-addition of Eif2s3y from the deletion as a transgene; however, XSxr(b)OEif2s3y transgenic males do not show the expected elimination of MI spermatocytes in response to the univalent [6]. Here we show that these XSxr(b)OEif2s3y males have an impaired apoptotic response with completion of the first meiotic division, but there is no second meiotic division. We then show that Zfy2 (but not the closely related Zfy1) is sufficient to reinstate the apoptotic response to the X univalent. These findings provide further insight into the basis for the much lower transmission of chromosomal errors originating at the first meiotic division in men than in women [7].((PMID:12036107))Investigations in mice suggest that the Y-chromosomal genes affect certain behaviors. Here, we studied whether a part of the Y chromosome, the Sxr locus, has an effect on induction of motivation for parental care (pup retrieval) or of parental aggression towards pups (infanticide). XX females, XX males with the Sxr locus on the X chromosome, and XY males of the C57BL/6J strain were tested. The induced pup retrieval or infanticide behaviors were genotype-dependent. XX mice always retrieved pups and never were infanticidal. On the first test, significantly more XY males (38%) than XX males (17%) were infanticidal. When the same animals were tested for a second time, all except one of the XX males retrieved pups. Overall, motivation for parental care was highest in XX females, followed by XX males, and lowest in XY mice. On the other hand, the incidence of infanticide was highest in XY males, lower in XX males, and absent in XX females. We conclude that the Sxr locus of the Y chromosome, when operating in a XX background, partially erases but does not fully defeminize motivation for pup retrieval. Further, it induces infanticide to a level higher than that of XX females but significantly lower than that of normal males (XY). Hence, we suggest that genes outside the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome and/or genes on autosomes are necessary for manifestation of full male-type parental behavior.((PMID:9527878))The sex-reversed mutation Sxr results in XX males. In the absence of any other mutations, testis differentiation in XXSxr fetuses is essentially normal and only one report of an XXSxr fetus with ovotestes is in the literature. We report that 84% (21/25) of 13 days postcoitum XXSxr fetuses on the B6 inbred genomic background have ovotestes. Ovotestes were found in fetuses from both Sxra and Sxrb variants. Examination of fetuses older than 13 dpc suggests that the presence of ovotestes is transient in most fetuses. However, one overt hermaphrodite was identified after birth. The development of ovotestes is associated with the inbred background and is exacerbated by the dominant spotting oncogene allele KitW-42J. We propose that spreading of X-inactivation into the Sxr region resulting in loss of Sry expression is more extensive in B6-Sxr strains.((PMID:7479793))We earlier described three lines of sex-reversed XY female mice deleted for sequences believed close to the testes-determining gene (Sry) on the Y chromosome short arm (Yp). The original sex-reversed females appeared among the offspring of XY males that carried the Yp duplication Sxr on their X chromosome. Earlier cytogenetic observations had suggested that the deletions resulted from asymmetrical meiotic recombination between the Y and the homologous Sxr region, but no direct evidence for this hypothesis was available. We have now analyzed the offspring of XSxr/Y males carrying an evolutionarily divergent Mus musculus domesticus Y chromosome, which permits detection and characterization of such recombination events. This analysis has enabled the derivation of a recombination map of Yp and Sxr, also demonstrating the orientation of Yp with respect to the Y centromere. The mapping data have established that Rbm, the murine homologue of a gene family cloned from the human Y chromosome, lies between Sry and the centromere. Analysis of two additional XY female lines shows that asymmetrical Yp-Sxr recombination leading to XY female sex reversal results in deletion of Rbm sequences. The deletions bring Sry closer to Y centromere, consistent with the hypothesis that position-effect inactivation of Sry is the basis for the sex reversal.((PMID:7587380))XYSxr (Sex reversal) mice carry a Y chromosome in which the chromatin (including Sry, the gene for testis determination) that normally resides on the short arm is duplicated and the second copy is relocated to the distal end of the long arm. Multicolor in situ hybridization to mitotic chromosomes of XYSxr males using probes for the telomere repeat sequence (TTAGGG)n and Sry shows that the rearranged chromatin is located distal to the telomeric signal. This suggests that the rearrangement arose from a recombination event involving the distal Y telomere sequences, i.e., within the telomere, a structure historically assumed to be incapable of participating in chromosome rearrangements.((PMID:1684224))The Sxr (sex-reversed) region, a fragment of the Y chromosome short arm, can cause chromosomally female XXSxr or XSxrO mice to develop as sterile males. The original Sxr region, termed Sxra, encodes: Tdy, the primary sex-determining gene; Hya, the controlling or structural locus for the minor transplantation antigen H-Y; gene(s) controlling the expression of the serologically detected male antigen (SDMA); Spy, a gene(s) required for the survival and proliferation of A spermatogonia during spermatogenesis; Zfy-1/Zfy-2, zinc-finger-containing genes of unknown function; and Sry, which is probably identical to Tdy. A deletion variant of Sxra, termed Sxrb, which lacks Hya, SDMA expression, Spy and some Zfy-2 sequences, makes positional cloning of these genes possible. We report here the isolation of a new testis-specific gene, Sby, mapping to the DNA deleted from the Sxrb region (the delta Sxrb interval). Sby has extensive homology to the X-linked human ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. The critical role of this enzyme in nuclear DNA replication together with the testis-specific expression of Sby suggests Sby as a candidate for the spermatogenic gene Spy.((PMID:25535777))Turner Syndrome (TS) is an unfavorable genetic condition with a prevalence of 1:2500 in newborn girls. Prompt and effective diagnosis is very important to appropriately monitor the comorbidities. The aim of the present study was to propose a feasible and practical molecular diagnostic tool for newborn screening by quantifying the gene dosage of the SHOX, VAMP7, XIST, UBA1, and SRY genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in individuals with a diagnosis of complete X monosomy, as well as those with TS variants, and then compare the results to controls without chromosomal abnormalities. According to our results, the most useful markers for these chromosomal variants were the genes found in the pseudoautosomic regions 1 and 2 (PAR1 and PAR2), because differences in gene dosage (relative quantification) between groups were more evident in SHOX and VAMP7 gene expression. Therefore, we conclude that these markers are useful for early detection in aneuploidies involving sex chromosomes.((PMID:18439975))The Y chromosome evolves from an autochromosome and accumulates male-related genes including sex-determining region of Y-chromosome (SRY) and several spermatogenesis-related genes. The human Y chromosome (60 Mb long) is largely composed of repetitive sequences that give it a heterochromatic appearance, and it consists of pseudoautosomal, euchromatic, and heterochromatic regions. Located on the two extremities of the Y chromosome, pseudoautosomal regions 1 and 2 (PAR1 and PAR2, 2.6 Mb and 320 bp long, respectively) are homologs with the termini of the X chromosome. The euchromatic region and some of the repeat-rich heterochromatic parts of the Y chromosome are called "male-specific Y" (MSY), which occupy more than 95% of the whole Y chromosome. After evolution, the Y chromosome becomes the smallest in size with the least number of genes but with the most number of copies of genes that are mostly spermatogenesis-related. The Y chromosome is characterized by highly repetitive sequences (including direct repeats, inverted repeats, and palindromes) and high polymorphism. Several gene rearrangements on the Y chromosome occur during evolution owing to its specific gene structure. The consequences of such rearrangements are not only loss but also gain of specific genes. One hundred and fifty three haplotypes have been discovered in the human Y chromosome. The structure of the Y chromosome in the GenBank belongs to haplotype R1. There are 220 genes (104 coding genes, 111 pseudogenes, and 5 other uncategorized genes) according to the most recent count. The 104 coding genes encode a total of about 48 proteins/protein families (including putative proteins/protein families). Among them, 16 gene products have been discovered in the azoospermia factor region (AZF) and are related to spermatogenesis. It has been discovered that one subset of gene rearrangements on the Y chromosome, "micro-deletions", is a major cause of male infertility in some populations. However, controversies exist about different Y chromosome haplotypes. Six AZFs of the Y chromosome have been discovered including AZFa, AZFb, AZFc, and their combinations AZFbc, AZFabc, and partial AZFc called AZFc/gr/gr. Different deletions in AZF lead to different content spermatogenesis loss from teratozoospermia to infertility in different populations depending on their Y haplotypes. This article describes the structure of the human Y chromosome and investigates the causes of micro-deletions and their relationship with male infertility from the view of chromosome evolution. After analysis of the relationship between AZFc and male infertility, we concluded that spermatogenesis is controlled by a network of genes, which may locate on the Y chromosome, the autochromosomes, or even on the X chromosome. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying male fertility/infertility will facilitate our knowledge of functional genomics.((PMID:23644099))Loss of Abcc6 gene expression was identified to be responsible for dystrophic calcification of the heart (DCC) or vessels after acute injury in several strains of laboratory mice. This calcification shares features with osteogenesis and may involve osteogenic factors. Tissue expression of osteopontin (Opn) and 11 osteogenic transcription factors were studied in vivo in mouse models for DCC and in vitro using luciferase reporter gene assays. Compared with DCC-resistant C57BL/6 mice, a significant increase in Opn transcription was demonstrated in necrotic lesions of both DCC-susceptible C3H/He and B6.C3H(Dyscalc1) congenic mice at day 3 after injury. Significant increases in gene expression were also demonstrated for the transcription factors runt domain-containing transcription factor 2 (Runx2), vitamin D receptor (Vdr), SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 protein, and Nfkb1 in C3H/He mice versus C57BL/6 controls. However, only Runx2 remained significantly increased in the B6.C3H(Dyscalc1) congenic mice, which carry only the Dyscalc1 locus with functional Abcc6 deletion on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Luciferase assay use increased Opn promoter activity, which was demonstrated after overexpression of Runx2. A poly-T stretch insertion was identified to stabilize the binding of Runx2, thus significantly enhancing Opn promoter activity. This Runx2-mediated activation was further enhanced by cotransfection with Vdr. Our data suggest a key role of Runx2 in the regulation of Opn in a model of cardiovascular calcification and demonstrate a synergistic cooperation of Runx2 and Vdr.((PMID:10730588))The hypothesis that the conservation of sex-chromosome-linked genes among placental mammals could be extended to the horse genome was tested using the UCDavis horse-mouse somatic cell hybrid (SCH) panel. By exploiting the fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique to localize an anchor locus, X-inactivation-specific transcript (XIST) on the horse X chromosome, together with the fragmentation and translocation of the X- and Y-chromosome fragments in a somatic cell hybrid panel, we regionally assigned 13 type I and 13 type II (microsatellite) markers to the horse X- and Y-chromosomes. The synteny groups that correspond to horse X- and Y-chromosomes were identified by synteny mapping of sex-specific loci zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX), zinc finger protein Y-linked (ZFY) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) on the SCH panel. A non-pseudoautosomal gene in the human steroid sulfatase (STS) was identified in both X- and Y-chromosome-containing clones. The regional order of the X-linked type I markers examined in this study, from Xp- to Xq-distal, was [STS-X, the voltage-gated chloride channel 4 (CLCN4)], [ZFX, delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2)], XIST, coagulation factor IX (F9) and [biglycan (BGN), equine F18, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)] (precise marker order could not be determined for genes within the same brackets). The order of the Y-linked type I markers was STS-Y, SRY and ZFY These orders are the same arrangements as reported for the human X- and Y-chromosomes, supporting the conservation of genomic organization between the human and the horse sex chromosomes. Regional ordering of X-linked type I and microsatellite markers provides the first integration of type I and type II markers in the horse X chromosome.((PMID:15142992))Estrogen (17beta-estradiol, E2)-deficient aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice develop Sertoli and Leydig cells at puberty. We hypothesized that estrogen, directly or indirectly, regulates genes responsible for somatic cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. ArKO ovaries expressed estrogen receptors alpha and beta, and LH receptor, indices of estrogen responsiveness in the ovary. Wild-type (Wt) and ArKO mice received either E2 or placebo for 3 wk, from 7-10 wk of age. E2 decreased serum FSH and LH and increased uterine weights of 10-wk-old ArKO mice. We measured mRNA expression of Sertoli cell, Sry-like HMG box protein 9 (Sox9); three upstream transcription factors, liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), steroidogenic factor 1, and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome gene 1; and one downstream factor, Müllerian-inhibiting substance. Placebo-treated ArKO ovaries have increased Sox9 (15-fold; P < 0.001), Müllerian-inhibiting substance (2.9-fold), Lrh-1 (7.7-fold), and dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome gene 1 (12-fold) expression compared with Wt at 10 wk. Steroidogenic factor 1 was similar to Wt. Consistent with increased serum T levels and Leydig cells in their ovaries, placebo-treated ArKO ovaries had increased 17alpha-hydroxylase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-3, and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 expression compared with Wt at 10 wk. E2 treatment for 3 wk improved the ovarian phenotype, decreased development of Sertoli cells, decreased the expression of Sox9, Lrh-1, and the steroidogenic enzymes in ArKO ovaries, and induced ovulation in some cases. In conclusion, the expression of the genes regulating somatic cell differentiation is directly or indirectly responsive to estrogen.((PMID:27490115))We aimed to identify the genetic cause in a cohort of 11 unrelated cases and two sisters with 46,XX SRY-negative (ovo)testicular disorders of sex development (DSD).Whole-exome sequencing (n = 9), targeted resequencing (n = 4), and haplotyping were performed. Immunohistochemistry of sex-specific markers was performed on patients' gonads. The consequences of mutation were investigated using luciferase assays, localization studies, and RNA-seq.We identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 mutation, c.274C>T p.(Arg92Trp), in three unrelated patients. The Arg92 residue is highly conserved and located in the Ftz-F1 region, probably involved in DNA-binding specificity and stability. There were no consistent changes in transcriptional activation or subcellular localization. Transcriptomics in patient-derived lymphocytes showed upregulation of MAMLD1, a direct NR5A1 target previously associated with 46,XY DSD. In gonads of affected individuals, ovarian FOXL2 and testicular SRY-independent SOX9 expression observed.We propose NR5A1, previously associated with 46,XY DSD and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency, as a novel gene for 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. We hypothesize that p.(Arg92Trp) results in decreased inhibition of the male developmental pathway through downregulation of female antitestis genes, thereby tipping the balance toward testicular differentiation in 46,XX individuals. In conclusion, our study supports a role for NR5A1 in testis differentiation in the XX gonad.Genet Med advance online publication 04 August 2016Genetics in Medicine (2016); doi:10.1038/gim.2016.118.((PMID:15768398))ff1d is a novel zebrafish FTZ-F1 gene with sequence characteristics indicating similar basic regulatory mechanisms as the previously characterized ff1 based on the presence of an FTZ-F1 box in the DNA binding domain and an interactive domain (I-Box) and an AF-2 in the ligand binding domain. The highest sequence similarity was found between ff1d and ff1b (NR5A4), a gene previously shown to be a functional homolog to the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). The expression pattern of ff1d was comparable to ff1b both in brain and gonads in adults and in the pituitary and interrenal cells in embryos. SF-1 is crucial in mammalian steroidogenesis and in sex determination by regulating the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). In fish, AMH has not been described previously. In this study, we cloned a partial zebrafish AMH. AMH was detected in growing oocytes, the ovarian follicular layer and testicular Sertoli cells, similar to the mammalian pattern, suggesting a conserved role between zebrafish and mammalian AMH. Teleosts lack a gene homolog to SRY, which constitute the universal testis-determining factor in mammalian sex determination. Comparison of sequences and expression patterns indicate that ff1d is a new candidate for sex determination and differentiation in a way similar to SF-1, possibly involving AMH.((PMID:11301594))Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 vs. 15,000. Consequently, each invertebrate gene has been amplified to the maximum of four paralogous genes in vertebrates: the one-to-four rule. When this rule is applied to genes pertinent to gonadal development and differentiation, the following emerged: (i) Two closely related zinc-finger transcription factor genes in invertebrates have been amplified to two paralogous groups in vertebrates. One consisted of EGR1, EGR2, EGR3 and EGR4, whereas the only known paralogue of the other is WT1, which controls the developmental fate of the entire nephric system, and therefore of gonads. Interestingly, EGR1 and WT1 act as antagonists of each other in nephroblastic cells. (ii) SF-1, which controls the fate of two steroid hormone-producing organs, adrenals and gonads, is descended from the invertebrate Ftz-F1 gene, and its only known paralogue is GCNF-1. (iii) The Y-linked SRY, the mammalian testis-determining gene, is a paralogue neither of SOX3 (SRX) nor of SOX9. Its ancient origin suggests that SRY once became extinct in earlier vertebrates, only to revive itself in the mammalian ancestor. (iv) Inasmuch as four paralogues of one invertebrate nuclear receptor gene have differentiated to receptors of androgen, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and progesterone, there should at most be four paralogous estrogen-receptor genes in the vertebrate genome. It is likely that one of them plays a pivotal role in the estrogen-dependent sex-determining mechanism so commonly found among reptiles, amphibians and fish.((PMID:10412365))Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 versus 15,000.

Several genes required for this complex developmental process have now been identified. The genes LIM1, WT1 and FTZ-F1 have been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of the gonads prior to their differentiation as testes or ovaries. Subsequent sex-specific gonadal differentiation appears to be mediated by the SRY and SOX9 genes in the testis, and the DAX-1 gene in the ovary.((PMID:9722168))The sexual phenotype is established in three steps: (1) the sex chromosome constitution; (2) the differentiation of the gonads; and (3) the response of the internal and external genitalia to the hormones produced by the differentiated gonads. Errors that occur at any of these stages can result in defective sexual differentiation. Therefore the investigation of patients with abnormalities of testis development will help elucidate the mechanisms of sex determination and gonadal differentiation. It was in this way that SRY. the primary testis determining gene was identified. De novo mutations in SRY, result in gonadal dysgenesis by disrupting the DNA-binding activity of the SRY protein. However, only 20% of cases of gonadal dysgenesis, are explained by mutations in SRY or its flanking sequences. Therefore, there are several pieces to this puzzle yet to be discovered and it is hoped that mutation analysis of other genes implicated in gonadal development and differentiation may shed some light on aetiology of gonadal dysgenesis in the remaining 80% of cases.((PMID:9707471))Mammals have two genes (SRY and DMT1) for testis formation-androgenesis, an anti-testis gene, DAX1, an anti-Müllerian duct hormone, and steroid sex hormones. Drosophila uses the sex-lethal, transformer, and doublesex genes for sexual differentation and is supposed to lack sex hormones. However, the statement that insects do not have sex hormones loses much of its credibility if one considers (1) the classical endocrinological work on sexual differentiation in the firefly Lampyris and in the hevea tussock moth Orgyia; (2) the recent identification of an androgenic hormone and its role in sex determination in the isopod Armadillidium; (3) the similarity between steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) of mammals and fushi tarazu factor 1 (FTZ-F1) of Drosophila; and (4) the steroidogenic effect of gonadotropins secreted by the brain of female locusts and mosquitoes and of male gypsy moth. In our model, based on data from the literature, ecdysone, when present in high concentrations, might function as an androgenic sex steroid. It is also the precursor of 20-OH-ecdysone, which is the moulting hormone of insects, and in vitellogenic females of many species, the counterpart of estrogens as well. Other gender-specific hormones are likely to exist in the brain-gonad axis.((PMID:8840189))In mammals, the presence of SRY, the sex-determining gene located on the Y chromosome is required to induce the gonadal anlage to differentiate as a testis, whereas its absence leads to the development of an ovary. We report here the characterization by 5' and 3' RACE analysis of several SRY transcripts which are expressed in the ovine male developing gonads. These transcripts were not detected in any other fetal tissues and were expressed only in the genital portion of the urogenital ridge. The temporal profile of SRY expression analyzed by RT-PCR suggests that in the sheep fetus the role of SRY is not limited to initiating Sertoli cell differentiation as in mice. Indeed, SRY transcripts persist after the full differentiation of the testis. In addition to SRY, other genes are known to be involved in mammalian sex determination: Wilms' tumor gene WT-1, steroidogenic factor gene Ftz-F1 (SF-1) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). We investigated the expression patterns of these genes by RT-PCR during fetal development in sheep gonads. Concerning WT-1 and SF-1, our results are consistent with those described in mice where the earliest expression was detected before the sexual differentiation in both sexes. In male, the ontogenesis of AMH transcription corresponds to the seminiferous cords formation (30 dpc). In female, we have observed the presence of SF-1 transcripts from the undifferentiated stage until birth. In addition, P450 aromatase expression is detected from 30 dpc and is correlated with the presence of 17-beta estradiol in sheep ovary. These data reveal significant differences between rodent and ruminant models concerning the sex-determining pathway.((PMID:8645557))During embryogenesis, most organ rudiments differentiate into only one type of organ and functional mutations are normally lethal for the embryo. However, the indifferent gonad has two options, to form either a testis or an ovary, and mutations of this tissue usually produce sex reversal or sterility which is not lethal for the individual. Therefore, gonadal development serves as an excellent model system for investigating questions of cell fate and organogenesis. The studies of human patients showing different types of sex reversal, in combination with the use of transgenic mice and/or gene targeting disruption, have led to the isolation of several genes important for sex development. These include SRY/Sry, encoding the testis-determining factor, Ftz-F1 encoding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) and Wilms' tumor gene (WT-1). However, the mammalian sex differentiation pathway requires the function of a number of additional genes which we are now trying to identify with the help of mRNA differential display technique.((PMID:23583561))The characterisation of the pleiotropic effects of coat colour-associated mutations in mammals illustrates that sensory organs and nerves are particularly affected by disorders because of the shared origin of melanocytes and neurocytes in the neural crest; e.g. the eye-colour is a valuable indicator of disorders in pigment production and eye dysfunctions. Disorders related to coat colour-associated alleles also occur in the skin (melanoma), reproductive tract and immune system. Additionally, the coat colour phenotype of an individual influences its general behaviour and fitness. Mutations in the same genes often produce similar coat colours and pleiotropic effects in different species (e.g., KIT [reproductive disorders, lethality], EDNRB [megacolon] and LYST [CHS]). Whereas similar disorders and similar-looking coat colour phenotypes sometimes have a different genetic background (e.g., deafness [EDN3/EDNRB, MITF, PAX and SNAI2] and visual diseases [OCA2, RAB38, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TRPM1 and TYR]). The human predilection for fancy phenotypes that ignore disorders and genetic defects is a major driving force for the increase of pleiotropic effects in domestic species and laboratory subjects since domestication has commenced approximately 18,000 years ago.((PMID:26943473))The mechanisms linking sleep disordered breathing with impairment of sleep and bone metabolism/architecture are poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of the neuropeptide orexin, a respiratory homeostasis modulator, in growth retardation induced in an upper airway obstructed (AO) rat model.The tracheae of 22-day-old rats were narrowed; AO and sham-control animals were monitored for 5 to 7 w. Growth parameters, food intake, sleep/wake activity, and serum hormones were measured. After euthanasia, growth plate (GP) histology, morphometry, orexin receptors (OXR), and related mediators were analyzed. The effect of dual orexin receptor antagonist (almorexant 300 mg/kg) on sleep and GP histology were also investigated.The AO group slept 32% less; the time spent in slow wave and paradoxical sleep during light period and slow wave activity was reduced. The AO group gained 46% less body weight compared to the control group, despite elevated food intake; plasma ghrelin increased by 275% and leptin level decreased by 44%. The impediment of bone elongation and bone mass was followed by a 200% increase in OX1R and 38% reduction of local GP ghrelin proteins and growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a. Sry-related transcription factor nine (Sox9), a molecule mediating cartilage ossification, was downregulated and the level of transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma was upregulated, explaining the bone architecture abnormalities. Administration of almorexant restored sleep and improved GP width in AO animals.In AO animals, enhanced expression of orexin and OX1R plays a role in respiratory induced sleep and growth abnormalities.((PMID:25720524))Wnt signaling pathway activation plays a critical role in biological processes of tumor progression. SOX9 belongs to the sry-related high-mobility group box (SOX) family and is a key transcription factor in the development and differentiation of multiple cell lineages. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether suppression of Wnt signaling pathway by PPARγ gene affects target SOX9 gene expression. The pEGFP-N1-PPARγ overexpression recombinant plasmid was structured by molecular biology technology. The overexpression plasmid and empty vector pEGFP-N1 were transfected into three types of human gastric cancer cell lines, with different levels of differentiation, MKN-28, SGC-7901 and BGC-823. The PPARγ, β-catenin and SOX9 mRNA levels and proteins were examined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The pEGFP-N1-PPARγ recombinant plasmid was constructed and transfected into MKN-28, SGC-7901 and BGC-823 successfully. High expression of PPARγ (p < 0.05) for transfection recombinant plasmid group induced obviously decreased expression of β-catenin (p < 0.05), whereas SOX9 expression decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared with the transfection empty vector group and normal comparison group. PPARγ can suppress β-catenin expression in Wnt signaling pathway and its downstream effector SOX9 expression in gastric cancer cells.((PMID:23826829))Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent progenitor cells localized in the stromal compartment of the bone marrow (BM). The potential of MSC for mesenchymal differentiation has been well documented in different animal models predominantly on rodents. However, information regarding bovine MSC (bMSC) is limited, and the differentiation potential of bMSC derived from fetal BM remains unknown. In the present study we sought to isolate bMSC from abattoir-derived fetal BM and to characterize the multipotent and differentiation potential under osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic conditions by quantitative and qualitative analyses.Plastic-adherent bMSC isolated from fetal BM maintained a fibroblast-like morphology under monolayer culture conditions. These cells expressed high levels of MSC surface markers (CD73, CD90, and CD105) and low levels of hematopoietic surface markers (CD34 and CD45). Culture of bMSC under osteogenic conditions during a 27-day period induced up-regulation of the osteocalcin (OC) gene expression and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) activity, and promoted mineralization of the matrix. Increasing supplementation levels of ascorbic acid to culture media enhanced osteogenic differentiation of bMSC; whereas, reduction of FBS supplementation compromised osteogenesis. bMSC increased expression of cartilage-specific genes aggrecan (ACAN), collagen 2A1 (COL2A1) and SRY (sex-determining region Y) box 9 (SOX9) at Day 21 of chondrogenic differentiation. Treatment of bMSC with adipogenic factors increased levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (AP2) mRNA and accumulation of lipid vacuoles after 18 days of culture. NANOG mRNA levels in differentiating bMSC were not affected during adipogenic culture; however, osteogenic and chondrogenic conditions induced higher and lower levels, respectively.Our analyses revealed the potential multilineage differentiation of bMSC isolated from abattoir-derived fetal BM. NANOG mRNA pattern in differentiating bMSC varied according to differentiation culture conditions. The osteogenic differentiation of bMSC was affected by ascorbic acid and FBS concentrations in culture media. The simplicity of isolation and the differentiation potential suggest that bMSC from abattoir-derived fetal BM are appropriate candidate for investigating MSC biology and for eventual applications for regenerative therapy.((PMID:23333934))Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a plasticizer with endocrine disrupting properties that is found ubiquitously in the environment as well as in human amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, human milk, semen, and saliva. It is used in the industry to add flexibility to polyvinyl chloride-derived plastics and its wide spread use and presence has resulted in constant human exposure through fetal development and postnatal life. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between phthalate exposures and human reproductive effects in infant and adult populations. The effects of fetal exposure to phthalates on the male reproductive system were unequivocally shown on animal models, principally rodents, in which short term deleterious reproductive effects are well established. By contrast, information on the long term effects of DEHP in utero exposure on gonadal function are scarce, while its potential effects on other organs are just starting to emerge. The present review focuses on these novel findings, which suggest that DEHP exerts more complex and broader disruptive effects on the endocrine system and metabolism than previously thought. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "CSR 2013".((PMID:22531638))Brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) are a small population of cancer cells that exhibit self-renewal, multi-drug resistance, and recurrence properties. We have shown earlier that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists inhibit the expansion of BTSCs in T98G and U87MG glioma. In this study, we analysed the influence of PPARγ agonists on the expression of stemness and differentiation genes in BTSCs.The BTSCs were isolated from T98G and DB29 glioma cells, and cultured in neurobasal medium with epidermal growth factor+basic fibroblast growth factor. Proliferation was measured by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2 H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulphonate) and 3H thymidine uptake assays, and gene expression was analysed by quantitative reverse--transcription PCR and Taqman array. The expression of CD133, SRY box 2, and nanog homeobox (Nanog) was also evaluated by western blotting, immunostaining, and flow cytometry.We found that PPARγ agonists, ciglitazone and 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-ProstaglandinJ(2), inhibited cell viability and proliferation of T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. The PPARγ agonists reduced the expansion of CD133(+) BTSCs and altered the expression of stemness and differentiation genes. They also inhibited Sox2 while enhancing Nanog expression in BTSCs.These findings highlight that PPARγ agonists inhibit BTSC proliferation in association with altered expression of Sox2, Nanog, and other stemness genes. Therefore, targeting stemness genes in BTSCs could be a novel strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma.((PMID:19852756))PBP (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-binding protein) [Med1 (mediator 1)/TRAP220 (thyroid-hormone-receptor-associated protein 220)] is essential for mammary gland development. We established a mammary epithelial cell line with a genotype of PBPLoxP/LoxP by expressing an active form of Notch4. Null mutation of PBP caused severe growth inhibition of the Notch4-immortalized mammary cells. We found that truncated PBP without the two LXXLL motifs could reverse the growth inhibition due to the deficiency of endogenous PBP, indicating that signalling through nuclear receptors is unlikely to be responsible for the growth inhibition as the result of PBP deficiency. Loss of PBP expression was shown to completely ablate the expression of SOX10 [Sry-related HMG (high-mobility group) box gene 10]. The re-expression of SOX10 was capable of reversing the growth inhibition due to PBP deficiency, whereas suppressed expression of SOX10 inhibited the growth of Notch4-immortalized mammary cells. Further studies revealed PBP is directly recruited to the enhancer of the SOX10 gene, indicating that SOX10 is a direct target gene of PBP. We conclude that PBP is essential for the growth of Notch4-immortalized mammary cells by activating SOX10 expression, providing a potential molecular mechanism through which PBP regulates the growth of mammary stem/progenitor cells.((PMID:26109954))MicroRNA-124 contributes to neurogenesis through regulating its targets, but its expression both in the brain of Huntington's disease mouse models and patients is decreased. However, the effects of microRNA-124 on the progression of Huntington's disease have not been reported. Results from this study showed that microRNA-124 increased the latency to fall for each R6/2 Huntington's disease transgenic mouse in the rotarod test. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) staining of the striatum shows an increase in neurogenesis. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha protein levels in the striatum were increased and SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 9 protein level was decreased. These findings suggest that microRNA-124 slows down the progression of Huntington's disease possibly through its important role in neuronal differentiation and survival.((PMID:25049813))The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha protein, encoded by the PPARGC1A gene, plays an important role in energy homeostasis. The genetic variations within the PPARGC1A gene promoter region were scanned in 808 Chinese native bovines belonging to three cattle breeds and yaks. A total of 6 SNPs and one 4 bp insertion variation in the promoter region of the bovine PPARGC1A gene were identified: SNP -259 T>A, -301_-298insCTTT, -915 A>G, -1175 T>G, -1590 C>T, -1665 C>T and -1690 G>A, which are in the binding sites of some important transcription factors: sex-determining region Y (SRY), myeloid-specific zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) and octamer factor 1(Oct-1). It is expected that these polymorphisms may regulate PPARGC1A gene transcription and might have consequences at a regulatory level.((PMID:15699338))Chondrogenesis is a multistep pathway in which multipotential mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) differentiate into chondrocytes. The transcription factor Sox9 (SRY-related high mobility group-Box gene 9) regulates chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage-specific expression of genes, such as Col2a1 (collagen type II alpha1). However, Sox9 expression is detected not only in chondrogenic tissue but also in nonchondrogenic tissues, suggesting the existence of a molecular partner(s) required for Sox9 to control chondrogenesis and chondrogenic gene expression. Here, we report identification of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) as a coactivator for Sox9 during chondrogenesis. Expression of PGC-1alpha is induced at chondrogenesis sites during mouse embryonic limb development and during chondrogenesis in human MSC cultures. PGC-1alpha directly interacts with Sox9 and promotes Sox9-dependent transcriptional activity, suggesting that PGC-1alpha acts as a transcriptional coactivator for Sox9. Consistent with this finding, PGC-1alpha disruption in MSC by small interfering RNA inhibits Col2a1 expression during chondrogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of both PGC-1alpha and Sox9 induced expression of chondrogenic genes, including Col2a1, followed by chondrogenesis in the MSC and developing chick limb. Together, our results suggest a transcriptional mechanism for chondrogenesis that is coordinated by PGC-1alpha.((PMID:25482504))A recent paper demonstrated that decellularized extracellular matrix (DECM) deposited by synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs), especially from fetal donors, could rejuvenate human adult SDSCs in both proliferation and chondrogenic potential, in which expanded cells and corresponding culture substrate (such as DECM) were found to share a mutual reaction in both elasticity and protein profiles (see ref. (1) ). It seems that young DECM may assist in the development of culture strategies that optimize proliferation and maintain "stemness" of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), helping to overcome one of the primary difficulties in MSC-based regenerative therapies. In this paper, the effects of age on the proliferative capacity and differentiation potential of MSCs are reviewed, along with the ability of DECM from young cells to rejuvenate old cells. In an effort to highlight some of the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we discuss age-related changes to extracellular matrix (ECM)'s physical properties and chemical composition.((PMID:11145965))Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is an orphan nuclear receptor that activates the alpha(1)-fetoprotein gene during early liver developmental growth. Here we sought to define better the position of FTF in transcriptional cascades leading to hepatic differentiation. The mouse FTF gene was isolated and assigned to chromosome 1 band E4 (one mFTF pseudogene was also found). Exon/intron mapping shows an mFTF gene structure similar to that of its close homologue SF1, with two more N-terminal exons in the mFTF gene; exon mapping also delimits several FTF mRNA 5'- and 3'-splice variants. The mFTF transcription initiation site was located in adult liver at 238 nucleotides from the first translation initiator codon, with six canonical GATA, E box, and Nkx motifs clustered between -50/-140 base pairs (bp) from the cap site; DNA/protein binding assays also pinpointed an HNF4-binding element at +36 bp and an FTF-binding element at -257 bp. Transfection assays and point mutations showed that the mFTF promoter is activated by GATA, HNF4alpha, FTF, Nkx, and basic helix-loop-helix factors, with marked cooperativity between GATA and HNF4alpha. A tandem GATA/E box activatory motif in the proximal mFTF promoter is strikingly similar to a composite motif coactivated by differentiation inducers in the hematopoietic lineage; a tandem GATA-Nkx motif in the distal mFTF promoter is also similar to a composite motif transducing differentiation signals from transforming growth factor-beta-like receptors in the cardiogenic lineage. Three genes encoding transcription factors critical to early hepatic differentiation, Hnf3beta, Hnf4alpha, and Hnf1alpha, each contain dual FTF-binding elements in their proximal promoters, and all three promoters are activated by FTF in transfection assays. Direct DNA binding action and cooperativity was demonstrated between FTF and HNF3beta on the Hnf3beta promoter and between FTF and HNF4alpha on the Hnf1alpha promoter. These combined results suggest that FTF is an early intermediary between endodermal specification signals and downstream genes that establish and amplify the hepatic phenotype.((PMID:27639079))Biliary-committed progenitor cells (small cholangiocytes, SMCCs) from small bile ducts are more resistant to hepatobiliary injury than large mouse cholangiocytes (LGCCs) from large bile ducts. The definitive endoderm marker, FoxA2 is the key transcriptional factor that regulates cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Our aim was to characterize the translational role of FoxA2 during cholestatic liver injury.mRNA expression in SMCCs and LGCCs was assessed by PCR array analysis. Liver tissues and hepatic stellate cells from PSC and PBC patients were tested by real-time PCR for methylation, senescence and fibrosis markers. Bile duct ligation (BDL) and MDR2 knockout mice (MDR2(-/-) ) were used as animal models of cholestatic liver injury with or without healthy transplanted large or small cholangiocytes.We demonstrated that FoxA2 was notably enhanced in murine liver progenitor cells and SMCCs, and was silenced in human PSC and PBC liver tissues relative to respective controls that are correlated with the epigenetic methylation enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Serum ALT and AST levels in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with SMCCs after BDL showed significant changes compared with vehicle-treated mice, along with improved liver fibrosis. Enhanced expression of FoxA2 was observed in BDL mouse liver after SMCC cell therapy. Furthermore, activation of fibrosis signaling pathways were observed in BDL/MDR2(-/-) mouse liver as well as in isolated hepatic stellate cells by laser capture microdissection, and these signals were recovered along with reduced hepatic senescence and enhanced hepatic stellate cellular senescence after SMCC engraft.The definitive endoderm marker and the positive regulator of biliary development, FoxA2, mediates the therapeutic effect of biliary-committed progenitor cells during cholestatic liver injury.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified a modest frequency of FOXA2 mutations in endometrioid endometrial cancers (EEC). The current study sought to determine the relationship between FOXA2 mutation and clinicopathologic features in EEC and FOXA2 expression.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing were used to identify mutations in 542 EEC. Western blot, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess expression. Methylation analysis was performed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and sequencing. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Student's t- and log-rank tests were performed.Fifty-one mutations were identified in 49 tumors (9.4% mutation rate). The majority of mutations were novel, loss of function (LOF) (78.4%) mutations, and most disrupted the DNA-binding domain (58.8%). Six recurrent mutations were identified. Only two tumors had two mutations and there was no evidence for FOXA2 allelic loss. Mutation status was associated with tumor grade and not associated with survival outcomes. Methylation of the FOXA2 promoter region was highly variable. Most tumors expressed FOXA2 at both the mRNA and protein level. In those tumors with mutations, the majority of cases expressed both alleles.FOXA2 is frequently mutated in EEC. The pattern of FOXA2 mutations and expression in tumors suggests complex regulation and a haploinsufficient or dominant-negative tumor suppressor function. In vitro studies may shed light on how mutations in FOXA2 affect FOXA2 pioneer and/or transcription factor functions in EEC.((PMID:27404023))Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is a key component of high density lipoproteins which possess anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Insulin is a crucial mediator of the glucose and lipid metabolism that has been implicated in atherosclerotic and inflammatory processes. Important mediators of insulin signaling such as Liver X Receptors (LXRs) and Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) are known to regulate apoA-I expression in liver. Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a well-known target of insulin signaling and a key mediator of oxidative stress response. Low doses of insulin were shown to activate apoA-I expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. However, the detailed mechanisms for these processes are still unknown. We studied the possible involvement of FOXO1, FOXA2, LXRα, and LXRβ transcription factors in the insulin-mediated regulation of apoA-I expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with high doses of insulin (48 h, 100 nM) suppresses apoA-I gene expression. siRNAs against FOXO1, FOXA2, LXRβ, or LXRα abrogated this effect. FOXO1 forms a complex with LXRβ and insulin treatment impairs FOXO1/LXRβ complex binding to hepatic enhancer and triggers its nuclear export. Insulin as well as LXR ligand TO901317 enhance the interaction between FOXA2, LXRα, and hepatic enhancer. These data suggest that high doses of insulin downregulate apoA-I gene expression in HepG2 cells through redistribution of FOXO1/LXRβ complex, FOXA2, and LXRα on hepatic enhancer of apoA-I gene. J.

Whole genome analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that temporal cortical gene expression differs between TLE patients with high vs. low baseline seizure frequency.Baseline seizure frequency was used as a clinical measure of epileptogenicity. Twenty-four patients in high or low seizure frequency groups (median seizures/month) underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy for intractable TLE. RNA was isolated from the lateral temporal cortex and submitted for expression analysis. Genes significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency on likelihood ratio test were identified based on >0.90 area under the ROC curve, P value of <0.05.Expression levels of forty genes were significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency. Of the seven most significant, four have been linked to other neurologic diseases. Expression levels associated with high seizure frequency included low expression of Homeobox A10, Forkhead box A2, Lymphoblastic leukemia derived sequence 1, HGF activator, Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain containing 11, Thanatos-associated protein domain containing 8 and Heparin sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 3A1.This study describes novel associations between forty known genes and a clinical marker of epileptogenicity, baseline seizure frequency. Four of the seven discussed have been previously related to other neurologic diseases. Future investigation of these genes could establish new biomarkers for predicting epileptogenicity, and could have significant implications for diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as epilepsy pathogenesis.((PMID:27322206))Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Better understanding of pancreatic cancer biology may help identify new oncotargets towards more effective therapies. This study investigated the mechanistic actions of microRNA-1291 (miR-1291) in the suppression of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our data showed that miR-1291 was downregulated in a set of clinical pancreatic carcinoma specimens and human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Restoration of miR-1291 expression inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-1291 sharply suppressed the tumorigenicity of PANC-1 cells in mouse models. A proteomic profiling study revealed 32 proteins altered over 2-fold in miR-1291-expressing PANC-1 cells that could be assembled into multiple critical pathways for cancer. Among them anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) was reduced to the greatest degree. Through computational and experimental studies we further identified that forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), a transcription factor governing AGR2 expression, was a direct target of miR-1291. These results connect miR-1291 to the FOXA2-AGR2 regulatory pathway in the suppression of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, providing new insight into the development of miRNA-based therapy to combat pancreatic cancer.((PMID:27153842))Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols (TG) within lysosomes to mobilise NEFA and cholesterol. Since LAL-deficient (Lal (-/-) ) mice suffer from progressive loss of adipose tissue and severe accumulation of lipids in hepatic lysosomes, we hypothesised that LAL deficiency triggers alternative energy pathway(s).We studied metabolic adaptations in Lal (-/-) mice.Despite loss of adipose tissue, Lal (-/-) mice show enhanced glucose clearance during insulin and glucose tolerance tests and have increased uptake of [(3)H]2-deoxy-D-glucose into skeletal muscle compared with wild-type mice. In agreement, fasted Lal (-/-) mice exhibit reduced glucose and glycogen levels in skeletal muscle. We observed 84% decreased plasma leptin levels and significantly reduced hepatic ATP, glucose, glycogen and glutamine concentrations in fed Lal (-/-) mice. Markedly reduced hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations decrease the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) target genes. However, treatment of Lal (-/-) mice with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate further decreased plasma TG (and hepatic glucose and glycogen) concentrations in Lal (-/-) mice. Depletion of hepatic nuclear factor 4α and forkhead box protein a2 in fasted Lal (-/-) mice might be responsible for reduced expression of microsomal TG transfer protein, defective VLDL synthesis and drastically reduced plasma TG levels.Our findings indicate that neither activation nor inactivation of PPARα per se but rather the availability of hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations regulates VLDL synthesis and subsequent metabolic adaptations in Lal (-/-) mice. We conclude that decreased plasma VLDL production enhances glucose uptake into skeletal muscle to compensate for the lack of energy supply.((PMID:27121852))Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D) have discovered a number of loci that contribute to susceptibility to the disease. Future challenges include elucidation of functional mechanisms through which these GWAS-identified loci modulate T2D disease risk. The aim of the present study was to comprehensively characterize T2D associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes through computational approaches.Computational biology approaches used in the present study included comparative genomic analyses and functional annotation using GWAS3D and RegulomeDB, investigation of the effects of T2D-associated SNPs on miRNA binding and protein phosphorylation, and gene ontology, pathway enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional module analysis of T2D-associated genes from previously published GWAS.Computational analysis identified a number of T2D GWAS-associated SNPs that were located at protein binding sites, including CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), E1A binding protein p300 (EP300), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4A), transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2), forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and A2 (FOXA2), and potentially affected the binding of miRNAs and protein phosphorylation. Pathway enrichment analysis confirmed two well-known maturity onset diabetes of the young and T2D pathways, whereas PPI network analysis identified highly interconnected "hub" genes, such as TCF7L2, melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B), and solute carrier family 30 (zinc transporter), member 8 (SLC30A8), that created two tight subnetworks.The results provide objectives and clues for future experimental studies and further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of T2D.((PMID:26855178))Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 transcription factors (HNF1α/β) are associated with diabetes. These factors are well studied in the liver, pancreas and kidney, where they direct tissue-specific gene regulation. However, they also have an important role in the biology of many other tissues, including the intestine. We investigated the transcriptional network governed by HNF1 in an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco2). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify HNF1 binding sites genome-wide. Direct targets of HNF1 were validated using conventional ChIP assays and confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1, followed by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology process enrichment analysis of the HNF1 targets identified multiple processes with a role in intestinal epithelial cell function, including properties of the cell membrane, cellular response to hormones, and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Approximately 50% of HNF1 binding sites were also occupied by other members of the intestinal transcriptional network, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). Depletion of HNF1 in Caco2 cells increases FOXA2 abundance and decreases levels of CDX2, illustrating the coordinated activities of the network. These data suggest that HNF1 plays an important role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function, both directly and through interactions with other intestinal transcription factors.((PMID:26713283))The transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β or transcription factor 3β), has been found to play pivotal roles in multiple phases of mammalian life, from the early development to the organofaction, and subsequently in homeostasis and metabolism in the adult. In the embryonic development period, FOXA2 is require d for the formation of the primitive node and notochord, and its absence results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, FOXA2 plays an important role not only in lung development, but also in T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia. In this article, the role of FOXA2 in lung development and Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation, as well as in goblet cell hyperplasia, is reviewed. FOXA2 deletion in airway epithelium results into Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in developing lung. Leukotriene pathway and signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 pathway may mediate this inflammation through recruitment and activation of denditric cell during lung developments. FOXA2 is a potential treatment target for lung diseases with Th2 inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.((PMID:26644349))Group IVA phospholipase A2 [cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α)] is a key mediator of inflammation and tumorigenesis. In this study, by using a combination of chemical inhibition and genetic approaches in zebrafish and murine cells, we identify a mechanism by which cPLA2α promotes cell proliferation. We identified 2 cpla2α genes in zebrafish, cpla2αa and cpla2αb, with conserved phospholipase activity. In zebrafish, loss of cpla2α expression or inhibition of cpla2α activity diminished G1 progression through the cell cycle. This phenotype was also seen in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mesangial cells. G1 progression was rescued by the addition of arachidonic acid or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indicating a phospholipase-dependent mechanism. We further show that PGE2, through PI3K/AKT activation, promoted Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) phosphorylation and FOXO1 nuclear export. This led to up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p27(Kip1), thus promoting G1 progression. Finally, using pharmacologic inhibitors, we show that cPLA2α, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways cooperatively regulate G1 progression in response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation. In summary, these data indicate that cPLA2α, through its phospholipase activity, is a critical effector of G1 phase progression through the cell cycle and suggest that pharmacological targeting of this enzyme may have important therapeutic benefits in disease mechanisms that involve excessive cell proliferation, in particular, cancer and proliferative glomerulopathies.((PMID:26574435))Growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation is crucial in liver regeneration and the recovery of liver function after injury. The nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), is a key transcription factor for the xenobiotic-induced expression of genes associated with various liver functions. Recently, we reported that PXR activation stimulates xenobiotic-induced hepatocyte proliferation. In the present study, we investigated whether PXR activation also stimulates growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation. In G0 phase-synchronized, immortalized mouse hepatocytes, serum or epidermal growth factor treatment increased cell growth and this growth was augmented by the expression of mouse PXR and co-treatment with pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a PXR ligand. In a liver regeneration model using carbon tetrachloride, PCN treatment enhanced the injury-induced increase in the number of Ki-67-positive nuclei as well as Ccna2 and Ccnb1 mRNA levels in wild-type (WT) but not Pxr-null mice. Chronological analysis of this model demonstrated that PCN treatment shifted the maximum cell proliferation to an earlier time point and increased the number of M-phase cells at those time points. In WT but not Pxr-null mice, PCN treatment reduced hepatic mRNA levels of genes involved in the suppression of G0/G1- and G1/S-phase transition, e.g. Rbl2, Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b. Analysis of the Rbl2 promoter revealed that PXR activation inhibited its Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)-mediated transcription. Finally, the PXR-mediated enhancement of hepatocyte proliferation was inhibited by the expression of dominant active FOXO3 in vitro. The results of the present study suggest that PXR activation stimulates growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation in mice, at least in part, through inhibiting FOXO3 from accelerating cell-cycle progression.((PMID:26564177))'Glucotoxicity' is a term used to convey the negative effect of hyperglycaemia on beta cell function; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that impair insulin secretion and gene expression are poorly defined. Our objective was to define the role of transcription factor v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue 1 (Ets-1) in beta cell glucotoxicity.Primary islets and Min6 cells were exposed to high glucose and Ets-1 expression was measured. Recombinant adenovirus and transgenic mice were used to upregulate Ets-1 expression in beta cells in vitro and in vivo, and insulin secretion was assessed. The binding activity of H3/H4 histone on the Ets-1 promoter, and that of forkhead box (FOX)A2, FOXO1 and Ets-1 on the Pdx-1 promoter was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR assay.High glucose induced upregulation of Ets-1 expression and hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4 at the Ets-1 gene promoter in beta cells. Ets-1 overexpression dramatically suppressed insulin secretion and biosynthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, Ets-1 overexpression increased the activity of FOXO1 but decreased that of FOXA2 binding to the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) homology region 2 (PH2), resulting in inhibition of Pdx-1 promoter activity and downregulation of PDX-1 expression and activity. In addition, high glucose promoted the interaction of Ets-1 and FOXO1, and the activity of Ets-1 binding to the Pdx-1 promoter. Importantly, PDX-1 overexpression reversed the defect in pancreatic beta cells induced by Ets-1 excess, while knockdown of Ets-1 prevented hyperglycaemia-induced dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells.Our observations suggest that Ets-1 links glucotoxicity to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction through inhibiting PDX-1 expression in type 2 diabetes.((PMID:26517695))Cellular metabolism is increasingly recognized as a controller of immune cell fate and function. MicroRNA-33 (miR-33) regulates cellular lipid metabolism and represses genes involved in cholesterol efflux, HDL biogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. Here, we determined that miR-33-mediated disruption of the balance of aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation instructs macrophage inflammatory polarization and shapes innate and adaptive immune responses. Macrophage-specific Mir33 deletion increased oxidative respiration, enhanced spare respiratory capacity, and induced an M2 macrophage polarization-associated gene profile. Furthermore, miR-33-mediated M2 polarization required miR-33 targeting of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not cholesterol efflux. Notably, miR-33 inhibition increased macrophage expression of the retinoic acid-producing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2 (ALDH1A2) and retinal dehydrogenase activity both in vitro and in a mouse model. Consistent with the ability of retinoic acid to foster inducible Tregs, miR-33-depleted macrophages had an enhanced capacity to induce forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression in naive CD4(+) T cells. Finally, treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with miR-33 inhibitors for 8 weeks resulted in accumulation of inflammation-suppressing M2 macrophages and FOXP3(+) Tregs in plaques and reduced atherosclerosis progression. Collectively, these results reveal that miR-33 regulates macrophage inflammation and demonstrate that miR-33 antagonism is atheroprotective, in part, by reducing plaque inflammation by promoting M2 macrophage polarization and Treg induction.((PMID:26507166))Mucus hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia are common features that characterize asthma. IL-13 increases mucin (MUC) 5AC, the major component of airway mucus, in airway epithelial cells. According to the literature, IL-13 receptor activation leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1) gene expression, associated with the induction of MUC5AC. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of heme to biliverdin, and has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. We examined the effects of HO-1 on mucin production and goblet cell hyperplasia induced by IL-13. Moreover, we assessed the cell signaling intermediates that appear to be responsible for mucin production. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were grown at air liquid interface (ALI) in the presence or absence of IL-13 and hemin, a HO-1 inducer, for 14 days. Protein concentration was analyzed using ELISA, and mRNA expression was examined by real-time PCR. Histochemical analysis was performed using HE staining, andWestern blotting was performed to evaluate signaling transduction pathway. Hemin (4 μM) significantly increased HO-1 protein expression (p b 0.01) and HO-1 mRNA expression (p b 0.001). IL-13 significantly increased goblet cells, MUC5AC protein secretion (p b 0.01) and MUC5AC mRNA (p b 0.001), and these were decreased by hemin by way of HO-1. Tin protoporphyrin (SnPP)-IX, a HO-1 inhibitor, blocked the effect of hemin restoring MUC5AC protein secretion (p b 0.05) and goblet cell hyperplasia. Hemin decreased the expression of CLCA1 mRNA (p b 0.05) and it was reversed by SnPP-IX, but could not suppress IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT6 or SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) and Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) mRNA expression. In summary, HO-1 overexpression suppressed IL-13-induced goblet cell hyperplasia and MUC5AC production, and involvement of CLCA1 in the mechanism was suggested.((PMID:26494966))To show the efficient generation of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) differentiated from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of rats.Hepatic differentiation was achieved using a three-step protocol with several growth factors. First, rat iPSCs were differentiated into definitive endoderm cells using Activin A and Wnt3a treatment. Then fibroblast growth factor 4 and bone morphogenetic protein 2 were added to the culture medium and used to induce hepatic differentiation. Finally, hepatocyte growth factor, Oncostatin M and dexamethasone were used for hepatic maturation. The liver-related markers and functions of HLCs were assessed at the gene and protein levels.After endodermal induction, the differentiated cells expressed endodermal markers forkhead box protein A2 and SRY-box containing gene 17 at the mRNA and protein levels. After 20 d of culture, the iPSCs were differentiated into HLCs. These differentiated cells expressed hepatic markers including α-fetoprotein, albumin CK8, CK18, CK19, and transcription factor HNF-4α. In addition, the cells expressed functional proteins such as α1-antitrypsin, cytochrome P450 1A2 and CYP 3A4. They acted like healthy hepatic cells, storing glycogen and taking up indocyanine green and low-density lipoproteins. Also, the rates of urea synthesis (20 d 1.202 ± 0.080 mg/dL vs 0 d 0.317 ± 0.021 mg/dL, P < 0.01) and albumin secretion (20 d 1.601 ± 0.102 mg/dL vs 0 d 0.313 ± 0.015 mg/dL, P < 0.01) increased significantly as differentiation progressed.Rat iPSCs can differentiate into HLCs rapidly and efficiently. These differentiated cells may be an attractive resource for treatment of end-stage liver disease.((PMID:26423870))Hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (such as human embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) are expected to be utilized in drug screening. However, the hepatocyte differentiation efficiency and hepatic functions of hepatocyte-like cells were not sufficient to perform ES/iPS cell-based drug discovery. Therefore, we decided to improve the method of hepatocyte differentiation from human ES/iPS cells. To enhance this hepatocyte differentiation efficiency, hepatocyte-related transcription factors, such as forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α), were overexpressed during the hepatocyte differentiation process. In addition, to enhance the functions of hepatocyte-like cells, these cells were cultured in three dimensional (3D) conditions using a Nanopillar plate. By FOXA2 and HNF1α overexpression, human ES/iPS cells could efficiently (more than 80%) differentiate into albumin-positive hepatocyte-like cells. Various hepatic functions, including albumin secretion and drug metabolism capacities, of the hepatocyte-like cells were significantly enhanced by performing 3D cell culture. These results suggest that the method of hepatocyte differentiation could be improved by using gene transfer and 3D cell culture technologies. We believe that these new hepatocyte-like cells would be useful tools in drug development.((PMID:26157580))The enterohormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is required to amplify glucose-induced insulin secretion that facilitates peripheral glucose utilisation. Alteration in GLP-1 secretion during obesity has been reported but is still controversial. Due to the high adaptability of intestinal cells to environmental changes, we hypothesised that the density of GLP-1-producing cells could be modified by nutritional factors to prevent the deterioration of metabolic condition in obesity. We quantified L-cell density in jejunum samples collected during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in forty-nine severely obese subjects analysed according to their fat consumption. In mice, we deciphered the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet (HFD) makes an impact on enteroendocrine cell density and function. L-cell density in the jejunum was higher in obese subjects consuming >30 % fat compared with low fat eaters. Mice fed a HFD for 8 weeks displayed an increase in GLP-1-positive cells in the jejunum and colon accordingly to GLP-1 secretion. The regulation by the HFD appears specific to GLP-1-producing cells, as the number of PYY (peptide YY)-positive cells remained unchanged. Moreover, genetically obese ob/ob mice did not show alteration of GLP-1-positive cell density in the jejunum or colon, suggesting that obesity per se is not sufficient to trigger the mechanism. The higher L-cell density in HFD-fed mice involved a rise in L-cell terminal differentiation as witnessed by the increased expression of transcription factors downstream of neurogenin3 (Ngn3). We suggest that the observed increase in GLP-1-positive cell density triggered by high fat consumption in humans and mice might favour insulin secretion and therefore constitute an adaptive response of the intestine to balance diet-induced insulin resistance.((PMID:26138366))Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood. Here we studied 60 RMSs using whole-exome/-transcriptome sequencing, copy number (CN) and DNA methylome analyses to unravel the genetic/epigenetic basis of RMS. On the basis of methylation patterns, RMS is clustered into four distinct subtypes, which exhibits remarkable correlation with mutation/CN profiles, histological phenotypes and clinical behaviours. A1 and A2 subtypes, especially A1, largely correspond to alveolar histology with frequent PAX3/7 fusions and alterations in cell cycle regulators. In contrast, mostly showing embryonal histology, both E1 and E2 subtypes are characterized by high frequency of CN alterations and/or allelic imbalances, FGFR4/RAS/AKT pathway mutations and PTEN mutations/methylation and in E2, also by p53 inactivation. Despite the better prognosis of embryonal RMS, patients in the E2 are likely to have a poor prognosis. Our results highlight the close relationships of the methylation status and gene mutations with the biological behaviour in RMS.((PMID:25995156))It has been shown that acetylcholine is both a neurotransmitter and acts as a local mediator, produced by airway cells including epithelial cells. In vivo studies have demonstrated an indirect role for acetylcholine in epithelial cell differentiation. Here, we aimed to investigate direct effects of endogenous non-neuronal acetylcholine on epithelial cell differentiation.Human airway epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI). Cells were exposed to the muscarinic antagonist tiotropium (10 nM), interleukin (IL)-13 (1, 2 and 5 ng/mL), or a combination of IL-13 and tiotropium, during or after differentiation at the ALI.Human airway epithelial cells expressed all components of the non-neuronal cholinergic system, suggesting acetylcholine production. Tiotropium had no effects on epithelial cell differentiation after air exposure. Differentiation into goblet cells was barely induced after air exposure. Therefore, IL-13 (1 ng/mL) was used to induce goblet cell metaplasia. IL-13 induced MUC5AC-positive cells (5-fold) and goblet cells (14-fold), as assessed by histochemistry, and MUC5AC gene expression (105-fold). These effects were partly prevented by tiotropium (47-92%). Goblet cell metaplasia was induced by IL-13 in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by tiotropium. In addition, tiotropium reversed goblet cell metaplasia induced by 2 weeks of IL-13 exposure. IL-13 decreased forkhead box protein A2 (FoxA2) expression (1.6-fold) and increased FoxA3 (3.6-fold) and SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) (5.2-fold) expression. Tiotropium prevented the effects on FoxA2 and FoxA3, but not on SPDEF.We demonstrate that tiotropium has no effects on epithelial cell differentiation after air exposure, but inhibits and reverses IL-13-induced goblet cell metaplasia, possibly via FoxA2 and FoxA3. This indicates that non-neuronal acetylcholine contributes to goblet cell differentiation by a direct effect on epithelial cells.((PMID:25921584))The forkhead box A (FOXA) family of pioneer transcription factors is critical for the development of many endoderm-derived tissues. Their importance in regulating biological processes in the lung and liver is extensively characterized, though much less is known about their role in intestine. Here we investigate the contribution of FOXA2 to coordinating intestinal epithelial cell function using postconfluent Caco2 cells, differentiated into an enterocyte-like model. FOXA2 binding sites genome-wide were determined by ChIP-seq and direct targets of the factor were validated by ChIP-qPCR and siRNA-mediated depletion of FOXA1/2 followed by RT-qPCR. Peaks of FOXA2 occupancy were frequent at loci contributing to gene ontology pathways of regulation of cell migration, cell motion, and plasma membrane function. Depletion of both FOXA1 and FOXA2 led to a significant reduction in the expression of multiple transmembrane proteins including ion channels and transporters, which form a network that is essential for maintaining normal ion and solute transport. One of the targets was the adenosine A2B receptor, and reduced receptor mRNA levels were associated with a functional decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP. We also observed that 30% of FOXA2 binding sites contained a GATA motif and that FOXA1/A2 depletion reduced GATA-4, but not GATA-6 protein levels. These data show that FOXA2 plays a pivotal role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function. Moreover, that the FOXA and GATA families of transcription factors may work cooperatively to regulate gene expression genome-wide in the intestinal epithelium.((PMID:27653037))G6PC2 encodes an islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. G6PC2 forms a substrate cycle with glucokinase that determines the glucose sensitivity of insulin secretion. Consequently, deletion of G6pc2 lowers fasting blood glucose (FBG) without affecting fasting plasma insulin. While chronic elevation of FBG is detrimental to health, glucocorticoids induce G6PC2 expression suggesting that G6PC2 evolved to transiently modulate FBG under conditions of glucocorticoid-related stress. We show using competition and mutagenesis experiments, that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) induces G6PC2 promoter activity through a mechanism involving displacement of the islet-enriched transcription factor MafA by the glucocorticoid receptor. The induction of G6PC2 promoter activity by Dex is modulated by a single nucleotide polymorphism, previously linked to altered FBG in humans, that affects FOXA2 binding. A 5 day repeated injection paradigm was used to examine the chronic effect of Dex on FBG and glucose tolerance in WT and G6pc2 KO mice. Acute Dex treatment only induces G6pc2 expression in 129SvEv but not C57BL/6J mice but this chronic treatment induced G6pc2 expression in both. In 6 hr fasted C57BL/6J wild type (WT) mice, Dex treatment lowered FBG and improved glucose tolerance, with G6pc2 deletion exacerbating the decrease in FBG and enhancing the improvement in glucose tolerance. In contrast, in 24 hr fasted C57BL/6J WT mice, Dex treatment raised FBG but still improved glucose tolerance, with G6pc2 deletion limiting the increase in FBG and enhancing the improvement in glucose tolerance. These observations demonstrate that G6pc2 modulates the complex effects of Dex on both FBG and glucose tolerance.((PMID:27599506))We show characteristic morphological changes corresponding to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program fulfillment in PANC1 cell line stimulated with TGFβ1. Our results support downregulation of E-cadherin protein. We show 5- and 28-fold increase in SNAI1 and SNAI2 expression levels and 25- and 15-fold decrease in CDH1 and KRT8 expression levels, respectively, which confirms the EMT-program fulfillment. We demonstrate downregulation of expression of pancreatic master genes SOX9, FOXA2, and GATA4 (2-, 5-, and 4-fold, respectively) and absence of significant changes in HES1, NR5A2, and GATA6 expression levels in the cells stimulated with TGFβ1. Our results indicate the absence of induction of expression of PTF1A, PDX1, HNF1b, NEUROG3, RPBJL, NKX6.1, and ONECUT1 genes, which are inactive in PANC1 cell line after the EMT stimulated by TGFβ1.((PMID:27586588))Barrett's oesophagus (BO), an intestinal-type metaplasia (IM), typically arising in conjunction with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, is a prominent risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). The molecular similarities between IM and normal intestinal tissues are ill-defined. Consequently, the contribution of intestine-enriched factors expressed within BO to oncogenesis is unclear. Herein, using transcriptomics we define the intestine-enriched genes expressed in meta-profiles of BO and OAC. Interestingly, 77% of the genes differentially expressed in a meta-profile of BO were similarly expressed in intestinal tissues. Furthermore, 85% of this intestine-like signature was maintained upon transition to OAC. Gene networking analysis of transcription factors within this signature revealed a network centred upon NR5A2, GATA6 and FOXA2, whose over-expression was determined in a cohort of BO and OAC patients. Simulated acid reflux was observed to induce the expression of both NR5A2 and GATA6. Using siRNA-mediated silencing and an NR5A2 antagonist we demonstrate that NR5A2-mediated cancer cell survival is facilitated through augmentation of GATA6 and anti-apoptotic factor BCL-XL levels. Abrogation of NR5A2-GATA6 expression in conjunction with BCL-XL co-silencing resulted in synergistically increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and photo-dynamic therapeutics. These findings characterize the intestine-like signature associated with IM which may have important consequences to adenocarcinogenesis.((PMID:27578787))Cell fate specification depends on transcriptional activation driven by lineage-specific transcription factors as well as changes in chromatin organization. To date, the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin modifiers during development is not well understood. We focus here on the initiation of the pancreatic program from multipotent endodermal progenitors. Transcription factors that play key roles in regulating pancreatic progenitor state have been identified, but the chromatin regulators that help establishing and maintaining pancreatic fate are less well known. Using a comparative approach, we identify a critical role for the histone methyltransferase Setd7 in establishing pancreatic cell identity. We show that Setd7 is expressed in the prospective pancreatic endoderm of Xenopus and mouse embryos prior to Pdx1 induction. Importantly, we demonstrate that setd7 is sufficient and required for pancreatic cell fate specification in Xenopus Functional and biochemical approaches in Xenopus and mouse endoderm support that Setd7 modulates methylation marks at pancreatic regulatory regions, possibly through interaction with the transcription factor Foxa2. Together, these results demonstrate that Setd7 acts as a central component of the transcription complex initiating the pancreatic program.((PMID:27576578))Recently, the US FDA has approved "vagal blocking therapy or vBLoc® therapy" as a new treatment for obesity. The aim of the present study was to study the mechanism-of-action of "VBLOC" in rat models.Rats were implanted with VBLOC, an intra-abdominal electrical device with leads placed around gastric vagal trunks through an abdominal incision and controlled by wireless device. Body weight, food intake, hunger/satiety, and metabolic parameters were monitored by a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Brain-gut responses were analyzed physiologically.VBLOC reduced body weight and food intake, which was associated with increased satiety but not with decreased hunger. Brain activities in response to VBLOC included increased gene expression of leptin and CCKb receptors, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor, and transforming growth factor β1 in the brainstem; increased CCK, somatostatin, and tyrosine hydroxylase in the hippocampus; increased NPY, AgRP, and Foxa2 in the hypothalamus; and reduced CCKb receptor, melanocortin 4 receptor, and insulin receptor in the hypothalamus. Plasma concentrations of CCK, gastrin, glucagon, GLP-1, and PYY and gastric acid secretion were unchanged in response to VBLOC.Based on the present study, we may suggest that VBLOC induces satiety through vagal signaling, leading to reduced food intake and loss of body weight.((PMID:27512998))Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. To understand the molecular mechanisms of the disease, an in vitro model is important. In the 1990s, we used the SV40 large T antigen to immortalize dopaminergic neurons derived from Embryonic Day 14 rat mesencephalon. We selected a clone for its high expression of dopaminergic neuron markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and we named it 1RB3AN27 (N27). Because the original N27 cell line has been passaged many times, the line has become a mixture of cell types with highly variable expression of TH. In the current study, we have performed multiple rounds of clonal cultures and have identified a dopaminergic cell clone expressing high levels of TH and the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have named this new clone N27-A. Nearly 100% of N27-A cells express TH, DAT and Tuj1. Western blots have confirmed that N27-A cells have three to four times the levels of TH and DAT compared to the previous mixed population in N27. Further analysis has shown that the new clone expresses the dopamine neuron transcription factors Nurr1, En1, FoxA2 and Pitx3. The N27-A cells express the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), but do not express dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DβH), the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine. Functional analysis has shown that N27-A cells are more sensitive than N27 cells to neurotoxins taken up by the dopamine transporter such as 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+). The DAT inhibitor nomifensine can block MPP+ induced toxicity. The non-selective toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide were similar in both cell lines. The N27-A cells show dopamine release under basal and depolarization conditions. We conclude that the new N27-A clone of the immortalized rat dopaminergic cell line N27 should provide an improved in vitro model for Parkinson's disease research.((PMID:27501760))Hepatocytes from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) are expected to be a useful source for cell transplantation. However, relatively low efficiency and repeatability of hepatic differentiation of human BM-MSCs remains an obstacle for clinical translation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α), a critical transcription factor, plays an essential role in the entire process of liver development. In this study, immortalized hBM-MSCs, UE7T-13 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector containing HNF4α. The typical fibroblast-like morphology of the MSCs changed, and polygonal, epithelioid cells grew out after HNF4α transduction. In hepatocyte culture medium, HNF4α-transduced MSCs (E7-hHNF4α cells) strongly expressed the albumin (ALB), CYP2B6, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), and FOXA2 mRNA and exhibited morphology markedly similar to that of mature hepatocytes. The E7-hHNF4α cells showed hepatic functions such as Indocyanine green (ICG) uptake and release, glycogen storage, urea production and ALB secretion. Approximately 28% of E7-hHNF4α cells expressed both ALB and AAT. Furthermore, these E7-hHNF4α cells via superior mesenteric vein (SMV) injection expressed human ALB in mouse chronic injured liver. In conclusion, this study represents a novel strategy by directly inducing hepatocyte-like cells from MSCs.((PMID:27481213))This study examines a pretreatment strategy to strengthen the hepatic lineage divergence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).BMSCs were expanded in the presence or absence of nanofiber (NF) and treated with growth factors (GF) prior to transplantation. Thioacetamide (TA) was used for liver fibrosis induction and transplantation of NF-expanded BMSCs was compared biochemically and histologically to the cells expanded without NF scaffold.The ultraweb NF caused better proliferation and characterization of MSCs. MSCs transplantation significantly improved liver functions, increased hepatic HGF and Bcl-2 levels, whereas decreased serum fibronectin, hepatic TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels. Hepatic HNF4α, FOXa2, CYP7a1 genes expression were enhanced while β-5-Tub and AFP genes expression were depressed. Histological study documented these results. Differentiated NF-MSCs showed pronounced enhancement of the aforementioned parameters as compared to differentiated MSCs in the absence of NF.pretreatment with growth factors in the presence of NF augment homing, repopulation and hepatic differentiation abilities of MSCs and proves to be a promising approach for the treatment of liver fibrosis.((PMID:27467521))ELOVL family member 6, elongation of very long chain fatty acids (Elovl6) is a microsomal enzyme, which regulates the elongation of C12-16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Elovl6 has been shown to be associated with various pathophysiologies including insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. To investigate a potential role of Elovl6 during bone development, we here examined a skeletal phenotype of Elovl6 knockout (Elovl6-/-) mice. The Elovl6-/- skeleton was smaller than that of controls, but exhibited no obvious patterning defects. Histological analysis revealed a reduced length of proliferating and an elongated length of hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, and decreased trabecular bone in Elovl6-/- mice compared with controls. These results were presumably due to a modest decrease in chondrocyte proliferation and accelerated differentiation of cells of the chondrocyte lineage. Consistent with the increased length of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer in Elovl6-/- mice, Collagen10α1 was identified as one of the most affected genes by ablation of Elovl6 in chondrocytes. Furthermore, this elevated expression of Collagen10α1 of Elovl6-null chondrocytes was likely associated with increased levels of Foxa2/a3 and Mef2c mRNA expression. Relative increases in protein levels of nuclear Foxa2 and cytoplasmic histone deacethylase 4/5/7 were also observed in Elovl6 knockdown cells of the chondrocyte lineage. Collectively, our data suggest that Elovl6 plays a critical role for proper development of embryonic growth plate.((PMID:27466203))The ZIC2 transcription factor is one of the genes most commonly mutated in Holoprosencephaly (HPE) probands. Studies in cultured cell lines and mice have shown a loss of ZIC2 function is the pathogenic mechanism but the molecular details of this ZIC2 requirement remain elusive. HPE arises when signals that direct morphological and fate changes in the developing brain and facial primordia are not sent or received. One critical signal is sent from the prechordal plate (PrCP) which develops beneath the ventral forebrain. An intact NODAL signal transduction pathway and functional ZIC2 are both required for PrCP establishment. We now show that ZIC2 acts downstream of the NODAL signal during PrCP development. ZIC2 physically interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3, the receptor activated proteins that control transcription in a NODAL dependent manner. Together SMAD3 and ZIC2 regulate FOXA2 transcription in cultured cells and Zic2 also controls the foxA2 expression during Xenopus development. Variant forms of the ZIC2 protein, associated with HPE in man or mouse, are deficient in their ability to influence SMAD-dependent transcription. These findings reveal a new mechanism of NODAL signal transduction in the mammalian node and provide the first molecular explanation of how ZIC2 loss-of-function precipitates HPE.((PMID:27430660))Currently, there are emerging multiple studies on human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) in ovarian cancer. HE4 possesses higher sensitivity and specificity than CA125 in the confirmative early diagnosis for ovarian cancer. Although much attention has been given to explore its clinical application, research of the basic mechanisms of HE4 in ovarian cancer are still unclear. In the present study, we provide fundamental data to identify full-scale differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to HE4 by use of human whole-genome microarrays in human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line ES-2 following overexpression and silencing of HE4. We found that a total of 717 genes were upregulated and 898 genes were downregulated in the HE4-overexpressing cells vs. the HE4-Mock cells, and 166 genes were upregulated and 285 were downregulated in the HE4-silenced cells vs. the HE4-Mock cells. An overlap of 16 genes consistently upregulated and 8 genes downregulated in response to HE4 were noted. These DEGs were involved in MAPK, steroid biosynthesis, cell cycle, the p53 hypoxia pathway, and focal adhesion pathways. Interaction network analysis predicted that the genes participated in the regulatory connection. Highly differential expression of the FOXA2, SERPIND1, BDKRD1 and IL1A genes was verified by quantitative real-time PCR in 4 cell line samples. Finally, SERPIND1 (HCII) was validated at the protein level by immunohistochemistry in 107 paraffin-embedded ovarian tissues. We found that SERPIND1 may act as a potential oncogene in the development of ovarian cancer. The present study displayed the most fundamental and full-scale data to show DEGs in response to HE4. These identified genes may provide a theoretical basis for investigations of the underlying molecular mechanism of HE4 in ovarian cancer.((PMID:27391166))Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived endodermal cells are of interest for the development of cellular therapies to treat disorders such as liver failure. The soluble form of activin A (Act) has been widely used as an in vitro inducer of definitive endoderm (DE). In this study, we have developed a nanofibrous poly (ɛ-caprolactone) substrate, biofunctionalized with Act, for directed differentiation of hESCs into DE. Bioconjugation of Act on nanofibrous meshes was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunostaining. In order to investigate the bioactivity of immobilized Act (iAct), hESCs were cultivated on the Act-conjugated nanofibers for five days. The nanofibers with covalent iAct significantly increased expression levels of the endodermal markers SOX17, FOXA2, and CXCR4, compared with physically adsorbed Act (aAct) or without Act (noAct). In addition, iAct retained its bioactivity after storage for five days in the absence of cell seeding. The capability of cultivated cells to generate the DE-derived lineage was evaluated through further differentiation of seeded cells into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Interestingly, the iAct sample showed a higher level of hepatic markers compared to the aAct sample. We also demonstrated that iAct in the presence of soluble Act (sAct) could improve the conventional protocol to generate HLCs from hESCs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hypoxia has been demonstrated to play an important role in embryonic formation and development and to modulate stem cell differentiation. However, the influence of oxygen tension on thyroid differentiation has not been studied. In this study, we used murine induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for thyroid cell differentiation under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and compared differentiation efficiency in morphology, function, gene and protein expression under both conditions. We found that hypoxia promoted adhesion and outgrowth of embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from murine iPS cells. Expression of endodermal markers (Foxa2 and Gata4) and thyroid transcription factors (Pax8 and Nkx2.1) was increased by hypoxia at both gene and protein levels during early-mid differentiation stages (p<0.05). And so were the thyroid specific markers NIS and TSHR at the end of the experiment (p<0.05). In addition, functional iodide uptake by differentiated cells was also increased after hypoxia. Thyroid differentiation from iPS cells is enhanced under hypoxia and this may involve hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) and their downstream gene FGF2. Our data offer a foundation for understanding thyroid development and provide a potentially more efficient way to use cell therapy for treating thyroid deficiency.((PMID:27343168)): The progressive death of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is the principal cause of symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Stem cells have potential therapeutic use in replacing these cells and restoring function. To facilitate development of this approach, we sought to establish a preclinical model based on a large nonhuman primate for testing the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based transplantation. To this end, we differentiated baboon fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (biPSCs) into dopaminergic neurons with the application of specific morphogens and growth factors. We confirmed that biPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons resemble those found in the human midbrain based on cell type-specific expression of dopamine markers TH and GIRK2. Using the reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we also showed that biPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons express PAX6, FOXA2, LMX1A, NURR1, and TH genes characteristic of this cell type in vivo. We used perforated patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that biPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons fired spontaneous rhythmic action potentials and high-frequency action potentials with spike frequency adaption upon injection of depolarizing current. Finally, we showed that biPSC-derived neurons released catecholamines in response to electrical stimulation. These results demonstrate the utility of the baboon model for testing and optimizing the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PD.Functional dopamine neurons were produced from baboon induced pluripotent stem cells, and their properties were compared to baboon midbrain cells in vivo. The baboon has advantages as a clinically relevant model in which to optimize the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Baboons possess crucial neuroanatomical and immunological similarities to humans, and baboon pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into functional neurons that mimic those in the human brain, thus laying the foundation for the utility of the baboon model for evaluating stem cell therapies.((PMID:27299363))As known from model organisms, such as frog, fish, mouse, and chicken, the anterior-posterior patterning of the definitive endoderm (DE) into distinct domains is controlled by a variety of signaling interactions between the DE and its surrounding mesoderm. This includes Wnt/FGFs and BMPs in the posterior half and all-trans-retinoic acid, TGF-β-ligands, Wnt-, and BMP-inhibitors in the anterior half of the DE sheet. However, it is currently unclear how these embryonic tissue interactions can be translated into a defined differentiation protocol for human embryonic stem cells. Activin A has been proposed to direct DE into a SOX2-positive foregut-like cell type. Due to the pleiotropic nature of SOX2 in pluripotency and developing cells of the foregut, we purified DE-cells by magnetic cell sorting and tested the effects of anteriorizing and posteriorizing factors on pure endoderm. We show in contrast to previous studies that the generation of the foregut marked by SOX2/FOXA2 double-positive cells does not depend on activin A/TGF-β-signaling but is mediated by the inhibition of Wnt- and BMP-signaling. Retinoic acid can posteriorize and at the same time dorsalize the foregut toward a PDX1-positive pancreatic duodenal cell type whereas active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling synergistically with FGF-2, BMP-4, and RA induces the formation of CDX2-positive posterior endoderm. Thus, these results provide new insights into the mechanisms behind cell specification of human DE derived from pluripotent stem cells.

While orthotopic transplantation into the testis promotes seminomatous growth of the seminoma-like cell line TCam-2, ectopic xenotransplantation into the flank initiates reprogramming into an EC-like fate.During this reprogramming, BMP signaling is inhibited, leading to induction of NODAL signaling, upregulation of pluripotency factors and downregulation of seminoma markers, like SOX17. The pluripotency factor and EC-marker SOX2 is strongly induced.Here, we adressed the molecular role of SOX2 in this reprogramming. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing, we established SOX2-deficient TCam-2 cells. Xenografting of SOX2-deficient cells into the flank of nude mice resulted in maintenance of a seminoma-like fate, indicated by the histology and expression of OCT3/4, SOX17, TFAP2C, PRDM1 and PRAME. In SOX2-deficient cells, BMP signaling is inhibited, but NODAL signaling is not activated. Thus, SOX2 appears to be downstream of BMP signaling but upstream of NODAL activation. So, SOX2 is an essential factor in acquiring an EC-like cell fate from seminomas.A small population of differentiated cells was identified resembling a mixed non-seminoma. Analyses of these cells revealed downregulation of the pluripotency and seminoma markers OCT3/4, SOX17, PRDM1 and TFAP2C. In contrast, the pioneer factor FOXA2 and its target genes were upregulated, suggesting that FOXA2 might play an important role in induction of non-seminomatous differentiation.((PMID:26892307))We have previously shown that exposure to phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) causes an increase in the expression of the transcription factor otx2 in the olfactory epithelium (OE) of juvenile zebrafish, and this change is correlated with the formation of an odor memory of PEA. Here, we show that the changes in otx2 expression are specific to βPEA: exposure to αPEA did not affect otx2 expression. We identified 34 olfactory receptors (ORs) representing 16 families on 4 different chromosomes as candidates for direct regulation of OR expression via Otx2. Subsequent in silico analysis uncovered Hnf3b binding sites closely associated with Otx2 binding sites in the regions flanking the ORs. Analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq of OR expression in developing zebrafish exposed to different isoforms of PEA showed that a subset of ORs containing both Otx2/Hnf3b binding sites were downregulated only in βPEA-exposed juveniles and this change persisted through adult life. Localization of OR expression by in situ hybridization indicates the downregulation occurs at the level of RNA and not the number of cells expressing a given receptor. Finally, analysis of immediate early gene expression in the OE did not reveal changes in c-fos expression in response to either αPEA or βPEA.((PMID:26550126))Lung carcinoma is the most common and aggressive malignant tumor with poor clinical outcome. Identification of new marker of lung cancer is essential for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and find associated pathways that may function as targets of lung cancer. Gene expression profiling of GSE40791 were downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), including 100 normal specimens and 94 lung cancer samples. The DEGs were screened out by LIMMA package in R language. Besides, novel genes associated with lung cancer were identified by co-expression analysis. Then, GO enrichment and transcription binding site analysis were performed on these DEGs, and novel genes were predicted using DAVID. Finally, PPI network was constructed by String software in order to get the hub codes involved in cancer carcinoma. A total of 541 DEGs were filtered out between normal samples and patients with lung carcinoma, including 155 up-regulated genes and 386 down-regulated genes. Additionally, nine novel genes, CA4, CDC20, CHRDL1, DLGAP5, EMCN, GPM6A, NUSAP1, S1PR1 and TCF21, were figured out. The transcription biding site analysis showed that these genes were regulated by LHX3, HNF3B, CDP, HFH1, FOXO4, STAT, SOX5, MEF2, FOXO3 and SRY. Hub codes as BUB1B, MAD2L and TOP2A may play as target genes in lung carcinoma in the result of PPI network analysis. Newly predicted genes and hub codes can perform as target genes for diagnose and clinical therapy of lung cancer.((PMID:26547717))Tracheo-oesophageal malformations result from disturbed foregut separation during early development. The notochord, a specialised embryonic structure, forms immediately adjacent to the dividing foregut. In the Adriamycin mouse model of oesophageal atresia, foregut and notochord abnormalities co-exist, and the site and severity of foregut malformations closely correlate to the position and extent of the notochord defects. Notochord and foregut abnormalities also co-exist in the Noggin Knockout mouse as well in a small number of human cases. The notochord is a source of powerful molecular signals during early embryogenesis, being particularly important for neural crest development. The influence of notochord signaling on the adjacent foregut is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of notochord manipulation on foregut separation using a robust 3D explant method for culturing isolated foregut which permits oeosphageal and tracheal formation in vitro.Foregut was micro-dissected from embryonic day 9 mice (License B100/4447 Irish Medicines Board), embedded in collagen and cultured for 48 h with native notochord intact (n = 6), notochord removed (n = 10) or additional notochord transplanted from stage matched controls (n = 8). Specimens were analysed for foregut morphology and molecular patterning using immunohistochemistry for Hnf3b (an endoderm marker) and Sox2 (a notochord and oesophageal marker) on cryosections.Foregut separation into distinct oesophagus and trachea was observed in isolated foregut specimens with or without their native notochord. In specimens with additional notochord transplants, foregut morphology and molecular patterning were comparable to controls whether or not the native notochord was maintained. In particular foregut separation was not disrupted by the transplantation of additional notochord at the dorsal foregut endoderm.The relationship between the embryonic foregut and notochord is complex and ill-defined; however, the notochord does not contribute essentially to oesophagus and trachea formation beyond E9 in the mouse, and the transplantation of additional notochord does not disrupt foregut separation in 3D explant culture.((PMID:24047406))Severe shortage of liver donors and hepatocytes highlights urgent requirement of extra-liver and stem cell source of hepatocytes for treating liver-related diseases. Here we hypothesized that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can directly transdifferentiate to hepatic stem-like cells capable of differentiating into mature hepatocyte-like cells in vitro without an intervening pluripotent state.SSCs first changed into hepatic stem-like cells since they resembled hepatic oval cells in morphology and expressed Ck8, Ck18, Ck7, Ck19, OV6, and albumin. Importantly, they co-expressed CK8 and CK19 but not ES cell markers. Hepatic stem-like cells derived from SSCs could differentiate into small hepatocytes based upon their morphological features and expression of numerous hepatic cell markers but lacking of bile epithelial cell hallmarks. Small hepatocytes were further coaxed to differentiate into mature hepatocyte-like cells, as identified by their morphological traits and strong expression of Ck8, Ck18, Cyp7a1, Hnf3b, Alb, Tat, Ttr, albumin, and CYP1A2 but not Ck7 or CK19. Notably, these differentiated cells acquired functional attributes of hepatocyte-like cells because they secreted albumin, synthesized urea, and uptake and released indocyanine green. Moreover, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 rather than Akt was activated in hepatic stem cells and mature hepatocytes. Additionally, cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E transcripts and proteins but not cyclin D1 or CDK1 and CDK2 transcripts or proteins were reduced in mature hepatocyte-like cells or hepatic stem-like cells derived from SSCs compared to SSCs.SSCs can transdifferentiate to hepatic stem-like cells capable of differentiating into cells with morphological, phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature hepatocytes via the activation of ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 signaling pathways and the inactivation of cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E. This study thus provides an invaluable source of mature hepatocytes for treating liver-related diseases and drug toxicity screening and offers novel insights into mechanisms of liver development and cell reprogramming.((PMID:19917631))Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a mediator of apoptotic systems, is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in lung and breast tumors. This gene has a CpG island extending 2500 bp from the translational start site; however, studies characterizing its transcriptional regulation have not been conducted. Two transcripts for DAPK were identified that code for a single protein, while being regulated by two promoters. The previously identified DAPK transcript designated as exon 1 transcript was expressed at levels 3-fold greater than the alternate exon 1b transcript. Deletion constructs of promoter 1 identified a 332 bp region containing a functional CP2-binding site important for expression of the exon 1 transcript. While moderate reporter activity was seen in promoter 2, the region comprising intron 1 and containing a HNF3B-binding site sustained expression of the alternate transcript. Sequencing the DAPK CpG island in tumor cell lines revealed dense, but heterogenous methylation of CpGs that blocked access of the CP2 and HNF3B proteins that in turn, was associated with loss of transcription that was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Prevalences were similar for methylation of promoter 1 and 2 and intron 1 in lung tumors, but significantly greater in promoter 2 and intron 1 in breast tumors, indicative of tissue-specific differences in silencing these two transcripts. These studies show for the first time dual promoter regulation of DAPK, a tumor suppressor gene silenced in many cancers, and substantiate the importance of screening for silencing of both transcripts in tumors.((PMID:19617899))Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs have a significant role in tumor development and may constitute robust biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and functional relevance of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report that miR-122 is specifically repressed in a subset of primary tumors that are characterized by poor prognosis. We further show that the loss of miR-122 expression in tumor cells segregates with specific gene expression profiles linked to cancer progression, namely the suppression of hepatic phenotype and the acquisition of invasive properties. We identify liver-enriched transcription factors as central regulatory molecules in the gene networks associated with loss of miR-122, and provide evidence suggesting that miR-122 is under the transcriptional control of HNF1A, HNF3A and HNF3B. We further show that loss of miR-122 results in an increase of cell migration and invasion and that restoration of miR-122 reverses this phenotype. In conclusion, miR-122 is a marker of hepatocyte-specific differentiation and an important determinant in the control of cell migration and invasion. From a clinical point of view, our study emphasizes miR-122 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC progression.((PMID:19521719))One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24. The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect, affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism develop, has been suggested. We investigated a family, including one twin, with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence. Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic. We identified no mutations in ZFP57, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF3B, IPF1, PAX4, or ZIC3. The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci IGF2R, DIRAS3, and PEG1, while the other family members, including the healthy monozygotic twin, had normal findings. The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome, which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence.((PMID:19074951))Mammalian tissue- and/or time-specific transcription is primarily regulated in a combinatorial fashion through interactions between a specific set of transcriptional regulatory factors (TRFs) and their cognate cis-regulatory elements located in the regulatory regions. In exploring the DNA regions and TRFs involved in combinatorial transcriptional regulation, we noted that individual knockdown of a set of human liver-enriched TRFs such as HNF1A, HNF3A, HNF3B, HNF3G and HNF4A resulted in perturbation of the expression of several single TRF genes, such as HNF1A, HNF3G and CEBPA genes. We thus searched the potential binding sites for these five TRFs in the highly conserved genomic regions around these three TRF genes and found several putative combinatorial regulatory regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that almost all of the putative regulatory DNA regions were bound by the TRFs as well as two coactivators (CBP and p300). The strong transcription-enhancing activity of the putative combinatorial regulatory region located downstream of the CEBPA gene was confirmed. EMSA demonstrated specific bindings of these HNFs to the target DNA region. Finally, co-transfection reporter assays with various combinations of expression vectors for these HNF genes demonstrated the transcriptional activation of the CEBPA gene in a combinatorial manner by these TRFs.((PMID:14728801))Enhancer II (ENII) is one of the critical cis-elements in the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) genome for the hepatic viral gene transcription and DNA replication. The liver-specific activity of ENII is regulated by multiple liver-enriched transcription factors, including LRH-1/hB1F, HNF1, HNF3b, HNF4 and C/EBP. Knowledge on the interplay of these important factors is still limited. In this study, we demonstrate a functional synergism between the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1/hB1F and the homeoprotein HNF1 in up-regulating the liver-specific activity of ENII. This synergism is sufficient for initiating the viral gene transcription and DNA replication in non-hepatic cells. We have defined the activation domains in hB1F and HNF1 that contribute to the synergism. We further show that hB1F and HNF1 can interact directly in vitro and have mapped the domains required for this interaction.((PMID:12620499))Angiotensin II has been shown to exert complex effects on proximal tubular cell function and growth. To assess some of the direct effects on proximal tubular cells, changes in gene expression of selected cellular pathways were determined after exposure to angiotensin II. We used DNA microarrays to analyze multiple gene expression responses to increasing angiotensin II concentrations. Human proximal tubular cells were grown in flasks, and the presence of angiotensin type 1 receptor was confirmed by Western blot analysis. At passages 4-6, these cells were exposed to angiotensin II and harvested 4 h later and mRNA of the cells was extracted; 2 microg of mRNA was fluorescently conjugated for cDNA microarray hybridization. A custom-made DNA microarray was designed by selecting 300 human genes from 10 different functional systems and amplifying clones using polymerase chain reaction. Cells were subjected to 10 and 100 nM angiotensin II with paired untreated cells as controls. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, labeled and hybridized to the arrays and the ratios calculated. Ratios of > or =2.0 and < or =0.5 were considered significant. Coordinated changes were observed in genes of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 family (NHF3; HNF3A, HNF3B and HNF3G), in the E2F genes (E2F1, E2F3) and the interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF5. Induction of the expression of transcription factors points towards complex regulation of gene expression upon angiotensin II exposure. Three genes involved in the dampening of oxidative stress were enhanced. Taken together, brief exposure of human tubular epithelial cells to angiotensin II elicited a marked induction of nuclear factors, antioxidant genes and hormones and hormone receptor genes. The quick activation of transcription factors by angiotensin II indicates that angiotensin II can directly initiate a cascade of expressional events in proximal tubular cells.((PMID:12064915))We have discovered two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of the HFE gene. These mutations are -970 T-->G and -467 C-->G, numbering from the ATG start codon. When a T was present at -970, a C was always found at -467. The C allele was the less common at nt -467 with a gene frequency of 0.31 in white subjects with wild-type HFE. Slightly lower gene frequencies were observed in a small number of Hispanic and African-American subjects and a slightly higher frequency in a few Asian subjects. The less common -467 mutation was found in almost 12 chromosomes that bore the 845G-->A (C282Y) mutation and was significantly more prevalent in chromosomes containing the 187C-->G (H63D) mutation. Although this mutation is near an HNF3B/HFH2 site, its presence did not seem to affect iron metabolism as judged by the serum ferritin or transferrin saturation levels. The tighter association of the -467 polymorphism with the C282Y mutation is consistent with other data that suggest that the C282Y mutation has occurred relatively recently and that the H63D mutation is considerably older.((PMID:11311937))We cloned and characterized the mouse gene for microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A, an important protein for neuronal morphology and mitotic spindle formation. We also investigated the 5' untranslated region of the gene to characterize the promoter units. Two alternative transcripts different in the 5' region were identified by 5' RACE. Both transcripts were principally observed in the brain. Genomic cloning revealed that exons 1, 2, and 4 generate the 5' part of a long transcript, whereas exons 3 and 4 generate a short transcript. Putative 5' and intronic promoters flanking exons 1 and 3, respectively, are GC-rich and lack a canonical TATA box. DNase I footprinting from mouse cells revealed that several potential cis-elements were occupied by nuclear proteins. A reporter assay system in conjunction with a number of deletion and mutation constructs was used to test the two putative promoters. Both putative promoters showed transactivity and their function was dependent upon Sp1 sites. In addition, an NF-1 site, an HNF3B site, and an AP-1/ATF site were necessary for basal promoter activity of the intronic promoter. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms that govern the expression of the MAP1A gene.((PMID:10868949))Mutations in genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) are responsible for three of the five subtypes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). This observation and molecular studies indicate that the HNF network is required for normal function of pancreatic beta-cells. This suggests that transcription factors involved in this complex network are candidates for genetic defects in MODY. Because the HNF-3beta gene is implicated in this network, we screened it for mutations in 21 probands of French ancestry with clinical diagnosis of MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes. All of the five known MODY genes, HNF-4alpha, glucokinase, HNF-1alpha, HNF-1beta, and IPF1, were previously excluded as being the cause of diabetes in these families. By direct sequencing, we identified two transitions, an A-to-G at position -213 and a C-to-T at position -63 in the promoter and exon 1, respectively, of the HNF-3beta gene. A G-to-C transversion at position +32 in the intron 1 and three transitions, C-to-T at position 291, A-to-G at position 837, and G-to-A at position 1188 in the exon 3, resulting in noncoding mutations Ala97Ala, Gly279Gly, and Gln396Gln, respectively, were also identified. The allele frequencies were not significantly different between a control group and MODY probands. Familial segregation studies and linkage analysis showed that genetic variation in the HNF-3beta gene is unlikely to be the cause of early-onset type 2 diabetes in these Caucasian families.((PMID:10868948))Mutations in the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha and -1alpha, insulin promoter factor-1, and HNF-1beta are the causes of four forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1 and 3-5, respectively). The winged-helix transcription factor HNF-3beta has been implicated in the regulation of expression of each of these MODY genes, suggesting that mutations in the HNF-3beta gene (HNF3B) may also cause MODY. We have tested this hypothesis by screening a panel of 57 unrelated Japanese subjects with a clinical diagnosis of MODY for mutations in HNF3B. This analysis revealed four frequent polymorphisms that were not associated with MODY, including one in the promoter region (-213A/G), two silent mutations in the codons for Ala 97 (291C/T) and Gly 279 (837A/G), and one in the 3'-untranslated region (1424C/T). Two rare substitutions in the 5'-untranslated region, -156C/T and -67A/C, were found in a heterozygous state in two subjects, and two subjects were heterozygous for putative missense mutations, S109N (326G > A) and A328V (983C>T). The two missense mutations were not found in 106 normal chromosomes from nondiabetic subjects. It was not possible to test for co-segregation of these mutations with diabetes and thus, it is unclear whether or not these mutations can cause MODY. The results of our study suggest that mutations in HNF3B are not a common cause of MODY in Japanese subjects.((PMID:9730593))((PMID:9119385))((PMID:15358835))Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor and acts as a coregulator of various nuclear receptors. Herein, we examined a novel cross talk between SHP and a forkhead transcription factor HNF3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3/Foxa. Transient transfection assay demonstrated that SHP inhibited the transcriptional activity of all three isoforms of HNF3, HNF3alpha, beta, and gamma. In vivo and in vitro protein interaction studies showed that SHP physically interacted with HNF3. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP significantly decreased the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphase (G6Pase), cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in HepG2 cells and rat primary hepatocytes. Moreover, the mRNA level of G6Pase was notably increased by down-regulation of SHP with small interfering RNA. Interestingly, HNF3 transactivity was still repressed by SHPDelta128-139 that fails to repress nuclear receptors. Mapping of interaction domain revealed that SHP interacted with forkhead DNA binding domain of HNF3alpha. Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SHP inhibits DNA binding of HNF3. These results suggest that SHP is involved in the regulation of G6Pase, CYP7A1, and PEPCK gene expression via novel mechanism of inhibition of HNF3 activity and expand the role of SHP as a coregulator of other family of transcription factors in addition to nuclear receptors.((PMID:21210253))In vitro production of human hepatocytes is of primary importance in basic research, pharmacotoxicology and biotherapy of liver diseases. We have developed a protocol of differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ES) towards hepatocyte-like cells (ES-Hep). Using a set of human adult markers including CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4/7 ratio (HNF4alpha1/HNF4alpha7), cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), CYP3A4 and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and fetal markers including alpha-fetoprotein, CYP3A7 and glutathione S-transferase P1, we analyzed the expression of a panel of 41 genes in ES-Hep comparatively with human adult primary hepatocytes, adult and fetal liver. The data revealed that after 21 days of differentiation, ES-Hep are representative of fetal hepatocytes at less than 20 weeks of gestation. The glucocorticoid receptor pathway was functional in ES-Hep. Extending protocols of differentiation to 4 weeks did not improve cell maturation. When compared with hepatocyte-like cells derived from adult liver non parenchymal epithelial (NPE) cells (NPE-Hep), ES-Hep expressed several adult and fetal liver makers at much greater levels (at least one order of magnitude), consistent with greater expression of liver-enriched transcription factors Forkhead box A2, C/EBPalpha, HNF4alpha and HNF6. It therefore seems that ES-Hep reach a better level of differentiation than NPE-Hep and that these cells use different lineage pathways towards the hepatic phenotype. Finally we showed that lentivirus-mediated expression of xenoreceptor CAR in ES-Hep induced the expression of several detoxification genes including CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, UDP-glycosyltransferase 1A1, solute carriers 21A6, as well as biotransformation of midazolam, a CYP3A4-specific substrate.((PMID:24380658))On the basis of their self-renewal capacity and their ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers, germ line-derived multipotent adult stem cells (maGSCs) from mouse testis might serve as one of preferable sources for pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine. In our study, we aimed for an efficient hepatic differentiation protocol that is applicable for both maGSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We attempted to accomplish this goal by using a new established co-culture system with OP9 stroma cells for direct differentiation of maGSCs and ESCs into hepatic cells. We found that the hepatic differentiation of maGSCs was induced by the OP9 co-culture system in comparison to the gelatin culture. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of OP9 co-culture with activin A resulted in the increased expression of endodermal and early hepatic markers Gata4, Sox17, Foxa2, Hnf4, Afp, and Ttr compared to differentiated cells on gelatin or on OP9 alone. Moreover, the hepatic progenitors were capable of differentiating further into mature hepatic cells, demonstrated by the expression of liver-specific markers Aat, Alb, Tdo2, Krt18, Krt8, Krt19, Cps1, Sek, Cyp7a1, Otc, and Pah. A high percentage of maGSC-derived hepatic progenitors (51% AFP- and 61% DLK1-positive) and mature hepatic-like cells (26% ALB-positive) were achieved using this OP9 co-culture system. These generated hepatic cells successfully demonstrated in vitro functions associated with mature hepatocytes, including albumin and urea secretion, glycogen storage, and uptake of low-density lipoprotein. The established co-culture system for maGSCs into functional hepatic cells might serve as a suitable model to delineate the differentiation process for the generation of high numbers of mature hepatocytes in humans without genetic manipulations and make germ line-derived stem cells a potential autologous and alternative cell source for hepatic transplants in metabolic liver disorders.((PMID:17086172))When differentiated in the presence of activin A in serum-free conditions, mouse embryonic stem cells efficiently generate an endoderm progenitor population defined by the coexpression of either Brachyury, Foxa2 and c-Kit, or c-Kit and Cxcr4. Specification of these progenitors with bone morphogenetic protein-4 in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor and activin A results in the development of hepatic populations highly enriched (45-70%) for cells that express the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin proteins. These cells also express transcripts of Afp, Alb1, Tat, Cps1, Cyp7a1 and Cyp3a11; they secrete albumin, store glycogen, show ultrastructural characteristics of mature hepatocytes, and are able to integrate into and proliferate in injured livers in vivo and mature into hepatocytes expressing dipeptidyl peptidase IV or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. Together, these findings establish a developmental pathway in embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures that leads to efficient generation of cells with an immature hepatocytic phenotype.((PMID:21850186))Corneal epithelium is maintained by a population of stem cells (SCs) that have not been identified by specific molecular markers. The objective of this study was to find new putative markers for these SCs and to identify associated molecular pathways.Real time PCR (rt-PCR) was performed in 24 human limbal and central corneal epithelial samples to evaluate the gene expression profile of known corneal epithelial SC-associated markers. A pool of those samples was further analyzed by a rt-PCR array (RT²-PCR-A) for 84 genes related to the identification, growth, maintenance, and differentiation of SCs.Cells from the corneal epithelium SC niche showed significant expression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) and cytokeratin (KRT)15, KRT14, and KRT5 genes. RT²-PCR-A results indicated an increased or decreased expression in 21 and 24 genes, respectively, in cells from the corneal SC niche compared to cells from the central corneal epithelium. Functional analysis by proprietary software found 4 different associated pathways and a novel network with the highest upregulated genes in the corneal SC niche. This led to the identification of specific molecules, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), islet-1 transcription factor LIM/homeodomain (ISL1), collagen-type II alpha 1 (COL2A), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), aggrecan (ACAN), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), Gap junction protein beta 1/connexin 32 (GJB1/Cnx32), and Msh homeobox 1 (MSX1), that could be used to recognize putative corneal epithelial SCs grown in culture and intended for transplantation. Other molecules, NCAM1 and GJB1/Cnx32, potentially could be used to positively purify them, and Par-6 partitioning defective 6 homolog alpha (PARD6A) to negatively purify them.Knowledge of these gene and molecular pathways has provided a better understanding of the signaling molecular pathways associated with progenitor-rich limbal epithelium. This knowledge potentially could give support to the design and development of innovative therapies with the potential to reverse corneal blindness arising from ocular surface failure.((PMID:26929406))FoxO1 binds to insulin response elements located in the promoters of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), activating their expression. Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 promotes cytoplasmic translocation, inhibiting FoxO1-mediated transactivation. We have previously demonstrated that FoxO1 opens and remodels chromatin assembled from the IGFBP1 promoter via a highly conserved winged helix motif. This finding, which established FoxO1 as a "pioneer" factor, suggested a model whereby FoxO1 chromatin remodeling at regulatory targets facilitates binding and recruitment of additional regulatory factors. However, the impact of FoxO1 phosphorylation on its ability to bind chromatin and the effect of FoxO1 loss on recruitment of neighboring transcription factors at its regulatory targets in liver chromatin is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that an amino acid substitution that mimics insulin-mediated phosphorylation of a serine in the winged helix DNA binding motif curtails FoxO1 nucleosome binding. We also demonstrate that shRNA-mediated loss of FoxO1 binding to the IGFBP1 and G6Pase promoters in HepG2 cells significantly reduces binding of RNA polymerase II and the pioneer factors FoxA1/A2. Knockdown of FoxA1 similarly reduced binding of RNA polymerase II and FoxO1. Reduction in acetylation of histone H3 Lys-27 accompanies loss of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 binding. Interdependent binding of FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 possibly entails cooperative binding because FoxO1 and FoxA1/A2 facilitate one another's binding to IGFPB1 promoter DNA. These results illustrate how transcription factors can nucleate transcriptional events in chromatin in response to signaling events and suggest a model for regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism through interdependent FoxO/FoxA binding.((PMID:25299227))The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is crucial for pattern formation in early central nervous system development. By systematically analyzing high-throughput in situ hybridization data of E11.5 mouse brain, we found that Shh and its receptor Ptch1 define two adjacent mutually exclusive gene expression domains: Shh+Ptch1- and Shh-Ptch1+. These two domains are associated respectively with Foxa2 and Gata3, two transcription factors that play key roles in specifying them. Gata3 ChIP-seq experiments and RNA-seq assays on Gata3-knockdown cells revealed that Gata3 up-regulates the genes that are enriched in the Shh-Ptch1+ domain. Important Gata3 targets include Slit2 and Slit3, which are involved in the process of axon guidance, as well as Slc18a1, Th and Qdpr, which are associated with neurotransmitter synthesis and release. By contrast, Foxa2 both up-regulates the genes expressed in the Shh+Ptch1- domain and down-regulates the genes characteristic of the Shh-Ptch1+ domain. From these and other data, we were able to reconstruct a gene regulatory network governing both domains. Our work provides the first genome-wide characterization of the gene regulatory network involved in the Shh pathway that underlies pattern formation in the early mouse brain.((PMID:23534516))To investigate the therapeutic mechanism of Bleomycin A5 on infancy hemangioma.After intralesional injection of Bleomycin A5 into the tumor of animal model of infancy hemangioma, the variation of tumor form was and the variation of tumor structure were observed using light microscope and electron microscope, the variation of tumor gene expression spectra was also tested by DNA microarray technique.After treatment, the tumor gradually shrunk, hardened, disappeared one month later. The tumor lost appearance of infancy hemangioma and replaced by lamellar collagen fibers and cellular nucleus scattered in the fibers, and almost all cells were necrotic and dissolved. Under electron microscope, only large stretches of dissolved cell could be seen without intact cells and blood vessels, but apoptotic cells and bodies could also be found. The results of DNA microarray analysis showed that 9 genes associated with apoptosis (murine double minute 2, heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit, lymphotoxin B receptor, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily 7, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 21, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1A, myeloid cell leukemia-1, caspase3), 13 genes associated with cell proliferation and cell cycle (cell division cycle27, cell division cycle37, CDC28 protein kinase 1B, cycling B1, cullin 2, cullin 3, cullin 4A, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45A, meiotic recombination 11 homolog B, forkhead box M1, minichromosome maintenance 7, antigen identified by monoclonal antibody ki 67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and 11 genes associated with cellular stress and toxic reaction (glutathione peroxidase 1, metallothioneins, superoxide dismutase-1, heat shock protein A1A, heat shock protein A2, heat shock protein A4, heat shock protein A5, heat shock protein 9B, heat shock protein CA, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor)were up or down regulated more than 2 folds in tumors treated with Bleomycin A5 compared with controls.The therapeutic effect of Bleomycin A5 on infancy hemangioma is the synthetic results of multiple factors. Bleomycin A5 could not only induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation, but also depressed the ability of cell stress and toxic reaction.((PMID:21685154))Receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) are cell-surface receptors expressed by pulmonary tissue that influence alveolar type (AT) II-ATI transition required for normal alveolar formation. However, the precise contribution of RAGE in interactions between pulmonary epithelium and splanchnic mesenchyme during lung organogenesis remains uncertain. To test the hypothesis that RAGE misexpression adversely affects lung morphogenesis, conditional transgenic mice were generated that overexpress RAGE. Mice that overexpress RAGE throughout embryogenesis experienced 100% mortality and significant lung hypoplasia coincident with large, vacuous areas in the periphery when compared with normal airway and alveolar architecture observed in control mouse lungs. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry employing cell-specific markers for distal (forkhead box protein A2) and respiratory (thyroid transcription factor-1) epithelium, ATII cells (pro-surfactant protein-C), and ATI cells (T1-α) demonstrated anomalies in key epithelial cell populations resulting from RAGE up-regulation. These results reveal that precise regulation of RAGE expression is required during lung formation. Furthermore, abundant RAGE results in profound alterations in epithelial cell differentiation that culminate in severe respiratory distress and perinatal lethality.((PMID:18682709))Thyroid carcinoma cells often do not express thyroid-specific genes including sodium iodide symporter (NIS), thyroperoxidase (TPO), thyroglobulin (TG), and thyrotropin-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). Treatment of thyroid carcinoma cells (four papillary and two anaplastic cell lines) with histone deacetylase inhibitors (SAHA or VPA) modestly induced the expression of the NIS gene. The promoter regions of the thyroid-specific genes contained binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 beta (HNF3 beta)/forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP beta). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed decreased expression of HNF3 beta/FoxA2 and TTF-1 mRNA in papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines, when compared with normal thyroid cells. Forced expression of these genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells inhibited their growth. Furthermore, the CpG island in the promoter region of HNF3 beta/FoxA2 was aberrantly methylated; and treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Az) induced its expression. Immunohistochemical staining showed that C/EBP beta was localised in the nucleus in normal thyroid cells but was detected in the cytoplasm in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. Subcellular fractionation of papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines also demonstrated high levels of expression of C/EBP beta in the cytoplasm, suggesting that a large proportion of C/EBP beta protein is inappropriately localised in the cytoplasm. In summary, these findings reveal novel abnormalities in thyroid carcinoma cells.((PMID:17553805))The human gene MUC4 encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is developmentally regulated and expressed along the undifferentiated pseudostratified epithelium, as early as 6.5 weeks during fetal development. Immunohistochemical analysis of Muc4 expression in developing mouse lung and gastrointestinal tract showed a different spatio-temporal pattern of expression before and after cytodifferentiation. The molecular mechanisms governing MUC4 expression during development are, however, unknown. Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF), forkhead box A (FOXA), GATA, and caudal-related homeobox transcription factors (TFs) are known to control cell differentiation of gut endoderm derived-tissues during embryonic development. They also control the expression of cell- and tissue-specific genes and may thus control MUC4 expression. To test this hypothesis, we studied and deciphered the molecular mechanisms responsible for MUC4 transcriptional regulation by these TFs. Experiments using small interfering RNA, cell co-transfection, and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that MUC4 is regulated at the transcriptional level by CDX-1 and -2, HNF-1 alpha and -1 beta, FOXA1/A2, HNF-4 alpha and -4 gamma, and GATA-4, -5, and -6 factors in a cell-specific manner. Binding of TFs was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gel-shift assays. Altogether, these results demonstrate that MUC4 is a target gene of endodermal TFs and thus point out an important role for these TFs in regulating MUC4 expression during epithelial differentiation during development, cancer, and repair.((PMID:15138929))Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) is a winged helix nuclear transcription protein that regulates the expression of genes that are critical to lung morphogenesis, differentiation, and function, including thyroid transcription factor-1, surfactant proteins, and Clara cell secretory protein. We examined the immunoreactivity of Foxa2 in paraffin sections of 75 lung tumors: 17 typical carcinoids, 2 atypical carcinoids, 4 large cell neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas, 23 small cell carcinomas, 19 adenocarcinomas, 7 squamous cell carcinomas, and 3 (non-NE) large cell carcinomas, using a polyclonal rabbit Foxa2 antibody and a biotin-streptavidin detection system. In the adjacent lung, Foxa2 was detected in normal and hyperplastic type II cells. Foxa2 immunoreactivity was detected in 13 typical carcinoids (76%), 2 atypical carcinoids (100%), 2 large cell NE carcinomas (50%), 11 small cell carcinomas (48%), and 1 adenocarcinoma (5%). Squamous cell carcinomas and (non-NE) large cell carcinomas uniformly lacked Foxa2 staining. Expression of Foxa2 in the entire spectrum of NE lung tumors is another indication of differentiation shared by typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large cell NE carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.((PMID:26919626))Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is distinguished by aggressive growth, early dissemination and a poor prognosis at advanced stage. The remarkably high count of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of SCLC allowed for the establishment of permanent CTC cultures at our institution for the first time. CTCs are assumed to have characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, but extravasation of tumors at distal sites is marked by epithelial features. Two SCLC CTC cell lines, namely BHGc7 and BHGc10, as well as SCLC cell lines derived from primary tumors and metastases were analyzed for the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers and growth factors. Expression of E-cadherin and β-Catenin were determined by flow cytometry. Stem cell-associated markers SOX17, α-fetoprotein, OCT-3/4, KDR, Otx2, GATA-4, Nanog, HCG, TP63 and Goosecoid were not expressed in the 2 CTC lines. In contrast, high expression was found for HNF-3β/FOXA2, SOX2, PDX-1/IPF1 and E-cadherin. E-cadherin expression was restricted to the 2 CTCs and 2 cell lines derived from pleural effusion (SCLC26A) and bone metastases (NCI-H526), respectively. Thus, these SCLC CTCs established from extended disease SCLC patients lack expression of stem cell markers which suppress the epithelial phenotype. Instead they express high levels of E-cadherin consistent with a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET or EMrT) and form large tumorospheres possibly in response to the selection pressure of first-line chemotherapy. HNF-3β/FOXA2 and PDX-1/IPF1 expression seem to be related to growth factor dependence on insulin/IGF-1 receptors and IGF-binding proteins.((PMID:26774761))A major challenge in tissue engineering is to develop robust protocols for differentiating ES and iPS cells to functional adult tissues at a clinically relevant scale. The goal of this study is to develop a high throughput platform for generating bioactive, stem cell-laden microgels to direct differentiation in a well-defined microenvironment. We describe a droplet microfluidics system for fabricating microgels composed of polyethylene glycol and heparin, with tunable geometric, mechanical, and chemical properties, at kHz rates. Heparin-containing hydrogel particles sequestered growth factors Nodal and FGF-2, which are implicated in specifying pluripotent cells to definitive endoderm. Mouse ESCs were encapsulated into heparin microgels with a single dose of Nodal and FGF-2, and expressed high levels of endoderm markers Sox17 and FoxA2 after 5 days. These results highlight the use of microencapsulation for tailoring the stem cell microenvironment to promote directed differentiation, and may provide a straightforward path to large scale bioprocessing in the future.Multicellular spheroids and microtissues are valuable for tissue engineering, but fabrication approaches typically sacrifice either precision or throughput. Microfluidic encapsulation in polymeric biomaterials is a promising technique for rapidly generating cell aggregates with excellent control of microenvironmental parameters. Here we describe the microfluidic fabrication of bioactive, heparin-based microgels, and demonstrate the adsorption of heparin-binding growth factors for enhancing directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells toward endoderm. This approach also facilitated a ∼90-fold decrease in consumption of exogenous growth factors compared to conventional differentiation protocols.((PMID:26519998))Gonadotropin-releasing hormone III (GnRH3) is considered to be a key neurohormone in fish reproduction control. In the present study, the cDNA and genomic sequences of GnRH3 were cloned and characterized from large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea. The cDNA encoded a protein of 99 amino acids with four functional motifs. The full-length genome sequence was composed of 3797 nucleotides, including four exons and three introns. Higher identities of amino acid sequences and conserved exon-intron organizations were found between LcGnRH3 and other GnRH3 genes. In addition, some special features of the sequences were detected in partial species. For example, two specific residues (V and A) were found in the family Sciaenidae, and the unique 75-72 bp type of the open reading frame 2 and 3 existed in the family Cyprinidae. Analysis of the 2576 bp promoter fragment of LcGnRH3 showed a number of transcription factor binding sites, such as AP1, CREB, GATA-1, HSF, FOXA2, and FOXL1. Promoter functional analysis using an EGFP reporter fusion in zebrafish larvae presented positive signals in the brain, including the olfactory region, the terminal nerve ganglion, the telencephalon, and the hypothalamus. The expression pattern was generally consistent with the endogenous GnRH3 GFP-expressing transgenic zebrafish lines, but the details were different. These results indicate that the structure and function of LcGnRH3 are generally similar to the other teleost GnRH3 genes, but there exist some distinctions among them.((PMID:26512061))Dlx5 and Dlx6 are two closely associated homeobox genes which code for transcription factors involved in the control of steroidogenesis and reproduction. Inactivation of Dlx5/6 in the mouse results in a Leydig cell defect in the male and in ovarian insufficiency in the female. DLX5/6 are also strongly expressed by the human endometrium but their function in the uterus is unknown. The involvement of DLX5/6 in human uterine pathology is suggested by their strong downregulation in endometriotic lesions and upregulation in endometrioïd adenocarcinomas. We first show that Dlx5/6 expression begins in Müllerian ducts epithelia and persists then in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelia throughout post-natal maturation and in the adult. We then use a new mouse model in which Dlx5 and Dlx6 can be simultaneously inactivated in the endometrium using a Pgr(cre/+) allele. Post-natal inactivation of Dlx5/6 in the uterus results in sterility without any obvious ovarian involvement. The uteri of Pgr(cre/+); Dlx5/6(flox/flox) mice present very few uterine glands and numerous abnormally large and branched invaginations of the uterine lumen. In Dlx5/6 mutant uteri, the expression of genes involved in gland formation (Foxa2) and in epithelial remodelling during implantation (Msx1) is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we show that DLX5 is highly expressed in human endometrial glandular epithelium and that its expression is affected in endometriosis. We conclude that Dlx5 and Dlx6 expression determines uterine architecture and adenogenesis and is needed for implantation. Given their importance for female reproduction, DLX5 and DLX6 must be regarded as interesting targets for future clinical research.((PMID:26341558))Despite the fact that the majority of lung cancer deaths are due to metastasis, the molecular mechanisms driving metastatic progression are poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that loss of Foxa2 and Cdx2 synergizes with loss of Nkx2-1 to fully activate the metastatic program. These three lineage-specific transcription factors are consistently down-regulated in metastatic cells compared with nonmetastatic cells. Knockdown of these three factors acts synergistically and is sufficient to promote the metastatic potential of nonmetastatic cells to that of naturally arising metastatic cells in vivo. Furthermore, silencing of these three transcription factors is sufficient to account for a significant fraction of the gene expression differences between the nonmetastatic and metastatic states in lung adenocarcinoma, including up-regulated expression of the invadopodia component Tks5long, the embryonal proto-oncogene Hmga2, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal mediator Snail. Finally, analyses of tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model and patients show that low expression of Nkx2-1, Foxa2, and Cdx2 strongly correlates with more advanced tumors and worse survival. Our findings reveal that a large part of the complex transcriptional network in metastasis can be controlled by a small number of regulatory nodes that function redundantly, and loss of multiple nodes is required to fully activate the metastatic program.((PMID:25934574))In contrast to the growing interests in studying noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNA (miRNA or miR) pharmacoepigenetics, there is a lack of efficient means to cost effectively produce large quantities of natural miRNA agents. Our recent efforts led to a successful production of chimeric pre-miR-27b in bacteria using a transfer RNA (tRNA)-based recombinant RNA technology, but at very low expression levels. Herein, we present a high-yield expression of chimeric pre-miR-1291 in common Escherichia coli strains using the same tRNA scaffold. The tRNA fusion pre-miR-1291 (tRNA/mir-1291) was then purified to high homogeneity using affinity chromatography, whose primary sequence and post-transcriptional modifications were directly characterized by mass spectrometric analyses. Chimeric tRNA/mir-1291 was readily processed to mature miR-1291 in human carcinoma MCF-7 and PANC-1 cells. Consequently, recombinant tRNA/mir-1291 reduced the protein levels of miR-1291 target genes, including ABCC1, FOXA2, and MeCP2, as compared with cells transfected with the same doses of control methionyl-tRNA scaffold with a sephadex aptamer (tRNA/MSA). In addition, tRNA-carried pre-miR-1291 suppressed the growth of MCF-7 and PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly enhanced the sensitivity of ABCC1-overexpressing PANC-1 cells to doxorubicin. These results indicate that recombinant miR-1291 agent is effective in the modulation of target gene expression and chemosensitivity, which may provide insights into high-yield bioengineering of new ncRNA agents for pharmacoepigenetics research.((PMID:25843708))Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes, including cell lineage specification. Here, we report transcriptome profiling of human endoderm and pancreatic cell lineages using purified cell populations. Analysis of the data sets allows us to identify hundreds of lncRNAs that exhibit differentiation-stage-specific expression patterns. As a first step in characterizing these lncRNAs, we focus on an endoderm-specific lncRNA, definitive endoderm-associated lncRNA1 (DEANR1), and demonstrate that it plays an important role in human endoderm differentiation. DEANR1 contributes to endoderm differentiation by positively regulating expression of the endoderm factor FOXA2. Importantly, overexpression of FOXA2 is able to rescue endoderm differentiation defects caused by DEANR1 depletion. Mechanistically, DEANR1 facilitates FOXA2 activation by facilitating SMAD2/3 recruitment to the FOXA2 promoter. Thus, our study not only reveals a large set of differentiation-stage-specific lncRNAs but also characterizes a functional lncRNA that is important for endoderm differentiation.((PMID:25503986))Pancreatic β-cell failure is central to the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. We recently demonstrated that β-cells become hypoxic under high glucose conditions due to increased oxygen consumption and that the pancreatic islets of diabetic mice but not those of control mice are moderately hypoxic. However, the impact of moderate hypoxia on β-cell number and function is unknown. In the present study, moderate hypoxia induced a hypoxic response in MIN6 cells, as evidenced by increased levels of HIF-1α protein and target genes. Under these conditions, a selective downregulation of Mafa, Pdx1, Slc2a2, Ndufa5, Kcnj11, Ins1, Wfs1, Foxa2, and Neurod1, which play important roles in β-cells, was also observed in both MIN6 cells and isolated pancreatic islets. Consistent with the altered expression of these genes, abnormal insulin secretion was detected in hypoxic MIN6 cells. Most of the hypoxia-induced gene downregulation in MIN6 cells was not affected by the suppression of HIF-1α, suggesting a HIF-1-independent mechanism. Moderate hypoxia also induced apoptosis in MIN6 cells. These results suggest that hypoxia is a novel stressor of β-cells and that hypoxic stress may play a role in the deterioration of β-cell function.((PMID:25190258))The applications of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cells in regenerative medicine has encountered a long-standing challenge: how can we efficiently obtain mature cell types from hPSCs? Attempts to address this problem are hindered by the complexity of controlling cell fate commitment and the lack of sufficient developmental knowledge for guiding hPSC differentiation. Here, we developed a systematic strategy to study hPSC differentiation by labeling sequential developmental genes to encompass the major developmental stages, using the directed differentiation of pancreatic β cells from hPSCs as a model. We therefore generated a large panel of pancreas-specific mono- and dual-reporter cell lines. With this unique platform, we visualized the kinetics of the entire differentiation process in real time for the first time by monitoring the expression dynamics of the reporter genes, identified desired cell populations at each differentiation stage and demonstrated the ability to isolate these cell populations for further characterization. We further revealed the expression profiles of isolated NGN3-eGFP(+) cells by RNA sequencing and identified sushi domain-containing 2 (SUSD2) as a novel surface protein that enriches for pancreatic endocrine progenitors and early endocrine cells both in human embryonic stem cells (hESC)-derived pancreatic cells and in the developing human pancreas. Moreover, we captured a series of cell fate transition events in real time, identified multiple cell subpopulations and unveiled their distinct gene expression profiles, among heterogeneous progenitors for the first time using our dual reporter hESC lines. The exploration of this platform and our new findings will pave the way to obtain mature β cells in vitro.((PMID:23775071))The transcription factor MafA is a key regulator of insulin gene expression and maturation of islet β cells. Despite its importance, the regulatory mechanism of MafA gene expression is still unclear. To identify the transcriptional regulators of MafA, we examined various transcription factors, which are potentially involved in β cell differentiation. An adenovirus-mediated overexpression study clearly demonstrated that Onecut1 suppresses the promoter activity of MafA through the Foxa2-binding cis-element on the MafA enhancer region (named area A). However, ChIP analysis showed that Foxa2 but not Onecut1 could directly bind to area A. Furthermore, overexpression of Onecut1 inhibited the binding of Foxa2 onto area A upon ChIP analysis. Importantly, insertion of a mutation in the Foxa2-binding site of area A significantly decreased the promoter activity of MafA. These findings suggest that Onecut1 suppresses MafA gene expression through the Foxa2-binding site. In the mouse pancreas, MafA expression was first detected at the latest stage of β cell differentiation and was scarcely observed in Onecut1-positive cells during pancreas development. In addition, Onecut1 expression was significantly increased in the islets of diabetic db/db mice, whereas MafA expression was markedly decreased. The improved glucose levels of db/db mice with insulin injections significantly reduced Onecut1 expression and rescued the reduction of MafA expression. These in vivo experiments also suggest that Onecut1 is a negative regulator of MafA gene expression. This study implicates the novel role of Onecut1 in the control of normal β cell differentiation and its involvement in β cell dysfunction under diabetic conditions by suppressing MafA gene expression.((PMID:23672958))Epigenetic regulation offers a flexible means to instruct cell functions and fate. In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), thousands of genes are targets for histone modifications leading to activation or suppression of transcription. Novel research now indicates that, in hESCs, the transcription start site of FOXA2, encoding a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, is bivalently marked with histone modifications for both gene activation and repression. Moreover, FOXA2 is remarkably upregulated at an early stage of endothelial differentiation. These discoveries provide better understanding of the natural program of differentiation and also open up new opportunities for large scale production of endothelial progenitors.((PMID:23269676))MafA and Pdx1 represent critical transcriptional regulators required for the maintenance of pancreatic islet β-cell function. The in vivo β-cell-enriched expression pattern of these genes is principally directed by islet transcription factors binding within conserved Region 3 (base pairs (bp) -8118/-7750) of MafA and Area II (bp -2153/-1923) of the Pdx1 gene. Comprehensive mutational analysis of conserved MafA Region 3 revealed two new β-cell line-specific cis-activation elements, termed Site 4 (bp -7997 to -7988) and Site 12 (bp -7835 to -7826). Gel mobility and antibody super-shift analysis identified Pdx1 as the Site 4 binding factor, while an 80-88 kilodalton (kDa) β-cell line-enriched protein complex bound Site 12 and similar aligned nucleotides within Pdx1 Area II. The 80-88 kDa activator was also found in adult mouse islet extract. Strikingly, the molecular weight, DNA binding, and antibody recognition properties of this activator were unique when compared with all other key islet transcription factors tested, including Prox1 (83 kDa), Hnf1α (67 kDa), FoxA2 (48 kDa), MafA (46 kDa), Isl1 (44 kDa), Pdx1 (42 kDa), and Nkx2.2 (30 kDa). Collectively, these data define an apparently novel MafA Region 3 and Pdx1 Area II activator contributing to expression in β-cells.((PMID:23060003))Neuroendocrine (NE) prostate tumors and neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostatic adenocarcinomas have been associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we used the TRAMP mouse model that develops NE prostate tumors to identify key factors that can lead to NED. We have previously reported that NE tumors express the forkhead transcription factor, Foxa2, Mash1 (mouse achaete scute homolog-1), as well as Synaptophysin. In TRAMP, the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) first expresses Foxa2 and Synaptophysin, which then progresses to NE cancer. In order to determine if Foxa2 is dispensable for development or maintenance of NE cancer, a conditional knock-out of Foxa2 in TRAMP mice was generated by breeding mice with two floxed alleles of Foxa2 and one copy of Nkx3.1-Cre. Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice showed loss of Foxa2 expression in embryonic prostatic buds. No expression of Foxa2 was seen in the adult prostate in either conditional null or control mice. Foxa2 is universally expressed in all wild type TRAMP NE tumors, but Mash1 expression is seen only in a few samples in a few cells. With the loss of Foxa2 in the NE tumors of the TRAMP/Nkx3.1-Cre/Foxa2(loxP/loxP) mice, the expression of the pro-neuronal gene Mash1 is upregulated. NE tumors from both the TRAMP control and Foxa2-deficient TRAMP prostate express Synaptophysin and SV40 Large T-antigen, and both show a loss of androgen receptor expression in NE cells. These studies suggest that the TRAMP NE tumors can form in the absence of Foxa2 by an up regulation of Mash1.((PMID:22737085))Gene duplication is a powerful driver of evolution. Newly duplicated genes acquire new roles that are relevant to fitness, or they will be lost over time. A potential path to functional relevance is mutation of the coding sequence leading to the acquisition of novel biochemical properties, as analyzed here for the highly homologous paralogs Foxa1 and Foxa2 transcriptional regulators. We determine by genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-Seq) that, although Foxa1 and Foxa2 share a large fraction of binding sites in the liver, each protein also occupies distinct regulatory elements in vivo. Foxa1-only sites are enriched for p53 binding sites and are frequently found near genes important to cell cycle regulation, while Foxa2-restricted sites show only a limited match to the forkhead consensus and are found in genes involved in steroid and lipid metabolism. Thus, Foxa1 and Foxa2, while redundant during development, have evolved divergent roles in the adult liver, ensuring the maintenance of both genes during evolution.((PMID:22495882))LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (Lmx1a) is required for the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, roof plate formation, and cortical hem development. We generated a reporter embryonic stem cell (ESC) line for Lmx1a and used it to track differentiation and extract neural progenitors from differentiating mouse ESCs. Lmx1a(+) cells gave rise to functional cortical upper layer GABAergic neurons or dopaminergic neurons depending on the culture conditions used for differentiation. Under chemically defined neurobasal conditions, ESC differentiation resulted in widespread and transient expression of Lmx1a, without the addition of exogenous factors such as sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnts, and/or bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Under neutral conditions, Lmx1a(+) cells express genes known to be downstream of Lmx1a and cortical hem markers Wnt3a and p73. The majority of these cells did not express the ventral midbrain dopaminergic marker Foxa2 or dorsal roof plate marker BMP-2. Lmx1a(+) -Foxa2(-) cells were primed to become SatB2(+) GABAergic neurons and appeared to be resistant to dopaminergic patterning cues. PA6 coculture produced a substantial population of Lmx1a(+) progenitors that also expressed Foxa2 and on further differentiation gave rise to dopaminergic neurons at high frequency. We conclude that Lmx1a is a useful marker for the extraction of progenitors of GABAergic or dopaminergic neurons. We caution against the assumption that it indicates dopaminergic commitment during in vitro differentiation of ESCs. Indeed, in monolayer culture under neurobasal conditions, with or without the addition of Shh and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), Lmx1a(+) cells were predominantly progenitors of forebrain GABAergic neurons. We obtained dopaminergic cells in large numbers only by coculture with PA6 cells.((PMID:22485144))Global gene expression profiling was performed using RNA from human embryonic neural stem cells (hENSC), and adult human olfactory bulb-derived neural stem cells (OBNSCs), to define a gene expression pattern and signaling pathways that are specific for each cell lineage. We have demonstrated large differences in the gene expression profile of human embryonic NSC, and adult human OBNSCs, but less variability between parallel cultures. Transcripts of genes involved in neural tube development and patterning (ALDH1A2, FOXA2), progenitor marker genes (LMX1a, ALDH1A1, SOX10), proliferation of neural progenitors (WNT1 and WNT3a), neuroplastin (NPTN), POU3F1 (OCT6), neuroligin (NLGN4X), MEIS2, and NPAS1 were up-regulated in both cell populations. By Gene Ontology, 325 out of 3875 investigated gene sets were scientifically different. 41 out of the 307 investigated Cellular Component (CC) categories, 45 out of the 620 investigated Molecular Function (MF) categories, and 239 out of the 2948 investigated Biological Process (BP) categories were significant. KEGG Pathway Class Comparison had revealed that 75 out of 171 investigated gene sets passed the 0.005 significance threshold. Levels of gene expression were explored in three signaling pathways, Notch, Wnt, and mTOR that are known to be involved in NS cell fates determination. The transcriptional signature also deciphers the role of genes involved in epigenetic modifications. SWI/SNF DNA chromatin remodeling complex family, including SMARCC1 and SMARCE1, were found specifically up-regulated in our OBNSC but not in hENSC. Differences in gene expression profile of transcripts controlling epigenetic modifications, and signaling pathways might indicate differences in the therapeutic potential of our examined two cell populations in relation to in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation following engraftments in different CNS insults.((PMID:24843545))Aims/Introduction:  We recently established a strategy for isolating multipotential duct-like cells, called pdx-1-positive pancreatic cell-derived (PPPD) cells, from the pancreas. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cell differentiation, we introduced a polyoma-based episomal vector system into PPPD cells.  PPPD cells were stably transfected with a polyoma large T (PLT)-expressing plasmid vector, which included the polyoma origin of replication, to generate PLT-PPPD cells. Various cDNA for pancreas-related transcription factors were subcloned into the expression plasmid pPyCAG, which included the polyoma origin of replication. PLT-PPPD cells were stably transfected with the resulting plasmid vectors and then subjected to gene and protein expression analyses.  The coexpression of Mafa, Neurod1 and Ipf1 induced Ins1 and Ins2 expression in PLT-PPPD cells. The forced expression of Pax6 alone induced the expression of glucagon. The coexpression of Neurod1 and Isl1 induced Ins2 and Sst expression. In contrast, the expression of Ptf1a and Foxa2 induced the expression of exocrine markers Cpa1 and Amy2. Transfections with multiple transcription factors showed that Isl1 is required for the differentiation of both insulin-positive cells and somatostatin-positive cells. In addition, Foxa2 induced the differentiation of glucagon-positive cells and inhibited the differentiation of insulin-positive and somatostatin-positive cells. PLT-PPPD cells allow episomal vector-based gene expression and should be useful for studying the transcription factor cascades involved in the differentiation of pancreatic cell types in vitro.  Our coexpression study showed novel critical roles for Isl1 and Foxa2 in the differentiation of PPPD cells into endocrine cells.

Recently, we identified a locus on chromosome 20 determining high PC levels in a large Dutch pedigree with unexplained thrombophilia. Candidate genes in the LOD-1 support interval included FOXA2, THBD and PROCR.To examine these candidate genes and their influence on plasma levels of PC.Exons, promoter and 3'UTR of the candidate genes were sequenced in 12 family members with normal to high PC levels. Four haplotypes of PROCR, two SNPs in the neighboring gene EDEM2 and critical SNPs encountered during resequencing were genotyped in the family and in a large group of healthy individuals (the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS) controls). Soluble endothelial protein C receptor (sEPCR) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) plasma levels were measured in the family.PROCR haplotype 3 (H3) and FOXA2 rs1055080 were associated with PC levels in the family but only PROCR H3 was also associated with plasma levels in the healthy individuals. Carriers of both variants had higher PC levels than carriers of only PROCR H3 in the family but not in healthy individuals, suggesting that a second determinant is present. EDEM2 SNPs were associated with PC levels, but their effect was small. PC and sEPCR levels were associated in both studies. sTM was not associated with variations of THBD or PC levels.Chromosome 20 harbors genetic determinants of PC and sEPCR levels and the analysis of candidate genes suggests that the PROCR locus is responsible.((PMID:16010442))Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are implicated in cell-fate determination of embryonic stem (ES) cells and cancer cells. GREM1 (CKTSF1B1 or DAND2) and CER1 (Cerberus 1 or DAND4) are cysteine knot superfamily proteins, functioning as secreted-type BMP antagonists. BMP4 is preferentially expressed in diffuse-type gastric cancer cells. Here, vertebrate BMP4 orthologs were identified and characterized by using bioinformatics for comparative proteomics and comparative genomics analyses. Baboon BMP4 gene within AC153751.2 genome sequence encoded a 408-aa protein, showing A152V and S298P amino-acid substitutions compared with human BMP4. Cow Bmp4, bat Bmp4 and zebrafish bmp4 genes were located within AC149774.2, AC156788.2 and CR391996.2 genome sequences, respectively. Human BMP4 showed 99.5%, 98.0%, 97.8%, 97.1%, 96.3%, 83.3% and 71.1% total-amino-acid identity with baboon BMP4, cow Bmp4, bat Bmp4, mouse Bmp4, rat Bmp4, chicken bmp4 and zebrafish bmp4, respectively. Human BMP4 gene was found consisting of six exons, including novel exon 1C, and known exons 1 (1A or I), 1B (II), 2 (III), 3 (IV) and 4 (V). Forty human BMP4 ESTs started from exon 1, seven from intron 1 (5'-flanking region of exon 2), and two from exon 1C. Fourteen mouse Bmp4 ESTs started from exon 1, and one from intron 1. The 5'-flanking region of exon 1 and exon 1 itself, but not exons 1C and 1B, were well conserved between human BMP4 and rodent Bmp4 genes. The major promoter region of human BMP4 and rodent Bmp4 genes were located within the 5'-flanking region of exon 1. FOXA2, OLF1, and MYC-binding sites were conserved among the major promoter region of human, baboon, cow, bat, mouse and rat BMP4 orthologs.((PMID:25653040))Capicua (CIC) has been implicated in pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and cancer in mammals; however, the in vivo physiological functions of CIC remain largely unknown. Here we show that Cic hypomorphic (Cic-L(-/-)) mice have impaired bile acid (BA) homeostasis associated with induction of proinflammatory cytokines. We discovered that several drug metabolism and BA transporter genes were down-regulated in Cic-L(-/-) liver, and that BA was increased in the liver and serum whereas bile was decreased within the gallbladder of Cic-L(-/-) mice. We also found that levels of proinflammatory cytokine genes were up-regulated in Cic-L(-/-) liver. Consistent with this finding, levels of hepatic transcriptional regulators, such as hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), were markedly decreased in Cic-L(-/-) mice. Moreover, induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfα) expression and decrease in the levels of FOXA2, C/EBPβ, and RXRα were found in Cic-L(-/-) liver before BA was accumulated, suggesting that inflammation might be the cause for the cholestasis in Cic-L(-/-) mice. Our findings indicate that CIC is a critical regulator of BA homeostasis, and that its dysfunction might be associated with chronic liver disease and metabolic disorders.((PMID:24807696))ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause Tangier disease which is characterized by near or complete absence of circulating plasma HDL. In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXRα/RXRα. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene.((PMID:24327960))Cytokine signaling has been connected to regulation of metabolism and energy balance. Numerous cytokine gene expression changes are stimulated by accumulation of bile acids in livers of young Foxa2 liver-conditional null mice. We hypothesized that bile acid-induced inflammation in young Foxa2 mutants, once chronic, affects metabolic homeostasis. We found that loss of Foxa2 in the liver results in a premature aging phenotype, including significant weight gain, reduced food intake, and decreased energy expenditure. We show that Foxa2 antagonizes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in increased hepatic lipogenesis and adiposity. While much prior work has focused on adipose tissue in obesity, we discovered a novel age-onset obesity phenotype in a model where gene deletion occurs only in the liver, underscoring the importance of the role hepatic lipogenesis plays in the development of obesity.((PMID:19417011))Bile acids are powerful detergents produced by the liver to aid in the absorption of dietary lipids. We recently reported a novel role for Foxa2 in bile acid metabolism. The winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required to prevent intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in mice fed a cholic acid-enriched diet. Here, we use functional genomics to study how Foxa2 regulates its targets in a cholic acid-dependent manner. We found that multiple signaling pathways essential for the hepatic response to acute liver injury are impaired in livers of Foxa2-deficient mice, suggesting that the deletion of Foxa2 in the hepatocyte affects the liver on a large scale. We also discovered distinct feed-forward regulatory loops controlling Foxa2-dependent targets in a cholic acid-dependent or -independent manner. We show that Foxa2 interacts with different transcription factors to achieve gene expression responses appropriate for each physiologic state.((PMID:18840356))Homeostatic regulation of bile acid metabolism and biliary lipid secretion is critical to prevent enterohepatic diseases. Kaestner and coworkers (Bochkis et al., 2008) show that loss of forkhead box transcription factor Foxa2 in the liver leads to hepatic injury due to downregulation in the expression levels of bile acid transporters and detoxification enzymes.((PMID:18660816))Production of bile by the liver is crucial for the absorption of lipophilic nutrients. Dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis can lead to cholestatic liver disease and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show by global location analysis ('ChIP-on-chip') and cell type-specific gene ablation that the winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required for normal bile acid homeostasis. As suggested by the location analysis, deletion of Foxa2 in hepatocytes in mice using the Cre-lox system leads to decreased transcription of genes encoding bile acid transporters on both the basolateral and canalicular membranes, resulting in intrahepatic cholestasis. Foxa2-deficient mice are strikingly sensitive to a diet containing cholic acid, which results in toxic accumulation of hepatic bile salts, ER stress and liver injury. In addition, we show that expression of FOXA2 is markedly decreased in liver samples from individuals with different cholestatic syndromes, suggesting that reduced FOXA2 abundance could exacerbate the injury.((PMID:12878321))Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) is a bifunctional protein that plays a central role in carcinogen metabolism and is also able to mediate the sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids into hepatocytes. Studies have identified a subject (S-1) with extremely elevated serum bile salt levels in the absence of observable hepatocellular injury, suggesting a defect in bile acid uptake. In this individual, mEH protein and mEH mRNA levels were reduced by approximately 95% and 85%, respectively, whereas the expression and amino acid sequence of another bile acid transport protein (NTCP) was unaffected. Sequence analysis of the mEH gene (EPHX1) revealed a point mutation at an upstream HNF-3 site (allele I) and in intron 1 (allele II), which resulted in a significant decrease in EPHX1 promoter activity in transient transfection assays. Gel shift assays using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide from each region resulted in specific transcription factor binding patterns, which were altered in the presence of the mutation. These studies demonstrate that the expression of mEH is greatly reduced in a patient with hypercholanemia, suggesting that mEH participates in sodium-dependent bile acid uptake in human liver where its absence may contribute to the etiology of this disease.((PMID:11786957))We previously generated a transgenic mouse line (T-77) in which increased hepatic expression of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta) protein was used to assess its role in hepatocyte-specific gene transcription. The T-77 transgenic mice displayed elevated serum bile acid and bilirubin levels and a complete absence of hepatic glycogen storage. These postnatal liver defects were associated with diminished expression of hepatocyte genes involved in gluconeogenesis and bile acid transport as well as reduced levels of hepatocyte transcription factors. In this study, we show that mouse tail vein injections of adenovirus expressing the rat HNF-3beta (AdHNF3beta) cDNA efficiently increased its levels throughout the liver lobule and recapitulated the T-77 transgenic liver phenotype within several days postinfection. Likewise, the AdHNF3beta-infected liver phenotype was associated with reduced hepatic expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis, bile acid transport, and bilirubin conjugation, which were not found with control adenovirus infections. These studies show that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is an effective method for rapid hepatic increases in transcription factor levels to determine in vivo target genes. In contrast, AdHNF3alpha-infected liver displayed only a transient reduction in hepatic glycogen levels and was associated with less severe decreases in hepatic expression of gluconeogenic and bilirubin metabolism genes. Consistent with these findings, only T-77 transgenic and AdHNF3beta-infected liver exhibited diminished hepatic expression of the HNF-6 transcription factor, suggesting that reduced HNF-6 levels contribute to diminished HNF-3beta-specific transcriptional activity.((PMID:11027295))The winged helix transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta (HNF-3beta), mediates the hepatocyte-specific transcription of numerous genes important for liver function. However, the in vivo role of HNF-3beta in regulating these genes remains unknown because homozygous null HNF3beta mouse embryos die in utero prior to liver formation. In order to examine the regulatory function of HNF-3beta, we created transgenic mice in which the -3-kb transthyretin promoter functions to increase hepatocyte expression of the rat HNF-3beta protein. Postnatal transgenic mice exhibit growth retardation, depletion of hepatocyte glycogen storage, and elevated levels of bile acids in serum. The retarded growth phenotype is likely due to a 20-fold increase in hepatic expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), which results in elevated levels in serum of IGFBP-1 and limits the biological availability of IGFs required for postnatal growth. The defects in glycogen storage and serum bile acids coincide with diminished postnatal expression of hepatocyte genes involved in gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glycogen synthase) and sinusoidal bile acid uptake (Ntcp), respectively. These changes in gene transcription may result from the disruptive effect of HNF-3beta on the hepatic expression of the endogenous mouse HNF-3alpha,-3beta, -3gamma, and -6 transcription factors. Furthermore, adult transgenic livers lack expression of the canalicular phospholipid transporter, mdr2, which is consistent with ultrastructure evidence of damage to transgenic hepatocytes and bile canaliculi. These transgenic studies represent the first in vivo demonstration that the HNF-3beta transcriptional network regulates expression of hepatocyte-specific genes required for bile acid and glucose homeostasis, as well as postnatal growth.((PMID:22877565))We aimed to investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) influences apolipoprotein M (ApoM) expression and pre-β-high-density lipoprotin (HDL) formation, and whether forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and Nur77 are involved in this process.We analyzed the serum VEGF concentrations of 264 adults who underwent a medical checkup and found that VEGF concentration was positively correlated with serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and ApoB concentrations, but was negatively correlated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoM concentrations. We further investigated the effects of VEGF on ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation, and the mechanisms responsible, in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. VEGF markedly downregulated ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation. At the same time, expression of Foxa2 was also inhibited, whereas expression of Nur77 was increased by treatment with VEGF. Furthermore, small interfering (si) RNA knockdown of Foxa2 made the downregulation of VEGF on ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation even more obvious. In addition, siRNA knockdown of Nur77 significantly compensated for the inhibitory effect of VEGF on Foxa2 expression, whereas the Nur77 agonist cytosporone B led to the downregulation of Foxa2 expression more significantly than VEGF. Moreover, overexpression of a Nur77 transgene in C57BL/6 mice resulted in decreased serum ApoM and pre-β-HDL levels, whereas si-Nur77-treated mice displayed upregulated serum ApoM and pre-β-HDL levels.These results provide evidence that VEGF may first downregulate expression of Foxa2 by enhancing Nur77 activity and then decrease expression of ApoM and pre-β-HDL formation. Therefore, our study may be useful in understanding the critical effect of VEGF in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.((PMID:20846698))Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most frequent causes of abnormal liver dysfunction associated with synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. Adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1/R2) and insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1/-2) are known as modulators of these fatty acid metabolisms in the liver; however, the regulatory roles of these receptors in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids are unclear in the liver of NASH. In this study, we examined the roles of hepatic AdipoR1/R2 and IRS-1/-2 in NASH using an animal model. After feeding a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet to obese fa/fa Zucker rats for 8 weeks, rats showed fatty liver spontaneously with inflammation and fibrosis that are characteristic of NASH. The expression levels of AdipoR1/R2 and IRS-2 were significantly decreased, whereas IRS-1 was significantly increased, in NASH. As a result of the decrease of AdipoR1/R2 expression, the messenger RNA expression levels of genes located downstream of AdipoR1/R2, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1/α2, which inhibits fatty acid synthesis, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, which activates fatty acid oxidation, also decreased. Expression level of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c was found to be elevated, suggesting the up-regulation of IRS-1, and resulted in increased fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, increase of forkhead box protein A2 expression was observed, which might be associated with the down-regulation of IRS-2, facilitating fatty acid oxidation. Taken together, increased synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids by up- or down-regulation of AdipoR or IRS may contribute to the progression of NASH. Thus, AdipoR and IRS might be crucially important regulators for the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids in the liver of NASH.((PMID:27247576))The lipophilic statin lovastatin decreases cholesterol synthesis and is a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence points at antitumor potential of lovastatin. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of lovastatin function in different cell types is critical to effective therapy design. In this study, we investigated the effects of lovastatin on the differentiation potential of human embryonic stem (hES) cells (H9 cell line). Multiparameter flow cytometric assay was used to detect changes in the expression of transcription factors characteristic of hES cells. We found that lovastatin treatment delayed NANOG downregulation during ectodermal and endodermal differentiation. Likewise, expression of ectodermal (SOX1 and OTX2) and endodermal (GATA4 and FOXA2) markers was higher in treated cells. Exposure of hES cells to lovastatin led to a minor decrease in the expression of SSEA-3 and a significant reduction in CD133 expression. Treated cells also formed fewer embryoid bodies than control cells. By analyzing hES with and without CD133, we discovered that CD133 expression is required for proper formation of embryoid bodies. In conclusion, lovastatin reduced the heterogeneity of hES cells and impaired their differentiation potential.((PMID:24997396))Characterization of the epigenome promises to yield the functional elements buried in the human genome sequence, thus helping to annotate non-coding DNA polymorphisms with regulatory functions. Here, we develop two novel strategies to combine epigenomic data with transcriptomic profiles in humans or mice to prioritize potential candidate SNPs associated with lipid levels by genome-wide association study (GWAS). First, after confirming that lipid-associated loci that are also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in human livers are enriched for ENCODE regulatory marks in the human hepatocellular HepG2 cell line, we prioritize candidate SNPs based on the number of these marks that overlap the variant position. This method recognized the known SORT1 rs12740374 regulatory SNP associated with LDL-cholesterol, and highlighted candidate functional SNPs at 15 additional lipid loci. In the second strategy, we combine ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and liver expression datasets from knockout mice lacking specific transcription factors. This approach identified SNPs in specific transcription factor binding sites that are located near target genes of these transcription factors. We show that FOXA2 transcription factor binding sites are enriched at lipid-associated loci and experimentally validate that alleles of one such proxy SNP located near the FOXA2 target gene BIRC5 show allelic differences in FOXA2-DNA binding and enhancer activity. These methods can be used to generate testable hypotheses for many non-coding SNPs associated with complex diseases or traits.((PMID:16459311))Forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 activates genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and is regulated by insulin. Activation of Foxa2 in the liver leads to increased oxidation and secretion of fatty acids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs), a process impaired in type 2 diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that Foxa2 is coactivated by PPARgamma coactivator beta (Pgc-1beta). Adenoviral expression of Foxa2 and Pgc-1beta in livers of ob/ob mice results in decreased hepatic TAG content and increased plasma TAG concentrations. In addition, the concerted action of Foxa2/Pgc-1beta activates genes in mitochondrial beta oxidation and enhances fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, Foxa2/Pgc-1beta induce the expression of microsomal transfer protein, thereby increasing apoB-containing VLDL secretion. This process is inhibited by insulin through a Foxa2-dependent mechanism. These data demonstrate that Foxa2/Pgc-1beta regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis by affecting the clearance rate of fatty acids through oxidation and/or secretion of lipids in response to insulin.((PMID:20059580))The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates diverse dioxin toxicities. While the acute effects of activation of the AhR pathway by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) have been a focus of past study, the role of this pathway in normal physiology and ageing is unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the portion of the reproductive axis [ovary vs. hypothalamus and pituitary gland (H-H axis)] and the stages of the reproductive lifespan (foetal and early post-natal life vs. adolescence and adulthood) that are particularly sensitive to the effects of TCDD during female reproductive ageing. Adult pregnant Lewis rat dams were dosed with corn oil vehicle or TCDD (50 ng/kg-week by gavage) on days 14 and 21 of gestation and post-natal days 7 and 14 to provide in utero and lactational (IUL) exposure to pups. Female pups (n = 96) were weaned on post-natal day 21 and dosed with TCDD or vehicle weekly. Half of the pups were used as donors for ovary transplantation while the remainder were recipients. Following ovary transplantation, rats (n = 6-8 per group) received weekly TCDD or vehicle again until sacrifice at 8 months of age. Beginning at vaginal opening, reproductive cycles were monitored by vaginal cytology for 10 days each month. Blood samples were collected at 22.00 h on proestrus to measure concentration of 17beta-oestradiol in serum. Real-time PCR was used to determine differences in Cyp1a1, Cyp19a1, Cyp17a1, LH receptor (LHR), FoxA2 and FoxJ1 genes expression between control and remaining groups. IUL exposure of the H-H axis plus adult exposure of the whole body to TCDD significantly delayed puberty in females rats. Data analysis revealed an accelerated onset of acyclicity by 5 months in all groups involving IUL exposure of the developing ovary to TCDD. 17beta-oestradiol was significantly decreased in animals receiving TCDD during IUL exposure of the H-H axis. CYP1a1 expression was markedly greater in the liver than in ovarian tissue and correlated with ongoing TCDD exposure. Aromatase, 17alpha-hydroxylase and LHR gene expressions were largely unchanged (or occasionally elevated) by TCDD. FoxA2 and FoxJ1 mRNAs were similarly of limited value mechanistically, although FoxJ1 was much higher in TTT females (receiving TCDD as donor, recipient and adult). This study reveals a particular sensitivity of the developing ovary to TCDD leading to early loss of reproductive function with age.((PMID:18159929))Xenobiotic and drug metabolism and transport are managed by a large number of genes coordinately regulated by at least three nuclear receptors or xenosensors: aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), and pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2). Initially characterized as xenosensors, it is now evident that CAR and PXR also trigger pleiotropic effects on liver function. Recent studies have shown the existence of crosstalk between xenosensors and other nuclear receptors or transcription factors controlling endogenous signaling pathways which regulate physiological functions. This review is focused on recent observations showing that activation of CAR and PXR alters lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation by interfering with HNF4alpha, FoxO1, FoxA2, PGC1alpha, or NFkB p65. Such crosstalks explain clinical observations and provide molecular mechanisms allowing understanding how xenobiotics and drugs may affect physiological functions and provoke endocrine disruptions.((PMID:15539409))Cytochrome P450 2A2 (CYP2A2) is an adult male-specific rat liver steroid hydroxylase whose sex-dependent expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by sexually dimorphic pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretory patterns. In contrast to CYP2C11 and other male-specific, plasma GH pulse-inducible liver genes, CYP2A2 is highly expressed in hypophysectomized rat liver, despite the absence of GH stimulation. CYP2A2 promoter fragments 0.9-6.2 kb long exhibited unusually high basal promoter activity when transfected into the liver cell line HepG2. A further approximately 2.5-fold increase in activity was obtained by cotransfection of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 3gamma or HNF4alpha. CYP2A2 promoter activity was inhibited approximately 85% by transfection of HNF3beta or HNF6, both of which are more highly expressed in female than male liver and can strongly trans-activate the female-specific CYP2C12 promoter. The male GH pulse-activated transcription factor STAT5b had no effect on CYP2A2 promoter activity, either alone or in combination with HNF3gamma and HNF4alpha, consistent with the GH pulse-independence of CYP2A2 expression. By contrast, STAT5b synergistically enhanced the transcriptional activity of HNF4alpha toward two other male-specific liver target genes, Cyp2d9 and CYP8B1. Furthermore, STAT5b in combination with the HNF4alpha coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha strongly enhanced the transcriptional activity of HNF4alpha toward CYP8B1 but not toward CYP2A2. These findings support the hypothesis that sex-dependent HNFs contribute to the sexually dimorphic expression of CYP2A2 and other liver CYPs and highlight the ability of STAT5b to act in concert with HNF4alpha to regulate select male-specific liver CYP genes.((PMID:22934771))Withdrawal of promising drug candidates is often due to the detection of liver toxicity. In particular the parenchymal liver cells or hepatocytes are targeted since they are the major sites of drug transport and of metabolite formation and thus also the place where not only detoxification, but also activation of new chemical (NCE) and biological (NBE) entities may occur. Therefore, primary hepatocyte- based cultures are currently the preferred in vitro model to screen for liver toxicity. However, within a few days, they undergo dedifferentiation with loss of liver-specific functionality, including xenobiotic biotransformation capacity, making them only suitable for short-term applications. A plausible alternative to primary hepatocyte cultures that can be maintained for longer periods of time could be the use of liver-derived epithelial cell lines and their optimized derivatives. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the stability and the hepatic differentiation potential of a neonatal liver-derived rat epithelial cell line from biliary origin (rLEC). Undifferentiated rLEC stably express the hepatic progenitor markers CEBPA, FOXA2, GJA1, ONECUT1, KRT18 and KRT19 for at least 15 consecutive passages after cryopreservation. Upon sequential exposure to hepatogenic growth factors and cytokines, rLEC generate functional hepatic progeny, expressing mature hepatic markers including Alb, Ahr, Car, C/ebpα, Cx32, Foxa2, Hnf1α, Hnf1β and Onecut1. Furthermore, an active polarization is observed for the hepatic drug transporters Oatp4 and Ntcp. rLEC-derived hepatic cells also acquire the ability to store glycogen, express genes encoding for key hepatic enzymes as shown by Affymetrix microarray data, and display stable CYP1A1/2- and CYP2B1/2-dependent activities for several weeks at levels comparable to those observed in cultured primary rat hepatocytes. The acquisition of such a stable and active biotransformation capacity is key for the applicability of liver-based in vitro models for long-term toxicity testing.((PMID:18305370))Nuclear receptors constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were originally characterized as transcription factors regulating the hepatic genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes. Recent works have now revealed that these nuclear receptors also play the critical roles in modulating hepatic energy metabolism. While CAR and PXR directly bind to their response sequences phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) and xenobiotic responsive enhancer module (XREM) in the promoter of target genes to increase drug metabolism, the receptors also cross talk with various hormone responsive transcription factors such as forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), cAMP-response element binding protein, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC 1alpha) to decrease energy metabolism through down-regulating gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis and up-regulating lipogenesis. In addition, CAR modulates thyroid hormone activity by regulating type 1 deiodinase in the regenerating liver. Thus, CAR and PXR are now placed at the crossroad where both xenobiotics and endogenous stimuli co-regulate liver function.((PMID:17909097))Metformin is an antidiabetic drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to determine whether metformin regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2).We assessed the regulation of hepatic SHP gene expression by Northern blot analysis with metformin and adenovirus containing a constitutive active form of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Ad-AMPK) and evaluated SHP, PEPCK, and G6Pase promoter activities via transient transfection assays in hepatocytes. Knockdown of SHP using siRNA SHP was conducted to characterize the metformin-induced inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocytes, and metformin-and adenovirus SHP (Ad-SHP)-mediated hepatic glucose production was measured in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice.Hepatic SHP gene expression was induced by metformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), and Ad-AMPK. Metformin-induced SHP gene expression was abolished by adenovirus containing the dominant negative form of AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK), as well as by compound C. Metformin inhibited hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha-or FoxA2-mediated promoter activity of PEPCK and G6Pase, and the inhibition was blocked with siRNA SHP. Additionally, SHP knockdown by adenovirus containing siRNA SHP inhibited metformin-mediated repression of cAMP/dexamethasone-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore, oral administration of metformin increased SHP mRNA levels in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice. Overexpression of SHP by Ad-SHP decreased blood glucose levels and hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in B6-Lep(ob/ob) mice.We have concluded that metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through AMPK-dependent regulation of SHP.((PMID:25858547))Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is a novel apolipoprotein that was discovered in 1999 and is bound primarily to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in the plasma. Multiple factors may influence its expression at both the post-transcriptional and the transcriptional levels both in vivo and ex vivo as follows: hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α, 4α (HNF-1α, 4α), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and platelet activating factor (PAF) upregulate its expression; liver X receptor (LXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and the majority of cytokines downregulate its expression. However, mechanisms underlying these processes remain unknown. Structurally, there exists a characterized hydrophobic binding pocket within the apoM protein, which enables it to bind functional lipids such as Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P). Functionally, it facilitates the formation of preβ-HDL and enhances an avalanche of atheroprotective effects exerted by HDL. Moreover, in patients with diabetes, the levels of plasma apoM may decrease, whereas the augmentation of apoM decreases plasma glucose levels and magnifies the secretion of insulin. This article offers a panorama of the progress made in the research regarding the characteristics of apoM, particularly the regulation of its expression and its functions.((PMID:26634639))Transdifferentiattion potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) has been suggested recently. In our recent works, we demonstrated the high performance of mouse neonate pancreas extract (MPE) in the production of functional IPCs from carcinoma stem cells. In this study, MPE was used to generate IPCs from MSCs without any genetic manipulation. To this end, bone marrow MSCs were isolated and characterized. In order to differentiate, MSCs were induced by selection of nestin-expressing cells and treatment with 100 μg/mL MPE. Morphological features of the differenti-ated cells were confirmed by dithizone staining. Immunoreactivity to insulin receptor beta, proinsulin, insulin, and C-peptide was observed by immunoflourescence. We also quantified glucose-dependent insulin production and secretion by ELISA. Real-time PCR indicated the expressions of β cell-related genes, PDX-1, INS1, INS2, EP300, and CREB1, in IPC cells. Possible pathways governed by CREB1, EP300, and PDX-1 transcription factors in differentiation of MSCs to IPCs were determined based on Gene Set Enrichment (GSE) approach at P = 0.05. Pathway discovery highlighted the negative regulatory effects of MIR124-2, HDAC5 protein, REST, and NR0B2 transcription factors on expression of CREB1, EP300, and PDX-1 and inhabitation of IPC differentiations. In contrast, a crosstalk between FOXA2 and TCF7L2 transcription factors, DNA-PK complex, KAT2B protein positively interacting with PDX-1, CREB1, EP300 resulted in the induction of IPC and following insulin production. In conclusion, we report an efficient, simple, and easy method for production of functional IPCs from MSCs by MPE treatment.((PMID:26093302))Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-mediated death. Although various therapeutic approaches are used for lung cancer treatment, these mainly target the tumor suppressor p53 transcription factor, which is involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, p53-targeted therapies have limited application in lung cancer, since p53 is found to be mutated in more than half of lung cancers. In this study, we propose tumor suppressor FOXA2 as an alternative target protein for therapies against lung cancer and reveal a possible FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network by identifying new target genes and binding partners of FOXA2 by using various screening techniques. The genes encoding Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2), nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2), cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) were identified as putative target genes of FOXA2. Additionally, the proteins including highly similar to heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90A), heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A variant (HSPA1A), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC3 were identified as novel interacting partners of FOXA2. Moreover, we showed that FOXA2-dependent promoter activation of BAX and p21 genes is significantly reduced via physical interactions between the identified binding partners and FOXA2. These results provide opportunities to understand the FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network and novel therapeutic targets to modulate this network in p53-deficient lung cancer.((PMID:24833708))Retinoic acid (RA) has diverse biological effects. The liver stores vitamin A, generates RA, and expresses receptors for RA. The current study examines the hepatic binding profile of two RA receptor isoforms, RARA (RARα) and RARB (RARβ), in response to RA treatment in mouse livers. Our data uncovered 35,521, and 14,968 genomic bindings for RARA and RARB, respectively. Each expressed unique and common bindings, implying their redundant and specific roles. RARB has higher RA responsiveness than RARB. RA treatment generated 18,821 novel RARB bindings but only 14,798 of RARA bindings, compared with the control group. RAR frequently bound the consensus hormone response element [HRE; (A/G)G(G/T)TCA], which often contained the motifs assigned to SP1, GABPA, and FOXA2, suggesting potential interactions between those transcriptional factors. Functional annotation coupled with principle component analysis revealed that the function of RAR target genes were motif dependent. Taken together, the cistrome of RARA and RARB revealed their extensive biological roles in the mouse liver. RAR target genes are enriched in various biological processes. The hepatic RAR genome-wide binding data can help us understand the global molecular mechanisms underlying RAR and RA-mediated gene and pathway regulation.((PMID:16467259))Previous studies from our group have shown that Foxa1 is expressed in the prostate and interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) to regulate prostate-specific genes such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and probasin (PB). We report here that Foxa2 but not Foxa1 is expressed in the epididymis. Further, Foxa2 interacts with the AR to regulate the mouse epididymal retinoic acid binding protein (mE-RABP) gene, an epididymis-specific gene. Binding of Foxa2 to the mE-RABP promoter was confirmed by gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Overexpression of Foxa2 suppresses androgen activation of the mE-RABP promoter while overexpression of Foxa2 with prostate-specific promoters activates gene expression in an androgen-independent manner. GST pull-down assays determined that both Foxa1 and Foxa2 physically interact with the DNA binding domain of the AR. The interaction between Foxa proteins and AR was further confirmed by gel-shift assays where Foxa protein was recruited to AR binding oligomers even when Foxa binding sites were not present, and AR was recruited to Foxa binding oligomers even in the absence of an AR binding site. Given that Foxa1 and Foxa2 proteins are expressed differentially in the prostate and epididymis, these data suggest that the Foxa proteins have distinct effects on AR-regulated genes in different male reproductive accessory organs.((PMID:11172038))Hepatotropism is a prominent feature of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Cell lines of nonhepatic origin do not independently support HBV replication. Here, we show that the nuclear hormone receptors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 and retinoid X receptor alpha plus peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, support HBV replication in nonhepatic cells by controlling pregenomic RNA synthesis, indicating these liver-enriched transcription factors control a unique molecular switch restricting viral tropism. In contrast, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 antagonizes nuclear hormone receptor-mediated viral replication, demonstrating distinct regulatory roles for these liver-enriched transcription factors.((PMID:9415428))Posterior neuropore (PNP) closure coincides with the end of gastrulation, marking the end of primary neurulation and primary body axis formation. Secondary neurulation and axis formation involve differentiation of the tail bud mesenchyme. Genetic control of the primary-secondary transition is not understood. We report a detailed analysis of gene expression in the caudal region of day 10 mouse embryos during primary neuropore closure. Embryos were collected at the 27-32 somite stage, fixed, processed for whole mount in situ hybridisation, and subsequently sectioned for a more detailed analysis. Genes selected for study include those involved in the key events of gastrulation and neurulation at earlier stages and more cranial levels. Patterns of expression within the tail bud, neural plate, recently closed neural tube, notochord, hindgut, mesoderm, and surface ectoderm are illustrated and described. Specifically, we report continuity of expression of the genes Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Evx1, Fgf8, RARgamma, Brachyury, and Hoxb1 from primitive streak and node into subpopulations of the tail bud and caudal axial structures. Within the caudal notochord, developing floorplate, and hindgut, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, Shh, and Brachyury expression domains correlate directly with known genetic roles and predicted tissue interdependence during induction and differentiation of these structures. The patterns of expression of Wnt5a, Hoxb1, Brachyury, RARgamma, and Evx1, together with observations on proliferation, reveal that the caudal mesoderm is organised at a molecular level into distinct domains delineated by longitudinal and transverse borders before histological differentiation. Expression of Wnt5a in the ventral ectodermal ridge supports previous evidence that this structure is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. These results provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms facilitating transition from primary to secondary body axis formation, as well as the factors involved in defective spinal neurulation.((PMID:9233805))The signalling molecule Sonic hedgehog is involved in a multitude of distinct patterning processes during vertebrate embryogenesis. In the nascent body axis of the zebrafish embryo, sonic hedgehog is co-expressed with axial (HNF3beta in mammals), a transcription regulator of the winged helix family. We show here that misexpression of axial leads to ectopic activation of sonic hedgehog expression in the zebrafish, suggesting that axial is a regulator of sonic hedgehog transcription. The sonic hedgehog gene was cloned from zebrafish and its promoter was characterized with respect to activation by axial. Expression of axial or rat HNF3beta in HeLa cells results in activation of co-transfected sonic hedgehog promoter-CAT fusion genes. This effect is mediated by two Axial (HNF3beta) recognition sequences. We furthermore identified a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the sonic hedgehog upstream region which can be bound by retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers in vitro and confers retinoic acid inducibility to the sonic hedgehog promoter in the HeLa cell system. Our results suggest that both Axial (HNF3beta) and retinoic acid receptors are direct regulators of the sonic hedgehog gene.((PMID:12834868))Treatment of pseudoglandular stage fetal lungs in vitro with the pan-retinoic acid receptor (pan-RAR) antagonist, BMS493, reduces retinoic acid receptor beta (Rarb) gene expression within the proximal bronchial tubules and increases explant bud formation. Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) increases Rarb expression and reduces explant bud formation through a signaling mechanism involving RARbeta. Together these data suggest that RA through RARbeta provides morphogenetic stabilizing activity to the proximal tubules during lung branching morphogenesis. Here we further investigate RA-mediated morphogenetic stabilization of the proximal respiratory tubules during fetal lung development. We demonstrate that Rarb isoform transcripts are the only known Rar transcripts to specifically localize to the proximal tubules and that RAREhsp68lacZ reporter transgene activity reveals endogenous RA signaling activity within these same proximal tubules. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the RA-producing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (Raldh1), as well as of transforming growth factor-3beta (Tgfb3), Foxa2, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Cftr) within the proximal tubules are all altered by the application of either RA or BMS493 in vitro. We therefore discuss an interbud/proximal tubule signaling niche involving feedback between Rarb expression and Raldh1-mediated synthesis of RA. We suggest that this feedback favors interbud morphogenetic stability by increasing expression of morphoregulatory molecules such as TGFbeta3 and Foxa2, thus promoting bronchial tubule formation rather than continual budding and branching. The relationship between this RAR signaling center and the previously described distal bud signaling center is also addressed.((PMID:17589789))Our goal is to decipher which DNA sequences are required for tissue-specific expression of epididymal genes. At least 6 epididymis-specific lipocalin genes are known. These are differently regulated and regionalized in the epididymis. Lipocalin 5 (Lcn5 or mE-RABP) and Lipocalin 8 (Lcn8 or mEP17) are homologous genes belonging to the epididymis-specific lipocalin gene cluster. Both the 5 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene and the 5.3 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn8 gene can direct transgene expression in the epididymis (Lcn5 to the distal caput and Lcn8 to the initial segment), indicating that these promoter fragments contain important cis-regulatory element(s) for epididymis-specific gene expression. To define further the fragments regulating gene expression, the Lcn5 promoter was examined in transgenic mice and immortalized epididymal cell lines. After serial deletion, the 1.8 kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene was sufficient for tissue-specific and region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Transient transfection analysis revealed that a transcription factor forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) interacts with androgen receptor and binds to the 100 bp fragment of the Lcn5 promoter between 1.2 kb and 1.3 kb and that Foxa2 expression inhibits androgen-dependent induction of the Lcn5 promoter activity. Immunohistochemistry indicated a restricted expression of Foxa2 in the epididymis where endogenous Lcn5 gene expression is suppressed and that the Foxa2 inhibition of the Lcn5 promoter is consistent with the lack of expression of Lcn5 in the corpus and cauda. Our approach provides a basic strategy for further analysis of the epididymal lipocalin gene regulation and flexible control of epididymal function.((PMID:16740652))Murine epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein [or lipocalin 5 (Lcn5)] is synthesized and secreted by the principal cells of the mouse middle/distal caput epididymidis. A 5-kb promoter fragment of the Lcn5 gene can dictate androgen-dependent and epididymis region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Here, we reported that the 1.8-kb Lcn5 promoter confers epididymis region-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. To decipher the mechanism that directs transcription, 14 chimeric constructs that sequentially removed 100 bp of 1.8-kb Lcn5 promoter were generated and transfected into epididymal cells and nonepididymal cells. Transient transfection analysis revealed that 1.3 kb promoter fragment gave the strongest response to androgens. Between the 1.2-kb to 1.3-kb region, two androgen receptor (AR) binding sites were identified. Adjacent to AR binding sites, a Foxa2 [Fox (Forkhead box) subclass A] binding site was confirmed by gel shift assay. Similar Foxa binding sites were also found on the promoters of human and rat Lcn5, indicating the Foxa binding site is conserved among species. We previously reported that among the three members of Foxa family, Foxa1 and Foxa3 were absent in the epididymis whereas Foxa2 was detected in epididymal principal cells. Here, we report that Foxa2 displays a region-specific expression pattern along the epididymis: no staining observed in initial segment, light staining in proximal caput, gradiently heavier staining in middle and distal caput, and strongest staining in corpus and cauda, regions with little or no expression of Lcn5. In transient transfection experiments, Foxa2 expression inhibits AR induction of the Lcn5 promoter, which is consistent with the lack of expression of Lcn5 in the corpus and cauda. We conclude that Foxa2 functions as a repressor that restricts AR regulation of Lcn5 to a segment-specific pattern in the epididymis.((PMID:25672890))It was recently reported that human periapical cysts (hPCys), a commonly occurring odontogenic cystic lesion of inflammatory origin, contain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. In this study, periapical inflammatory cysts were compared with dental pulp to determine whether this tissue may be an alternative accessible tissue source of MSCs that retain the potential for neurogenic differentiation. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis indicated that hPCy-MSCs and dental pulp stem cells spontaneously expressed the neuron-specific protein β-III tubulin and the neural stem-/astrocyte-specific protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in their basal state before differentiation occurs. Furthermore, undifferentiated hPCy-MSCs showed a higher expression of transcripts for neuronal markers (β-III tubulin, NF-M, MAP2) and neural-related transcription factors (MSX-1, Foxa2, En-1) as compared with dental pulp stem cells. After exposure to neurogenic differentiation conditions (neural media containing epidermal growth factor [EGF], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], and retinoic acid), the hPCy-MSCs showed enhanced expression of β-III tubulin and GFAP proteins, as well as increased expression of neurofilaments medium, neurofilaments heavy, and neuron-specific enolase at the transcript level. In addition, neurally differentiated hPCy-MSCs showed upregulated expression of the neural transcription factors Pitx3, Foxa2, Nurr1, and the dopamine-related genes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter. The present study demonstrated for the first time that hPCy-MSCs have a predisposition toward the neural phenotype that is increased when exposed to neural differentiation cues, based on upregulation of a comprehensive set of proteins and genes that define neuronal cells. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that hPCy-MSCs might be another optimal source of neural/glial cells for cell-based therapies to treat neurologic diseases.((PMID:21351873))The homeobox gene Noto is expressed in the node and its derivative the notochord. Here we use a targeted Noto-GFP reporter to isolate and characterize node/notochord-like cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. We find very few Noto-expressing cells after spontaneous differentiation. However, the number of Noto-expressing cells was increased when using Activin A to induce a Foxa2- and Brachyury-expressing progenitor population, whose further differentiation into Noto-expressing cells was improved by simultaneous inhibition of BMP, Wnt, and retinoic acid signaling. Noto-GFP(+) cells expressed the node/notochord markers Noto, Foxa2, Shh, Noggin, Chordin, Foxj1, and Brachyury; showed a vacuolarization characteristic of notochord cells; and can integrate into midline structures when grafted into Hensen's node of gastrulating chicken embryos. The ability to generate node/notochord-like cells in vitro will aid the biochemical characterization of these developmentally important structures.((PMID:16179348))Agonists for the nuclear receptor peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) and its heterodimeric partner, retinoid X receptor (RXR), are effective agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To gain insight into the antidiabetic action of these compounds, we treated female Zucker diabetic rats (ZFF) with AGN194204, which we show to be a homodimer-specific RXR agonist, or the PPARgamma agonist, troglitazone. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in ZFF showed that troglitazone and AGN194204 reduced basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) approximately 30% and doubled the insulin suppression of EGP. AGN194204 had no effect on peripheral glucose utilization, whereas troglitazone increased insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by 50%, glucose uptake into skeletal muscle by 85%, and de novo skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis by 300%. Troglitazone increased skeletal muscle Irs-1 and phospho-Akt levels following in vivo insulin treatment, whereas AGN194204 increased hepatic Irs-2 and insulin stimulated phospho-Akt in liver. Gene profiles of AGN194204-treated mouse liver analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified increases in fatty acid synthetic genes, including Srebp-1 and fatty acid synthase, a pathway previously shown to be induced by RXR agonists. A network of down-regulated genes containing Foxa2, Foxa3, and G-protein subunits was identified, and decreases in these mRNA levels were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Treatment of HepG2 cells with AGN194204 resulted in inhibition of glucagon-stimulated cAMP accumulation suggesting the G-protein down-regulation may provide an additional mechanism for hepatic insulin sensitization by RXR. These studies demonstrate distinct molecular events lead to insulin sensitization by high affinity RXR and PPARgamma agonists.((PMID:26704534))Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in multiple disease conditions and accumulating evidence supports that the variation in serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, including deficiency, is under strong genetic control. However, the underlying genetic mechanism associated with vitamin 25(OH)D concentrations is poorly understood. We earlier reported a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity in a Punjabi Sikh diabetic cohort as part of the Asian Indian diabetic heart study (AIDHS). Here we have performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of serum 25(OH)D on 3538 individuals from this Punjabi Sikh population. Our discovery GWAS comprised of 1387 subjects followed by validation of 24 putative SNPs (P<10(-4)) using an independent replication sample (n=2151) from the same population by direct genotyping. A novel locus at chromosome 20p11.21 represented by rs2207173 with minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.29, [β=-0.13, p=4.47×10(-9)] between FOXA2 and SSTR4 was identified to be associated with 25(OH)D levels. Another suggestive association signal at rs11586313 (MAF 0.54) [β=0.90; p=1.36×10(-6)] was found within the regulatory region of the IVL gene on chromosome 1q21.3. Additionally, our study replicated 3 of 5 known GWAS genes associated with 25(OH)D concentrations including GC (p=0.007) and CYP2R1 (p=0.019) reported in Europeans and the DAB1 (p=0.003), reported in Hispanics. Identification of novel association signals in biologically plausible regions with 25(OH)D metabolism will provide new molecular insights on genetic drivers of vitamin D status and its implications in health disparities.((PMID:26551672))We performed fine mapping of 39 established type 2 diabetes (T2D) loci in 27,206 cases and 57,574 controls of European ancestry. We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert their effects on disease.((PMID:25956617))GLUT2 is a bidirectional glucose transporter present in liver, kidney and pancreas. Studies have shown over-expression of GLUT2 in diabetic conditions. Ferulic acid (FA) is an antidiabetic phenolic phytocompound which is reported to regulate GLUT4 in vitro. The objective of our study is to evaluate the role of FA in the regulation of hepatic GLUT2 expression and the underlying mechanism. Male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: control, diabetic (diabetes was induced by giving high fat diet and high fructose water for 60 days), diabetic rats treated with FA (50mg/kg body weight/day, orally for 30 days), diabetic rats treated with metformin (50mg/kg body weight/day, orally for 30 days) and control rats treated with FA (50mg/kg body weight/day orally for 30 days). After 30 days treatment, animals were perfused and liver was dissected out. Glucose uptake and oxidation, expression of GLUT2 and binding of transcription factors - SREBP1c, HNF1α and HNF3β with GLUT2 gene promoter were studied. Over-expression of GLUT2 in hepatic tissue was found in high fat and fructose- induced type-2 diabetic animals. FA treatment reduced the GLUT2 expression in diabetic animals by impairing the interaction between these transcription factors (SREBP1c, HNF1α and HNF3β) and GLUT2 gene promoter.((PMID:25408296))MicroRNAs are a class of negative regulators of gene expression, which have been shown to be involved in the development of endocrine pancreas and in the regulation of insulin secretion. Since type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by beta cell dysfunction, we aimed at evaluating expression levels of miR-124a and miR-375, both involved in the control of beta cell function, in human pancreatic islets obtained from T2D and from age-matched non-diabetic organ donors.We analyzed miR-124a and miR-375 expression by real-time qRT-PCR in human pancreatic islets and evaluated the potential role of miR-124a by overexpressing or silencing such miRNA in MIN6 pseudoislets.We identified a major miR-124a hyperexpression in T2D human pancreatic islets with no differential expression of miR-375. Of note, miR-124a overexpression in MIN6 pseudoislets resulted in an impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, miR-124a silencing in MIN6 pseudoislets resulted in increased expression of predicted target genes (Mtpn, Foxa2, Flot2, Akt3, Sirt1 and NeuroD1) involved in beta cell function. For Mtpn and Foxa2, we further demonstrated the actual binding of miR-124a to their 3UTR sequences by luciferase assay.We uncovered a major hyperexpression of miR-124a in T2D islets, whose silencing resulted in increased expression of target genes of major importance for beta cell function and whose overexpression impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to the hypothesis that an altered miR-124a expression may contribute to beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.((PMID:25211022))Many of the type 2 diabetes loci identified through genome-wide association studies localize to non-protein-coding intronic and intergenic regions and likely contain variants that regulate gene transcription. The CDC123/CAMK1D type 2 diabetes association signal on chromosome 10 spans an intergenic region between CDC123 and CAMK1D and also overlaps the CDC123 3'UTR. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the association signal, we used open chromatin, histone modifications and transcription factor ChIP-seq data sets from type 2 diabetes-relevant cell types to identify SNPs overlapping predicted regulatory regions. Two regions containing type 2 diabetes-associated variants were tested for enhancer activity using luciferase reporter assays. One SNP, rs11257655, displayed allelic differences in transcriptional enhancer activity in 832/13 and MIN6 insulinoma cells as well as in human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The rs11257655 risk allele T showed greater transcriptional activity than the non-risk allele C in all cell types tested. Using electromobility shift and supershift assays we demonstrated that the rs11257655 risk allele showed allele-specific binding to FOXA1 and FOXA2. We validated FOXA1 and FOXA2 enrichment at the rs11257655 risk allele using allele-specific ChIP in human islets. These results suggest that rs11257655 affects transcriptional activity through altered binding of a protein complex that includes FOXA1 and FOXA2, providing a potential molecular mechanism at this GWAS locus.((PMID:24722248))MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as biomarkers of metabolic status, etiological factors in complex disease, and promising drug targets. Recent reports suggest that miRNAs are critical regulators of pathways underlying the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we demonstrate by deep sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR that hepatic levels of Foxa2 mRNA and miR-29 are elevated in a mouse model of diet-induced insulin resistance. We also show that Foxa2 and miR-29 are significantly upregulated in the livers of Zucker diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats and that the levels of both returned to normal upon treatment with the insulin-sensitizing agent pioglitazone. We present evidence that miR-29 expression in human hepatoma cells is controlled in part by FOXA2, which is known to play a critical role in hepatic energy homeostasis. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-29 fine-tunes FOXA2-mediated activation of key lipid metabolism genes, including PPARGC1A, HMGCS2, and ABHD5. These results suggest that miR-29 is an important regulatory factor in normal metabolism and may represent a novel therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes and related metabolic syndromes.((PMID:23349771))Obesity is an established risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and they are metabolically related through the mechanism of insulin resistance. In order to explore how common genetic variants associated with T2D correlate with body mass index (BMI), we examined the influence of 25 T2D associated loci on obesity risk. We used 5056 individuals (2528 sib-pairs) recruited in Indian Migration Study and conducted within sib-pair analysis for six obesity phenotypes. We found associations of variants in CXCR4 (rs932206) and HHEX (rs5015480) with higher body mass index (BMI) (β=0.13, p=0.001) and (β=0.09, p=0.002), respectively and weight (β=0.13, p=0.001) and (β=0.09, p=0.001), respectively. CXCR4 variant was also strongly associated with body fat (β=0.10, p=0.0004). In addition, we demonstrated associations of CXCR4 and HHEX with overweight/obesity (OR=1.6, p=0.003) and (OR=1.4, p=0.002), respectively, in 1333 sib-pairs (2666 individuals). We observed marginal evidence of associations between variants at six loci (TCF7L2, NGN3, FOXA2, LOC646279, FLJ39370 and THADA) and waist hip ratio (WHR), BMI and/or overweight which needs to be validated in larger set of samples. All the above findings were independent of daily energy consumption and physical activity level. The risk score estimates based on eight significant loci (including nominal associations) showed associations with WHR and body fat which were independent of BMI. In summary, we establish the role of T2D associated loci in influencing the measures of obesity in Indian population, suggesting common underlying pathophysiology across populations.((PMID:23014491))This study was conducted to determine whether dietary Se deficiency precluded overproduction of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) activity in mice overexpressing (OE) this gene and thus rescued their type 2 diabetes-like phenotypes. A total of 20 male OE and wild-type (WT) mice were fed an Se-deficient (<0.02 mg/kg) diet or an Se-supplemented (0.3 mg/kg as sodium selenite) diet from 1 to 5 mo of age. Dietary Se deficiency eliminated or attenuated (P < 0.05) genotype differences in concentrations of blood glucose, plasma insulin, and/or hepatic lipids, insulin sensitivity, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at the end of the study. Dietary Se deficiency decreased (P < 0.05) OE islet mRNA levels of 2 key transcriptional activators (Beta2 and Foxa2) and removed genotype differences in islet mRNA levels of 7 genes (Beta2, Cfos, Foxa2, Pregluc, Ins1, p53, and Sur1) related to insulin synthesis and secretion. Compared with those of the Se-adequate OE mice, the Se-deficient OE mice had lower (P < 0.05) hepatic mRNA levels of 2 key rate-limiting enzymes for lipogenesis (Acc1) and glycolysis (Gk1), along with lower (P < 0.05) activities of hepatic glucokinase and muscle phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Dietary Se deficiency also decreased (P < 0.05) blood glucose and hepatic lipid concentrations in the WT mice. In conclusion, dietary Se deficiency precluded the overproduction of GPX1 in full-fed OE mice and partially rescued their metabolic syndromes. This alleviation resulted from modulating the expression and/or function of proinsulin genes, lipogenesis rate-limiting enzyme genes, and key glycolysis and gluconeogenesis enzymes in islets, liver, and muscle.((PMID:22325233))Variations within the FOXA family have been studied for a putative contribution to the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and recently the minor T-allele of FOXA2 rs1209523 was reported to associate with decreased fasting plasma glucose levels in a study using a weighted false discovery rate control procedure to enhance the statistical power of genome wide association studies in detecting associations between low-frequency variants and a given trait.Thus, the primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the minor T-allele of rs1205923 in FOXA2 associated with 1) decreased fasting plasma glucose and 2) a lower risk of developing T2D. Secondly, we investigated whether rs1205923 in FOXA2 associated with other glucose-related phenotypes.The variant was genotyped in Danish individuals from four different study populations using KASPar(®) PCR SNP genotyping system. We examined for associations of the FOXA2 genotype with fasting plasma glucose and estimates of insulin release and insulin sensitivity following an oral glucose tolerance test in 6,162 Danish individuals from the population-based Inter99 study while association with T2D risk was assessed in 10,196 Danish individuals including four different study populations.The FOXA2 rs1209523 was not associated with fasting plasma glucose (effect size (β) = -0.03 mmol/l (95%CI: -0.07; 0.01), p = 0.2) in glucose-tolerant individuals from the general Danish population. Furthermore, when employing a case-control setting the variant showed no association with T2D (odds ratio (OR) = 0.82 (95%CI: 0.62-1.07), p = 0.1) among Danish individuals. However, when we performed the analysis in a subset of 6,022 non-obese individuals (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) an association with T2D was observed (OR = 0.68 (95%CI: 0.49-0.94), p = 0.02). Also, several indices of insulin release and β-cell function were associated with the minor T-allele of FOXA2 rs1209523 in non-obese individuals.We failed to replicate association of the minor T-allele of FOXA2 rs1209523 with fasting plasma glucose in a population based sample of glucose tolerant individuals. More extensive studies are needed in order to fully elucidate the potential role of FOXA2 in glucose homeostasis.((PMID:21841783))A connection between diet, obesity and diabetes exists in multiple species and is the basis of an escalating human health problem. The factors responsible provoke both insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction but remain to be fully identified. We report a combination of molecular events in human and mouse pancreatic beta cells, induced by elevated levels of free fatty acids or by administration of a high-fat diet with associated obesity, that comprise a pathogenic pathway to diabetes. Elevated concentrations of free fatty acids caused nuclear exclusion and reduced expression of the transcription factors FOXA2 and HNF1A in beta cells. This resulted in a deficit of GnT-4a glycosyltransferase expression in beta cells that produced signs of metabolic disease, including hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hepatic steatosis and diminished insulin action in muscle and adipose tissues. Protection from disease was conferred by enforced beta cell-specific GnT-4a protein glycosylation and involved the maintenance of glucose transporter expression and the preservation of glucose transport. We observed that this pathogenic process was active in human islet cells obtained from donors with type 2 diabetes; thus, illuminating a pathway to disease implicated in the diet- and obesity-associated component of type 2 diabetes mellitus.((PMID:20189175))Increased Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) production is a major feature of diabetic dyslipidemia with consequences on the metabolism of other lipoproteins such as Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) and High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). More precisely, we observe, in patients with type 2 diabetes, an increased production of VLDL(1) particles that is potentially detrimental by generating atherogenic remnants, small dense LDL particles and triglyceride-rich HDL particles. Several pathophysiological factors are responsible for increased VLDL production, in type 2 diabetes. Among those, insulin resistance plays an important role. Indeed, defective activation of PI3-kinase, secondary to insulin resistance, is associated with a reduction of apoB degradation in the hepatocytes, a rise in MTP expression (by increasing nuclear transcription factors Fox01 and Foxa2) and an increased activity of phospholipase D1 and ARF-1, which are involved in VLDL(1) formation. Moreover, peripheral insulin resistance is responsible for increased lipolysis of adipose tissue leading to augmented portal flux of FFA to the liver and, as a consequence, activation of VLDL production. In addition, increased de novo lipogenesis is observed in type 2 diabetes. This is secondary to increased activation of SREBP-1c (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1c), mainly by Endoplasmic Reticulum stress, and of ChREBP (Carbohydrate Responsive Element Binding Protein), mainly by hyperglycemia. Furthermore, decreased plasma adiponectin observed in type 2 diabetes, may also play a role in increased VLDL production by decreasing liver AMP-kinase activation and by increasing plasma FFA levels as a consequence of reduced muscle FFA oxidation.((PMID:20184103))Insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cell is critical to maintain glucose homeostasis. This secretion is impaired in type 1 diabetes, by beta cell autoimmune destruction, in type 2 diabetes, by multifactorial failures still not well determined, and in monogenic diabetes (MODY), by mutations in specific genes. During the last few years, several beta cell-specific transcription factors that regulate insulin synthesis and secretion in response to glucose have been discovered. Knockout mice studies for these genes and MODY diabetes demonstrate their importance for normal development and function of the beta cell. These factors are regulated not only in their expression by other genes, but also in their activity by other proteins and by post-translational modifications, therefore participating in physiologically important signaling pathways of the beta cell. The study of transcription factors is crucial for understanding the normal function of the beta cell, essential knowledge in developing new strategies for fighting diabetes.((PMID:18797817))Here, we examined the association of genetic variants of FOXA2, an upstream activator of the beta-cell transcription factor network, with type 2 diabetes and related phenotypes in North India. We genotyped three SNPs (rs1212275, rs1055080, rs6048205) and the (TCC)( n ) repeat polymorphism in 1,656 participants comprising 1,031 patients with type 2 diabetes and 625 controls. SNPs rs1212275 and rs6048205 were uncommon (MAF < 5%) with similar distribution among patients and controls. We found a strong association of (TCC)( n ) common allele A5 with type 2 diabetes [OR = 1.66 (95% CI 1.36-2.04, p = 5.9 x 10(-7)) for A5 homozygotes]. Obese individuals with A5A5 genotype had enhanced risk when segregated from normal-weight subjects [OR = 1.92 (95% CI 1.47-2.51), p = 1.6 x 10(-6)]. A5 was also nominally associated with higher fasting glucose (p = 0.02) and lower fasting insulin (p = 0.0028) and C-peptide (p = 0.036) levels among controls. At the rs1055080 locus, GG was found to provide reduced risk among normal-weight subjects [OR = 0.59 (95% CI 0.40-0.88), p = 0.011]. Combination of protective GG and non-risk genotypes of (TCC)( n ) showed reduced risk of type 2 diabetes both among normal-weight [OR = 0.43 (95% CI 0.29-0.65), p = 1.2 x 10(-6)] and obese individuals [0.47 (95% CI 0.34-0.64), p = 4.3 x 10(-5)]. For the first time we demonstrated that FOXA2 variants may affect risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits in North India, however replication analyses in other cohorts are required to confirm the findings.((PMID:18201205))Isosteviol (ISV), a diterpene molecule, is an isomer of the backbone structure of a group of substances with recently proven antidiabetic capabilities in both man and rodents. The aim of this study was to investigate if ISV possesses beneficial effects on the metabolism in the diabetic KKAy mouse and to establish the long-term in vivo effects of ISV on the gene expression profile of key insulin regulatory genes in islets.Twenty KKAy mice, aged 5 weeks, were divided into two groups and treated for 9 weeks with either (i) standard chow diet (control) or (ii) chow + 20 mg/kg body weight of ISV. Blood samples were collected before and after intervention and were subsequently analysed. As a non-diabetic control group, 10 normal C57BL mice were fed with standard chow diet. Gene expression was determined in islets by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Affymetrix microarray.We demonstrated that long-term treatment with ISV improves glucose homeostasis, increases insulin sensitivity, lowers plasma triglycerides and lowers weight in the diabetic KKAy mice. Furthermore, ISV markedly changes the gene expression profile of key insulin regulatory genes GLUT2, Ins1, Ins2, Pdx1/Ipf1, Beta2/Neurod1, Pax6 and 11-beta-HSD-1 and beta-cell transcription factors Nkx2-2, Nkx6-1, C/EBPalpha and FoxA2 in isolated islets of the KKAy mice.The results indicate that ISV improves glucose and insulin sensitivity as well as improving the lipid profile and upregulates the gene expression of key beta-cell genes, including insulin regulatory transcription factors.((PMID:16483925))VLDL levels are elevated in type II diabetes, where they contribute to the risk of coronary heart disease. A study by Wolfrum and Stoffel (2006) shows that the forkhead protein Foxa2 stimulates hepatic VLDL production in concert with the coactivator PGC-1beta and that insulin inhibits this process by inactivating Foxa2.((PMID:16397559))((PMID:15630453))Altered regulation of insulin secretion by glucose is characteristic of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the mechanisms that underlie this change remain unclear. We have now generated mice that lack the lambda isoform of PKC in pancreatic beta cells (betaPKClambda(-/-) mice) and show that these animals manifest impaired glucose tolerance and hypoinsulinemia. Furthermore, insulin secretion in response to high concentrations of glucose was impaired, whereas the basal rate of insulin release was increased, in islets isolated from betaPKClambda(-/-) mice. Neither the beta cell mass nor the islet insulin content of betaPKClambda(-/-) mice differed from that of control mice, however. The abundance of mRNAs for Glut2 and HNF3beta was reduced in islets of betaPKClambda(-/-) mice, and the expression of genes regulated by HNF3beta was also affected (that of Sur1 and Kir6.2 genes was reduced, whereas that of hexokinase 1 and hexokinase 2 genes was increased). Normalization of HNF3beta expression by infection of islets from betaPKClambda(-/-) mice with an adenoviral vector significantly reversed the defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These results indicate that PKClambda plays a prominent role in regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by modulating the expression of genes important for beta cell function.((PMID:15616540))((PMID:25301359))Liver is a vital organ and retains its regeneration capability throughout adulthood, which requires contributions from different cell populations, including liver precursors and intrahepatic stem cells. To overcome the mortality of hepatic progenitors (iHPs) in vitro, we aim to establish reversibly immortalized hepatic progenitor cells from mouse embryonic liver.Using retroviral system to stably express SV40 T antigen flanked with Cre/LoxP sites, we establish a repertoire of iHP clones with varied differentiation potential. The iHP cells maintain long-term proliferative activity and express varied levels of progenitor markers (Pou5f1/Oct4 and Dlk) and hepatocyte markers (AFP, Alb and ApoB). Five representative iHP clones express hepatic/pancreatic transcription factors HNF3α/Foxa1, HNF3β/Foxa2, and HNF4α/MODY1. Dexamethasone is shown to promote the expression of hepatocyte markers AFP and TAT, along with ICG-uptake and glycogen storage functions in the iHP clones. Cre-mediated removal of SV40 T antigen reverses the proliferative activity of iHP cells. When iHP cells are subcutaneously implanted in athymic nude mice, no tumor formation is observed for up to 8 weeks.We demonstrate that the established iHP cells are stable, reversible, and non-tumorigenic hepatic progenitor-like cells, which should be valuable for studying liver organogenesis, metabolic regulations, and hepatic lineage-specific differentiation.((PMID:11043867))Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3beta, a transcription factor expressed in pancreatic beta cells, is an upstream regulator of HNF-1alpha/MODY3, HNF-4alpha/MODY1 and IPF1/MODY5 genes. Our previous screening of MODY subjects showed that mutations in the HNF-3beta gene are not a common cause of this form of diabetes in the Japanese. We tested the hypothesis that mutations in the HNF-3beta gene cause late-onset Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in this population.Genotyping of the polymorphic TCC repeat in the HNF-3beta gene was done in 112 Japanese subjects with Type II diabetes (age at diagnosis > 35 and family history of Type II diabetes among their second-degree relatives) and 96 Japanese control subjects. Furthermore, we screened 57 Type II diabetic patients for mutations of the HNF-3beta gene. Transactivation activity of variant HNF-3beta was investigated by transfection assay.The distribution of alleles of the TCC repeat was similar between diabetic and control groups. Mutation screening identified two missense mutations, A86T and G114E. Neither mutation was observed in 225 control subjects. The transactivation activity of G114E-HNF-3beta was similar to that of wild typeHNF-3beta. In contrast, the activity of A86T-HNF-3beta was statistically significantly reduced to 83-86 % of that of wild type.The A86T mutation in the HNF-3beta gene might be involved in the development of late-onset Type II diabetes in a small group of Japanese people.((PMID:10672453))Molecular defects of the genes for transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 alpha, HNF-1 alpha, HNF-1 beta and insulin promoter factor-1 cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1, 3, 5, and 4, respectively). This suggests the HNF-related transcription cascade is important in insulin secretion which is induced by glucose. These genes and the gene encoding glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (MODY2) are, however, responsible for only 15-20% of cases of MODY in the Japanese. Searching for a novel form of MODY in this population, we cloned a new candidate gene encoding human HNF-3 beta, a winged helix transcription factor, which also belongs to the same HNF-transcription cascade.The cDNA clone for human HNF-3 beta was isolated from a liver cDNA library. The gene was also cloned from a genomic library and its organization and chromosomal localization were determined. We screened 68 Japanese subjects with MODY/early-onset diabetes for mutations in this gene.Human HNF-3 beta is composed of 457 amino acids. The human gene, which was mapped to the segment 30 cR from SHGC-37039 on chromosome 20p by radiation hybrid mapping, spans approximately 4.5 kb and consists of three exons. Direct sequencing of the exons and flanking regions identified one missense mutation A328 V and seven polymorphisms, although the functional significance of the mutation in the pathogenesis of diabetes is not known.The characterization of the structure of the HNF-3 beta gene and its mapping in the framework of markers will be helpful in genetic studies of the various forms of diabetes mellitus.((PMID:9231664))The genes encoding the functionally related hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha play a critical role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function. Mutations in these liver-enriched transcription factors result in two forms of early-onset type 2 diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY]), MODY3 and MODY1, which are characterized by impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, early disease onset, and autosomal dominant inheritance. The transcriptional hierarchy of HNFs suggests that other proteins of the regulatory cascade might be responsible for other forms of MODY and/or late-onset type 2 diabetes. In this study, we show that HNF-3alpha, -3beta, -3gamma, -4gamma, and -6 are expressed in pancreatic beta-cells. We report the identification and characterization of simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms in the genes encoding HNF-3alpha, -3beta, -3gamma, -4gamma, and -6 and the mapping of HNF-6 to chromosome bands 15q21.1-21.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These markers will be useful to study the role of genetic variation in these genes in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.((PMID:22960235))We describe the internal organization of murine embryoid bodies (EBs) in terms of the structures and cell types formed as Oct4 expression becomes progressively lost. This is done by making the EBs from iPS cells carrying a novel Oct4 reporter (Oct4-MerCreMer;mTmG) which is inducible, sensitive, and permanent in all cellular progeny. When these EBs are treated with tamoxifen, the Oct4 expressing cells switch from a red to a green fluorescence color, and this is maintained thereafter by all their progeny. We show that there is no specific pattern in which Oct4 is downregulated, rather it appears to be spatially random. Many of the earliest cells to lose Oct4 expression stain positive for markers of visceral endoderm (DAB2, α-fetoprotein (AFP), HNF4). These are randomly located, although if endoderm differentiation is allowed to commence before EB formation then an external layer is formed. This is true both of EBs made from the reporter iPS cells, or from an embryo-derived mouse ES line (R1 cells). Markers of the early body axis, Brachyury (BRA) and FOXA2, usually showed a concentration of positive cells in one region of the EB, but the morphology is not predictable and there are also scattered cells expressing these markers. These patterns are similar in R1 cells. Use of the Oct4 reporter showed a difference between BRA and FOXA2. BRA, which marks the early mesoderm, node and notochord, arises in Oct4 expressing cells on days 3-4. FOXA2, which marks the floor plate of the neural tube and definitive endoderm, as well as the node and notochord, arises at the same time but mostly in cells that have already lost Oct4 expression. Several clumps of cardiomyocytes are visible by days 7-8 of EB development, both in our iPS cells and in R1 cells. Using the Oct4 reporter we show that the cells forming these clumps lose Oct4 expression between days 3 and 5. Overall, our results indicate that EBs recapitulate normal development quite well in terms of the tempo of events and the appearance of specific markers, but they do not resemble embryos in terms of their morphology.((PMID:15057908))Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF) play a critical role in development of the liver. Their roles during liver tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are, however, poorly understood. To address the role of HNFs in tumor progression, we generated a new experimental model in which a highly differentiated slow-growing transplantable mouse HCC (sgHCC) rapidly gives rise in vivo to a highly invasive fast-growing dedifferentiated variant (fgHCC). This in vivo model has allowed us to investigate the fundamental mechanisms underlying HCC progression. A complete loss of cell polarity, a decrease in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, elevation of telomerase activity, and extinction of liver-specific gene expression accompanies tumor progression. Moreover, cells isolated from fgHCCs acquired the ability to proliferate rapidly in culture. These alterations were coupled with a reduced expression of several liver transcription factors including HNF4, a factor essential for hepatocyte differentiation. Forced re-expression of HNF4alpha1 in cultured fgHCC cells reversed the progressive phenotype and induced fgHCC cells to re-establish an epithelium and reform cell-ECM contacts. Moreover, fgHCC cells that expressed HNF4alpha1 also re-established expression of the profile of liver transcription factors and hepatic genes that are associated with a differentiated hepatocyte phenotype. Importantly, re-expression of HNF4alpha1 in fgHCC reduced the proliferation rate in vitro and diminished tumor formation in congenic recipient mice. In conclusion, loss of HNF4 expression is an important determinant of HCC progression. Forced expression of this factor can promote reversion of tumors toward a less invasive highly differentiated slow-growing phenotype.((PMID:12911579))Prothrombin is a key component in blood coagulation. Overexpression of prothrombin leads to an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Therefore, the study of the transcriptional regulation of the prothrombin gene may help to identify mechanisms of overexpression.The aim of our study was to localize the regions within the prothrombin enhancer responsible for its activity, to identify the proteins binding to these regions, and to establish their functional importance.We constructed a set of prothrombin promoter 5' deletion constructs containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, which were transiently transfected in HepG2, HuH7 and HeLa cells. Putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites were evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The functional importance of each TF binding site was evaluated by site directed mutagenesis and transient transfection of the mutant constructs.We confirmed the major contribution of the enhancer region to the transcriptional activity of the prothrombin promoter. Analysis of this region revealed putative binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF4, HNF3-beta and specificity protein(Sp)1. We identified six different TFs binding to three evolutionary conserved sites in the enhancer: HNF4-alpha (site 1), HNF1-alpha, HNF3-beta and an as yet unidentified TF (site 2) and the ubiquitously expressed TFs Sp1 and Sp3 (site 3). Mutagenesis studies showed that loss of binding of HNF3-beta resulted in a considerable decrease of enhancer activity, whereas loss of HNF4-alpha or Sp1/Sp3 resulted in milder reductions.The prothrombin enhancer plays a major role in regulation of prothrombin expression. Six different TFs are able to bind to this region. At least three of these TFs, HNF4-alpha, HNF3-beta and Sp1/Sp3, are important in regulation of prothrombin expression.((PMID:12163577))The nuclear hormone receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and the retinoid X alpha (RXRalpha) plus the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) heterodimer support hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in nonhepatoma cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) inhibits nuclear hormone receptor-mediated viral replication. Inhibition of HBV replication by HNF3beta is associated with the preferential reduction in the level of the pregenomic RNA compared with that of precore RNA. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), encoded by the precore RNA, mediates part of the inhibition of viral replication by HNF3beta. The amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of HNF3beta is essential for the inhibition of HBV replication. The activation of transcription by HNF3 from HBV promoters downstream from the nucleocapsid promoter appears to contribute indirectly to the reduction in the steady-state level of 3.5-kb HBV RNA, possibly by interfering with the elongation rate of these transcripts. Therefore, transcriptional interference mediated by HNF3 may also regulate HBV RNA synthesis and viral replication.((PMID:10194766))Complete induction of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription by glucocorticoids requires a complex glucocorticoid response unit (GRU). The GRU is comprised of two glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) and four accessory factor-binding sites [AF1, AF2, AF3, and cAMP response element (CRE)] that bind distinct transcription factors. Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) bind to the AF1 element and account for AF1 activity. Members of the hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) family bind to the AF2 element and provide AF2 activity. In this report, we show that the functions of AF1 and AF2 are dependent on their positions in the promoter, since they cannot substitute for each other nor can they be exchanged without a reduction in the response to glucocorticoids. We also identified the domains of HNF4 and HNF3 beta that are required for the AF1 and AF2 activities, respectively. The carboxy-terminal transactivation domain of HNF4 (amino acids 128-374) confers most of the AF1 activity, while the carboxyterminal transactivation domain of HNF3 beta (amino acids 361-458) mediates AF2 activity. These domains of HNF4 and HNF3 beta appear to have distinct roles in the response to glucocorticoids, as there are unique structural requirements for each, as judged by the failure of most other classes of transactivation domains to serve as accessory factors. These results suggest that the regulation of the PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids requires specific interactions between GR, accessory factors, and coactivators, and that the transactivation domains of AF1 and AF2 are of fundamental importance in the assembly of this multiprotein complex.((PMID:9462689))In the present study, we showed the role of the liver-enriched transcription factors in the transition during which proliferating hepatocytes become quiescent. We used primary rat hepatocytes cultured in modified L-15 medium. The cells proliferated and, after the addition of 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) from day 4, they stopped growing and gradually differentiated. During hepatic proliferation, expression of hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF)1alpha, HNF4, C/EBP alpha, and C/EBP beta mRNAs was depressed, whereas that of HNF3alpha and HNF3beta transcripts was enhanced. After the addition of DMSO, the expression of HNF1alpha, HNF3gamma, and HNF4 returned to the level in isolated cells and HNF1beta mRNA expression gradually increased. However, expression of C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta mRNAs was partially recovered. The mitoinhibitory agents, IL-1beta, IL-6, TGF-beta, and activin A, were examined to determine whether they could induce differentiation of proliferating hepatocytes as shown in cells treated with DMSO. Although these factors inhibited cell growth, the cells did not differentiate. The expression pattern of HNF3gamma mRNA was quite different in the cells cultured with DMSO and those cultured with cytokines. Therefore, hepatic differentiation requires not only inhibition of DNA synthesis but also induction of appropriate transcription factors. Thus, expression of HNF3gamma, C/EBP alpha, and C/EBP beta may be necessary for hepatocytes to acquire highly differentiated functions in addition to coexpression of certain amounts of transcripts of HNF1alpha, HNF1beta, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, and HNF4 as well as suppression of C/EBP delta.((PMID:9298246))Within the liver acinus the majority of genes are expressed in an ascending or descending gradient from the portal to the central vein. The regulatory factors involved in this spatial pattern of gene expression are still poorly understood. Many liver genes are regulated by liver-enriched transcription factors. Here we report on mRNA distribution of four transcription factors in cell lysates obtained from either the periportal or the perivenous region after zone-specific digitonin infusion and by in-situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis revealed that there were slightly more transcripts of C/EBP, HNF1 beta (n.s.) and HNF4 (p < 0.05), but fewer of HNF3 gamma (n.s.), in perivenous than in periportal lysates. A somewhat stronger staining in the perivenous region of HNF4 was also seen by in-situ hybridization. The moderate acinar zonation of the mRNAs of these transcription factors suggests that at best they could modulate but not govern the zonated expression of liver genes in the mature liver.((PMID:9199315))The transcription factors of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) family, which are active in the liver, are expressed early during endoderm differentiation. To study their involvement in early murine development, we examined their role in embryonic stem (ES) cells. HNF3alpha or HNF3beta mRNA transcripts were not detected in ES cells before differentiation, and only low levels of HNF3beta mRNA were detected at a late stage of differentiation of ES cells to embryoid bodies (EB) (20 days after induction of differentiation). To examine the consequences of overexpressing HNF3alpha or -beta in ES cells, we transfected the two genes into these cells and determined the levels of expression of tissue-specific genes during EB differentiation. Specifically, we examined expression of albumin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), alpha1-antitrypsin, transthyretin, zeta-globin, and neurofilament 68kd as markers for different cell lineages. Overexpression of HNF3beta (and to a lesser extent of HNF3alpha) induced the expression of genes associated with endodermal lineage, namely, the genes for CFTR and albumin, but did not induce the expression of genes involved in late endoderm differentiation, such as the genes for PEPCK and alpha1-antitrypsin. Moreover, expression of HNF1beta was highly induced in HNF3-overexpressing cells, while expression of HNF1alpha and HNF4 was only mildly induced in these cells. Therefore, HNF3alpha and -beta seem to be involved in early endoderm differentiation of ES cells and together with other developmental factors are apparently needed for the induction of the endodermal lineage in vivo.((PMID:7565696))Transcription of hepatocyte-specific genes requires the interaction of their regulatory regions with several nuclear factors. Among them is the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) family, composed of the HNF3 alpha, HNF3 beta, and HNF3 gamma proteins, which are expressed in the liver and have very similar fork head DNA binding domains. The regulatory regions of numerous hepatocyte-specific genes contain HNF3 binding sites. We examined the role of HNF3 proteins in the liver-specific phenotype by turning off the HNF3 activity in well-differentiated mhAT3F hepatoma cells. Cells were stably transfected with a vector allowing the synthesis of an HNF3 beta fragment consisting of the fork head DNA binding domain without the transactivating amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. The truncated protein was located in the nuclei of cultured hepatoma cells and competed with endogenous HNF3 proteins for binding to cognate DNA sites. Overproduction of this truncated protein, lacking any transactivating activity, induced a dramatic decrease in the expression of liver-specific genes, including those for albumin, transthyretin, transferrin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and aldolase B, whereas the expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene, containing no HNF3 binding sites, was unaltered. Neither were the concentrations of various liver-specific transcription factors (HNF3, HNF1, HNF4, and C/EBP alpha) affected. In partial revertants, with a lower ratio of truncated to full-length endogenous HNF3 proteins, previously extinguished genes were re-expressed. Thus, the transactivating domains of HNF3 proteins are needed for the proper expression of a set of liver-specific genes but not for expression of the genes encoding transcription factors found in differentiated hepatocytes.((PMID:7925467))The tissue-specific transcription factors of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4), hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF3), and liver factor B1 (LFB1) families are thought to play a role in the development of internal organs and in the tissue-specific expression of many distinct genes. We have now constructed derivatives of these proteins by introducing the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor and show that in transient transfections these chimeric proteins act as estrogen-inducible transcription factors with the DNA sequence specificity of the original factors. These chimeric transcription factors are differently affected by the partial estrogen antagonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen and the pure antiestrogen N-n-butyl-11-(3,17-dihydroxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-trien- 7 alpha-yl)N-methyl-undecamide (ICI 164384); 4-hydroxytamoxifen activates, at least partially, all the chimeric factors and the estrogen receptor, while ICI 164384 surprisingly activates the transcription factors derived from HNF3 and LFB1 and inhibits only the estrogen receptor and the HNF4 derivative. Together with the DNA-sequence-binding specificity, the different response to estrogen and anti-estrogens makes our estrogen receptor fusion proteins useful tools for the investigation of the roles of HNF4, HNF3 and LFB1 in gene expression, differentiation and developmental processes.((PMID:8027180))The oval cells are thought to be the progeny of a liver stem cell compartment and strong evidence now exists indicating that these cells can participate in liver regeneration by differentiating into different hepatic lineages. To better understand the regulation of this process we have studied the expression of liver-enriched transcriptional factors (HNF1 alpha and HNF1 beta, HNF3 alpha, HNF3 beta, and HNF3 gamma, HNF4, C/EBP, C/EBP beta, and DBP) in an experimental model of oval cell proliferation and differentiation and compared the expression of these factors to that observed during late stages of hepatic ontogenesis. The steady-state mRNA levels of four (HNF1 alpha, HNF3 alpha, HNF4, and C/EBP beta) "liver-enriched" transcriptional factors gradually decrease during the late period of embryonic liver development while three factors (HNF1 beta, HNF3 beta, and DBP) increase. In the normal adult rat liver the expression of all the transcription factors are restricted to the hepatocytes. However, during early stages of oval cell proliferation both small and large bile ducts start to express HNF1 alpha and HNF1 beta, HNF3 gamma, C/EBP, and DBP but not HNF4. At the later stages all of these factors are also highly expressed in the proliferating oval cells. Expression of HNF4 is first observed when the oval cells differentiate morphologically and functionally into hepatocytes and form basophilic foci. At that time the expression of some of the other factors is also further increased. Based on these data we suggest that the upregulation of the "establishment" factors (HNF1 and -3) may be an important step in oval cell activation. The high levels of these factors in the oval cells and embryonic hepatoblasts further substantiates the similarity between the two cell compartments. Furthermore, the data suggest that HNF4 may be responsible for the final commitment of a small portion of the oval cells to differentiate into hepatocytes which form the basophilic foci and eventually regenerate the liver parenchyma.((PMID:1870969))The transthyretin (TTR) gene is regulated by two DNA regions which elicit hepatocyte-specific expression: a proximal promoter and distal enhancer. The TTR promoter and enhancer are composed of at least eight DNA binding sites for three different hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), and AP-1/cJun. Site directed mutations within each of the HNF binding sites in the TTR promoter were introduced to evaluate their contribution to transcriptional activity in hepatoma cells. The data indicate that the strong affinity HNF-3-S binding site (-106 to -94) is absolutely required for TTR promoter activity since several mutations in this site eliminate TTR expression in the context of its enhancer. Conversion of a second weak affinity HNF3-W site (-140 to -131) in the TTR promoter to a high affinity site resulted in higher levels of expression. TTR mutations that disrupted several weak affinity sites (HNF1, HNF3-W, and HNF4) only slightly diminished expression levels in the presence of the TTR enhancer. In contrast, when we deleted the TTR enhancer from these HNF mutant constructs, TTR expression decreased to undetectable levels. This result suggests cooperation between the factors binding to the TTR promoter and enhancer regions. These results also demonstrate that the HNF3-S site alone is not sufficient to activate TTR transcription, but rather requires the participation of three cell-specific factors to elicit minimal promoter activity. The complexity of this promoter design and the requirement for a minimal number of cell-specific factors to achieve transcription allows us to propose a model which may explain the maintenance of tissue-specific expression of TTR.((PMID:1878351))To investigate the regulation of genes whose expression is enriched in liver we studied expression of the albumin and transthyretin (TTR) genes in a series of rat hepatoma cell lines (FaO, C2, C2rev7, and H5) that express these genes at different rates. The level of expression of albumin and TTR was compared to the expression and DNA-binding activity of four transcription factors, HNF1/LFB1, C/EBP, HNF3, and HNF4, that are found at high concentrations in liver. We conclude that the levels of these factors are controlled both transcriptionally (HNF-3, HNF-4, and C/EBP) and post-transcriptionally (HNF-1/LFB1), and that the cellular concentration of these DNA-binding proteins helps explain the level of transcriptional activity observed for the genes they regulate.((PMID:24157454))Solute carrier 2a2 (Slc2a2) gene codifies the glucose transporter GLUT2, a key protein for glucose flux in hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells of proximal tubule. In diabetes mellitus, hepatic and tubular glucose output has been related to Slc2a2/GLUT2 overexpression; and controlling the expression of this gene may be an important adjuvant way to improve glycemic homeostasis. Thus, the present study investigated transcriptional mechanisms involved in the diabetes-induced overexpression of the Slc2a2 gene.Hepatocyte nuclear factors 1α and 4α (HNF-1α and HNF-4α), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and the CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) mRNA expression (RT-PCR) and binding activity into the Slc2a2 promoter (electrophoretic mobility assay) were analyzed in the liver and kidney of diabetic and 6-day insulin-treated diabetic rats.Slc2a2/GLUT2 expression increased by more than 50% (P<0.001) in the liver and kidney of diabetic rats, and 6-day insulin treatment restores these values to those observed in non-diabetic animals. Similarly, the mRNA expression and the binding activity of HNF-1α, HNF-4α and FOXA2 increased by 50 to 100% (P<0.05 to P<0.001), also returning to values of non-diabetic rats after insulin treatment. Neither the Srebf1 and Cebpb mRNA expression, nor the SREBP-1c and C/EBP-β binding activity was altered in diabetic rats.HNF-1α, HNF-4α and FOXA2 transcriptional factors are involved in diabetes-induced overexpression of Slc2a2 gene in the liver and kidney. These data point out that these transcriptional factors are important targets to control GLUT2 expression in these tissues, which can contribute to glycemic homeostasis in diabetes.((PMID:23744720))Hepatocytes can be generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using inducers such as chemical compounds and cytokines, but issues related to low differentiation efficiencies remain to be resolved. Recent work has shown that overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors can directly cause cells phenotypic changes, including differentiation, trans-differentiation, and de-differentiation. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) could promote inducing mouse ESCs to hepatocyte-likes cells. First, ESC lines that stably expressed Foxa2, Hnf4a, or Foxa2/Hnf4a were constructed via lentiviral expression vectors. Second, observations of cell morphology changes were made during the cell culture process, followed by experiments examining teratoma formation. Then, the effects of constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a on hepatic differentiation and maturation were determined by measuring the marker gene expression levels of Albumin, α-fetoprotein, Cytokeratin18, and α1-antitrypsin. The results indicate that constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a does not affect ESCs culture, teratoma formation, or the expression levels of the specific hepatocyte genes under autonomous differentiation. However, with some assistance from inducing factors, Foxa2 significantly increased the hepatic differentiation of ESCs, whereas the expression of Hnf4a alone or Foxa2/Hnf4a could not. Differentiated CCE-Foxa2 cells were more superior in expressing several liver-specific markers and protein, storing glycogen than differentiated CCE cells. Therefore, our method employing the transduction of Foxa2 would be a valuable tool for the efficient generation of functional hepatocytes derived from ESCs.((PMID:25836733))Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is controlled by liver-enriched transcriptional factors, including forkhead box protein A (FOXA) members. Here, we found that FOXA members are directly and indirectly involved in HBV replication in human hepatic cells. HBV replication was elevated in HuH-7 treated with individual FOXA members-specific siRNA. Reciprocally, the downregulation of HBV replication was observed in FOXA-induced HuH-7. However, the mechanism of downregulation is different among FOXA members at the level of HBV RNA transcription, such as precore/pg RNA and 2.1 kb RNA. In addition, FOXA1 and FOXA2 suppressed nuclear hormone receptors, such as HNF4α, that are related to HBV replication.((PMID:25774505))The cause of organ failure is enigmatic for many degenerative diseases, including end-stage liver disease. Here, using a CCl4-induced rat model of irreversible and fatal hepatic failure, which also exhibits terminal changes in the extracellular matrix, we demonstrated that chronic injury stably reprograms the critical balance of transcription factors and that diseased and dedifferentiated cells can be returned to normal function by re-expression of critical transcription factors, a process similar to the type of reprogramming that induces somatic cells to become pluripotent or to change their cell lineage. Forced re-expression of the transcription factor HNF4α induced expression of the other hepatocyte-expressed transcription factors; restored functionality in terminally diseased hepatocytes isolated from CCl4-treated rats; and rapidly reversed fatal liver failure in CCl4-treated animals by restoring diseased hepatocytes rather than replacing them with new hepatocytes or stem cells. Together, the results of our study indicate that disruption of the transcription factor network and cellular dedifferentiation likely mediate terminal liver failure and suggest reinstatement of this network has therapeutic potential for correcting organ failure without cell replacement.((PMID:25263553))Cell fate acquisition is heavily influenced by direct interactions between master regulators and tissue-specific enhancers. However, it remains unclear how lineage-specifying transcription factors, which are often expressed in both progenitor and mature cell populations, influence cell differentiation. Using in vivo mouse liver development as a model, we identified thousands of enhancers that are bound by the master regulators HNF4A and FOXA2 in a differentiation-dependent manner, subject to chromatin remodeling, and associated with differentially expressed target genes. Enhancers exclusively occupied in the embryo were found to be responsive to developmentally regulated TEAD2 and coactivator YAP1. Our data suggest that Hippo signaling may affect hepatocyte differentiation by influencing HNF4A and FOXA2 interactions with temporal enhancers. In summary, transcription factor-enhancer interactions are not only tissue specific but also differentiation dependent, which is an important consideration for researchers studying cancer biology or mammalian development and/or using transformed cell lines.((PMID:23523371))Tissue-specific differentiation programs become dysregulated during cancer evolution. The transcription factor Nkx2-1 is a master regulator of pulmonary differentiation that is downregulated in poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. Here we use conditional murine genetics to determine how the identity of lung epithelial cells changes upon loss of their master cell-fate regulator. Nkx2-1 deletion in normal and neoplastic lungs causes not only loss of pulmonary identity but also conversion to a gastric lineage. Nkx2-1 is likely to maintain pulmonary identity by recruiting transcription factors Foxa1 and Foxa2 to lung-specific loci, thus preventing them from binding gastrointestinal targets. Nkx2-1-negative murine lung tumors mimic mucinous human lung adenocarcinomas, which express gastric markers. Loss of the gastrointestinal transcription factor Hnf4α leads to derepression of the embryonal proto-oncogene Hmga2 in Nkx2-1-negative tumors. These observations suggest that loss of both active and latent differentiation programs is required for tumors to reach a primitive, poorly differentiated state.((PMID:23070301))((PMID:22951069))The TCF7L2 transcription factor is linked to a variety of human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. One mechanism by which TCF7L2 could influence expression of genes involved in diverse diseases is by binding to distinct regulatory regions in different tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP-seq for TCF7L2 in six human cell lines.We identified 116,000 non-redundant TCF7L2 binding sites, with only 1,864 sites common to the six cell lines. Using ChIP-seq, we showed that many genomic regions that are marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac are also bound by TCF7L2, suggesting that TCF7L2 plays a critical role in enhancer activity. Bioinformatic analysis of the cell type-specific TCF7L2 binding sites revealed enrichment for multiple transcription factors, including HNF4alpha and FOXA2 motifs in HepG2 cells and the GATA3 motif in MCF7 cells. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that TCF7L2 co-localizes with HNF4alpha and FOXA2 in HepG2 cells and with GATA3 in MCF7 cells. Interestingly, in MCF7 cells the TCF7L2 motif is enriched in most TCF7L2 sites but is not enriched in the sites bound by both GATA3 and TCF7L2. This analysis suggested that GATA3 might tether TCF7L2 to the genome at these sites. To test this hypothesis, we depleted GATA3 in MCF7 cells and showed that TCF7L2 binding was lost at a subset of sites. RNA-seq analysis suggested that TCF7L2 represses transcription when tethered to the genome via GATA3.Our studies demonstrate a novel relationship between GATA3 and TCF7L2, and reveal important insights into TCF7L2-mediated gene regulation.((PMID:21716291))The location and timing of cellular differentiation must be stringently controlled for proper organ formation. Normally, hepatocytes differentiate from hepatic progenitor cells to form the liver during development. However, previous studies have shown that the hepatic program can also be activated in non-hepatic lineage cells after exposure to particular stimuli or fusion with hepatocytes. These unexpected findings suggest that factors critical to hepatocyte differentiation exist and become activated to induce hepatocyte-specific properties in different cell types. Here, by screening the effects of twelve candidate factors, we identify three specific combinations of two transcription factors, comprising Hnf4α plus Foxa1, Foxa2 or Foxa3, that can convert mouse embryonic and adult fibroblasts into cells that closely resemble hepatocytes in vitro. The induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells have multiple hepatocyte-specific features and reconstitute damaged hepatic tissues after transplantation. The generation of iHep cells may provide insights into the molecular nature of hepatocyte differentiation and potential therapies for liver diseases.((PMID:20712053))To investigate the gene expression pattern of hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) and other liver-enriched transcription factors in various segments of the human intestine to better understand the differentiation of the gut epithelium.Samples of healthy duodenum and jejunum were obtained from patients with pancreatic cancer whereas ileum and colon was obtained from patients undergoing right or left hemicolectomy or (recto)sigmoid or rectal resection. All surgical specimens were subjected to histopathology. Excised tissue was shock-frozen and analyzed for gene expression of liver-enriched transcription factors by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain and compared to the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2. Protein expression of major liver-enriched transcription factors was determined by Western blotting while the DNA binding of HNF6 was investigated by electromobility shift assays.The gene expression patterning of liver-enriched transcription factors differed in the various segments of the human intestine with HNF6 gene expression being most abundant in the duodenum (P < 0.05) whereas expression of the zinc finger protein GATA4 and of the HNF6 target gene ALDH3A1 was most abundant in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Likewise, expression of FOXA2 and the splice variants 2 and 4 of HNF4alpha were most abundantly expressed in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Essentially, expression of transcription factors declined from the duodenum towards the colon with the most abundant expression in the jejunum and less in the ileum. The expression of HNF6 and of genes targeted by this factor, i.e. neurogenin 3 (NGN3) was most abundant in the jejunum followed by the ileum and the colon while DNA binding activity of HNF4alpha and of NGN3 was confirmed by electromobility shift assays to an optimized probe. Furthermore, Western blotting provided evidence of the expression of several liver-enriched transcription factors in cultures of colon epithelial cells, albeit at different levels.We describe significant local and segmental differences in the expression of liver-enriched transcription factors in the human intestine which impact epithelial cell biology of the gut.((PMID:20551221))The liver and pancreas share a common origin and coexpress several transcription factors. To gain insight into the transcriptional networks regulating the function of these tissues, we globally identify binding sites for FOXA2 in adult mouse islets and liver, PDX1 in islets, and HNF4A in liver. Because most eukaryotic transcription factors bind thousands of loci, many of which are thought to be inactive, methods that can discriminate functionally active binding events are essential for the interpretation of genome-wide transcription factor binding data. To develop such a method, we also generated genome-wide H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 localization data in these tissues. By analyzing our binding and histone methylation data in combination with comprehensive gene expression data, we show that H3K4me1 enrichment profiles discriminate transcription factor occupied loci into three classes: those that are functionally active, those that are poised for activation, and those that reflect pioneer-like transcription factor activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regulated presence of H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes at transcription factor occupied promoters and enhancers controls their activity, implicating both tissue-specific transcription factor binding and nucleosome remodeling complex recruitment in determining tissue-specific gene expression. Finally, we apply these approaches to generate novel insights into how FOXA2, PDX1, and HNF4A cooperate to drive islet- and liver-specific gene expression.((PMID:19822575))Gene expression is regulated by combinations of transcription factors, which can be mapped to regulatory elements on a genome-wide scale using ChIP experiments. In a previous ChIP-chip study of USF1 and USF2 we found evidence also of binding of GABP, FOXA2 and HNF4a within the enriched regions. Here, we have applied ChIP-seq for these transcription factors and identified 3064 peaks of enrichment for GABP, 7266 for FOXA2 and 18783 for HNF4a. Distal elements with USF2 signal was frequently bound also by HNF4a and FOXA2. GABP peaks were found at transcription start sites, whereas 94% of FOXA2 and 90% of HNF4a peaks were located at other positions. We developed a method to accurately define TFBS within peaks, and found the predicted sites to have an elevated conservation level compared to peak centers; however the majority of bindings were not evolutionary conserved. An interaction between HNF4a and GABP was seen at TSS, with one-third of the HNF4a positive promoters being bound also by GABP, and this interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitations.((PMID:19478084))Forkhead factors are important regulators of animal development and homeostasis. They are among the earliest to bind quiescent genes, which they activate in conjunction with other transcription factors. Many liver-specific genes are under the control of FoxA2, a liver-enriched forkhead protein. Here we confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation that FoxA2 is one of the factors bound to the promoter-proximal enhancer of the gene encoding apolipoprotein AI (a component of high density lipoprotein) and that it functions in synergy with the nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha. Furthermore, toward identifying additional cofactors that could potentially regulate FoxA2 activity, we identified DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a FoxA2-associated factor upon affinity purification of epitope-tagged FoxA2. We show that FoxA2, found to be a phosphoprotein in vivo, is also an efficient substrate for DNA-PK, which targets serine 283. This residue is contained within a conserved serine-glutamine phosphorylation signal for DNA-PK, located within the C-terminal third of the polypeptide, just distal to its winged-helix DNA binding domain. We establish that this residue is critical for FoxA2 function because FoxA2 bearing a mutation at this site is severely compromised in its ability to activate a reporter gene under the control of its cognate DNA-binding site (apoAI site B). Complementary experiments rule out that this mutation compromises the ability of FoxA2 to either translocate to the nucleus or to bind site B. We therefore conclude that DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of FoxA2 plays a critical role in its transcriptional activation function per se.((PMID:17529977))We demonstrate that the binding sites for highly conserved transcription factors vary extensively between human and mouse. We mapped the binding of four tissue-specific transcription factors (FOXA2, HNF1A, HNF4A and HNF6) to 4,000 orthologous gene pairs in hepatocytes purified from human and mouse livers. Despite the conserved function of these factors, from 41% to 89% of their binding events seem to be species specific. When the same protein binds the promoters of orthologous genes, approximately two-thirds of the binding sites do not align.((PMID:14988544))((PMID:27044799))The hepatocyte nuclear factors, Hnf1a and Hnf4a, in addition to playing key roles in determining hepatocyte fate, have been implicated as candidate lineage-determining transcription factors in the kidney proximal tubule (PT) [Martovetsky et. al., (2012) Mol Pharmacol 84:808], implying an additional level of regulation that is potentially important in developmental and/or tissue-engineering contexts. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transduced with Hnf1a and Hnf4a form tight junctions and express multiple PT drug transporters (e.g., Slc22a6/Oat1, Slc47a1/Mate1, Slc22a12/Urat1, Abcg2/Bcrp, Abcc2/Mrp2, Abcc4/Mrp4), nutrient transporters (e.g., Slc34a1/NaPi-2, Slco1a6), and tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin 6, ZO-1/Tjp1, ZO-2/Tjp2). In contrast, the coexpression (with Hnf1a and Hnf4a) of GATA binding protein 4 (Gata4), as well as the forkhead box transcription factors, Foxa2 and Foxa3, in MEFs not only downregulates PT markers but also leads to upregulation of several hepatocyte markers, including albumin, apolipoprotein, and transferrin. A similar result was obtained with primary mouse PT cells. Thus, the presence of Gata4 and Foxa2/Foxa3 appears to alter the effect of Hnf1a and Hnf4a by an as-yet unidentified mechanism, leading toward the generation of more hepatocyte-like cells as opposed to cells exhibiting PT characteristics. The different roles of Hnf4a in the kidney and liver was further supported by reanalysis of ChIP-seq data, which revealed Hnf4a colocalization in the kidney near PT-enriched genes compared with those genes enriched in the liver. These findings provide valuable insight, not only into the developmental, and perhaps organotypic, regulation of drug transporters, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and tight junctions, but also for regenerative medicine strategies aimed at restoring the function of the liver and/or kidney (acute kidney injury, AKI; chronic kidney disease, CKD).((PMID:23324445))Cytokine-activated transcription factors from the STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) family control common and context-specific genetic programs. It is not clear to what extent cell-specific features determine the binding capacity of seven STAT members and to what degree they share genetic targets. Molecular insight into the biology of STATs was gained from a meta-analysis of 29 available ChIP-seq data sets covering genome-wide occupancy of STATs 1, 3, 4, 5A, 5B and 6 in several cell types.We determined that the genomic binding capacity of STATs is primarily defined by the cell type and to a lesser extent by individual family members. For example, the overlap of shared binding sites between STATs 3 and 5 in T cells is greater than that between STAT5 in T cells and non-T cells. Even for the top 1,000 highly enriched STAT binding sites, ~15% of STAT5 binding sites in mouse female liver are shared by other STATs in different cell types while in T cells ~90% of STAT5 binding sites are co-occupied by STAT3, STAT4 and STAT6. In addition, we identified 116 cis-regulatory modules (CRM), which are recognized by all STAT members across cell types defining a common JAK-STAT signature. Lastly, in liver STAT5 binding significantly coincides with binding of the cell-specific transcription factors HNF4A, FOXA1 and FOXA2 and is associated with cell-type specific gene transcription.Our results suggest that genomic binding of STATs is primarily determined by the cell type and further specificity is achieved in part by juxtaposed binding of cell-specific transcription factors.((PMID:21775309))ChIP-seq data are enriched in binding sites for the protein immunoprecipitated. Some sequences may also contain binding sites for a coregulator. Biologists are interested in knowing which coregulatory factor motifs may be present in the sequences bound by the protein ChIP'ed.We present a finite mixture framework with an expectation-maximization algorithm that considers two motifs jointly and simultaneously determines which sequences contain both motifs, either one or neither of them. Tested on 10 simulated ChIP-seq datasets, our method performed better than repeated application of MEME in predicting sequences containing both motifs. When applied to a mouse liver Foxa2 ChIP-seq dataset involving ~ 12 000 400-bp sequences, coMOTIF identified co-occurrence of Foxa2 with Hnf4a, Cebpa, E-box, Ap1/Maf or Sp1 motifs in ~6-33% of these sequences. These motifs are either known as liver-specific transcription factors or have an important role in liver function.Freely available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/comotif/.li3@niehs.nih.govSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.((PMID:20576918))Biliary epithelial cells (BEC) are morphologically and functionally heterogeneous. To investigate the molecular mechanism for their diversities, we test the hypothesis that large and small BEC have disparity in their target gene response to their transcriptional regulator, the biliary cell-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF6. The expression of the major HNF (HNF6, OC2, HNF1b, HNF1a, HNF4a, C/EBPb, and Foxa2) and representative biliary transport target genes that are HNF dependent were compared between SV40-transformed BEC derived from large (SV40LG) and small (SV40SM) ducts, before and after treatment with recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing HNF6 (AdHNF6) or control LacZ cDNA (AdLacZ). Large and small BEC were isolated from mouse liver treated with growth hormone, a known transcriptional activator of HNF6, and the effects on selected target genes were examined. Constitutive Foxa2, HNF1a, and HNF4a gene expression were 2.3-, 12.4-, and 2.6-fold, respectively, higher in SV40SM cells. This was associated with 2.7- and 4-fold higher baseline expression of HNF1a- and HNF4a-regulated ntcp and oatp1 genes, respectively. Following AdHNF6 infection, HNF6 gene expression was 1.4-fold higher (P = 0.02) in AdHNF6 SV40SM relative to AdHNF6 SV40LG cells, with a corresponding higher Foxa2 (4-fold), HNF1a (15-fold), and HNF4a (6-fold) gene expression in AdHNF6-SV40SM over AdHNF6-SV40LG. The net effects were upregulation of HNF6 target gene glucokinase and of Foxa2, HNF1a, and HNF4a target genes oatp1, ntcp, and mrp2 over AdLacZ control in both cells, but with higher levels in AdH6-SV40SM over AdH6-SV40LG of glucokinase, oatp1, ntcp, and mrp2 (by 1.8-, 3.4-, 2.4-, and 2.5-fold, respectively). In vivo, growth hormone-mediated increase in HNF6 expression was associated with similar higher upregulation of glucokinase and mrp2 in cholangiocytes from small vs. large BEC. Small and large BEC have a distinct profile of hepatocyte transcription factor and cognate target gene expression, as well as differential strength of response to transcriptional regulation, thus providing a potential molecular basis for their divergent function.((PMID:20297663))The expression of genes Sox2, Klf4, Myc, Sall4, Gata6, Foxa2, Hnf4a, Cdx2, Esrrb, Hand1 in cultivated cells, embryos and organs of adult voles Microtus rossiaemeridionalis was studied. High resemblance of the expression patterns of these genes in the organs of adult voles, mice and humans was demonstrated. It was established that genes Gata6, Foxa2 and Hnf4a were specifically expressed in vole extraembryonic endoderm cells, while Cdx2 and Handl genes, in trophoblast stem cells. This shows that these genes can be used markers for corresponding vole cell lines. Indirect confirmation pointing to the fact that Oct4 gene is a marker gene for epiblast cells both in the vole and mouse was obtained.((PMID:19934400))Variability in hepatic CYP3A4 cannot be explained by common CYP3A4 coding variants. We previously identified polymorphisms in pregnane X receptor (PXR) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) associated with CYP3A4 mRNA levels in small cohorts of human livers. However, the relative contributions of these genetic variations or of polymorphisms in other CYP3A4 regulators to variable CYP3A4 expression were not known. We phenotyped livers from white donors (n = 128) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 and nine transcriptional regulators, coactivators, and corepressors. We resequenced hepatic nuclear factor-3-beta (HNF3beta, FoxA2), HNF4alpha, HNF3gamma (FoxA3), nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCoR2), and regions of the CYP3A4 promoter and genotyped informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PXR and ABCB1 in the same livers. CYP3A4 mRNA was positively correlated with PXR and FoxA2 and negatively correlated with NCoR2 mRNA. A common silent polymorphism and a polymorphic trinucleotide (CCT) repeat in FoxA2 were associated with CYP3A4 expression. The transcriptional activity of the FoxA2 polymorphic CCT repeat alleles (wild-type, n = 14 and variant, n = 13, 15, and 19) when assayed by luciferase reporter transactivation assays was greatest for the wild-type repeat, with deviations from this number having decreased transcriptional activity. This corresponded with higher expression of FoxA2 mRNA and its targets PXR and CYP3A4 in human livers with (CCT) n = 14 genotypes. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the contributions of selected genetic polymorphisms to variable CYP3A4 expression. This approach identified sex and polymorphisms in FoxA2, HNF4alpha, FoxA3, PXR, ABCB1, and the CYP3A4 promoter that together explained as much as 24.6% of the variation in hepatic CYP3A4 expression.((PMID:17925385))The hypothesis was tested that sequence diversity in pregnane X receptor (PXR) cis-regulatory regions is a significant determinant of variation in inducible and constitutive CYP3A4 expression. A combination of comparative genomics and computational algorithms was used to select regions of the human PXR promoter and intron 1 that were resequenced in the polymorphism discovery resource 24 DNA subset. PXR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were then genotyped in donor human livers phenotyped for CYP3A4 and multidrug resistance protein 1 mRNA and primary human hepatocytes phenotyped for basal and rifampin-inducible CYP3A4 activity. The human PXR promoter [16.9 kilobase (kb)] was significantly larger than in rodents (2.9 kb). Eighty-nine SNPs were identified in the promoter and intron 1 of PXR. The SNPs most consistently associated with CYP3A4 phenotypic measures were a 44477T>C(-1359) promoter SNP (in linkage disequilibrium with SNP 463970, a 6-base pair deletion in intron 1a, and SNP 46551, a C nucleotide insertion in intron 1b); SNP 63396C>T in intron 1 (in linkage disequilibrium with SNP 63704A>G, a 63813(CAAA)(CA) variable repeat, and SNP 65104T>C); and SNP 56348C>A, SNP 69789A>G, and SNP 66034T>C. Donor livers with the variant PXR alleles had altered hepatic expression of PXR targets compared with livers with PXR wild-type alleles. These results identified PXR promoter and intron 1 SNPs associated with PXR target gene expression (CYP3A4) in donor livers and cultured hepatocytes and that a striking number of the linked intron 1 SNPs will affect putative binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor 3beta (FOXA2), a transcription factor linked with PXR expression.((PMID:17267396))Upon drug activation, the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates not only hepatic drug but also energy metabolism. Using Pxr(-/-) mice, we have now investigated the PXR-mediated repression of lipid metabolism in the fasting livers. Treatment with PXR activator pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PCN) down-regulated the mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (in beta-oxidation) and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-CoA synthase 2 (in ketogenesis) in wild-type (Pxr(+/+)) mice only. In contrast, the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (in lipogenesis) mRNA was up-regulated in the PCN-treated Pxr(+/+) mice. Reflecting these up- and down-regulations and consistent with decreased energy metabolism, the levels of hepatic triglycerides and of serum 3-hydroxybutylate were increased and decreased, respectively, in the PCN-treated Pxr(+/+) mice. Using gel shift, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and cell-based reporter assays, we then examined whether PXR could cross-talk with the insulin response forkhead factor FoxA2 to repress the transcription of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 genes, because FoxA2 activates these genes in fasting liver. PXR directly bound to FoxA2 and repressed its activation of the Cpt1a and Hmgcs2 promoters. Moreover, ChIP assays showed that PCN treatment attenuated the binding of FoxA2 to these promoters in fasting Pxr(+/+) but not Pxr(-/-) mice. These results are consistent with the conclusion that PCN-activated PXR represses FoxA2-mediated transcription of Ctp1a and Hmgcs2 genes in fasting liver.((PMID:15100175))Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the major cytochrome P450 present in adult human liver and is involved in the metabolism of over 50% of therapeutic compounds currently in use. Since expression levels of CYP3A4 are regulated by many of these compounds, this raises the potential for drug-drug interactions and subsequent altered efficacy or toxicity of the individual compounds at the dose prescribed. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of CYP3A4 regulation is of key importance in predicting and understanding such interactions. To examine this we have used DNase I footprinting and bioinformatic analysis to identify putative transcription factor binding sites within the 250 base pairs of promoter proximal to the transcription start site. We identified several protected fragments within this region that corresponded to putative binding sites for Sp1, AP2, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha), and hepatic nuclear factor-3 (HNF3), as well as confirming previously identified C/EBPalpha, pregnane X receptor (PXR), and HNF3 binding sites. Sequential site-directed mutagenesis of C/EBPalpha, Sp1, HNF3, and PXR binding sites was next used to examine the role of these sites in basal CYP3A4 expression. Disruption of the C/EBPalpha, HNF3, and PXR binding sites all affected basal expression. Finally, the role of these sites was examined in activation of CYP3A4 expression by rifampicin, metyrapone, clotrimazole, and phenobarbital. Disruption of any of these sites either led to an altered pattern of activation by the xenobiotic, as altered maximal activation, or altered the EC(50) value of activation. Such effects were xenobiotic-specific, with each disrupted site playing a role in the activation of some of the xenobiotics.((PMID:23828045))Streptozotocin (STZ), a glucosamine-nitrosourea compound, has potent genotoxic effects on pancreatic β-cells and is frequently used to induce diabetes in experimental animals. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has β-cell protective effects and is known to preserve β-cells from STZ treatment. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of STZ-induced diabetes and GLP-1-mediated β-cell protection in STZ-treated mice. At 1 week after multiple low-dose STZ administrations, pancreatic β-cells showed impaired insulin expression, while maintaining expression of nuclear Nkx6.1. This was accompanied by significant upregulation of p53-responsive genes in islets, including a mediator of cell cycle arrest, p21 (also known as Waf1 and Cip1). STZ treatment also suppressed expression of a wide range of genes linked with key β-cell functions or diabetes development, such as G6pc2, Slc2a2 (Glut2), Slc30a8, Neurod1, Ucn3, Gad1, Isl1, Foxa2, Vdr, Pdx1, Fkbp1b and Abcc8, suggesting global β-cell defects in STZ-treated islets. The Tmem229B, Prss53 and Ttc28 genes were highly expressed in untreated islets and strongly suppressed by STZ, suggesting their potential roles in β-cell function. When a pancreas-targeted adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector was employed for long-term Glp-1 gene delivery, pancreatic GLP-1 expression protected mice from STZ-induced diabetes through preservation of the β-cell mass. Despite its potent β-cell protective effects, however, pancreatic GLP-1 overexpression showed limited effects on the global gene expression profiles in the islets. Network analysis identified the programmed-cell-death-associated pathways as the most relevant network in Glp-1 gene therapy. Upon pancreatic GLP-1 expression, upregulation of Cxcl13 and Nptx2 was observed in STZ-damaged islets, but not in untreated normal islets. Given the pro-β-cell-survival effects of Cxcl12 (Sdf-1) in inducing GLP-1 production in α-cells, pancreatic GLP-1-mediated Cxcl13 induction might also play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of β-cells in damaged islets.((PMID:15123725))Although the negative regulation of gene expression by insulin has been widely studied, the transcription factors responsible for the insulin effect are still unknown. The purpose of this work was to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the insulin repression of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) gene. Deletion analysis of the 5'-regulatory region allowed us to identify an insulin-responsive region located at -459 to -354 bp. This fragment contains a highly homologous insulin-responsive (IRE) sequence. By transient transfection assays, we determined that hepatic nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1) are necessary for an appropriate expression of the ALAS gene. Insulin overrides the HNF3beta or HNF3beta plus NF1-mediated stimulation of ALAS transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and Southwestern blotting indicate that HNF3 binds to the ALAS promoter. Mutational analysis of this region revealed that IRE disruption abrogates insulin action, whereas mutation of the HNF3 element maintains hormone responsiveness. This dissociation between HNF3 binding and insulin action suggests that HNF3beta is not the sole physiologic mediator of insulin-induced transcriptional repression. Furthermore, Southwestern blotting assay shows that at least two polypeptides other than HNF3beta can bind to ALAS promoter and that this binding is dependent on the integrity of the IRE. We propose a model in which insulin exerts its negative effect through the disturbance of HNF3beta binding or transactivation potential, probably due to specific phosphorylation of this transcription factor by Akt. In this regard, results obtained from transfection experiments using kinase inhibitors support this hypothesis. Due to this event, NF1 would lose accessibility to the promoter. The posttranslational modification of HNF3 would allow the binding of a protein complex that recognizes the core IRE. These results provide a potential mechanism for the insulin-mediated repression of IRE-containing promoters.((PMID:10559496))During organogenesis, the winged helix hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta (HNF-3beta) protein participates in regulating gene transcription in the developing esophagus, trachea, liver, lung, pancreas, and intestine. Hepatoma cell transfection studies identified a critical HNF-3beta promoter factor, named UF2-H3beta, and here, we demonstrate that UF2-H3beta is identical to the fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF). In situ hybridization studies of mouse embryos demonstrate that FTF expression initiates in the foregut endoderm during liver and pancreatic morphogenesis (day 9) and that earlier expression of FTF is observed in the yolk sac endoderm, branchial arch and neural crest cells (day 8). Abundant FTF hybridization signals are observed throughout morphogenesis of the liver, pancreas, and intestine and its expression continues in the epithelial cells of these adult organs. In day 17 mouse embryos and adult pancreas, however, expression of FTF becomes restricted to the exocrine acinar and ductal epithelial cells.((PMID:26909576))Integrated genomic analysis of 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas identified 32 recurrently mutated genes that aggregate into 10 pathways: KRAS, TGF-β, WNT, NOTCH, ROBO/SLIT signalling, G1/S transition, SWI-SNF, chromatin modification, DNA repair and RNA processing. Expression analysis defined 4 subtypes: (1) squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and (4) aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX) that correlate with histopathological characteristics. Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations, upregulation of the TP63∆N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis. Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2). Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways involved in acquired immune suppression. These data infer differences in the molecular evolution of pancreatic cancer subtypes and identify opportunities for therapeutic development.((PMID:25063451))The orphan nuclear receptor NR5A2 is necessary for the stem-like properties of the epiblast of the pre-gastrulation embryo and for cellular and physiological homeostasis of endoderm-derived organs postnatally. Using conditional gene inactivation, we show that Nr5a2 also plays crucial regulatory roles during organogenesis. During the formation of the pancreas, Nr5a2 is necessary for the expansion of the nascent pancreatic epithelium, for the subsequent formation of the multipotent progenitor cell (MPC) population that gives rise to pre-acinar cells and bipotent cells with ductal and islet endocrine potential, and for the formation and differentiation of acinar cells. At birth, the NR5A2-deficient pancreas has defects in all three epithelial tissues: a partial loss of endocrine cells, a disrupted ductal tree and a >90% deficit of acini. The acinar defects are due to a combination of fewer MPCs, deficient allocation of those MPCs to pre-acinar fate, disruption of acinar morphogenesis and incomplete acinar cell differentiation. NR5A2 controls these developmental processes directly as well as through regulatory interactions with other pancreatic transcriptional regulators, including PTF1A, MYC, GATA4, FOXA2, RBPJL and MIST1 (BHLHA15). In particular, Nr5a2 and Ptf1a establish mutually reinforcing regulatory interactions and collaborate to control developmentally regulated pancreatic genes by binding to shared transcriptional regulatory regions. At the final stage of acinar cell development, the absence of NR5A2 affects the expression of Ptf1a and its acinar specific partner Rbpjl, so that the few acinar cells that form do not complete differentiation. Nr5a2 controls several temporally distinct stages of pancreatic development that involve regulatory mechanisms relevant to pancreatic oncogenesis and the maintenance of the exocrine phenotype.((PMID:25437555))Aging is accompanied by physiological impairments, which, in insulin-responsive tissues, including the liver, predispose individuals to metabolic disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze genome-wide profiles of RNA and chromatin organization in the liver of young (3 months) and old (21 months) mice. Transcriptional changes suggest that derepression of the nuclear receptors PPARα, PPARγ, and LXRα in aged mouse liver leads to activation of targets regulating lipid synthesis and storage, whereas age-dependent changes in nucleosome occupancy are associated with binding sites for both known regulators (forkhead factors and nuclear receptors) and candidates associated with nuclear lamina (Hdac3 and Srf) implicated to govern metabolic function of aging liver. Winged-helix transcription factor Foxa2 and nuclear receptor corepressor Hdac3 exhibit a reciprocal binding pattern at PPARα targets contributing to gene expression changes that lead to steatosis in aged liver.((PMID:23372643))It has been reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ and their synthetic ligands have direct effects on pancreatic β-cells. We investigated whether PPAR-γ activation stimulates insulin secretion through the up-regulation of GPR40 in pancreatic β-cells.Rat insulinoma INS-1 cells and primary rat islets were treated with rosiglitazone (RGZ) and/or adenoviral PPAR-γ overexpression. OLETF rats were treated with RGZ.PPAR-γ activation with RGZ and/or adenoviral PPAR-γ overexpression increased free fatty acid (FFA) receptor GPR40 expression, and increased insulin secretion and intracellular calcium mobilization, and was blocked by the PLC inhibitors, GPR40 RNA interference, and GLUT2 RNA interference. As a downstream signaling pathway of intracellular calcium mobilization, the phosphorylated levels of CaMKII and CREB, and the downstream IRS-2 and phospho-Akt were significantly increased. Despite of insulin receptor RNA interference, the levels of IRS-2 and phospho-Akt was still maintained with PPAR-γ activation. In addition, the β-cell specific gene expression, including Pdx-1 and FoxA2, increased in a GPR40- and GLUT2-dependent manner. The levels of GPR40, phosphorylated CaMKII and CREB, and β-cell specific genes induced by RGZ were blocked by GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist. Finally, PPAR-γ activation up-regulated β-cell gene expressions through FoxO1 nuclear exclusion, independent of the insulin signaling pathway. Based on immunohistochemical staining, the GLUT2, IRS-2, Pdx-1, and GPR40 were more strongly expressed in islets from RGZ-treated OLETF rats compared to control islets.These observations suggest that PPAR-γ activation with RGZ and/or adenoviral overexpression increased intracellular calcium mobilization, insulin secretion, and β-cell gene expression through GPR40 and GLUT2 gene up-regulation.((PMID:21292830))The winged helix protein FOXA2 and the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) are highly conserved, regionally expressed transcription factors (TFs) that regulate networks of genes controlling complex metabolic functions. Cistrome analysis for Foxa2 in mouse liver and PPARγ in mouse adipocytes has previously produced consensus-binding sites that are nearly identical to those used by the corresponding TFs in human cells. We report here that, despite the conservation of the canonical binding motif, the great majority of binding regions for FOXA2 in human liver and for PPARγ in human adipocytes are not in the orthologous locations corresponding to the mouse genome, and vice versa. Of note, TF binding can be absent in one species despite sequence conservation, including motifs that do support binding in the other species, demonstrating a major limitation of in silico binding site prediction. Whereas only approximately 10% of binding sites are conserved, gene-centric analysis reveals that about 50% of genes with nearby TF occupancy are shared across species for both hepatic FOXA2 and adipocyte PPARγ. Remarkably, for both TFs, many of the shared genes function in tissue-specific metabolic pathways, whereas species-unique genes fail to show enrichment for these pathways. Nonetheless, the species-unique genes, like the shared genes, showed the expected transcriptional regulation by the TFs in loss-of-function experiments. Thus, species-specific strategies underlie the biological functions of metabolic TFs that are highly conserved across mammalian species. Analysis of factor binding in multiple species may be necessary to distinguish apparent species-unique noise and reveal functionally relevant information.((PMID:19683054))Regular use of beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists may enhance non-specific airway responsiveness and inflammation. In earlier experimental studies, we showed that prolonged in vitro fenoterol exposure induced airway sensitization via perturbed epithelial regulation of bronchoconstriction. The aim of the present work was to examine the involvement of inflammatory mediator genes and proinflammatory cells and to investigate the role of the bronchial epithelium in these untoward effects. Bronchial tissues were surgically removed from 17 ex-smokers. Bronchial rings and primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells were incubated with 0.1microM fenoterol for 15h. Levels of mRNA-expression were analyzed using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction array. Bronchial rings were contracted with endothelin-1 and immune cell infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Compared to paired controls, fenoterol up-regulated the mRNAs of cytokines/proteins implicated in the recruitment of T and B cells or the activation and proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells (CCL20/MIP-3alpha, FOXA2, PPAR-gamma) in isolated bronchi and in cultured epithelial cells. Fenoterol exposure significantly enhanced CD8(+)-T and differentiated CD138(+)-B-cells infiltration into the bronchi, especially the subepithelial area. Increase in CD8 or CD138 labeling-intensity strongly correlated with rise in maximal contraction to endothelin-1 induced by fenoterol exposure. In summary, our results show that fenoterol modulates the T and B cells chemotaxis possibly via the epithelial chemokine secretion in isolated bronchi from ex-smokers. They also suggest that the infiltration of resident T and B cells into the subepithelial area is associated with an increase in airway responsiveness due to fenoterol exposure.((PMID:19082571))Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1 (PGC-1) alpha and -beta play pivotal roles in the regulation of intermediary metabolism. We have previously shown that PGC-1alpha-mediated upregulation of beta-cell sterol element binding protein (SREBP) gene expression impairs insulin secretion via increased transcription of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). PGC-1beta, in contrast to PGC-1alpha, directly binds to and acts as a co-activator of SREBPs and the forkhead transcription factor 2A (FOXA2) involved in pancreas development and function. To address a possible role of PGC-1beta in beta-cell function, we determined islet gene expression levels of PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta, SREBPs, FOXA2, FOXO1, UCP2 as well as granuphilin, a critical component of the insulin secretory machinery, in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF). In comparison to controls, mRNA levels of all genes studied except for FOXA2 and FOXO1 were increased in islets of obese, fa/fa ZDF rats. The transcriptional activities of the UCP2 and granuphilin promoters were assessed in INS-1E cells in response to PGC-1beta overexpression and small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing. PGC-1beta as well as SREBP-1c and -2 increased transcription from the UCP2 promoter in INS-1E cells. Transient transfection of PGC-1beta-specific siRNAs significantly decreased SREBP-2-mediated transcriptional activation of the UCP2 gene. Furthermore PGC-1beta, SREBP-1c, and FOXA2 overexpression augmented granuphilin promoter activity, whereas siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of PGC-1beta reduced the effects of SREBP-1c and FOXA2 on granuphilin gene transcription and significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin release from INS-1E cells. Our results support a role of PGC-1beta in the regulation of insulin secretion via upregulation of UCP2 and granuphilin gene expression.((PMID:17449907))Glucose disposal induces a signal that modulates the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the glycolysis and lipogenesis pathways. To investigate the role of glucose metabolism on hepatic gene expression independently from insulin action, we overexpressed glucokinase, the limiting enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, in the liver of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats. By microarray analysis, we observed that critical genes such as liver-type pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 were enhanced multiple-fold, whereas genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and the Krebs cycle were downregulated. Despite the increase in expression of fatty acid synthesis genes and the presence of steatosis, no major alterations to the levels of genes involved in VLDL assembly and secretion, such as diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, were observed. Overall, our data suggest that the gene expression pattern induced by glucose metabolism favors fatty acid storage in the liver rather than secretion into the circulation.((PMID:16489446))Rosiglitazone and metformin are two oral antihyperglycaemic drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. While both drugs have been shown to improve insulin-sensitive glucose uptake, the direct effects of these drugs on pancreatic beta cells is only now beginning to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to determine the direct effects of these agents on beta cell gene expression.We used reporter gene analysis to examine the effects of rosiglitazone and metformin on the activity of the proinsulin and insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF1) gene promoters in the glucose-responsive mouse beta cell line Min6. Western blot and gel retardation analyses were used to examine the effects of both drugs on the regulation of IPF1 protein production, nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity in both Min6 cells and isolated rat islets of Langerhans.Over 24 h, rosiglitazone promoted the nuclear accumulation of IPF1 and forkhead homeobox A2 (FOXA2), independently of glucose concentration, and stimulated a two-fold increase in the activity of the Ipf1 gene promoter (p<0.01). Stimulation of the Ipf1 promoter by rosiglitazone was unaffected by the presence of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma antagonist GW9662. No effect of either rosiglitazone or metformin was observed on proinsulin promoter activity. Metformin stimulated IPF1 nuclear accumulation and DNA binding activity in a time-dependent manner, with maximal effects observed after 2 h.Metformin and rosiglitazone have direct effects on beta cell gene expression, suggesting that these agents may play a previously unrecognised role in the direct regulation of pancreatic beta cell function.((PMID:19424602))WNT5A is a cancer-associated gene involved in invasion and metastasis of melanoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. WNT5A transduces signals through Frizzled, ROR1, ROR2 or RYK receptors to beta-catenin-TCF/LEF, DVL-RhoA-ROCK, DVL-RhoB-Rab4, DVL-Rac-JNK, DVL-aPKC, Calcineurin-NFAT, MAP3K7-NLK, MAP3K7-NF-kappaB, and DAG-PKC signaling cascades in a context-dependent manner. SNAI1 (Snail), CD44, G3BP2, and YAP1 are WNT5A target genes. We and other groups previously reported that IL6- or LIF-induced signaling through JAK-STAT3 signaling cascade is involved in WNT5A upregulation (STAT3-WNT5A signaling loop). Here, refined integrative genomic analyses of WNT5A were carried out to elucidate other mechanisms of WNT5A transcription. The WNT5A gene was found to encode two isoforms by using alternative first exons 1A and 1B. Quadruple Smad-binding elements (SBEs), single Sp1-binding site (GC-box), PPARgamma-binding site, C/EBP-binding site and bHLH-binding site within the promoter A region, 5'-adjacent to exon 1A, were conserved in human WNT5A, chimpanzee WNT5A, mouse Wnt5a, and rat Wnt5a. NF-kappaB-binding site, CUX1-binding site, double SBEs and double GC-boxes within the promoter B region, 5'-adjacent to exon 1B, were conserved in mammalian WNT5A orthologs. Quadruple FOX-binding sites and double SBEs within ultra-conserved intron 1 were also conserved in mammalian WNT5A orthologs. Conserved NF-kappaB-binding site within the WNT5A promoter B region elucidated the mechanisms that TNFalpha and toll-like receptor (TLR) signals upregulate WNT5A via MAP3K7. Quadruple FOX-binding sites rather than GLI-binding site revealed that Hedgehog signals induce WNT5A upregulation indirectly via FOX family members, such as FOXA2, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXF1 and FOXL1. TGFbeta signals were found to upregulate WNT5A expression directly through the Smad complex, and also indirectly through Smad-induced CUX1 and MAP3K7-mediated NF-kappaB. Together these facts indicate that WNT5A is transcribed based on multiple mechanisms, such as NF-kappaB, Hedgehog, TGFbeta, and Notch signaling cascades.((PMID:19715743))Enterocytes of the jejunum express several genes related to digestion/absorption of nutrients and ions when these cells rapidly differentiate from crypt to villus cells. However, it is unknown whether the distribution of extensive gene expression along the villus-crypt axis of the jejunum is altered during differentiation.We investigated the changes in jejunal gene expression during differentiation from crypt to villus cells in rats using DNA microarray analysis on cryostat sections of the villus-crypt columns.During differentiation, the expression of many genes related to cell growth rapidly decreased, while expression of genes related to digestion and absorption of nutrients and ions increased. Expression of a subset of genes related to the digestion and absorption of starch and sucrose was highest at the middle of the villi, whereas expression of genes related to dietary fat absorption was highest at the top of the villi. Several transcriptional factors such as Pdx1, Foxa2 and Thra were expressed in the crypt, whereas Klf15 was highly expressed during the crypt-villus transition. Expression of Klf4 and Pparg was highest at the top of the villi.Subsets of genes related to the digestion and absorption of starch/sucrose and dietary fat as well as their transcriptional factors/co-factors are expressed in the specific locations along the crypt-villus axis.The jejunum may absorb nutrients effectively by simultaneously expressing subsets of genes along the villus-crypt axis.((PMID:26916619))Recent high-throughput studies revealed recurrent RUNX1 mutations in breast cancer, specifically in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) tumours. However, mechanisms underlying the implied RUNX1-mediated tumour suppression remain elusive. Here, by depleting mammary epithelial cells of RUNX1 in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate combinatorial regulation of AXIN1 by RUNX1 and oestrogen. RUNX1 and ER occupy adjacent elements in AXIN1's second intron, and RUNX1 antagonizes oestrogen-mediated AXIN1 suppression. Accordingly, RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate an ER-dependent correlation between RUNX1 and AXIN1 in tumour biopsies. RUNX1 loss in ER(+) mammary epithelial cells increases β-catenin, deregulates mitosis and stimulates cell proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. However, it does not stimulate LEF/TCF, c-Myc or CCND1, and it does not accelerate G1/S cell cycle phase transition. Finally, RUNX1 loss-mediated deregulation of β-catenin and mitosis is ameliorated by AXIN1 stabilization in vitro, highlighting AXIN1 as a potential target for the management of ER(+) breast cancer.((PMID:26706127))AML1-ETO is the most common fusion oncoprotein causing acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 24%. AML1-ETO functions as a rogue transcription factor, altering the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation. Currently, there are no specific therapies for AML1-ETO-positive AML. While known for decades to be the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22), it is not known how AML1-ETO achieves its native and functional conformation or whether this process can be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Here, we show that the biosynthesis and folding of the AML1-ETO protein is facilitated by interaction with the essential eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT). We demonstrate that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO binds to TRiC directly, mainly through its β-strand rich, DNA-binding domain (AML-(1-175)), with the assistance of HSP70. Our results suggest that TRiC contributes to AML1-ETO proteostasis through specific interactions between the oncoprotein's DNA-binding domain, which may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.((PMID:26674644))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1-Evi-1 is a chimeric gene generated by the t (3; 21) (q26; q22) translocation, which leads into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by unclear mechanisms. This in vivo study aimed to establish a stable line of zebrafish expressing the human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene under the control of a heat stress-inducible bidirectional promoter, and investigate its roles in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies.We introduced human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter to establish Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. Two males and one female mosaic F0 zebrafish embryos (2.1%) were identified as stable positive germline transgenic zebrafish.The population of immature myeloid cells and hematopoietic blast cells were accumulated in peripheral blood and single cell suspension from kidney of adult Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. RUNX1-Evi-1 presented an intensive influence on hematopoietic regulatory factors. Consequently, primitive hematopoiesis was enhanced by upregulation of gata2 and scl, while erythropoiesis was downregulated due to the suppression of gata1. Early stage of myelopoiesis was flourishing with the high expression of pu.1, but it was inhibited along with the low expression of mpo. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RUNX1-Evi-1 not only upregulated proteasome, cell cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tyrosine metabolism, drug metabolism, and PPAR pathway, but also suppressed transforming growth factor β, Jak-STAT, DNA replication, mismatch repair, p53 pathway, JNK signaling pathway, and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 4 was significantly up-regulated. Factors in cell proliferation were obviously suppressed after 3-day treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid. Accordingly, higher proportion of G1 arrest and apoptosis were manifested by the propidium iodide staining.RUNX1-Evi-1 may promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance of primitive hematopoietic cell, and inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells with the synergy of different pathways and factors. VPA may be a promising choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-Evi-1-related leukemia.((PMID:26580584))Two distantly located promoter regions regulate the dynamic expression of RUNX genes during development: distal P1 and proximal P2 promoters. We have recently described that β-catenin increases total Runx1 mRNA levels in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors and enhances spatial proximity with its translocation partner ETO. Here, we report that induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HL60 and Jurkat leukemia-derived cell lines and CD34(+) progenitors selectively activate the production of the longer distal P1-Runx1 mRNA isoform. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that the differential increase in P1-Runx1 expression is accomplished through a minimal β-catenin responsive region that includes a highly conserved TCF/LEF-binding element, located -20/-16 bp upstream of the canonical distal P1-Runx1 transcription start site. We conclude that the distal P1-Runx1 promoter is a direct transcriptional target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that may be important in normal hematopoiesis or its transition into malignant stem cells during the onset or progression of leukemia.((PMID:26418744))The generation of diverse neuronal subtypes involves specification of neural progenitors and, subsequently, postmitotic neuronal differentiation, a relatively poorly understood process. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of Cbfb but not Runx1 prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of Runx1 in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for Cbfb expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification.((PMID:26397705))The t(8;21) and Inv(16) translocations disrupt the normal function of core binding factors alpha (CBFA) and beta (CBFB), respectively. These translocations represent two of the most common genomic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, occurring in approximately 25% pediatric and 15% of adult with this malignancy. Both translocations are associated with favorable clinical outcomes after intensive chemotherapy, and given the perceived mechanistic similarities, patients with these translocations are frequently referred to as having CBF-AML. It remains uncertain as to whether, collectively, these translocations are mechanistically the same or impact different pathways in subtle ways that have both biological and clinical significance. Therefore, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the similarities and differences in genes and pathways between these subtypes of pediatric AMLs. Diagnostic RNA from patients with t(8;21) (N = 17), Inv(16) (N = 14), and normal karyotype (NK, N = 33) were subjected to RNA-seq. Analyses compared the transcriptomes across these three cytogenetic subtypes, using the NK cohort as the control. A total of 1291 genes in t(8;21) and 474 genes in Inv(16) were differentially expressed relative to the NK controls, with 198 genes differentially expressed in both subtypes. The majority of these genes (175/198; binomial test p-value < 10(-30)) are consistent in expression changes among the two subtypes suggesting the expression profiles are more similar between the CBF cohorts than in the NK cohort. Our analysis also revealed alternative splicing events (ASEs) differentially expressed across subtypes, with 337 t(8;21)-specific and 407 Inv(16)-specific ASEs detected, the majority of which were acetylated proteins (p = 1.5 x 10(-51) and p = 1.8 x 10(-54) for the two subsets). In addition to known fusions, we identified and verified 16 de novo fusions in 43 patients, including three fusions involving NUP98 in six patients. Clustering of differentially expressed genes indicated that the homeobox (HOX) gene family, including two transcription factors (MEIS1 and NKX2-3) were down-regulated in CBF compared to NK samples. This finding supports existing data that the dysregulation of HOX genes play a central role in biology CBF-AML hematopoiesis. These data provide comprehensive transcriptome profiling of CBF-AML and delineate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed, providing insights into the shared biology as well as differences in the two CBF subsets.((PMID:26333776))Chromosomal translocations are frequently associated with a wide variety of cancers, particularly hematologic malignancies. A recurrent chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia is the reciprocal translocation t(8;21) that fuses RUNX1 and ETO genes. We report here that Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases the expression of ETO and RUNX1 genes in human hematopoietic progenitors. We found that β-catenin is rapidly recruited into RNA polymerase II transcription factories (RNAPII-Ser5) and that ETO and RUNX1 genes are brought into close spatial proximity upon Wnt3a induction. Notably, long-term treatment of cells with Wnt3a induces the generation a frequent RUNX1-ETO translocation event. Thus, Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces transcription and translocation of RUNX1 and ETO fusion gene partners, opening a novel window to understand the onset/development of leukemia.((PMID:26254341))Th-inducing Pox virus and zinc finger/Krüppel-like factor (ThPOK) is a key commitment factor for CD4(+) lineage T cells and is essential for the maintenance of CD4 lineage integrity; thus, the expression of ThPOK has to be tightly controlled. In this article, we demonstrate that Myc-associated zinc finger-related factor (MAZR) and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) together repressed ThPOK in preselection double-positive thymocytes, whereas MAZR acted in synergy with Runx3 in the repression of ThPOK in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, MAZR-Runx1 and MAZR-Runx3 double-mutant mice showed enhanced derepression of Cd4 in double-negative thymocytes and in CD8(+) T cells in comparison with Runx1 or Runx3 single-deficient mice, respectively, indicating that MAZR modulates Cd4 silencing. Thus, our data demonstrate developmental stage-specific synergistic activities between MAZR and Runx/core-binding factor β (CBFβ) complexes. Finally, retroviral Cre-mediated conditional deletion of MAZR in peripheral CD8(+) T cells led to the derepression of ThPOK, thus showing that MAZR is also part of the molecular machinery that maintains a repressed state of ThPOK in CD8(+) T cells.((PMID:26091714))Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in tumor-associated immunosuppression, thus affecting effective immunotherapies for cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the differentiation and function of MDSCs remain largely unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of microRNA (miR)-9 promoted the differentiation of MDSCs with significantly reduced immunosuppressive function whereas overexpression of miR-9 markedly enhanced the function of MDSCs. Notably, knockdown of miR-9 significantly impaired the activity of MDSCs and inhibited the tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. Moreover, miR-9 regulated MDSCs differentiation by targeting the runt-related transcription factor 1, an essential transcription factor in regulating MDSC differentiation and function. Furthermore, the CREB was found to regulate miR-9 expression in MDSCs. Taken together, our findings have identified a critical role of miR-9 in regulating the differentiation and function of MDSCs.((PMID:26019273))Proper regulation of microbial-induced cytokines is critical to intestinal immune homeostasis. Acute stimulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), the Crohn's disease-associated sensor of bacterial peptidoglycan, induces cytokines. However, chronic NOD2 stimulation in macrophages decreases cytokines upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) restimulation; cytokine attenuation to PRR stimulation is similarly observed in intestinal macrophages. The role for the transcriptional repressors Twist1 and Twist2 in regulating PRR-induced cytokine outcomes is poorly understood and has not been reported for NOD2. We found that Twist1 and Twist2 were required for optimal cytokine downregulation during acute and, particularly, chronic NOD2 stimulation of human macrophages. Consistently, Twist1 and Twist2 expression was increased after chronic NOD2 stimulation; this increased expression was IL-10 and TGF-β dependent. Although Twist1 and Twist2 did not coregulate each other's expression, they cooperated to enhance binding to cytokine promoters after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Moreover, Twist1 and Twist2 contributed to enhance expression and promoter binding of the proinflammatory inhibitor c-Maf and the transcriptional repressor Bmi1. Restoring c-Maf and Bmi1 expression in Twist-deficient macrophages restored NOD2-induced cytokine downregulation. Furthermore, with chronic NOD2 stimulation, Twist1 and Twist2 contributed to the decreased expression and cytokine promoter binding of the transcriptional activators activating transcription factor 4, C/EBPα, Runx1, and Runx2. Knockdown of these transcriptional activators in Twist-deficient macrophages restored cytokine downregulation after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Finally, NOD2 synergized with additional PRRs to increase Twist1 and Twist2 expression and Twist-dependent pathways. Therefore, after chronic NOD2 stimulation Twist1 and Twist2 coordinate the regulation of both transcriptional activators and repressors, thereby mediating optimal cytokine downregulation.((PMID:26001080))Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is a group of secondary and organized lymphoid tissue that develops at different mucosal surfaces. Peyer's patches (PPs), nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and tear duct-associated lymphoid tissue (TALT) are representative MALT in the small intestine, nasal cavity, and lacrimal sac, respectively. A recent study has shown that transcriptional regulators of core binding factor (Cbf) β2 and promotor-1-transcribed Runt-related transcription factor 1 (P1-Runx1) are required for the differentiation of CD3-CD4+CD45+ lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, which initiate and trigger the developmental program of PPs, but the involvement of this pathway in NALT and TALT development remains to be elucidated. Here we report that Cbfβ2 plays an essential role in NALT and TALT development by regulating LTi cell trafficking to the NALT and TALT anlagens. Cbfβ2 was expressed in LTi cells in all three types of MALT examined. Indeed, similar to the previous finding for PPs, we found that Cbfβ2-/- mice lacked NALT and TALT lymphoid structures. However, in contrast to PPs, NALT and TALT developed normally in the absence of P1-Runx1 or other Runx family members such as Runx2 and Runx3. LTi cells for NALT and TALT differentiated normally but did not accumulate in the respective lymphoid tissue anlagens in Cbfβ2-/- mice. These findings demonstrate that Cbfβ2 is a central regulator of the MALT developmental program, but the dependency of Runx proteins on the lymphoid tissue development would differ among PPs, NALT, and TALT.((PMID:25994056))Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation can be used to identify transcriptional enhancers, but no systematic approach has been developed for genome-wide identification and analysis of enhancers based on DNA methylation. We describe ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), an R-based tool that uses DNA methylation to identify enhancers and correlates enhancer state with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional targets. Transcription factor motif analysis of enhancers is coupled with expression analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators. Using ELMER, we investigated more than 2,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identified networks regulated by known cancer drivers such as GATA3 and FOXA1 (breast cancer), SOX17 and FOXA2 (endometrial cancer), and NFE2L2, SOX2, and TP63 (squamous cell lung cancer). We also identified novel networks with prognostic associations, including RUNX1 in kidney cancer. We propose ELMER as a powerful new paradigm for understanding the cis-regulatory interface between cancer-associated transcription factors and their functional target genes.((PMID:25893288))The t(12;21) translocation is the most common genetic rearrangement in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and gives rise to the TEL-AML1 fusion gene. Many studies on TEL-AML1 describe specific properties of the fusion protein, but a thorough understanding of its function is lacking. We exploited a pluripotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line, EML1, and generated a cell line (EML-TA) stably expressing the TEL-AML1 fusion protein. EML1 cells differentiate to mature B-cells following treatment with IL7; whereas EML-TA display an impaired differentiation capacity and remain blocked at an early stage of maturation. Global gene expression profiling of EML1 cells at different stages of B-lymphoid differentiation, compared with EML-TA, identified the interferon (IFN)α/β pathway as a primary target of repression by TEL-AML1. In particular, expression and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was decreased in EML-TA cells; strikingly, stable expression of IRF3 restored the capacity of EML-TA cells to differentiate into mature B-cells. Similarly, IRF3 silencing in EML1 cells by siRNA was sufficient to block B-lymphoid differentiation. The ability of TEL-AML1 to block B-cell differentiation and downregulate the IRF3-IFNα/β pathway was confirmed in mouse and human primary hematopoietic precursor cells (Lin- and CD34+ cells, respectively), and in a patient-derived cell line expressing TEL-AML1 (REH). Furthermore, treatment of TEL-AML1 expressing cells with IFNα/β was sufficient to overcome the maturation block. Our data provide new insight on TEL-AML1 function and may offer a new therapeutic opportunity for B-ALL.((PMID:25840971))Transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for normal hematopoiesis. High mutation frequencies of RUNX1 gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been described, whereas the biologic significances of the mutations were not investigated. Here, we aimed to correlate the biologic activities of the RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes of patients.We examined the mutational status of RUNX1 in 143 MDS and 84 CMML patients. Then, we studied the DNA and CBFβ binding abilities of all the RUNX1 mutants identified by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, and also determined their activities on target C-FMS gene induction by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Using luciferase reporter assay, the relative biologic activities of each RUNX1 mutant could be quantified and correlated with the patient outcomes by statistical analyses.We observed that most RUNX1 mutants had reduced abilities in DNA binding, CBFβ heterodimerization, and C-FMS gene induction. The relative biologic activities of RUNX1 mutants were grouped into high- and low-activity mutations. Correlation of the activities of RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes revealed that patients harboring lower activities of RUNX1 mutants had a higher risk and shorter time to secondary acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS and CMML. In multivariate analysis, low RUNX1 activity remained an independent predictor for secondary acute myeloid leukemia-free survival in MDS patients.The biologic activity rather than the mutational status of RUNX1 might be an indicator in predicting outcome of patients with MDS and CMML.((PMID:25742748))CBFβ-SMMHC (core-binding factor β-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain), the fusion protein generated by the chromosome 16 inversion fusion gene, CBFB-MYH11, is known to initiate leukemogenesis. However, the mechanism through which CBFβ-SMMHC contributes to leukemia development is not well understood. Previously, it was proposed that CBFβ-SMMHC acts by dominantly repressing the transcription factor RUNX1 (Runt-related protein 1), but we recently showed that CBFβ-SMMHC has activities that are independent of RUNX1 repression. In addition, we showed that a modified CBFβ-SMMHC with decreased RUNX1-binding activity accelerates leukemogenesis. These results raise questions about the importance of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis by CBFβ-SMMHC. To test this, we generated mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 in a Runx1-deficient background, resulting from either homozygous Runx1-null alleles (Runx1(-/-)) or a single dominant-negative Runx1 allele (Runx1(+/lz)). We found that loss of Runx1 activity rescued the differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11 during primitive hematopoiesis. During definitive hematopoiesis, RUNX1 loss also significantly reduced the proliferation and differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11. Importantly, Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemia had much longer latency in Runx1(+/lz) mice than in Runx1-sufficient mice. These data indicate that Runx1 activity is critical for Cbfb-MYH11-induced hematopoietic defects and leukemogenesis.((PMID:25678665))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of adult leukemia. The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16)(p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML. Current inv(16) AML treatment with nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a good initial response but limited long-term survival. Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFβ-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1. AI-10-49 restores RUNX1 transcriptional activity, displays favorable pharmacokinetics, and delays leukemia progression in mice. Treatment of primary inv(16) AML patient blasts with AI-10-49 triggers selective cell death. These data suggest that direct inhibition of the oncogenic CBFβ-SMMHC fusion protein may be an effective therapeutic approach for inv(16) AML, and they provide support for transcription factor targeted therapy in other cancers.((PMID:25605286))Differentiated CD4(+) T cells preserve plasticity under various conditions. However, the stability of Th1 cells is unclear, as is whether Th1 cells can convert into Th17 cells and thereby contribute to the generation of IFN-γ(+) IL-17(+) CD4(+) T cells, the number of which correlates with severity of colitis. We investigated whether IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells can convert into Th17 cells under intestinal inflammation and the mechanisms involved. IFN-γ(Thy1.1+) Th1 cells were generated by culturing naïve CD4(+) T cells from IFN-γ(Thy1.1) CBir1 TCR-Tg reporter mice, whose TCR is specific for an immunodominant microbiota antigen, CBir1 flagellin, under Th1 polarizing conditions. IFN-γ(Thy1.1+) Th1 cells induced colitis in Rag(-/-) mice after adoptive transfer and converted into IL-17(+) Th17, but not Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the inflamed intestines. TGF-β and IL-6, but not IL-1β and IL-23, regulated Th1 conversion into Th17 cells. TGF-β induction of transcriptional factor Runx1 is crucial for the conversion, since silencing Runx1 by siRNA inhibited Th1 conversion into Th17 cells. Furthermore, TGF-β enhanced histone H3K9 acetylation but inhibited H3K9 trimethylation of Runx1- and ROR-γt-binding sites on il-17 or rorc gene in Th1 cells. We conclude that Th1 cells convert into Th17 cells under inflammatory conditions in intestines, which is possibly mediated by TGF-β induction of Runx1.((PMID:25083921))Cooperative assemblies of transcription factors (TFs) on target gene enhancers coordinate cell proliferation, fate specification, and differentiation through precise and complicated transcriptional mechanisms. Chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, of TFs induced by cell signaling further modulate the dynamic cooperativity of TFs. In this study, we found that various Ets1-containing TF-DNA complexes respond differently to calcium-induced phosphorylation of Ets1, which is known to inhibit Ets1-DNA binding. Crystallographic analysis of a complex comprising Ets1, Runx1, and CBFβ at the TCRα enhancer revealed that Ets1 acquires robust binding stability in the Runx1 and DNA-complexed state, via allosteric mechanisms. This allows phosphorylated Ets1 to be retained at the TCRα enhancer with Runx1, in contrast to other Ets1 target gene enhancers including mb-1 and stromelysin-1. This study provides a structure-based model for cell-signaling-dependent regulation of target genes, mediated via chemical modification of TFs.((PMID:25025858))The aim of this research was to investigate the gene expression profile of 4 transcription factors in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) cultured with a xenogeneic bone substitute and a support of machined titanium.In vitro studies were performed on hMSC cells, which grew in contact with cortical porcine bone and machined titanium disks for 10 days. RNA quantification for genes DLX5, CTNNB1, RUNX1, and SP7 was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. For cells supported by titanium, immunocytochemistry of osteocalcin (OC) was also performed.In the osteoblast-induced cells (OIC), DLX5, CTNNB1, and RUNX1 were significantly upregulated (+2.38-, +3.51-, and +7.08-fold, respectively), whereas SP7 was downregulated (-26.32-fold). None of the genes seemed to be upregulated or downregulated by the corticocancellous porcine bone. In cells grown on titanium support, DLX5 and RUNX1 were respectively upregulated (+3.12-fold) and downregulated (-2.14-fold). For titanium support, the presence of both catenin beta-1 and OC was verified.The 2 genes RUNX1 and SP7 resulted differently expressed in cells cultured on metallic supports if compared with the expression recorded for OIC. An induction of the osteogenic phenotype was observed when cells were cultured on machined titanium, but not on xenogeneic material.((PMID:24798493))Core-binding factor β (Cbfβ) is a subunit of the Cbf family of heterodimeric transcription factors, which plays a critical role in skeletal development through its interaction with the Cbfα subunits, also known as Runt-related transcription factors (Runxs). However, the mechanism by which Cbfβ regulates cartilage and bone development remains unclear. Existing Cbfβ-deficient mouse models cannot specify the role of Cbfβ in skeletal cell lineage. Herein, we sought to specifically address the role of Cbfβ in cartilage and bone development by using a conditional knockout (CKO) approach. A mesenchymal-specific Cbfβ CKO mouse model was generated by using the Dermo1-Cre mouse line to specifically delete Cbfβ in mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Surprisingly, the mutant mice had under-developed larynx and tracheal cartilage, causing alveolus defects that led to death shortly after birth from suffocation. Also, the mutant mice exhibited severe skeletal deformities from defective intramembranous and endochondral ossification, owing to delayed chondrocyte maturation and impaired osteoblast differentiation. Almost all bones of the mutant mice, including the calvariae, vertebrae, tibiae, femurs, ribs, limbs and sternums were defective. Importantly, we showed that Cbfβ was expressed throughout the skeleton during both embryonic and postnatal development, which explains the multiple-skeletal defects observed in the mutant mice. Consistently, Cbfβ deficiency impaired both chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy zone hypertrophy during growth-plate development in the long bones of mutant mice. Notably, Cbfβ, Runx1 and Runx2 displayed different expression patterns in the growth plates of the wild-type mice, indicating that Cbfβ/Runx1 complex and Cbfβ/Runx2 complex may regulate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, respectively, in a spatial and temporal manner. Cbfβ deletion in the mesenchymal progenitors affected bone development by dramatically down-regulating Collagen X (Col X) and Osterix (Osx) but had a dispensable effect on osteoclast development. Collectively, the results demonstrate that Cbfβ mediates cartilage and bone development by interacting with Runx1 and Runx2 to regulate the expressions of Col X and Osx for chondrocyte and osteoblast development. These findings not only reveal a critical role for Cbfβ in cartilage and bone development but also facilitate the design of novel therapeutic approaches for skeletal diseases.((PMID:27176614))Core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor complex composed of a DNA-binding subunit, one of three runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) factors, and a non-DNA binding subunit, CBFβ. CBFβ is critical for DNA binding and stability of the CBF transcription factor complex. In the ovary, the LH surge increases the expression of Runx1 and Runx2 in periovulatory follicles, implicating a role for CBFs in the periovulatory process. The present study investigated the functional significance of CBFs (RUNX1/CBFβ and RUNX2/CBFβ) in the ovary by examining the ovarian phenotype of granulosa cell-specific CBFβ knockdown mice; CBFβ f/f * Cyp19 cre. The mutant female mice exhibited significant reductions in fertility, with smaller litter sizes, decreased progesterone during gestation, and fewer cumulus oocyte complexes collected after an induced superovulation. RNA sequencing and transcriptome assembly revealed altered expression of more than 200 mRNA transcripts in the granulosa cells of Cbfb knockdown mice after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation in vitro. Among the affected transcripts are known regulators of ovulation and luteinization including Sfrp4, Sgk1, Lhcgr, Prlr, Wnt4, and Edn2 as well as many genes not yet characterized in the ovary. Cbfβ knockdown mice also exhibited decreased expression of key genes within the corpora lutea and morphological changes in the ovarian structure, including the presence of large antral follicles well into the luteal phase. Overall, these data suggest a role for CBFs as significant regulators of gene expression, ovulatory processes, and luteal development in the ovary.((PMID:26058470))Core binding factor β (Cbfβ) is a partner protein of Runx family transcription factors with minimally characterized function in cartilage. Here we address the role of Cbfβ in cartilage by generating chondrocyte-specific Cbfβ-deficient mice (Cbfb(Δch/Δch) ) from Cbfb-floxed mice crossed with mice expressing Cre from the Col2a1 promoter. Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice died soon after birth and exhibited delayed endochondral bone formation, shorter appendicular skeleton length with increased proliferative chondrocytes, and nearly absent hypertrophic chondrocyte zones. Immunohistochemical and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the number and size of proliferative chondrocytes increased and the expression of chondrocyte maturation markers at the growth plates, including Runx2, osterix, and osteopontin, significantly diminished in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice compared to wild type mice. With regard to signaling pathways, both PTHrP-Ihh and BMP signaling were compromised in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice. Mechanistically, Cbfβ deficiency in chondrocytes caused a decrease of protein levels of Runx transcription factors by accelerating polyubiquitination-mediated proteosomal degradation in vitro. Indeed, Runx2 and Runx3, but not Runx1, decreased in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that Cbfβ plays a critical role for chondrocyte differentiation through stabilizing Runx2 and Runx3 proteins in cartilage.((PMID:25262822))Runx family proteins, Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3, play important roles in skeletal development. Runx2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, and haplodeficiency of RUNX2 causes cleidocranial dysplasia, which is characterized by open fontanelles and sutures and hypoplastic clavicles. Cbfb forms a heterodimer with Runx family proteins and enhances their DNA-binding capacity. Cbfb-deficient (Cbfb(-/-) ) mice die at midgestation because of the lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis. We previously reported that the partial rescue of hematopoiesis in Cbfb(-/-) mice revealed the requirement of Cbfb in skeletal development. However, the precise functions of Cbfb in skeletal development still remain to be clarified. We deleted Cbfb in mesenchymal cells giving rise to both chondrocyte and osteoblast lineages by mating Cbfb(fl/fl) mice with Dermo1 Cre knock-in mice. Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) mice showed dwarfism, both intramembranous and endochondral ossifications were retarded, and chondrocyte maturation and proliferation and osteoblast differentiation were inhibited. The differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts were severely inhibited in vitro, and the reporter activities of Ihh, Col10a1, and Bglap2 promoter constructs were reduced in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) chondrocytes or osteoblasts. The proteins of Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3 were reduced in the cartilaginous limb skeletons and calvariae of Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) embryos compared with the respective protein in the respective tissue of Cbfb(fl/fl) embryos at E15.5, although the reduction of Runx2 protein in calvariae was much milder than that in cartilaginous limb skeletons. All of the Runx family proteins were severely reduced in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) primary osteoblasts, and Runx2 protein was less stable in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) osteoblasts than Cbfb(fl/fl) osteoblasts. These findings indicate that Cbfb is required for skeletal development by regulating chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation and osteoblast differentiation; that Cbfb plays an important role in the stabilization of Runx family proteins; and that Runx2 protein stability is less dependent on Cbfb in calvariae than in cartilaginous limb skeletons.((PMID:24319172))The genetics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are becoming well understood and the incidence of individual chromosomal abnormalities varies considerably with age. Cytogenetics provide reliable risk stratification for treatment: high hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 are good risk, whereas BCR-ABL1, MLL rearrangements, and hypodiploidy are poor risk. Nevertheless, some patients within the good- and intermediate-risk groups will unpredictably relapse. With advancing technologies in array-based approaches (single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) and next-generation sequencing to study the genome, increasing numbers of new genetic changes are being discovered. These include deletions of B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes, as well as mutations of genes in key signaling pathways. Their associations and interactions with established cytogenetic subgroups and with each other are becoming elucidated. Whether they have a link to outcome is the most important factor for refinement of risk factors in relation to clinical trials. For several newly identified abnormalities, including intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21), that are associated with a poor prognosis with standard therapy, appropriately modified treatment has significantly improved outcome. After the successful use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with alternative ABL1 translocations and rearrangements involving PDGFRB may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Other aberrations, for example, CRLF2 overexpression and JAK2 mutations, are also providing potential novel therapeutic targets with the prospect of reduced toxicity.((PMID:23979164))RUNX1 is generally considered a tumor suppressor in myeloid neoplasms. Inactivating RUNX1 mutations have frequently been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no somatic RUNX1 alteration was found in AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia and MLL fusion leukemia, raising the possibility that RUNX1 could actually promote the growth of these leukemia cells. Using normal human cord blood cells and those expressing leukemogenic fusion proteins, we discovered a dual role of RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. RUNX1 overexpression inhibited the growth of normal cord blood cells by inducing myeloid differentiation, whereas a certain level of RUNX1 activity was required for the growth of AML1-ETO and MLL-AF9 cells. Using a mouse genetic model, we also showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited leukemia development induced by MLL-AF9. RUNX2 could compensate for the loss of RUNX1. The survival effect of RUNX1 was mediated by BCL2 in MLL fusion leukemia. Our study unveiled an unexpected prosurvival role for RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. Inhibiting RUNX1 activity rather than enhancing it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins.((PMID:23772668))The 8;21 translocation is the most common chromosomal aberration occurring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This translocation causes expression of the RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO) fusion protein, which cooperates with additional mutations in leukemia development. We report here that interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes are a group of genes consistently up-regulated by RUNX1-ETO in both human and murine models. RUNX1-ETO-induced up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes occurs primarily via type I IFN signaling with a requirement for the IFNAR complex. Addition of exogenous IFN in vitro significantly reduces the increase in self-renewal potential induced by both RUNX1-ETO and its leukemogenic splicing isoform RUNX1-ETO9a. Finally, loss of type I IFN signaling via knockout of Ifnar1 significantly accelerates leukemogenesis in a t(8;21) murine model. This demonstrates the role of increased IFN signaling as an important factor inhibiting t(8;21) fusion protein function and leukemia development and supports the use of type I IFNs in the treatment of AML.((PMID:23713453))Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) is a downstream effector of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and its dysregulation is associated with a number of malignant diseases such as leukemia. We explored the expression profile of LEF1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determined its specific prognostic significance in this disease. The LEF1 mRNA level in patients with previously untreated AML was significantly higher than in normal controls. Patients with AML with relatively higher LEF1 expression were more likely to achieve a complete remission (CR) following induction therapy in comparison to those with a lower LEF1 level. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that primary AML samples with AML1-ETO or PML-RARα have a higher LEF1 level compared with those without each fusion gene. High LEF1 expression predicts a significantly better overall survival for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. High LEF1 level was associated with a favorable relapse-free survival in patients with FLT3-ITD wild-type. Finally, a scoring system based on LEF1 level and mutation status of FLT3-ITD or NPM1 is reliable to predict the outcome for AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Our results indicate that LEF1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AML and could serve as a novel predictor of better treatment response. LEF1 level may be incorporated into an improved risk classification system for certain specific subtypes of AML.((PMID:23672350))No consecutive analysis of BAALC and WT1 expressions associated with core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML) from diagnosis to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has yet been reported. We investigated BAALC and WT1 expressions using a method of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) at diagnosis, after induction chemotherapy, at pre-HSCT, and at post-HSCT period in 45 consecutive patients [t(8,21) (n = 28), inv(16) (n = 17)], who received HSCT as a post-remission treatment. BAALC and WT1 RQ-PCR decrement ratio (DR) was also calculated at post-induction chemotherapy, at pre-HSCT, and at post-HSCT compared with the diagnostic level. Higher BAALC expression at diagnosis showed significantly inferior OS (P = 0.031), EFS (P = 0.011), and higher CIR (P = 0.002) rates. At post-HSCT, both higher BAALC and WT1 expressions showed significantly inferior OS (P = 0.005, 0.016), EFS (P = 0.002, 0.006), and higher CIR (P = 0.001, 0.003) rates. A subgroup of t(8;21) showing higher BAALC and WT1 expressions at post-HSCT were also associated with inferior OS (P = 0.018, 0.015) and higher CIR rates (P = 0.019, 0.011). While BAALC DR showed no significant results on outcomes, WT1 DR more than 2-log at post-HSCT showed significantly lower CIR rate (P = 0.028). This study showed that higher post-HSCT BAALC and WT1 expressions in patients with CBF-AML may be good markers of minimal residual disease for the prediction of survival and relapse after HSCT.((PMID:23645839))Developing novel therapies that suppress self-renewal of leukemia stem cells may reduce the likelihood of relapses and extend long-term survival of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML1-ETO (AE) is an oncogene that plays an important role in inducing self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), leading to the development of leukemia stem cells. Previously, using a zebrafish model of AE and a whole-organism chemical suppressor screen, we have discovered that AE induces specific hematopoietic phenotypes in embryonic zebrafish through a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and β-catenin-dependent pathway. Here, we show that AE also induces expression of the Cox-2 gene and activates β-catenin in mouse bone marrow cells. Inhibition of COX suppresses β-catenin activation and serial replating of AE(+) mouse HSPCs. Genetic knockdown of β-catenin also abrogates the clonogenic growth of AE(+) mouse HSPCs and human leukemia cells. In addition, treatment with nimesulide, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, dramatically suppresses xenograft tumor formation and inhibits in vivo progression of human leukemia cells. In summary, our data indicate an important role of a COX/β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway in tumor initiation, growth, and self-renewal, and in providing the rationale for testing potential benefits from common COX inhibitors as a part of AML treatments.((PMID:23179400))It is known that leukemia patients with extramedullary infiltration (EMI) have a worse prognosis than patients without it. Recent data indicate that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation. The expression of APP and its prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been studied. Our study shows that AML/ETO(+) leukemia patients that overexpress APP easily get EMI and that their long-term survival rate is lower than patients without overexpression of APP. In an in vitro study, we knocked down APP in Kasumi-1 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Transwell data show that siRNA/APP substantially impairs cell migration, but it does not inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, we found that siRNA/APP decreases MMP-2 expression in vitro. Our study provides a novel clue that APP is involved in the extramedullary infiltration of leukemia by MMP-2.((PMID:22031861))Secreted-frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) are modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway that is closely involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Epigenetic deregulation of Wnt modulators leading to aberrant signaling has been reported in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its occurrence in childhood patients with AML and the role of individual modulators are unclear. In this study, we examined SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, and SFRP5 promoter methylation in 83 patients with AML (59 children and 24 adults) and found preferential SFRP1 methylation and mRNA down-regulation in the prognostically favorable subgroup of AML with t(8;21) translocation. Among the 4 genes, SFRP1 methylation independently predicted prolonged event-free and relapse-free survivals in childhood patients with nonacute promyelocytic leukemia with nonadverse cytogenetics. Mechanistically, we further demonstrated that RUNX1-ETO, the t(8;21) fusion product, specifically bound the SFRP1 promoter and repressed its transcription via a consensus RUNX binding site. In t(8;21)-leukemia cells, SFRP1 selectively inhibited canonical Wnt signaling and cellular proliferation that were associated with concomitant down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, including CCND1 and MYC. Taken together, we identified SFRP1 as a transcriptional repression target of the t(8;21) fusion protein and demonstrated a novel mechanism of Wnt activation in a specific subtype of AML.((PMID:22012064))The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) H3K4 methyltransferase protein, and the heterodimeric RUNX1/CBFβ transcription factor complex, are critical for definitive and adult hematopoiesis, and both are frequently targeted in human acute leukemia. We identified a physical and functional interaction between RUNX1 (AML1) and MLL and show that both are required to maintain the histone lysine 4 trimethyl mark (H3K4me3) at 2 critical regulatory regions of the AML1 target gene PU.1. Similar to CBFβ, we show that MLL binds to AML1 abrogating its proteasome-dependent degradation. Furthermore, a subset of previously uncharacterized frame-shift and missense mutations at the N terminus of AML1, found in MDS and AML patients, impairs its interaction with MLL, resulting in loss of the H3K4me3 mark within PU.1 regulatory regions, and decreased PU.1 expression. The interaction between MLL and AML1 provides a mechanism for the sequence-specific binding of MLL to DNA, and identifies RUNX1 target genes as potential effectors of MLL function.((PMID:21051318))The genetic origins of the development of malignant haematological disorders have been established at the beginning of the 80ies. Systematic characterization of chromosomal structural abnormalities and, more recently by DNA microarray approaches and sequencing of tumour genomes have allowed the identification of a large number of genes that are mutated during malignant transformation in humans. Functional studies of these human oncogenes have shown that most of them were not able to transform a haematologic progenitor when acting alone and that cooperation with other oncogenic events was required. The present challenges are the evaluation of the role of each mutation in malignant transformation and the definition of the chronology of their emergence. From these data, the development of efficient therapeutic approaches will be possible by targeting the early oncogenic events which are at the origin of the malignant transformation.((PMID:20688956))Among mutations in human Runx1/AML1 transcription factors, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) genomic translocation that creates an AML1-ETO fusion protein is implicated in etiology of the acute myeloid leukemia. To identify genes and components associated with this oncogene we used Drosophila as a genetic model. Expression of AML1-ETO caused an expansion of hematopoietic precursors in Drosophila, which expressed high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mutations in functional domains of the fusion protein suppress the proliferative phenotype. In a genetic screen, we found that inactivation of EcRB1 or activation of Foxo and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) suppress the AML1-ETO-induced phenotype by reducing ROS expression in the precursor cells. Our studies indicate that ROS is a signaling factor promoting maintenance of normal as well as the aberrant myeloid precursors and suggests the importance of antioxidant enzymes and their regulators as targets for further study in the context of leukemia.((PMID:20395424))((PMID:20339092))The transcription factor NF-E2 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Concomitantly, 95% of these patients carry the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Although NF-E2 levels correlate with JAK2(V671F) allele burden in some PV cohorts, the molecular mechanism causing aberrant NF-E2 expression has not been described. Here we show that NF-E2 expression is also increased in patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis independent of the presence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Characterization of the NF-E2 promoter revealed multiple functional binding sites for AML1/RUNX-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter in vivo. Moreover, AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter was significantly increased in granulocytes from PV patients compared with healthy controls. AML1 mRNA expression was elevated in patients with PV, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis both in the presence and absence of JAK2(V617F). In addition, AML1 and NF-E2 expression were highly correlated. RNAi-mediated suppression of either AML1 or of its binding partner CBF-beta significantly decreased NF-E2 expression. Moreover, expression of the leukemic fusion protein AML/ETO drastically decreased NF-E2 protein levels. Our data identify NF-E2 as a novel AML1 target gene and delineate a role for aberrant AML1 expression in mediating elevated NF-E2 expression in MPN patients.((PMID:20008176))All cancers evolve by a process of genetic diversification and "natural selection" akin to the process first described by Charles Darwin for species evolution. The evolutionary, natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is almost entirely covert, clinically silent and well advanced by the point of diagnosis. It has, however, been possible to backtrack this process by molecular scrutiny of appropriate clinical samples: (i) leukemic clones in monozygotic twins that are either concordant or discordant for ALL; (ii) archived neonatal blood spots or Guthrie cards from individuals who later developed leukemia; and (iii) stored, viable cord blood cells. These studies indicate prenatal initiation of leukemia by chromosome translocation and gene fusion (or hyperdiploidy) and the post-natal acquisition of multiple, gene copy number alterations (CNAs), mostly deletions. The prenatal or first "hit" occurs very commonly, exceeding the clinical rate of ALL by some 100x and indicating a low rate of penetrance or evolutionary progression. The acquisition of the critical, secondary CNAs requires some Darwinian selective advantage to expand numbers of cells at risk, and the cytokine TGF beta is able to exercise this function. The clonal architecture of ALL has been investigated by single cell analysis with multicolor probes to mutant genes. The data reveal not a linear sequence of mutation acquisition with clonal succession but rather considerable complexity with a tree-like or branching structure of genetically distinct subclones very reminiscent of Darwin's original 1837 evolutionary divergence diagram. This evolutionary pattern has important implications for stem cells in ALL, for the origins of relapse and for therapeutic targeting.((PMID:19901261))Early relapse detection in acute myeloid leukemia is possible using standardized real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) protocols. However, optimal sampling intervals have not been defined and are likely to vary according to the underlying molecular lesion. In 74 patients experiencing hematologic relapse and harboring aberrations amenable to RQ-PCR (mutated NPM1 [designated NPM1c], PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11), we observed strikingly different relapse kinetics. The median doubling time of the CBFB-MYH11 leukemic clone was significantly longer (36 days) than that of clones harboring other markers (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 14 days; PML-RARA, 12 days; and NPM1c, 11 days; P < .001). Furthermore, we used a mathematical model to determine frequency of relapse detection and median time from detection of minimal residual disease to hematologic relapse as a function of sampling interval length. For example, to obtain a relapse detection fraction of 90% and a median time of 60 days, blood sampling every sixth month should be performed for CBFB-MYH11 leukemias. By contrast, in NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(-), NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(+), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and PML-RARA leukemias, bone marrow sampling is necessary every sixth, fourth, and fourth and second month, respectively. These data carry important implications for the development of optimal RQ-PCR monitoring schedules suitable for evaluation of minimal residual disease-directed therapies in future clinical trials.((PMID:19893343))Cytogenetic abnormalities are one of the most reliable prognostic factors in acute leukemia. Combination of conventional chromosome analysis (CCA) and FISH provides higher sensitivity in detecting these genetic abnormalities, and it is effective to apply several FISH probes as a profile test. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of FISH profile analyses in the initial diagnosis of acute leukemia.Two hundred and forty one de novo acute leukemia patients diagnosed from January, 2002 to November, 2007 were included. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia profile test, FISH probes for BCR/ABL, TEL/AML1, MLL gene rearrangement and CDKN2A deletion were used. For acute myeloid leukemia profile test, probes for AML1/ETO, MLL and CBFbeta gene rearrangement were used. The results of CCA and FISH profile tests were collected, and the positive rates were compared.ALL FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic aberrations not detected by chromosome analysis in 48.6% (67/138) of cases, including those with normal karyotypes or no mitotic cells (37%, 51/138). Among these 51 cases, TEL/AML1 abnormalities were detected in 44.3%, followed by the abnormal CDKN2A signal (24.6%) and hyperdiploidy (18.0%). AML FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic abnormalities in 7.8% (8/103) of cases.FISH analysis as a profile test detected additional genetic aberrations in a significant proportion of acute leukemia, and was effective especially in detecting cryptic translocations, submicroscopic deletions and complex karyotypes. Our study supports the need to incorporate FISH profile test at initial work up in acute leukemia.((PMID:19800266))Naturally arising regulatory T (Treg) cells express the transcription factor FoxP3, which critically controls the development and function of Treg cells. FoxP3 interacts with another transcription factor Runx1 (also known as AML1). Here, we showed that Treg cell-specific deficiency of Cbfbeta, a cofactor for all Runx proteins, or that of Runx1, but not Runx3, induced lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and hyperproduction of IgE. Cbfb-deleted Treg cells exhibited impaired suppressive function in vitro and in vivo, with altered gene expression profiles including attenuated expression of FoxP3 and high expression of interleukin-4. The Runx complex bound to more than 3000 gene loci in Treg cells, including the Foxp3 regulatory regions and the Il4 silencer. In addition, knockdown of RUNX1 showed that RUNX1 is required for the optimal regulation of FoxP3 expression in human T cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the Runx1-Cbfbeta heterodimer is indispensable for in vivo Treg cell function, in particular, suppressive activity and optimal expression of FoxP3.((PMID:19779050))((PMID:25612891))Core Binding Factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) with t(8;21) RUNX1-MTG8 or inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins often show upregulation of wild type or mutated KIT receptor. However, also non-CBF-AML frequently displays upregulated KIT expression. In the first part of this study we show that KIT expression can be also upregulated by miR-17, a regulator of RUNX1, the gene encoding a CBF subunit. Interestingly, both CBF leukemia fusion proteins and miR-17, which targets RUNX1-3'UTR, negatively affect a common core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism that forces myeloid cells into an undifferentiated, KIT-induced, proliferating state. In the second part of this study we took advantage of the conservation of the core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism in mouse and human, to mechanistically demonstrate in a mouse myeloid cell model that increased KIT-induced proliferation is per se a mechanism sufficient to delay myeloid differentiation.Human (U937) or mouse (32D) myeloid clonal lines were used, respectively, to test: 1) the effect of RUNX1-MTG8 and CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins, or upregulation of miR-17, on KIT-induced proliferation and myeloid differentiation, and 2) the effect of upregulation of KIT-induced proliferation per se on myeloid cell differentiation.In the first part of this study we found that stable miR-17 upregulation affects, like the CBF-AML fusion proteins (RUNX1-MTG8 or CBFB-MYH11), a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism leading to KIT-induced proliferation of differentiation-arrested U937 myeloid cells. In the second part of the study we harnessed the conservation of this core mechanism in human and mouse to demonstrate that the extent of KIT upregulation in 32D mouse myeloid cells with wild type RUNX1 can per se delay G-CSF-induced differentiation. The integrated information gathered from the two myeloid cell models shows that RUNX1 regulates myeloid differentiation not only by direct transcriptional regulation of coding and non-coding myeloid differentiation functions (e.g. miR-223), but also by modulating KIT-induced proliferation via non-coding miRNAs (e.g. miR-221).The novelty of this study is dual. On the one hand, miRNAs (e.g. miR-17) can mimic the effects of CBF-AML fusion proteins by affecting a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism of KIT-induced proliferation of undifferentiated myeloid cells. On the other hand, the extent of KIT-induced proliferation itself can modulate myeloid differentiation of cells with wild type RUNX1 function.((PMID:25480496))((PMID:24850758))CBFβ and RUNX1 form a DNA-binding heterodimer and are both required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) generation in mice. However, the exact role of CBFβ in the production of HSCs remains unclear. Here, we generated and characterized 2 zebrafish cbfb null mutants. The cbfb(-/-) embryos underwent primitive hematopoiesis and developed transient erythromyeloid progenitors, but they lacked definitive hematopoiesis. Unlike runx1 mutants, in which HSCs are not formed, nascent, runx1(+)/c-myb(+) HSCs were formed in cbfb(-/-) embryos. However, the nascent HSCs were not released from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, as evidenced by the accumulation of runx1(+) cells in the AGM that could not enter circulation. Moreover, wild-type embryos treated with an inhibitor of RUNX1-CBFβ interaction, Ro5-3335, phenocopied the hematopoietic defects in cbfb(-/-) mutants, rather than those in runx1(-/-) mutants. Finally, we found that cbfb was downstream of the Notch pathway during HSC development. Our data suggest that runx1 and cbfb are required at 2 different steps during early HSC development. CBFβ is not required for nascent HSC emergence but is required for the release of HSCs from AGM into circulation. Our results also indicate that RUNX1 can drive the emergence of nascent HSCs in the AGM without its heterodimeric partner CBFβ.((PMID:24677539))Runx1 and Cbfβ are critical for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and are implicated in leukemic transformation. Despite the absolute requirements for these factors in the development of hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes, their roles in the development of bone marrow progenitor subsets have not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that Cbfβ is essential for the development of Flt3(+) macrophage-dendritic cell (DC) progenitors in the bone marrow and all DC subsets in the periphery. Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression of Irf8 restors DC differentiation. These results demonstrate that Runx proteins and Cbfβ restrict granulocyte lineage commitment to facilitate multilineage hematopoietic differentiation and thus identify their novel tumor suppressor function in myeloid leukemia.((PMID:24449215))RUNX1/CBFβ (core binding factor [CBF]) is a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations, point mutations, or deletions in acute leukemia. The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is also frequently involved in chromosomal translocations or partial tandem duplication in acute leukemia. The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. RUNX1/CBFβ recruits MLL to regulate downstream target genes. However, the functional consequence of MLL fusions on RUNX1/CBFβ activity has not been fully understood. In this report, we show that MLL fusion proteins and the N-terminal MLL portion of MLL fusions downregulate RUNX1 and CBFβ protein expression via the MLL CXXC domain and flanking regions. We confirmed this finding in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice and human M4/M5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, with or without MLL translocations, showing that MLL translocations cause a hypomorph phenotype of RUNX1/CBFβ. Overexpression of RUNX1 inhibits the development of AML in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice; conversely, further reducing Runx1/Cbfβ levels accelerates MLL-AF9-mediated AML in bone marrow transplantation assays. These data reveal a newly defined negative regulation of RUNX1/CBFβ by MLL fusion proteins and suggest that targeting RUNX1/CBFβ levels may be a potential therapy for MLLs.((PMID:24402281))The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protein Vif has a central role in the neutralization of host innate defences by hijacking cellular proteasomal degradation pathways to subvert the antiviral activity of host restriction factors; however, the underlying mechanism by which Vif achieves this remains unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of the Vif-CBF-β-CUL5-ELOB-ELOC complex. The structure reveals that Vif, by means of two domains, organizes formation of the pentameric complex by interacting with CBF-β, CUL5 and ELOC. The larger domain (α/β domain) of Vif binds to the same side of CBF-β as RUNX1, indicating that Vif and RUNX1 are exclusive for CBF-β binding. Interactions of the smaller domain (α-domain) of Vif with ELOC and CUL5 are cooperative and mimic those of SOCS2 with the latter two proteins. A unique zinc-finger motif of Vif, which is located between the two Vif domains, makes no contacts with the other proteins but stabilizes the conformation of the α-domain, which may be important for Vif-CUL5 interaction. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for Vif hijacking of the CBF-β and CUL5 E3 ligase complex, laying a foundation for rational design of novel anti-HIV drugs.((PMID:24002588))Different mechanisms for CBFβ-MYH11 function in acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) have been proposed such as tethering of RUNX1 outside the nucleus, interference with transcription factor complex assembly and recruitment of histone deacetylases, all resulting in transcriptional repression of RUNX1 target genes. Here, through genome-wide CBFβ-MYH11-binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics, we found that CBFβ-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters, where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the coregulators EP300 and HDAC1. Transcriptional analysis revealed that upon fusion protein knockdown, a small subset of the CBFβ-MYH11 target genes show increased expression, confirming a role in transcriptional repression. However, the majority of CBFβ-MYH11 target genes, including genes implicated in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal such as ID1, LMO1 and JAG1, are actively transcribed and repressed upon fusion protein knockdown. Together these results suggest an essential role for CBFβ-MYH11 in regulating the expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell phenotype.((PMID:23877199))The rare but recurrent RUNX1-USP42 fusion gene is the result of a t(7;21)(p22;q22) chromosomal translocation and has been described in 6 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and one case of refractory anemia with excess of blast. In the present study, we present the molecular genetic analysis and the clinical features of a t(7;21)(p22;q22)-positive AML case. PCR amplified two RUNX1-USP42 cDNA fragments but no reciprocal USP42-RUNX1 fragment indicating that the RUNX1-USP42 is the leukemogenic fusion gene. Sequencing of the two amplified fragments showed that exon 6 or exon 7 of RUNX1 (accession number NM_001754 version 3) was fused to exon 3 of USP42 (accession number NM_032172 version 2). The predicted RUNX1-USP42 fusion protein would contain the Runt homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for heterodimerization with CBFB and for DNA binding, and the catalytic UCH (ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydroxylase) domain of the USP42 protein. The bone marrow cells in the present case also had a 5q deletion, and it was revealed that 5 out of the 8 reported cases (including the present case) with t(7;21)(p22;q22)/RUNX1-USP42 also had cytogenetic abnormalities of 5q. The fact that t(7;21) and 5q- occur together much more often than chance would allow seems to be unquestionable, although the pathogenetic connection between the two aberrations remains unknown.((PMID:23646898))Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and genetic rearrangements involving the core binding factor (CBF) have favorable prognosis. In contrast, a minority of them still have a high risk of leukemia recurrence. This study investigated the adverse features of CBF AML that could justify investigational therapeutic approaches.One hundred and fifty patients (median age 42 yr, range 16-69) with CBF AML (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 n = 74; CBFB-MYH11 n = 76) were prospectively enrolled into two consecutive CETLAM protocols at 19 Spanish institutions. Main clinic and biologic parameters were analyzed in the whole series. In non-selected cases with available DNA samples, the impact of molecular characterization and minimal residual disease (MRD) was also studied.Overall, complete remission (CR) rate was 89% (94% in ≤50 yr old and 72% in >50 yr, P = 0.002). At 5 yr, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 26 ± 1%, disease-free survival (DFS) 62 ± 6%, and overall survival (OS) 66 ± 4%. In multivariate analyses, leukocyte count above 20 × 10(9) /L, BAALC over-expression, and high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy (CT) led to increased relapse rate. Regarding OS, age >50 yr, leukocyte count above 20 × 10(9) /L, and increased MN1 expression were adverse features.Age, leukocyte counts, BAALC, and MN1 gene expressions as well as high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy are useful tools to predict the outcome and should be considered for risk-adapted therapy.((PMID:23053179))Core binding factor (CBF)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents a favorable prognosis, except for patients with KIT mutation, especially D816 mutation. The current retrospective study attempted to validate a prognostic role of KIT mutation in 121 Korean patients with CBF AML. The study patients consisted of 121 patients with CBF AML (82 patients with RUNX1/RUNX1T1 [67.8 %] and 39 patients with CBFB/MYH11 [32.2 %]) recruited from eight institutions in Korea. All patients received idarubicin plus cytarabine or behenoyl cytosine arabinoside 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy. The KIT gene mutation status was determined by direct sequencing analyses. A KIT mutation was detected in 32 cases (26.4 %) in our series of patients. The KIT mutation was most frequent in exon 17 (n = 18, 14.9 %; n = 16 with D816 mutation), followed by exon 8 (n = 10, 8.3 %). The presence of KIT D816 mutation was associated with adverse outcomes for the event-free survival (p = 0.03) and for the overall survival (p = 0.02). The unfavorable impact of D816 mutation was more prominent when the analysis was confined to the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 subtype. The KIT mutation was detected in 26.4 % of Korean patients with CBF AML. The KIT D816 mutation demonstrated an unfavorable prognostic implication, particularly in the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 subtype.((PMID:22912405))Core binding factor (CBF) leukemias, those with translocations or inversions that affect transcription factor genes RUNX1 or CBFB, account for ~24% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 25% of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Current treatments for CBF leukemias are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 5-y survival rate of ~50%. We hypothesize that the interaction between RUNX1 and CBFβ is critical for CBF leukemia and can be targeted for drug development. We developed high-throughput AlphaScreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) methods to quantify the RUNX1-CBFβ interaction and screen a library collection of 243,398 compounds. Ro5-3335, a benzodiazepine identified from the screen, was able to interact with RUNX1 and CBFβ directly, repress RUNX1/CBFB-dependent transactivation in reporter assays, and repress runx1-dependent hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. Ro5-3335 preferentially killed human CBF leukemia cell lines, rescued preleukemic phenotype in a RUNX1-ETO transgenic zebrafish, and reduced leukemia burden in a mouse CBFB-MYH11 leukemia model. Our data thus confirmed that RUNX1-CBFβ interaction can be targeted for leukemia treatment and we have identified a promising lead compound for this purpose.((PMID:22875911))The clinical value of serial minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by quantitative RT-PCR was prospectively assessed in 278 patients [163 with t(8;21) and 115 with inv(16)] entered in the United Kingdom MRC AML 15 trial. CBF transcripts were normalized to 10(5) ABL copies. At remission, after course 1 induction chemotherapy, a > 3 log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts in BM in t(8;21) patients and a > 10 CBFB-MYH11 copy number in peripheral blood (PB) in inv(16) patients were the most useful prognostic variables for relapse risk on multivariate analysis. MRD levels after consolidation (course 3) were also informative. During follow-up, cut-off MRD thresholds in BM and PB associated with a 100% relapse rate were identified: for t(8;21) patients BM > 500 copies, PB > 100 copies; for inv(16) patients, BM > 50 copies and PB > 10 copies. Rising MRD levels on serial monitoring accurately predicted hematologic relapse. During follow-up, PB sampling was equally informative as BM for MRD detection. We conclude that MRD monitoring by quantitative RT-PCR at specific time points in CBF AML allows identification of patients at high risk of relapse and could now be incorporated in clinical trials to evaluate the role of risk directed/preemptive therapy.((PMID:22722202))Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2008 alone. This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.((PMID:22491093))Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that involves the destruction of articular cartilage and eventually leads to disability. Molecules that promote the selective differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes may stimulate the repair of damaged cartilage. Using an image-based high-throughput screen, we identified the small molecule kartogenin, which promotes chondrocyte differentiation (median effective concentration = 100 nM), shows chondroprotective effects in vitro, and is efficacious in two OA animal models. Kartogenin binds filamin A, disrupts its interaction with the transcription factor core-binding factor β subunit (CBFβ), and induces chondrogenesis by regulating the CBFβ-RUNX1 transcriptional program. This work provides new insights into the control of chondrogenesis that may ultimately lead to a stem cell-based therapy for osteoarthritis.((PMID:22325351))Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play key roles in developmental epigenetic regulation. Yet the mechanisms that target PRCs to specific loci in mammalian cells remain incompletely understood. In this study we show that Bmi1, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), binds directly to the Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex. Genome-wide studies in megakaryocytic cells demonstrate significant chromatin occupancy overlap between the PRC1 core component Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ and functional regulation of a considerable fraction of commonly bound genes. Bmi1/Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ deficiencies generate partial phenocopies of one another in vivo. We also show that Ring1b occupies key Runx1 binding sites in primary murine thymocytes and that this occurs via PRC2-independent mechanisms. Genetic depletion of Runx1 results in reduced Ring1b binding at these sites in vivo. These findings provide evidence for site-specific PRC1 chromatin recruitment by core binding transcription factors in mammalian cells.((PMID:27667292))Fluorescence in situ hybridization examination of a pediatric AML patient whose bone marrow cells carried trisomy 4 and FLT3-ITD mutation, demonstrated that part of the RUNX1 probe had unexpectedly moved to chromosome band 6q25 indicating a cryptic t(6;21)(q25;q22) translocation. RNA sequencing showed fusion of exon 7 of RUNX1 with an intergenic sequence of 6q25 close to the MIR1202 locus, something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. The RUNX1 fusion transcript encodes a truncated protein containing the Runt homology domain responsible for both heterodimerization with CBFB and DNA binding, but lacking the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PST) region which is the transcription activation domain at the C terminal end. Which genetic event (+4, FLT3-ITD, t(6;21)-RUNX1 truncation or other, undetected acquired changes) was more pathogenetically important in the present case of AML, remains unknown. The case illustrates that submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements may accompany visible numerical changes and perhaps should be actively looked for whenever a single trisomy is found. An active search for them may provide both pathogenetic and prognostic novel information.((PMID:27632978))The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system defines recurrent chromosomal translocations as the sole diagnostic and prognostic criteria for acute leukemia (AL). These fusion transcripts are pivotal in the pathogenesis of AL. Clinical laboratories universally employ conventional karyotype/FISH to detect these chromosomal translocations, which is complex, labour intensive and lacks multiplexing capacity. Hence, it is imperative to explore and evaluate some newer automated, cost-efficient multiplexed technologies to accommodate the expanding genetic landscape in AL."nCounter® Leukemia fusion gene expression assay" by NanoString was employed to detect various fusion transcripts in a large set samples (n = 94) utilizing RNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) diagnostic bone marrow biopsy specimens. This series included AL patients with various recurrent translocations (n = 49), normal karyotype (n = 19), or complex karyotype (n = 21), as well as normal bone marrow samples (n = 5). Fusion gene expression data were compared with results obtained by conventional karyotype and FISH technology to determine sensitivity/specificity, as well as positive /negative predictive values.Junction probes for PML/RARA; RUNX1-RUNX1T1; BCR/ABL1 showed 100 % sensitivity/specificity. A high degree of correlation was noted for MLL/AF4 (85 sensitivity/100 specificity) and TCF3-PBX1 (75 % sensitivity/100 % specificity) probes. CBFB-MYH11 fusion probes showed moderate sensitivity (57 %) but high specificity (100 %). ETV6/RUNX1 displayed discordance between fusion transcript assay and FISH results as well as rare non-specific binding in AL samples with normal or complex cytogenetics.Our study presents preliminary data with high correlation between fusion transcript detection by a throughput automated multiplexed platform, compared to conventional karyotype/FISH technique for detection of chromosomal translocations in AL patients. Our preliminary observations, mandates further vast validation studies to explore automated molecular platforms in diagnostic pathology.((PMID:27512765))The identification of minimal residual disease (MRD) has led to substantial improvements in early recognition of the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Flow cytometry (FC), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization are useful methods for the detection of MRD in AML patients although molecular monitoring of leukemia-specific rearranged (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11) or mutated genetic (NPM1, CEBPA) sequences represents the most sensitive methodology. Besides, more than 50% of all AML patients lack one of these specific sequences, so it is crucial to identify molecular targets applicable for the majority of patients. WT1 is overexpressed at the mRNA level in 80–90% of AML cases at diagnosis in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, and is detectable in a consistent low range in normal donors. These features have led to its adoption for MRD detection using RQ-PCR. A European LeukemiaNet Study found the magnitude of WT1 log reduction after induction chemotherapy to be an independent predictor of relapse. Other studies showed a poorer outcome in patients having WT1 levels above reference thresholds at specific time points. WT1 expression was compared with other modalities of MRD assessment, such as RQ-PCR of specific fusion genes and FC, but no differences in terms of predictive value emerged. Finally, some authors translated the use of WT1 in the clinic giving donor lymphocytes infusions to patients with increasing WT1-mRNA levels after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and obtaining an improvement of survival in this subset. Data collected on WT1 expression over the past years provided evidence for the use of this molecular marker to stratify high-risk AML patients. It can also be used as a marker for early interventional therapy, but further studies are needed to demonstrate it.((PMID:27460049))Detection of leukemogenic fusion transcripts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is critical for AML diagnosis. NanoString nCounter system is a novel probe-based gene expression platform capable of measuring up to 800 targets with advantages of reproducibility, accuracy, and sample type flexibility. To study the potential application of NanoString in leukemia at clinic, we used this technology to detect AML leukemogenic fusion transcripts and compared the performances with clinical molecular assays.We developed a NanoString assay to detect seven leukemogenic fusion transcripts, namely RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (e5e12), PML-RARA (bcr1, bcr2, and bcr3), and CBFB-MYH11 (e5e12, e5e8, and e5e7). We set up the cut-off value for each fusion transcript and tested 42 de novo AML samples. We compared the results with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TaqMan reverse quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), the molecular methods standardly used at clinic.We demonstrated that the NanoString and RT-PCR results correlate well (P < 0.0001) and are highly concordant (95.2%). Using TaqMan RQ-PCR as a validation method and gold standard, we demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity of NanoString compared to RT-PCR and comparable specificity. Furthermore, we showed that NanoString is not as sensitive as TaqMan RQ-PCR in detecting very low level of fusion transcripts.NanoString can serve as a reliable and alternative molecular method to multiplexed RT-PCR for diagnosis of de novo AML with the perspective of screening/quantitation of a large number of leukemogenic fusion transcripts and prognostic genes. However, NanoString may not be an alternative method for monitoring minimal residual disease in AML.((PMID:27298396))To examine the value of minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We studied 42 patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and 51 with inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 Tandem MRD analyses by MFC and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed in 281 bone marrow (BM) samples.Grouping qRT-PCR levels as ≤0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10, and >10%, and reporting MFC (sensitivity, 0.1%-0.01%) as positive or negative, κ coefficient test showed no agreement between qRT-PCR and MFC in BM samples obtained postinduction (n = 44, κ = 0.041), and only weak agreement during consolidation (n = 108, κ = 0.083), maintenance/follow-up (n = 107, κ = 0.164), and salvage chemotherapy (n = 24, 0.376). In the post induction BM samples, while qRT-PCR <0.1% was associated with lower and ≥10% with higher AML relapse risk (P = .035), qRT-PCR between 0.1% to 1% and 1% to 10% failed to predict relapse. In the latter group with intermediate qRT-PCR results, MFC provided prognostic value for relapse (P = 0.006).MFC and qRT-PCR are complementary tests in monitoring CBF AML MRD.((PMID:27022003))Cytogenetic analyses of a consecutive series of 67 paediatric (median age 8 years; range 0-17) de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients revealed aberrations in 55 (82%) cases. The most common subgroups were KMT2A rearrangement (29%), normal karyotype (15%), RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (10%), deletions of 5q, 7q and/or 17p (9%), myeloid leukaemia associated with Down syndrome (7%), PML-RARA (7%) and CBFB-MYH11 (5%). Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analysis and exon sequencing of 100 genes, performed in 52 and 40 cases, respectively (39 overlapping), revealed ≥1 aberration in 89%; when adding cytogenetic data, this frequency increased to 98%. Uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs) were detected in 13% and copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 63% (median 2/case); three UPIDs and 22 CNAs were recurrent. Twenty-two genes were targeted by focal CNAs, including AEBP2 and PHF6 deletions and genes involved in AML-associated gene fusions. Deep sequencing identified mutations in 65% of cases (median 1/case). In total, 60 mutations were found in 30 genes, primarily those encoding signalling proteins (47%), transcription factors (25%), or epigenetic modifiers (13%). Twelve genes (BCOR, CEBPA, FLT3, GATA1, KIT, KRAS, NOTCH1, NPM1, NRAS, PTPN11, SMC3 and TP53) were recurrently mutated. We conclude that SNP-A and deep sequencing analyses complement the cytogenetic diagnosis of paediatric AML.((PMID:26890219))Cbfb is a cotranscription factor that forms a heterodimer with Runx proteins Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3. It is required for fetal liver hematopoiesis and skeletal development. Cbfb has two functional isoforms, Cbfb1 and Cbfb2, which are formed by alternative splicing. To address the biological functions of these isoforms in skeletal development, we examined Cbfb1(-/-) and Cbfb2(-/-) mouse embryos. Intramembranous and endochondral ossification was retarded and chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation was inhibited in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos but not in Cbfb1(-/-) embryos. Cbfb2 mRNA was upregulated in calvariae, limbs, livers, thymuses, and hearts of Cbfb1(-/-) embryos but Cbfb1 mRNA was not in those of Cbfb2(-/-) embryos, and the total amount of Cbfb1 and Cbfb2 mRNA in Cbfb1(-/-) embryos was similar to that in wild-type embryos but was severely reduced in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos. The absolute numbers of Cbfb2 mRNA in calvariae, limbs, livers, thymuses, and brains in wild-type embryos were about three times higher than those of Cbfb1 in the respective tissue. The levels of Runx proteins were reduced in calvariae, limbs, and primary osteoblasts from Cbfb2(-/-) embryos, but the reduction in Runx2 protein was very mild. Furthermore, the amounts of Runx proteins and Cbfb in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos differed similarly among skeletal tissues, livers, and thymuses, suggesting that Runx proteins and Cbfb are mutually required for their stability. Although Cbfb1(-/-) embryos developed normally, Cbfb1 induced chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and enhanced DNA binding of Runx2 more efficiently than Cbfb2. Our results indicate that modulations in the relative levels of the isoforms may adjust transcriptional activation by Runx2 to appropriate physiological levels. Cbfb2 was more abundant, but Cbfb1 was more potent for enhancing Runx2 activity. Although only Cbfb2 loss generated overt skeletal phenotypes, both may play major roles in skeletal development with functional redundancy. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.((PMID:26165235))RUNX1 and CBFB are among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukemias. Genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations, copy number variations and point mutations have been widely reported to result in the malfunction of RUNX transcription factors. Leukemias arising from such alterations in RUNX family genes are collectively termed core binding factor (CBF) leukemias. Although adult CBF leukemias generally are considered a favorable risk group as compared with other forms of acute myeloid leukemia, the 5-year survival rate remains low. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanism for CBF leukemia is imperative to uncover novel treatment options. Over the years, retroviral transduction-transplantation assays and transgenic, knockin and knockout mouse models alone or in combination with mutagenesis have been used to study the roles of RUNX alterations in leukemogenesis. Although successful in inducing leukemia, the existing assays and models possess many inherent limitations. A CBF leukemia model which induces leukemia with complete penetrance and short latency would be ideal as a platform for drug discovery. Here, we summarize the currently available mouse models which have been utilized to study CBF leukemias, discuss the advantages and limitations of individual experimental systems, and propose suggestions for improvements of mouse models.((PMID:25732229))In a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following therapy, finding ≥5% bone marrow (BM) blasts is highly concerning for residual/relapsed disease. Over an 18-month period, we performed multicolor flow cytometry immunophenotyping (MFC) for AML minimal residual disease on >4,000 BM samples, and identified 41 patients who had ≥5% myeloblasts by morphology but negative by MFC. At the time of a negative MFC study, an abnormal cytogenetic study converted to negative in 14 patients and remained positive at a low level (2.5-9.5%) by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 3 (14%), of the latter, abnormalities subsequently disappeared in the repeated BM in 2 patients. Positive pretreatment mutations, including FLT3, NPM1, IDH1, CEBPA, became negative in all 10 patients tested. Of the seven patients with favorable cytogenetics, PML/RARA, CBFB-MYH11 or RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts were detected at various levels in six patients but all patients remained in complete remission. With no additional chemotherapy given, 39 patients had BM repeated (median 2 weeks, range <1-21), and all cases showed <5% BM blasts and a continuously negative MFC. In the end of follow-up (median 10 months, range 1-22), 13 patients experienced relapse, 12/13 showing clonal cytogenetic evolution/switch and 11 demonstrating major immunophenotypic shifts. We conclude that MFC is useful in identifying a regenerating BM sample with ≥5% BM blasts that would otherwise be scored as positive using standard morphologic examination. We believe this conclusion is supported by the changes in molecular cytogenetic status and the patient clinical follow-up data.((PMID:25715404))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia is a favorable acute myeloid leukemia subset cytogenetically defined by t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16) rearrangements, disrupting RUNX1 (previously CBFA/AML1) or CBFB transcription factor functions. The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is expressed in the vast majority of these acute myeloid leukemias and frequent activating KIT gene mutations have been associated with a higher risk of relapse. This phase II study aimed to evaluate dasatinib as maintenance therapy in patients with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia in first hematologic complete remission, but at higher risk of relapse due to molecular disease persistence or recurrence. A total of 26 patients aged 18-60 years old previously included in the CBF-2006 trial were eligible to receive dasatinib 140 mg daily if they had a poor initial molecular response (n=18) or a molecular recurrence (n=8). The tolerance of dasatinib as maintenance therapy was satisfactory. The 2-year disease-free survival in this high-risk population of patients was 25.7%. All but one patient with molecular recurrence presented subsequent hematologic relapse. Patients with slow initial molecular response had a similar disease-free survival when treated with dasatinib (40.2% at 2 years) or without any maintenance (50.0% at 2 years). The disappearance of KIT gene mutations at relapse suggests that clonal devolution may in part explain the absence of efficacy observed with single-agent dasatinib in these patients (n. EudraCT: 2006-006555-12).((PMID:25635758))In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) and/or the corresponding molecular rearrangements RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and CBFB/MYH11 [collectively referred to as core binding factor (CBF) AML] predict for a more favourable outcome in patients receiving cytarabine-anthracycline based induction and upon achievement of complete remission, high-dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy. However, 40-45% of these patients eventually relapse and die of their disease. Here, we review emerging molecular and therapeutic results that may be used to guide the clinical management of this subset of patients.Integration of cytogenetic results with molecular genetic and epigenetic data refines the diagnosis, classification and risk-stratification of CBF AML. Clinical studies with targeting compounds (e.g. gemtuzumab ozogamicin, dasatinib) added to intensive chemotherapy appear beneficial both in younger and older patients, albeit the latter continue to have a significantly worse outcome than the former. Regularly molecular monitoring of disease during remission may provide a strategy for early therapeutic intervention before overt relapse.Emerging evidence supports that novel diagnostic, treatment and molecular disease monitoring approaches may improve the prognosis of CBF AML.((PMID:25348871))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) - including AML with t(8;21) and AML with inv(16) - accounts for about 15% of adult AML and is associated with a relatively favorable prognosis. Nonetheless, relapse incidence may reach 40% in these patients. In this context, identification of prognostic markers is considered of great interest. Due to similarities between their molecular and prognostic features, t(8;21) and inv(16)-AML are usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies. However, considerable experimental evidences have highlighted that they represent two distinct entities and should be considered separately for further studies. This review summarizes recent laboratory and clinical findings in this particular subset of AML and how they could be used to improve management of patients in routine practice.((PMID:27468869))The diagnostics of leukemia relies upon multi-parametric approach involving a number of different pathology disciplines such as flow cytometry, histopathology, cytogenetics and molecular genetics [fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. Childhood leukemia is often determined by the presence of specific chromosomal translocation that entails the generation of preleukemic fusion genes (PFG). In the last two decades, several studies have reported observations that PFG are present in healthy population and not necessarily result in leukemia. The first such study by Limpens and colleagues on t(14/18)/ BCL2-JH [1] and next in line [2, 3] led to many questions regarding the significance of these chromosomal translocations in leukemogenesis. However, the data on the incidence of PFG are contradictive. This review aims to highlight the molecular genetic approaches used by various studies with regard to differences in diagnostics and incidence of PFG in healthy subjects. The focus is on the incidence and prevalence of the most common PFG such as TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, BCR-ABL (p190), AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11 detected in umbilical cord blood, in neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards (GC)), bone marrow, peripheral blood and tissues of amortized fetuses. We conclude that the incidence of PFG is significantly higher than incidence of leukemia and more sophisticated analysis of PFG in leukemogenic cell populations is warranted to relate the occurrence of PFG with leukemia. The emerging notion is that only those PFG may contribute to development of leukemia which arise in stem cells at specific time windows during development. Thus, screening of PFG in subpopulations of stem cells may be a challenge for assessment of predisposition to leukemia and for validation of cell transplant to minimize donor cell-derived leukemia.((PMID:26299742))In this work, we evaluated the incidence and prognostic value of several genetic aberrations in patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We analysed 90 patients: 42 males (mean age 54.5 years) and 48 females (mean age 59 years), with AML. The genetics of all leukemia samples was studied using conventional cytogenetics, the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation as well as the standardized RTPCR protocol.In 34.4% of patients, we detected at least one of the analysed genetic aberrations, except the CBFB MYH11, which we did not detect. Translocation t(8;21)/ AML1 ETO was found in 4.4% of patients with a mean age of 45.4 years, while none of these patients was older than 55 years. Translocation t(15;17)/ PMLRARA was found in 5.5% of patients with a mean age of 52.6 years and an almost equal distribution between younger and older patients. The MLL gene rearrangements were found in 6.6% of patients, the -5/ 5q- and/ or -7/ 7q- aberrations in 7.7% of patients, while the most frequent genetic abnormality in our study was trisomy 8 (10%). Moreover, we found a favorable clinical outcome in patients expressing fusion genes AML1-ETO or PMLRARA in contrast to an adverse clinical outcome with few remissions and death in AML patients with MLL, -5q/ -5 and -7q/ 7-. Finally, an intermediate prognosis was found in patients with trisomy 8.In this study, we found a good congruence with published literature on the incidence and prognostic value of several well established AML-associated genetic aberrations. This simple genetic-based classification system helps us to identify patients with a favorable, intermediate or unfavorable prognosis and to treat them with the best currently available therapy. However, analysis of new genetically defined abnormalities in AML is necessary for development of better therapeutic strategies and/or diagnostics.((PMID:24602728))To investigate the clinical value of multiplex nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-nPCR) in screening acute myeloid leukemia(AML)fusion genes.A novel multiplex RT-nPCR assay was developed to detect 16 AML-related fusion genes (AML1-EVI1, AML1-ETO, AML1-MDS1, AML1-MTG16, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, MLL-MLL, PML-RARα, PLZFRARα, NPM1-RARα, CBFB-MYH11, DEK-CAN, SET-CAN and TLS-ERG) according to 2008 WHO classification of AML. The chromosome reciprocal translocations of 356 AML cases were detected by multiplex RT-nPCR and karyotyping. The positive samples were further confirmed by split- out PCR and FISH.The fusion genes were detected in 172 patients with the positive detection rate of 48.31%(172/356), which was higher than that of karyotyping (31.46%) (χ²=70.314, P<0.01). Multiplex RT-nPCR is superior to karyotyping and FISH in identifying the rare, cryptic chromosome translocation (χ²=96.074, P<0.01).The multiplex RT-nPCR used in this study can quickly, effectively and accurately screen the fusion genes in AML patients, which can provide important evidence for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and also provide necessary information for minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognosis.((PMID:23257420))Within the past few years, the invention of next-generation sequencing has revealed several new genes associated with tumor formation and development, for example DNMT3a. This gene is an independent prognostic factor for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The objective of this study was to analyze the DNMT3a mutation in childhood AML in a single center. PCR amplification of the entire coding region of DNMT3a was performed using 23 overlapping primer pairs in 57 patients who were diagnosed in Blood Disease Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, then the directly sequencing was underwent. The results showed that no DNMT3a mutation was found in these patients including the hotspot R882. But AML1/ETO mutation was found in 10 patients, CBFB/MYH11 mutation in 3 patients, PML/RARa mutation in 13 patients, FLT3/ITD mutation in 5 patients, FLT3/TKD mutation in 1 patient, PML/RARa and FLT3/TKD mutation coexisted in 2 patients. It is concluded that DNMT3a mutations are rare in childhood AML, and different mechanisms of myeloid leukemogenesis between childhood and adults maybe involved.((PMID:22196957))Despite a high remission rate, a significant number of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Thus, the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML is an important strategy to better identify high risk patients. Most sensitive methodology to detect MRD is molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but its applicability is restricted to AML with leukemia-specific molecular targets (e.g. AML1-ETO, CBFB-MYH11, MLL, FLT-3). In our study, MRD was monitored at different time points with both MFC and WT1-RNA quantification in 23 AML patients who did not present specific molecular targets. As previously published, we considered values of 10(-3) (0.1%) in MFC and 90 WT1-RNA × 10(4) ABL copies as optimal thresholds. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to confirm these data. To realize the methodology that better identify high risk patients, an analysis of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (PV) and likelihood ratio (LR) was provided and similar results were showed. MRD levels ≥ 10(-3) in MFC as well MRD levels ≥ 90 WT1-RNA copies in RQ-PCR, identify risk groups of patients with poor prognosis. Therefore, MFC and WT1-RNA quantification showed a comparable capacity in terms of technical performance and clinical significance to identify high risk patients who eventually relapsed.((PMID:22145956))The KIT D816V mutation is detected in the vast majority of adult cases of systemic mastocytosis (SM). The mutation is also frequently detected in core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF AML) defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1;q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 chromosomal rearrangements, but whether the mutation is indicative of associated SM is unclear. In the present study, patients with CBF AML were therefore analyzed for the KIT D816V mutation and mutation positive cases subsequently analyzed for the presence of SM. The KIT D816V mutation was detected in eight of 20 cases of CBF AML, with the frequency in t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13.1;q22) positive cases being 31% and 57%, respectively. The fraction of KIT D816V mutation positive cells was highly variable among the eight mutation positive patients, with levels ranging from 0.04 to 98% in a pretreatment blood sample. Five of the eight cases carried the mutation in a cell fraction below one-tenth of the blast cell fraction, thus suggesting that KIT mutation is often a late event in leukemogenesis. None of the eight KIT D816V mutation positive cases fulfilled the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria of SM. The presence of the KIT D816V mutation in the CBF AML subgroup can therefore not be considered indicative of associated SM.((PMID:22032582))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cytogenetically defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), commonly abbreviated as t(8;21) and inv(16), respectively. In both subtypes, the cytogenetic rearrangements disrupt genes that encode subunits of core-binding factor, a transcription factor that functions as an essential regulator of normal hematopoiesis. The rearrangements t(8;21) and inv(16) involve the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 ( AML1-ETO ) and CBFB/MYH11 genes, respectively. These 2 subtypes are categorized as AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, and hence the cytogenetic fusion transcripts are considered diagnostic of acute leukemia even when the marrow blast count is less than 20%. The t(8;21) and inv(16) subtypes of AML have been usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies; however, recent studies have demonstrated genetic, clinical, and prognostic differences, supporting the notion that they represent 2 distinct biologic and clinical entities. This review summarizes the spectrum of this subset of AMLs, with particular emphasis on molecular genetics and pathologic findings.((PMID:21354057))Leukemia- and lymphoma-associated (LLA) chromosomal rearrangements are critical in the process of tumorigenesis. These genetic alterations are also important biological markers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of hematopoietic malignant diseases. To detect the presence or absence of these genetic alterations in healthy individuals, sensitive nested RT-PCR analyses were performed on a large number of peripheral blood samples for selected markers including MLL partial tandem duplications (PTDs), BCR-ABL p190, BCR-ABL p210, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11. Using nested RT-PCR, the presence of all of these selected markers was detected in healthy individuals at various prevalence rates. No correlation was observed between incidence and age except for BCR-ABL p210 fusion, the incidence of which rises with increasing age. In addition, nested RT-PCR was performed on a large cohort of umbilical cord blood samples for MLL PTD, BCR-ABL p190 and BCR-ABL p210. The results demonstrated the presence of these aberrations in cord blood from healthy neonates. To our knowledge, the presence of PML-RARA and CBFB-MYH11 in healthy individuals has not been previously described. The present study provides further evidence for the presence of LLA genetic alterations in healthy individuals and suggests that these mutations are not themselves sufficient for malignant transformation.((PMID:21344764))The aim of the paper is to present the initial results of molecular examination which was started in 2006 for children with acute myeloid leukemia. Better knowledge of biology of this disease, can result in establishing of new risk factors what allows more precise patient stratification to different therapeutic groups. Study was obtained patients until to 18 years of age treated according to AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol in 14 centers of the Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. Mononuclear cells were collected from bone marrow on time points established according to the AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol. Collected cells were isolated on Ficoll gradient, and RNA and DNA were isolated using TRIZOL reagent. To synthesize cDNA an amount of 1 mg of total RNA was used. To perform quantitative RT-PCR and RQ-PCR reactions 4 fusion gene transcripts (AML1-ETO, CBFb-MYH11, PML-RARA /subtype bcrl and bcr3/) were used according to the protocol established by Europe Against Cancer Program. An expression of WT1 gene was tested additionally. An analysis of ABL control gene was used to normalize of achieved results. Determination of duplication of FLT3 gene in DNA sample was performed with starters complementary to JM region. Genotyping was performed in 75 patients with acute myeloid leukemia so far. AML1-ETO fusion gene transcript was found in 14 patients (19%). PML-RARA (subtype bcr3) and CBFB-MYH11 gene transcripts were detected in 3 (4%) and 3 (4%) patients, respectively. Duplication of FLT3 gene was found in 4 (5.3%) cases. Between 67 tested children over expression of WT1 was present in 51 patients (76%). Analysis of MRD level in subsequent time points showed systematic decrease of number of fusion gene transcript copies and gene WT1 expression. To establish the rate of molecular marker presence in AML in children and the influence of the presence of MRD on the treatment results as well, the study has to be conducted on a larger group of patients with longer follow-up.((PMID:21198299))Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) accounts for 15 to 25 percent of childhood acute leukemias. The most common genetic abnormalities seen in pediatric AML patients are AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes resulting in t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16). These genetic defects are seen in approximately 20-25% of AML patients.We investigated in this study, incidence and prognostic significance of the AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes in children with AML.The authors analyzed 34 children with AML using the real time-polymerase chain reaction for AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes.Of the patients, 8.8% were positive for t(8;21), 8.8% for t(15;17) and 3% for inv(16). There were a statistically significant differences between 48 month overall survival rates of the patients positive and negative for t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16).It was concluded that t(15;17), t(8;21) and inv(16) impact on disease prognosis positively, but comprehensive studies with larger patient series are now needed for confirmation.((PMID:21123134))Nowadays, the presence of specific genetic aberrations is progressively used for classification and treatment stratification, because acute leukemias with the same oncogenetic aberration generally form a clinically and diagnostically homogenous disease entity with comparable prognosis. Many oncogenetic aberrations in acute leukemias result in a fusion gene, which is transcribed into fusion transcripts and translated into fusion proteins, which are assumed to play a critical role in the oncogenetic process. Fusion gene aberrations are detected by karyotyping, FISH, or RT-PCR analysis. However, these molecular genetic techniques are laborious and time consuming, which is in contrast to flow cytometric techniques. Therefore we developed a flow cytometric immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins in lysates of leukemia cell samples by use of a bead-bound catching antibody against one side of the fusion protein and fluorochrome-conjugated detection antibody. So far, we have been able to design such fusion protein immunobead assays for BCR-ABL, PML-RARA, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11. The immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins can be performed within 3 to 4 hours in a routine diagnostic setting, without the need of special equipment other than a flow cytometer. The novel immunobead assay will enable fast and easy classification of acute leukemia patients that express fusion proteins. Such patients can be included at an early stage in the right treatment protocols, much faster than by use of current molecular techniques. The immunobead assay can be run in parallel to routine immunophenotyping and is particularly attractive for clinical settings without direct access to molecular diagnostics.((PMID:21120205))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis can provide important information in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies. However, FISH performed in addition to G-banded karyotype can be labor-intensive and expensive. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH gives additional information in the setting of adequate conventional cytogenetics in cases of hematologic malignancies.Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from 135 patients at diagnosis (56 AML, 32 MDS, 20 ALL, and 27 MM) between 2005 and 2010. Interphase FISH was performed using the following probes: BCR/ABL1, AML1/ETO, PML/RARA, CBFB, MLL, EGR1, CEP8, and D7S486 for AML; CEP8, D20S108, EGR1, and D7S486 for MDS; BCR/ABL1, MLL, CDKN2A (p16), ETV6, and 6q21/c-myc for ALL; IgH, TP53, D13S25, IgH/CCND1, IgH/MAF, IgH/FGFR3, and 1q21/8p21 for MM. We compared the results of FISH with the corresponding aberrations identified by G-banded karyotype.Additional genetic aberrations detected by FISH (which were not identified by G-banded karyotype) were 4%, 9%, 50%, and 67% in AML, MDS, ALL, and MM, respectively. In ALL, CDKN2A and ETV6 FISH revealed additional genetic aberrations in 33% and 28% of cases, respectively. In MM, FISH was of benefit in detecting IgH, D13S25, TP53, and 1q21 rearrangements, not detected by G-banded karyotype (31%, 36%, 20%, and 40%, respectively).These results suggest that performing FISH in addition to G-banded karyotype may contribute little additional genetic information in AML and MDS, whereas routine FISH analysis appears to be an efficient screening method in ALL and MM.((PMID:20931398))MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are postulated to be important regulators in various cancers, including leukemia. In a large-scale miRNA expression profiling analysis of 435 human miRNAs in 52 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, we found that miR-126 and its minor counterpart in biogenesis, namely, miR-126*, were specifically aberrantly overexpressed in core binding factor (CBF) AMLs including both t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and inv(16)/CBFB-MYH11 samples. Our in vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that forced expression of miR-126 inhibited apoptosis and increased the viability of AML cells, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous expression of miR-126 was knocked down. In addition, through in vitro colony-forming/replating assays, we demonstrated that forced expression of miR-126 enhanced proliferation and colony-forming/replating capacity of mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells alone and particularly, in cooperation with AML1-ETO, a fusion gene resulting from t(8;21). Thus, our data shows that miR-126 may play a critical role in the development of CBF leukemias. In the present chapter, the materials and protocols for the study of miR-126 in leukemia are described.((PMID:20808941))Aberrant promoter DNA methylation has been shown to play a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathophysiology. However, further studies to discuss the prognostic value and the relationship of the epigenetic signatures with defined genomic rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia are required.We carried out high-throughput methylation profiling on 116 de novo AML cases and we validated the significant biomarkers in an independent cohort of 244 AML cases. Methylation signatures were associated with the presence of a specific cytogenetic status. In normal karyotype cases, aberrant methylation of the promoter of DBC1 was validated as a predictor of the disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, DBC1 expression was significantly silenced in the aberrantly methylated samples. Patients with chromosome rearrangements showed distinct methylation signatures. To establish the role of fusion proteins in the epigenetic profiles, 20 additional samples of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced with common fusion genes were studied and compared with patient samples carrying the same rearrangements. The presence of MLL rearrangements in HSPC induced the methylation profile observed in the MLL-positive primary samples. In contrast, fusion genes such as AML1/ETO or CBFB/MYH11 failed to reproduce the epigenetic signature observed in the patients.Our study provides a comprehensive epigenetic profiling of AML, identifies new clinical markers for cases with a normal karyotype, and reveals relevant biological information related to the role of fusion proteins on the methylation signature.((PMID:15156186))Inv(16)(p13q22) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia subtype M4Eo that is characterized by the presence of myelomonocytic blasts and atypical eosinophils. This chromosomal rearrangement results in the fusion of CBFB and MYH11 genes. CBF beta normally interacts with RUNX1 to form a transcriptionally active nuclear complex. The MYH11 gene encodes the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The CBF beta-SMMHC fusion protein is capable of binding to RUNX1 and form dimers and multimers through its myosin tail. Previous results from transgenic mouse models show that Cbfb-MYH11 is able to inhibit dominantly Runx1 function in hematopoiesis, and is a key player in the pathogenesis of leukemia. In recent years, molecular and cellular biological studies have led to the proposal of several models to explain the function of CBF beta-SMMHC. In this review, we will first focus our attention on the molecular mechanisms proposed in the recent publications. We will next examine recent gene expression profiling studies on inv(16) leukemia cells. Finally, we will describe a recent study from one of our labs on the identification of cooperating genes for leukemogenesis with CBFB-MYH11.((PMID:12434152))Core-binding factor beta (CBFbeta, also called polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2beta (PEBP2B)) is associated with an inversion of chromosome 16 and is associated with acute myeloid leukemia in humans. CBFbeta forms a heterodimer with RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1), which has a DNA binding domain homologous to the pair-rule protein runt in Drosophila melanogaster. Both RUNX1 and CBFbeta are essential for hematopoiesis. Haploinsufficiency of another runt-related protein, RUNX2 (also called CBFA1), causes cleidocranial dysplasia in humans and is essential in skeletal development by regulating osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation. Mice deficient in Cbfb (Cbfb(-/-)) die at midgestation, so the function of Cbfbeta in skeletal development has yet to be ascertained. To investigate this issue, we rescued hematopoiesis of Cbfb(-/-) mice by introducing Cbfb using the Gata1 promoter. The rescued Cbfb(-/-) mice recapitulated fetal liver hematopoiesis in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and survived until birth, but showed severely delayed bone formation. Although mesenchymal cells differentiated into immature osteoblasts, intramembranous bones were poorly formed. The maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic cells was markedly delayed, and no endochondral bones were formed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter assays showed that Cbfbeta was necessary for the efficient DNA binding of Runx2 and for Runx2-dependent transcriptional activation. These findings indicate that Cbfbeta is required for the function of Runx2 in skeletal development.((PMID:23997091))AML1/RUNX1 is an essential transcription factor involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. AML1 binds to the Runt-binding double-stranded DNA element (RDE) of target genes through its N-terminal Runt domain. In a previous study, we obtained RNA aptamers against the AML1 Runt domain by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment and revealed that RNA aptamers exhibit higher affinity for the Runt domain than that for RDE and possess the 5'-GCGMGNN-3' and 5'-N'N'CCAC-3' conserved motif (M: A or C; N and N' form Watson-Crick base pairs) that is important for Runt domain binding. In this study, to understand the structural basis of recognition of the Runt domain by the aptamer motif, the solution structure of a 22-mer RNA was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance. The motif contains the AH(+)-C mismatch and base triple and adopts an unusual backbone structure. Structural analysis of the aptamer motif indicated that the aptamer binds to the Runt domain by mimicking the RDE sequence and structure. Our data should enhance the understanding of the structural basis of DNA mimicry by RNA molecules.((PMID:20484411))Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and muscle segment homeobox homolog 2-interacting nuclear target (MINT) (Spen homolog) are transcriptional regulators critical for mammalian development. MINT enhances Runx2 activation of osteocalcin (OC) fibroblast growth factor (FGF) response element in an FGF2-dependent fashion in C3H10T1/2 cells. Although the MINT N-terminal RNA recognition motif domain contributes, the muscle segment homeobox homolog 2-interacting domain is sufficient for Runx2 activation. Intriguingly, Runx1 cannot replace Runx2 in this assay. To better understand this Runx2 signaling cascade, we performed structure-function analysis of the Runx2-MINT trans-activation relationship. Systematic truncation and domain swapping in Runx1:Runx2 chimeras identified that the unique Runx2 activation domain 3 (AD3), encompassed by residues 316-421, conveys MINT+FGF2 trans-activation in transfection assays. Ala mutagenesis of Runx2 Ser/Thr residues identified that S301 and T326 in AD3 are necessary for full MINT+FGF2 trans-activation. Conversely, phosphomimetic Asp substitution of these AD3 Ser/Thr residues enhanced activation by MINT. Adjacent Pro residues implicated regulation by a proline-directed protein kinase (PDPK). Systematic screening with PDPK inhibitors identified that the casein kinase-2/homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HIPK)/dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase inhibitor 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT), but not ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38MAPK, or other casein kinase-2 inhibitors, abrogated Runx2-, MINT-, and FGF2-activation. Systematic small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of DMAT-inhibited PDPKs revealed that HIPK3 depletion reduced MINT+FGF2-dependent activation of Runx2. HIPK3 and Runx2 coprecipitate after in vitro transcription-translation, and recombinant HIPK3 recognizes Runx2 AD3 as kinase substrate. Furthermore, DMAT treatment and HIPK3 RNAi inhibited MINT+FGF2 activation of Runx2 AD3, and nuclear HIPK3 colocalized with MINT. HIPK3 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide selectively reduced Runx2 protein accumulation and OC gene expression in C3H10T1/2 cells. Thus, HIPK3 participates in MINT+FGF2 regulation of Runx2 AD3 activity and controls Runx2-dependent OC expression.((PMID:15944284))Expression of the IL-7R alpha-chain (IL-7Ralpha) is strictly regulated during the development and maturation of lymphocytes. Glucocorticoids (GC) have pleiotypic effects on the growth and function of lymphocytes. Although GC have been reported to induce the transcription of IL-7Ralpha gene in human T cells, its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we show that GC up-regulate the levels of IL-7Ralpha mRNA and protein in mouse T cells. This effect does not require protein synthesis de novo, because protein synthesis inhibitors do not block the process. Mouse IL-7Ralpha promoter has striking homology with human and rat, containing consensus motifs of Ikaros, PU.1, and Runx1 transcription factors. In addition, a conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) of approximately 270 bp was found 3.6-kb upstream of the promoter, which was designated as CNS-1. A GC receptor (GR) motif is present in the CNS-1 region. Importantly, we show by reporter assay that the IL-7Ralpha promoter has specific transcription activity in T cells. This activity highly depends on the PU.1 motif. Furthermore, GC treatment augments the transcriptional activity through the GR motif in the CNS-1 region. We also demonstrate that GR binds to the GR motif by EMSA. In addition, by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that GR is rapidly recruited to endogenous CNS-1 chromatin after GC stimulation. These results demonstrate that GR binds to the GR motif in the CNS-1 region after GC stimulation and then activates the transcription of the IL-7Ralpha promoter. Thus, this study identifies the IL-7Ralpha CNS-1 region as a GC-responsive element.((PMID:11733147))The RUNX3 gene belongs to the runt domain family of transcription factors that act as master regulators of gene expression in major developmental pathways. In mammals the family includes three genes, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3. Here, we describe a comparative analysis of the human chromosome 1p36.1 encoded RUNX3 and mouse chromosome 4 encoded Runx3 genomic regions. The analysis revealed high similarities between the two genes in the overall size and organization and showed that RUNX3/Runx3 is the smallest in the family, but nevertheless exhibits all the structural elements characterizing the RUNX family. It also revealed that RUNX3/Runx3 bears a high content of the ancient mammalian repeat MIR. Together, these data delineate RUNX3/Runx3 as the evolutionary founder of the mammalian RUNX family. Detailed sequence analysis placed the two genes at a GC-rich H3 isochore with a sharp transition of GC content between the gene sequence and the downstream intergenic region. Two large conserved CpG islands were found within both genes, one around exon 2 and the other at the beginning of exon 6. RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3 gene products bind to the same DNA motif, hence their temporal and spatial expression during development should be tightly regulated. Structure/function analysis showed that two promoter regions, designated P1 and P2, regulate RUNX3 expression in a cell type-specific manner. Transfection experiments demonstrated that both promoters were highly active in the GM1500 B-cell line, which endogenously expresses RUNX3, but were inactive in the K562 myeloid cell line, which does not express RUNX3.((PMID:17914110))Selection of novel molecular markers is an important goal of cancer genomics studies. The aim of our analysis was to apply the multivariate bioinformatical tools to rank the genes - potential markers of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) according to their diagnostic usefulness. We also assessed the accuracy of benign/malignant classification, based on gene expression profiling, for PTC. We analyzed a 180-array dataset (90 HG-U95A and 90 HG-U133A oligonucleotide arrays), which included a collection of 57 PTCs, 61 benign thyroid tumors, and 62 apparently normal tissues. Gene selection was carried out by the support vector machines method with bootstrapping, which allowed us 1) ranking the genes that were most important for classification quality and appeared most frequently in the classifiers (bootstrap-based feature ranking, BBFR); 2) ranking the samples, and thus detecting cases that were most difficult to classify (bootstrap-based outlier detection). The accuracy of PTC diagnosis was 98.5% for a 20-gene classifier, its 95% confidence interval (CI) was 95.9-100%, with the lower limit of CI exceeding 95% already for five genes. Only 5 of 180 samples (2.8%) were misclassified in more than 10% of bootstrap iterations. We specified 43 genes which are most suitable as molecular markers of PTC, among them some well-known PTC markers (MET, fibronectin 1, dipeptidylpeptidase 4, or adenosine A1 receptor) and potential new ones (UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, cadherin 16, gap junction protein 3, sushi, nidogen, and EGF-like domains 1, inhibitor of DNA binding 3, RUNX1, leiomodin 1, F-box protein 9, and tripartite motif-containing 58). The highest ranking gene, metallophosphoesterase domain-containing protein 2, achieved 96.7% of the maximum BBFR score.((PMID:27689744))FAXDC2 (fatty acid hydroxylase domain containing 2) is a member of the fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily. Given the important role of fatty acids in megakaryocytes, we have studied the role of this gene in the development of this lineage. Here we show that the expression of FAXDC2 is constantly elevated during megakaryocyte maturation. In contrast, FAXDC2 is significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Moreover, FAXDC2 overexpression promotes the differentiation of megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells, whereas its knockdown disrupts their maturation. Mechanism study shows that FAXDC2 overexpression enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and increases RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1) expression. FAXDC2 also restores megakaryocytic differentiation in cells exposed to an ERK inhibitor or those expressing a dominant negative form of RUNX1. Finally, FAXDC2 overexpression leads to an increase in sphingolipid GM3 synthase, suggesting a potential role of FAXDC2 in lipid metabolism that increases ERK signaling and facilitates megakaryocyte differentiation. Together, these results show that FAXDC2 plays a novel role in development of megakaryocytes and its dysregulation may contribute to abnormal hematopoietic cell development in leukemia.((PMID:27683100))The National Pediatric Oncology Unit (UNOP) is the only pediatric hemato-oncology center in Guatemala.Patients ages 1 to 17 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated according to modified ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (IC-BFM) 2002 protocol. Risk classification was based on age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype, genetics (when available), and early response to therapy.From July 2007 to June 2014, 787 patients were treated, including 160 who had standard-risk ALL, 450 who had intermediate-risk ALL, and 177 who had high-risk ALL. The induction death rate was 6.6%, and the remission rate was 92.9%. The rates of death and treatment abandonment during first complete remission were 4.8% and 2.5%, respectively. At a median observation time of 3.6 years, and with abandonment considered an event, the 5-year event-free survival and overall survival estimates ( ± standard error) were 56.2% ± 2.1% and 64.1% ± 2.1%, respectively, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 28.9% ± 2.0%. Twenty-one of 281 patients (7.5%) investigated were positive for the ets variant 6/runt-related transcription factor 1 (ETV6/RUNX1) fusion.A well organized center in a low-middle-income country can overcome the disadvantages of malnutrition and reduce abandonment. Outcomes remain suboptimal because of late diagnosis, early death, and a high relapse rate, which may have a partly genetic basis. Earlier diagnosis, better management of complications, and better knowledge of ALL will improve outcomes.

Transcripts of muscle-specific kinase (21-fold), acetylcholine receptor subunits α (68-fold), ε (threefold) and γ (47-fold), neural cell adhesion molecule (66-fold), and runt-related transcription factor 1 (33-fold) were upregulated in VO muscle of the rat, consistent with the marked persistent denervation evidenced by a large proportion of very small fibers (>20 %). In the Sarco mice, there were much smaller increases in denervation transcripts (0-3.5-fold) and accumulation of very small fibers (2-6 %) compared to the VO rat, suggesting a reduced capacity for reinnervation in aging muscle. Despite the marked persistent denervation in the VO rat muscle, transcripts of neurotrophins involved in promoting axonal sprouting following denervation exhibited no increase, and several miRNAs predicted to suppress neurotrophins were elevated in VO rat.Our results support the hypothesis that the accumulation of denervated fibers with aging is due to failed reinnervation and that this may be affected by a limited neurotrophin response that mediates axonal sprouting following denervation.((PMID:27573239))An appropriate inflammatory response plays critical roles in eliminating pathogens, whereas an excessive inflammatory response can cause tissue damage. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, plays critical roles in T cells; however, its roles in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammation in macrophages are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that upon TLR4 ligand stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages reduced the expression levels of RUNX1. Silencing of RUNX1 attenuated the LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-6 production levels, but the TNF-α levels were not affected. Overexpression of RUNX1 promoted IL-1β and IL-6 production in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-κB luciferase activity. Importantly, treatment with the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, protected mice from LPS-induced endotoxic shock and substantially reduced the IL-6 levels. These findings suggest that RUNX1 may be a new potential target for resolving TLR4-associated uncontrolled inflammation and preventing sepsis.((PMID:27492765))In our previous studies on the Iranian β-thalassemia (β-thal) patients, we identified an association between the severity of the β-thal phenotype and the polymorphic palindromic site at the 5' hypersensitive site 4-locus control region (5'HS4-LCR) of the β-globin gene cluster. Furthermore, a linkage disequilibrium was observed between this region and XmnI-HBG2 in the patient population. Based on this data, it was suggested that the well-recognized phenotype-ameliorating role assigned to positive XmnI could be associated with its linked elements in the LCR. To investigate the functional significance of polymorphisms at the 5'HS4-LCR, we studied its influence on binding of transcription factors. Web-based predictions of transcription factor binding revealed a binding site for runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), when the allele at the center of the palindrome (TGGGG(A/G)CCCCA) was A but not when it was G. Furthermore, electromobility shift assay (EMSA) presented evidence in support of allele-specific binding of RUNX1 to 5'HS4. Considering that RUNX1 is a well-known regulator of hematopoiesis, these preliminary data suggest the importance of further studies to confirm this interaction and consequently investigate its functional and phenotypical relevance. These studies could help us to understand the molecular mechanism behind the phenotype modifying role of the 5'HS4-LCR polymorphic palindromic region (rs16912979), which has been observed in previous studies.((PMID:27434586))Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs has recently been reported in tumorigenesis and plays a pivotal role in regulating malignant behavior of cancers. In this study, we confirmed that the long noncoding RNAs human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex P5 (HCP5) was up-regulated in glioma tissues as well as in U87 and U251 cells. Knockdown of HCP5 inhibited the malignant biological behavior of glioma cells by reducing proliferation, migration and invasion, and inducing apoptosis. HCP5 regulated the malignant behavior of glioma cells by binding to microRNA-139, which functions as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, knockdown of HCP5 down-regulated Runt-related transcription factor 1, a direct and functional downstream target of microRNA-139 that is involved in microRNA-139-mediated tumor-suppressive effects in glioma cells. Runt-related transcription factor 1 increased promoter activities and upregulated expression of the oncogenic gene astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Runt-related transcription factor 1 also increased the promoter activities and expression of HCP5, which showed a positive feedback loop in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the HCP5-microRNA-139- Runt-related transcription factor 1 feedback loop plays a pivotal role in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells, which may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating glioma.Molecular Therapy (2016); doi:10.1038/mt.2016.103.((PMID:27358895))Chromosomal abnormalities lead to the development of hematologic malignancies such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Known chromosomal changes causing MDS include deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1), and very rarely fusion genes involving RUNX1 at t(5;21)(q15;q22). We present a case of a 71-year-old female with MDS, refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1, with a combination of two cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically a concomitant translocation between chromosomes 5q15 and 21q22 and deletion of chromosome 5q13q33. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for RUNX1 (AML1), localized to 21q22, showed three FISH signals for RUNX1, consistent with rearrangement of RUNX1. Therapy was started with Lenalidomide leading to normal blood counts. Most significantly, repeat cytogenetics revealed normal karyotype and resolution of deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5 and a t(5;21). FISH negative for deletion 5q. The results altogether meet criteria for a complete cytogenetic remission (CR). We report a new case of t(5;21)(q15;q22) involving the RUNX1 gene and del(5)(q13q33) in a MDS patient, a combination of chromosomal abnormalities heretofore not reported in the literature. RUNX1 rearrangement is usually associated with an adverse prognosis in AML and MDS. Deletions of 5q are typically associated with poor prognosis in AML, however it is usually associated with a favorable prognosis in MDS. Our patient responded very well to Lenalidomide therapy with achievement of CR. Lenalidomide is approved for treatment of anemia in low and intermediate risk MDS with del (5q), however based on a search of literature it seems that RUNX1 mutations are also more prominent in patients who have responded to Lenalidomide therapy. MDS is a genomically unstable disease. Hence, it is conceivable that our patient started with a 5q minus syndrome and then acquired the second hit RUNX1 translocation leading to an accelerated phase of myeloid neoplasm or refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1. Hence, the temporal relationship between acquisition of del 5q and RUNX1 rearrangement may have influenced the clinical outcome and possibly response to therapy.((PMID:27358138))Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology. AAA is caused by segmental weakening of the aortic walls and progressive aortic dilation leading to the eventual rupture of the aorta, accompanied by intense inflammation. Additionally, studies have indicated a close relationship between the pathogenesis and progression of AAA and cellular immune responses in aneurysm wall tissue. The Runt-related genes (RUNX) encode multifunctional mediators of the of intracellular signal transduction pathways in vascular remodeling, endothelial function, immune response and inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of RUNX regulatory genes in AAA tissues and to assess the correlations between them. The study was performed on AAA wall-tissue samples obtained from patients with AAA during open aneurysm repair and normal aortic tissues collected from healthy organ donors. There are no proven clinical management strategies or pharmaco-therapeutics to prevent AAA progression once an AAA has been detected. Moreover, so far no biomarkers have been established to indicate the disease status of AAA. Hence, understanding the pathogenesis of AAA has recently become an increasing priority in basic and translational vascular research. We identified significantly higher mRNA and protein level of all of three Runt-related genes in aneurysmal aorta compared to a normal aorta. Increased expression of RUNX2 was demonstrated for the first time in abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue. Additionally, relationships between the activity of RUNX genes in the pathological tissue were identified. The results of elevated expression of RUNX genes and their relationships in the AAA tissues suggest the involvement of conserved Runt-related genes in the pathophysiology of AAA development.((PMID:27288310))Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, characterized by dysregulation of cellular immunity. Th17 and associated IL-17 were involved in the pathogenesis of ITP. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a member of the runt domain-containing family of transcription factors, is required for Th17 differentiation. Whether RUNX1 was involved in the pathogenesis of ITP remains poorly understood. In this study, 30 active ITP patients, 20 ITP in remission and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated to measure mRNA level of RUNX1 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) by quantitative real-time PCR and Th17 cells by flow cytometry. Meanwhile, plasma was extracted for measurement of IL-17 level by ELISA. Our results showed a significantly higher expression of RUNX1, RORγt, Th17 cells and plasma level of IL-17 in active ITP patients than that in healthy controls. No differences of expression of RUNX1, RORγt and Th17 cells were observed between remission patients and controls. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation of RUNX1 with RORγt was found in active ITP patients. In conclusion, RUNX1 was associated with the pathogenesis of ITP possibly through regulation of Th17 cell differentiation and therapeutically targeting it might be a novel approach in ITP treatment.((PMID:27267711))Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, is expressed in preosteoclasts. Previously we evaluated the bone phenotype of CD11b-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice and demonstrated enhanced osteoclasts and decreased bone mass in males. However, an assessment of the effects of Runx1 deletion in female osteoclast precursors was impossible with this model. Moreover, the role of Runx1 in myeloid cell differentiation into other lineages is unknown. Therefore, we generated LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice, which delete Runx1 equally (∼80% deletion) in myeloid precursor cells from both sexes and examined the capacity of these cells to differentiate into osteoclasts and phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells. Both female and male LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice had decreased trabecular bone mass (72% decrease in bone volume fraction) and increased osteoclast number (2-3 times) (P < .05) without alteration of osteoblast histomorphometric indices. We also demonstrated that loss of Runx1 in pluripotential myeloid precursors with LysM-Cre did not alter the number of myeloid precursor cells in bone marrow or their ability to differentiate into phagocytizing or antigen-presenting cells. This study demonstrates that abrogation of Runx1 in multipotential myeloid precursor cells significantly and specifically enhanced the ability of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand to stimulate osteoclast formation and fusion in female and male mice without affecting other myeloid cell fates. In turn, increased osteoclast activity in LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice likely contributed to a decrease in bone mass. These dramatic effects were not due to increased osteoclast precursors in the deleted mutants and argue that inhibition of Runx1 in multipotential myeloid precursor cells is important for osteoclast formation and function.((PMID:27164167))Cell fate of lower Müllerian duct epithelium (MDE), to become uterine or vaginal epithelium, is determined by the absence or presence of ΔNp63 expression, respectively. Previously, we showed that SMAD4 and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were independently required for MDE to express ΔNp63. Here, we report that vaginal mesenchyme directs vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE through paracrine activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-MAPK pathway. In the developing reproductive tract, FGF7 and FGF10 were enriched in vaginal mesenchyme, whereas FGF receptor 2IIIb was expressed in epithelia of both the uterus and vagina. When Fgfr2 was inactivated, vaginal MDE underwent uterine cell fate, and this differentiation defect was corrected by activation of MEK-ERK pathway. In vitro, FGF10 in combination with bone morphogenetic protein 4 and activin A (ActA) was sufficient to induce ΔNp63 in MDE, and ActA was essential for induction of RUNX1 through SMAD-independent pathways. Accordingly, inhibition of type 1 receptors for activin in neonatal mice induced uterine differentiation in vaginal epithelium by down-regulating RUNX1, whereas conditional deletion of Smad2 and Smad3 had no effect on vaginal epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE is induced by FGF7/10-MAPK, bone morphogenetic protein 4-SMAD, and ActA-RUNX1 pathway activities, and the disruption in any one of these pathways results in conversion from vaginal to uterine epithelial cell fate.((PMID:27150991))To explore the application of combined detection of fusion gene and BIOMED-2 standardized immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement system in diagnosis and treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Multiplex-PCR amplifications and RQ-PCR of RNA/DNA were performed using ALL fusion gene detection kit and BIOMED-2 primer. The Ig gene rearrangements were analyzed by using PCR fragment analysis system.Out of 251 children with B-ALL, 77 cases were TEL-AML1(+) , 28 cases were E2A-PBX1(+) , 10 cases were MLL-AF4(+) , 11 cases were BCR-ABL(+) , the total positive rate was 50.2%, 82.5% showed IgH VH-JH rearrangement, 53.4% showed IgK rearrangement. The positive rate of combined detection of fusion gene and gene rearrangement was 99%. E2A-PBX1(+) and MLL-AF4(+) with IgK(+) gene rearrangement group was compared with negative control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001 or P = 0.005); 105 ALL fusion gene positive cases had been detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) simultaneously, the accordance rate of fusion gene and FISH was more than 94%.The combined detection of ALL fusion gene and BIOMED-2 standardized clonality analysis system can improve the positive detected rate of B-ALL dramatically, and make the grouping of disease prognosis more accurately; this combined detection is a more faster and sensitive method than FISH.((PMID:27112265))Less than 50 patients with FPD/AML (OMIM 601309) have been reported as of today and there may an underestimation. The purpose of this study was to describe the natural history, the haematological features and the genotype-phenotype correlations of this entity in order to, first, screen it better and earlier, before leukaemia occurrence and secondly to optimize appropriate monitoring and treatment, in particular when familial stem cell transplantation is considered.We have investigated 41 carriers of RUNX1 alteration belonging to nine unrelated French families with FPD/AML and two syndromic patients, registered in the French network on rare platelet disorders from 2005 to 2015.Five missense, one non-sense, three frameshift mutations and two large deletions involving several genes including RUNX1 were evidenced. The history of familial leukaemia was suggestive of FPD/AML in seven pedigrees, whereas an autosomal dominant pattern of lifelong thrombocytopenia was the clinical presentation of two. Additional syndromic features characterized two large sporadic deletions. Bleeding tendency was mild and thrombocytopenia moderate (>50 x10(9)/L), with normal platelet volume. A functional platelet defect consistent with a δ-granule release defect was found in ten patients regardless of the type of RUNX1 alteration. The incidence of haematological malignancies was higher when the mutated RUNX1 allele was likely to cause a dominant negative effect (19/34) in comparison with loss of function alleles (3/9). A normal platelet count does not rule out the diagnosis of FPD/AML, since the platelet count was found normal for three mutated subjects, a feature that has a direct impact in the search for a related donor in case of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Platelet dysfunction suggestive of defective δ-granule release could be of values for the diagnosis of FPD/AML particularly when the clinical presentation is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size in the absence of familial malignancies. The genotype-phenotype correlations might be helpful in genetic counselling and appropriate optimal therapeutic management.((PMID:27054428))The study shows how the influence of titanium surfaces on human mesenchymal stem cells differentiates toward osteocytes lineage and how, after growth, on machined titanium disk or etched titanium disk, changes, in gene expression for RUNX1, CTNNB1, SP7, and DLX5.Genes were analyzed by means of quantitative real-time polimerase chain reaction. Osseo genic lineage differentiation was also tested by means of the catenin-β1 immunofluorescence, induced osteoblasts, which represented the internal control.The RUNX1 and SP7 expressions in the induced osteoblasts prove to be different, compared with cells cultured on metallic supports. Moreover, the levels of expression of the runt-related transcription factor 1 and the osterix appeared more down-regulated in cells that grew on a machined titanium surface. In the present experimental model, mRNA expression of DLX5 and CTNNB1 in human mesenchymal stem cells, cultured on each of the titanium surfaces, showed no differences, compared with osteoblast-induced cells. The immunofluorescence scores, for protein expression of beta-catenin in human mesenchymal stem cell treated cells, illustrates significantly improved results with the etched surface.Present results suggested that different titanium surfaces might induce some differences in terms of gene expression. The only gene analyzed, which proved significant differences between the 2 titanium supports, was SP7; however, the other 3 genes indicating the existence of differences between the 2 titanium groups.((PMID:27014980))To evaluate the safety and efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors T cells (CAR-T) in childhood acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).A relapsed B-ALL child after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was treated with CAR-T, and the related literatures were reviewed.An 11-year-old girl with TEL-AML1 fusion gene positive BALL who suffered a bone marrow relapse 28 months after remission from conventional chemotherapy. During the second remission, the patient received haploidentical allo-HSCT. She relapsed with detectable TEL-AML1 fusion gene even after chemotherapy and donor leukocyte infusions. She received an experimental donor-derived fourth generation CD19 CAR-T therapy. After infusion of 1 × 10(6)/kg CAR-T cells, she experienced only mild or moderate cytokine-release syndrome and the minimal residual disease turned negative. Then three maintenance of CAR-T cell infusions [(0.83-1.65)×10(6)/kg] was administered, and the disease-free survival had lasted for 10 months. However, the TEL-AML1 copies in her blood still increased and she died with leukemia relapse after additional CAR-T cell infusion.Treatment of relapsed B-ALL with the fourth generation CAR-T cells directed against CD19 was effective and safe. CAR-T therapy is a novel therapeutic approach that could be useful for patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL who have failed all other treatment options.((PMID:26994850))Homoharringtonine combined aclarubicin and cytarabine (HAA) has been demonstrated to achieve a high remission rate and provide a survival advantage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate whether HAA is an ideal induction regimen for t(8;21)AML, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 140 patients from the last 8 years in our center. When achieving complete remission (CR), the post-remission treatment was administered as a minimal residual disease-directed risk-stratification treatment protocol. The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was assessed by RT-qPCR. The last follow-up was conducted in October 2015. In total, thirty patients received an HAA regimen as the induction treatment. The CR rate after one cycle of the HAA regimen was 93.3% (28/30). One patient achieved partial remission, and one had no response. No patients died during induction treatment. The median fold decrease of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was 200 (1-358000), and 16.7% (5/30) patients achieved >3 log decrease after one cycle of the HAA regimen. The estimated 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 89.9% and 90.8%, respectively. We concluded that the HAA regimen is highly effective as the first course of induction therapy for t(8;21) AML, and this needs to be confirmed in a large population in the future.((PMID:26990877))A network of lineage-specific transcription factors and microRNAs tightly regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells along the distinct lineages. Deregulation of this regulatory network contributes to impaired lineage fidelity and leukemogenesis. We found that the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 controls the expression of certain microRNAs, of importance during erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation. In particular, we show that the erythorid miR144/451 cluster is epigenetically repressed by RUNX1 during megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion protein transcriptionally represses the miR144/451 pre-microRNA. Thus RUNX1/ETO contributes to increased expression of miR451 target genes and interferes with normal gene expression during differentiation. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of RUNX1/ETO in Kasumi1 cells and in RUNX1/ETO positive primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples leads to up-regulation of miR144/451. RUNX1 thus emerges as a key regulator of a microRNA network, driving differentiation at the megakaryocytic/erythroid branching point. The network is disturbed by the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion product.((PMID:26907657))RUNX1 (AML1) amplification in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has been associated with poor survival for unclear reasons. Our anecdotal experience suggests that children with B-ALL and RUNX1 amplification might be predisposed to thrombosis.We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with B-ALL treated from 2008 to 2014 at the North Carolina Children's Hospital. Patient demographics, cytogenetics, and diagnosis of thrombosis were extracted by blinded chart review. Analysis was performed examining the relationship between RUNX1 amplification and thrombosis.We identified 119 patients with B-ALL and a median age of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.9 to 8.6 y) at diagnosis. Four patients (3%) had RUNX1 amplification. The average number of RUNX1 copies among those with amplification was 5 (SD 0.81 [range, 4 to 6]). Eighteen thromboses were diagnosed within 6 months of starting treatment. These events were more likely among patients with RUNX1 amplification than in patients without amplification (75% vs. 13%; RR 5.75, 95% confidence interval, 2.75-12.01).RUNX1 amplification may predispose to early thrombotic events in children with B-ALL which could, in part, contribute to their poorer outcomes. Treatment implications, including possible prophylactic anticoagulation of patients with of RUNX1 amplification, justify larger studies to confirm these findings.((PMID:26901859))RUNX1 a member of the family of runt related transcription factors (RUNX), is essential for hematopoiesis. The expression of RUNX1 gene is controlled by two promoters; the distal P1 promoter and the proximal P2 promoter. Several isoforms of RUNX1 mRNA are generated through the use of both promoters and alternative splicing. These isoforms not only differs in their temporal expression pattern but also exhibit differences in tissue specificity. The RUNX1 isoforms derived from P2 are expressed in a variety of tissues, but expression of P1-derived isoform is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage. However, the control of hematopoietic-cell specific expression is poorly understood. Here we report regulation of P1-derived RUNX1 mRNA by RUNX1 protein. In silico analysis of P1 promoter revealed presence of two evolutionary conserved RUNX motifs, 0.6kb upstream of the transcription start site, and three RUNX motifs within 170bp of the 5'UTR. Transcriptional contribution of these RUNX motifs was studied in myeloid and T-cells. RUNX1 genomic fragment containing all sites show very low basal activity in both cell types. Mutation or deletion of RUNX motifs in the UTR enhances basal activity of the RUNX1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RUNX1 protein is recruited to these sites. Overexpression of RUNX1 in non-hematopoietic cells results in a dose dependent activation of the RUNX1 P1 promoter. We also demonstrate that RUNX1 protein regulates transcription of endogenous RUNX1 mRNA in T-cell. Finally we show that SCL transcription factor is recruited to regions containing RUNX motifs in the promoter and the UTR and regulates activity of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in vitro. Thus, multiple lines of evidence show that RUNX1 protein regulates its own gene transcription.((PMID:27698447))((PMID:27694501))((PMID:27673579))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with t(8;21) aberration often have favorable outcomes, however, relapse still occurs in 30%-40% patients, with only 50%-60% of patients with t(8;21) AML cured with regimens containing high-dose cytarabine (HD-Ara-C). To evaluate the effects of fludarabine and cytarabine (FA) consolidation therapy for t(8;21) AML patients, a prospective randomized study was performed. A total of 45 patients with t(8;21) AML after achieving complete remission (CR) were randomly assigned to receive four course consolidation with FA (n=23) or HD-Ara-C (n=22). Our study showed that at 36-months, relapse-free survival (RFS) was 81.73% in the FA arm and 50.73% in the HD-Ara-C arm (P=0.04), overall survival (OS) was 91.1% and 48.4% (P=0.01) in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively; whereas cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 18.27% and 47.39%, in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively (P=0.05). In our study, treatment with FA, MRD2 status (reduction ≥ 3-log) and absence of c-kit mutations were identified as independent prognostic factors for lower risk of relapse, improved RFS and OS. We also found RFS for patients without c-kit mutations was 100% in FA arm, and 57.8% in HD-Ara-C arm at 36 months (P=0.005); OS of both groups at 36 months was 100% and 51.4%, respectively (P=0.004), suggesting a benefit of consolidation therapy with FA for t(8;21) AML patients, especially, those without c-kit mutations (Clinicaltrials.org ID NCT# 02024308).

Runx genes regulate development and their products are transcription factors associated with cancer development. A Runx1 enhancer element, eR1 is a marker of hematopoietic stem cells. We studied expression from eR1 in stomach and the roles of gastric stem cells in gastric carcinogenesis in transgenic mice.We used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses to study expression of Runx1 in gastric tissues from C57BL/6 (control) mice. We then created mice that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or CreERT2 under the control of eR1 (eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-tdTomato, eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-EYFP mice). Gastric tissues were collected and lineage-tracing experiments were performed. Gastric organoids were cultured from eR1-CreERT2(5-2);Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice and immunofluorescence analyses were performed. We investigated the effects of expressing oncogenic mutations in stem cells under control of eR1 using eR1-CreERT2;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice; gastric tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence.Most proliferation occurred in the isthmus; 86% of proliferating cells were RUNX1 positive and 76% were MUC5AC positive. In eR1-EGFP mice, EGFP signals were mainly detected in the upper part of the gastric unit, and 83% of EGFP-positive cells were located in the isthmus/pit region. We found that eR1 marked undifferentiated stem cells in the isthmus and a smaller number of terminally differentiated chief cells at the base. eR1 also marked cells in the pyloric gland in the antrum. Lineage tracing experiments demonstrated that stem cells in the isthmus and antrum continuously gave rise to mature cells to maintain the gastric unit. eR1-positive cells in the isthmus and pyloric gland generated organoid cultures in vitro. In eR1-CreERT2;LSL-Kras G12D/+ mice, MUC5AC-positive cells rapidly differentiated from stem cells in the isthmus, resulting in distinct metaplastic lesions similar to that observed in human gastric atrophy.Using lineage tracing experiments in mice, we found that a Runx1 enhancer element, eR1, promotes its expression in the isthmus stem cells of stomach corpus as well; as pyloric gland in the antrum. We were able to use eR1 to express oncogenic mutations; in gastric stem cells, proving a new model for studies of gastric carcinogenesis.((PMID:27667480))Down syndrome (DS) is the most common birth defect in children. To investigate the mechanisms of DS, the present study analyzed the bisulfite‑sequencing (seq) data GSE42144, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. GSE42144 included DNA methylation data of three DS samples and three control samples, and RNA‑seq data of two DS samples and five control samples. The methylated sites in the bisulfite‑seq data were detected using Bismark and Bowtie2. The BiSeq tool was applied to determine differentially methylated regions and to identify adjacent genes. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, the functions of the abnormal demethylated genes were predicted by functional enrichment analyses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened using a paired t‑test. Furthermore, the interactions of the proteins encoded by selected genes were determined using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Cytoscape. A total of 74 CpG regions showed significant differential DNA methylation between the DS and normal samples. There were five abnormal demethylated DNA regions in chromosome 21. In the DS samples, a total of 43 adjacent genes were identified with demethylation in their promoter regions and one adjacent gene was identified with upregulated methylation in its promoter regions. In addition, 584 upregulated genes were identified, including 24 genes with transcriptional regulatory function. In particular, upregulated Runt‑related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was located on chromosome 21. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) was involved in neuronal differentiation and transcriptional suppression. In the PPI network, genes may be involved in DS by interacting with others, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2)‑early growth response (EGR)2 and NR4A2‑EGR3. Therefore, RUNX1, NR4A2, EGR2, EGR3 and ID4 may be key genes associated with the pathogenesis of DS.((PMID:27664585))The t(12;21)(p13;q22) with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion occurs in 25% of cases of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL); and is generally associated with favorable prognosis. However, 15-20% of the t(12;21)-positive cases are associated with high-risk disease due to for example slow early responses to therapy. It is well-known that development of overt leukemia in t(12;21)-positive ALL requires secondary chromosomal aberrations although the full spectrum of these cytogenetic alterations is yet unsettled, and also, how they may be associated with disease outcome. This report describes the case of an adolescent male with t(12;21)-positive ALL who displayed a G-banded karyotype initially interpreted as del(1)(p22p13) and del(15)(q15). The patient was treated according to NOPHO standard risk protocol at diagnosis, but had minimal residual disease (MRD) at 6,4% on day 29 as determined by flowcytometric immunophenotyping. Because of MRD level>0.1% he was then assigned as a high risk patient and received intensified chemotherapy accordingly. Further molecular cytogenetic studies and oligo-based aCGH (oaCGH) analysis characterized the acquired complex structural rearrangements on chromosomes 1 and 15, which can be described as der(1)del(1)(p13.1p31.1)t(1;15)(q42;q15) with concurrent deletions at 1q31.2-q31.3, 1q42.12-q43, and 15q15.1-q15.3. The unbalanced complex rearrangements have not been described previously. Extended locus-specific FISH analyses showed that the three deletions were on the same chromosome 1 homologue that was involved in the t(1;15), and that the deletion on chromosome 15 also was on the same chromosome 15 homologue as involved in the t(1;15). Together these findings show the great importance of the combined usage of molecular cytogenetic analyses and oaCGH analysis to enhance characterization of apparently simple G-banded karyotypes, and to provide a more complete spectrum of secondary chromosomal aberrations in high risk t(12;21)-positive BCP-ALLs.((PMID:27650541))Overwhelming evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their role in the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL, one of the most frequent subtypes of pediatric leukemia. First, we used primary leukemia patient samples to identify an ETV6/RUNX1 specific expression signature consisting of 596 lncRNA transcripts. Next, integration of this lncRNA signature with RNA sequencing of BCP-ALL cell lines and lncRNA profiling of an in vitro model system of ETV6/RUNX1 knockdown, revealed that lnc-NKX2-3-1, lnc-TIMM21-5, lnc-ASTN1-1 and lnc-RTN4R-1 are truly regulated by the oncogenic fusion protein. Moreover, sustained inactivation of lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cells caused profound changes in gene expression. All together, our study defined a unique lncRNA expression signature associated with ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL and identified lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 as lncRNAs that might be functionally implicated in the biology of this prevalent subtype of human leukemia.((PMID:27637333))Transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-family are essential for antigen-specific T cell activation and differentiation. Their cooperative DNA binding with other transcription factors, such as AP1-proteins (FOS, JUN, JUNB), FOXP3, IRFs and EGR1, dictate the gene regulatory action of NFATs. To identify as yet unknown interaction partners of NFAT, we purified biotin tagged NFATc1/αA, NFATc1/βC and NFATc2/C protein-complexes and analyzed their components by SILAC-based mass spectrometry. We revealed more than 170 NFAT associated proteins, half of which are involved in transcriptional regulation. Among them are known, as well as many unknown interaction partners of NFATc1 and NFATc2 in T cells, such as Raptor, CHEK1, CREB1, RUNX1, SATB1, Ikaros and Helios. The association of NFATc2 with several other transcription factors is DNA-dependent, indicating cooperative DNA binding. Moreover, our computational analysis discovered that binding motifs for RUNX and CREB1 are found preferentially in the direct vicinity of NFAT binding motifs and in a distinct orientation to them. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mTOR and CHEK1 kinase activity influence NFAT's transcriptional potency. Finally, our dataset of NFAT-associated proteins provides a good basis to further study NFAT's diverse functions and how these are modulated due to the interplay of multiple interaction partners.((PMID:27634876))While decades of research have identified molecular pathways inducing and promoting stages of prostate cancer malignancy, studies addressing dynamic changes of cancer-related regulatory factors in a prostate tumor progression model are limited. Using the TRAMP mouse model of human prostate cancer, we address mechanisms of deregulation for the cancer-associated transcription factors, Runx1 and Runx2 by identifying microRNAs with reciprocal expression changes at six time points during 33 weeks of tumorigenesis. We molecularly define transition stages from PIN lesions to hyperplasia/neoplasia and progression to adenocarcinoma by temporal changes in expression of human prostate cancer markers, including the androgen receptor and tumor suppressors, Nkx3.1 and PTEN. Concomitant activation of PTEN, AR, and Runx factors occurs at early stages. At late stages, PTEN and AR are downregulated, while Runx1 and Runx2 remain elevated. Loss of Runx-targeting microRNAs, miR-23b-5p, miR-139-5p, miR-205-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-382-5p, and miR-384-5p, contribute to aberrant Runx expression in prostate tumors. Our studies reveal a Runx/miRNA interaction axis centered on PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling. This regulatory network translates to mechanistic understanding of prostate tumorigenesis that can be developed for diagnosis and directed therapy.((PMID:27620872))Around 20-25 % of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias carry the ETV6-RUNX1 (E/R) fusion gene - a fusion of two central hematopoietic transcription factors, ETV6 (TEL) and RUNX1 (AML1). Despite its prevalence, the exact genomic targets of E/R have remained elusive. We evaluated gene loci and enhancers targeted by E/R genome-wide in precursor B acute leukemia cells using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). We show that expression of the E/R fusion leads to widespread repression of RUNX1-motif containing enhancers at its target gene loci. Moreover, multiple super-enhancers from CD19/CD20-lineage were repressed implicating a role in impediment of lineage commitment. In effect, the expression of several genes involved in B cell signaling and adhesion was downregulated, and the repression depended on the wild-type DNA-binding Runt domain of RUNX1. We also identified a number of E/R-regulated annotated and de novo noncoding genes. The results provide a comprehensive genome-wide mapping between E/R-regulated key regulatory elements and genes in precursor B cell leukemia that disrupt normal B lymphopoiesis.((PMID:27618722))Down syndrome (DS) is the leading genetic cause of mental retardation and is caused by a third copy of human chromosome 21. The different pathologies of DS involve many tissues with a distinct array of neural phenotypes. Here we characterize embryonic stem cell lines with DS (DS-ESCs), and focus on the neural aspects of the disease. Our results show that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from five independent DS-ESC lines display increased apoptosis and downregulation of forehead developmental genes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested RUNX1 as a key transcription regulator in DS-NPCs. Using genome editing we were able to disrupt all three copies of RUNX1 in DS-ESCs, leading to downregulation of several RUNX1 target developmental genes accompanied by reduced apoptosis and neuron migration. Our work sheds light on the role of RUNX1 and the importance of dosage balance in the development of neural phenotypes in DS.((PMID:27617577))Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its candidacy as a therapeutic target has been evaluated. Gal-3 is widely upregulated in tumors, and its expression is associated with the development and malignancy of PDAC. In the present study, we demonstrate that a polysaccharide, RN1, purified from the flower of Panax notoginseng binds to Gal-3 and suppresses its expression. In addition, RN1 markedly inhibits PDAC cells growth in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, RN1 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gal-3, thereby disrupting the interaction between Gal-3 and EGFR and downregulating extracellular-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and the transcription factor of Gal-3, Runx1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of Runx1 by RN1, suppresses Gal-3 expression and inactivates Gal-3-associated signaling pathways, including the EGFR/ERK/Runx1, BMP/smad/Id-3 and integrin/FAK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, RN1 can also bind to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2) and block the interaction between Gal-3 and the BMPRs. Thus, our results suggest that a novel Gal-3 inhibitor RN1 may be a potential candidate for human PDAC treatment via multiple targets and multiple signaling pathways.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.306.((PMID:27611867))Precursor-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling represents a crucial checkpoint at the pre-B cell stage. Aberrant pre-BCR signaling is considered as a key factor for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) development. BCP-ALL are believed to be arrested at the pre-BCR checkpoint independent of pre-BCR expression. However, the cellular stage at which BCP-ALL are arrested and whether this relates to expression of the pre-BCR components (IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1) is still unclear. Here, we show differential protein expression and copy number variation (CNV) patterns of the pre-BCR components in pediatric BCP-ALL. Moreover, analyzing six BCP-ALL data sets (n = 733), we demonstrate that TCF3-PBX1 ALL express high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1, and are arrested at the pre-B stage. By contrast, ETV6-RUNX1 ALL express low levels of IGHM or VPREB1, and are arrested at the pro-B stage. Irrespective of subtype, ALL with high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1 are arrested at the pre-B stage and correlate with good prognosis in high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL (n = 207). Our findings suggest that BCP-ALL are arrested at different cellular stages, which relates to the expression pattern of the pre-BCR components that could serve as prognostic markers for high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL patients.((PMID:27601546))The genetic basis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is heterogeneous, and various combinations of somatic mutations are associated with different clinical phenotypes and outcomes. Whether the genetic basis of MDS influences the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is unclear.We studied 401 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from MDS (MDS/AML). We used massively parallel sequencing to examine tumor samples collected before HSCT for somatic mutations in 34 recurrently mutated genes in myeloid neoplasms. We then analyzed the impact of mutations on the outcome of HSCT.Overall, 87% of patients carried one or more oncogenic mutations. Somatic mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 were independent predictors of relapse and overall survival after HSCT in both patients with MDS and patients with MDS/AML (P values ranging from .003 to .035). In patients with MDS/AML, gene ontology (ie, secondary-type AML carrying mutations in genes of RNA splicing machinery, TP53-mutated AML, or de novo AML) was an independent predictor of posttransplantation outcome (P = .013). The impact of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 mutations on posttransplantation survival was independent of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Combining somatic mutations and IPSS-R risk improved the ability to stratify patients by capturing more prognostic information at an individual level. Accounting for various combinations of IPSS-R risk and somatic mutations, the 5-year probability of survival after HSCT ranged from 0% to 73%.Somatic mutation in ASXL1, RUNX1, or TP53 is independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after allogeneic HSCT for patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Accounting for these genetic lesions may improve the prognostication precision in clinical practice and in designing clinical trials.((PMID:27599428))Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are not only a valuable resource for regenerative medicine, but also a promising tool for disease modeling and drug discovery. Patient-specific iPSCs harboring disease-specific mutations are extremely useful for investigating disease mechanisms and novel treatment approaches. In the field of hematology, attempts to establish iPSCs from tumor cells such as those of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were largely unsuccessful because proper reprogramming processes were hampered by their extensive genetic alterations. In contrast, congenital disorders caused by a single genetic mutation are ideal candidates for deriving iPSCs. We have been investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying leukemia and MDS by implementing iPSC technology. Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a high propensity for developing acute leukemia, which is caused by heterozygous mutation of RUNX1. We have successfully established iPSCs from three distinct FPD pedigrees and examined the responsible defect during hematopoietic development. This system will serve as a novel unprecedented platform for prospectively studying hematologic disorders using human cells.((PMID:27591551))A novel role for phenotypic transcription factors in very early differentiation was recently observed and merits further study to elucidate what role this precocious expression may have in development. The RUNX1 transcription factor exhibits selective and transient upregulation during early mesenchymal differentiation. In contrast to phenotype-associated transcriptional control of gene expression to establish and sustain hematopoietic/myeloid lineage identity, precocious expression of RUNX1 is functionally linked to control of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition that is obligatory for development. This early RUNX1 expression spike provides a paradigm for precocious expression of a phenotypic transcription factor that invites detailed mechanistic study to fully understand its biological importance.

We have previously shown that inactivation of Dnmt3a in hematopoietic cells results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in mice. Here we show that 12% of Dnmt3a-deficient mice develop CD8+ mature peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) and 29% of mice are affected by both diseases. 10% of Dnmt3a+/- mice develop lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in PTCL. DNA methylation was deregulated genome-wide with 10-fold more hypo- than hypermethylated promoters and enhancers, demonstrating that hypomethylation is a major event in the development of PTCL. Hypomethylated promoters were enriched for binding sites of transcription factors AML1, NF-κB and OCT1, implying the transcription factors potential involvement in Dnmt3a-associated methylation. Whereas 71 hypomethylated genes showed an increased expression in PTCL, only 3 hypermethylated genes were silenced, suggesting that cancer-specific hypomethylation has broader effects on the transcriptome of cancer cells than hypermethylation. Interestingly, transcriptomes of Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ lymphomas were largely conserved and significantly overlapped with those of human tumors. Importantly, we observed downregulation of tumor suppressor p53 in Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ lymphomas as well as in pre-tumor thymocytes from 9 months old but not 6 weeks old Dnmt3a+/- tumor-free mice, suggesting that p53 downregulation is chronologically an intermediate event in tumorigenesis. Decrease in p53 is likely an important event in tumorigenesis because its overexpression inhibited proliferation in mouse PTCL cell lines, suggesting that low levels of p53 are important for tumor maintenance. Altogether, our data link the haploinsufficient tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3a in the prevention of mouse mature CD8+ PTCL indirectly to a bona fide tumor suppressor of T cell malignancies p53.((PMID:27587249))To investigate frequency and clinical features of additional sex combs-like 2 (ASXL2) gene mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene and to analyze the relationship between ASXL2 gene mutation and c- kit gene mutation.Mutation analysis of exon 11 and 12 of ASXL2 gene in 59 de novo AML patients was performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The clinical features, survival curve and c-kit gene mutation in ASXL2 gene mutation positive and negative patients were compared.In a total of 59 AML patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene positive, 11.9% (7/59) patients harboured ASXL2 gene mutations. The hemoglobin levels of patients with mutated ASXL2 gene [56.2 (38.0- 72.0) g/L] were significantly lower than those with wild type ASXL2 [69.0(37.2-154.0) g/L] (P=0.038). Differences were not observed in white blood cell counts, platelet counts, the proportion of acidophilic cell, and the proportion of primitive cell in the marrow between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). None of all 59 patients suffered from liver, spleen, central nervous system metastases in both groups. Moreover, enlarged lymph nodes was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.859). Immunophenotypic analysis: in positive group CD33 positive expression was significantly lower than that of negative group (P=0.033). cCD3 was not expressed in both groups. Expression levels of CD117, cMPO, HLA-DR, CD34, CD38, CD13, CD44, CD15, CD64, CD11b, CD56, CD19, cCD79a and CD7 were similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). All of 59 patients were in remission (P=0.577). Overall survival was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.631). The mutation rates of c- kit in positive group and negative group were 14.3% and 29.4%, without statistical significance (P= 0.697).ASXL2 mutation may be a new event that can cooperate with AML1-ETO to induce leukemia. Patients in AML1- ETO positive AML with ASXL2 mutation show specific clinical characteristics of hemoglobin levels and expression level of CD33. ASXL2 gene mutations and c-kit gene mutations may not have a specific correlation between them.((PMID:27576335))Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) sequences make up ~8% of the human genome and increased expression of some HERV proteins has been observed in various pathologies including leukaemia and multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the function of these HERV proteins or environmental factors which regulate their expression. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used very extensively as antimicrobials and antivirals in numerous consumer products although their effect on the expression of HERV gene products is unknown. Cell proliferation and cell toxicity assays were carried out on human acute T lymphoblastic leukaemia (MOLT-4) and Fanconi anaemia associated acute myeloid leukaemia (FA-AML1) cells treated with two different sizes of AgNPs (7nm and 50nm diameter). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were then used to the assess expression of HERV-W syncytin-1 mRNA and protein in these cells. FA-AML1 cells were more sensitive overall than MOLT-4 to treatment with the smaller 7nm sized AgNp's being the most toxic in these cells. MOLT-4 cell were more resistant and showed no evidence of differential toxicity to the different sized particles. Syncytin-1 mRNA and protein were induced by both 7 and 50nm AgNPs in both cell types yet with different kinetics. In summary, the observation that AgNPs induce expression of syncytin-1 in FA-AML1 and MOLT-4 cells at doses as little as 5 µg/ml is grounds for concern since this protein is up-regulated in both malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the widespread use of AgNPs in the environment it is clear that their ability to induce syncytin-1 should be investigated further in other cell types.((PMID:27554046))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) critically regulate gene expression by determining the acetylation status of histones. In addition, studies have increasingly focused on the activities of HDACs, especially involving non-histone proteins, and their various biological effects. Aberrant HDAC expression observed in several kinds of human tumors makes HDACs potential targets for cancer treatment. Several preclinical studies have suggested that HDAC inhibitors exhibit some efficacy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with AML1-ETO, which mediates transcriptional repression through its interaction with a complex including HDAC1. Recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators are found in T-cell lymphomas (TCLs), and HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents were shown to act cooperatively in the treatment of TCLs. Preclinical modeling has suggested that persistent activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway could serve as a useful biomarker of resistance to HDAC inhibitor in patients with cutaneous TCL. Panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, has achieved longer progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) than the placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Panobinostat inhibited MM cell growth by degrading protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit α (PPP3CA), a catalytic subunit of calcineurin. This degradation was suggested to be mediated by the blockade of the chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) due to HDAC6 inhibition. Aberrant PPP3CA expression in advanced MM indicated a possible correlation between high PPP3CA expression and the pathogenesis of MM. Furthermore, PPP3CA was suggested as a common target of panobinostat and bortezomib. This article is protected by copyright.

A frequent concomitant event is the loss of the residual ETV6 allele suggesting a critical role for the ETV6 transcriptional repressor in the etiology of this cancer. However, the precise mechanism through which loss of functional ETV6 contributes to disease pathogenesis is still unclear. To investigate the impact of ETV6 loss on the transcriptional network and to identify new transcriptional targets of ETV6, we used whole transcriptome analysis of both pre-B leukemic cell lines and patients combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using this integrative approach, we identified 4 novel direct ETV6 target genes: CLIC5, BIRC7, ANGPTL2 and WBP1L. To further evaluate the role of chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC5 in leukemogenesis, we generated cell lines overexpressing CLIC5 and demonstrated an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. We further described the implications of CLIC5's ion channel activity in lysosomal-mediated cell death, possibly by modulating the function of transferrin receptor with which it co-localizes intracellularly. For the first time, we showed that loss of ETV6 leads to significant overexpression of CLIC5, which in turn leads to decreased lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that heightened CLIC5 activity could promote a permissive environment for oxidative-stress induced DNA damage accumulation and thereby contribute to leukemogenesis.((PMID:27531762))To analyse the clinical features and prognostic significance of cross-lineage antigen expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML) in order to establish individualized treatment for a better outcome and prognosis.A total of 227 cases (exduding M3) were detected by flow cytometry for immune phenotype. The CD7(-)CD56(-)CD19(-) AML served as control. The clinical features, treatment response and prognosis of CD7(+) group, CD56(+) group and CD19(+) group were compared.The detection rate of CD56(+),CD7(+) and CD19(+) in AML was 15.9%, 25.1% and 11.0%, respectively. There were no differences between CD56(+) AML, CD7(+) AML, CD19(+) AML, and CD56(-)CD7(-)CD19(-) AML in the proportion of blast cells, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count and MDS transformed AML rate. The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD56(+) AML patients were lower than those in the control group (20.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.0099; 73.3% vs 87.5%, P=0.04). The median time of CR in CD56(+) AML was longer than that in the control group (118 days vs 46 days, P=0.04). The PFS time and OS time of CD56(+) AML were shorter than those in the control group (245 days vs 580 days, P=0.037; 494 days vs 809 days, P=0.04). The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD19(+) AML patients were higher than those in the control group(75.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.46; 100% vs 87.5%, P=0.02). The median time of CR in CD19(+) AML was shorter than that in the control group (28 days vs 46 days, P=0.02). The PFS time and OS time of CD19(+) AML tended to be longer than those in the control group (P=0.13, P=0.07, respectively). The median PFS and OS were not reached at the time of last follow-up. The CR after the first course chemotherapy, cumulative CR and median time to CR in CD7(+) AML patients were not different from those in the control group (53.1% vs 58.1%, P=0.67; 87.1% vs 87.5%, P=0.44; 50 days vs 46 days, P=0.44). No differences of PFS and OS were observed between CD7(+) AML and the control.CD56(+) AML patients respond poorly to treatment, frequently relapse after complete remission and have a low survival rate. These patients need more intensive chemotherapy or in combination with other treatments. The interval of MRD detection should be shortened to find out relapse earlier. CD19(+) AML patients have a good treatment outcome and often accompanies with AML1/ETO fusion gene, which is known to be a good prognostic marker. Aberrant expression of CD7 on AML cells is not a poor prognostic factor in this study.((PMID:27512117))Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) carrying t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) is classified as core binding factor (CBF)-AML and accounts for approximately 15% of AML. c-KIT mutation can be detected in 17%∼46% of CBF-AML and is associated with poor prognosis. c-KIT mutation is a crucial hit and cooperates with AML1-ETO resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) to cause overt AML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting c-KIT, such as imatinib, has been used successfully to treat c-KIT driven gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, the effect of TKI on c-KIT-driven leukemia, including CBF-AML and systemic mastocytosis (SM), has not been satisfactory. BPR1J373 is a 5-phenylthiazol-2-ylamine-pyriminide derivative targeting multiple tyrosine kinases. It was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells with constitutively activated c-KIT via inhibiting c-KIT phosphorylation and its downstream signals. The compound induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway through upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak and caspase 8 and 9 activation in c-KIT mutant Kasumi-1 cells. Furthermore, it induced cell-cycle arrest via targeting aurora kinase B in c-KIT wild-type KG-1 cells. The antitumor response of BPR1J373 was also shown in subcutaneously grafted SCID mice. BPR1J373 was shown to effectively suppress c-KIT phosphorylation of D816V mutation by treating c-KIT-null COS-1 cells transfected with c-KIT D816V mutant plasmid. In conclusion, BPR1J373 inhibits cell proliferation of c-KIT-driven AML cells via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. It is also effective for multiple drug-resistant c-KIT D816V mutation. BPR1J373 deserves further development for clinical use in c-KIT-driven myeloid leukemia.

Enabling replicative immortalization via telomerase reactivation is a crucial step in cancer development. However, AE expression alone is not sufficient to maintain high telomerase activity to immortalize human HSPC cells, which may hamper transformation. Here, we investigated the cooperativity of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, and AE in disease progression. Enforced expression of hTERT immortalized human AE pre-leukemia cells in a telomere-lengthening independent manner, and improved the pre-leukemia stem cell function by enhancing cell proliferation and survival. AE-hTERT cells retained cytokine dependency and multi-lineage differentiation potential similar to parental AE clones. Over the short-term, AE-hTERT cells did not show features of stepwise transformation, with no leukemogenecity evident upon initial injection into immunodeficient mice. Strikingly, after extended culture, we observed full transformation of one AE-hTERT clone, which recapitulated the disease evolution process in patients and emphasizes the importance of acquiring cooperating mutations in t(8;21) AML leukemogenesis. In summary, achieving unlimited proliferative potential via hTERT activation, and thereby allowing for acquisition of additional mutations, is a critical link for transition from pre-leukemia to overt disease in human cells. AE-hTERT cells represent a tractable model to study cooperating genetic lesions important for t(8;21) AML disease progression.((PMID:27486062))The presence of AML1-ETO (RUNX1-CBF2T1), a fusion oncoprotein resulting from a t(8;21) chromosomal translocation, has been implicated as a necessary but insufficient event in the development of a subset of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). While AML1-ETO prolongs survival and inhibits differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), other contributory events are needed for cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. We have postulated that specific tumor suppressor genes keep the leukemic potential of AML1-ETO in check. In studying del(9q), one of the most common concomitant chromosomal abnormalities with t(8;21), we identified the loss of an apparent tumor suppressor, TLE4, that appears to cooperate with AML1-ETO to confer a leukemic phenotype. This study sought to identify the molecular basis of this cooperation. We show that the loss of TLE4 confers proliferative advantage to leukemic cells, simultaneous with an upregulation of a pro- inflammatory signature mediated through aberrant increases in Wnt signaling activity. We further demonstrate that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity partly reverses the pro-leukemic phenotype due to TLE4 knockdown, pointing towards a novel therapeutic approach for myeloid leukemia.((PMID:27460334))It has been reported that amyloid precursor protein (APP) promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in various types of solid cancers. In our previous study, we showed that APP is highly expressed and regulates leukemia cell migration in AML1‑ETO-positive (AE) leukemia. Whether APP is involved in the regulation of AE leukemia cell proliferation or apoptosis is unclear. In the present study we focused on the correlation of APP with c-KIT mutation/overexpression and cell proliferation and apoptosis in AE leukemia. APP and c-KIT expression detected by quantitative real-time (qPCR) method, and c-KIT mutations screened using PCR in bone marrow cells from 65 patients with AE leukemia before their first chemotherapy, were simultaneously assessed. Furthermore, the Kasumi-1 cell line was chosen as the cell model, and the APP gene was knocked down using siRNA technology. The correlation of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis and c-Kit expression with APP expression levels, as well as the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by APP were analyzed in the Kasumi-1 cell line. The results showed that peripheral white blood cell counts (P=0.008) and bone marrow cellularity (P=0.031), but not bone marrow blasts, were correlated with APP expression. Moreover, the patients with APP high expression had a significantly higher incidence of c-KIT mutations (P<0.001) and increased levels of c-KIT expression (P=0.001) and poorer disease outcome. In the Kasumi-1 cell line, as compared with the wild-type and negative control cells, cell apoptosis, both early (P<0.001) and late (P<0.001), was significantly increased when the APP gene was knocked down, concomitant with reduced levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased levels of caspase-3 and -9, however, no apparent change was observed in the cell cycle distribution (P>0.05). Moreover, the knockdown of APP markedly decreased c-KIT expression at both the transcription (as evidenced by qPCR analysis) and translation (as confirmed by CD117 assay and western blot analysis) levels, as well as p-AKT and its downstream targets including NF-κB, p53 and Bcl-2. In conclusion, APP may cooperate with c-KIT mutation/overexpression in the regulation of cell apoptosis but not proliferation in AE leukemia via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.((PMID:27457952))Chromosomal translocation 8;21 is found in 40% of the FAB M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The resultant in-frame fusion protein AML1-ETO (AE) acts as an initiating oncogene for leukemia development. AE immortalizes human CD34(+) cord blood cells in long-term culture. We assessed the transforming properties of the alternatively spliced AE isoform AE9a (or alternative splicing at exon 9), which is fully transforming in a murine retroviral model, in human cord blood cells. Full activity was realized only upon increased fusion protein expression. This effect was recapitulated in the AE9a murine AML model. Cotransduction of AE and AE9a resulted in a strong selective pressure for AE-expressing cells. In the context of AE, AE9a did not show selection for increased expression, affirming observations of human t(8;21) patient samples where full-length AE is the dominant protein detected. Mechanistically, AE9a showed defective transcriptional regulation of AE target genes that was partially corrected at high expression. Together, these results bring an additional perspective to our understanding of AE function and highlight the contribution of oncogene expression level in t(8;21) experimental models.((PMID:27431573))MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. miRNAs act in diverse biological processes including development, cell growth, apoptosis, and hematopoiesis. The miRNA expression is associated with specific cytogenetic changes and can also be used to discriminate between the different subtypes of leukemia in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with common translocations, it is shown that the miRNAs have the potential to be used for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. We reviewed the roles of miRNA here with emphasis on their function in human leukemia and the mechanisms of the TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, MLL/AF4 and TCF3/PBX1 oncoproteins on miRNAs expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.((PMID:27418307))((PMID:27352183))Our objective is to explore the tumor-specific mutated genes by transcriptome sequencing of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. 96 patients with subtype M2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), admitted during January 2007 to January 2012, were selected. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from the patients after the first visit and the patients who were improved or alleviated, were subjected to high-throughput sequencing to compare the gene expression. The single nucleotide mutation related to subtype M2 AML was detected. Meanwhile, real-time fluorescent quantitation RT-PCR was used to detect the AML1/ETO fusion gene and its correlation with prognosis after treatment. Among 96 patients, AML1-ETO fusion gene was positive in 52 cases, the positive rate was 54.17 %. The complete relief (CR) rate of AML1-ETO fusion gene positive patients was 84.62 %, and the CR rate of AML1/ETO fusion gene negative patients was 77.27 %; the CR rate of AML1-ETO positive patients was higher than that of patients without the fusion gene, however there was no statistical difference. In the analysis of recurrent gene mutation in AML-M2 patients, IDH2, ASXL1, TET2, JAK1 and JAK2 gene expressions were not significantly different before treatment and after CR, however, IDHI, JAK3, ABL1 and BCR gene expressions were significantly different. In the study of transcriptome in AML-M2 patients, high-throughput sequencing could effectively detect the difference of the gene expression before treatment and after CR. Furthermore, positive expression of AML1-ETO fusion gene had effect on the prognosis of patients.((PMID:27346355))Homeobox genes are known to be key factors in leukemogenesis. Although the TALE family homeodomain factor Meis1 has been linked to malignancy, a role for MEIS2 is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that MEIS2 is expressed at high levels in patients with AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia and that growth of AML1-ETO-positive leukemia depends on MEIS2 expression. In mice, MEIS2 collaborates with AML1-ETO to induce acute myeloid leukemia. MEIS2 binds strongly to the Runt domain of AML1-ETO, indicating a direct interaction between these transcription factors. High expression of MEIS2 impairs repressive DNA binding of AML1-ETO, inducing increased expression of genes such as the druggable proto-oncogene YES1. Collectively, these data describe a pivotal role for MEIS2 in AML1-ETO-induced leukemia.((PMID:27276256))AML1-ETO is the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t (8;21)(q22;q22). It causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by dysregulating the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation and recently has been reported to bind multiple subunits of the mammalian cytosolic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT), primarily through its DNA binding domain (AML1-175). Through these interactions, TRiC plays an important role in the synthesis, folding, and activity of AML1-ETO. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we demonstrate here that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO's DNA-binding domain (AML1-175) forms a stable complex with apo-TRiC. Our structure reveals that AML1-175 associates directly with a specific subset of TRiC subunits in the open conformation.((PMID:27244239))Salicylate and acetylsalicylic acid are potent and widely used anti-inflammatory drugs. They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-κB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.((PMID:26209801))Prioritization of candidate genes emanating from large-scale screens requires integrated analyses at the genomics, molecular, network and structural biology levels. We have extended the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) to facilitate these tasks.

Case-specific information regarding flow cytometric, morphologic, and laboratory findings of this subtype of leukemia is currently lacking.We searched the databases of three large institutions for lymphoblastic leukemia with iAMP21 from 2005 through 2012 and analyzed the clinicopathologic features.We identified 17 cases with five or more RUNX1 signals on interphase nuclei, 14 of which were consistent with the Children's Oncology Group (COG) definition for iAMP21—namely, the presence of three or more RUNX1 signals on one marker chromosome. These cases showed a statistically significant lower peripheral WBC count and older age at diagnosis compared with all pediatric cases of B-ALL. We also identified three cases with increased RUNX1 signals scattered on multiple marker chromosomes that did not meet the COG definition of iAMP21 but showed similar 21q instability and older age at presentation.Our findings not only demonstrate that B-ALL with iAMP21 is truly a distinct clinicopathologic entity but also suggest that a subset of cases of B-ALL with iAMP21 can show variable cytogenetic features.((PMID:25760063))Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is a rare and aggressive type of cancer, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Identification of patients at high risk of TSCC tumorigenesis may provide information for the early detection of metastases, and for potential treatment strategies. MicroRNA (miRNA; miR) and mRNA expression profiling of TSCC tissue samples and normal control tissue samples were obtained from three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data series. Bioinformatics analyses, including the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were used to identify genes and pathways specifically associated with miRNA-associated TSCC oncology. A total of 25 miRNAs and 769 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the two groups assessed, and all the differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA target interactions were analyzed. The miRNA target genes were predominantly associated with 38 GO terms and 13 pathways. Of the genes differentially expressed between the two groups, and confirmed in another GEO series, miRNA-494, miRNA-96, miRNA-183, runt-related transcription factor 1, programmed cell death protein 4 and membrane-associated guanylate kinase were the most significantly altered, and may be central in the regulation of TSCC. Bioinformatics may be used to analyze large quantities of data in microarrays through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of complete data on TSCC. In the present study, a novel differential miRNA-mRNA expression network was constructed, and further investigation may provide novel targets for the diagnosis of TSCC.((PMID:25749719))The differentiation from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to mature and functional blood cells requires the finely tuned regulation of gene expression at each stage of development. Specific transcription factors play a key role in this process as they modulate the expression of their target genes in an exquisitely lineage-specific manner. A large number of important transcriptional regulators have been identified which establish and maintain specific gene expression patterns during hematopoietic development. Hematopoiesis is therefore a paradigm for investigating how transcription factors function in mammalian cells, thanks also to the evolution of genome-wide and the next-generation sequencing technologies. In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of the biological and functional properties of the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFA2, PEBP2aB) transcription factor and its main downstream target PU.1. We will outline their relationship in determining the fate of the myeloid lineage during normal stem cell development and under conditions when hematopoietic development is subverted by leukemic transformation.((PMID:25540605))Our understanding of the genetic factors underlying juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is growing, but remains incomplete. Recently, a number of novel genetic loci were reported to be associated with JIA at (or near) genome-wide significance in a large case-control discovery sample using the Immunochip genotyping array. However, independent replication of findings has yet to be performed. We therefore attempted to replicate these newly identified loci in the Australian CLARITY JIA case-control sample.Genotyping was successfully performed on a total of 404 JIA cases (mean age 6.4 years, 68% female) and 676 healthy child controls (mean age 7.1 years, 42% female) across 19 SNPs previously associated with JIA. We replicated a significant association (p < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) in a direction consistent with the previous report) for seven loci, six replicated for the first time--C5orf56-IRF1 (rs4705862), ERAP2-LNPEP (rs27290), PRR5L (rs4755450), RUNX1 (rs9979383), RUNX3 (rs4648881), and UBE2L3 (rs2266959).We have carried out the first independent replication of association for six genes implicated in JIA susceptibility. Our data significantly strengthens the evidence that these loci harbor true disease associated variants. Thus, this study makes an important contribution to the growing body of international data that is revealing the genetic risk landscape of JIA.((PMID:25449688))To clarify the prevalence and prognostic significance of c-KIT mutations in patients with core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML), a total of 351 patients who were categorized as pediatric t(8;21), adult t(8;21), pediatric inv(16), or adult inv(16) were screened at diagnosis for c-KIT mutations in exons 17 and 8 using direct sequencing. A total of 250 patients underwent follow-up. Overall, 36.5% of the patients had a c-KIT mutation. Adult t(8;21) and inv(16) patients had mutations predominantly in exons 17 and 8, respectively. Higher White blood cell (WBC) count, WBC index, and AML1-ETO transcript levels in adult t(8;21) patients were significantly associated with c-KIT mutations and mutations in exon 17 (P≤0.030). c-KIT mutations in adult t(8;21) patients were significantly correlated with a high cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, P=0.0070) at 2 years and a low 2-year disease-free survival (DFS, P=0.013) and overall survival (OS, P=0.0055). However, no significant difference was revealed in the effect of c-KIT mutations on outcome of adult inv(16) and pediatric t(8;21) patients (all P>0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that c-KIT mutation is an independent prognostic factor for relapse, DFS, and OS (P≤0.016) in adult t(8;21) AML patients. Therefore, with regard to c-KIT mutation, CBF-AML is a heterogeneous disease. c-KIT mutations have a strong adverse effect on the relapse and survival of adult t(8;21) AML patients.((PMID:25378323))Thousands of unique mutations in transcription factors (TFs) arise in cancers, and the functional and biological roles of relatively few of these have been characterized. Here, we used structure-based methods developed specifically for DNA-binding proteins to systematically predict the consequences of mutations in several TFs that are frequently mutated in cancers. The explicit consideration of protein-DNA interactions was crucial to explain the roles and prevalence of mutations in TP53 and RUNX1 in cancers, and resulted in a higher specificity of detection for known p53-regulated genes among genetic associations between TP53 genotypes and genome-wide expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas, compared to existing methods of mutation assessment. Biophysical predictions also indicated that the relative prevalence of TP53 missense mutations in cancer is proportional to their thermodynamic impacts on protein stability and DNA binding, which is consistent with the selection for the loss of p53 transcriptional function in cancers. Structure and thermodynamics-based predictions of the impacts of missense mutations that focus on specific molecular functions may be increasingly useful for the precise and large-scale inference of aberrant molecular phenotypes in cancer and other complex diseases.((PMID:25139854))Haematopoiesis in adult animals is maintained by haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which self-renew and can give rise to all blood cell lineages. The AGM region is an important intra-embryonic site of HSC development and a wealth of evidence indicates that HSCs emerge from the endothelium of the embryonic dorsal aorta and extra-embryonic large arteries. This, however, is a stepwise process that occurs through sequential upregulation of CD41 and CD45 followed by emergence of fully functional definitive HSCs. Although largely dispensable at later stages, the Runx1 transcription factor is crucially important during developmental maturation of HSCs; however, exact points of crucial involvement of Runx1 in this multi-step developmental maturation process remain unclear. Here, we have investigated requirements for Runx1 using a conditional reversible knockout strategy. We report that Runx1 deficiency does not preclude formation of VE-cad+CD45-CD41+ cells, which are phenotypically equivalent to precursors of definitive HSCs (pre-HSC Type I) but blocks transition to the subsequent CD45+ stage (pre-HSC Type II). These data emphasise that developmental progression of HSCs during a very short period of time is regulated by precise stage-specific molecular mechanisms.((PMID:24981862))A large gap exists in our understanding of the course of differentiation from mesoderm to definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Previously, we reported that Runx1(+) cells in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) embryos contribute to the hemogenic endothelium in the E10.5 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and HSCs in the adult bone marrow. Here, we show that two Runx1(+) populations subdivided by Gata1 expression exist in E7.5 embryos. The hemogenic endothelium and the HSCs are derived only from the Runx1(+)Gata1(-) population. A subset of this population moves from the extra- to intraembryonic region during E7.5-E8.0, where it contributes to the hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA). Migration occurs before the heartbeat is initiated, and it is independent of circulation. This suggests a developmental trajectory from Runx1(+) cells in the E7.5 extraembryonic region to definitive HSCs via the hemogenic endothelium.((PMID:24957142))Recent genomic studies have provided a refined genetic map of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and increased the number of potential prognostic markers. Therefore, we integrated copy-number alteration data from the 8 most commonly deleted genes, subordinately, with established chromosomal abnormalities to derive a 2-tier genetic classification. The classification was developed using 809 ALL97/99 patients and validated using 742 United Kingdom (UK)ALL2003 patients. Good-risk (GR) genetic features included ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, normal copy-number status for all 8 genes, isolated deletions affecting ETV6/PAX5/BTG1, and ETV6 deletions with a single additional deletion of BTG1/PAX5/CDKN2A/B. All other genetic features were classified as poor risk (PR). Three-quarters of UKALL2003 patients had a GR genetic profile and a significantly improved event-free survival (EFS) (94%) compared with patients with a PR genetic profile (79%). This difference was driven by a lower relapse rate (4% vs 17%), was seen across all patient subgroups, and was independent of other risk factors. Even genetic GR patients with minimal residual disease (>0.01%) at day 29 had an EFS in excess of 90%. In conclusion, the integration of genomic and cytogenetic data defines 2 subgroups with distinct responses to treatment and identifies a large subset of children suitable for treatment deintensification.((PMID:24648275))Little is known about childhood ALL in the Middle East. This study was undertaken by MECCA as initial efforts in collaborative data collection to provide clinical and demographic information on children with ALL in the Middle East.Clinical and laboratory data for patients with ALL between January 2008 and April 2012 were prospectively collected from institutions in 14 Middle East countries and entered into a custom-built-database during induction phase. All laboratory studies including cytogenetics were done at local institutions.The 1,171 voluntarily enrolled patients had a mean age of 6.1 ± 3.9 years and 59.2% were boys. T-ALL represented 14.8% and 84.2% had B-precursor ALL. At diagnosis, 5.6% had CNS disease. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities reflected a similar percentage of hyperdiploidy (25.6%), but a lower percentage of ETV6-RUNX1 translocation (14.7%) compared to large series reported from Western populations. By clinical criteria, 47.1% were low/standard risk, 16.9% were intermediate risk, and 36% were high risk. Most patients received all their care at the same unit (96.9%). Patients had excellent induction response to chemotherapy with an overall complete remission rate of 96%. Induction toxicities were acceptable.This first collaborative study has established a process for prospective data collection and future multinational collaborative research in the Middle East. Despite the limitations of an incomplete population-based study, it provides the first comprehensive baseline data on clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation, induction outcome, and toxicity. Further work is planned to uncover possible biologic differences of ALL in the region and to improve diagnosis and management.((PMID:24374719))TLS/FUS-ERG chimeric fusion transcript resulting from translocation changes involving chromosomes 16 and 21 is a rare genetic event associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The distinct t(16;21) AML subtype exhibits unique clinical and morphological features and is associated with poor prognosis and a high relapse rate; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. Recently, whole-genome sequencing revealed a large set of genetic alterations that may be relevant for the dynamic clonal evolution and relapse pathogenesis of AML. Here, we report three pediatric AML patients with t(16;21) (p11; q22). The TLS/FUS-ERG fusion transcript was detected in all diagnostic and relapsed samples, with the exception of one relapsed sample. We searched for several genetic lesions, such as RUNX1, FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TP53, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1/2, and DNMT3A, in primary and relapsed AML samples. Interestingly, we found RUNX1 mutation in relapsed sample of one patient in whom cytogenetic analysis showed the emergence of a new additional clone. Otherwise, there were no genetic alterations in FLT3, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TP53, CBL, ASXL1, IDH1/2, or DNMT3A. Our results suggest that precedent genetic alterations may be essential to drive the progression and relapse of t(16;21)-AML patients.((PMID:24316076))Mammalian pain-related sensory neurons are derived from TrkA lineage neurons located in the dorsal root ganglion. These neurons project to peripheral targets throughout the body, which can be divided into superficial and deep tissues. Here, we find that the transcription factor Runx1 is required for the development of many epidermis-projecting TrkA lineage neurons. Accordingly, knockout of Runx1 leads to the selective loss of sensory innervation to the epidermis, whereas deep tissue innervation and two types of deep tissue pain are unaffected. Within these cutaneous neurons, Runx1 suppresses a large molecular program normally associated with sensory neurons that innervate deep tissues, such as muscle and visceral organs. Ectopic expression of Runx1 in these deep sensory neurons causes a loss of this molecular program and marked deficits in deep tissue pain. Thus, this study provides insight into a genetic program controlling the segregation of cutaneous versus deep tissue pain pathways.((PMID:24240679))Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as chronic myelogenous (CML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML) are frequently induced by tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Although these MPNs are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, patients often relapse upon withdrawal of therapy. We used a model of MPN, which is induced by co-expression of the oncoproteins HIP1/PDGFβR (H/P) and AML1/ETO from their endogenous loci, to examine the mechanisms of disease development and recurrence following imatinib withdrawal. Although the MPN displayed a full hematologic response to imatinib, 100% of the diseased mice relapsed upon drug withdrawal. MPN persistence was not due to imatinib resistance mutations in the H/P oncogene or massive gene expression changes. Within 1 week of imatinib treatment, more than 98% of gene expression changes induced by the oncogenes in isolated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (lineage(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) immunophenotype) normalized. Supplementation of imatinib with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or arsenic trioxide reduced MPN-initiating cell frequencies and the combination of imatinib with arsenic trioxide cured a large fraction of mice with MPNs. In contrast, no mice in the imatinib-treated control cohorts were cured. These data suggest that treatment with a combination of arsenic trioxide and imatinib can eliminate refractory MPN-initiating cells and reduce disease relapse.((PMID:23715539))Hematopoiesis - the process by which blood cells are formed - has been studied intensely for over a century using a variety of model systems. There is conservation of the overall hematopoietic process between vertebrates, although some differences do exist. Over the last decade, the zebrafish has come to the forefront as a new model in hematopoiesis research, as it allows the use of large-scale genetics, chemical screens and transgenics. This comparative approach to understanding hematopoiesis has led to fundamental knowledge about the process and to the development of new therapies for disease. Here, we provide a broad overview of vertebrate hematopoiesis. We also highlight the benefits of using zebrafish as a model.((PMID:23639725))Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3; FRAGILIS; MIL-1) is part of a larger family of important small interferon-induced transmembrane genes and proteins involved in early development, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation, and which also play a major role in response to bacterial and viral infections and, more recently, in pronounced malignancies. IFITM3, together with tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), PRDM1, and STELLA, has been claimed to be a hallmark of segregated primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Saitou et al., 2002). However, whether IFITM3, like STELLA, is part of a broader stem/progenitor pool that builds the posterior region of the mouse conceptus (Mikedis and Downs, 2012) is obscure. To discover the whereabouts of IFITM3 during mouse gastrulation (~E6.5-9.0), systematic immunohistochemical analysis was carried out at closely spaced 2-4-h intervals. Results revealed diverse, yet consistent, profiles of IFITM3 localization throughout the gastrula. Within the putative PGC trajectory and surrounding posterior tissues, IFITM3 localized as a large cytoplasmic spot with or without staining in the plasma membrane. IFITM3, like STELLA, was also found in the ventral ectodermal ridge (VER), a posterior progenitor pool that builds the tailbud. The large cytoplasmic spot with plasma membrane staining was exclusive to the posterior region; the visceral yolk sac, non-posterior tissues, and epithelial tissues exhibited spots of IFITM3 without cell surface staining. Colocalization of the intracellular IFITM3 spot with the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or endolysosomes was not observed. That relatively high levels of IFITM3 were found throughout the posterior primitive streak and its derivatives is consistent with evidence that IFITM3, like STELLA, is part of a larger stem/progenitor cell pool at the posterior end of the primitive streak that forms the base of the allantois and builds the fetal-umbilical connection, thus further obfuscating practical phenotypic distinctions between so-called PGCs and surrounding soma.((PMID:23325226))VGLUT3-expressing unmyelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) are proposed to mediate pleasant touch and/or pain, but the molecular programs controlling C-LTMR development are unknown. Here, we performed genetic fate mapping, showing that VGLUT3 lineage sensory neurons are divided into two groups, based on transient or persistent VGLUT3 expression. VGLUT3-transient neurons are large- or medium-diameter myelinated mechanoreceptors that form the Merkel cell-neurite complex. VGLUT3-persistent neurons are small-diameter unmyelinated neurons that are further divided into two subtypes: (1) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive C-LTMRs that form the longitudinal lanceolate endings around hairs, and (2) TH-negative neurons that form epidermal-free nerve endings. We then found that VGLUT3-persistent neurons express the runt domain transcription factor Runx1. Analyses of mice with a conditional knock-out of Runx1 in VGLUT3 lineage neurons demonstrate that Runx1 is pivotal to the development of VGLUT3-persistent neurons, such as the expression of VGLUT3 and TH and the formation of the longitudinal lanceolate endings. Furthermore, Runx1 is required to establish mechanosensitivity in C-LTMRs, by controlling the expression of the mechanically gated ion channel Piezo2. Surprisingly, both acute and chronic mechanical pain was largely unaffected in these Runx1 mutants. These findings appear to argue against the recently proposed role of VGLUT3 in C-LTMRs in mediating mechanical hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury or inflammation. Thus, our studies provide new insight into the genetic program controlling C-LTMR development and call for a revisit for the physiological functions of C-LTMRs.((PMID:27288520))The clinical and prognostic relevance of many recently identified driver gene mutations in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly defined. We sequenced the coding regions or hotspot areas of 68 recurrently mutated genes in a cohort of 664 patients aged 18 to 86 years treated on 2 phase 3 trials of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG). The median number of 4 mutations per patient varied according to cytogenetic subgroup, age, and history of previous hematologic disorder or antineoplastic therapy. We found patterns of significantly comutated driver genes suggesting functional synergism. Conversely, we identified 8 virtually nonoverlapping patient subgroups, jointly comprising 78% of AML patients, that are defined by mutually exclusive genetic alterations. These subgroups, likely representing distinct underlying pathways of leukemogenesis, show widely divergent outcomes. Furthermore, we provide detailed information on associations between gene mutations, clinical patient characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes in this large cohort of uniformly treated AML patients. In multivariate analyses including a comprehensive set of molecular and clinical variables, we identified DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutations as important predictors of shorter overall survival (OS) in AML patients <60 years, and particularly in those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD, mutated TP53, and biallelic CEBPA mutations were identified as important molecular prognosticators of OS irrespective of patient age. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the spectrum, clinical associations, and prognostic relevance of recurrent driver gene mutations in a large cohort representing a broad spectrum and age range of intensively treated AML patients.((PMID:27196599))Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive malignancy and the major histological subtype of oesophageal cancer. Although recent large-scale genomic analysis has improved the description of the genetic abnormalities of OSCC, few targetable genomic lesions have been identified, and no molecular therapy is available. This study aims to identify druggable candidates in this tumour.High-throughput small-molecule inhibitor screening was performed to identify potent anti-OSCC compounds. Whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) were conducted to decipher the mechanisms of action of CDK7 inhibition in OSCC. A variety of in vitro and in vivo cellular assays were performed to determine the effects of candidate genes on OSCC malignant phenotypes.The unbiased high-throughput small-molecule inhibitor screening led us to discover a highly potent anti-OSCC compound, THZ1, a specific CDK7 inhibitor. RNA-Seq revealed that low-dose THZ1 treatment caused selective inhibition of a number of oncogenic transcripts. Notably, further characterisation of the genomic features of these THZ1-sensitive transcripts demonstrated that they were frequently associated with super-enhancer (SE). Moreover, SE analysis alone uncovered many OSCC lineage-specific master regulators. Finally, integrative analysis of both THZ1-sensitive and SE-associated transcripts identified a number of novel OSCC oncogenes, including PAK4, RUNX1, DNAJB1, SREBF2 and YAP1, with PAK4 being a potential druggable kinase.Our integrative approaches led to a catalogue of SE-associated master regulators and oncogenic transcripts, which may significantly promote both the understanding of OSCC biology and the development of more innovative therapies.((PMID:26868307))Invertebrates rely on the efficient innate immune mechanisms against invaders, in which the continuous production of hemocytes (hematopoiesis) is indispensable. In the present study, the hematopoietic tissue (HPT) from Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis was identified and characterized. It was a thin and non-transparent sheet located at the dorsolateral side of the stomach, which was composed of a series of ovoid lobules. Each lobule was surrounded by connective tissue containing a large amount of spherical cells with big nucleus. In HPT, the cells were full of mitochondria and granules, and DNA replication was detected in some cells by EdU labeling technique. Cell proliferation was observed in HPT by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The distribution of two transcription factors, GATA1 and RUNX1, were examined by human GATA1 and RUNX1 antibodies, respectively. Three homologues of RUNX1 were detected in the HPT while no signal of RUNX1 was observed in hemocytes, and GATA1 was detected in both HPT and some hemocytes. The mRNA transcript of a novel hematopoiesis related cytokine EsAst was detected in hepatopancreas and hemocytes, but it was no detectable in HPT. The mRNA expression level of EsAst in hepatopancreas was 1.38-fold higher than that in hemocytes. Total hemocytes counts were related to the mRNA expression level of EsAst post Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The results suggested that the stem cells in the hematopoietic tissue of Chinese mitten crab E. sinensis were regulated by transcriptional and humoral factors to generate hemocytes.((PMID:26721895))Familial acute myeloid leukemia is rare and linked to germline mutations in RUNX1, GATA2 or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEBPA). We re-evaluated a large family with acute myeloid leukemia originally seen at NIH in 1969. We used whole exome sequencing to study this family, and conducted in silico bioinformatics analysis, protein structural modeling and laboratory experiments to assess the impact of the identified CEBPA Q311P mutation. Unlike most previously identified germline mutations in CEBPA, which were N-terminal frameshift mutations, we identified a novel Q311P variant that was located in the C-terminal bZip domain of C/EBPα. Protein structural modeling suggested that the Q311P mutation alters the ability of the CEBPA dimer to bind DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the Q311P mu-tant had attenuated binding to DNA, as predicted by the protein modeling. Consistent with these findings, we found that the Q311P mutation has reduced transactivation, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. From 45 years of follow up, we observed incomplete penetrance (46%) of CEBPA Q311P. This study of a large multi-generational pedigree reveals that a germline mutation in the C-terminal bZip domain can alter the ability of C/EBP-α to bind DNA and reduces transactivation, leading to acute myeloid leukemia.((PMID:26476543))In the last decade, a number of genes have been reported to be recurrently associated with myeloid malignancies. While some mutations are easily detectable by conventional molecular genetics methods, other mutations are more difficult to screen because of lower frequency and being scattered along large genomic ranges. However, newly developed approaches for next-generation sequencing provide an affordable solution for targeted multiplex resequencing of up to several hundreds of amplicons. Here, we aimed to develop and validate a novel custom panel for targeted resequencing of myeloid malignancy samples using the Ion PGM(™) System (Ion Torrent, Paisley, UK).We designed a pool of 424 primers for the amplification of 212 amplicons covering 99.46 % of the exonic regions of nine human genes as follows: ASXL1, EZH2, CALR, RUNX1, SETBP1, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, and U2AF1. Initial testing of the panel performance was performed on an Ion PGM(™) machine using PGM(™) 316 v2 chips on 16 DNA samples from patients with myeloid malignancies. Sequence alignment, variant calling, and annotation were performed using Ion Reporter software.We identified a total of 14 nonsynonymous somatic coding variants in seven samples affecting six of the genes in the panel (ASXL1, CALR, RUNX1, SRSF2, TET2, and U2AF1). Notably, three of the identified mutations were not present in the Cosmic v.67 release.This proof-of-concept study confirms the feasibility of Ion Torrent systems for resequencing of clinically relevant mutations in myeloid malignancies. It can be particularly useful in cases without the most frequent clonal markers.((PMID:26164464))The inherited platelet disorders have witnessed a surge in our understanding of molecular mechanisms of disease in the past few years due in large to part to the introduction of next-generation sequencing for discovery of novel genes. The purpose of this review is to update the reader on the novel discoveries with regard to the inherited platelet disorders, with a particular focus on describing the novel disorders described most recently.The description of novel mechanisms of disease including mutations in PRKACG, in a family with severe macrothrombocytopenia, RUNX1 and FLI1 mutations in patients with inherited mild platelet function disorders and CalDAG-GEFI resulting in a severe platelet bleeding phenotype show that there is still much to be learned from studying families and molecular sequencing of patients with well phenotyped platelet disorders.The implications for clinical practice of the continually growing list of genes described in small numbers of families makes whole exome/genome tempting as an option for evaluation of patients, but use outside of the research setting still needs to be done with extreme caution as interpretation of variants is likely to require additional studies.((PMID:25721735))The NFE2 transcription factor was identified over 25 years ago. The NFE2 protein forms heterodimers with small MAF proteins, and the resulting complex binds to regulatory elements in a large number of target genes. In contrast to other CNC transcription family members including NFE2L1 (NRF1), NFE2L2 (NRF2) and NFE2L3 (NRF3), which are widely expressed, earlier studies had suggested that the major sites of NFE2 expression are hematopoietic cells. Based on cell culture studies it was proposed that this protein acts as a critical regulator of globin gene expression. However, the knockout mouse model displayed only mild erythroid abnormalities, while the major phenotype was a defect in megakaryocyte biogenesis. Indeed, absence of NFE2 led to severely impaired platelet production. A series of recent data, also summarized here, shed new light on the various functional roles of NFE2 and the regulation of its activity. NFE2 is part of a complex regulatory network, including transcription factors such as GATA1 and RUNX1, controlling megakaryocytic and/or erythroid cell function. Surprisingly, it was recently found that NFE2 also has a role in non-hematopoietic tissues, such as the trophoblast, in which it is also expressed, as well as the bone, opening the door to new research areas for this transcription factor. Additional data showed that NFE2 function is controlled by a series of posttranslational modifications. Important strides have been made with respect to the clinical significance of NFE2, linking this transcription factor to hematological disorders such as polycythemias.((PMID:25394790))In certain human cancers, the expression of critical oncogenes is driven from large regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, that recruit much of the cell's transcriptional apparatus and are defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac). In a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, we found that heterozygous somatic mutations are acquired that introduce binding motifs for the MYB transcription factor in a precise noncoding site, which creates a super-enhancer upstream of the TAL1 oncogene. MYB binds to this new site and recruits its H3K27 acetylase-binding partner CBP, as well as core components of a major leukemogenic transcriptional complex that contains RUNX1, GATA-3, and TAL1 itself. Additionally, most endogenous super-enhancers found in T-ALL cells are occupied by MYB and CBP, which suggests a general role for MYB in super-enhancer initiation. Thus, this study identifies a genetic mechanism responsible for the generation of oncogenic super-enhancers in malignant cells.((PMID:26710610))Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonizing roots have been increasingly investigated by molecular approaches with AMF-specific PCR primers. However, it is difficult to compare the species diversity and species compositions of AMF communities across various studies due to the PCR primers used differently, and also little is known if significant difference of community compositions is characterized by different primers. We aim to compare the difference of efficiency of four primers for AMF.We chose four commonly used AMF-specific primer combinations (NS31-AM1, AMLl-AML2, NS31-AML2 and SSUmCf-LSUmBr), and used 18S rDNA clone libraries to describe the AMF diversity and community.Our results showed that the specificity and coverage varied among the tested primers, different primer combinations would yield distinct patterns of species diversity and composition of AMF community. SSUmCf-LSUmBr had the best specificity and coverage in amplifying AMF sequences, followed by NS31-AML2 and NS31-AM1, and AML1-AML2 showed the lowest specificity towards AMF sequences.SSUmCf-LSUmBr is not the optimal primer pair for AMF community study in current stage due to limited reference sequences and large DNA size. As an alternative, NS31-AML2 is more suitable in AMF community study, because its target rDNA region could well match the increasingly used virtual taxonomy database (http://maarjam. botany.ut.ee) and also its suitable DNA size could be efficiently used in high-throughput sequencing.((PMID:25886910))DNA methylation is tightly regulated throughout mammalian development, and altered DNA methylation patterns are a general hallmark of cancer. The methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 is frequently mutated in hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and has been suggested to protect CG dinucleotide (CpG) islands and promoters from aberrant DNA methylation. In this study, we present a novel Tet2-dependent leukemia mouse model that closely recapitulates gene expression profiles and hallmarks of human AML1-ETO-induced AML. Using this model, we show that the primary effect of Tet2 loss in preleukemic hematopoietic cells is progressive and widespread DNA hypermethylation affecting up to 25% of active enhancer elements. In contrast, CpG island and promoter methylation does not change in a Tet2-dependent manner but increases relative to population doublings. We confirmed this specific enhancer hypermethylation phenotype in human AML patients with TET2 mutations. Analysis of immediate gene expression changes reveals rapid deregulation of a large number of genes implicated in tumorigenesis, including many down-regulated tumor suppressor genes. Hence, we propose that TET2 prevents leukemic transformation by protecting enhancers from aberrant DNA methylation and that it is the combined silencing of several tumor suppressor genes in TET2 mutated hematopoietic cells that contributes to increased stem cell proliferation and leukemogenesis.((PMID:22289984))The AML1-ETO fusion protein, which is present in 10-15% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, is known to repress myeloid differentiation genes through DNA binding and recruitment of chromatin-modifying proteins and transcription factors in target genes. ChIP-chip analysis of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with the AML1-ETO fusion gene enabled us to identify 1168 AML1-ETO target genes, 103 of which were co-occupied by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and had lost the hyperacetylation mark at histone H4, and 264 showed a K9 trimethylation at histone H3. Enrichment of genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation and in specific signaling pathways was observed in the presence of these epigenetic modifications associated with an 'inactive' chromatin status. Furthermore, AML1-ETO target genes had a significant correlation between the chromatin marks studied and transcriptional silencing. Interestingly, AML1 binding sites were absent on a large number of selected AML1-ETO promoters and an Sp1 binding site was found in over 50% of them. Reversible silencing induced by the fusion protein in the presence of AML1 and/or Sp1 transcription factor binding site was confirmed. Therefore, this study provides a global analysis of AML1-ETO functional chromatin modifications and identifies the important role of Sp1 in the DNA binding pattern of AML1-ETO, suggesting a role for Sp1-targeted therapy in this leukemia subtype.((PMID:22217495))Several large biobanks comprising umbilical cord blood samples have been established allowing efforts to characterize the prevalence and risk factors for preleukemic cell clones in healthy newborns. This study explores the feasibility of demonstrating translocation ETV6-RUNX1 transcripts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in newborns enrolled in a large Danish National Birth Cohort.The study emphasizes the necessity of either storing viable cord blood cells or preparation of the RNA within 1 to 2 days of birth, in large scale studies of the natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, the estimated frequency of translocation ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells was below 10.((PMID:21729552))In order to investigate the epidemiology of childhood acute leukemia (CAL), such as onset age and time, risk factor, subtypes distribution and genetics, 1236 CAL patients admitted in blood disease hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for treatment from April 2004 to April 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. The results showed that the sex ratio of ALL and AML patients were 1.80:1 and 1.73:1 respectively; the average peak age of incidence lasted from 2 to 6 years with the median age of 6 years, while the ALL peak age of incidence lasted from 2 to 5 years but AML showed no significant peak age of incidence. Winter, especially January was the peak time for both onset and birth. Among all the 631 ALL patients who had already been immunophenotyped, B-ALL patients accounted for 83%, T-ALL patients accounted for 9%. Among 361 AML patients, sub-leukemia phenotype from M(0) to M(7) accounted for 0.3%, 2.2%, 29.8%, 20.9%, 8.1%, 25.2%, 4.1% and 4.6% respectively. Among 631 pediatric ALL patients who had been examined by using molecular biology technique, the positive rate of TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, MLL and E2A/PBX1 were 23%, 7.4%, 4.1%, 2.1% respectively. Among 361 pediatric AML patients who had been examined by using molecular biology technique, 19% of the patients showed positive AML1/ETO fusion gene, 18% of the patients showed positive PML/RARα fusion gene, while 4.2% of patients showed positive CBFβ/MYH11. It is concluded that the onset of pediatric acute leukemia is influenced by age, season, environment and different genetic background.((PMID:21505102))Fusion oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) promote self-renewal from committed progenitors, thereby linking transformation and self-renewal pathways. Like most cancers, AML is a genetically and biologically heterogeneous disease, but it is unclear whether transformation results from common or overlapping genetic programs acting downstream of multiple mutations or by the engagement of unique genetic programs acting cooperatively downstream of individual mutations. This distinction is important, because the involvement of common programs would imply the existence of common molecular targets to treat AML, no matter which oncogenes are involved. Here we show that the ability to promote self-renewal is a generalized property of leukemia-associated oncogenes. Disparate oncogenes initiated overlapping transformation and self-renewal gene expression programs, the common elements of which were defined in established leukemic stem cells from an animal model as well as from a large cohort of patients with differing AML subtypes, where they strongly predicted pathobiological character. Notably, individual genes commonly activated in these programs could partially phenocopy the self-renewal function of leukemia-associated oncogenes in committed murine progenitors. Furthermore, they could generate AML following expression in murine bone marrow. In summary, our findings reveal the operation of common programs of self-renewal and transformation downstream of leukemia-associated oncogenes, suggesting that mechanistically common therapeutic approaches to AML are likely to be possible, regardless of the identity of the driver oncogene involved.((PMID:21459790))LMO2 is highly expressed at the most immature stages of lymphopoiesis. In T-lymphocytes, aberrant LMO2 expression beyond those stages leads to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while in B cells LMO2 is also expressed in germinal center lymphocytes and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, where it predicts better clinical outcome. The implication of LMO2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia must still be explored.We measured LMO2 expression by real time RT-PCR in 247 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples with cytogenetic data (144 of them also with survival and immunophenotypical data) and in normal hematopoietic and lymphoid cells.B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases expressed variable levels of LMO2 depending on immunophenotypical and cytogenetic features. Thus, the most immature subtype, pro-B cells, displayed three-fold higher LMO2 expression than pre-B cells, common-CD10+ or mature subtypes. Additionally, cases with TEL-AML1 or MLL rearrangements exhibited two-fold higher LMO2 expression compared to cases with BCR-ABL rearrangements or hyperdyploid karyotype. Clinically, high LMO2 expression correlated with better overall survival in adult patients (5-year survival rate 64.8% (42.5%-87.1%) vs. 25.8% (10.9%-40.7%), P= 0.001) and constituted a favorable independent prognostic factor in B-ALL with normal karyotype: 5-year survival rate 80.3% (66.4%-94.2%) vs. 63.0% (46.1%-79.9%) (P= 0.043).Our data indicate that LMO2 expression depends on the molecular features and the differentiation stage of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Furthermore, assessment of LMO2 expression in adult patients with a normal karyotype, a group which lacks molecular prognostic factors, could be of clinical relevance.((PMID:21447743))VEGFA is considered one of the most important regulators of tumor-associated angiogenesis in cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) VEGFA is an independent prognostic factor for reduced overall and relapse-free survival. Transcriptional activation of the VEGFA promoter, a core mechanism for VEGFA regulation, has not been fully elucidated. We found a significant (P < 0.0001) inverse correlation between expression of VEGFA and AML1/RUNX1 in a large set of gene expression array data. Strikingly, highest VEGFA levels were demonstrated in AML blasts containing a t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1/RUNX1 protein (AML1/ETO). Overexpression of AML1/RUNX1 led to downregulation of VEGFA expression, whereas blocking of AML1/RUNX1 with siRNAs resulted in increased VEGFA expression. Cotransfection of AML1/RUNX1 and VEGFA promoter luciferase promoter constructs resulted in a decrease in VEGFA promoter activity. ChIP analysis shows a direct binding of AML1/RUNX1 to the promoter of VEGFA on three AML1/RUNX1 binding sites. Silencing of AML1/ETO caused a decrease in VEGFA mRNA expression and a decrease in secreted VEGFA protein levels in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells. Taken together, these data pinpoint to a model whereby in normal cells AML1/RUNX1 acts as a repressor for VEGFA, while in AML cells VEGFA expression is upregulated due to AML1/RUNX1 aberrations, for example, AML1/ETO. In conclusion, these observations give insight in the regulation of VEGFA at the mRNA level in AML.((PMID:21302608))Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is the prototypic member of a large family of structurally related pleiotropic-secreted cytokines. The TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway usually participates in a wide range of cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Upon binding on TGF-beta1, the dimerized TGF-beta type II receptors recruit and phosphorylate the TGF-beta type I receptors, which phosphorylate the receptor-regulated SMAD (SMAD2 and SMAD3) presented by the SMAD anchor for receptor activation. The phosphorylated receptor-regulated SMAD form heterologous complexes with the common-mediator SMAD (SMAD4) and subsequently translocate into the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes. This multi-functional signaling pathway modulated by various elements with complex mechanisms at different levels is also inevitably involved in cancer. We herein present data on the role of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway in human chronic myeloid leukemia and explain the potent biological effects of TGF-beta1 on leukemia cells. The paper is based on a review of articles selected from Cancerline and Medline data bases. The constitutively active tyrosine kinase produced by the specific Bcr-Abl fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome can enhance the resistance of malignant cells to TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, which contributes to enhancement of proteasomal degradation of p27. However, overexpression of the EVI1 gene, which is also caused by Bcr-Abl, can recruit the C-terminal binding protein and histone deacetylase to prevent the MH2 domain on SMAD3. The later is essential for transcription activation on target genes and leads to blockage of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway. Some studies have indicated that certain therapeutic agents applied in clinical treatment can inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation of leukemia cells by way of modulation of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signal pathway. For example, arsenic trioxide can promote specific degradation of the AML1/MDS1/EVI1 oncoprotein and inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells. However, specific histone deacetylase inhibitors can interrupt the effect of histone deacetylase to alleviate EVI1-mediated suppression of TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the target therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia can effectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl and induce suppression on the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway. The TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway plays an important role in chronic myeloid leukemia cells and leads the leukemia cells to growth inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis. The positive influence of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia is fairly significant, and its potential effects in clinical treatment will bring about definite benefits. Since it is a complex signaling pathway widely involved in many aspects of cellular activities, further study and comprehensive analysis of the TGF-beta1/SMAD signaling pathway are imperative and will have a guiding significance in research and clinical applications. It is an exciting area for future research.((PMID:21135260))The Graffi murine leukemia virus induces a large spectrum of leukemias in mice and thus provides a good model to compare the transcriptome of all types of leukemias. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of both T and B leukemias induced by the virus with DNA microarrays. Given that we considered that a 4-fold change in expression level was significant, 388 probe sets were associated to B, to T, or common to both leukemias. Several of them were not yet associated with lymphoid leukemia. We confirmed specific deregulation of Fmn2, Arntl2, Bfsp2, Gfra2, Gpm6a, and Gpm6b in B leukemia, of Nln, Fbln1, and Bmp7 in T leukemias, and of Etv5 in both leukemias. More importantly, we show that the mouse Fmn2 induced an anchorage-independent growth, a drastic modification in cell shape with a concomitant disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, we found that human FMN2 is overexpressed in approximately 95% of pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the highest expression levels in patients with a TEL/AML1 rearrangement. These results, surely related to the role of FMN2 in meiotic spindle maintenance, suggest its important role in leukemogenesis. Finally, we propose a new panel of genes potentially involved in T and/or B leukemias.((PMID:20513752))The ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene, present in 25% of B-lineage childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is thought to represent an initiating event, which requires additional genetic changes for leukemia development. To identify additional genetic alterations, 24 ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALLs were analyzed using 500K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The results were combined with previously published data sets, allowing us to ascertain genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 164 cases. In total, 45 recurrent CNAs were identified with an average number of 3.5 recurrent changes per case (range 0-13). Twenty-six percent of cases displayed a set of recurrent CNAs identical to that of other cases in the data set. The majority (74%), however, displayed a unique pattern of recurrent CNAs, indicating a large heterogeneity within this ALL subtype. As previously demonstrated, alterations targeting genes involved in B-cell development were common (present in 28% of cases). However, the combined analysis also identified alterations affecting nuclear hormone response (24%) to be a characteristic feature of ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL. Studying the correlation pattern of the CNAs allowed us to highlight significant positive and negative correlations between specific aberrations. Furthermore, oncogenetic tree models identified ETV6, CDKN2A/B, PAX5, del(6q) and +16 as possible early events in the leukemogenic process.((PMID:19494111))Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) regulates essential cellular functions such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Bcl-2 family of proteins has been implicated as mediators of TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated previously that TGFbeta induces the expression of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a member of the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, to induce cell death in B-lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of TGFbeta-mediated Bim expression in two hepatocyte cell lines that undergo apoptosis with TGFbeta, AML-12 and Hep3B. We show that TGFbeta induces Bim protein and mRNA levels, and its expression is sufficient to induce cell death. Gene array results revealed that Runx1, a member of the Runx family of transcription factors, was induced by TGFbeta, and this induction was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, TGFbeta specifically induced the expression of Runx1 protein from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent, cap-independent, mRNA transcript, and its overexpression was sufficient to induce hepatocyte apo pto sis. Deletion and mutation analyses of the murine Bim promoter identified a putative forkhead binding element, at position -174 to -168 from the transcription start site, as the mediator of Runx1 induction. Co-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Runx1 does not bind directly to the identified forkhead binding element but rather binds the transcriptional regulator FOXO3, which occupies this site. Finally, small interfering RNA knockdown of Runx1 or FOXO3 decreased TGFbeta-induced Bim expression. Our results support a mechanism in which TGFbeta stimulates Bim transcription by up-regulating Runx1 expression, which binds FOXO3, and the two cooperate in the transcriptional induction of Bim.((PMID:7969143))Although most skeletal muscle genes are expressed at similar levels in electrically active, innervated muscle and in electrically inactive, denervated muscle, a small number of genes, including those encoding the acetylcholine receptor, N-CAM, and myogenin, are expressed at significantly higher levels in denervated than in innervated muscle. The mechanisms that mediate electrical activity-dependent gene regulation are not understood, but these mechanisms are likely to be responsible, at least in part, for the changes in muscle structure and function that accompany a decrease in myofiber electrical activity. To understand how muscle activity regulates muscle structure and function, we used a subtractive-hybridization and cloning strategy to identify and isolate genes that are expressed preferentially in innervated or denervated muscle. One of the genes which we found to be regulated by electrical activity is the recently discovered acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) gene. Disruption and translocation of the human AML1 gene are responsible for a form of acute myeloid leukemia. AML1 is a DNA-binding protein, but its normal function is not known and its expression and regulation in skeletal muscle were not previously appreciated. Because of its potential role as a transcriptional mediator of electrical activity, we characterized expression of the AML1 gene in innervated, denervated, and developing skeletal muscle. We show that AML1 is expressed at low levels in innervated skeletal muscle and at 50- to 100-fold-higher levels in denervated muscle. Four AML1 transcripts are expressed in denervated muscle, and the abundance of each transcript increases after denervation. We transfected C2 muscle cells with an expression vector encoding AML1, tagged with an epitope from hemagglutinin, and we show that AML1 is a nuclear protein in muscle. AML1 dimerizes with core-binding factor beta (CBF beta), and we show that CGF beta is expressed at high levels in both innervated and denervated skeletal muscle. PEBP2 alpha, which is structurally related to AML1 and which also dimerizes with CBF beta, is expressed at low levels in skeletal muscle and is up-regulated only weakly by denervation. These results are consistent with the idea that AML1 may have a role in regulating gene expression in skeletal muscle.((PMID:23537631))Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are produced by a small cohort of hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) during development through the formation of intra-aortic hematopoietic cell (HC) clusters. The Runx1 transcription factor plays a key role in the EC-to-HC and -HSC transition. We show that Runx1 expression in hemogenic ECs and the subsequent initiation of HC formation are tightly controlled by the subaortic mesenchyme, although the mesenchyme is not a source of HCs. Runx1 and Notch signaling are involved in this process, with Notch signaling decreasing with time in HCs. Inhibiting Notch signaling readily increases HC production in mouse and chicken embryos. In the mouse, however, this increase is transient. Collectively, we show complementary roles of hemogenic ECs and mesenchymal compartments in triggering aortic hematopoiesis. The subaortic mesenchyme induces Runx1 expression in hemogenic-primed ECs and collaborates with Notch dynamics to control aortic hematopoiesis.((PMID:23932235))The embryonic dorsal aorta plays a pivotal role in the production of the first hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the founders of the adult hematopoietic system. HSC production is polarized by being restricted to the aortic floor where a specialized subset of endothelial cells (ECs) endowed with hemogenic properties undergo an endothelial-to-hematopoietic production resulting in the formation of the intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters. This production is tightly time- and space-controlled with the transcription factor Runx1 playing a key role in this process and the surrounding tissues controlling the aortic shape and fate. In this paper, we shall review (a) how hemogenic ECs differentiate from the mesoderm, (b) how the different aortic components assemble coordinately to establish the dorso-ventral polarity, and (c) how this results in the initiation of Runx1 expression in hemogenic ECs and the initiation of the hematopoietic program. These observations should elucidate the first steps in HSC commitment and help in developing techniques to manipulate adult HSCs.((PMID:22305260))Vascular calcification is an active deposition process of calcium phosphate which resembles bone formation and is highly regulated by osteoblast-like cells. Existing studies demonstrate that advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) may play a pathogenic role in the vascular calcification process. However, their mechanism remains poorly understood. The aim of our current study is to investigate how non-cross-link and non-fluorescent N(ε)-carboxymethyl-Lysine (CML), a major immunogen of AGEs, affect the progression of atherosclerotic calcification in diabetes.The present study consisted of an in vivo investigation and two in vitro investigations. In study I, male apoE(-/-) mice were first rendered diabetic by the administration of 5 daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg), and then given a semi-synthetic high-fat diet (HFD) plus daily injections of CML (10mg/kg/day). The mice were euthanized and analyzed at 0 month (group 0M, n = 10), 2 months (group 2M, n = 10), and 4 months (group 4M, n = 10) after the triple administrations of STZ-CML-HFD. In study II, the effects of CML on the apoptosis in macrophages were investigated. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with or without 50 μg/mL oxLDL plus various concentrations of CML for 48 h. In study III, we investigated whether A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells were induced into osteoblast-like phenotypes by incubation with or without 80 μg/mL of RAW264.7-derived-apoptotic bodies and 50 μg/mL of oxLDL plus various concentrations of CML (or high-glucose) for 7 days. Related analyses (i.e., H&E staining, Masson staining, von Kossa staining, TUNEL staining, immunohistochemical staining, calcium content assay, annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining, and Western blot) were performed.Morphological analysis showed that early atherosclerotic plaques appeared 2 months after the triple administrations of STZ-CML-HFD, and that typically advanced plaques with extensive calcification lesions, abundant cholesterol crystals, and proliferative collagen were formed 4 months after the triple administrations of STZ-CML-HFD. Furthermore, CML deposition signals and the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in the aortic wall were mainly restricted in the atherosclerotic plaques. After the incubation of A7r5 smooth muscle cells with 10 μmol/L CML plus 50 μg/mL oxLDL, and 80 μg/mL apoptotic bodies (ABs) for 7 days, semi-quantitative analysis of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), core-binding factor α1 (cbfα1), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression showed 5.0-, 2.0-, and 2.9-fold increases, respectively, compared with those in 50 μg/mL oxLDL and 80 μg/mL ABs. Subsequently, a similar trend was observed in the calcium deposition of the cell layer. However, high-glucose had no effects on the ALP activity and calcium deposition of A7r5 cell layer under high-lipid, apoptosis-coexisting conditions. Both animal and cell studies consistently demonstrated that the CML/RAGE axis may first initiate the apoptosis of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and then induce BMP-2-cbfα1-ALP-calcification cascade in a high-lipid, apoptosis-coexisting environment.The CML/RAGE axis may play an important role in atherosclerotic calcification of diabetes through the mechanism that induces the apoptosis of macrophages followed by the osteogenic differentiation of aortic smooth muscle cells.((PMID:26634964))L-ergothioneine (ET), a putative antioxidant compound acquired by animals through dietary sources, has been suggested to accumulate in certain cells and tissues in the body that are predisposed to high oxidative stress. In the present study, we identified an elevation of ET in the liver of a guinea pig model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), elucidated a possible mechanism for the increased uptake and investigated the possible role for this accumulation. This increase in liver ET levels correlated with cholesterol accumulation and disease severity. We identified an increase in the transcriptional factor, RUNX1, which has been shown to upregulate the expression of the ET-specific transporter OCTN1, and could consequently lead to the observable elevation in ET. An increase was also seen in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) which seemingly corresponds to ET elevation. No significant increase was observed in oxidative damage markers, F2-isoprostanes, and protein carbonyls, which could possibly be attributed to the increase in liver ET through direct antioxidant action, induction of HSP70, or by chelation of Fe(2+), preventing redox chemistry. The data suggest a novel mechanism by which the guinea pig fatty liver accumulates ET via upregulation of its transporter, as a possible stress response by the damaged liver to further suppress oxidative damage and delay tissue injury. Similar events may happen in other animal models of disease, and researchers should be aware of the possibility.((PMID:23239112))The effects of exogenous hormones, used for estrus synchronization and ovarian hyper stimulation, on cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) gene expression in sexually mature rats were determined using microarrays. Gene expression in COCs collected from GnRH (G(trt)), GnRH + eCG (G + E(trt)), and GnRH + eCG + hCG (G + E + H(trt)) treatments were compared to COCs from naturally cycling (NC) rats before the preovulatory luteninizing hormone surge. There was no significant difference in gene expression among NC, G(trt), and G + E(trt); however, over 2,600 genes were significantly different between NC and G + E + H(trt) (P < 0.05). Genes upregulated in G + E + H(trt) encode for: proteins that are involved in prostaglandin synthesis (Ptgs2, Pla2g4a, and Runx1) and cholesterol biosynthesis (Hmgcr, Sc4mol, and Dhcr24); receptors that allow cholesterol uptake (Ldlr and Scarb1), regulate progesterone synthesis (Star), and inactivate estrogen (Sult1e1); and downstream effectors of LH signal (Pgr, Cebpb, Creb3l1, Areg, Ereg, and Adamts1). Conversely, G + E + H(trt) downregulated genes encoding proteins involved in: DNA replication and cell cycle progression (Ccne2, Orc5l, Rad50, and Mcm6); reproductive developmental process; and granulosa cell expansion (Gdf9, Bmp15, Amh, Amhr2, Bmpr1b, Tgfb2, Foxl2, Pde3a, Esr2, Fshr, Ybx2, Ccnd2, Ccnb1ip1, and Zp3); maternal effect genes required for embryo development (Zar1, Npm2, Nlrp5, Dnmt1, H1foo, and Zfp57); amino acid degradation; and ketogenesis (Hmgcs2, and Cpt1b). These results from the rat show that hormones used for estrus synchronization (G(trt)) and ovarian hyper stimulation (G + E(trt)) had minimal effects on gene expression, whereas induction of ovulation (G + E + H(trt)) caused major changes in gene expression of rat COCs. This study provides comprehensive information about regulated genes during late follicle development and ovulation induction.((PMID:24145030))Th17 cells are important effectors of immunity to extracellular pathogens, particularly at mucosal surfaces, but they can also contribute to pathologic tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. Defining the multitude of factors that influence their development is therefore of paramount importance. Our previous studies using Ikaros(-/-) CD4+ T cells implicated Ikaros in Th1 versus Th2 lineage decisions. Here we demonstrate that Ikaros also regulates Th17 differentiation through its ability to promote expression of multiple Th17 lineage-determining genes, including Ahr, Runx1, Rorc, Il17a, and Il22. Ikaros exerts its influence on the chromatin remodeling of these loci at two distinct stages in CD4+ T helper cell development. In naive cells, Ikaros is required to limit repressive chromatin modifications at these gene loci, thus maintaining the potential for expression of the Th17 gene program. Subsequently, Ikaros is essential for the acquisition of permissive histone marks in response to Th17 polarizing signals. Additionally, Ikaros represses the expression of genes that limit Th17 development, including Foxp3 and Tbx21. These data define new targets of the action of Ikaros and indicate that Ikaros plays a critical role in CD4+ T cell differentiation by integrating specific cytokine cues and directing epigenetic modifications that facilitate activation or repression of relevant genes that drive T cell lineage choice.((PMID:21343615))Forced expression of the transcription factor HoxB4 has been shown to enhance the self-renewal capacity of mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and confer a long-term repopulating capacity to yolk sac and embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived hematopoietic precursors. The fact that ES cell-derived precursors do not repopulate bone marrow without HoxB4 underscores an important role for HoxB4 in the maturation of ES-derived hematopoietic precursors into long-term repopulating HSCs. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process is barely understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of HoxB4 using ES cell-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The results revealed many of the genes essential for HSC development to be direct targets of HoxB4, such as Runx1, Scl/Tal1, Gata2, and Gfi1. The expression profiling also showed that HoxB4 indirectly affects the expression of several important genes, such as Lmo2, Erg, Meis1, Pbx1, Nov, AhR, and Hemgn. HoxB4 tended to activate the transcription, but the down-regulation of a significant portion of direct targets suggested its function to be context-dependent. These findings indicate that HoxB4 reprograms a set of key regulator genes to facilitate the maturation of developing HSCs into repopulating cells. Our list of HoxB4 targets also provides novel candidate regulators for HSCs.((PMID:17560011))AML1-ETO fusion protein is a product of chromosome translocation t(8;21) frequently occurred in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its sole expression appears to fail to cause overt leukemia in vivo. In this study, we investigated whether AML1-ETO expression impinged on action of chemical carcinogens-DNA adduct formation.AML1-ETO fusion protein was conditionally induced in engineered U937-A/E 9/14/18 cells. The formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-DNA adducts and the expression of PAH-metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) were detected by Western blot and/or quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase reporter system was used to detect the regulation of AML1-ETO on CYP1A1 transcription.Our results showed that AML1-ETO induction significantly increased the formation of carcinogen benzopyrene-DNA adducts in leukemic cells. In line with the effect, we also found that AML1-ETO induction upregulated CYP1A1 expression, which was dependent on AML1-binding motif in the promotor of CYP1A1 gene. Additionally, AML1-ETO protein also increased AhR expression, a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates PAHs-induced CYP1A1 gene expression.These data, combined with its inhibitory effect on DNA repair as reported previously, propose that the presence of AML1-ETO increases the susceptibility of cells to chemical carcinogens, which favors the development of additional genetic alterations.((PMID:19285840))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a class of prevalent hematopoietic malignancies, is caused by the acquisition of gene mutations that confer deregulated proliferation, impaired differentiation and a survival advantage of hematopoietic progenitors. More recently, we reported that cobalt chloride (CoCl(2))/iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO)-mimicked hypoxia or moderate hypoxia (2% and 3% O(2)) can directly trigger differentiation of many subtypes of AML cells. Also, intermittent hypoxia significantly prolongs the survival of the transplanted leukemic mice with differentiation induction of leukemic cells. Additionally, these hypoxia-simulating agents selectively stimulate differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemic cells induced by arsenic trioxide, an effective second-line drug for this unique type of leukemia. Based on this interesting evidence in vitro and in vivo, the ongoing investigations showed the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) protein through its non-transcriptional activity in myeloid cell differentiation, as evidenced by chemical interference, the conditional HIF-1alpha induction, the specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta, an essential partner for transcription activity of HIF-1. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha and two hematopoietic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) and Runx1/AML1 interact directly with each other. Such interactions increase the transcriptional activities of C/EBPalpha and Runx1/AML1, while C/EBPalpha competes with HIF-1beta for direct binding to HIF-1alpha protein, and significantly inhibits the DNA-binding ability of HIF-1. As a protein is rapidly responsive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a classical clinical differentiation-inducing drug for AML, HIF-1alpha also plays a role in ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells.((PMID:16467864))AML1/RUNX1 mutations have been reported frequently in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, especially those diagnosed with refractory anemia with excess blast (RAEB), RAEB in transformation (RAEBt), or AML following MDS (these categories are defined as MDS/AML). Although AML1 mutations are suspected to play a pivotal role in the development of MDS/AML, acquisition of additional genetic alterations is also necessary. We analyzed gene alterations in MDS/AML patients with AML1 mutations, comparing them to alterations in those without an AML1 mutation. AML1 mutations were significantly associated with -7/7q-, whereas MDS/AML patients without AML1 mutations showed a high frequency of -5/5q- and a complex karyotype. Patients with AML1 mutations showed more mutations of their FLT3, N-RAS, PTPN11, and NF1 genes, resulting in a significantly higher mutation frequency for receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-RAS signaling pathways in AML1-mutated MDS/AML patients compared to AML1-wild-type MDS/AML patients (38% versus 6.3%, P < 0.0001). Conversely, p53 mutations were detected only in patients without AML1 mutations. Furthermore, blast cells of the AML1-mutated patients expressing surface c-KIT, and SHP-2 mutants contributed to prolonged and enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation following stem cell factor stimulation. Our results suggest that MDS/AML arising from AML1/RUNX1 mutations has a significant association with -7/7q- alteration, and frequently involves RTK-RAS signaling pathway activation.((PMID:14982869))SHP-2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as signal transducer downstream to growth factor and cytokine receptors. SHP-2 is required during development, and germline mutations in PTPN11, the gene encoding SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome. SHP-2 plays a crucial role in hematopoietic cell development. We recently demonstrated that somatic PTPN11 mutations are the most frequent lesion in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and are observed in a smaller percentage of children with other myeloid malignancies. Here, we report that PTPN11 lesions occur in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Mutations were observed in 23 of 317 B-cell precursor ALL cases, but not among 44 children with T-lineage ALL. In the former, lesions prevalently occurred in TEL-AML1(-) cases with CD19(+)/CD10(+)/cyIgM(-) immunophenotype. PTPN11, NRAS, and KRAS2 mutations were largely mutually exclusive and accounted for one third of common ALL cases. We also show that, among 69 children with acute myeloid leukemia, PTPN11 mutations occurred in 4 of 12 cases with acute monocytic leukemia (FAB-M5). Leukemia-associated PTPN11 mutations were missense and were predicted to result in SHP-2 gain-of-function. Our findings provide evidence for a wider role of PTPN11 lesions in leukemogenesis, but also suggest a lineage-related and differentiation stage-related contribution of these lesions to clonal expansion.((PMID:26595813))The DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B are primarily responsible for de novo methylation of specific cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides during mammalian development. While loss-of-function mutations in DNMT3A are highly recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DNMT3A mutations are almost never found in AML patients with translocations that create oncogenic fusion genes such as PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and MLL-AF9. Here, we explored how DNMT3A is involved in the function of these fusion genes. We used retroviral vectors to express PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, or MLL-AF9 in bone marrow cells derived from WT or DNMT3A-deficient mice. Additionally, we examined the phenotypes of hematopoietic cells from Ctsg-PML-RARA mice, which express PML-RARA in early hematopoietic progenitors and myeloid precursors, with or without DNMT3A. We determined that the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, is required for aberrant PML-RARA-driven self-renewal ex vivo and that DNMT3A is dispensable for RUNX1-RUNX1T1- and MLL-AF9-driven self-renewal. Furthermore, both the PML-RARA-driven competitive transplantation advantage and development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) required DNMT3A. Together, these findings suggest that PML-RARA requires DNMT3A to initiate APL in mice.((PMID:26594843))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is mostly driven by oncogenic transcription factors, which have been classically viewed as intractable targets using small-molecule inhibitor approaches. Here we demonstrate that AML driven by repressive transcription factors, including AML1-ETO (encoded by the fusion oncogene RUNX1-RUNX1T1) and PML-RARα fusion oncoproteins (encoded by PML-RARA) are extremely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition, in part owing to their suppressed expression of key homologous recombination (HR)-associated genes and their compromised DNA-damage response (DDR). In contrast, leukemia driven by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, encoded by KMT2A) fusions with dominant transactivation ability is proficient in DDR and insensitive to PARP inhibition. Intriguingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of an MLL downstream target, HOXA9, which activates expression of various HR-associated genes, impairs DDR and sensitizes MLL leukemia to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Conversely, HOXA9 overexpression confers PARPi resistance to AML1-ETO and PML-RARα transformed cells. Together, these studies describe a potential utility of PARPi-induced synthetic lethality for leukemia treatment and reveal a novel molecular mechanism governing PARPi sensitivity in AML.((PMID:24449212))PML-RARA and AML1-ETO are important oncogenic fusion proteins that play a central role in transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whether these fusion proteins render the tumor cells with immune evasion properties is unknown. Here we show that both oncogenic proteins specifically downregulate the expression of CD48, a ligand of the natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor 2B4, thereby leading to decreased killing by NK cells. We demonstrate that this process is histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent, that it is mediated through the downregulation of CD48 messenger RNA, and that treatment with HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) restores the expression of CD48. Furthermore, by using chromatin immunoprecepitation (ChIP) experiments, we show that AML1-ETO directly interacts with CD48. Finally, we show that AML patients who are carrying these specific translocations have low expression of CD48.((PMID:24331925))Delineating the mechanism or mechanisms that regulate the specification of hemogenic endothelial cells from primordial endothelium is critical for optimizing their derivation from human stem cells for clinical therapies. We previously determined that retinoic acid (RA) is required for hemogenic specification, as well as cell-cycle control, of endothelium during embryogenesis. Herein, we define the molecular signals downstream of RA that regulate hemogenic endothelial cell development and demonstrate that cell-cycle control is required for this process. We found that re-expression of c-Kit in RA-deficient (Raldh2(-/-)) primordial endothelium induced Notch signaling and p27 expression, which restored cell-cycle control and rescued hemogenic endothelial cell specification and function. Re-expression of p27 in RA-deficient and Notch-inactivated primordial endothelial cells was sufficient to correct their defects in cell-cycle regulation and hemogenic endothelial cell development. Thus, RA regulation of hemogenic endothelial cell specification requires c-Kit, notch signaling, and p27-mediated cell-cycle control.((PMID:24145192))Both radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs induce autophagy in tumor cells, and whether this contributes to cell death or survival is debated. Although a prodeath role has been reported in certain contexts, treatment-induced autophagy often exerts a prosurvival function by preventing apoptosis and delaying necrosis. Interestingly, a more specific role of autophagy has been demonstrated in certain subtypes of leukemia. The fusion oncoproteins PML-RARA and BCR-ABL, the main oncogenic drivers of acute promyelocytic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), respectively, have recently been identified as autophagy substrates and their degradation by autophagy shown to contribute to treatment. However, this does not seem to be a general feature of leukemic fusion oncoproteins, as we recently found that AML1-ETO, the most frequently occurring acute myeloid leukemia (AML) fusion protein, is not an autophagy substrate. Rather we demonstrate a clear prosurvival role of autophagy in this AML subtype and that addition of autophagy inhibitors in the treatment regimen might be beneficial.((PMID:23970379))The role of autophagy during leukemia treatment is unclear. On the one hand, autophagy might be induced as a prosurvival response to therapy, thereby reducing treatment efficiency. On the other hand, autophagy may contribute to degradation of fusion oncoproteins, as recently demonstrated for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α and breakpoint cluster region-abelson, thereby facilitating leukemia treatment. Here, we investigated these opposing roles of autophagy in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, which express the most frequently occurring AML fusion oncoprotein, AML1-eight-twenty-one (ETO). We demonstrate that autophagy is induced by AML1-ETO-targeting drugs, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) valproic acid (VPA) and vorinostat. Furthermore, we show that autophagy does not mediate degradation of AML1-ETO but rather has a prosurvival role in AML cells, as inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the viability and colony-forming ability of HDACi-treated AML cells. Combined treatment with HDACis and autophagy inhibitors such as chloroquine (CQ) led to a massive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins that correlated with increased cell death. Finally, we show that VPA induced autophagy in t(8;21) AML patient cells, and combined treatment with CQ enhanced cell death. Because VPA and CQ are well-tolerated drugs, combinatorial therapy with VPA and CQ could represent an attractive treatment option for AML1-ETO-positive leukemia.((PMID:23826571))((PMID:23319320))Adipose tissue is a potential site of retinoic acid (RA) action, but its physiological significance remains to be clarified. We have examined the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on growth and differentiation of preadipocytes, and on adipokine gene expression in mature adipocytes using human preadipocyte cell model, AML-I. Both ATRA and 9-cis RA induced growth arrest in AML-I preadipocyte at between 50 and 100 µM, which was accompanied by apoptosis. Western blotting showed a loss of NF-κB, Bcl-2 and p-Akt, and the accumulation of Bad and Akt in cytoplasm of ATRA-treated AML-I preadipocytes. Exposure of AML-I to ATRA or 9-cis RA increased intracellular lipid accumulation in a time-dependent manner compared to vehicle-treated cells. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) proteins was increased in ATRA-treated cells. Thus, both ATRA and 9-cis RA promoted differentiation, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML-I preadipocytes. ATRA also modulated adipokine expression by increasing the mRNA level of adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin and LPL), and by inhibiting PAI-1 mRNA expression in mature AML-I adipocytes. The data suggest that ATRA exerts a wide range of effects--growth arrest, apoptosis, lipogenesis and modulation of adipokine gene expression--during the maturation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.((PMID:23228968))All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used successfully in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). ATRA enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal through retinoic acid receptor (RAR)γ activation while promoting differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors through RARα activation. Its lack of success in the treatment of non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may be related to ATRA's non-selectivity for the RARα and RARγ isotypes, and specific RARα activation may be more beneficial in promoting myeloid differentiation. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of ATRA and the specific RARα agonist NRX195183 was assessed in AML1-ETO (AE)-expressing murine bone marrow (BM) progenitors. ATRA potentiated the in vitro clonogenicity of these cells while NRX195183 had the opposite effect. Morphological and flow cytometric analysis confirmed a predominantly immature myeloid population in the ATRA-treated AE cells while the NRX195183-treated cells demonstrated an increase in the mature myeloid population. Similarly, NRX195183 treatment promoted myeloid differentiation in an AE9a in vivo murine model. In the ATRA-treated AE cells, gene expression analyses revealed functional networks involving SERPINE1 and bone morphogenetic protein 2; AKT phosphorylation was upregulated. Collectively, these findings confirm the contrasting roles of specific RARα and RARγ activation in the clonogenicity and differentiation of AE cells with potential significant implications in the treatment of non-APL AML using a specific RARα agonist.((PMID:23133936))((PMID:22923494))Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in regulating cell type specific gene expression during hematopoiesis but has also been suggested to be aberrantly regulated during leukemogenesis. To understand the leukemogenic chromatin signature, we analyzed acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of leukemia characterized by the expression of RARα-fusion proteins, such as PML-RARα. We used nuclease accessibility sequencing in cell lines as well as patient blasts to identify accessible DNA elements and identified > 100 000 accessible regions in each case. Using ChIP-seq, we identified H2A.Z as a histone modification generally associated with these accessible regions, whereas unsupervised clustering analysis of other chromatin features, including DNA methylation, H2A.Zac, H3ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and the regulatory factor p300, distinguished 6 distinct clusters of accessible sites, each with a characteristic functional makeup. Of these, PML-RARα binding was found specifically at accessible chromatin regions characterized by p300 binding and hypoacetylated histones. Identifying regions with a similar epigenetic make up in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, another subtype of AMLs, revealed that these regions are occupied by the oncofusion protein AML1-ETO. Together, our results suggest that oncofusion proteins localize to accessible regions and that chromatin accessibility together with p300 binding and histone acetylation characterize AML1-ETO and PML-RARα binding sites.((PMID:22714999))Leukemia, a group of hematological malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, is a disease involving dynamic change in the genome. Chromosomal translocation and point mutation are the major mechanisms in leukemia, which lead to production of oncogenes with dominant gain of function and tumor suppressor genes with recessive loss of function. Targeted therapy refers to treatment strategies perturbing the molecules critical for leukemia pathogenesis. The t(15;17) which generates PML-RARα, t(8;21) that produces AML1-ETO, and t(9;22) which generates BCR-ABL are the three most frequently seen chromosomal translocations in myeloid leukemia. The past two to three decades have witnessed tremendous success in development of targeted therapies for acute and chronic myeloid leukemia caused by the three fusion proteins. Here, we review the therapeutic efficacies and the mechanisms of action of targeted therapies for myeloid leukemia and show how this strategy significantly improve the clinical outcome of patients and even turn acute promyelocytic leukemia from highly fatal to highly curable.((PMID:21638933))To evaluate the value of multiprobe Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel in detection of the common cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloidleukemia( AML). And to investigate its association with clinical diagnosis, chemotherapy and prognosis.Using the multiprobe AML/MDS panel designed to detect upto eight different FISH probes, which was for AML1/ETO transfusion gene, PML-RARα transfusion gene, CBFβ/MYH11 transfusion gene, MLL breakapart, P53 deletion,Del(5q), Del(7q), Del(20q), 40 cases of AML were investigated. The conventional karyotype analysis and the in-formation about the treatment responses were also used for assessing.22 of the 40 AML cases were found to carry 7 types of cytogenetic abnormalities by multiprobe FISH panel including AML1/ETO transfusion gene, PML-RARa transfusion gene, MLL breakapart, P53 deletion, Del (5q), Del7q and trisomy 8. However conventional karyotype analysis only discovered 11 cases with the corresponding cytogenetic abnormalities, the positive ratio was 57.5% in multiprobe FISH panel higher than that in karyotype analysis (27.50%). Patiens with AML1/ETO or PML-RARa transfusion gene are easily to reach CR in the first induction chemotherapy, while the Del(7q), MLL breakapart, complex cytogenetic abnormalities may indicate poor prognosis.Mutiprobe FISH panel is more rapid, accurate and effective for detecting the common cytogenetic abnormalities in AML, compared with the conventional karyotype analysis and common FISH analysis.((PMID:21316759))Mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the characteristics of IDH1-mutated AML are still not known clearly. We analyzed 416 Chinese AML patients and found 28 patients (6.7%) carried this mutation. One homozygous IDH1 mutant in AML was found. The IDH1 mutations were associated with NPM1 mutations (P=0.043) and could coexist with recurrent transcription factor aberrations including AML1-ETO (6/50), PML-RARα (3/77) and CBFβ-MYH11 (1/15). For AML with AML1-ETO fusion gene, IDH1(mut) patients may have worse disease-free survival (DFS) than IDH1(wild-type) patients.((PMID:21178013))Hematopoietic lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells are essential for the development of secondary lymphoid tissues including lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Two transcription factors, the helix-loop-helix inhibitor Id2 and the retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (Rorγt), have been shown to be crucial for LTi cell development. However, it remains unclear how the specification of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells toward the LTi lineage is programmed. In this study, we report impaired lymphoid tissue organogenesis in mice in which the function of Runx1/Cbfβ transcription factor complexes was attenuated by the loss of either the distal promoter-derived Runx1 or Cbfβ2 variant protein. We found that LTi progenitors in fetal liver, defined previously as a lineage marker-negative α4β7 integrin (α4β7)(+) IL-7R α-chain (IL-7Rα)(+) population, can be subdivided into Rorγt-expressing IL-7Rα(high) cells and nonexpressing IL-7Rα(mid) cells. Whereas Id2 and Rorγt are required to direct α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(mid) cells to become α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(high) cells, Runx1/Cbfβ2 complexes are necessary for the emergence of α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(mid) cells. In addition, the loss of Cbfβ2, but not P1-Runx1, resulted in an inefficient upregulation of Rorγt in residual α4β7(+)IL-7Rα(+) LTi cells at anlagen. Our results thus revealed that Runx1/Cbfβ2 complexes regulate the differentiation of LTi cells at two stages: an early specification of hematopoietic progenitors toward the LTi lineage and a subsequent activation of Rorγt expression at anlagen.((PMID:21168207))CMTM5 has been shown to exhibit tumor suppressor activities, however, its role in leukemia is unclear. Herein we firstly reported the expression and function of CMTM5 in myeloid leukemia. CMTM5 was down-regulated, or undetectable, in leukemia cell lines and bone marrow cells from leukemia patients with promoter methylation. Ectopic expression of CMTM5-v1 strongly inhibited the proliferation of K562 and MEG-01 cells. In addition, significant negative correlations were observed between CMTM5 and three leukemia-specific fusion genes (AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and BCR/ABL1). CMTM5 expression was up-regulated in patients who had undergone treatment. Therefore, CMTM5 may be involved in the pathomechanism of myeloid leukemias.((PMID:21104160))Chemical biology, using small molecules as probes to study the cellular signaling network, has developed rapidly in recent years. The interaction between chemistry and biology not only provides new insight into the understanding of cellular activities, but also generates new lead compounds for the treatment of diseases. Transcription factors and kinases such as retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARα), acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1), CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), c-myc, and c-abl play important roles in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Abnormalities in these proteins may cause the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and even the occurrence of leukemia. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation represents a critical mechanism in regulating the cellular levels and functions of these proteins. Thus, targeting protein degradation has been emerging as an important strategy to conquer malignant diseases. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances in the understanding of the roles of protein degradation in leukemia, with an emphasis on the mechanisms revealed by small molecules.((PMID:20395453))Leukotriene B(4) type-1 receptor (BLT1), which plays a role in various inflammatory diseases, is exclusively expressed in peripheral leukocytes, which suggests that its expression is stringently regulated. However, the precise mechanism of BLT1 expression is not fully understood. Here we report that acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1/Runx1) is involved in the enhancement of BLT1 expression in leukocytes. In retinoic acid (RA)-stimulated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, the transcription of the BLT1 gene was found to be significantly activated. RA did not directly modulate the BLT1 promoter, suggesting enhancers in other loci. DNase I-hypersensitivity analyses revealed an activated region, termed AE-BLex, at the intron-I:exon-II boundary. AE-BLex acts as an enhancer for the BLT1 promoter and possesses 2 AML1 recognition sites. The importance of AML1 was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, reporter assays, and knockdown experiments. We demonstrated that the enhancement of BLT1 expression during the RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is due to a loosening of the chromatin structure around AE-BLex, which leads to the incremental binding of AML1. The AML1/AE-BLex complex was confirmed in other BLT1- expressing leukemia cell lines and human peripheral leukocytes. Thus, AML1 enhances BLT1 expression by binding to AE-BLex, which is accessible in leukocytes.((PMID:26148230))The ETS transcription factor ERG has been implicated as a major regulator of both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemias harboring t(16;21), ERG function is deregulated due to a fusion with FUS/TLS resulting in the expression of a FUS-ERG oncofusion protein. How this oncofusion protein deregulates the normal ERG transcription program is unclear. Here, we show that FUS-ERG acts in the context of a heptad of proteins (ERG, FLI1, GATA2, LYL1, LMO2, RUNX1 and TAL1) central to proper expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype. Moreover, in t(16;21) FUS-ERG co-occupies genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR:RARA inhibiting target gene expression and interfering with hematopoietic differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS-ERG knockdown alleviate the myeloid-differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS-ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.((PMID:24769646))All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is well established as differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which the PML-RARα (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α) fusion protein causes blockade of the retinoic acid (RA) pathway; however, in types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) other than APL, the mechanism of RA pathway inactivation is not fully understood. This study revealed the potential mechanism of high ATRA sensitivity of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-AF9-positive AML compared with MLL-AF4/5q31-positive AML. Treatment with ATRA induced significant myeloid differentiation accompanied by upregulation of RARα, C/EBPα, C/EBPɛ and PU.1 in MLL-AF9-positive but not in MLL-AF4/5q31-positive cells. Combining ATRA with cytarabine had a synergistic antileukemic effect in MLL-AF9-positive cells in vitro. The level of dimethyl histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2) in the RARα gene-promoter region, PU.1 upstream regulatory region (URE) and RUNX1+24/+25 intronic enhancer was higher in MLL-AF9-positive cells than in MLL-AF4-positive cells, and inhibiting lysine-specific demethylase 1, which acts as a histone demethylase inhibitor, reactivated ATRA sensitivity in MLL-AF4-positive cells. These findings suggest that the level of H3K4me2 in the RARα gene-promoter region, PU.1 URE and RUNX1 intronic enhancer is determined by the MLL-fusion partner. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of ATRA sensitivity in AML and novel treatment strategies for ATRA-resistant AML.((PMID:25543697))To investigate the characteristics and the short- or long-term treatment outcomes of the adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in China.From 1999 to 2010, 822 adult cases with AML were enrolled, diagnosed and classified by the FAB and WHO criteria, respectively. The treatment outcomes and prognostic factors were analyzed retrospectively.In all patients with a median age of 38.5(15-83) years, acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (M5), AML with t(15;17)/PML-RARα (APL) and AML with t(8;21)/AML1-ETO(M2b) were the most common subtypes, accounting for 29.7%, 20.9% and 14.6% respectively. In APL patients, CR was achieved in 95.2%, with an early death (ED) rate of 4.8%. And the estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 year was 87.5% and 88.8%, respectively. Patients with other AML subtype (Non-APL) revealed a CR rate of 82.0%, ED of 4.3%, and estimated 5-year OS and DFS both of 48.8%. The OS rate of Non-APL patients at 3-year varied significantly (P<0.01) among three prognostic groups by cytogenetic risk stratification:favorable, 69.5%; intermediate, 52.8%; unfavorable, 29.8%. The prognostic factors for OS among Non-APL included age, cytogenetic abnormalities, courses of the median/high-dose cytarabine and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.When compared with the previous reports, the AML patients in our study were younger and showed a different subtype distribution. Treatment outcomes of APL and Non-APL were just the same as those in international leukemia centers. Chemotherapy by risk stratification, after diagnosis and classification according to the WHO criteria, is a key point to improve the outcomes in AML.((PMID:25543469))This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between expression of CD200 antigen and clinical characteristics in AML patients and to analyse the value of CD200 in evaluation of AML prognosis. The CD200 and immunophenotypes were detected by flow cytometry, the chromosome karyotypes were determined by R banding, the FISH was used to measure the AML1/ETO, PML/RARa and inv(16), and PCR technique was used to detect the fusion genes AML1/ETO and PML/RARα. The results showed that the positive rate of CD200 antigen expression in 54 patients was 57.4% (31/54), the CD200 antigen expression between sex and age of patients was no significant different (P > 0.05). There was significant difference of CD200 expression between CD34 and CD117 (P < 0.05), but the difference of CD200 expression in chromosome karyotypes was no significant difference(P > 0.05). Moreover, there was significant difference of CD200 expression in CD34 and CD117 of CBF positive AML patients (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the CD200 antigen expression in AML may associate with a poor prognosis of patients.((PMID:20388510))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated translocations often cause gene fusions that encode oncofusion proteins. Although many of the breakpoints involved in chromosomal translocations have been cloned, in most cases the role of the chimeric proteins in tumorigenesis is not elucidated. Here we will discuss the fusion proteins of the 4 most common translocations associated with AML as well as the common molecular mechanisms that these four and other fusion proteins utilize to transform progenitor cells. Intriguingly, although the individual partners within the fusion proteins represent a wide variety of cellular functions, at the molecular level many commodities can be found.((PMID:19491417))Recurrent balanced translocations are generally recognized to be a major parameter for prognostication in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The chromosomal translocation t(15;17) results in PML/RARalpha fusion gene, t(8;21) results in AML1/ETO fusion gene and Inv 16 generates CBFbeta/MYH11 fusion gene. Patients with these mutations have a good prognosis unlike abnormalities in chromosome 5 or 7 or FLT3 genes. Therefore, we screened the AmL patients for known specific genetic abnormalities that could lead to more definitive prognoses.A total of 113 AML patients were evaluated at diagnosis based on routine morphology and cytochemistry and classified according to the WHO criteria. The distribution of AML subtypes was M1(1), M2(32), M3(57), M4(14), M5(1), M6(1) and seven cases where morphological subtype could not be classified. RT-PCR was performed to identify PML/RARalpha, AML1/ETO, CBFbeta/MYH11 and FLT3 nternal tandem duplication (ITD).Of the 57 patients with M3 subtype, 55 had the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript. The prevalence of bcr3 (short isoform) was higher (62%) than that of bcr1 (long isoform) (38%) and no correlation was found with age, sex or white blood cell count. FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations were more frequent in patients with APL than in other AML subtypes (17.5 vs. 8.9%), the frequency greater in patients with bcr3 isoform (70%) than in those with in bcr1 isoform (30%). Patients with FLT3/ ITD mutations had a significantly higher median white cell count than those without these mutations (55 x 10(9)/l vs. 6.3 x 10(9)/l P<0.001). More patients with FLT3/ITD mutations died early (53%) than those without these mutations (16%) (P<0.01). AML1-ETO fusion transcript was detected in 16 of 56 patients with no correlation with clinical or haematological parameters.The results of the present study showed presence of bcr3 (short isoform) higher than bcr1 (long isoform). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was predominant in acute promyelocytic leukaemia patients with bcr3 isoform. Thus, patients with APL who have FLT3 mutation appear to have a poorer prognosis. Therefore, rapid identification of specific translocations at diagnosis is important for prognostic purposes and their detection should be incorporated into routine assessment.((PMID:22983443))ERG and FLI1 are closely related members of the ETS family of transcription factors and have been identified as essential factors for the function and maintenance of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Here genome-wide analysis revealed that both ERG and FLI1 occupy similar genomic regions as AML1-ETO in t(8;21) AMLs and identified ERG/FLI1 as proteins that facilitate binding of oncofusion protein complexes. In addition, we demonstrate that ERG and FLI1 bind the RUNX1 promoter and that shRNA-mediated silencing of ERG leads to reduced expression of RUNX1 and AML1-ETO, consistent with a role of ERG in transcriptional activation of these proteins. Finally, we identify H3 acetylation as the epigenetic mark preferentially associated with ETS factor binding. This intimate connection between ERG/FLI1 binding and H3 acetylation implies that one of the molecular strategies of oncofusion proteins, such as AML1-ETO and PML-RAR-α, involves the targeting of histone deacetylase activities to ERG/FLI1 bound hematopoietic regulatory sites. Together, these results highlight the dual importance of ETS factors in t(8;21) leukemogenesis, both as transcriptional regulators of the oncofusion protein itself as well as proteins that facilitate AML1-ETO binding.((PMID:18788621))To establish a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) for quantitative detection of the common molecular markers that have affirmative clinical significance in the acute and chronic leukemia patients, and evaluate its significance in diagnosing leukemias and monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD).Primers and TaqMan probes were designed for detecting various fusion transcripts and normal abl gene was used as the internal control. The expression level of fusion transcripts in 202 newly diagnosed leukemias were determined.In absolute quantity, expression level of the fusion transcripts in various leukemias was b3a2 (b2a2) 47614.63, e1a2 98847.53, AML1-ETO 300029.51, PML-RAR alpha 25506.28, respectively, while in relative quantity to abl, the levels were 1.05, 0.91, 5.33 and 0.55, respectively.The relative quantification of gene expression level by using RQ-RT-PCR to abl control gene is more accurate and direct viewing. Different levels of transcription of corresponding fusion genes are found in various subtypes of leukemias at diagnosis, among which the level of AML1-ETO was higher and PML-RAR alpha lower.((PMID:18072623))To evaluate levels of common specific fusion transcripts M-bcr-abl, m-bcr-abl, TEL-AML1, AML1-ETO, PML-RAR alpha, CBF beta-MYH11 in untreated leukemia patients.Specific fusion transcript levels were detected by TaqMan-based real-time quantitative RT-PCR technique in a total of 208 samples, including 195 bone marrow samples from 50 M-bcr-abl(+) chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP), 10 M-bcr-abl(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 19 m-bcr-abl(+) ALL, 11 TEL-AML1(+) ALL, 30 AML1-ETO(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 58 PML-RAR alpha(+) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 17 CBF beta-MYH11(+) AML patients and 13 peripheral blood samples from 13 M-bcr-abl(+) CML-CP patients. abl was chosen as internal control gene. Fusion transcript level was calculated as fusion transcript copies/abl transcript copies in percentage.Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of CML-CP patients had similar M-bcr-abl fusion transcript levels (median 30% vs 35%, P > 0.05). M- and m-bcr-abl (median 64% vs 54%) levels were similar in ALL patients (P > 0.05), M-bcr-abl level was significantly higher in ALL than CML-CP patients(P < 0.001). Median TEL-AML1 level was 228% in ALL patients. Among AML patients, AML1-ETO level was significantly higher than CBF beta-MYH11 and PML-RAR alpha levels (median 388% vs 145%, 388% vs 47%, all P < 0.001), CBF beta-MYH11 level was significantly higher than PML-RAR alpha level (P < 0.001). Fusion transcript levels of L-, V- and S-type PML-RAR alpha were 45%, 44% and 55%, respectively. L-type was significantly lower than S-type (P = 0.04).Fusion transcript levels in untreated leukemia patients were different and patient-to-patient variations did exist. Detection of fusion transcript levels in untreated leukemia patients not only provides baseline for minimal residual disease monitoring and treatment evaluation but also enable the comparison in inter-laboratory data.((PMID:16832676))The acute promyelocytic leukemia-specific PML-RARalpha fusion protein is a dominant-negative transcriptional repressor of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target genes, which recruits HDAC and corepressor proteins and inhibits coactivators. Another oncogenic transcription factor, AML1-ETO, was proposed to cause an HDAC-dependent repression of RAR target genes. The RAR target RARbeta2 gene has been reported to be frequently silenced by hypermethylation in many types of cancer cells. We examined the methylation status of the RARbeta2 and asked if demethylation could reverse ATRA resistance in ATRA-resistant PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO-positive cells. PML-RARalpha positive NB4 and its ATRA-resistant subvariant MR2 and AML1-ETO expressing Kasumi-1 cells had heterozygous methylation of RARbeta2. Although DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially reversed RARbeta2 CpG methylation in these cells, it did not significantly enhance ATRA-induced RARbeta2 mRNA expression and induction of maturation. However, the histone acetylase inhibitor SAHA combined with ATRA significantly reactivated RARbeta2 mRNA both in NB4 and MR2 cells with degradation of PML-RARalpha, which was associated with maturation. In contrast, SAHA did not affect AML1-ETO levels and failed to induce RARbeta2 expression and maturation in Kasumi-1 cells. In primary AML samples, RARbeta2 expression was uniformly low; however, no specific correlation was observed between the methylation of the RARbeta2 gene and expression of the fusion proteins, PML-RARalpha, and AML1-ETO. These results demonstrate that oncogenic PML-RARalpha and AML1-ETO translocations are rarely associated with RARbeta2 promoter methylation in primary AML samples.((PMID:15968309))To assess the value of common fusion genes analysis in the diagnosis and classification of leukemia by multiplex RT-PCR.The multiplex RT-PCR, including 8 parallel PCR reactions, could screen 86 mRNA breakpoints or splice variants at the same time, which was important for the diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia. Bone marrow samples from 161 cases of leukemia and 8 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were involved in the study. The distribution of common fusion genes in leukemia was analyzed by the method mentioned above in combination with clinical and morphological features.Ten fusion genes were detected in 115 cases of leukemia, including AML1/ETO, PML/RAR alpha, PLZF/RAR alpha, dupMLL, MLL/AF6, MLL/AF10, CBFbeta/MYH11, BCR/ABL, Hox11, and EVI1 BCR/ABL was positive in all the 52 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia; PML/RAR alpha was found in 21 of 25 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and PLZF/RAR alpha was detected in one case of APL. Sixteen cases of 17 AML1/ETO-positive acute leukemia (AL) belonged to FAB-M2 subtype, and one case was mixed leukemia. Three of 4 AL cases carrying CBFbeta/MYH11 were M4 subtype, and one was M5 subtype. MLL aberrations were found in 16 AL, in which all MLL/AF6 translocation existed in M5 subtype with classic monoblastic characters. Furthermore, BCR/ABL was detected in 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. Fusion genes were also found in 2 MDS cases, of which AML1/ETO positive-MDS-RAEB progressed to AML rapidly.Screening of common fusion genes by multiplex RT-PCR is an important tool which could provide useful and reliable molecular genetic information for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.((PMID:15667548))((PMID:15168592))Many studies have assessed the clinical significance of the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia. Thus far, many studies have suggested that MRD detection to evaluate the response to chemotherapy is useful for predicting the prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, few studies have reported on the significance of MRD in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML), because of small numbers of patients and limited availability of MRD markers. Therefore, we monitored MRD using currently available markers at several points during the treatment for childhood AML and tried to intensify the treatment based on the results of MRD. Thirty-one patients (26 de novo cases and 5 other cases) were examined for MRD between February 1999 and May 2002. After the first consolidation therapy (consolidation 1), the expression of Wilms tumor gene (WT1) and/or leukemia-specific fusion genes such as AML1/MTG8, PML/RAR alpha, and MYH11/CBF beta were analyzed. Patients with positive MRD but in hematological remission at that point were recommended to undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT). Positive WT1 expression (more than 10(3) copies/microgram RNA) was detected in 18 of 31 patients (58.1%) at onset. After consolidation 1 therapy, the WT1 expression became negative in 14 of 18 patients. The AML1/MTG8 fusion gene was expressed in 8 patients, PML/RAR alpha was expressed in 3 patients, and MYH11/CBF beta was expressed in 1 patient. Four of the 8 patients with AML1/MTG8 expression and all 3 with PML/RAR alpha expression also demonstrated positive WT1 expression at onset. Eight (5 de novo cases and 3 other cases) of the 31 patients had no available MRD markers. Four patients who showed pesistently high expression of WT1 after consolidation 1 therapy underwent SCT, and only 1 patient remained in complete remission (CR). Among 14 patients who became negative for WT1 expression, 6 patients received SCT for various reasons. Among 8 patients with the AML1/MTG8 fusion gene, 2 became MRD negative and 6 continued to be positive. Four of these 6 patients underwent SCT, and all but one who underwent syngeneic SCT became MRD negative. On the other hand, 1 of the 2 patients who continued on chemotherapy continued to be MRD positive, suggesting a graft-versus-leukemia effect in allogeneic SCT. All patients with the PML/RAR alpha and MYH11/CBF beta fusion gene continued to be in CR. The 3-year event-free survival in de novo AML was 69.4% +/- 9.8% (n = 26), a result that is encouraging and superior to other reported outcomes. Thus, an MRD-based treatment strategy together with conventional risk factors appears to be required for further improving the outcomes of AML.((PMID:14660751))Acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs) are genetically heterogeneous and characterized by chromosomal rearrangements that produce fusion proteins with aberrant transcriptional regulatory activities. Expression of AML fusion proteins in transgenic mice increases the risk of myeloid leukemias, suggesting that they induce a preleukemic state. The underlying molecular and biological mechanisms are, however, unknown. To address this issue, we performed a systematic analysis of fusion protein transcriptional targets. We expressed AML1/ETO, PML/RAR, and PLZF/RAR in U937 hemopoietic precursor cells and measured global gene expression using oligonucleotide chips. We identified 1,555 genes regulated concordantly by at least two fusion proteins that were further validated in patient samples and finally classified according to available functional information. Strikingly, we found that AML fusion proteins induce genes involved in the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype and repress DNA repair genes, mainly of the base excision repair pathway. Functional studies confirmed that ectopic expression of fusion proteins constitutively activates pathways leading to increased stem cell renewal (e.g., the Jagged1/Notch pathway) and provokes accumulation of DNA damage. We propose that expansion of the stem cell compartment and induction of a mutator phenotype are relevant features underlying the leukemic potential of AML-associated fusion proteins.((PMID:12460926))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated chromosomal translocations result in formation of chimeric transcription factors, such as PML/RARalpha, PLZF/RARalpha, and AML-1/ETO, of which the components are involved in regulation of transcription by chromatin modeling through histone acetylation/deacetylation. The leukemic differentiation block is attributed to deregulated transcription caused by these chimeric fusion proteins, which aberrantly recruit histone-deacetylase (HDAC) activity. One essential differentiation pathway blocked by the leukemic fusion proteins is the vitamin (Vit) D(3) signaling. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which the leukemic fusion proteins interfere with VitD(3)-induced differentiation. The VitD(3)-receptor (VDR) is, like the retinoid receptors RAR, retinoid X receptor, and the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, the transcriptional activity of TR and RAR is silenced by recruitment of HDAC activity through binding to corepressors. In the presence of ligand, TR and RAR activate transcription by releasing HDAC activity and by recruiting histone-acetyltransferase activity. Here we report that VDR binds corepressors in a ligand-dependent manner and that inhibition of HDAC activity increases VitD(3) sensitivity of HL-60 cells. Nevertheless, the inhibition of HDAC activity is unable to overcome the block of VitD(3)-induced differentiation caused by PLZF/RARalpha expression. Here we demonstrate that the expression of the translocation products PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha impairs the localization of VDR in the nucleus by binding to VDR. Furthermore, the overexpression of VDR in U937 cells expressing AML-related translocation products completely abolishes the block of VitD(3)-induced differentiation. Taken together these data indicate that the AML-associated translocation products block differentiation not only by interfering with chromatin-modeling but also by sequestering factors involved in the differentiation signaling pathways, such as VDR in the VitD(3)-induced differentiation.((PMID:12145988))Mutations in signal transduction molecules, which regulate cell differentiation and proliferation, are involved in the development of leukemia. Aberrations of receptor type tyrosine kinases are known to arise from FLT3 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, and c-Kit mutations in mast cell tumors. BCR/ABL found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hallmark of the constitutively active forms of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Downstream of the tyrosine kinase is the RAS GTP-binding protein, and genetic mutations related to this protein have been found in a wide variety of malignant tumors including hematopoietic tumors. In the nucleus, transcription factor-encoding genes are frequently detected as the targets of chromosomal translocations found in specific types of leukemias. For instance, the AML1 gene generates AML1/MTG8 chimera by t (8;21) translocation in AML (M2), AML1/EVI-1 chimera by t (3;21) translocation in blastic crisis of CML, and TEL/AML1 chimera in t (12;21) translocation (pre-B cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Another example of abnormal transcription factors is PML/RAR alpha generated by t (15;17) translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Mutations or deletions of tumor suppressor genes are frequently found in cell cycle regulators such as p53, RB and p16 genes. Therefore, mutations of any molecules involved in the signal transduction pathways from growth factor receptors to inside the nucleus are thought to contribute to neoplastic transformation of hematopoietic cells.((PMID:11930660))To present a special case with the karyotype and molecular marker of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M2 who was induced to complete remission by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone.A recently hospitalized young female patient with acute leukemia was initially diagnosed as M3 subtype based on morphological French-American-British (FAB) classification. Karyotype analysis using standard G and R banding techniques and RT-PCR were applied to further define the diagnosis. After primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the iliac aspiration were tested for in vitro induced differentiation, the patient was treated with oral all-trans retinoic acid alone, 60 mg per day until complete remission was achieved. Peripheral blood and bone marrow changes were monitored over the whole treatment course.The characteristic chromosomal aberration for M3, the t(15;17) reciprocal translocation, was not found while a t(8;21) translocation was verified. Furthermore, an amplified product of the AML-1/ETO fusion gene instead of the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene was detected by RT-PCR and the diagnosis was corrected from M3 to M2. Primary cultured bone marrow cells can be fully induced to terminal differentiation after 4 days exposure to ATRA. A hematological complete remission was achieved after 40 days treatment with ATRA as a single therapeutic agent, suggesting an alternative pathway mediating ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation.A leukemia patient with a subtype other than M3, such as M2 in this case, may also be induced to complete remission by the mechanism of ATRA-induced terminal differentiation. This implies that there may be a pathway other than PML/RAR alpha fusion gene product which mediates ATRA-induced myeloid maturation in leukemia cells.((PMID:11090081))The AML-1/ETO fusion protein, created by the (8;21) translocation in M2-type acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), is a dominant repressive form of AML-1. This effect is due to the ability of the ETO portion of the protein to recruit co-repressors to promoters of AML-1 target genes. The t(11;17)(q21;q23)-associated acute promyelocytic leukemia creates the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger PLZFt/RAR alpha fusion protein and, in a similar manner, inhibits RAR alpha target gene expression and myeloid differentiation. PLZF is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and functions as a growth suppressor by repressing cyclin A2 and other targets. ETO is a corepressor for PLZF and potentiates transcriptional repression by linking PLZF to a histone deacetylase-containing complex. In transiently transfected cells and in a cell line derived from a patient with t(8;21) leukemia, PLZF and AML-1/ETO formed a tight complex. In transient assays, AML-1/ETO blocked transcriptional repression by PLZF, even at substoichiometric levels relative to PLZF. This effect was dependent on the presence of the ETO zinc finger domain, which recruits corepressors, and could not be rescued by overexpression of co-repressors that normally enhance PLZF repression. AML-1/ETO also excluded PLZF from the nuclear matrix and reduced its ability to bind to its cognate DNA-binding site. Finally, ETO interacted with PLZF/RAR alpha and enhanced its ability to repress through the RARE. These data show a link in the transcriptional pathways of M2 and M3 leukemia. (Blood. 2000;96:3939-3947)((PMID:10882117))RAR and AML1 transcription factors are found in leukemias as fusion proteins with PML and ETO, respectively. Association of PML-RAR and AML1-ETO with the nuclear corepressor (N-CoR)/histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex is required to block hematopoietic differentiation. We show that PML-RAR and AML1-ETO exist in vivo within high molecular weight (HMW) nuclear complexes, reflecting their oligomeric state. Oligomerization requires PML or ETO coiled-coil regions and is responsible for abnormal recruitment of N-CoR, transcriptional repression, and impaired differentiation of primary hematopoietic precursors. Fusion of RAR to a heterologous oligomerization domain recapitulated the properties of PML-RAR, indicating that oligomerization per se is sufficient to achieve transforming potential. These results show that oligomerization of a transcription factor, imposing an altered interaction with transcriptional coregulators, represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic activation.((PMID:10450762))((PMID:10422290))The Wilms tumor gene (WT1) has been reported to be a prognostic factor and a marker for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia. Using competitive polymerase chain reaction procedures, we examined the expression of the WT1 gene in acute leukemia patients with several tumor-specific DNA markers, including bcr/abl, PML/RAR alpha, and AML1/MTG8. A strong correlation was observed between the levels of WT1 and PML/RAR alpha expression. However, AML1/MTG8 transcripts were detected at all stages of the disease even when the expression level of WT1 gene was low. From these findings, we concluded that monitoring the WT1 expression level is a useful means of determining the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and that WT1 is an effective marker for the detection of MRD, especially in acute myeloid leukemia patients with AML1/MTG8.((PMID:9643569))Here we studied minimal residual disease (MRD) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have PML/RAR alpha or AML1/ETO as well as the phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets involved in antitumor immunity. Eight patients in long-term (LT; 3 to 15 years) and 15 patients in short-term (ST; up to 3 years) remission were studied. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT) assay, the limit of detection was 10(-5) to 10(-6) for PML/RAR alpha transcript and 10(-4) to 10(-5) for the AML1/ETO transcript. Simultaneously, T lymphocyte subsets and NK cells from the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) were investigated by flow cytometric analysis. Four of the eight patients in LT and 7 of the 15 patients in ST remission were MRD-positive. Although all MRD-positive patients in LT remission are still until now event-free, 3 of the 7 MRD-positive (MRD+) patients in ST remission soon relapsed. The total populations of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ [possible T-cell and natural killer (T/NK) populations] in the BM of ST patients and MRD+/LT patients were significantly (p < .01) low. The CD8+ CD28+ population showed the same tendency (p < .01-.02). The T/NK subsets in the BM of MRD-negative (MRD-) LT (MRD-/LT) patients showed similar numbers of cells as normal volunteers. Basically, the total percentage of the CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ cell populations in the BM was increased and in the following order: MRD-/LT patients, normal volunteers, MRD+/LT patients and MRD+ or -/ST patients. The percentages of the T/NK-cell subsets in the PB were not significantly different among these groups. Thus, the difference of the possible T/NK-cell phenotype in the BM may strongly influence clinical and molecular remission. These results still remain to be confirmed by further studies of the functional anti-tumor immunity of T/NK cells of AML in remission.((PMID:22613483))In this study, we cloned grass carp foxp3 (gcfoxp3) gene including 5' flanking region and determined its expression profiles in vivo under immunosuppressive conditions. Sequence analysis revealed that the promoter of gcfoxp3 contains AP-1, AML-1/Runx1, NF-κb and GATA-3 binding sites, which positively or negatively regulate mammalian foxp3 expression. In addition, the intron II of gcfoxp3 contains some putative binding sites including AP-1, NFAT, Smad3, RAR, CREB/ATF and FOXO1, which are corresponding to their locations in the proximal intronic enhancers of human foxp3. In an in vivo model of grass carp, an immunosuppressive agent rapamycin was showed to stimulate gcfoxp3 mRNA expression in thymus, gill, head kidney and spleen after bacterial challenge. Moreover, rapamycin increased gcFoxp3 protein levels with an additive manner in the infected fish. These findings support the involvement of fish Foxp3 in immune response and highlight a possible signaling pathway that regulates teleost Foxp3 expression.((PMID:18439490))The retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta2, and gamma regulate specific subsets of target genes during all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells. The Tie1 gene exhibited reduced expression in RA-treated F9 RARgamma-/- cells as compared to wild-type (WT) by microarray analysis. Our goal was to analyze the Tie1 gene, which encodes a surface receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in the hematovascular system.We assessed Tie1, Tie2, Flk1, Runx1, Peg/Mest2, and angiopoietin-1 and 2 mRNA levels and Tie1 promoter activity.We showed that RARgamma, but not RARalpha or RARbeta2, is required for Tie1 promoter activation by RA. Treatment with a RARgamma selective agonist plus a retinoid X receptor agonist (LGD1069) increased Tie1 mRNA levels by 11- +/- 2.5-fold 48 hours after RA addition in F9 WT, but not in F9 RARgamma-/- cells, by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Multiple putative GATA elements were identified in the Tie1 proximal promoter. RA increased GATA4 transcripts by 12- +/- 1-fold in F9 WT at 48 hours, but not in F9 RARgamma-/- cells. In addition, transfection of a GATA4 expression vector increased Tie1 promoter/luciferase activity in both RA-treated F9 WT and RARgamma-/- cells. Tie1 promoter deletion analyses indicated that a region of the promoter that possessed multiple GATA sites mediated the RA-associated Tie1 transcriptional increase.Our results indicate that GATA4 plays a role in the RA/RARgamma-associated transcriptional activation of the Tie1 promoter. An understanding of RAR specificity in RA signaling should result in insights into hematopoietic stem cell signaling and potentially in improved therapies for several human diseases.((PMID:18164278))The biological effects of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), a major active metabolite of retinol, are mainly mediated through its interactions with retinoic acid receptor (RARs alpha, beta, gamma) and retinoid X receptor (RXRs alpha, beta, gamma) heterodimers. RAR/RXR heterodimers activate transcription by binding to RA-response elements (RAREs or RXREs) in the promoters of primary target genes. Murine F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells have been widely used as a model for cellular differentiation and RA signaling during embryonic development. We identified and characterized genes that are differentially expressed in F9 wild type (Wt) and F9 RARgamma-/- cells, with and without RA treatment, through the use of oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Our data indicate that RARgamma, in the absence of exogenous RA, modulates gene expression. Genes such as Sfrp2, Tie1, Fbp2, Emp1, and Emp3 exhibited higher transcript levels in RA-treated Wt, RARalpha-/- and RARbeta2-/- lines than in RA-treated RARgamma-/- cells, and represent specific RARgamma targets. Other genes, such as Runx1, were expressed at lower levels in both F9 RARbeta2-/- and RARgamma-/- cell lines than in F9 Wt and RARalpha-/-. Genes specifically induced by RA at 6h with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in F9 Wt, but not in RARgamma-/- cells, included Hoxa3, Hoxa5, Gas1, Cyp26a1, Sfrp2, Fbp2, and Emp1. These genes represent specific primary RARgamma targets in F9 cells. Several genes in the Wnt signaling pathway were regulated by RARgamma. Delineation of the receptor-specific actions of RA with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation should result in more effective therapies with this drug.((PMID:20010624))Terminal differentiation of blood cells requires the concerted action of a series of transcription factors that are expressed at specific stages of maturation and function in a cell-type and dosage-dependent manner. Leukemogenic oncoproteins block differentiation by subverting the normal transcriptional status of hematopoietic precursor cells. Pirin (PIR) is a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression is silenced in cells bearing the acute myeloid leukemia-1 eight-twenty-one (AML1/ETO) and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR) leukemogenic fusion proteins. A role for PIR in myeloid differentiation has not to date been reported. In this study we show that PIR expression is significantly repressed in a large proportion of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), regardless of subtype or underlying karyotypic abnormalities. We show that PIR expression increases during in vitro myeloid differentiation of primary hematopoietic precursor cells, and that ablation of PIR in the U937 myelomonocytic cell line or in murine primary hematopoietic precursor cells results in impairment of terminal myeloid differentiation. Gene expression profiling of U937 cells after knockdown of PIR revealed increased expression of genes associated with the early phases of hematopoiesis, in particular, homeobox A (HOXA) genes. Our results suggest that PIR is required for terminal myeloid maturation, and its downregulation may contribute to the differentiation arrest associated with AML.((PMID:19317219))A number of molecular targets have been identified in leukemia, based on the understanding of signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and malignant transformation. Growth factors and integrins interact with their receptors and activate signaling cascades with intimate interconnections. The specific niches within the bone marrow microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of leukemic cells to escape chemotherapy-induced death and acquire drug resistance. Investigations into bone marrow stroma-leukemia crosstalk may result in the development of strategies against the acquisition of a chemo-resistant phenotype and enhance the efficacy of therapies in leukemia. In recent studies, we proposed novel therapeutic interventions targeting the microenvironment/leukemia interaction focusing on SDF1/CXCR4, ILK/PI3K/Akt, TGF-beta, and Notch signaling. Gene transcriptional activity is regulated by chromatin modification and DNA methylation. Nuclear receptors such as RAR, RXR, and PPARgamma exert histone acetyl transferase activity (HAT). The transcription of target genes is initiated following the ligation of these receptors, recruitment of co-activators, and replacement of repressors. We demonstrated that histone acetylation by the PPARgamma agonist CDDO, RAR/RXR agonist ATRA, and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) reversed the silenced RARbeta and MDR1 genes in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that HDACI induced apoptosis with phagocytosis through the induction of Annexin A1 in AML1/ETO-positive acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells. The translation of research findings into effective clinical laboratory tests is an important approach. The flow cytometric technique is a powerful tool in the field of clinical laboratory medicine, with its accurate and rapid analysis. We carried out phospho-specific flow cytometry to investigate protein phosphorylation in AML cells and detect ZAP-70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, including the evaluation of antibodies, staining epitopes, fixing and permeabilizing methods, and analyzing systems. Finally, we emphasize the potential applications of research findings and methods in the fields of clinical medicine, molecular diagnosis, and targeting therapy.((PMID:19035174))To investigate the expression level of preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) mRNA in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and evaluate its usefulness for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD).PRAME mRNA levels were detected in bone marrow samples from 142 newly diagnosed AML patients (72 of them didn't express any specific fusion gene) by TaqMan based real-time quantitative PCR methods, and were serially monitored in 60 bone marrow samples from 9 follow-up patients (2 of them without specific fusion gene), including 3 in continuous complete remission, 6 in hematological relapse. Bone marrow samples from 22 bone marrow donors (NBM) were served as normal controls. Samples from 7 AML1-ETO (+) M2 patients were detected for AML1-ETO mRNA simultaneously. abl was selected as control gene, PRAME and AML1-ETO mRNA levels were expressed by their copies/abl copies in percentage.All NBM samples expressed PRAME mRNA and the upper limit was 0.28%. For all newly diagnosed AML patients, median PRAME mRNA level was 3.97% (0.00%-714.97%), 76.8% of them was higher than 0.28%, 54.9% had over 1-log increasing and 26.1% had over 2-log increasing. For patients without specific fusion gene, median PRAME mRNA level was 0.60% (0.00%-408.72%), 56.3% of them was over 0.28%, 32.4% and 11.3% had over 1-log and 2-log increasing, respectively. There was a significant difference in PRAME mRNA levels between subtypes of AML patients (P<0.01). AML1-ETO (+) M2 patients expressed the highest levels (all P<0.01), followed by acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with S type PML-RAR alpha fusion gene. PRAME and AML1-ETO mRNA levels of follow up patients displayed similar kinetic patterns, and correlated well in 43 follow up samples (r=0.88, P<0.01). PRAME mRNA levels in 3 hematological relapsed patients increased above 0.28% 1-4 months ahead relapse, and in other 3 relapsed patients the levels never decreased to normal range even in remission.PRAME mRNA could be used to monitor MRD for AML patients with higher than normal levels, and it increases over or persistently higher than normal range predicts hematological relapse.((PMID:18445043))Basophilic crisis and eosinophilia are well recognized features of advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia. In other myeloid neoplasms, however, transformation with marked basophilia and eosinophilia is considered unusual.We examined the long-term follow-up of 322 patients with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to define the frequency of basophilic, eosinophilic and mixed lineage (basophilic and eosinophilic) transformation.Of all patients, only one developed mixed lineage crisis (>or= 20% basophils and >or= 20% eosinophils). In this patient, who initially suffered from chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, basophils increased to 48% and eosinophils up to 31% at the time of progression. Mixed lineage crisis was not accompanied by an increase in blast cells or organomegaly. The presence of BCR/ABL and other relevant fusion gene products (FIP1L1/PDGFRA, AML1/ETO, PML/RAR alpha, CBF beta/MYH11) were excluded by PCR. Myelomastocytic transformation/myelomastocytic leukaemia and primary mast cell disease were excluded by histology, KIT mutation analysis, electron microscopy and immunophenotyping. Basophils were thus found to be CD123+, CD203c+, BB1+, KIT- cells, and to express a functional IgE-receptor. Among the other patients with MDS examined, 4(1.2%) were found to have marked basophilia (>or= 20%) and 7(2.1%) were found to have massive eosinophilia ( >or= 20%), whereas mixed-lineage crisis was detected in none of them.Mixed basophil/eosinophil crisis may develop in patients with MDS but is an extremely rare event.((PMID:15908787))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription and specific functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer. Inhibitors of HDACs (HDACI) possess anti-tumor activity and are well tolerated, suggesting that they might develop into a specific strategy for cancer treatment. Indeed, HDACIs have successfully entered clinical trials, but the molecular basis for their selective anti-tumor activities is not clear. Recent work on leukemias expressing the PML-RAR or AML1-ETO oncogenes, known to initiate leukemogenesis through deregulation of HDACs, shows that HDACIs induce massive blast-cell apoptosis. Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic activity of the drug is not due to the relief of oncogene-mediated inhibition of the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway but, instead, relies on the selective upregulation of the death receptors DR5 and Fas and their cognate ligands TRAIL and FasL. Significantly, normal myeloid progenitors are not sensitive to HDACI-induced apoptosis and oncogene expression is not sufficient to confer HDACI-sensitivity to normal cells, demonstrating that sensitivity to HDACI is a property of the fully transformed phenotype. In principle, our findings could thus apply to other cancers, where the contribution of HDACs to tumorigenesis is not yet defined.((PMID:15748426))In the last twenty years, using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as a differentiation inducer, Shanghai Institute of Hematology has achieved an important breakthrough in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which realized the theory of reversing phenotype of cells and provided a successful model of differentiation therapy in cancers. Our group first discovered in the world the variant chromosome translocation t(11;17)(q23;q21) of APL, and cloned the PML-RAR alpha, PLZF-RAR alpha and NPM-RAR alpha fusion genes corresponding to the characterized chromosome translocations t(15;17); t(11;17) and t(5;17) in APL. Moreover, establishment of transgenic mice model of APL proved their effects on leukemogenesis. The ability of ATRA to modify the recruitment of nuclear receptor co-repressor with PML-RAR alpha but not PLZF-RAR alpha caused by the variant chromosome translocation elucidated the therapeutic mechanism of ATRA from the molecular level and provides new insight into transcription-modulating therapy. Since 1994, our group has successfully applied arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) in treating relapsed APL patients, with the complete remission rate of 70% - 80%. The molecular mechanism study revealed that As(2)O(3) exerts a dose-dependent dual effect on APL. Low-dose As(2)O(3) induced partial differentiation of APL cells, while the higher dose induced apoptosis. As(2)O(3) binds ubiquitin like SUMO-1 through the lysine 160 of PML, resulting in the degradation of PML-RAR alpha. Taken together, ATRA and As(2)O(3) target the transcription factor PML-RAR alpha, the former by retinoic acid receptor and the latter by PML sumolization, both induce PML-RAR alpha degradation and APL cells differentiation and apoptosis. Because of the different acting pathways, ATRA and As(2)O(3) have no cross-resistance and can be used as combination therapy. Clinical trial in newly diagnosed APL patients showed that ATRA/As(2)O(3) in combination yields a longer disease-free survival time. With the median survival of 18 months, none of the 20 cases in combination treatment relapsed, whereas 7 relapsed in 37 cases in mono-treatment. This is the best clinical effect achieved in treating adult acute leukemia to this day, possibly making APL the first adult curable leukemia. Based on the great success of the pathogenetic gene target therapy in APL, this strategy may extend to other leukemias. Combination of Gleevec and arsenic agents in treating chronic myeloid leukemia has already make a figure both in clinical and laboratory research, aiming at counteracting the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and the degradating BCR-ABL fusion protein. In acute myeloid leukemia M(2b), using new target therapy degradating AML1-ETO fusion protein and reducing the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit will also lead to new therapeutic management in acute leukemias.((PMID:15619634))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate transcription and specific cellular functions, such as tumor suppression by p53, and are frequently altered in cancer. Inhibitors of HDACs (HDACIs) possess antitumor activity and are well tolerated, supporting the idea that their use might develop as a specific strategy for cancer treatment. The molecular basis for their selective antitumor activity is, however, unknown. We investigated the effects of HDACIs on leukemias expressing the PML-RAR or AML1-ETO oncoproteins, known to initiate leukemogenesis through deregulation of HDACs. Here we report that: (i) HDACIs induce apoptosis of leukemic blasts, although oncogene expression is not sufficient to confer HDACI sensitivity to normal cells; (ii) apoptosis is p53 independent and depends, both in vitro and in vivo, upon activation of the death receptor pathway (TRAIL and Fas signaling pathways); (iii) TRAIL, DR5, FasL and Fas are upregulated by HDACIs in the leukemic cells, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. These results show that sensitivity to HDACIs in leukemias is a property of the fully transformed phenotype and depends on activation of a specific death pathway.((PMID:12872151))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is becoming popular in the diagnosis of clonal chromosomal abnormalities. We set up a fast FISH procedure using an extensive set of specific probes. Conventional banding analysis (CBA) and FISH were compared in 260 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. For FISH the following probes were used: MLL, CBF-beta/MYH11, ETV-6/AML1; AML1/ETO, BCR/ABL, PML/RAR, c-MYC, TP53, RB1, 5q31/5p15.2, 5q33-34, 7q31/CEP7, 20q13; CEP 4, X, Y. Result time was 96 h for CBA versus 5 h for FISH from direct harvest. CBA showed clonal abnormalities in 41% (n=105/260), normal karyotype in 39% (n=102/260) and failed in 20% (n=53/260). FISH screened all patients and detected abnormalities in 39% (n=102/260); CBA and FISH together identified abnormalities in 49% (n=128/260). In six patients with normal CBA and in eight patients with clonal karyotype, it detected further cryptic abnormalities. CBA showed clonal abnormalities in 13% of patients negative at FISH (n=21/158). FISH screening does not add relevant information to CBA, but is the quickest method for detecting major genetic abnormalities in AML. The speed of FISH is very valuable in AML-M3/M3v because PML/RAR+ patients require specific therapy. Furthermore, we suggest FISH screening in failed, complex or suboptimal quality chromosome and specific FISH analysis for 5q, 7q, 12p, 17p, inv(16), t(11q23) in order to implement CBA accuracy.((PMID:15809276))The leukaemias, which are divided into chronic and acute forms, are malignant diseases of haematopoietic cells in which the proper balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis is no longer operative. Genes, such as those of mixed-lineage leukaemia, AML1 and retinoic acid receptor alpha, have been found to be aberrantly fused to different partners, which often encode transcription factors or other chromatin modifying enzymes, in numerous types of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias. These chimeric fusion oncoproteins, generated by reciprocal chromosomal translocations, are responsible for chromatin alterations on target genes whose expression is critical to stem cell development or lineage specification in haematopoiesis. Alterations in the 'histone code' or in the DNA methylation content occur as consequence of aberrant targeting of the corresponding enzymatic activities. Here, the author will review the most recent progress in the field, focusing on how fusion proteins generated by chromosomal translocation are responsible for chromatin alterations, gene deregulation and haematopoietic differentiation block and their implication for clinical treatment.((PMID:15024077))The acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated translocation products AML1-ETO, PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), and PLZF-RARalpha encode aberrant transcription factors. Several lines of evidence suggest similar pathogenetic mechanisms for these fusion proteins. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify shared target genes in inducibly transfected U937 cells expressing AML1-ETO, PML-RARalpha, or PLZF-RARalpha. All three fusion proteins significantly repressed the expression of 38 genes and induced the expression of 14 genes. Several of the regulated genes were associated with Wnt signaling. One of these, plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), was induced on the mRNA and protein level by all three fusion proteins. In addition, primary AML blasts carrying one of the fusion proteins significantly overexpressed plakoglobin. The plakoglobin promoter was cloned and shown to be induced by AML1-ETO, with promoter activation depending on the corepressor and histone deacetylase binding domains. The induction of plakoglobin by AML fusion proteins led to downstream signaling and transactivation of TCF- and LEF-dependent promoters, including the c-myc promoter, which was found to be bound by plakoglobin in vivo after AML1-ETO expression. beta-Catenin protein levels and TCF and LEF target genes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 were found to be induced by the fusion proteins. On the functional level, a dominant negative TCF inhibited colony growth of AML1-ETO-positive Kasumi cells, whereas plakoglobin transfection into myeloid 32D cells enhanced proliferation and clonal growth. Injection of plakoglobin-expressing 32D cells into syngeneic mice accelerated the development of leukemia. Transduction of plakoglobin into primitive murine hematopoietic progenitor cells preserved the immature phenotype during colony growth, suggesting enhanced self-renewal. These data provide evidence that activation of Wnt signaling is a common feature of several balanced translocations in AML.((PMID:10221524))We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia FAB-type 2 with a translocation t(15;17)(q22;q12) On the basis of the cytological findings, a translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22) was suspected. FISH analyses using specific probes for t(15;17) and t(8;21) detected both PML/RARalpha and AML1/ETO rearrangements in a few percentage of cells. This case demonstrates the complexities that may occur between cytology and cytogenetic findings and the usefulness of FISH methods to detect an AML1/ETO rearrangement only suspected by cytological examination of bone marrow smears.((PMID:20804918))Oncogene amplification resulting in aberrant expression, although common in solid tumors, is rare in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is mostly associated with amplification of MYC, RUNX1, and MLL genes. Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and other target sequences at 17p11.2 often represent the amplicons expressed in breast cancer, not in AML. We present a unique case of a 59-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, now presenting with pancytopenia and bilateral infiltration with effusion in nodules of the right upper lobe of the lung. She was diagnosed with AML-M5. Chromosome analysis demonstrated a hypodiploid clone with complex numerical/structural abnormalities including 5q deletion, monosomy 7, as well as structurally rearranged chromosome 11 and several marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed amplification of RARA, loss of 7q, monosomy 7, loss of DEK (6p23), and additional copies of NUP214 (9q34) and MLL (11q23). Additional FISH studies showed both ERBB2 and TOP2A genes, which were co-amplified on one of the marker chromosomes. The follow-up bone marrow did not yield any metaphases, but FISH was normal for all probes, including RARA. After a short remission, the patient relapsed and showed clonal evolution. Additional case reports are necessary to assess whether RARA amplification in hematologic malignancies serves as an independent prognostic factor.((PMID:18264136))The use of genetically engineered mice (GEM) have been critical in understanding disease states such as cancer, and none more so than acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), a disease characterized by over 100 distinct chromosomal translocations. A substantial proportion of cases exhibiting recurrent reciprocal translocations at diagnosis, such as t(8;21) or t(15;17) have been exhaustively studied and are currently employed in clinical diagnosis. However, a definitive conclusion regarding the leukaemogenic potential of defined transgenes for this disease remains elusive. While it is increasingly apparent that a number of cooperating mutations are necessary to develop a leukaemic phenotype, the number of models reflecting these synergisms remains few. Furthermore, little emphasis has been paid to the effect of chromosomal translocations other than recurrent genetic abnormalities, with no models reflecting the multiple abnormalities observed in high-risk cases of AML accounting for 8-10% of adult AML. Here we review the differing technologies employed in generation of GEM of AML. We discuss the relevance of GEM AML from embryonic stem cell-mediated (for example retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusions and AML1/ETO) models; through to the valuable retroviral-mediated gene transfer models. The latter have been used to great effect in defining the transforming properties of chromosomal translocation products such as MLL (found in 5-6% of all AML cases) and NUP98 (denoting poor prognosis in therapy-related disease) and particularly when co-transduced with bad prognostic factors such as Flt3 mutations. Finally, we comment on the emergence of newer transduction technologies, which can regulate the level of expression to defined cell lineages in both primary murine and human xenografts, and discuss how combining multiple genetic modalities, more relevant models of this complex disease are being generated.((PMID:17361223))PU.1, a transcription factor of the ETS family, plays a pivotal role in normal hematopoiesis, and particularly in myeloid differentiation. Altered PU.1 function is possibly implicated in leukemogenesis, as PU.1 gene mutations were identified in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and as several oncogenic products (AML1-ETO, promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha, FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication) are associated with PU.1 downregulation. To demonstrate directly a role of PU.1 in the blocked differentiation of leukemic blasts, we transduced cells from myeloid cell lines and primary blasts from AML patients with a lentivector encoding PU.1. In NB4 cells we obtained increases in PU.1 mRNA and protein, comparable to increases obtained with all-trans retinoic acid-stimulation. Transduced cells showed increased myelomonocytic surface antigen expression, decreased proliferation rates and increased apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in primary AML blasts from 12 patients. These phenotypic changes are characteristic of restored blast differentiation. PU.1 should therefore constitute an interesting target for therapeutic intervention in AML.((PMID:16581786))MEF is an ETS-related transcription factor with strong transcriptional activating activity that affects hematopoietic stem cell behavior and is required for normal NK cell and NK T-cell development. The MEF (also known as ELF4) gene is repressed by several leukemia-associated fusion transcription factor proteins (PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha and AML1-ETO), but it is also activated by retroviral insertion in several cancer models. We have previously shown that cyclin A-dependent phosphorylation of MEF largely restricts its activity to the G(1) phase of the cell cycle; we now show that MEF is a short-lived protein whose expression level also peaks during late G(1) phase. Mutagenesis studies show that the rapid turnover of MEF in S phase is dependent on the specific phosphorylation of threonine 643 and serine 648 at the C terminus of MEF by cdk2 and on the Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(Skp2), which targets MEF for ubiquitination and proteolysis. Overexpression of MEF drives cells through the G(1)/S transition, thereby promoting cell proliferation. The tight regulation of MEF levels during the cell cycle contributes to its effects on regulating cell cycle entry and cell proliferation.((PMID:14523474))Cellular and systemic O(2) concentrations are tightly regulated to maintain delicate oxygen homeostasis. Although the roles of hypoxia in solid tumors have been widely studied, few studies were reported regarding the possible effects of hypoxia on leukemic cells. Here, we showed for the first time that low concentrations of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), a hypoxia-mimicking agent, and 2-3% O(2) triggered differentiation of various subtypes of human acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cell lines, including NB4, U937 and Kasumi-1 cells, respectively, from M3, M5 and M2b-type AML, but CoCl(2) did not modulate AML subtype-specific fusion proteins promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) and AML1-ETO. Treatment with CoCl(2) also induced primary leukemic cells from some AML patients to undergo differentiation. Similar to what occurs in solid tumor cells, CoCl(2)-mimicked hypoxia also increased the level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein and its DNA-binding activity in leukemic cells. The CoCl(2) induction of HIF-1alpha protein and its DNA-binding activity were inhibited by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, which also blocked CoCl(2)-induced cell differentiation in leukemic cells. These results provide an insight into a possible link of hypoxia or HIF-1alpha and leukemic cell differentiation, and are possibly of significance to explore clinical potentials of hypoxia or hypoxia-mimicking agents and novel target-based drugs for differentiation therapy of leukemia.((PMID:10419474))AML2 is a member of the acute myelogenous leukemia, AML family of transcription factors. The biologic functions of AML1 and AML3 have been well characterized; however, the functional role of AML2 remains unknown. In this study, we found that AML2 protein expressed predominantly in cells of hematopoietic origin is a nuclear serine phosphoprotein associated with the nuclear matrix, and its expression is not cell cycle-related. In HL-60 cells AML2 expression can be induced by all three natural retinoids, all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 13-cis-RA, and 9-cis-RA in a dose-dependent manner. A synthetic retinoic acid derivative, 4HPR, which neither activates RA receptor (RAR) alpha nor retinoic X receptor alpha was unable to induce the expression of AML2. A RAR-selective activator, TTNPB, induced AML2 expression similar to RA. Our study further showed that AGN193109, a potent RARalpha antagonist, suppressed AML2 expression induced by RA and that a retinoic X receptor pan agonist AGN194204 had no effect on its expression. Taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrated that the expression of AML2 in HL-60 cells is regulated through the RARalpha-specific signaling pathway. Our study further showed that after all-trans-retinoic acid priming, AML2 expression could be augmented by vitamin D(3). Based on these studies we hypothesize that AML2 expression is normally regulated by retinoid/vitamin D nuclear receptors mainly through the RARalpha-dependent signaling pathway and that it may play a role in hematopoietic cell differentiation.((PMID:7949179))The WT1 gene encoding a zinc finger polypeptide is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a key role in the carcinogenesis of Wilms' tumor. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine relative levels of WT1 gene expression (defined in K562 cells as 1.00) in 45 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 22 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 6 with acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL), 23 with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 24 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Significant levels of WT1 gene were expressed in all leukemia patients and for CML the levels increased as the clinical phase progressed. In striking contrast with acute leukemia, the levels of WT1 gene expression for NHL were significantly lower or even undetectable. Clear correlation was observed between the relative levels of WT1 gene expression (< 0.6 v > or = 0.6) and the prognosis for acute leukemia (AML, ALL, and AMLL). Patients with less than 0.6 levels had significantly higher rates of complete remission (CR), disease-free survival, and overall survival than those with > or = 0.6 levels, whereas CR could not be induced in any of the 7 patients with acute leukemia having greater than 1.0 levels of WT1 gene expression. The quantitation of the WT1 gene expression made it possible to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia regardless of the presence or absence of tumor-specific DNA markers. Continuous monitoring of the WT1 mRNA was performed for 9 patients with acute leukemia. In 4 patients, MRD was detected 2 to 8 months before clinical relapse became apparent. In 2 other patients, the WT1 mRNA gradually increased after discontinuation of chemotherapy. No MRD was detected in the remaining 3 patients with AML who received intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Simultaneous monitoring of MRD by RT-PCR using primers for specific DNA markers in 3 patients (2 AML-M3 with PML/RAR alpha, and 1 AML-M2 with AML1/ETO) among these 9 patients detected MRD comparable with that obtained from quantitation of WT1 gene expression. In a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, the limits of leukemic cell detection by RT-PCR using either WT1 or promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene primers were 10(-3) to 10(-4) and 10(-4) for bone marrow, and 10(-5) and 10(-4) for peripheral blood, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that WT1 is a new prognostic factor and a new marker for the detection of MRD in acute leukemia.((PMID:25996952))The adapter protein metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) is implicated as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter, depending on the type of solid cancer. Here, we identified Mtss1 expression to be increased in AML subsets with favorable outcome, while suppressed in high risk AML patients. High expression of MTSS1 predicted better clinical outcome of patients with normal-karyotype AML. Mechanistically, MTSS1 expression was negatively regulated by FLT3-ITD signaling but enhanced by the AML1-ETO fusion protein. DNMT3B, a negative regulator of MTSS1, showed strong binding to the MTSS1 promoter in PML-RARA positive but not AML1-ETO positive cells, suggesting that AML1-ETO leads to derepression of MTSS1. Pharmacological treatment of AML cell lines carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation with the specific FLT3 inhibitor PKC-412 caused upregulation of MTSS1. Moreover, treatment of acute promyelocytic cells (APL) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) increased MTSS1 mRNA levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that MTSS1 might have a context-dependent function and could act as a tumor suppressor, which is pharmacologically targetable in AML patients.((PMID:20861459))Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a highly curable disease with excellent complete remission and long-term survival rates. However, the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) is being reported with increasing frequency in patients successfully treated for APL. We attempted to clarify the different clinical features and hematologic findings between t-MN and relapse cases, and to identify gene alterations involved in t-MN. We compared 10 relapse and 11 t-MN cases that developed in 108 patients during their first complete remission from APL. At APL diagnosis, t-MN patients had lower white blood cell counts than did relapse patients (P = .048). Overall survival starting from chemotherapy was significantly worse in t-MN patients than in relapse patients (P = .022). The t-MN cases were characterized as CD34(+)/HLA-DR(+) and PML-RARA(-), and 4 RUNX1/AML1 mutations were detected. T-MN is easily distinguished from APL relapse by evaluating these hematologic features, and it may originate from primitive myeloid cells by chemotherapy-induced RUNX1 mutations.((PMID:19860185))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of tumor cells that arise from the hematopoietic stem/progenitor population within the bone marrow. Cytogenetic abnormalities or point mutations of the hematopoiesis-specific genes are frequently found in patients with AML, and these genetic aberrations are closely associated with the pathophysiology of the disease. Molecular pathogenesis of AML has been disclosed through analyses of such gene aberrations, including AML1 and MLL abnormalities, PML-RARA chimeric gene, activating mutations of FLT3, and EVI-1 abnormalities. Through prediction of prognosis and targeted therapy, this knowledge on pathogenesis of AML has been applied to the clinical practice, and further investigation should improve the outcome of therapy for AML in the future.((PMID:19027486))Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that is characterized by peculiar clinical and biologic features, including severe hemorrhagic diathesis, specific recurrent chromosomal aberration, and distinct morphologic features with predominant pathologic promyelocytes. A reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17)(q22;q21), is a characteristic feature of APL that represents approximately 5-8% of AML. The rearranged gene created by this translocation encodes a chimeric protein PML-RARA that is a transcriptional repressor. In contrast to other AML subtypes, APL is particularly sensitive to treatment with all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with chemotherapy, converting this once fatal leukemia to a highly curable disease. Nonetheless, therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome-acute myelogenous leukemia (t-MDS/AML) has been reported as a rare complication of chemotherapy in APL. Of 30 APL cases described as t-MDS/AML in the literature, only 1 case relapsed as acute leukemia with t(3;21)(q26;q22). Here we describe a rare case of APL relapsing as secondary AML with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and clinically characterize this patient using the RUNX1 (previously AML1)-MDS1-EVI1 fusion transcript (with follow-up for 55 months), and review the relevant literature.((PMID:17556074))Submicroscopic deletions of genes in recurrent chromosomal rearrangements occur frequently in hematologic malignancies, but their incidences have not been reported clearly. We investigated the incidence of submicroscopic deletions and their association with specific genetic rearrangements in various hematologic malignancies. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study was conducted in 336 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 223 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and 79 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The incidence of submicroscopic deletions in patients with chromosomal rearrangements was the highest in the TEL/AML1 rearrangement (65.0%), followed by BCR/ABL (10.9%), MLL (5.6%), AML/ETO (4.0%), and PML/RARA (0.0%). Submicroscopic deletion was quite common, and incidences were variable according to disease entities and chromosomal translocations. To detect submicroscopic deletions, careful FISH study should be included for the cytogenetic study of hematologic malignancies, and their association with clinical prognosis needs to be further studied.((PMID:17251199))We report the first dry-reagent, disposable, dipstick test for molecular screening of seven chromosomal translocations associated with acute and chronic leukemia. The dipstick assay offers about 10 times higher detectability than agarose gel electrophoresis and, contrary to electrophoresis, allows confirmation of the sequence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product by hybridization within a few minutes without the need of instrumentation. Biotinylated amplified DNA is hybridized with a dA-tailed probe and applied to the strip, which contains oligo(dT)-conjugated gold nanoparticles in dry form. Upon immersion of the strip in the appropriate buffer, the solution migrates and the hybrids are captured by immobilized streptavidin at the test zone generating a characteristic red line. The excess nanoparticles are captured by oligo(dA) strands immobilized at the control zone of the strip producing a second red line. We studied the: t(9;22)(q34;q11), t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(11;17)(q23;q21), t(5;17)(q32;q21), t(11;17)(q13;q21), t(8,21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13;q22) that generate the BCR-ABL, PML-RARa, PLZF-RARa, NPM-RARa, NuMA-RARa, AML1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion genes, respectively. A single K562 cell was detectable amidst 10(6) normal leukocytes. A dipstick test was developed for actin, as a reference gene. The dipstick assay with appropriate probes can be used for identification of the fusion transcripts involved in the translocation.((PMID:16140925))AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME) is a chimeric transcription factor produced by the (3;21)(q26;q22) translocation. This chromosomal translocation is associated with de novo and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and with the blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. AME is obtained by in-frame fusion of the AML1 and MDS1/EVI1 (ME) genes. The mechanisms by which AME induces a neoplastic transformation in bone marrow cells are unknown. AME interacts with the corepressors CtBP and HDAC1, and it was shown that AME is a repressor in contrast to the parent transcription factors AML1 and ME, which are transcription activators. Studies with murine bone marrow progenitors indicated that the introduction of a point mutation that destroys the CtBP-binding consensus impairs but does not abolish the disruption of cell differentiation and replication associated with AME expression, suggesting that additional events are required. Several chimeric proteins, such as AML1/ETO, BCR/ABL, and PML/RARa, are characterized by the presence of a self-interaction domain critical for transformation. We report that AME is also able to oligomerize and displays a complex pattern of self-interaction that involves at least three oligomerization regions, one of which is the distal zinc finger domain. Although the deletion of this short domain does not preclude the self-interaction of AME, it significantly reduces the differentiation defects caused in vitro by AME in primary murine bone marrow progenitors. The addition of a point mutation that inhibits CtBP binding completely abrogates the effects of AME on differentiation, suggesting that AME induces hematopoietic differentiation defects through at least two separate but cooperating pathways.((PMID:15193435))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can detect minor genetic changes that cytogenetic analysis may miss; however, there are few reports on the kinds of genetic changes that show large discrepancies between results obtained with FISH versus G-banding techniques. To investigate genetic changes that tend to be detected with FISH only, we compared the results of cytogenetic study and FISH analysis in 919 consecutive specimens from 304 patients with hematologic malignancies, covering most of the frequent genetic changes by using 18 types of FISH probes. The genetic changes with especially large discrepancy rates at diagnosis were del(7q) (20.0%), PML/RARA (17.6%), and trisomy 21 (12.5%) and, at follow-up, BCR/ABL (28.2%) and AML1/ETO (24.4%); the latter two showed only small discrepancies at diagnosis (4.7 and 4.8%, respectively). The overall discrepancy rate was 6.0% at diagnosis and 11.9% at follow-up, indicating generally greater discrepancy rates at follow-up. In all but one of the cases with discrepant results, G-banding missed the corresponding chromosomal abnormalities revealed with FISH. Considered by type of leukemia, the discrepancy rate at follow-up was higher in acute biphenoptypic leukemia (38%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24.5%) than in acute myelogenous leukemia (10.6%). Given these results, all patients with known genetic changes should have FISH analysis in follow-up, for an accurate assessment of the likelihood of complete remission or recurrence. If this is not practical, then at a minimum FISH analysis should be done in follow-up for patients with genetic changes of BCR/ABL and AML1/ETO seen at diagnosis.((PMID:12842988))To evaluate the prognostic significance of quantitative PML-RARA, AML1-ETO, and CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcript expression, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze bone marrow samples of 349 such patients at diagnosis and 522 samples of 142 patients also during therapy (total analyses, n = 859; median number of follow-up samples, 4/patient; median duration of assessment, 12 months). Lower expression levels at diagnosis correlated with better overall and event-free survival in all 3 leukemia subtypes. By combining the median expression ratio after consolidation therapy and the 75th percentile of the expression ratio at diagnosis, a new score was established that separates a group with 100% EFS from a significantly worse group (P <.0001) in each of the 3 acute myeloid leukemia subgroups. Eight patients showed increasing levels of expression during follow-up and all had relapse. In conclusion, patients at high risk for treatment failure can be identified by high levels of fusion gene expression at diagnosis or less than 3 logs of tumor reduction during the first 3 to 4 months of therapy. By combining the transcription ratios at these 2 checkpoints, a new powerful prognostic score has been established.((PMID:12699896))Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was carried out in five patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia of various French-American-British subtypes and with double trisomy of chromosomes 8 and 21. PML-RARA fusion was detected with appropriate molecular probes in one patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia without t(15;17). Two PAC probes covering the 5' and 3' part of the RUNX1 gene were used in the four other patients. While three copies were present in three patients, as expected from conventional karyotype analysis, only two hybridization signals were present in the fifth patient. This was due to the apparent loss of the 3' part of RUNX1. Since chromosome number abnormalities may be associated with submicroscopic gene rearrangements, it should be important to search for them for a better understanding of mechanisms of leukemogenesis, and to understand the prognostic heterogeneity in leukemic patients with aneusomies without apparent chromosome structure rearrangements.((PMID:11753612))T(8;21) AML1(CBFA2)-ETO(MTG8) is the most common chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in both children and adults. We sought to understand the structure and gain insight into the fusion process between AML1 and ETO by sequencing genomic fusions in 17 primary childhood AMLs and two cell lines with t(8;21). Reciprocal translocations were sequenced for seven of the 19 samples. We assumed a null hypothesis that the translocation breakpoints would be evenly distributed along the intronic breakpoint cluster regions. Testing for multimodality via smoothed bootstrap statistical methods suggested, however, the presence of two separate cluster regions within both the AML1 and ETO breakpoint cluster regions. ETObreakpoints were predominantly located in intron 1B in a defined cluster 5' of exon 1A (scan statistic P value = 0.00001). All patients with available RNA expressed an AML1-ETO mRNA fusion between exon 5 of AML1 and exon 2 of ETO. Since the structural restraints for the fusion protein of AML1-ETO exclude exon 1A, we reason that ETO intron 1B harbors a structural feature with propensity for breakage and/or recombination. Chromosomal breakpoints displayed evidence of fusion by a non-homologous end joining process, with microhomologies and nontemplate nucleotides at some fusion junctions. Breakpoints in general displayed similar complexity of duplications, deletions, and insertions to other common pediatric leukemia translocations (TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, PML-RARA, CBFB-MYH11) that we and others have analyzed.((PMID:26871368))The new World Health Organization's (WHO) classification of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms incorporating the recurrent fusion genes as the defining criteria for different haematopoietic malignant phenotypes is reviewed. The recurrent fusion genes incorporated in the new WHO's classification and other chromosomal rearrangements of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue neoplasms are reviewed.Cytokines and transcription factors in haematopoiesis and leukaemic mechanisms are described. Genetic features and clinical implications due to the encoded chimeric neoproteins causing malignant haematopoietic disorders are reviewed.Multiple translocation partner genes are well known for leukaemia such as MYC, MLL, RARA, ALK, and RUNX1. With the advent of more sophisticated diagnostic tools and bioinformatics algorithms, an exponential growth in fusion genes discoveries is likely to increase.Demonstration of fusion genes and their specific translocation breakpoints in malignant haematological disorders are crucial for understanding the molecular pathogenesis and clinical phenotype of cancer, determining prognostic indexes and therapeutic responses, and monitoring residual disease and relapse status.((PMID:26345235))In the present study, we analyzed microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression profiles using 499 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples and 58 normal thyroid tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A pivotal regulatory network of 18 miRNA and 16 targets was identified. Upregulated miRNAs (miR-222, miR-221, miR-146b, miR-181a/b/d, miR-34a, and miR-424) and downregulated miRNAs (miR-9-1, miR-138, miR-363, miR-20b, miR-195, and miR-152) were identified. Among them, the upregulation of miR-424 and downregulation of miR-363, miR-195, and miR-152 were not previously identified. The genes CCNE2 (also known as cyclin E2), E2F1, RARA, CCND1 (cyclin D1), RUNX1, ITGA2, MET, CDKN1A (p21), and COL4A1 were overexpressed, and AXIN2, TRAF6, BCL2, RARB, HSP90B1, FGF7, and PDGFRA were downregulated. Among them, CCNE2, COL4A1, TRAF6, and HSP90B1 were newly identified. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, several miRNAs (miR-222, miR-221, and miR-34a) and genes (CCND1 and MET) were ideal diagnostic indicators, with sensitivities and specificities greater than 90%. The combination of inversely expressed miRNAs and targets improved diagnostic accuracy. In a clinical feature analysis, several miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-424, miR-20b, and miR-152) and genes (CCNE2, COL4A1, TRAF6, and HSP90B1) were associated with aggressive clinical features, which have not previously been reported. Our study not only identified a pivotal miRNA regulatory network associated with PTC but also provided evidence that miRNAs and target genes can be used as biomarkers in PTC diagnosis and clinical risk evaluation.((PMID:26126967))Transcriptional dysregulation is associated with haematological malignancy. Although mutations of the key haematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 are rare in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), they are common in murine models of radiation-induced AML, and PU.1 downregulation and/or dysfunction has been described in human AML patients carrying the fusion oncogenes RUNX1-ETO and PML-RARA. To study the transcriptional programmes associated with compromised PU.1 activity, we adapted a Pu.1-mutated murine AML cell line with an inducible wild-type PU.1. PU.1 induction caused transition from leukaemia phenotype to monocytic differentiation. Global binding maps for PU.1, CEBPA and the histone mark H3K27Ac with and without PU.1 induction showed that mutant PU.1 retains DNA-binding ability, but the induction of wild-type protein dramatically increases both the number and the height of PU.1-binding peaks. Correlating chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Seq with gene expression data, we found that PU.1 recruitment coupled with increased histone acetylation induces gene expression and activates a monocyte/macrophage transcriptional programme. PU.1 induction also caused the reorganisation of a subgroup of CEBPA binding peaks. Finally, we show that the PU.1 target gene set defined in our model allows the stratification of primary human AML samples, shedding light on both known and novel AML subtypes that may be driven by PU.1 dysfunction.((PMID:24464319))The lack of molecular diagnosis in the field of cancer in Iraq has motivated us to perform a genetic analysis of pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), including class I and II aberrations. Peripheral blood or bone marrow cells were collected from 134 AML children aged ≤15 years. Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper cards were used to transfer dried blood samples from five Iraqi hospitals to Japan. DNA sequencing was performed to identify class I mutations. Nested RT-PCR was used to detect class II aberrations, except that MLL rearrangement was detected according to long distance inverse-PCR. NPM1 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations were analyzed by GeneScan using DNA template. Among 134 Iraqi pediatric AML samples, the most prevalent FAB subtype was M2 (33.6 %) followed by M3 (17.9 %). Class I mutations: 20 (14.9 %), 8 (6.0 %), and 8 (6.0 %) patients had FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and KIT mutations, respectively. Class II mutations: 24 (17.9 %), 19 (14.2 %), and 9 (6.7 %) children had PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11 transcripts, respectively. MLL rearrangements were detected in 25 (18.7 %) patients. NPM1 mutation was detected in seven (5.2 %) cases. Collectively, approximately 30 % of AML children were proved to carry favorable prognostic genetic abnormalities, whereas approximately 10 % had high FLT3-ITD allelic burden and needed a special treatment plan including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was frequent among Iraqi pediatric AML. It is likely that molecular diagnosis using FTA cards in underdeveloped countries could guide doctors towards an appropriate treatment strategy.((PMID:23806810))The recent World Health Organization classification recognizes different subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the presence of several recurrent genetic abnormalities. Detection of these abnormalities and other molecular changes is of increasing interest because it contributes to a refined diagnosis and prognostic assessment in AML and enables monitoring of minimal residual disease. These genetic abnormalities can be detected using single RT-PCR, although the screening is still labor intensive and costly. We have developed a novel real-time RT-PCR assay to simultaneously detect 15 AML-associated rearrangements that is a simple and easily applicable method for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories. This method showed 100% specificity and sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 91% to 100% and 92% to 100%, respectively). The procedure was validated in a series of 105 patients with AML. The method confirmed all translocations detected using standard cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization and some additional undetected rearrangements. Two patients demonstrated two molecular rearrangements simultaneously, with BCR-ABL1 implicated in both, in addition to RUNX1-MECOM in one patient and PML-RARA in another. In conclusion, this novel real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of multiple AML-associated fusion genes is a versatile and sensitive method for reliable screening of recurrent rearrangements in AML.((PMID:23358744))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The genetic diagnostics have become an essential component in the initial work-up for disease classification, prognostication and prediction. More and more promising molecular targeted therapeutics are becoming available. A prerequisite for individualized treatment strategies is a fast pretherapeutic molecular screening including the fusion genes PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11 as well as mutations in the genes NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA. Promising new therapeutic approaches include the combination of all- trans retinoic acid and arsentrioxid in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the combination of intensive chemotherapy with KIT inhibitors in core-binding factor AML and FLT3 inhibitors in AML with FLT3 mutation, as well as gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy in patients with low and intermediate cytogenetic risk profiles. With the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies it is expected that new therapeutic targets will be identified. These insights will lead to a further individualization of AML therapy.((PMID:23130347))Prognosis is known to be better in cases with isolated chromosomal abnormalities than in those with complex karyotypes. Accordingly, del(20q) as an isolated abnormality must be distinguished from cases in which it is associated with other chromosomal rearrangements for a better stratification of prognosis. We report a case of an isolated del(20q) abnormality with additional genomic aberrations identified using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping. A 39-yr-old man was diagnosed with AML without maturation. Metaphase cytogenetic analysis (MC) revealed del(20)(q11.2) as the isolated abnormality in 100% of metaphase cells analyzed, and FISH analysis using D20S108 confirmed the 20q deletion in 99% of interphase cells. Using FISH, other rearrangements such as BCR/ABL1, RUNX1/RUNX1T1, PML/RARA, CBFB/MYH11, and MLL were found to be negative. SNP-A identified an additional copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in the 11q13.1-q25 region. Furthermore, SNP-A allowed for a more precise definition of the breakpoints of the 20q deletion (20q11.22-q13.31). Unexpectedly, the terminal regions showed gain on chromosome 20q. The patient did not achieve complete remission; 8 months later, he died from complications of leukemic cell infiltrations into the central nervous system. This study suggests that a presumably isolated chromosomal abnormality by MC may have additional genomic aberrations, including CN-LOH, which could be associated with a poor prognosis. SNP-A-based karyotyping may be helpful for distinguishing true isolated cases from cases in combination with additional genomic aberrations not detected by MC.((PMID:23091311))Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) has recently emerged as an alternative to cytogenetics. We designed and used simplified mRT-PCR system as a molecular screen for acute leukemia. Fifteen fusion transcripts were included: BCR-ABL1, PML-RARA, ZBTB16-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, DEK-NUP214, TCF3-PBX1, ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-AFF1, MLL-MLLT4, MLL-MLLT3, MLL-MLLT10, MLL-ELL, MLL-MLLT1, and MLL-MLLT6. A total of 121 diagnostic acute leukemia specimens were studied, comparing the mRT-PCR system with standard cytogenetics. Fifty-six cases (46.3%) had fusion transcripts revealed by our mRT-PCR assay. The concordance rate between mRT-PCR and cytogenetics was 91.7%. However, false negative results were found in three cases who have inv(16), t(4;11) or t(11;19)(q23;p13.1), respectively. Seven cryptic translocations including ETV6-RUNX1, MLL-MLLT3, MLL-MLLT4, and PML-RARA were detected. This mRT-PCR assay is a useful screening tool in acute leukemia because it provides rapid and reliable detection of clinically important chimeric transcripts. In addition, cryptic translocations provide additional genetic information that could be clinically useful.((PMID:22915647))The karyotype is so far the most important prognostic parameter in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Molecular mutations have been analyzed to subdivide AML with normal karyotype into prognostic subsets. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic model for the entire AML cohort solely based on molecular markers. One thousand patients with cytogenetic data were investigated for the following molecular alterations: PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, FLT3-ITD, and MLL-PTD, as well as mutations in NPM1, CEPBA, RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53. Clinical data were available in 841 patients. Based on Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, 5 distinct prognostic subgroups were identified: (1) very favorable: PML-RARA rearrangement (n = 29) or CEPBA double mutations (n = 42; overall survival [OS] at 3 years: 82.9%); (2) favorable: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n = 35), CBFB-MYH11 (n = 31), or NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD (n = 186; OS at 3 years: 62.6%); (3) intermediate: none of the mutations leading to assignment into groups 1, 2, 4, or 5 (n = 235; OS at 3 years: 44.2%); (4) unfavorable: MLL-PTD and/or RUNX1 mutation and/or ASXL1 mutation (n = 203; OS at 3 years: 21.9%); and (5) very unfavorable: TP53 mutation (n = 80; OS at 3 years: 0%; P < .001). This comprehensive molecular characterization provides a more powerful model for prognostication than cytogenetics.((PMID:22450142))Most leukemia and lymphoma cases are characterized by specific flow cytometric, cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations, which can also be detected in healthy individuals in some cases. The authors review the literature concerning monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, and the occurrence of chromosomal translocations t(14;18) and t(11;14), NPM-ALK fusion gene, JAK2 V617F mutation, BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, ETV6-RUNX1(TEL-AML1), MLL-AF4 and PML-RARA fusion gene in healthy individuals. At present, we do not know the importance of these aberrations. From the authors review it is evident that this phenomenon has both theoretical and practical (diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic) significance.((PMID:25750172))The transcription factor PU.1, encoded by the murine Sfpi1 gene (SPI1 in humans), is a member of the Ets transcription factor family and plays a vital role in commitment and maturation of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Murine studies directly link primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and decreased PU.1 expression in specifically modified strains. Similarly, a radiation-induced chromosome 2 deletion and subsequent Sfpi1 point mutation in the remaining allele lead to murine radiation-induced AML. Consistent with murine data, heterozygous deletion of the SPI1 locus and mutation of the -14kb SPI1 upstream regulatory element were described previously in human primary AML, although they are rare events. Other mechanisms linked to PU.1 downregulation in human AML include TP53 deletion, FLT3-ITD mutation and the recurrent AML1-ETO [t(8;21)] and PML-RARA [t(15;17)] translocations. This review provides an up-to-date overview on our current understanding of the involvement of PU.1 in the initiation and development of radiation-induced AML, together with recommendations for future murine and human studies.((PMID:25338564))This study was aimed to detect the expression of Musashi-2 (Msi2) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and investigate the relationship between Msi2 and other clinical parameters, especially CD34. A total RNA was extracted from bone marrow of newly diagnosed AML patietns. The Msi2 mRNA expression in newly diagnosed AML patients was detected with real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. The expression level of CD34 in above-menthioned patients was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The relationship between the expression of Msi2 mRNA and clinical outcome in AML patients was analysed. The results showed that (1)the expression of Msi2 mRNA in newly diagnosed AML patients was much higher than that in healthy volunteers (P < 0.05) , especially in M1, M4 and M5 patients; (2)the expression level of Msi2 did not correlate with age, sex, white blood cell count of peripheral blood, AML1/ETO and PML/RARa fusion gene (P > 0.05); (3) Msi2 expression level in patients with CD34(+) cells was significantly higher than that in patients with CD34(-) cells (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the Msi2 mRNA expresses in leukamia stem cells, the high expression of Msi2 mRNA has been found in newly diagnosed AML patients, especially in M1, M4 and M5 patients, the high expression also has been observed in patients with CD34(+).((PMID:24598642))The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with NPM1 mutation in exon 12 and to explore the relationship between NPM1 mutation and FLT3-ITD, IDH1 mutation. The AML clinical data and bone marrow samples of patients were collected. The diagnosis and classification were based on WHO criteria. The genomic DNA was extracted and NPM1 mutation was detected by sequencing after PCR. The specimens of 389 AML patients were tested. The results showed that the NPM1 mutation was found in 14.1% samples (55/389). The incidence of FLT3-ITD mutation was 14.7% (57/389) . The incidence of IDH1 mutation was 6.4% (25/389) . NPM1 mutation was not detected in AML with AML1-ETO, PML-RARA or CBF-MYH11 fusion genes. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were 29.1% and 12.7% respectively in AML with NPM1 mutation. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were 12.3% and 5.4% respectively in AML without NPM1 mutation. The incidences of FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation were significantly higher in AML with NPM1 mutation than that in AML without NPM1 mutation. The incidence of NPM1 mutation in normal karyotype AML was 26.5% (35/132) which significantly higher than that in other AML. The AML with NPM1 mutation characterized by older age, high platelet number, higher incidence in AML-M5, lower CD34 positive cells, more possible co-existence with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation and other clinical features. The complete remission rate after one cycle of induction chemotherapy was 69.8% in AML without NPM1 mutation. The complete remission rate after one cycle of induction chemotherapy was 72.2% in AML with NPM1 mutation, there was no significant difference between them (P = 0.07). It is concluded that AML with NPM1 mutation has distinct clinical features. NPM1 mutation can co-exists with FLT3-ITD and IDH1 mutation, but not with AML1-ETO, PML-RARA or CBF-MYH11 fusion genes.((PMID:23737874))The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of the four subtypes of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs) in order to improve current knowledge and to aid their diagnosis. A total of 53 cases of MDS/MPNs were analyzed using routine blood cell analysis and morphological, cytogenetic and molecular genetic characteristics were investigated. Numerical data for several groups were compared using a single-factor analysis of variance. The Student-Newman-Keuls test was used to compare the means of two groups. The proportions were compared using a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Analysis of the patients with MDS/MPNs revealed that 46 patients (86.8%) had paleness and fatigue, and blood analysis revealed hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 83.1±24.6 g/l, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.8±8.1×10(9)/l and a platelet (PLT) count of 158.7±108.2×10(12)/l. Immature neutrophils and monocytes were identified in the peripheral blood at levels of 0.058±0.031 and 0.152±0.034%, respectively. There were 23 cases (43.4%) with dyserythropoiesis and 36 cases (67.9%) had dysgranulopoiesis. Fifteen cases were immunologically characterized using flow cytometry (FCM), of which 13 cases showed abnormalities on blasts and myelocytes. Karyotyping was performed in 27 cases of MDS/MPN and 12 (44.4%) were identified as abnormal. In 23 cases, testing for BCR/ABL1, AML-ETO, CBF-MYH11A, PML-RARA, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, SIL-TAL1 returned negative results. The JAK2V617F mutation was positive in one of five cases. The majority of MDS/MPN cases had anemia, cytosis, low-grade blasts and immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood and dysplasia in the bone marrow. Immunological abnormalities and abnormal karyotypes occurred frequently in MDS/MPNs and although there were no statistical differences between the four subtypes, these were able to aid diagnosis. No specific molecular abnormalities were identified in MDS/MPNs.((PMID:22811791))The incidence of common fusion transcripts in AML is 40-45%, but data from Indian sub-continent is limited. AIMS #ENTITYSTARTX00026;The aim of the present study is to note the incidence of common fusion transcripts of AML1-ETO, PML-RARA and CBFβ-MYH11 in adult and pediatric AML cases. MATERIALS #ENTITYSTARTX00026;A total of 116 AML cases diagnosed on bone marrow, cytochemistry and Flow-cytometry over a period of 2 year were enrolled and bone marrow samples in EDTA were processed by multiplex RT-PCR assay.Of 116 cases, 96 (83%) were adult and 20 (17%) pediatric cases. A total of 39/116 (33.6%) cases showed positivity for fusion transcripts of which 28/96 (29.16%) were adult and 11/20 (55%) pediatric cases. Of the 28 positive adult cases, 14/96 (14.58%) were positive for AML1-ETO, 12/96 (12.5%) for PML-RARA and 2/96 (2.08%) for CBFβ-MYH11. In the 11 positive pediatric cases, 6/20 (30%) were positive for AML1-ETO, 3/20 (15%) for PML-RARA and 2/20 (10%) for CBFβ-MYH11. DISCUSSION #ENTITYSTARTX00026;The incidence of the common fusion transcripts in our pilot study is in accordance with that described in western studies. It is important to identify these transcripts as they provide useful prognostic information to the treating clinician.((PMID:22397365))Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) metabolic genes encode cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. Acquired somatic mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been reported in some types of brain tumors and a small proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases.Two-hundred and thirty newly diagnosed AML patients were analyzed for the presence of IDH1 and IDH2 heterozygous mutations by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) followed by direct sequencing. Clinical and biological characteristics were analyzed and correlated to the IDH mutational status. Coexisting mutations such as FLT3, PML-RARA, RAS, AML1, and NPM1 mutations were additionally explored.The prevalence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations was 8.7% (20/230) and 10.4% (24/230), respectively. Six missense mutations were identified among IDH1-mutated cases; p.R132H (n = 8), p.R132C (n = 6), p.R132S (n = 2), p.R132G (n = 2), p.R132L (n = 1), and p.I99M (n = 1). Two missense mutations were found in IDH2-mutated cases; p.R140Q (n = 20) and p.R172K (n = 4). No patients had dual IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. About 18% of AML with normal cytogenetics and 31% of acute promyelocytic leukemia had IDH mutations. Half of the IDH-mutated cohort had normal karyotype and the major FAB subtype was AML-M2. Interestingly, IDH1- and IDH2-mutated cases predominantly had NPM1 mutations (60-74%) as compared to the wild type (P < 0.001). Very few IDH-mutated cases had FLT3 and/or RAS abnormalities and none of them had AML1 mutations. Older age and higher median platelet counts were significantly associated with IDH2 mutations although the clinical impact of either IDH1 or IDH2 mutations on patients' overall survival could not be observed.Overall, 19% of newly diagnosed AML patients had alterations of IDH genes. No patients concurrently carried both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations suggesting that these mutations were mutually exclusive. NPM1 mutation appears as a major coexisting genetic mutation in IDH-mutated patients. Our present data failed to support the prognostic relevance of IDH mutations although alterations of these metabolic genes potentially have an important role in leukemia development.((PMID:21258047))Chromatin modifications at both histones and DNA are critical for regulating gene expression. Mis-regulation of such epigenetic marks can lead to pathological states; indeed, cancer affecting the hematopoietic system is frequently linked to epigenetic abnormalities. Here, we discuss the different types of modifications and their general impact on transcription, as well as the polycomb group of proteins, which effect transcriptional repression and are often mis-regulated. Further, we discuss how chromosomal translocations leading to fusion proteins can aberrantly regulate gene transcription through chromatin modifications within the hematopoietic system. PML-RARa, AML1-ETO and MLL-fusions are examples of fusion proteins that mis-regulate epigenetic modifications (either directly or indirectly), which can lead to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms behind the mis-regulation of epigenetic modifications that lead to the development and progression of AMLs could be critical for designing effective treatments.((PMID:18349282))We used MethyLight assays to analyze DNA methylation status of 27 genes on 49 paired cancerous and noncancerous tissue samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent surgical resection. Seven genes (RARB, BVES, CDKN2A, KCNH5, RASSF1, CDH13, and RUNX) were found to be methylated significantly more frequently in tumor tissues than in noncancerous tissues. Only methylation of CCND2 and APC was frequently detected in both cancerous and noncancerous tissues, supporting the hypothesis that the methylation of these two genes is a preneoplastic change and may be associated with tobacco smoking exposure. Methylation of any one of eight genes (RASSF1, DAPK1, BVES, CDH13, MGMT, KCNH5, RARB, or CDH1) was present in 80% of NSCLC tissues but only in 14% of noncancerous tissues. Detection of methylation of these genes in blood might have utility in monitoring and detecting tumor recurrence in early-stage NSCLC after curative surgical resection.((PMID:16613851))MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP are leukemogenic fusion proteins associated with therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia. These proteins are thought to subvert normal gene expression in differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have previously shown that MOZ-TIF2 inhibits transcription by CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300-dependent activators such as nuclear receptors and p53. Here we have shown that MOZ-TIF2 associates with the RARbeta2 promoter in vivo, resulting in altered recruitment of CBP/p300, aberrant histone modification, and down-regulation of the RARbeta2 gene. In contrast, MOZ-TIF2 up-regulated transcription mediated by the MOZ/MYST3-dependent activator AML1/RUNX1. Both wild type MOZ and MOZ-TIF2 were found to colocalize with AML1, and MOZ-TIF2 was recruited to an AML1 target promoter. A MOZ-CBP fusion protein showed similar functions to MOZ-TIF2 in that it inhibited retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription but enhanced AML1 reporter activation. Although it contains almost the entire CBP sequence, MOZ-CBP does not appear to associate with PML bodies. In summary, our results indicate that leukemogenic MOZ fusion proteins have differential effects on the activities of CBP-dependent and MOZ-dependent activators because of their ability to alter cofactor recruitment and chromatin modification at target promoters.((PMID:18767146))The ETV6-RUNX1 fusion is the molecular consequence of the t(12;21)(p13;q22) seen in approximately 25% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Studies have shown that the fusion alone is insufficient for the initiation of leukemia; additional genetic changes are required. Genomic profiling identified copy number alterations at high frequencies in these patients. Focal deletions of TBL1XR1 were observed in 15% of cases; 3 patients exhibited deletions distal to the gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed these deletions and quantitative RT-PCR showed that the TBL1XR1 gene was significantly under-expressed. TBL1XR1 is a key component of the SMRT and N-CoR compressor complexes, which control hormone-receptor mediated gene expression. Differential expression of the retinoic acid target genes, RARB, CRABP1, and CRABP2, indicated that deletion of TBL1XR1 compromised the function of SMRT/N-CoR in the appropriate control of gene expression. This study identifies deletions of TBL1XR1 as a recurrent abnormality in ETV6-RUNX1 positive ALL. We provide evidence that implicates this deletion in the inappropriate control of gene expression in these patients. The target of the interaction between TBL1XR1 and the signaling pathways described here may be exploited in cancer therapy.((PMID:21236478))IL-13 is a central mediator of airway responsiveness and mucus expression in patients with allergic airway inflammation, and IL-13 is currently a therapeutic target for asthma. However, little is known about how IL-13 regulates human CD4(+) T-cell lineages because IL-13 receptor (IL-13R) α1, a subunit of IL-13R, has not previously been reported to exist on human T cells.We sought to determine whether human CD4(+) T(H)17 cells express IL-13Rα1 and whether IL-13 regulates T(H)17 cytokine production.Naive human CD4(+) cells were isolated from whole blood, activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and polarized to T(H)1, T(H)2, T(H)17, or induced regulatory T cells in the presence of IL-13 (0-10 ng/mL). Cell supernatants, total RNA, or total protein was examined 4 days after T(H)17 polarization.T(H)17 cells, but not T(H)0, T(H)1, T(H)2, or induced regulatory T cells, expressed IL-13Rα1. IL-13 attenuated IL-17A production, as well as expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor, runt-related transcription factor-1, and interferon regulatory factor 4 in T(H)17-polarized cells. IL-13 neither inhibited IFN-γ production from T(H)1 cells nor inhibited IL-4 production from T(H)2 cells. Furthermore, attenuation of IL-17A production only occurred when IL-13 was present within 24 hours of T-cell activation or at the time of restimulation.IL-13Rα1 is expressed on human CD4(+) T(H)17 cells, and IL-13 attenuates IL-17A production at polarization and restimulation. Although IL-13 is an attractive therapeutic target for decreasing symptoms associated with asthma, these results suggest that therapies inhibiting IL-13 production could have adverse side effects by increasing IL-17A production.((PMID:15963785))Invariant Valpha14i NKT (iNKT) cells are a specialized subset of T lymphocytes with regulatory functions. They coexpress TCRalphabeta and natural killer cell markers. They differentiate through interaction of their Valpha14-Jalpha18 invariant TCRalpha chains with CD1d expressed on double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Although their development has been shown to be thymus dependent, their developmental pathway has not been definitively established. By using genetic analyses, we show here that all iNKT cells are selected from a pool of DP thymocytes. Their development is absolutely dependent on Runx1 and ROR(gamma)t, transcription factors that influence, but are not required for, development of conventional T cells. Our results indicate that even though CD1d binding DP thymocytes have yet to be observed, Valpha14-Jalpha18 rearrangement in these cells is required for development of iNKT cells.((PMID:23626757))Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a significant number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many complex human traits, the susceptibility loci identified so far can explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. Among other possible explanations, the lack of a comprehensive examination of gene-gene interaction (G×G) is often considered a source of the missing heritability. Previously, we reported a model-free Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) approach for detecting G×G in both dichotomous and quantitative phenotypes. However, the computational burden and less efficient implementation of the original programs make them impossible to use for GWAS. In this study, we developed a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based GMDR program (named GWAS-GPU), which is able not only to analyze GWAS data but also to run much faster than the earlier version of the GMDR program. As a demonstration of the program, we used the GMDR-GPU software to analyze a publicly available GWAS dataset on type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Through an exhaustive search of pair-wise interactions and a selected search of three- to five-way interactions conditioned on significant pair-wise results, we identified 24 core SNPs in six genes (FTO: rs9939973, rs9940128, rs9922047, rs1121980, rs9939609, rs9930506; TSPAN8: rs1495377; TCF7L2: rs4074720, rs7901695, rs4506565, rs4132670, rs10787472, rs11196205, rs10885409, rs11196208; L3MBTL3: rs10485400, rs4897366; CELF4: rs2852373, rs608489; RUNX1: rs445984, rs1040328, rs990074, rs2223046, rs2834970) that appear to be important for T2D. Of these core SNPs, 11 in FTO, TSPAN8, and TCF7L2 have been reported to be associated with T2D, obesity, or both, providing an independent replication of previously reported SNPs. Importantly, we identified three new susceptibility genes; i.e., L3MBTL3, CELF4, and RUNX1, for T2D, a finding that warrants further investigation with independent samples.((PMID:23028138))To identify epigenetic patterns, which may predispose to type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to a family history (FH) of the disease, we analyzed DNA methylation genome-wide in skeletal muscle from individuals with (FH(+)) or without (FH(-)) an FH of T2D. We found differential DNA methylation of genes in biological pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), insulin, and calcium signaling (P ≤ 0.007) and of individual genes with known function in muscle, including MAPK1, MYO18B, HOXC6, and the AMP-activated protein kinase subunit PRKAB1 in skeletal muscle of FH(+) compared with FH(-) men. We further validated our findings from FH(+) men in monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T2D, and 40% of 65 analyzed genes exhibited differential DNA methylation in muscle of both FH(+) men and diabetic twins. We further examined if a 6-month exercise intervention modifies the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in skeletal muscle of the FH(+) and FH(-) individuals. DNA methylation of genes in retinol metabolism and calcium signaling pathways (P < 3 × 10(-6)) and with known functions in muscle and T2D including MEF2A, RUNX1, NDUFC2, and THADA decreased after exercise. Methylation of these human promoter regions suppressed reporter gene expression in vitro. In addition, both expression and methylation of several genes, i.e., ADIPOR1, BDKRB2, and TRIB1, changed after exercise. These findings provide new insights into how genetic background and environment can alter the human epigenome.((PMID:21746882))A new class of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells that produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) (termed Th17) has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], has a direct repressive effect on the expression of IL-17A in both human and mouse T cells. In vivo treatment of mice with ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of multiple sclerosis) diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces IL-17A-secreting CD4(+) T cells in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) repression of IL-17A expression was found to be transcriptional repression, mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Transcription assays, gel shifting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that the negative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on IL-17A involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NFAT), recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC), sequestration of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR, and a direct effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on induction of Foxp3. Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of autoimmune diseases.((PMID:16195230))Osteopontin (OPN), a glycosylated phosphoprotein that binds calcium, is present in bone extracellular matrix and has been reported to modulate both mineralization and bone resorption. Targeted disruption in mice of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) or Runx2 results in marked inhibition of OPN expression in osteoblasts. In this study, we addressed possible cross-talk between VDR and Runx2 in regulating OPN transcription. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) or Runx2 stimulated OPN transcription (mouse OPN promoter -777/+79) 2-3-fold. However, coexpression of Runx2 and VDR in COS-7 cells and treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) resulted in an 8-fold induction of OPN transcription, indicating for the first time functional cooperation between Runx2 and VDR in the regulation of OPN transcription. In ROS 17/2.8 and MC3T3-E1 cells that contain endogenous Runx2, AML-1/ETO, which acts as a repressor of Runx2, significantly inhibited 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induction of OPN transcription, OPN mRNA, and protein expression. Both a Runx2 site (-136/-130) and the vitamin D response element (-757/-743) in the OPN promoter are needed for cooperative activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can enhance VDR and Runx2 recruitment on the OPN promoter, further indicating cooperation between these two factors in the regulation of OPN. In osteoblastic cells, Hes-1, a downstream factor of the Notch signaling pathway, was found to enhance basal and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced OPN transcription. This enhancement was inhibited by AML-1/ETO, an inhibitor of Runx2. Immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Hes-1 and Runx2 interact and that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) can enhance this interaction. Taken together, these findings define novel mechanisms involving the intersection of three pathways, Runx2, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and Notch signaling, that play a major role in the regulation of OPN in osteoblastic cells and therefore in the process of bone remodeling.((PMID:20236534))The mineralized skeleton is a major evolutionary novelty that has contributed to the impressive morphological diversifications of the vertebrates. Essential to bone biology is the solidified extracellular matrix secreted by highly specialized cells, the osteoblasts. We now have a rather complete view of the events underlying osteogenesis, from a cellular, molecular, genetic, and epigenetic perspective. Because this knowledge is still largely restricted to mammals, it is difficult, if not impossible, to deduce the evolutionary history of the regulatory network involved in osteoblasts specification and differentiation. In this study, we focused on the transcriptional regulators Runx2 and VDR (the Vitamin D Receptor) that, in mammals, directly interact together and stabilize complexes of co-activators and chromatin remodellers, thereby allowing the transcriptional activation of target genes involved in extracellular matrix mineralization. Using a combination of functional, biochemical, and histological approaches, we have asked if the interaction observed between Runx2 and VDR represents a recent mammalian innovation, or if it results from more ancient changes that have occurred deep in the vertebrate lineage.Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in developing embryos of chick, frog and teleost fishes, we have revealed that the co-expression of Runx2 and VDR in skeletal elements has been particularly strengthened in the lineage leading to amniotes. We show that the teleost Runx2 orthologue as well as the three mammalian Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 paralogues are able to co-immunoprecipitate with the VDR protein present in nuclear extracts of rat osteoblasts stimulated with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, the teleost Runx2 can activate the transcription of the mammalian osteocalcin promoter in transfection experiments, and this response can be further enhanced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Finally, using pull-down experiments between recombinant proteins, we show that the VDR homologue from teleosts, but not from ascidians, is able to directly interact with the mammalian Runx2 homologue.We propose an evolutionary scenario for the assembly of the molecular machinery involving Runx2 and VDR in vertebrates. In the last common ancestor of actinopterygians and sacropterygians, the three Runx paralogues possessed the potential to physically and functionally interact with the VDR protein. Therefore, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 might have been able to modulate the transcriptional activity of Runx1, Runx2 or Runx3 in the tissues expressing VDR. After the split from amphibians, in the lineage leading to amniotes, Runx2 and VDR became robustly co-expressed in developing skeletal elements, and their regulatory interaction was incorporated in the genetic program involved in the specification and differentiation of osteoblasts.((PMID:24263100))MicroRNAs are key regulators of many biological processes, including cell differentiation. These small RNAs exert their function assembled in the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), where members of Argonaute (Ago) family of proteins provide a unique platform for target recognition and gene silencing. Here, by using myeloid cell lines and primary blasts, we show that Ago2 has a key role in human monocytic cell fate determination and in LPS-induced inflammatory response of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3)-treated myeloid cells. The silencing of Ago2 impairs the D3-dependent miR-17-5p/20a/106a, miR-125b and miR-155 downregulation, the accumulation of their translational targets AML1, VDR and C/EBPβ and monocytic cell differentiation. Moreover, we show that Ago2 is recruited on miR-155 host gene promoter and on the upstream region of an overlapping antisense lncRNA, determining their epigenetic silencing, and miR-155 downregulation. These findings highlight Ago2 as a new factor in myeloid cell fate determination in acute myeloid leukemia cells.((PMID:17244680))Alteration of lineage-specific transcriptional programs for hematopoiesis causes differentiation block and promotes leukemia development. Here, we show that AML1/ETO, the most common translocation fusion product in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), counteracts the activity of retinoic acid (RA), a transcriptional regulator of myelopoiesis. AML1/ETO participates in a protein complex with the RA receptor alpha (RARalpha) at RA regulatory regions on RARbeta2, which is a key RA target gene mediating RA activity/resistance in cells. At these sites, AML1/ETO recruits histone deacetylase, DNA methyltransferase, and DNA-methyl-CpG binding activities that promote a repressed chromatin conformation. The link among AML1/ETO, heterochromatic RARbeta2 repression, RA resistance, and myeloid differentiation block is indicated by the ability of either siRNA-AML1/ETO or the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine to revert these epigenetic alterations and to restore RA differentiation response in AML1/ETO blasts. Finally, RARbeta2 is commonly silenced by hypermethylation in primary AML blasts but not in normal hematopoietic precursors, thus suggesting a role for the epigenetic repression of the RA signaling pathway in myeloid leukemogenesis.((PMID:19536094))The human death-associated protein 3 (hDAP3) is a GTP-binding constituent of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome with a pro-apoptotic function.A search through publicly available microarray data sets showed 337 genes potentially coregulated with the DAP3 gene. The promoter sequences of these 337 genes and 70 out of 85 mitochondrial ribosome genes were analysed in silico with the DAP3 gene promoter sequence. The mitochondrial role of DAP3 was also investigated in the thyroid tumours presenting various mitochondrial contents.The study revealed nine transcription factors presenting enriched motifs for these gene promoters, five of which are implicated in cellular growth (ELK1, ELK4, RUNX1, HOX11-CTF1, TAL1-ternary complex factor 3) and four in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), GABPA, PPARG-RXRA and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA)). An independent microarray data set showed the overexpression of ELK1, RUNX1 and ESRRA in the thyroid oncocytic tumours. Exploring the thyroid tumours, we found that DAP3 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in tumours presenting a mitochondrial biogenesis compared with the normal tissue. ELK1 and ESRRA were also showed upregulated with DAP3.ELK1 and ESRRA may be considered as potential regulators of the DAP3 gene expression. DAP3 may participate in mitochondrial maintenance and play a role in the balance between mitochondrial homoeostasis and tumourigenesis.((PMID:23597428))Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) regulates both glucose metabolism and bone mass. Evidence suggests that the therapeutic modulation of PPARγ with synthetic agonists activity may elicit undesirable effects on bone. However, there is no information regarding its natural agonist 15d-PGJ2, besides its excellent anti-inflammatory action. In the present study the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on osteoblastic cells were determined. Osteoblastic cells (MC3T3) were cultured in an osteogenic medium in the presence of 1, 3 or 10 μM of 15d-PGJ2 during 21 days and alizarin and Von Kossa staining were employed. The protein expression (type-I collagen, osteonectin, osteopontin, RANKL, osteoprotegerin, HDAC-9c and PPAR-γ) was evaluated after 3 days in the presence of 15d-PGJ2 by western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence methods. The production of mineralized extracellular matrix was observed by transmission electron microscopy. After 72 h of culture, the mRNA was extracted for RT-qPCR analysis of RUNX expression. In the presence of all 3 tested 15d-PGJ2 doses, alizarin red and Von kossa staining were positive demonstrating the ability to the osteoblast differentiation. Type-I collagen and osteonectin proteins expression were up-regulated (p < 0.05) after 72 h in the presence of the smaller doses of 15d-PGJ2. In contrast, osteopontin, RANKL and OPG expression did not significantly alter. In the presence of 15d-PGJ2 it was possible to visualize mineralized nodules in the extracellular matrix confirmed with the increased RUNX mRNA expression. 15d-PGJ2 at small doses increased the osteoblast activity and the bone-related proteins expression.((PMID:23200915))Gene methylation and other epigenetic modifications of gene regulation have been implicated in the growth of ovarian cancer, but the clinical significance of such modifications in the Notch pathway in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) is not well understood. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to study the clinical relevance of epigenetic modifications of Notch superfamily genes.We analyzed the interaction of DNA methylation and miRNAs with gene expression data for Notch superfamily members with the Spearman rank correlation test and explored potential relationships with overall survival (OS) with the log-rank test. We downloaded clinical data, level 3 gene expression data, and level 3 DNA methylation data for 480 patients with stage II-IV HGS-OvCa from the TCGA data portal. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts for survival analyses. In each set, patients were grouped into percentiles according to methylation and microRNA (miRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. We used several algorithms to predict miRNA-mRNA interaction.There were significant inverse relationships between methylation status and mRNA expression for PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1. For each of these genes, patients with a lower methylation level and higher expression level had significantly poorer OS than did patients with a higher methylation level and lower expression level. We also found a significant inverse relationship between miRNAs and mRNA expression for CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1. By further analyzing the effect of miRNAs on gene expression and OS, we found that patients with higher levels of CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1 expression and lower expression levels of their respective miRNAs (502-5p, 128, and 215/625) had significantly poorer OS.Epigenetic alterations of multiple Notch target genes and pathway interacting genes (PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1) may relate to activation of this pathway and poor survival of patients with HGS-OvCa.((PMID:22541023))Muscle satellite cells are largely responsible for skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Side population (SP) cells, which are thought to be muscle stem cells, also contribute to muscle regeneration. SP cells exhibit high mesenchymal potential, and are a possible cell source for therapy of muscular dystrophy. However, the mechanism by which muscle SP cells are committed to differentiation is poorly understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in modulating a variety of cellular processes through repression of their mRNA targets. In skeletal muscle, miRNAs are known to be involved in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. To investigate mechanisms of SP cell regulation, we profiled miRNA expression in SP cells and main population (MP) cells in muscles using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based expression assays. We identified a set of miRNAs that was highly expressed in SP cells as compared with MP cells. One miRNA, miR-128a, was elevated in expression in SP cells, but decreased in expression during continued culture in vitro. Overexpression of miR-128a in SP cells resulted in inhibited cell proliferation. The differentiation potential of SP cells was also decreased when miR-128a was overexpressed. MiR-128a was found to regulate the target genes involved in the regulation of adipogenic-, osteogenic- and myogenic genes that include: PPARγ, Runx1, and Pax3. Overexpression of miR-128a suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter fused to the 3'-untranslated region of each gene. These results demonstrate that miR-128a contributes to the maintenance of the quiescent state, and it regulates cellular differentiation by repressing individual genes in SP cells.((PMID:19664990))Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (Sfrp1) is highly expressed by stromal cells maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sfrp1 loss in stromal cells increases production of hematopoietic progenitors, and in knockout mice, dysregulates hemostasis and increases Flk2- Cd34- Lin- Sca1+ Kit+ (LSK) cell numbers in bone marrow. Also, LSK and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) resided mainly in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, with an accompanying decrease in intracellular beta-catenin levels. Gene-expression studies showed a concomitant decrease Ccnd1 and Dkk1 in Cd34- LSK cells and increased expression of Pparg, Hes1, and Runx1 in MPP. Transplantation experiments showed no intrinsic effect of Sfrp1 loss on the number of HSCs or their ability to engraft irradiated recipients. In contrast, serial transplantations of wild-type HSCs into Sfrp1(-/-) mice show a progressive decrease of wild-type LSK and MPP numbers. Our results demonstrate that Sfrp1 is required to maintain HSC homeostasis through extrinsic regulation of beta-catenin.((PMID:27222482))Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is the most common form of the glomerular disease with unclear molecular mechanisms, which related to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize differentially expressed genes in the normal and adriamycin-induced CGN rats by microarray analysis, and to determine the potential molecular mechanisms of CGN pathogenesis.For the gene expression analysis, fresh glomerular tissues from both normal and adriamycin treated rats (n=4, respectively) were collected. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to Agilent Rat 4×44 K whole genome microarray. KEGG, Gene Ontology (GO) analyze, LIMMA, String and Cytoscape software were applied to screen and analyze differentially regulated genes. In addition, the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to verify the selected genes.2334 differentially regulated genes were identified including 1294 up-regulated genes and 1040 down-regulated genes. According to the results of Generank, String and Cytoscape analyses, 27 genes may be key controlled genes in the pathogenesis of CGN, including 14 up-regulated genes (Fos, Myc, Kng1, Rac2, Pik3r1, Egr1, Icam1, Syk, Anxa1, Lgals3, Ptprc, Runx1, Itgb7, Ccl6) and 13 down-regulated genes (Aldh2, Dpyd, Mthfd1, Gldc, Ppar-α, Igf1, Pomc, Oas1a, Gsr, Acox1, Cyp1a1, Ugt2b15, Hsd3b6), which primarily contribute to biological processes such as, cell cycle, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, immune response, metabolic process, and so on. Fos and Syk were considered as potent hub genes.Global gene expression profile analysis showed that the molecular mechanism of CGN pathogenesis may be related to the promotion of cell cycle and mitosis, dysregulation of cytokine secretion and disordered inflammatory response as well as abnormal metabolism.((PMID:24359430))We previously demonstrated that primary Th1Th17 cells are highly permissive to HIV-1, whereas Th1 cells are relatively resistant. Molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown.Exposure to replication competent and single-round VSV-G pseudotyped HIV strains provide evidence that superior HIV replication in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells was regulated by mechanisms located at entry and post-entry levels. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling identified transcripts upregulated (n = 264) and downregulated (n = 235) in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells (p-value < 0.05; fold change cut-off 1.3). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed pathways enriched in Th1Th17 (nuclear receptors, trafficking, p38/MAPK, NF-κB, p53/Ras, IL-23) vs. Th1 cells (proteasome, interferon α/β). Differentially expressed genes were classified into biological categories using Gene Ontology. Th1Th17 cells expressed typical Th17 markers (IL-17A/F, IL-22, CCL20, RORC, IL-26, IL-23R, CCR6) and transcripts functionally linked to regulating cell trafficking (CEACAM1, MCAM), activation (CD28, CD40LG, TNFSF13B, TNFSF25, PTPN13, MAP3K4, LTB, CTSH), transcription (PPARγ, RUNX1, ATF5, ARNTL), apoptosis (FASLG), and HIV infection (CXCR6, FURIN). Differential expression of CXCR6, PPARγ, ARNTL, PTPN13, MAP3K4, CTSH, SERPINB6, PTK2, and ISG20 was validated by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and/or confocal microscopy. The nuclear receptor PPARγ was preferentially expressed by Th1Th17 cells. PPARγ RNA interference significantly increased HIV replication at levels post-entry and prior HIV-DNA integration. Finally, the activation of PPARγ pathway via the agonist Rosiglitazone induced the nuclear translocation of PPARγ and a robust inhibition of viral replication.Thus, transcriptional profiling in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells demonstrated that HIV permissiveness is associated with a superior state of cellular activation and limited antiviral properties and identified PPARγ as an intrinsic negative regulator of viral replication. Therefore, triggering PPARγ pathway via non-toxic agonists may contribute to limiting covert HIV replication and disease progression during antiretroviral treatment.((PMID:25734857))The wingless-Int (WNT) pathway has an essential role in cell regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). For Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), the malignant counterpart of HSC, currently only a selective number of genes of the WNT pathway are analyzed by using either gene expression or DNA-methylation profiles for the identification of prognostic markers and potential candidate targets for drug therapy. It is known that mRNA expression is controlled by DNA-methylation and that specific patterns can infer the ability to differentiate biological differences, thus a combined analysis using all WNT annotated genes could provide more insight in the WNT signaling.We created a computational approach that integrates gene expression and DNA promoter methylation profiles. The approach represents the continuous gene expression and promoter methylation profiles with nine discrete mutually exclusive scenarios. The scenario representation allows for a refinement of patient groups by a more powerful statistical analysis, and the construction of a co-expression network. We focused on 268 WNT annotated signaling genes that are derived from the molecular signature database.Using the scenarios we identified seven prognostic markers for overall survival and event-free survival. Three genes are novel prognostic markers; two with favorable outcome (PSMD2, PPARD) and one with unfavorable outcome (XPNPEP). The remaining four genes (LEF1, SFRP2, RUNX1, and AXIN2) were previously identified but we could refine the patient groups. Three AML risk groups were further analyzed and the co-expression network showed that only the good risk group harbors frequent promoter hypermethylation and significantly correlated interactions with proteasome family members.Our results provide novel insights in WNT signaling in AML, we discovered new and previously identified prognostic markers and a refinement of the patient groups.((PMID:27119502))Limited evidence is available about the specific miRNA networks that regulate differentiation of specific immune cells. In this study, we characterized miRNA expression and associated alterations in expression with putative mRNA targets that are critical during differentiation of macrophages. In an effort to map the dynamic changes in the bone marrow (BM), we profiled whole BM cultures during differentiation into macrophages. We identified 112 miRNAs with expression patterns that were differentially regulated 5-fold or more during BMDM development. With TargetScan and MeSH databases, we identified 1267 transcripts involved in 30 canonical pathways linked to macrophage biology as potentially regulated by these specific 112 miRNAs. Furthermore, by employing miRanda and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) analysis systems, we identified 18 miRNAs that are temporally linked to the expression of CSF1R, CD36, MSR1 and SCARB1; 7 miRNAs linked to the regulation of the transcription factors RUNX1 and PU.1, and 14 miRNAs target the nuclear receptor PPARα and PPARγ. This novel information provides an important reference resource for further study of the functional links between miRNAs and their target mRNAs for the regulation of differentiation and function of macrophages.((PMID:25289940))Concurrent exercise combines different modes of exercise (e.g., aerobic and resistance) into one training protocol, providing stimuli meant to increase muscle strength, aerobic capacity and mass. As disuse is associated with decrements in strength, aerobic capacity and muscle size concurrent training is an attractive modality for rehabilitation. However, interference between the signaling pathways may result in preferential improvements for one of the exercise modes. We recruited 18 young adults (10 ♂, 8 ♀) to determine if order of exercise mode during concurrent training would differentially affect gene expression, protein content and measures of strength and aerobic capacity after 2 weeks of knee-brace induced disuse. Concurrent exercise sessions were performed 3x/week for 6 weeks at gradually increasing intensities either with endurance exercise preceding (END>RES) or following (RES>END) resistance exercise. Biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis before, 3 h after the first exercise bout and 48 h after the end of training. Concurrent exercise altered the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, PRC, PPARγ), hypertrophy (PGC-1α4, REDD2, Rheb) and atrophy (MuRF-1, Runx1), increased electron transport chain complex protein content, citrate synthase and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity, muscle mass, maximum isometric strength and VO 2peak. However, the order in which exercise was completed (END>RES or RES>END) only affected the protein content of mitochondrial complex II subunit. In conclusion, concurrent exercise training is an effective modality for the rehabilitation of the loss of skeletal muscle mass, maximum strength, and peak aerobic capacity resulting from disuse, regardless of the order in which the modes of exercise are performed.((PMID:27089330))miRNAs have been widely investigated in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, little is known about their effects on bird growth. Here we characterized the promoter of miR-206 in chicken and found that the preferable promoter was located in 1200 bp upstream of pri-miR-206. In this region, many key transcription factors, including MyoD, c-Myb, CEBPα/β, AP-4, RAP1, Brn2, GATA-1/2/3, E47, Sn, upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and CdxA, were predicted to bind and interact with miR-206 promoter. Overexpression of MyoD sharply increased miR-206 expression in both fibroblast and myoblast cells, and also the regulation in the myoblast cells was much stronger, indicating that miR-206 was regulated by MyoD combined with other muscle specific transcriptional factors. Aiming to further investigate the relationship between miR-206 mutation and transcriptional expression, total of 23 SNPs were identified in the two distinct bird lines by sequencing. Interestingly, the motif bound by MyoD was individually destroyed by G-to-C mutation located at 419 bp upstream of miR-206 precursor. Co-transfecting MyoD and miR-206 promoter in DF-1 cells, the luciferase activity of promoter containing homozygous GG types was significantly higher than CC ones (p < 0.05). Thus, this mutation caused low expression of miR-206. Consistently, eight variants including G-419C mutation exhibited a great effect on birthweight through maker-trait association analysis in F2 population (p < 0.05). Additionally, the regulation of miR-206 on embryo muscle mass mainly by increasing MyoG and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) expression (p < 0.05) with little change in MyoD, TMEM8C and myosin heavy chain (MHC). In conclusion, our findings provide a novel mutation destroying the promoter activity of miR-206 in birds and shed new light to understand the regulation mechanism of miR-206 on the embryonic muscle growth.((PMID:26226650))Phenoloxidases (POs) play key roles in various physiological functions in insects, e.g., cuticular sclerotization, wound healing, egg tanning, cuticle formation and melanotic encapsulaction of pathogens. Previously, we identified five POs, designated As-pro-PO I-V, from the mosquito Armigeres subalbatus and demonstrated that the functions of As-pro-PO I, II and III, were associated with filarial parasite melanization, blood feeding and cuticle formation, respectively. In the present study, we delineate the dual functions of As-pro-PO V. We found that the level of As-pro-PO V mRNA in mosquitoes was significantly increased after microfilaria challenge or blood feeding, and decreased to normal level after oviposition. Knockdown of As-pro-PO V by dsRNA resulted in significant decreases in the degree of microfilaria melanization, egg chronic melanization rates and egg hatching rates in Ar. subalbatus. Further transfection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays verified the As-pro-PO V gene might regulated by both AP-1, a putative immune-related regulatory element and CdxA, a developmental regulatory element. The binding of AP-1 and CdxA motif with mosquito nuclear extracts was significantly enhanced after microfilaria challenge and blood-feeding in Ar. subalbatus, respectively. These results indicate that As-pro-PO V is a critical enzyme that is required for both an effective melanization immune response and egg chorion melanization in this mosquito.((PMID:25024040))Our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) had discovered a new locus at 8p23 (rs2738048) associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Chinese Han patients, implicating the DEFA gene family within this locus as susceptibility genes. However, it is still unknown whether there are additional variations within these genes associated with the disease susceptibility. The aim of this study is to investigate the polymorphisms of DEFA genes in the susceptibility to IgAN and explore possible disease mechanisms. Sixteen tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) were selected for association study in 1,000 IgAN cases and 1,000 controls by using Sequenom MassArray system or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. We found seven SNPs within DEFA genes that were significantly associated with IgAN, including rs2738048 discovered in our previous GWAS (p = 0.0007, OR = 0.77) and additional 6 SNPs (rs2615787, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.74; rs2738081, p = 0.0003, OR = 0.72; rs2738058, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.73; rs4288398, p = 0.0008, OR = 0.78; rs6984215, p = 0.002, OR = 0.63; rs12716641, p = 0.00002, OR = 0.71). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase assays demonstrated that fragments containing rs2738048, rs2738081 and rs6984215 were transcription factor binding sites for CTF, SP1 and CdxA, respectively, and the allele status of rs2738048 and rs6984215 could significantly change the luciferase activity. These results suggest that polymorphisms within DEFA genes are involved in gene transcriptional regulation, and this may have some effect in mediating susceptibility to IgAN in southern Chinese.((PMID:24880497))This study examined the associations between vitamin D status, bone mineral content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and markers of calcium homeostasis in preschool-aged children. Children (n=488; age range: 1.8-6.0 y) were randomly recruited from Montreal. The distal forearm was scanned using a peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner (Lunar PIXI; GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). A subset (n=81) had clinical dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) scans (Hologic 4500A Discovery Series) of lumbar spine (LS) 1-4, whole body, and ultradistal forearm. All were assessed for plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone concentrations (Liaison; Diasorin), ionized calcium (ABL80 FLEX; Radiometer Medical A/S), and dietary vitamin D and calcium intakes by survey. Age (p<0.001) and weight-for-age Z-score (p<0.001) were positively associated with BMC and aBMD in all regression models, whereas male sex contributed positively to forearm BMC and aBMD. Having a 25(OH)D concentration of >75 nmol/L positively associated with forearm and whole body BMC and aBMD (p<0.036). Sun index related to (p<0.029) cDXA forearm and LS 1-4 BMC and whole-body aBMD. Nutrient intakes did not relate to BMC or aBMD. In conclusion, higher vitamin D status is linked to higher BMC and aBMD of forearm and whole body in preschool-aged children.((PMID:24287273))Helicobacter pylori encoded CagA is presently the only known virulence factor that is injected into gastric epithelial cells where it destroys apical junctional complexes and induces dedifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells, leading to H. pylori-related gastric carcinogensis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which CagA mediates these changes. Caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) is an intestine-specific transcription factor highly expressed in multistage tissues of dysplasia and cancer. One specific target of Cdx2, Claudin-2, is involved in the regulation of tight junction (TJ) permeability. In this study, our findings showed that the activity of Cdx2 binding to Cdx binding sites of CdxA (GTTTATG) and CdxB (TTTTAGG) of probes corresponding to claudin-2 flanking region increased in AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain. Moreover, Cdx2 upregulated claudin-2 expression at transcriptional level and translational level. In the meantime, we found that TJs of AGS cells, infected with CagA positive wild-type strain of H. pylori, compared to CagA negative isogenic mutant-type strain, were more severely destroyed, leading to wider cell gap, interference of contact, scattering and highly elevated migration of cells. Herein, this study is firstly demonstrated that H. pylori-encoded CagA disrupts TJs and induces invasiveness of AGS gastric carcinoma cells via Cdx2-dependent targeting of Claudin-2. This provides a new mechanism whereby CagA induced dedifferentiation of AGS cells, leading to malignant behavior of biology.((PMID:23612636))There are few large-scale studies on the utility of peripheral dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (pDXA) in children. As central dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (cDXA) equipment is not commonly available in the developing world, we assessed the correlation of bone mineral density (BMD) with cDXA and pDXA in children to determine the optimal Z-score thresholds of pDXA for predicting two predefined Z-score cutoffs (≤-1, ≤-2) of cDXA in 844 subjects (441 boys, 403 girls) aged 10-18 years. The BMD of antero-posterior lumbar spine (L1-L4), proximal femur and forearm was measured by cDXA, while the peripheral BMD of forearm and calcaneus was estimated using pDXA. The correlation was statistically significant at all sites (p<0.01). The coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.79 in boys and 0.17 to 0.32 in girls. A significant positive correlation was observed between BMD by pDXA and cDXA in Indian children, with a strong gender difference in both the extent of correlation and the ability of peripheral BMD to predict central BMD.((PMID:23534754))The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is a multifunctional cytokine-like molecule that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tumors. In this study, real-time polymerase chain reactions and Western blot assays indicated that HMGB1 transcriptional activity and protein level are increased in Tax+-T cells (TaxP). To clarify the mechanisms, a series of HMGB1 deletion reporter plasmids (pHLuc1 to pHLuc6) were transfected into Tax--T cells (TaxN, Jurkat) and Tax+-T cells (TaxP). We found that promoter activity in Tax+-T cells to be higher than that in Tax--T cells, indicating a significant increase in pHLuc6. Bay11-7082 (NF-κB inhibitor) treatment did not block the enhancing effect. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Tax was retained on a HMGB1 promoter fragment encompassing -1163 to -975. Bioinformatics analysis showed six characteristic cis-elements for CdxA, AP-1, AML-1a, USF, v-Myb, and C/EBP in the fragment in question. Mutation of cis- elements for C/EBP reduced significant HMGB1 promoter activity induced by Tax. These findings indicate that Tax enhances the expression of HMGB1 gene at the transcriptional level, possibly by interacting with C/EBP.((PMID:23454006))Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a multi-functional transcription factor in the IRF family exhibiting both transcriptional activating and repressing activities. In this study, an IRF-2 gene (HcIRF-2) from Hyriopsis cumingii was identified and characterized. The cDNA sequence consisted of 2688 bp, encoding a 329 amino acid-protein. The amino acid sequence had a highly conserved N-terminal DBD structure, containing characteristic repeats of six tryptophan residues. The 5'-flanking region contained several transcription regulation elements such as AP1, CdxA, HSF, NIT2 and HNF-3b. Nine SNPs were obtained through direct sequencing of HcIRF-2 from resistant and susceptible stock. Only +2365T/C SNP was significantly associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to Aeromonas hydrophila both in genotype (P = 0.021) and allele (P = 0.006) analysis. The SNPs +2248T/C and +2365T/C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that haplotype TT frequency in the resistant group was significantly higher than in the susceptible group. The mortality in +2248CC genotype individuals was significantly higher than in CT and TT genotype individuals. These results indicated that haplotype TT and genotype +2248CT and +2248GT individuals were resistant to A. hydrophila, which could make them potential markers in selective breeding of H. cumingii.((PMID:23208143))Based on the cDNA sequence of GPX in Hyriopsis cumingii, the complete genomic DNA of GPX gene and it's 5'-flanking region were identified from H. cumingii using PCR and genome walking technique. The length of the complete genomic sequence was 6 708 bp including the 5'-flanking region, two exons, and one intron. Sequence analysis of the 992 bp 5'-flanking region revealed that it contained a core promoter element (TATA-box) and other transcription regulation elements such as AP1, C/EBP, and CdxA. The sequence lengths of the two exons were 273 bp and 991 bp, respectively, and the intron was 4 491 bp in length. Sixteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the GPX gene from resistant stock (RS) and susceptible stock (SS) of H. cumingii. These polymorphisms were analyzed with regard to resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila. Among them, three SNPs including A-99G, A-86C, and A-49C in GPX promoter and five SNPs including A2841T, C2847T, G3146C, A3150G, and G4645T in GPX introns were associated with resistance/susceptibility of H. cumingii to A. hydrophila, both in genotype and allele frequency. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that A-86C, A-49C, C2847T, A3150G, G4645T, A2841T, and G3146C were in high linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of two major predominant haplotypes (ACTGT and TG) in the resistant group was significantly higher than that in the susceptible group. The results suggest that the polymorphic loci in the GPX gene could be potential genetic markers for future molecular selection of strains resistant to diseases.((PMID:22578123))Investigating intestinal physiology in vitro remains challenging due to the lack of an effective primary enterocyte culture system. Recently developed protocols for growing organoids containing crypts and villus from adult mouse intestinal epithelium in Matrigel present an attractive alternative to the classical techniques. However, these approaches require the use of sophisticated and expensive serum-free medium supplemented with epithelial growth factor (EGF), Wnt agonist (R-spondin 1), and bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor (Noggin) in high concentrations. Here we demonstrate that is possible to use an isolated chicken embryonic intestinal epithelium to create such an organoid culture. Structures formed in Matrigel matrix in the first two days following isolation survive and enlarge during ensuing weeks. They have the appearance of empty spheres and comprise cells expressing cytokeratin (an epithelial cell marker), villin (a marker of enterocytes), and Sox-9 (a transcription factor characteristic of progenitors and stem cells of intestinal crypts). With chicken embryonic tissue as a source of organoids, prostaglandin E2 is as effective as R-spondin 1 and Noggin in promoting sustained growth and survival of epithelial spheroids.((PMID:25049581))The production of therapeutic proteins from transgenic animals is one of the most important successes of animal biotechnology. Milk is presently the most mature system for production of therapeutic proteins from a transgenic animal. Specifically, β-casein is a major component of cow, goat and sheep milk, and its promoter has been used to regulate the expression of transgenic genes in the mammary gland of transgenic animals. Here, we cloned the porcine β-casein gene and analyzed the transcriptional activity of the promoter and intron 1 region of the porcine β-casein gene. Sequence inspection of the 5'-flanking region revealed potential DNA elements including SRY, CdxA, AML-a, GATA-3, GATA-1 and C/EBP β. In addition, the first intron of the porcine β-casein gene contained the transcriptional enhancers Oct-1, SRY, YY1, C/EBP β, and AP-1, as well as the retroviral TATA box. We estimated the transcriptional activity for the 5'-proximal region with or without intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene in HC11 cells stimulated with lactogenic hormones. High transcriptional activity was obtained for the 5'-proximal region with intron 1 of the porcine β-casein gene. The β-casein gene containing the mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) was also cloned from another individual pig. Promoter activity of the luciferase vector containing the mutant TATA box was weaker than the same vector containing the normal TATA box. Taken together, these findings suggest that the transcription of porcine β-casein gene is regulated by lactogenic hormone via intron 1 and promoter containing a mutant TATA box (CATAAAA) has poor porcine β-casein gene activity.((PMID:22232350))To examine whether PARK16, which was recently identified as a protective locus for Parkinson disease (PD) in Asian, white, and South American populations, is also associated with PD in the genetically homogeneous Ashkenazi Jewish population.Case-control study.A medical center affiliated with a university. Subjects  Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located between RAB7L1 and SLC41A1 were analyzed in 720 patients with PD and 642 controls, all of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.Haplotypes were defined and risk estimates were determined for each SNP and haplotype. Bioinformatic analysis defined the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and the transcription factor binding sites that are potentially affected by 2 of the tested SNPs.All tested SNPs were significantly associated with PD (odds ratios = 0.64-0.76; P = .0002-.014). Two of them, rs1572931 and rs823144, were localized to the putative promoter region of RAB7L1 and their sequence variations altered the predicted transcription factor binding sites of CdxA, p300, GATA-1, Sp1, and c-Ets-1. Only 0.4% of patients were homozygous for the protective rs1572931 genotype (T/T), compared with 3.0% among controls (P = 5 × 10(-5)). This SNP was included in a haplotype that reduced the risk for PD by 10- to 12-fold (P = .002-.01) in all patients with PD and in a subgroup of patients who do not carry the Ashkenazi founder mutations in the GBA or LRRK2 genes.Our data demonstrate that specific SNP variations and haplotypes in the PARK16 locus are associated with reduced risk for PD in Ashkenazim. Although it is possible that alterations in the putative promoter of RAB7L1 are associated with this effect, the role of other genes in this locus cannot be ruled out.((PMID:21948744))Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is a key element of D-type cyclin holoenzymes. It is involved in the regulation of the G1-phase of the cell cycle and is considered to be an important candidate gene for selection of body measurement traits through marker-assisted selection. We cloned the promoter sequence of this gene in bovines and found it to share high similarity with that of the human CDK6 promoter. A 2271-bp sequence upstream of the start codon in the bovine CDK6 5'-flanking sequence is rich in GC; it lacks consensus TATA or CAAT box, but it contains several MZF1 binding sites. Other potential cis-regulatory elements were found in the 5'-flanking region, including CdxA, SRY, p300, GATA-1, and deltaE. Allele frequencies were also analyzed in various cattle breeds (Qinchuan, Qinchuan improvement steers, Nanyang, Jiaxian red, Xia'nan, Luxi, Simmental and Luxi crossbred steers, and Xuelong) and association with a selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was calculated. The T-1075C SNP in the promoter was found to be significantly associated with body length and heart girth. This SNP marker was found to be significantly associated with body length and the heart girth in 737 individuals. We conclude that this SNP of the CDK6 gene has potential as a genetic marker for important body traits in bovine reproduction and breeding.((PMID:21191598))Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard method to assess bone mineral density (BMD). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends the measurement of BMD at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck, but in certain circumstances the 33% radius may be the recommended area to measure BMD. The aim of this study has been to analyze whether 33% radius should be considered the recommended area to assess BMD in prostate cancer patients.This is a retrospective study where BMD was assessed by DXA at 33% radius, lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck (cDXA) in 141 prostate cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients were hormone naïve while 113 were subjected to androgen suppression (AS) during the mean period of 29 months. Osteoporosis was diagnosed when T-score was lower than -2.5 and osteopenia when it ranged between -1 and -2.5.The osteoporosis rate was 29.8% at 33% radius, 23.4% at femoral neck, 19.9% at lumbar spine, and 12.8% at total hip. The overall osteoporosis rate at cDXA was 29.1%. Osteoporosis was detected in 52.2% at 33% radius and 36.2% at cDXA. Normal BMD was found in 17.7% at 33% radius and 34.8% at cDXA. The 33% radius was the only site where a significant increase in the osteoporosis rate was detected in patients subjected to AS compared to those hormone naïve (33 and 13.8%).The 33% radius seems more sensible than the central skeleton areas to detect bone mass loss in patients with prostate cancer.((PMID:20922565))Alkaline phosphatases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in many important biological processes. Mammalian tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase has long been thought to feature in embryonic development and bone formation. In this study, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) gene from Paralichthys olivaceus was identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and genome-walking PCR. The ALP gene extends 10,141 bp and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The open reading frame of the ALP transcript consists of 1,431 bp, which encodes 476 amino acids products named as POALP. An analysis of its secondary and tertiary structure revealed that the POALP was conserved in different species, but one disulfide linkage made it possible to adapt to low-temperature environment. The ALP activity was found to be first detectable in the embryo before hatching. The POALP was distributed ubiquitously in the body of P. olivaceus and was particularly high in the digestive tract. These findings suggest the potential role of POALP in nutrient absorption and transportation. During the pre-metamorphosis (F stage), ALP gene expression is 2.5-folds of that in the pro-metamorphosis (E stage); but in the post-metamorphosis (I stage), it was 1.8-folds of that of pro-metamorphosis. Exogenetic thyroxine (T4) and thiourea (TU) influenced the ALP gene expression significantly during the metamorphosis. Bioinformatics analysis showed that Japanese flounder ALP promoter region contained promoter sequence and putative recognition site for several transcriptional factors, including SREBP-1, SYR, and CdxA. In vitro promoter assays employing EGFP reporter system demonstrated that the promoter of ALP was active.((PMID:20190048))Prevotella bryantii B(1)4 is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and contributes to the degradation of hemicellulose in the rumen. The genome of P. bryantii harbors four genes predicted to encode glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 3 (GH3) enzymes. To evaluate whether these genes encode enzymes with redundant biological functions, each gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that the enzymes exhibit different substrate specificities. One gene encoded a cellodextrinase (CdxA), and three genes encoded beta-xylosidase enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B, and Xyl3C) with different specificities for either para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates or substituted xylooligosaccharides. To identify the amino acid residues that contribute to catalysis and substrate specificity within this family of enzymes, the roles of conserved residues (R177, K214, H215, M251, and D286) in Xyl3B were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation led to a severely decreased catalytic efficiency without a change in the overall structure of the mutant enzymes. Through amino acid sequence alignments, an amino acid residue (E115) that, when mutated to aspartic acid, resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX) with a concurrent 1.1-fold increase in the k(cat)/K(m) for pNP-beta-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) was identified. Amino acid residue E115 may therefore contribute to the discrimination between beta-xylosides and beta-glucosides. Our results demonstrate that each of the four GH3 enzymes has evolved to perform a specific role in lignopolysaccharide hydrolysis and provide insight into the role of active-site residues in catalysis and substrate specificity for GH3 enzymes.((PMID:20025925))More than ten bradykinin-related peptides and their cDNAs have been identified from amphibians, but their genes are unknown. In present study, four cDNAs encoding one, two, four and six copies of bradykinin-related peptides were cloned from the frog (Odorrana grahami) skin cDNA library, respectively. Three bradykinin-related peptides (bradykinin, Thr6-bradykinin, Leu5Thr6-bradykinin) were deduced from these four cDNA sequences. Based on the cDNA sequence, the gene sequence encoding an amphibian bradykinin-related peptide from O. grahami was determined. It is composed of 7481 base pairs including two exons and two introns. The first exon codes signal peptide and the second exon codes acidic spacer peptide and Thr6-bradykinin. The promoter region of the bradykinin gene contains several putative recognition sites for nuclear factors, such as SRY, GATA-1, LYF-1, DeltaE, CDXA, NKX-2.5, MIF1 and S8. The current work may facilitate to understand the regulation and possible functions of amphibian skin bradykinin-related peptides.((PMID:19826915))Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), an essential transcriptional regulator of the interferon genes, has been implicated in virus and double-stranded RNA mediated induction of IFN-α, IFN-β and RANTES, in virus-induced apoptosis and in tumor suppression. Promoter plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, but the characterization of the human IRF-3 promoter has not been systematically analyzed in HEK 293 cells. To characterize the human IRF-3 promoter, we have isolated a genomic clone of the human IRF-3 gene promoter region containing 1,000 nucleotides of the 5'- flanking region. Transient transfection of 5'-deleted promoter-reporter constructs and luciferase assay illustrated the region -149/-93 relative to the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for full promoter activity. This region contains HSF, E2F, CdxA and c-Myb transcription factor binding sites. The E2F sites are highly conserved among IRF-3 promoter regions of mouse, rat and human. Therefore, it was suggested that this E2F site may be essential for basal promoter activity. Surprisingly, mutation of this E2F site increased the promoter activity by 2-fold. Furthermore, overexpression of E2F1 reduced the transcription activity by 80%. These results indicated that human IRF-3 gene core promoter was located within the region -149/-93 relative to the TSS. E2F1 transcription factor negatively regulates human IRF-3 gene promoter.((PMID:19516907))Endoderm organ primordia become specified between gastrulation and gut tube folding in Amniotes. Although the requirement for RA signaling for the development of a few individual endoderm organs has been established a systematic assessment of its activity along the entire antero-posterior axis has not been performed in this germ layer.RA is synthesized from gastrulation to somitogenesis in the mesoderm that is close to the developing gut tube. In the branchial arch region specific levels of RA signaling control organ boundaries. The most anterior endoderm forming the thyroid gland is specified in the absence of RA signaling. Increasing RA in anterior branchial arches results in thyroid primordium repression and the induction of more posterior markers such as branchial arch Hox genes. Conversely reducing RA signaling shifts Hox genes posteriorly in endoderm. These results imply that RA acts as a caudalizing factor in a graded manner in pharyngeal endoderm. Posterior foregut and midgut organ primordia also require RA, but exposing endoderm to additional RA is not sufficient to expand these primordia anteriorly. We show that in chick, in contrast to non-Amniotes, RA signaling is not only necessary during gastrulation, but also throughout gut tube folding during somitogenesis. Our results show that the induction of CdxA, a midgut marker, and pancreas induction require direct RA signaling in endoderm. Moreover, communication between CdxA(+) cells is necessary to maintain CdxA expression, therefore synchronizing the cells of the midgut primordium. We further show that the RA pathway acts synergistically with FGF4 in endoderm patterning rather than mediating FGF4 activity.Our work establishes that retinoic acid (RA) signaling coordinates the position of different endoderm organs along the antero-posterior axis in chick embryos and could serve as a basis for the differentiation of specific endodermal organs from ES cells.((PMID:18448117))Gene regulation during development is an important biological activity that leads to synthesis of biomolecules at specific locations and specific times. The single tropomyosin gene of Caenorhabditis elegans, tmy-1/lev-11, produces four isoforms of protein: two from the external promoter and two from the internal promoter. We investigated the internal promoter of tropomyosin to identify sequences that regulate expression of tmy-1 in the pharynx and intestine. By promoter deletion of tmy-1 reporters as well as by database analyses, a 100-bp fragment that contained binding sequences for a GATA factor, for a chicken CdxA homolog, and for a forkhead factor was identified. Both the forkhead and CdxA binding sequences contributed to pharyngeal and intestinal expression. In addition, the GATA site also influenced intestinal expression of tmy-1 reporter. We showed that ELT-2 and PHA-4 proteins interact directly with the GATA and forkhead binding sequences, respectively, in gel mobility shift assays. RNA interference knockdown of elt-2 diminished tmy-1::gfp expression in the intestine. In contrast to RNA interference knockdown of pha-4, expression of tmy-1::gfp in pha-4;smg-1 mutants was slightly weaker than that of the wild type. Ectopic expression of PHA-4 and ELT-2 by heat shock was sufficient to elicit widespread expression of tmy-1::lacZ reporter in embryos. We found no indication of a synergistic relation between ELT-2 and PHA-4. Based on our data, PHA-4 and CdxA function as general transcription factors for pharyngeal and intestinal regulation of tmy-1. We present models by which ELT-2, PHA-4, and CdxA orchestrate expression from the internal promoter of tmy-1.((PMID:27673705))Agastache rugosa (Fisch. & C. A. Mey.) Kuntze has been well known for its antioxidative properties. In this study, we investigated the antimelanogenesis effect of demethyleugenol β-D-glucopyranoside (1) from Agastache rugosa by studying molecular regulation of melanogenesis in normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEMs) and in in vivo models. The SRY (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome)-related high-mobility group (HMG) box 9 (SOX9), one of critical factors that affect skin pigmentation is up-regulated. Interestingly, 1 downregulated the expression of SOX9 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Reduction of these two transcription factors resulted in a decrease in melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1, and dopachrome tautomerase. As a result, 1 significantly inhibited the melanin synthesis in melan-a mouse melanocytes and NHEMs. In addition, the antimelanogenic effect of 1 was confirmed in the zebrafish and reconstructed skin tissue models. In conclusion, 1, as a potent SOX9 regulator ameliorates skin pigmentation.((PMID:27663623))The cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12) has been implicated as a potent stimulator of tissue degradation in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis. In patients with periodontitis, an increased level of IL-12 is found in serum and gingival crevicular fluid. As inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated to induce activation of the immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), this study aimed to investigate the influence of IL-12 on these properties in human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells.Human PDL cells were isolated from periodontal tissue and incubated with 0-10 ng/mL of IL-12 for 24 h. The levels of expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), as well as of the stem cell markers, CD73, CD90 and CD105, were assessed by quantitative PCR. The level of IFN-γ protein was measured by ELISA, and IDO activity was measured by activity assay. The participation of IFN-γ in the expression of IDO and HLA-G was analyzed using neutralizing antibody against IFN-γ.IL-12 upregulated the expression of IFN-γ in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-12 induced the expression of the immunomodulatory proteins IDO and HLA-G via an IFN-γ-dependent pathway, as indicated by experiments using an IFN-γ neutralizing antibody. Addition of exogenous IFN-γ upregulated the expression of HLA-G and IDO. Expression of the stem cell markers CD73, CD90 and CD105, as well as the pluripotent markers Nanog homeobox, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 and SRY-box 2, were also upregulated in IL-12-treated hPDL cells. Finally, IL-12 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of the hPDL cells and preserved the self-clonal expansion property of these cells, as assessed by Alizarin Red S staining and the colony-forming unit assay.Expression of IL-12 during periodontitis may play an important role in the control of the inflammatory response via the induction of immunosuppressive molecules by hPDL cells. We hypothesize that this immunomodulatory property of IL-12 will serve as a protective mechanism to preserve a population of stem cells under inflammatory conditions.((PMID:27656215))Purpose. To track the fate of micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) labeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vivo in a rat myocardial infarction model using 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. Materials and Methods. Male MSCs (2 × 10(6)/50 μL) dual-labeled with MPIO and CM-DiI were injected into the infarct periphery 7 days after myocardial infarction (MI). The control group received cell-free media injection. The temporal stem cell location, signal intensity, and cardiac function were dynamically assessed using a 7T MRI at 24 h before transplantation (baseline), 3 days, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after transplantation, respectively. Results. MR hypointensities caused by MPIOs were observed on T2(⁎)-weighted images at all time points after MSCs injection. Cine-MRI showed that MSCs moderated progressive left ventricular remodeling. Double staining for iron and CD68 revealed that most of the iron-positive cells were CD68-positive macrophages. Real-time PCR for rat SRY gene showed the number of survival MSCs considerably decreased after transplantation. MSC-treated hearts had significantly increased capillary density in peri-infarct region and lower cardiomyocytes apoptosis and fibrosis formation. Conclusions. Iron particles are not a reliable marker for in vivo tracking the long-term fate of MSCs engraftment. Despite of poor cell retention, MSCs moderate left ventricular remodeling after MI.((PMID:27654689))Accurate mouse sexing is vital when conducting research examining sexual dimorphisms. Late fetal and newborn mouse pups are more immature than many previously described sexing methods allow. This study compares the sexing accuracy of a newly described internal gonad sexing method to a recently described peritoneal pigmentation sexing method in embryonic day 20 C57BL/6J mouse pups, using Sry genotyping to confirm the sex. The internal gonad sexing method was found to be highly accurate, while the peritoneal pigmentation method was slightly less accurate. Therefore, while Sry genotyping remains the gold standard, immediate and less expensive sexing methods can be performed accurately as early as the late fetal period in C57BL/6J mice.((PMID:27648416))In Algeria, the data on infertility and its various causes are rare. Recently, the introduction of assisted reproduction has allowed expecting that 300000 couples, which represent 7% of couples of reproductive age, face difficulty conceiving a child. Knowing that most idiopathic cases are likely to be due to chromosomal abnormalities, we aimed to investigate genetic defects by karyotype analysis in Algerian infertile men, using peripheral blood lymphocytes.A cytogenetic study was conducted on 10 men from infertile couples by Karyotype analysis of R-banding performed by lymphocyte culture technique. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed and molecular abnormalities were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were evaluated by immunoradiometric method.Chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 30% of the patients. We identified a homogenous Klinefelter syndrome patient with 47, XXY karyotype, a mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patient with 47, XXY/46, XY karyotype and a 46, XX male. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the sex-determining region Y was translocated to the short arm of the X chromosome in patient with 46, XX chromosomal constitution and the presence of the SRY gene was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis.The occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities in 30% of the infertile men strongly supports the inclusion of routine cytogenetic testing for diagnostic establishment and suitable counseling for couples seeking for assisted reproduction technologies.((PMID:27644460))Lissencephaly is one of the central nervous system anomalies of Miller-Dieker Syndrome (MDS). Fetuses with lissencephaly have an abnormal smooth brain with fewer folds and grooves which will be detected by ultrasounds or fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 30 weeks of gestation. We report a fetus with lissencephaly diagnosed as Miller-Dieker syndrome postnatally. G banded chromosome analysis revelaed 45,X,psu dic(17;Y)(p13;p11.32).ish dic (17;Y)(LIS1-,RARA+, SRY+, DYZ3+) by G-banding analysis using high resolution banding technique. Fetal delayed cortical development will be the findings to perform further investigations including FISH analysis for MDS, a 17p13.3 microdeletion syndrome, pre/postnatally. This will be the first case of MDS with unbalanced translocation between deleted short arm of chromosome 17 and Y chromosome.((PMID:27643851))Macaca fascicularis fascicularis is distributed over a wide area of Southeast Asia. Thailand is located at the center of their distribution range and is the bridge connecting the two biogeographic regions of Indochina and Sunda. However, only a few genetic studies have explored the macaques in this region. To shed some light on the evolutionary history of M. f. fascicularis, including hybridization with M. mulatta, M. f. fascicularis and M. mulatta samples of known origins throughout Thailand and the vicinity were analyzed by molecular phylogenetics using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including the hypervariable region 1, and Y-chromosomal DNA, including SRY and TSPY genes. The mtDNA phylogenetic analysis divided M. f. fascicularis into five subclades (Insular Indonesia, Sundaic Thai Gulf, Vietnam, Sundaic Andaman sea coast, and Indochina) and revealed genetic differentiation between the two sides of the Thai peninsula, which had previously been reported as a single group of Malay peninsular macaques. From the estimated divergence time of the Sundaic Andaman sea coast subclade, it is proposed that after M. f. fascicularis dispersed throughout Southeast Asia, some populations on the south-easternmost Indochina (eastern Thailand, southern Cambodia and southern Vietnam at the present time) migrated south-westwards across the land bridge, which was exposed during the glacial period of the late Pleistocene epoch, to the southernmost Thailand/northern peninsular Malaysia. Then, some of them migrated north and south to colonize the Thai Andaman sea coast and northern Sumatra, respectively. The SRY-TSPY phylogenetic analysis suggested that male-mediated gene flow from M. mulatta southward to M. f. fascicularis was restricted south of, but close to, the Isthmus of Kra. There was a strong impact of the geographical factors in Thailand, such as the Isthmus of Kra, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Phuket ranges and Sundaland, on M. f. fascicularis biogeography and their hybridization with M. mulatta.((PMID:27641728))The aim of the present study was to prove that primary cells enriched with stem cells are more easily reprogrammed to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells than those with scarce numbers of stem cells.We surveyed the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in five primarily-isolated human deciduous teeth-derived dental pulp cells (HDDPC) with cytochemical staining to examine the possible presence of stem cells. Next, the expression of stemness-specific factors, such as OCT(Octumer-binding transcription factor)3/4, NANOG, SOX2(SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2), CD90, muscle segment homeodomain homeobox (MSX) 1, and MSX2, was assessed with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method. Finally, these isolated HDDPC were transfected with plasmids carrying genes coding Yamanaka factors to determine whether these cells could be reprogrammed to generate iPS cells.Of the five primarily-isolated HDDPC, two (HDDPC-1 and -5) exhibited higher degrees of ALP activity. OCT-3/4 expression was also prominent in those two lines. Furthermore, these two lines proliferated faster than the other three lines. The transfection of HDDPC with Yamanaka factors resulted in the generation of iPS cells from HDDPC-1 and -5.The number of cells with the stemness property of HDDPC differs among individuals, which suggests that HDDPC showing an increased expression of both ALP and OCT-3/4 can be more easily reprogrammed to generate iPS cells after the forced expression of reprogramming factors.((PMID:27638301))Histone acetylation regulated by class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a pivotal role in matrix-specific gene transcription and cartilage development. While we previously demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-455-3p is upregulated during chondrogenesis and can enhance early chondrogenesis, the mechanism underlying this process remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the effect of miR-455-3p on histone H3 acetylation and its role during cartilage development and degeneration. We observed that miR-455-3p was highly expressed in proliferating and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, while HDAC2 and HDAC8 were primarily expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Meanwhile, miR-455-3p suppressed the activity of reporter constructs containing the 3'-untranslated regions of HDAC2/8, inhibited HDAC2/8 expression and promoted histone H3 acetylation at the collagen 2 (COL2A1) promoter in human SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in increased expression of cartilage-specific genes and promoted glycosaminoglycan deposition. Moreover, TSA inhibited matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp13) expression and promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 in interleukin-1-treated primary mouse chondrocytes. Lastly, knockdown of HDAC2/3/8 increased SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9) and decreased Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-455-3p plays a critical role during chondrogenesis by directly targeting HDAC2/8 and promoting histone H3 acetylation, which raises possibilities of using miR-455-3p to influence chondrogenesis and cartilage degeneration.((PMID:27635402))Objectives. To investigate whether high glucose-induced oxidative stress is implicated in apoptosis of rat nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and abnormal expression of critical genes involved in the metabolic balance of extracellular matrix (ECM). Methods. NPCs were cultured with various concentrations of glucose to detect cell viability and apoptosis. Cells cultured with high glucose (25 mM) were untreated or pretreated with N-acetylcysteine or a p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated. Activation of p38 MAPK was measured by Western blot. The expression of ECM metabolism-related genes, including type II collagen, aggrecan, SRY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (Sox-9), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), was analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Results. High glucose reduced viability of NPCs and induced apoptosis. High glucose resulted in increased ROS generation and p38 MAPK activation. In addition, it negatively regulated the expression of type II collagen, aggrecan, Sox-9, and TIMP-1 and positively regulated MMP-3 expression. These results were changed by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine or SB 202190. Conclusions. High glucose might promote apoptosis of NPCs, trigger ECM catabolic pathways, and inhibit its anabolic activities, possibly through a p38 MAPK-dependent oxidative stress mechanism.((PMID:27634221))SRY-related high-mobility-group box 9 (Sox9) gene is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation. In this study, we identified the transcriptional factor ZNF606 as an interacting partner for Sox9 in cells. We further demonstrated that overexpression of ZNF606 inhibited the transcriptional activity of Sox9, while knockdown of ZNF606 increased Sox9-mediated transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ZNF606 prevents Sox9 binding to the enhancers of its target gene col2a1. Importantly, the interaction between ZNF606 and Sox9 was decreased during chondrocyte differentiation. Consistent with these findings, ZNF606 inhibited chondrocyte differentiation. Thus, our results demonstrate that ZNF606 acts as a novel Sox9 co-regulator that inhibits Sox9-mediated chondrocyte differentiation.((PMID:27627724))To establish a rabbit model for investigating the effects of intermittent cyclic mechanical tension (ICMT) on promoting degeneration of endplate cartilage.Forty New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to surgery and randomly divided into three equal groups as follows: control group (no treatment, n = 10), sham group (animals underwent a sham operation but were not subjected to mechanical tensile strain, n = 15) and loaded group (discs were subjected to 1.5 MPa external tensile loading by using an external loading device during the animals' daily activity, n = 15). Mechanical tensile strain was applied for 8 h/d. The animals were examined radiologically after 8 weeks treatment and then killed for removal of endplate cartilage tissue samples from their spines. Histological staining was performed to examine the morphology of endplate cartilage tissue. Multiple strategies were employed to examine degeneration of endplate cartilage and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway activation.After ICMT loading for 56 days, radiology revealed ossification, hyperosteogeny and stenosis in the intervertebral spaces. Examination of hematoxylin and eosin staining of sections of endplate cartilage showed significant damage as the load duration increased in the ICMT loading group. Expression of aggrecan (ACAN), type II collagen (COL-2A), SRY-related high mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX9) was down-regulated (FACAN = 21.515, P < 0.01; FCOL-2A = 6.670, P = 0.05; FSOX9 = 7.888, P < 0.05), whereas that of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) was up-regulated (FMMP13 = 14.120, P < 0.01) after ICMT. Western blot and immunofluorescence revealed that expression of protein was consistent with gene expression results. Additionally, ICMT loading can lead to NF-κB signaling pathway activation as well as degeneration of endplate cartilage.These experiments indicate that ICMT contributes to the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway in vivo and that the NF-κB signaling pathway further up-regulates MMP13, leading to degeneration of endplate cartilage.((PMID:27611865))Selenium toxicity to oviparous vertebrates is often attributed to selenomethionine (SeMet), which can biomagnify through maternal transfer. Although oxidative stress is implicated in SeMet toxicity, knowledge gaps remain in how SeMet causes characteristic spinal deformities. In the present study, we use the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) model to investigate the role of oxidative stress, cell death, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) on skeletal gene expression and SeMet toxicity, linking localization of cellular effects to observed abnormalities. Medaka embryos were treated with 2.5μM or 5μM SeMet for 24h at stage 25 (48h post fertilization). Post treatment, embryos were separated into normal, deformed (mild, moderate or severe), or dead categories. Dichlorofluorescein staining demonstrated oxidative stress in tails of embryos with observable spinal malformations. Furthermore, acridine orange staining for apoptosis identified significantly more dead cells in tails of treated embryos. Gene expression studies for the UPR suggest a potential role for CHOP (c/ebp homologous protein) induced apoptosis deformed embryos after 5μM SeMet, accompanied by a significant decrease in PDIA4 (protein disulfide isomerase A4) and no change in Dnajb9 (ER DNA J Domain-Containing Protein 4). This expression was distinct from the UPR induced by well-studied ER stress inducer, tunicamycin, which robustly activated CHOP, PDIA4 and Dnajb9. Finally, SeMet treatment significantly decreased transcripts of cartilage development, Sox9 (SRY box 9), while increasing Runx2 in deformed embryos, without altering Twist or Collagen 2a1. Results suggest that oxidative stress, the UPR and cell death play key roles in SeMet induced deformities and altered skeletal development factors.((PMID:27611740))The sex-determining gene SRY induces SOX9 expression in the testes of eutherian mammals via two pathways. SRY binds to testis-specific enhancer of Sox9 (TESCO) with SF1 to activate SOX9 transcription. SRY also up-regulates ER71 expression, and ER71 activates Sox9 transcription. After the initiation of testis differentiation, SOX9 enhances Amh expression by binding to its promoter with SF1. SOX8, SOX9 and SOX10, members of the SOXE gene family, also enhance the activities of the Amh promoter and TESCO. In this study, we investigated the regulation of these sexual differentiation genes in Tokudaia osimensis, which lacks a Y chromosome and the SRY gene. The activity of the AMH promoter was stimulated by SOXE genes and SF1. Mutant AMH promoters, with mutations in its SOX and SF1 binding sites, did not show significant activity by SOX9 and SF1. These results indicate that AMH expression was regulated by the binding of SOX9 and SF1. By contrast, SOXE genes could not enhance TESCO activity. These results indicate that TESCO enhancer activity was lost in this species. Furthermore, the activity of the SOX9 promoter was enhanced by ER71, indicating that ER71 may play an important role in the testis-specific expression of SOX9.((PMID:27604691))In a 46 XY individual, the presence of the Y chromosome harboring the testis-determining factor (SRY) triggers testis determination and differentiation. In a 46 XX individual, the absence of SRY and the activation of genes associated with the female pathway lead to ovarian development. The latter process has long been considered as a default pathway. However, recent studies have cast doubts on this dogma. Here, after a brief overview of the main steps of ovarian development, we focus on three genes WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 that are essential for ovarian determination, differentiation and/or maintenance. Special attention is paid to FOXL2 whose mutations are responsible for the blepharophimosis syndrome, often associated with female infertility, and for cancer. We highlight the cooperation of WNT4, RSPO1 and FOXL2 within a regulatory network and the need for further research to better understand their role in defining and maintaining ovarian identity.((PMID:27592376))A novel color-tunable phosphor Sr3Y(PO4)3:Ce(3+),Tb(3+) was synthesized through solid-state reaction method. Several techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, were used to investigate the obtained phosphors. Results of luminescence spectra and decay time measurements revealed that an efficient energy transfer occurred from Ce(3+) to Tb(3+) via a dipole-dipole mechanism, where Ce(3+) exhibited a strong excitation band in the near-ultraviolet region. CIE chromaticity coordinates were tuned from deep blue (0.162, 0.090) to green (0.230, 0.411) by adjusting the relative concentrations between Ce(3+) and Tb(3+) ions. Results revealed that the as-synthesized phosphors had color-tunable characteristics and can be used as promising materials in the field of phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes.((PMID:27588041))Constitutional translocations between sex chromosomes are rather rare in humans with breakpoints at Xp11 and Yq11 as the most frequent. Breakpoints on the short arm of the Y chromosome form one subgroup of t(X;Y), giving rise to a derived chromosome with the centromeres of both the X and Y chromosomes, dic(X;Y). Here, we report a rare congenital chromosomal aberration, 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32)[20]/45,X[10], in an adult male.Primary myelofibrosis, a malignant haematological disease, was diagnosed in a 63-year-old man following liver transplantation after hepatocellular carcinoma. By the analysis of the bone marrow sample, the karyotype 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32) was detected in all the mitoses analysed and verified with multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH). A cytogenetic examination of stimulated peripheral blood cells revealed the constitutional karyotype 46,X,dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32)[20]/45,X[10]. The cell line 45,X was confirmed with FISH in 35 % of interphase nuclei. The SRY locus was present on the dicentric chromosome. A CGH/SNP array (Illumina) revealed a gain of 153,7 Mbp of the X chromosome and a 803-kbp microdeletion (including the SHOX gene), which were also confirmed with FISH. SHOX encodes a transcriptional factor that regulates the growth of the long bones. The deletion of the SHOX gene together with the Madelung deformity of the forearm and the short stature of the proband led to a diagnosis of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD). The gain of almost the whole X chromosome (153,7 Mbp) was considered a variant of Klinefelter syndrome (KS). The levels of gonadotropins and testosterone were consistent with gonadal dysfunction. A malformation of the right external ear was detected.We have reported a structural aberration of the sex chromosomes, dic(X;Y)(p22.33;p11.32). The related genomic imbalance is associated with two known hereditary syndromes, LWD and a KS variant, identified in our proband at an advanced age. Because the breakpoints did not involve cancer genes, we inferred that the two malignancies in the proband were not caused by this abnormality. The possible influence of SHOX haploinsufficiency on the growth regulation of auricular chondrocytes is discussed.((PMID:27578009))Tissue engineering-based therapies rely on the delivery of monolayered fibroblasts on two-dimensional polystyrene-coated and extracellular matrix (ECM) surfaces to regenerate connective tissues. However, this approach may fail to mimic their three-dimensional (3D) native architecture and function. We hypothesize that ECM fibrous proteins, which direct the migration of cells in vivo, may attach and guide polystyrene- and Matrigel™-ECM (M-ECM)-adherent fibroblasts to rearrangement into large multicellular macrostructures with the ability to proliferate. Gingival monolayered fibroblasts and their derived spheroids were added and adhered to tissue culture polystyrene and M-ECM surfaces. The cells were covered with a layer of collagen1 hydrogel combined with vitronectin, fibronectin or fibrin, or 10% M-ECM. The development of 3D cell constructs was characterized by epifluorescence and confocal scanning microscope image analysis. The ECM turnover and the proliferative capabilities of the fibroblasts were determined via gene expression profiling of collagen1, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase/metallopeptidase 2, Nanog, and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box2 (Sox2). Expression of the Sox2 protein was followed by immunostaining. The collagen1 protein had the strongest effect on monolayered and spheroid cell rearrangements, forming large spherical shapes and fused 3D macroconstructs. The addition of fibrin protein was typically required to achieve a similar effect on M-ECM-adherent monolayered fibroblasts. The spheroid fusion process was followed by an increase in cell density and the formation of tight clusters. The fused spheroids continued to maintain their intracellular ECM turnover and proliferation capacities. Collagen1 is a valuable component in the rearrangement of adherent fibroblast monolayers and spheroids. Fibroblast spheroids should preferably be used as basic building blocks to assemble multicellular connective tissue-like macrostructures.((PMID:27576690))A general problem is posed by analysis of transcriptional thresholds governing cell-fate decisions in metazoan development. A model is provided by testis determination in therian mammals. Its key step-Sertoli-cell differentiation in the embryonic gonadal ridge-is initiated by SRY, a Y-encoded architectural transcription factor. Mutations in human SRY cause gonadal dysgenesis leading to XY female development (Swyer syndrome). Here, we have characterized an inherited mutation compatible with either male or female somatic phenotypes as respectively observed in an XY father and XY daughter. The mutation (a crevice-forming substitution at a conserved back surface of the SRY high-mobility-group box) markedly destabilizes the domain but preserves specific DNA affinity and induced DNA bend angle. On transient transfection of diverse human and rodent cell lines, the variant SRY exhibited accelerated proteasomal degradation (relative to wild-type) associated with increased ubiquitination; in vitro susceptibility to ubiquitin-independent (″default″) cleavage by the 20S core proteasome was unchanged. The variant's gene-regulatory activity (as assessed in a cellular model of the rat embryonic XY gonadal ridge) was reduced by twofold relative to wild-type SRY at similar levels of mRNA expression. Chemical proteasome inhibition restored native-like SRY expression and transcriptional activity in association with restored occupancy of a sex-specific enhancer element in principal downstream gene Sox9, demonstrating that the variant SRY exhibits essentially native activity on a per-molecule basis. Our findings define a novel mechanism of impaired organogenesis: accelerated ubiquitin-directed proteasomal degradation of a master transcription factor leading to a developmental decision poised at the edge of ambiguity.((PMID:27563746))In this commentary we briefly summarize early work on circular RNAs derived from spliceosome mediated circularization. We highlight how this early work inspired work on the basic mechanisms of nuclear RNA splicing, the possible function of circular RNAs and the potential uses of circular RNAs as tools in biomedicine. Recent developments in the study of circular RNAs, summarized in this volume, have brought these questions back to the foreground.((PMID:27536700))The SRY gene (SRY) provides instructions for making a transcription factor called the sex-determining region Y protein. The sex-determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In this study, SRY of 15 spices included of human, chimpanzee, dog, pig, rat, cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, horse, zebra, frog, urial, dolphin and killer whale were used for determine of bioinformatic differences.Nucleotide sequences of SRY were retrieved from the NCBI databank. Bioinformatic analysis of SRY is done by CLC Main Workbench version 5.5 and ClustalW (http:/www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and MEGA6 softwares.The multiple sequence alignment results indicated that SRY protein sequences from Orcinus orca (killer whale) and Tursiopsaduncus (dolphin) have least genetic distance of 0.33 in these 15 species and are 99.67% identical at the amino acid level. Homosapiens and Pantroglodytes (chimpanzee) have the next lowest genetic distance of 1.35 and are 98.65% identical at the amino acid level.These findings indicate that the SRY proteins are conserved in the 15 species, and their evolutionary relationships are similar.((PMID:27264816))To investigate the phenotype-genotype association of isodicentromere Y chromosome by analysis of two female patients carrying the chromosome with sexual development disorders.The karyotypes of the two patients were determined by application of conventional G banding of peripheral blood samples and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR was applied to detect the presence of SRY gene.Conventional karyotype analysis showed case 1 to be a mosaic: mos.45,X[38]/46,X,+mar[151]/47,XY,+mar[5]/47,X,+mar × 2[2]/46,XY[4], FISH showed that 12 different cell lines were presented in the karyotype of case 1 and partial cell lines with SRY gene, the marker is an isodicentromere Y chromosome [idic(Y)(p)]. No mutation was found in the SRY gene. The karyotype of case 2 was mos.45,X[25]/46,X,+mar[35]. FISH showed the marker to be an idic(Y)(p) without the SRY gene.The karyotype of patients carrying idic(Y)(p) seems unstable, and female patients have the characteristics of short stature and secondary sexual hypoplasia. Karyotype analysis combined with FISH analysis can accurately determine the breakpoint of idic(Y) and identify the types of complex mosaic, which may facilitate genetic counseling and prognosis.((PMID:26823431))The mammalian Y chromosome is considered a symbol of maleness, as it encodes a gene driving male sex determination, Sry, as well as a battery of other genes important for male reproduction. We previously demonstrated in the mouse that successful assisted reproduction can be achieved when the Y gene contribution is limited to only two genes, Sry and spermatogonial proliferation factor Eif2s3y. Here, we replaced Sry by transgenic activation of its downstream target Sox9, and Eif2s3y, by transgenic overexpression of its X chromosome-encoded homolog Eif2s3x. The resulting males with no Y chromosome genes produced haploid male gametes and sired offspring after assisted reproduction. Our findings support the existence of functional redundancy between the Y chromosome genes and their homologs encoded on other chromosomes.((PMID:26719889))Spermatogenesis is a key developmental process allowing for a formation of a mature male gamete. During its final phase, spermiogenesis, haploid round spermatids undergo cellular differentiation into spermatozoa, which involves extensive restructuring of cell morphology, DNA, and epigenome. Using mouse models with abrogated Y chromosome gene complements and Y-derived transgene we identified Y chromosome encoded Zfy2 as the gene responsible for sperm formation and function. In the presence of a Zfy2 transgene, mice lacking the Y chromosome and transgenic for two other Y-derived genes, Sry driving sex determination and Eif2s3y initiating spermatogenesis, are capable of producing sperm which when injected into the oocytes yield live offspring. Therefore, only three Y chromosome genes, Sry, Eif2s3y and Zfy2, constitute the minimum Y chromosome complement compatible with successful intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the mouse.((PMID:26672550))((PMID:26651950))Simple and precise methods for sex determination in animals are a pre-requisite for a number of applications in animal production and forensics. Some of the existing methods depend only on the detection of Y-chromosome specific sequences. However, the detection of Y and X-chromosome specific sequences is advantageous. In the present study the accuracy of sex determination by SRY (sex-determining region Y) and AMEL (Amelogenin) gene detection was assessed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of DNA extracted from free fetal cells in maternal blood, which is noninvasive for fetus and easier to collect. The PCR amplification of SRY primers produced a single band of 171bp from ewes bearing a male fetus, whereas no band was amplified from the DNA extracted from ewes pregnant to a female fetus. Moreover, two bands of 182 and 242bp in male and a single band of 242 in female fetuses were produced by AMEL gene primers in the PCR reaction. Using this technique 100% of samples were successfully sexed, excluding twins. In conclusion, we demonstrated that sex determination using DNA of free fetal cells in maternal plasma is efficient using both SRY and AMEL gene sequences. It also is evident that this method is not suitable for sex determination of twin pregnancies.((PMID:26617765))This study was initiated to investigate the efficacy of myocardial fibrosis intervention via signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling using bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in which being over-expressed with the aid of bispecific antibody (BiAb) and ultrasound-mediated microbubbles (MB). BiAb was prepared and combined with isolated MSC with CD47 overexpression from male mice and trans-fused into female mice with isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis via the tail vein, followed by MB. This study included five groups. Five weeks after treatment, expression levels of the sex-determining region of Y-chromosome (SRY), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in myocardium were detected by fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression of signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT 3 was detected by Western blot.The highest homing number of MSC was in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB group, second highest in the CD47 + MSC + BiAb group, and lowest in MSC alone. Compared with the Control group, CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB, CD47 + MSC + BiAb, CD47 + MSC and MSC groups had decreased levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, STAT 1 and collagen deposition, and increased levels of STAT 3. Up regulated STAT 3 and down regulated TIMP-1 were significantly different in CD47 + MSC + BiAb + MB compared with CD47 + MSC or CD47 + MSC + BiAb.CD47 can enhance the homing rate and repairing efficacy of MSC. MSC can improve MMP-TIMP expression in injured myocardium and interfere with myocardial fibrosis after homing, a mechanism that may be related to the STAT-mediated signaling pathway.((PMID:26585458))This paper introduces a two-step cascade enrichment method for isolating nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in maternal blood. The two-step enrichment platform consists of a positive enrichment process based on a red blood cell (RBC) hyperaggregation method and a negative enrichment process using microfluidic technology. An analytical evaluation using blood samples from patients with leukemia showed that the while blood cell (WBC) depletion and NRBC loss rates of the positive enrichment process were 93.98 % and 6.02 %, respectively. Through the two-step cascade enrichment method, 1-396 NRBCs and only 0-6 WBCs were isolated from 1 mL of 18 maternal blood samples. Experimental results also showed that the WBC depletion rate of the proposed two-step method was more than 625,000-fold, and the purity of enriched NRBCs ranged from 20 % to 100 %. Furthermore, SRY (the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) genes were detected in enriched NRBCs, thereby demonstrating that enriched NRBCs contain fetus-derived NRBCs.((PMID:26582524))Gonadoblastoma (GB), a rare in situ germ cell tumor derived from sex cord and germ cells, is closely associated with gonadal dysgenesis. About 80% of GB individuals exhibit 46, XY female phenotype while the others are 45, XY and 46, XX with disorders of sex development. Moreover, 35% of GB can eventually develop into malignant tumors, such as seminoma and dysgerminoma tumors. The molecular genetic mechanism of GB remains to be fully uncovered due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Increasing studies show that the formation of GB is closely related to genes regulating sexual differentiation and determination (e.g., SRY, WT1, SOX9, Foxl2, TSPY, etc), and is affected by the interaction of genetic and epigenetic regulation. Here we describe the clinical and pathological features, diagnosis and treatment of GB, and also summarize the molecular genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the gonadal abnormalities that lead to GB. We analyze and construct the common gene regulatory networks related to the development of GB, and describe some obstacles and deficiencies in current studies to provide innovative perspectives on further studying the pathological and molecular mechanisms of GB.((PMID:26444262))Sex determination in mammals requires expression of the Y-linked gene Sry in the bipotential genital ridges of the XY embryo. Even minor delay of the onset of Sry expression can result in XY sex reversal, highlighting the need for accurate gene regulation during sex determination. However, the location of critical regulatory elements remains unknown. Here, we analysed Sry flanking sequences across many species, using newly available genome sequences and computational tools, to better understand Sry's genomic context and to identify conserved regions predictive of functional roles.Flanking sequences from 17 species were analysed using both global and local sequence alignment methods. Multiple motif searches were employed to characterise common motifs in otherwise unconserved sequence.We identified position-specific conservation of binding motifs for multiple transcription factor families, including GATA binding factors and Oct/Sox dimers. In contrast with the landscape of extremely low sequence conservation around the Sry coding region, our analysis highlighted a strongly conserved interval of ~106 bp within the Sry promoter (which we term the Sry Proximal Conserved Interval, SPCI). We further report that inverted repeats flanking murine Sry are much larger than previously recognised.The unusually fast pace of sequence drift on the Y chromosome sharpens the likely functional significance of both the SPCI and the identified binding motifs, providing a basis for future studies of the role(s) of these elements in Sry regulation.((PMID:26418730))A single-born, 15-month-old Holstein cattle, diagnosed as hermaphrodite, was investigated for estrous cycle, hormonal profiles, karyotype, presence of SRY, as well as anatomopathological and histological aspects. Normal continuous estrous cycles and basal testosterone levels were reported. Necropsy showed the presence of a female genital tract that mismatched a vulvar opening and a male pelvic urethra continued within a penis. Moreover, we observed islands of seminiferous tubules with the presence of germline cells, 2 pampiniform plexi, the corpus cavernosum, the penile urethra, the corpus spongiosum and the glans. Cytogenetic analyses of the blood cells showed an XX karyotype, while the molecular analyses revealed the presence of the SRY gene in several tissues, including blood. This is the first report in the scientific literature of an SRY-positive hermaphrodite Holstein cattle with continuous ovarian cycles.((PMID:26401661))Gonadal sex in most mammals is determined based on sex differentiation of the supporting cell lineages. In mouse XY gonads, SRY induces SOX9 upregulation and subsequent FGF9 expression by embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), leading to the differentiation of Sertoli cells. XX gonads, lacking SRY action, start on the ovarian program through the actions of WNT4 and FOXL2 from around E11.5-12.0. These 2 ovarian factors, together with retinoic acid (RA) action, promote feminization partially through the repression of the masculinizing activities of SOX9, FGF9 and DMRT1. RA initiates meiosis in female germ cell cysts, in which intercellular bridges between interconnected germ cells rapidly undergo cyst breakdown by E17.5. Ovarian morphogenesis is characterized by continuous recruitment of pre-granulosa progenitor cells from the coelomic epithelia during the embryonic stage, which results in the formation of ovigerous cords and tight packing of non-interconnected oocytes (i.e. oocyte nests) at the perinatal stages. At birth, the oocyte nests break down into single oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells, leading to the assembly of primordial follicles. This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular and cellular events of initial ovarian differentiation, meiotic initiation, germ cell nest breakdown, and primordial follicle formation based on anatomical and morphogenetic aspects.((PMID:26219507))Animal researches and clinical studies have supported the relevance between phthalates exposure and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). These disorders may comprise common origin in fetal life, especially during sex determination and differentiation, where the mechanism remains unclear. The present study evaluated the disturbances in gene regulatory networks of sex determination in fetal mouse by in utero Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure. Temporal expression of key sex determination genes were examined during the critical narrow time window, using whole-mount in situ hybridization and quantitative-PCR. DEHP exposure resulted in significant reduction in mRNA of Sry during sex determination from gestation day (GD) 11.0 to 11.5 in male fetal mice, and the increasing of Sry expression to threshold level on GD 11.5 was delayed. Meanwhile, Gadd45g and Gata4, the upstream genes of Sry, and downstream gene Sox9 were also significantly downregulated in expression. In fetal females, the expression of Wnt4 and beta-catenin were up-regulated by DEHP exposure. Taken together, the results suggest that the potential mechanism of gonadal development disorder by DEHP may origin from repression of important male sex determination signaling pathway, involving Gadd45g → Gata4 → Sry → Sox9. The results would promote a better understanding of the association between phthalate esters (PAEs) exposure and the reductive disorder.((PMID:26184845))The SOX gene family includes many genes that play a determinant role in several developmental pathways. The SOX9 gene has been identified as a major factor in testis development in mammals after it is activated by the SRY gene. However, duplication of the gene itself in some mammalian species, or of a well-delimited upstream 'RevSex' region in humans, has been shown to result in testis development in the absence of the SRY gene. In the current study, we present an accurate analysis of the genomic organization of the SOX9 locus in dogs by both in silico and FISH approaches. Contrary to what is observed in the current dog genome assembly, we found that the genomic organization is quite similar to that reported in humans and other mammalian species, including the position of the RevSex region in respect to SOX9. The analysis of the conserved sequences within this region in 7 mammalian species facilitated the highlighting of a consensus sequence for SRY binding. This new information could help in the identification of evolutionarily conserved elements relevant for SOX9 gene regulation, and could provide valid targets for mutation analysis in XY DSD patients.((PMID:26121024))Diagnosis of fetal gender early in pregnancy is very useful as it would prevent invasive fetal sampling in almost half the cases at risk of inheriting X-linked disorders or those affecting sexual differentiation. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using circulating cell-free fetal (cff) DNA from maternal circulation has emerged as a useful alternative to existing methods for prenatal diagnosis of gender. NIPD eliminates the risk of miscarriage from invasive prenatal diagnosis and the necessity of possessing specialized obstetric skills for fetal tissue sampling. The aim of this study was to compare two Y chromosome markers-SRY and DYS14-for their utility in the diagnosis of fetal gender.Forty-eight plasma samples from pregnant women between 9 and 25 weeks of gestation were analyzed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on cff DNA extracted from maternal plasma to detect fetal Y chromosome with SRY (n=27) and DYS14 (n=48) markers.We observed 100% sensitivity and 85.6% specificity in noninvasive Y chromosome detection with the combined use of DYS14 and SRY markers (n=27) compared with the results obtained on using DYS14 (n=48 sensitivity 94%; specificity 71.4%) and SRY (n=27, sensitivity 84%; specificity 92.8%) markers alone.Our results show that the test performance improved with the employment of two Y-amplification assays.((PMID:26108792))Sex-reversal cases in humans and genetic models in mice have revealed that the fate of the bipotential gonad hinges upon the balance between pro-testis SOX9 and pro-ovary beta-catenin pathways. Our central query was: if SOX9 and beta-catenin define the gonad's identity, then what do the gonads become when both factors are absent? To answer this question, we developed mouse models that lack either Sox9, beta-catenin, or both in the somatic cells of the fetal gonads and examined the morphological outcomes and transcriptome profiles. In the absence of Sox9 and beta-catenin, both XX and XY gonads progressively lean toward the testis fate, indicating that expression of certain pro-testis genes requires the repression of the beta-catenin pathway, rather than a direct activation by SOX9. We also observed that XY double knockout gonads were more masculinized than their XX counterpart. To identify the genes responsible for the initial events of masculinization and to determine how the genetic context (XX vs. XY) affects this process, we compared the transcriptomes of Sox9/beta-catenin mutant gonads and found that early molecular changes underlying the XY-specific masculinization involve the expression of Sry and 21 SRY direct target genes, such as Sox8 and Cyp26b1. These results imply that when both Sox9 and beta-catenin are absent, Sry is capable of activating other pro-testis genes and drive testis differentiation. Our findings not only provide insight into the mechanism of sex determination, but also identify candidate genes that are potentially involved in disorders of sex development.((PMID:26083441))This report describes a disorder of the sexual development in a beagle dog resulting in an intersex condition. A 6 mo old beagle was presented for evaluation of a protruding structure from the vulva consistent with an enlarged clitoris. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the presence of both gonadal and uterine structures. Retrograde cystourethrovaginogram showed the presence of an os clitoris and severe vaginal stenosis. Histological studies revealed the presence of bilateral ovotestes and uterus. The gonad had interstitial cells within seminiferous-like tubules lined only with Sertoli cells and abundant interstitial cells among primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. Hormone assays completed before and after gonadohysterectomy showed an elevation in the levels of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone that returned to baseline 3 mo after surgery. Testosterone levels that were within the male reference ranges before surgery decreased to basal levels postsurgically. 17-β-Estradiol levels showed little variation and values were always within the reference ranges for a male. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal female karyotype (2n = 78, XX) and polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the absence of the sex-determining region Y gene. In summary, the dog presented bilateral ovotestes and a 2n = 78, XX chromosomal complement lacking the sex determining region Y gene, consistent with a diagnosis of true hermaphroditism.((PMID:26013162))The acquisition of stemness is a hallmark of aggressive human hepatocellular carcinoma (hHCC). The stem cell marker OCT4 is frequently expressed in HCCs, and its expression correlates with those of putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers and CSC properties. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of CSC maintenance by SRY through OCT4. We previously reported that Sry is involved in tumor malignancy in rodent HCCs. However, the oncogenic function of SRY in hHCCs is poorly understood. Ectopic expression of SRY increased multiple stem cell factors, including OCT4 and CD13. The OCT4 promoter contained SRY-binding sites that were directly activated by SRY. In HCC-derived cells, SRY knockdown decreased OCT4 expression and cancer stem-like phenotypes such as self-renewal, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity. Conversely, OCT4 and SRY overexpression promoted cancer stem-like phenotypes. OCT4 knockdown in SRY clones downregulated the self-renewal capacity and chemoresistance. These data suggest that SRY is involved in the maintenance of cancer stem-like characteristics through OCT4. Moreover, CSCs of HCC-derived cells differentiated into Tuj1-positive neuron-like cells by retinoic acid. Noteworthily, SRY was highly expressed in some hHCC patients. Taken together, our findings imply a novel therapeutic strategy against CSCs of hHCCs.((PMID:20301589))Nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular disorders of sex development (46,XX testicular DSD) are characterized by the presence of a 46,XX karyotype; male external genitalia ranging from normal to ambiguous; two testicles; azoospermia; and absence of Müllerian structures. Approximately 85% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present after puberty with normal pubic hair and normal penile size, but small testes, gynecomastia, and sterility resulting from azoospermia. Approximately 15% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD present at birth with ambiguous genitalia. Gender role and gender identity are reported as male. If untreated, males with 46,XX testicular DSD experience the consequences of testosterone deficiency.Diagnosis of nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD is based on the combination of clinical findings, endocrine testing, and cytogenetic testing. Endocrine studies usually show hypergonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to testicular failure. Cytogenetic studies at the 550-band level demonstrate a 46,XX karyotype. SRY, the gene that encodes the sex-determining region Y protein, is the principal gene known to be associated with 46,XX testicular DSD. Approximately 80% of individuals with nonsyndromic 46,XX testicular DSD are SRY positive as shown by use of FISH or chromosomal microarray (CMA). Rearrangements in or around SOX9 and SOX3 detected by CMA, or rarely karyotype, have recently been reported in a few cases; at least one more as-yet-unknown gene at another locus is implicated.Treatment of manifestations: Similar to that for other causes of testosterone deficiency. After age 14 years, low-dose testosterone therapy is initiated and gradually increased to reach adult levels. In affected individuals with short stature who are eligible for growth hormone therapy, testosterone therapy is either delayed or given at lower doses initially in order to maximize the growth potential. Reduction mammoplasty may need to be considered if gynecomastia remains an issue following testosterone replacement therapy. Treatment for osteopenia is by standard protocols. Providers are encouraged to anticipate the need for further psychological support. Surveillance: Monitor for testosterone effects during testosterone replacement therapy, including prostate size and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in adults; routine monitoring of hematocrit, lipid profile, and liver function tests; bone mineral density determination by bone densitometry (DEXA) annually, if osteopenia has been diagnosed. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contraindications to testosterone replacement therapy include prostate cancer (known or suspected) and breast cancer; oral androgens such as methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone should not be given because of liver toxicity.SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is generally not inherited because it results from de novo abnormal interchange between the Y chromosome and the X chromosome, resulting in the presence of SRY on the X chromosome and infertility. When SRY is translocated to another chromosome or when fertility is preserved, sex-limited autosomal dominant inheritance is observed. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been documented for familial cases thought to be caused by CNV in or around SOX9. The mode of inheritance of other SRY-negative 46,XX testicular DSD is not known, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been postulated. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at risk for SRY-positive 46,XX testicular DSD is possible.((PMID:25875750))((PMID:23583561))The characterisation of the pleiotropic effects of coat colour-associated mutations in mammals illustrates that sensory organs and nerves are particularly affected by disorders because of the shared origin of melanocytes and neurocytes in the neural crest; e.g. the eye-colour is a valuable indicator of disorders in pigment production and eye dysfunctions. Disorders related to coat colour-associated alleles also occur in the skin (melanoma), reproductive tract and immune system. Additionally, the coat colour phenotype of an individual influences its general behaviour and fitness. Mutations in the same genes often produce similar coat colours and pleiotropic effects in different species (e.g., KIT [reproductive disorders, lethality], EDNRB [megacolon] and LYST [CHS]). Whereas similar disorders and similar-looking coat colour phenotypes sometimes have a different genetic background (e.g., deafness [EDN3/EDNRB, MITF, PAX and SNAI2] and visual diseases [OCA2, RAB38, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TRPM1 and TYR]). The human predilection for fancy phenotypes that ignore disorders and genetic defects is a major driving force for the increase of pleiotropic effects in domestic species and laboratory subjects since domestication has commenced approximately 18,000 years ago.((PMID:26943473))The mechanisms linking sleep disordered breathing with impairment of sleep and bone metabolism/architecture are poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of the neuropeptide orexin, a respiratory homeostasis modulator, in growth retardation induced in an upper airway obstructed (AO) rat model.The tracheae of 22-day-old rats were narrowed; AO and sham-control animals were monitored for 5 to 7 w. Growth parameters, food intake, sleep/wake activity, and serum hormones were measured. After euthanasia, growth plate (GP) histology, morphometry, orexin receptors (OXR), and related mediators were analyzed. The effect of dual orexin receptor antagonist (almorexant 300 mg/kg) on sleep and GP histology were also investigated.The AO group slept 32% less; the time spent in slow wave and paradoxical sleep during light period and slow wave activity was reduced. The AO group gained 46% less body weight compared to the control group, despite elevated food intake; plasma ghrelin increased by 275% and leptin level decreased by 44%. The impediment of bone elongation and bone mass was followed by a 200% increase in OX1R and 38% reduction of local GP ghrelin proteins and growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a. Sry-related transcription factor nine (Sox9), a molecule mediating cartilage ossification, was downregulated and the level of transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma was upregulated, explaining the bone architecture abnormalities. Administration of almorexant restored sleep and improved GP width in AO animals.In AO animals, enhanced expression of orexin and OX1R plays a role in respiratory induced sleep and growth abnormalities.((PMID:25720524))Wnt signaling pathway activation plays a critical role in biological processes of tumor progression. SOX9 belongs to the sry-related high-mobility group box (SOX) family and is a key transcription factor in the development and differentiation of multiple cell lineages. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether suppression of Wnt signaling pathway by PPARγ gene affects target SOX9 gene expression. The pEGFP-N1-PPARγ overexpression recombinant plasmid was structured by molecular biology technology. The overexpression plasmid and empty vector pEGFP-N1 were transfected into three types of human gastric cancer cell lines, with different levels of differentiation, MKN-28, SGC-7901 and BGC-823. The PPARγ, β-catenin and SOX9 mRNA levels and proteins were examined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The pEGFP-N1-PPARγ recombinant plasmid was constructed and transfected into MKN-28, SGC-7901 and BGC-823 successfully. High expression of PPARγ (p < 0.05) for transfection recombinant plasmid group induced obviously decreased expression of β-catenin (p < 0.05), whereas SOX9 expression decreased significantly (p < 0.05) compared with the transfection empty vector group and normal comparison group. PPARγ can suppress β-catenin expression in Wnt signaling pathway and its downstream effector SOX9 expression in gastric cancer cells.((PMID:23826829))Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multipotent progenitor cells localized in the stromal compartment of the bone marrow (BM). The potential of MSC for mesenchymal differentiation has been well documented in different animal models predominantly on rodents. However, information regarding bovine MSC (bMSC) is limited, and the differentiation potential of bMSC derived from fetal BM remains unknown. In the present study we sought to isolate bMSC from abattoir-derived fetal BM and to characterize the multipotent and differentiation potential under osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic conditions by quantitative and qualitative analyses.Plastic-adherent bMSC isolated from fetal BM maintained a fibroblast-like morphology under monolayer culture conditions. These cells expressed high levels of MSC surface markers (CD73, CD90, and CD105) and low levels of hematopoietic surface markers (CD34 and CD45). Culture of bMSC under osteogenic conditions during a 27-day period induced up-regulation of the osteocalcin (OC) gene expression and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) activity, and promoted mineralization of the matrix. Increasing supplementation levels of ascorbic acid to culture media enhanced osteogenic differentiation of bMSC; whereas, reduction of FBS supplementation compromised osteogenesis. bMSC increased expression of cartilage-specific genes aggrecan (ACAN), collagen 2A1 (COL2A1) and SRY (sex-determining region Y) box 9 (SOX9) at Day 21 of chondrogenic differentiation. Treatment of bMSC with adipogenic factors increased levels of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (AP2) mRNA and accumulation of lipid vacuoles after 18 days of culture. NANOG mRNA levels in differentiating bMSC were not affected during adipogenic culture; however, osteogenic and chondrogenic conditions induced higher and lower levels, respectively.Our analyses revealed the potential multilineage differentiation of bMSC isolated from abattoir-derived fetal BM. NANOG mRNA pattern in differentiating bMSC varied according to differentiation culture conditions. The osteogenic differentiation of bMSC was affected by ascorbic acid and FBS concentrations in culture media. The simplicity of isolation and the differentiation potential suggest that bMSC from abattoir-derived fetal BM are appropriate candidate for investigating MSC biology and for eventual applications for regenerative therapy.((PMID:23333934))Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a plasticizer with endocrine disrupting properties that is found ubiquitously in the environment as well as in human amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, human milk, semen, and saliva. It is used in the industry to add flexibility to polyvinyl chloride-derived plastics and its wide spread use and presence has resulted in constant human exposure through fetal development and postnatal life. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between phthalate exposures and human reproductive effects in infant and adult populations. The effects of fetal exposure to phthalates on the male reproductive system were unequivocally shown on animal models, principally rodents, in which short term deleterious reproductive effects are well established. By contrast, information on the long term effects of DEHP in utero exposure on gonadal function are scarce, while its potential effects on other organs are just starting to emerge. The present review focuses on these novel findings, which suggest that DEHP exerts more complex and broader disruptive effects on the endocrine system and metabolism than previously thought. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "CSR 2013".((PMID:22531638))Brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) are a small population of cancer cells that exhibit self-renewal, multi-drug resistance, and recurrence properties. We have shown earlier that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists inhibit the expansion of BTSCs in T98G and U87MG glioma. In this study, we analysed the influence of PPARγ agonists on the expression of stemness and differentiation genes in BTSCs.The BTSCs were isolated from T98G and DB29 glioma cells, and cultured in neurobasal medium with epidermal growth factor+basic fibroblast growth factor. Proliferation was measured by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2 H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulphonate) and 3H thymidine uptake assays, and gene expression was analysed by quantitative reverse--transcription PCR and Taqman array. The expression of CD133, SRY box 2, and nanog homeobox (Nanog) was also evaluated by western blotting, immunostaining, and flow cytometry.We found that PPARγ agonists, ciglitazone and 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-ProstaglandinJ(2), inhibited cell viability and proliferation of T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. The PPARγ agonists reduced the expansion of CD133(+) BTSCs and altered the expression of stemness and differentiation genes. They also inhibited Sox2 while enhancing Nanog expression in BTSCs.These findings highlight that PPARγ agonists inhibit BTSC proliferation in association with altered expression of Sox2, Nanog, and other stemness genes. Therefore, targeting stemness genes in BTSCs could be a novel strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma.((PMID:19852756))PBP (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-binding protein) [Med1 (mediator 1)/TRAP220 (thyroid-hormone-receptor-associated protein 220)] is essential for mammary gland development. We established a mammary epithelial cell line with a genotype of PBPLoxP/LoxP by expressing an active form of Notch4. Null mutation of PBP caused severe growth inhibition of the Notch4-immortalized mammary cells. We found that truncated PBP without the two LXXLL motifs could reverse the growth inhibition due to the deficiency of endogenous PBP, indicating that signalling through nuclear receptors is unlikely to be responsible for the growth inhibition as the result of PBP deficiency. Loss of PBP expression was shown to completely ablate the expression of SOX10 [Sry-related HMG (high-mobility group) box gene 10]. The re-expression of SOX10 was capable of reversing the growth inhibition due to PBP deficiency, whereas suppressed expression of SOX10 inhibited the growth of Notch4-immortalized mammary cells. Further studies revealed PBP is directly recruited to the enhancer of the SOX10 gene, indicating that SOX10 is a direct target gene of PBP. We conclude that PBP is essential for the growth of Notch4-immortalized mammary cells by activating SOX10 expression, providing a potential molecular mechanism through which PBP regulates the growth of mammary stem/progenitor cells.((PMID:26109954))MicroRNA-124 contributes to neurogenesis through regulating its targets, but its expression both in the brain of Huntington's disease mouse models and patients is decreased. However, the effects of microRNA-124 on the progression of Huntington's disease have not been reported. Results from this study showed that microRNA-124 increased the latency to fall for each R6/2 Huntington's disease transgenic mouse in the rotarod test. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) staining of the striatum shows an increase in neurogenesis. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha protein levels in the striatum were increased and SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 9 protein level was decreased. These findings suggest that microRNA-124 slows down the progression of Huntington's disease possibly through its important role in neuronal differentiation and survival.((PMID:25049813))The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha protein, encoded by the PPARGC1A gene, plays an important role in energy homeostasis. The genetic variations within the PPARGC1A gene promoter region were scanned in 808 Chinese native bovines belonging to three cattle breeds and yaks. A total of 6 SNPs and one 4 bp insertion variation in the promoter region of the bovine PPARGC1A gene were identified: SNP -259 T>A, -301_-298insCTTT, -915 A>G, -1175 T>G, -1590 C>T, -1665 C>T and -1690 G>A, which are in the binding sites of some important transcription factors: sex-determining region Y (SRY), myeloid-specific zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) and octamer factor 1(Oct-1). It is expected that these polymorphisms may regulate PPARGC1A gene transcription and might have consequences at a regulatory level.((PMID:19625612))Stimulation of the mouse hindlimb via the sciatic nerve was performed for a 4-h period to investigate acute muscle gene activation in a model of muscle phenotype conversion. Initial force production (1.6 +/- 0.1 g/g body wt) declined 45% within 10 min and was maintained for the remainder of the experiment. Force returned to initial levels upon study completion. An immediate-early growth response was present in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (FOS, JUN, activating transcription factor 3, and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene) with a similar but attenuated pattern in the soleus muscle. Transcript profiles showed decreased fast fiber-specific mRNA (myosin heavy chains 2A and 2B, fast troponins T(3) and I, alpha-tropomyosin, muscle creatine kinase, and parvalbumin) and increased slow transcripts (myosin heavy chain-1beta/slow, troponin C slow, and tropomyosin 3y) in the EDL versus soleus muscles. Histological analysis of the EDL revealed glycogen depletion without inflammatory cell infiltration in stimulated versus control muscles, whereas ultrastructural analysis showed no evidence of myofiber damage after stimulation. Multiple fiber type-specific transcription factors (tea domain family member 1, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha and -beta, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha) increased in the EDL along with transcription factors characteristic of embryogenesis (Kruppel-like factor 4; SRY box containing 17; transcription factor 15; PBX/knotted 1 homeobox 1; and embryonic lethal, abnormal vision). No established in vivo satellite cell markers or genes activated in our parallel experiments of satellite cell proliferation in vitro (cyclins A(2), B(2), C, and E(1) and MyoD) were differentially increased in the stimulated muscles. These results indicated that the molecular onset of fast to slow phenotype conversion occurred in the EDL within 4 h of stimulation without injury or satellite cell recruitment. This conversion was associated with the expression of phenotype-specific transcription factors from resident fiber myonuclei, including the activation of nascent developmental transcriptional programs.((PMID:26046131))The RNA binding motif protein 38 (RBM38, also known as RNPC1) plays a pivotal role in regulating a wide range of biological processes, from cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest to cell myogenic differentiation. It was originally recognized as an oncogene, and was frequently found to be amplified in prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon carcinoma, esophageal cancer, dog lymphomas and breast cancer. In the present study, the complete RNPC1 gene was identified in a number of vertebrate genomes, suggesting that RNPC1 exists in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. In the different genomes, the gene had a similar 4 exon/3 intron organization, and all the genetic loci were syntenically conserved. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the RNPC1 gene from the mammalian, bird, reptile and teleost lineage formed a species-specific cluster. A total of 34 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 14 SNPs causing missense mutations, 8 exonic splicing enhancer SNPs and 12 SNPs causing nonsense mutations, were identified in the human RNPC1 gene. RNPC1 was found to be expressed in bladder, blood, brain, breast, colorectal, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian, skin and soft tissue cancer. In 14 of the 94 tests, an association between RNPC1 gene expression and cancer prognosis was observed. We found that the association between the expression of RNPC1 and prognosis varied in different types of cancer, and even in the same type of cancer from the different databases used. This suggests that the function of RNPC1 in these tumors may be multidimensional. The sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 5 (Sox5), runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), CCAAT displacement protein 1 (CUTL1), v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog (Rel)A, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ isoform 2 (PPARγ2) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) regulatory transcription factor binding sites were identified in the upstream (promoter) region of the RNPC1 gene, and may thus be involved in the effects of RNPC1 in tumors.((PMID:15699338))Chondrogenesis is a multistep pathway in which multipotential mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) differentiate into chondrocytes. The transcription factor Sox9 (SRY-related high mobility group-Box gene 9) regulates chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage-specific expression of genes, such as Col2a1 (collagen type II alpha1). However, Sox9 expression is detected not only in chondrogenic tissue but also in nonchondrogenic tissues, suggesting the existence of a molecular partner(s) required for Sox9 to control chondrogenesis and chondrogenic gene expression. Here, we report identification of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) as a coactivator for Sox9 during chondrogenesis. Expression of PGC-1alpha is induced at chondrogenesis sites during mouse embryonic limb development and during chondrogenesis in human MSC cultures. PGC-1alpha directly interacts with Sox9 and promotes Sox9-dependent transcriptional activity, suggesting that PGC-1alpha acts as a transcriptional coactivator for Sox9. Consistent with this finding, PGC-1alpha disruption in MSC by small interfering RNA inhibits Col2a1 expression during chondrogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of both PGC-1alpha and Sox9 induced expression of chondrogenic genes, including Col2a1, followed by chondrogenesis in the MSC and developing chick limb. Together, our results suggest a transcriptional mechanism for chondrogenesis that is coordinated by PGC-1alpha.((PMID:25482504))A recent paper demonstrated that decellularized extracellular matrix (DECM) deposited by synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs), especially from fetal donors, could rejuvenate human adult SDSCs in both proliferation and chondrogenic potential, in which expanded cells and corresponding culture substrate (such as DECM) were found to share a mutual reaction in both elasticity and protein profiles (see ref. (1) ). It seems that young DECM may assist in the development of culture strategies that optimize proliferation and maintain "stemness" of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), helping to overcome one of the primary difficulties in MSC-based regenerative therapies. In this paper, the effects of age on the proliferative capacity and differentiation potential of MSCs are reviewed, along with the ability of DECM from young cells to rejuvenate old cells. In an effort to highlight some of the potential molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we discuss age-related changes to extracellular matrix (ECM)'s physical properties and chemical composition.((PMID:26916619))Recent high-throughput studies revealed recurrent RUNX1 mutations in breast cancer, specifically in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) tumours. However, mechanisms underlying the implied RUNX1-mediated tumour suppression remain elusive. Here, by depleting mammary epithelial cells of RUNX1 in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate combinatorial regulation of AXIN1 by RUNX1 and oestrogen. RUNX1 and ER occupy adjacent elements in AXIN1's second intron, and RUNX1 antagonizes oestrogen-mediated AXIN1 suppression. Accordingly, RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate an ER-dependent correlation between RUNX1 and AXIN1 in tumour biopsies. RUNX1 loss in ER(+) mammary epithelial cells increases β-catenin, deregulates mitosis and stimulates cell proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. However, it does not stimulate LEF/TCF, c-Myc or CCND1, and it does not accelerate G1/S cell cycle phase transition. Finally, RUNX1 loss-mediated deregulation of β-catenin and mitosis is ameliorated by AXIN1 stabilization in vitro, highlighting AXIN1 as a potential target for the management of ER(+) breast cancer.((PMID:26706127))AML1-ETO is the most common fusion oncoprotein causing acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 24%. AML1-ETO functions as a rogue transcription factor, altering the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation. Currently, there are no specific therapies for AML1-ETO-positive AML. While known for decades to be the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22), it is not known how AML1-ETO achieves its native and functional conformation or whether this process can be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Here, we show that the biosynthesis and folding of the AML1-ETO protein is facilitated by interaction with the essential eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT). We demonstrate that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO binds to TRiC directly, mainly through its β-strand rich, DNA-binding domain (AML-(1-175)), with the assistance of HSP70. Our results suggest that TRiC contributes to AML1-ETO proteostasis through specific interactions between the oncoprotein's DNA-binding domain, which may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.((PMID:26674644))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1-Evi-1 is a chimeric gene generated by the t (3; 21) (q26; q22) translocation, which leads into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by unclear mechanisms. This in vivo study aimed to establish a stable line of zebrafish expressing the human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene under the control of a heat stress-inducible bidirectional promoter, and investigate its roles in hematopoiesis and hematologic malignancies.We introduced human RUNX1-Evi-1 fusion gene into embryonic zebrafish through a heat-shock promoter to establish Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. Two males and one female mosaic F0 zebrafish embryos (2.1%) were identified as stable positive germline transgenic zebrafish.The population of immature myeloid cells and hematopoietic blast cells were accumulated in peripheral blood and single cell suspension from kidney of adult Tg(RE:HSE:EGFP) zebrafish. RUNX1-Evi-1 presented an intensive influence on hematopoietic regulatory factors. Consequently, primitive hematopoiesis was enhanced by upregulation of gata2 and scl, while erythropoiesis was downregulated due to the suppression of gata1. Early stage of myelopoiesis was flourishing with the high expression of pu.1, but it was inhibited along with the low expression of mpo. Microarray analysis demonstrated that RUNX1-Evi-1 not only upregulated proteasome, cell cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tyrosine metabolism, drug metabolism, and PPAR pathway, but also suppressed transforming growth factor β, Jak-STAT, DNA replication, mismatch repair, p53 pathway, JNK signaling pathway, and nucleotide excision repair. Interestingly, histone deacetylase 4 was significantly up-regulated. Factors in cell proliferation were obviously suppressed after 3-day treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid. Accordingly, higher proportion of G1 arrest and apoptosis were manifested by the propidium iodide staining.RUNX1-Evi-1 may promote proliferation and apoptosis resistance of primitive hematopoietic cell, and inhibit the differentiation of myeloid cells with the synergy of different pathways and factors. VPA may be a promising choice in the molecular targeting therapy of RUNX1-Evi-1-related leukemia.((PMID:26580584))Two distantly located promoter regions regulate the dynamic expression of RUNX genes during development: distal P1 and proximal P2 promoters. We have recently described that β-catenin increases total Runx1 mRNA levels in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors and enhances spatial proximity with its translocation partner ETO. Here, we report that induction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HL60 and Jurkat leukemia-derived cell lines and CD34(+) progenitors selectively activate the production of the longer distal P1-Runx1 mRNA isoform. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that the differential increase in P1-Runx1 expression is accomplished through a minimal β-catenin responsive region that includes a highly conserved TCF/LEF-binding element, located -20/-16 bp upstream of the canonical distal P1-Runx1 transcription start site. We conclude that the distal P1-Runx1 promoter is a direct transcriptional target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that may be important in normal hematopoiesis or its transition into malignant stem cells during the onset or progression of leukemia.((PMID:26418744))The generation of diverse neuronal subtypes involves specification of neural progenitors and, subsequently, postmitotic neuronal differentiation, a relatively poorly understood process. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of Cbfb but not Runx1 prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of Runx1 in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for Cbfb expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification.((PMID:26397705))The t(8;21) and Inv(16) translocations disrupt the normal function of core binding factors alpha (CBFA) and beta (CBFB), respectively. These translocations represent two of the most common genomic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, occurring in approximately 25% pediatric and 15% of adult with this malignancy. Both translocations are associated with favorable clinical outcomes after intensive chemotherapy, and given the perceived mechanistic similarities, patients with these translocations are frequently referred to as having CBF-AML. It remains uncertain as to whether, collectively, these translocations are mechanistically the same or impact different pathways in subtle ways that have both biological and clinical significance. Therefore, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the similarities and differences in genes and pathways between these subtypes of pediatric AMLs. Diagnostic RNA from patients with t(8;21) (N = 17), Inv(16) (N = 14), and normal karyotype (NK, N = 33) were subjected to RNA-seq. Analyses compared the transcriptomes across these three cytogenetic subtypes, using the NK cohort as the control. A total of 1291 genes in t(8;21) and 474 genes in Inv(16) were differentially expressed relative to the NK controls, with 198 genes differentially expressed in both subtypes. The majority of these genes (175/198; binomial test p-value < 10(-30)) are consistent in expression changes among the two subtypes suggesting the expression profiles are more similar between the CBF cohorts than in the NK cohort. Our analysis also revealed alternative splicing events (ASEs) differentially expressed across subtypes, with 337 t(8;21)-specific and 407 Inv(16)-specific ASEs detected, the majority of which were acetylated proteins (p = 1.5 x 10(-51) and p = 1.8 x 10(-54) for the two subsets). In addition to known fusions, we identified and verified 16 de novo fusions in 43 patients, including three fusions involving NUP98 in six patients. Clustering of differentially expressed genes indicated that the homeobox (HOX) gene family, including two transcription factors (MEIS1 and NKX2-3) were down-regulated in CBF compared to NK samples. This finding supports existing data that the dysregulation of HOX genes play a central role in biology CBF-AML hematopoiesis. These data provide comprehensive transcriptome profiling of CBF-AML and delineate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed, providing insights into the shared biology as well as differences in the two CBF subsets.((PMID:26333776))Chromosomal translocations are frequently associated with a wide variety of cancers, particularly hematologic malignancies. A recurrent chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia is the reciprocal translocation t(8;21) that fuses RUNX1 and ETO genes. We report here that Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases the expression of ETO and RUNX1 genes in human hematopoietic progenitors. We found that β-catenin is rapidly recruited into RNA polymerase II transcription factories (RNAPII-Ser5) and that ETO and RUNX1 genes are brought into close spatial proximity upon Wnt3a induction. Notably, long-term treatment of cells with Wnt3a induces the generation a frequent RUNX1-ETO translocation event. Thus, Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces transcription and translocation of RUNX1 and ETO fusion gene partners, opening a novel window to understand the onset/development of leukemia.((PMID:26254341))Th-inducing Pox virus and zinc finger/Krüppel-like factor (ThPOK) is a key commitment factor for CD4(+) lineage T cells and is essential for the maintenance of CD4 lineage integrity; thus, the expression of ThPOK has to be tightly controlled. In this article, we demonstrate that Myc-associated zinc finger-related factor (MAZR) and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) together repressed ThPOK in preselection double-positive thymocytes, whereas MAZR acted in synergy with Runx3 in the repression of ThPOK in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, MAZR-Runx1 and MAZR-Runx3 double-mutant mice showed enhanced derepression of Cd4 in double-negative thymocytes and in CD8(+) T cells in comparison with Runx1 or Runx3 single-deficient mice, respectively, indicating that MAZR modulates Cd4 silencing. Thus, our data demonstrate developmental stage-specific synergistic activities between MAZR and Runx/core-binding factor β (CBFβ) complexes. Finally, retroviral Cre-mediated conditional deletion of MAZR in peripheral CD8(+) T cells led to the derepression of ThPOK, thus showing that MAZR is also part of the molecular machinery that maintains a repressed state of ThPOK in CD8(+) T cells.((PMID:26091714))Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in tumor-associated immunosuppression, thus affecting effective immunotherapies for cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the differentiation and function of MDSCs remain largely unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of microRNA (miR)-9 promoted the differentiation of MDSCs with significantly reduced immunosuppressive function whereas overexpression of miR-9 markedly enhanced the function of MDSCs. Notably, knockdown of miR-9 significantly impaired the activity of MDSCs and inhibited the tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice. Moreover, miR-9 regulated MDSCs differentiation by targeting the runt-related transcription factor 1, an essential transcription factor in regulating MDSC differentiation and function. Furthermore, the CREB was found to regulate miR-9 expression in MDSCs. Taken together, our findings have identified a critical role of miR-9 in regulating the differentiation and function of MDSCs.((PMID:26019273))Proper regulation of microbial-induced cytokines is critical to intestinal immune homeostasis. Acute stimulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), the Crohn's disease-associated sensor of bacterial peptidoglycan, induces cytokines. However, chronic NOD2 stimulation in macrophages decreases cytokines upon pattern recognition receptor (PRR) restimulation; cytokine attenuation to PRR stimulation is similarly observed in intestinal macrophages. The role for the transcriptional repressors Twist1 and Twist2 in regulating PRR-induced cytokine outcomes is poorly understood and has not been reported for NOD2. We found that Twist1 and Twist2 were required for optimal cytokine downregulation during acute and, particularly, chronic NOD2 stimulation of human macrophages. Consistently, Twist1 and Twist2 expression was increased after chronic NOD2 stimulation; this increased expression was IL-10 and TGF-β dependent. Although Twist1 and Twist2 did not coregulate each other's expression, they cooperated to enhance binding to cytokine promoters after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Moreover, Twist1 and Twist2 contributed to enhance expression and promoter binding of the proinflammatory inhibitor c-Maf and the transcriptional repressor Bmi1. Restoring c-Maf and Bmi1 expression in Twist-deficient macrophages restored NOD2-induced cytokine downregulation. Furthermore, with chronic NOD2 stimulation, Twist1 and Twist2 contributed to the decreased expression and cytokine promoter binding of the transcriptional activators activating transcription factor 4, C/EBPα, Runx1, and Runx2. Knockdown of these transcriptional activators in Twist-deficient macrophages restored cytokine downregulation after chronic NOD2 stimulation. Finally, NOD2 synergized with additional PRRs to increase Twist1 and Twist2 expression and Twist-dependent pathways. Therefore, after chronic NOD2 stimulation Twist1 and Twist2 coordinate the regulation of both transcriptional activators and repressors, thereby mediating optimal cytokine downregulation.((PMID:26001080))Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is a group of secondary and organized lymphoid tissue that develops at different mucosal surfaces. Peyer's patches (PPs), nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), and tear duct-associated lymphoid tissue (TALT) are representative MALT in the small intestine, nasal cavity, and lacrimal sac, respectively. A recent study has shown that transcriptional regulators of core binding factor (Cbf) β2 and promotor-1-transcribed Runt-related transcription factor 1 (P1-Runx1) are required for the differentiation of CD3-CD4+CD45+ lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, which initiate and trigger the developmental program of PPs, but the involvement of this pathway in NALT and TALT development remains to be elucidated. Here we report that Cbfβ2 plays an essential role in NALT and TALT development by regulating LTi cell trafficking to the NALT and TALT anlagens. Cbfβ2 was expressed in LTi cells in all three types of MALT examined. Indeed, similar to the previous finding for PPs, we found that Cbfβ2-/- mice lacked NALT and TALT lymphoid structures. However, in contrast to PPs, NALT and TALT developed normally in the absence of P1-Runx1 or other Runx family members such as Runx2 and Runx3. LTi cells for NALT and TALT differentiated normally but did not accumulate in the respective lymphoid tissue anlagens in Cbfβ2-/- mice. These findings demonstrate that Cbfβ2 is a central regulator of the MALT developmental program, but the dependency of Runx proteins on the lymphoid tissue development would differ among PPs, NALT, and TALT.((PMID:25994056))Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation can be used to identify transcriptional enhancers, but no systematic approach has been developed for genome-wide identification and analysis of enhancers based on DNA methylation. We describe ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships), an R-based tool that uses DNA methylation to identify enhancers and correlates enhancer state with expression of nearby genes to identify transcriptional targets. Transcription factor motif analysis of enhancers is coupled with expression analysis of transcription factors to infer upstream regulators. Using ELMER, we investigated more than 2,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identified networks regulated by known cancer drivers such as GATA3 and FOXA1 (breast cancer), SOX17 and FOXA2 (endometrial cancer), and NFE2L2, SOX2, and TP63 (squamous cell lung cancer). We also identified novel networks with prognostic associations, including RUNX1 in kidney cancer. We propose ELMER as a powerful new paradigm for understanding the cis-regulatory interface between cancer-associated transcription factors and their functional target genes.((PMID:25893288))The t(12;21) translocation is the most common genetic rearrangement in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and gives rise to the TEL-AML1 fusion gene. Many studies on TEL-AML1 describe specific properties of the fusion protein, but a thorough understanding of its function is lacking. We exploited a pluripotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell line, EML1, and generated a cell line (EML-TA) stably expressing the TEL-AML1 fusion protein. EML1 cells differentiate to mature B-cells following treatment with IL7; whereas EML-TA display an impaired differentiation capacity and remain blocked at an early stage of maturation. Global gene expression profiling of EML1 cells at different stages of B-lymphoid differentiation, compared with EML-TA, identified the interferon (IFN)α/β pathway as a primary target of repression by TEL-AML1. In particular, expression and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was decreased in EML-TA cells; strikingly, stable expression of IRF3 restored the capacity of EML-TA cells to differentiate into mature B-cells. Similarly, IRF3 silencing in EML1 cells by siRNA was sufficient to block B-lymphoid differentiation. The ability of TEL-AML1 to block B-cell differentiation and downregulate the IRF3-IFNα/β pathway was confirmed in mouse and human primary hematopoietic precursor cells (Lin- and CD34+ cells, respectively), and in a patient-derived cell line expressing TEL-AML1 (REH). Furthermore, treatment of TEL-AML1 expressing cells with IFNα/β was sufficient to overcome the maturation block. Our data provide new insight on TEL-AML1 function and may offer a new therapeutic opportunity for B-ALL.((PMID:25840971))Transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for normal hematopoiesis. High mutation frequencies of RUNX1 gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been described, whereas the biologic significances of the mutations were not investigated. Here, we aimed to correlate the biologic activities of the RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes of patients.We examined the mutational status of RUNX1 in 143 MDS and 84 CMML patients. Then, we studied the DNA and CBFβ binding abilities of all the RUNX1 mutants identified by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, and also determined their activities on target C-FMS gene induction by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Using luciferase reporter assay, the relative biologic activities of each RUNX1 mutant could be quantified and correlated with the patient outcomes by statistical analyses.We observed that most RUNX1 mutants had reduced abilities in DNA binding, CBFβ heterodimerization, and C-FMS gene induction. The relative biologic activities of RUNX1 mutants were grouped into high- and low-activity mutations. Correlation of the activities of RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes revealed that patients harboring lower activities of RUNX1 mutants had a higher risk and shorter time to secondary acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS and CMML. In multivariate analysis, low RUNX1 activity remained an independent predictor for secondary acute myeloid leukemia-free survival in MDS patients.The biologic activity rather than the mutational status of RUNX1 might be an indicator in predicting outcome of patients with MDS and CMML.((PMID:25742748))CBFβ-SMMHC (core-binding factor β-smooth muscle myosin heavy chain), the fusion protein generated by the chromosome 16 inversion fusion gene, CBFB-MYH11, is known to initiate leukemogenesis. However, the mechanism through which CBFβ-SMMHC contributes to leukemia development is not well understood. Previously, it was proposed that CBFβ-SMMHC acts by dominantly repressing the transcription factor RUNX1 (Runt-related protein 1), but we recently showed that CBFβ-SMMHC has activities that are independent of RUNX1 repression. In addition, we showed that a modified CBFβ-SMMHC with decreased RUNX1-binding activity accelerates leukemogenesis. These results raise questions about the importance of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis by CBFβ-SMMHC. To test this, we generated mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 in a Runx1-deficient background, resulting from either homozygous Runx1-null alleles (Runx1(-/-)) or a single dominant-negative Runx1 allele (Runx1(+/lz)). We found that loss of Runx1 activity rescued the differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11 during primitive hematopoiesis. During definitive hematopoiesis, RUNX1 loss also significantly reduced the proliferation and differentiation defects induced by Cbfb-MYH11. Importantly, Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemia had much longer latency in Runx1(+/lz) mice than in Runx1-sufficient mice. These data indicate that Runx1 activity is critical for Cbfb-MYH11-induced hematopoietic defects and leukemogenesis.((PMID:25678665))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of adult leukemia. The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16)(p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML. Current inv(16) AML treatment with nonselective cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a good initial response but limited long-term survival. Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFβ-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1. AI-10-49 restores RUNX1 transcriptional activity, displays favorable pharmacokinetics, and delays leukemia progression in mice. Treatment of primary inv(16) AML patient blasts with AI-10-49 triggers selective cell death. These data suggest that direct inhibition of the oncogenic CBFβ-SMMHC fusion protein may be an effective therapeutic approach for inv(16) AML, and they provide support for transcription factor targeted therapy in other cancers.((PMID:25605286))Differentiated CD4(+) T cells preserve plasticity under various conditions. However, the stability of Th1 cells is unclear, as is whether Th1 cells can convert into Th17 cells and thereby contribute to the generation of IFN-γ(+) IL-17(+) CD4(+) T cells, the number of which correlates with severity of colitis. We investigated whether IFN-γ(+) Th1 cells can convert into Th17 cells under intestinal inflammation and the mechanisms involved. IFN-γ(Thy1.1+) Th1 cells were generated by culturing naïve CD4(+) T cells from IFN-γ(Thy1.1) CBir1 TCR-Tg reporter mice, whose TCR is specific for an immunodominant microbiota antigen, CBir1 flagellin, under Th1 polarizing conditions. IFN-γ(Thy1.1+) Th1 cells induced colitis in Rag(-/-) mice after adoptive transfer and converted into IL-17(+) Th17, but not Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the inflamed intestines. TGF-β and IL-6, but not IL-1β and IL-23, regulated Th1 conversion into Th17 cells. TGF-β induction of transcriptional factor Runx1 is crucial for the conversion, since silencing Runx1 by siRNA inhibited Th1 conversion into Th17 cells. Furthermore, TGF-β enhanced histone H3K9 acetylation but inhibited H3K9 trimethylation of Runx1- and ROR-γt-binding sites on il-17 or rorc gene in Th1 cells. We conclude that Th1 cells convert into Th17 cells under inflammatory conditions in intestines, which is possibly mediated by TGF-β induction of Runx1.((PMID:25083921))Cooperative assemblies of transcription factors (TFs) on target gene enhancers coordinate cell proliferation, fate specification, and differentiation through precise and complicated transcriptional mechanisms. Chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, of TFs induced by cell signaling further modulate the dynamic cooperativity of TFs. In this study, we found that various Ets1-containing TF-DNA complexes respond differently to calcium-induced phosphorylation of Ets1, which is known to inhibit Ets1-DNA binding. Crystallographic analysis of a complex comprising Ets1, Runx1, and CBFβ at the TCRα enhancer revealed that Ets1 acquires robust binding stability in the Runx1 and DNA-complexed state, via allosteric mechanisms. This allows phosphorylated Ets1 to be retained at the TCRα enhancer with Runx1, in contrast to other Ets1 target gene enhancers including mb-1 and stromelysin-1. This study provides a structure-based model for cell-signaling-dependent regulation of target genes, mediated via chemical modification of TFs.((PMID:25025858))The aim of this research was to investigate the gene expression profile of 4 transcription factors in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) cultured with a xenogeneic bone substitute and a support of machined titanium.In vitro studies were performed on hMSC cells, which grew in contact with cortical porcine bone and machined titanium disks for 10 days. RNA quantification for genes DLX5, CTNNB1, RUNX1, and SP7 was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. For cells supported by titanium, immunocytochemistry of osteocalcin (OC) was also performed.In the osteoblast-induced cells (OIC), DLX5, CTNNB1, and RUNX1 were significantly upregulated (+2.38-, +3.51-, and +7.08-fold, respectively), whereas SP7 was downregulated (-26.32-fold). None of the genes seemed to be upregulated or downregulated by the corticocancellous porcine bone. In cells grown on titanium support, DLX5 and RUNX1 were respectively upregulated (+3.12-fold) and downregulated (-2.14-fold). For titanium support, the presence of both catenin beta-1 and OC was verified.The 2 genes RUNX1 and SP7 resulted differently expressed in cells cultured on metallic supports if compared with the expression recorded for OIC. An induction of the osteogenic phenotype was observed when cells were cultured on machined titanium, but not on xenogeneic material.((PMID:24798493))Core-binding factor β (Cbfβ) is a subunit of the Cbf family of heterodimeric transcription factors, which plays a critical role in skeletal development through its interaction with the Cbfα subunits, also known as Runt-related transcription factors (Runxs). However, the mechanism by which Cbfβ regulates cartilage and bone development remains unclear. Existing Cbfβ-deficient mouse models cannot specify the role of Cbfβ in skeletal cell lineage. Herein, we sought to specifically address the role of Cbfβ in cartilage and bone development by using a conditional knockout (CKO) approach. A mesenchymal-specific Cbfβ CKO mouse model was generated by using the Dermo1-Cre mouse line to specifically delete Cbfβ in mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Surprisingly, the mutant mice had under-developed larynx and tracheal cartilage, causing alveolus defects that led to death shortly after birth from suffocation. Also, the mutant mice exhibited severe skeletal deformities from defective intramembranous and endochondral ossification, owing to delayed chondrocyte maturation and impaired osteoblast differentiation. Almost all bones of the mutant mice, including the calvariae, vertebrae, tibiae, femurs, ribs, limbs and sternums were defective. Importantly, we showed that Cbfβ was expressed throughout the skeleton during both embryonic and postnatal development, which explains the multiple-skeletal defects observed in the mutant mice. Consistently, Cbfβ deficiency impaired both chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy zone hypertrophy during growth-plate development in the long bones of mutant mice. Notably, Cbfβ, Runx1 and Runx2 displayed different expression patterns in the growth plates of the wild-type mice, indicating that Cbfβ/Runx1 complex and Cbfβ/Runx2 complex may regulate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, respectively, in a spatial and temporal manner. Cbfβ deletion in the mesenchymal progenitors affected bone development by dramatically down-regulating Collagen X (Col X) and Osterix (Osx) but had a dispensable effect on osteoclast development. Collectively, the results demonstrate that Cbfβ mediates cartilage and bone development by interacting with Runx1 and Runx2 to regulate the expressions of Col X and Osx for chondrocyte and osteoblast development. These findings not only reveal a critical role for Cbfβ in cartilage and bone development but also facilitate the design of novel therapeutic approaches for skeletal diseases.((PMID:27176614))Core binding factor (CBF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor complex composed of a DNA-binding subunit, one of three runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) factors, and a non-DNA binding subunit, CBFβ. CBFβ is critical for DNA binding and stability of the CBF transcription factor complex. In the ovary, the LH surge increases the expression of Runx1 and Runx2 in periovulatory follicles, implicating a role for CBFs in the periovulatory process. The present study investigated the functional significance of CBFs (RUNX1/CBFβ and RUNX2/CBFβ) in the ovary by examining the ovarian phenotype of granulosa cell-specific CBFβ knockdown mice; CBFβ f/f * Cyp19 cre. The mutant female mice exhibited significant reductions in fertility, with smaller litter sizes, decreased progesterone during gestation, and fewer cumulus oocyte complexes collected after an induced superovulation. RNA sequencing and transcriptome assembly revealed altered expression of more than 200 mRNA transcripts in the granulosa cells of Cbfb knockdown mice after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation in vitro. Among the affected transcripts are known regulators of ovulation and luteinization including Sfrp4, Sgk1, Lhcgr, Prlr, Wnt4, and Edn2 as well as many genes not yet characterized in the ovary. Cbfβ knockdown mice also exhibited decreased expression of key genes within the corpora lutea and morphological changes in the ovarian structure, including the presence of large antral follicles well into the luteal phase. Overall, these data suggest a role for CBFs as significant regulators of gene expression, ovulatory processes, and luteal development in the ovary.((PMID:26058470))Core binding factor β (Cbfβ) is a partner protein of Runx family transcription factors with minimally characterized function in cartilage. Here we address the role of Cbfβ in cartilage by generating chondrocyte-specific Cbfβ-deficient mice (Cbfb(Δch/Δch) ) from Cbfb-floxed mice crossed with mice expressing Cre from the Col2a1 promoter. Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice died soon after birth and exhibited delayed endochondral bone formation, shorter appendicular skeleton length with increased proliferative chondrocytes, and nearly absent hypertrophic chondrocyte zones. Immunohistochemical and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the number and size of proliferative chondrocytes increased and the expression of chondrocyte maturation markers at the growth plates, including Runx2, osterix, and osteopontin, significantly diminished in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice compared to wild type mice. With regard to signaling pathways, both PTHrP-Ihh and BMP signaling were compromised in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice. Mechanistically, Cbfβ deficiency in chondrocytes caused a decrease of protein levels of Runx transcription factors by accelerating polyubiquitination-mediated proteosomal degradation in vitro. Indeed, Runx2 and Runx3, but not Runx1, decreased in Cbfb(Δch/Δch) mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that Cbfβ plays a critical role for chondrocyte differentiation through stabilizing Runx2 and Runx3 proteins in cartilage.((PMID:25262822))Runx family proteins, Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3, play important roles in skeletal development. Runx2 is required for osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation, and haplodeficiency of RUNX2 causes cleidocranial dysplasia, which is characterized by open fontanelles and sutures and hypoplastic clavicles. Cbfb forms a heterodimer with Runx family proteins and enhances their DNA-binding capacity. Cbfb-deficient (Cbfb(-/-) ) mice die at midgestation because of the lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis. We previously reported that the partial rescue of hematopoiesis in Cbfb(-/-) mice revealed the requirement of Cbfb in skeletal development. However, the precise functions of Cbfb in skeletal development still remain to be clarified. We deleted Cbfb in mesenchymal cells giving rise to both chondrocyte and osteoblast lineages by mating Cbfb(fl/fl) mice with Dermo1 Cre knock-in mice. Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) mice showed dwarfism, both intramembranous and endochondral ossifications were retarded, and chondrocyte maturation and proliferation and osteoblast differentiation were inhibited. The differentiation of chondrocytes and osteoblasts were severely inhibited in vitro, and the reporter activities of Ihh, Col10a1, and Bglap2 promoter constructs were reduced in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) chondrocytes or osteoblasts. The proteins of Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3 were reduced in the cartilaginous limb skeletons and calvariae of Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) embryos compared with the respective protein in the respective tissue of Cbfb(fl/fl) embryos at E15.5, although the reduction of Runx2 protein in calvariae was much milder than that in cartilaginous limb skeletons. All of the Runx family proteins were severely reduced in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) primary osteoblasts, and Runx2 protein was less stable in Cbfb(fl/fl/Cre) osteoblasts than Cbfb(fl/fl) osteoblasts. These findings indicate that Cbfb is required for skeletal development by regulating chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation and osteoblast differentiation; that Cbfb plays an important role in the stabilization of Runx family proteins; and that Runx2 protein stability is less dependent on Cbfb in calvariae than in cartilaginous limb skeletons.((PMID:24319172))The genetics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are becoming well understood and the incidence of individual chromosomal abnormalities varies considerably with age. Cytogenetics provide reliable risk stratification for treatment: high hyperdiploidy and ETV6-RUNX1 are good risk, whereas BCR-ABL1, MLL rearrangements, and hypodiploidy are poor risk. Nevertheless, some patients within the good- and intermediate-risk groups will unpredictably relapse. With advancing technologies in array-based approaches (single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) and next-generation sequencing to study the genome, increasing numbers of new genetic changes are being discovered. These include deletions of B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes, as well as mutations of genes in key signaling pathways. Their associations and interactions with established cytogenetic subgroups and with each other are becoming elucidated. Whether they have a link to outcome is the most important factor for refinement of risk factors in relation to clinical trials. For several newly identified abnormalities, including intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21), that are associated with a poor prognosis with standard therapy, appropriately modified treatment has significantly improved outcome. After the successful use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients with alternative ABL1 translocations and rearrangements involving PDGFRB may benefit from treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Other aberrations, for example, CRLF2 overexpression and JAK2 mutations, are also providing potential novel therapeutic targets with the prospect of reduced toxicity.((PMID:23979164))RUNX1 is generally considered a tumor suppressor in myeloid neoplasms. Inactivating RUNX1 mutations have frequently been found in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, no somatic RUNX1 alteration was found in AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia and MLL fusion leukemia, raising the possibility that RUNX1 could actually promote the growth of these leukemia cells. Using normal human cord blood cells and those expressing leukemogenic fusion proteins, we discovered a dual role of RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. RUNX1 overexpression inhibited the growth of normal cord blood cells by inducing myeloid differentiation, whereas a certain level of RUNX1 activity was required for the growth of AML1-ETO and MLL-AF9 cells. Using a mouse genetic model, we also showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited leukemia development induced by MLL-AF9. RUNX2 could compensate for the loss of RUNX1. The survival effect of RUNX1 was mediated by BCL2 in MLL fusion leukemia. Our study unveiled an unexpected prosurvival role for RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. Inhibiting RUNX1 activity rather than enhancing it could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins.((PMID:23772668))The 8;21 translocation is the most common chromosomal aberration occurring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This translocation causes expression of the RUNX1-ETO (AML1-ETO) fusion protein, which cooperates with additional mutations in leukemia development. We report here that interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes are a group of genes consistently up-regulated by RUNX1-ETO in both human and murine models. RUNX1-ETO-induced up-regulation of IFN-stimulated genes occurs primarily via type I IFN signaling with a requirement for the IFNAR complex. Addition of exogenous IFN in vitro significantly reduces the increase in self-renewal potential induced by both RUNX1-ETO and its leukemogenic splicing isoform RUNX1-ETO9a. Finally, loss of type I IFN signaling via knockout of Ifnar1 significantly accelerates leukemogenesis in a t(8;21) murine model. This demonstrates the role of increased IFN signaling as an important factor inhibiting t(8;21) fusion protein function and leukemia development and supports the use of type I IFNs in the treatment of AML.((PMID:23713453))Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) is a downstream effector of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and its dysregulation is associated with a number of malignant diseases such as leukemia. We explored the expression profile of LEF1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determined its specific prognostic significance in this disease. The LEF1 mRNA level in patients with previously untreated AML was significantly higher than in normal controls. Patients with AML with relatively higher LEF1 expression were more likely to achieve a complete remission (CR) following induction therapy in comparison to those with a lower LEF1 level. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that primary AML samples with AML1-ETO or PML-RARα have a higher LEF1 level compared with those without each fusion gene. High LEF1 expression predicts a significantly better overall survival for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. High LEF1 level was associated with a favorable relapse-free survival in patients with FLT3-ITD wild-type. Finally, a scoring system based on LEF1 level and mutation status of FLT3-ITD or NPM1 is reliable to predict the outcome for AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Our results indicate that LEF1 contributes to the pathophysiology of AML and could serve as a novel predictor of better treatment response. LEF1 level may be incorporated into an improved risk classification system for certain specific subtypes of AML.((PMID:23672350))No consecutive analysis of BAALC and WT1 expressions associated with core-binding factor AML (CBF-AML) from diagnosis to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has yet been reported. We investigated BAALC and WT1 expressions using a method of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) at diagnosis, after induction chemotherapy, at pre-HSCT, and at post-HSCT period in 45 consecutive patients [t(8,21) (n = 28), inv(16) (n = 17)], who received HSCT as a post-remission treatment. BAALC and WT1 RQ-PCR decrement ratio (DR) was also calculated at post-induction chemotherapy, at pre-HSCT, and at post-HSCT compared with the diagnostic level. Higher BAALC expression at diagnosis showed significantly inferior OS (P = 0.031), EFS (P = 0.011), and higher CIR (P = 0.002) rates. At post-HSCT, both higher BAALC and WT1 expressions showed significantly inferior OS (P = 0.005, 0.016), EFS (P = 0.002, 0.006), and higher CIR (P = 0.001, 0.003) rates. A subgroup of t(8;21) showing higher BAALC and WT1 expressions at post-HSCT were also associated with inferior OS (P = 0.018, 0.015) and higher CIR rates (P = 0.019, 0.011). While BAALC DR showed no significant results on outcomes, WT1 DR more than 2-log at post-HSCT showed significantly lower CIR rate (P = 0.028). This study showed that higher post-HSCT BAALC and WT1 expressions in patients with CBF-AML may be good markers of minimal residual disease for the prediction of survival and relapse after HSCT.((PMID:23645839))Developing novel therapies that suppress self-renewal of leukemia stem cells may reduce the likelihood of relapses and extend long-term survival of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML1-ETO (AE) is an oncogene that plays an important role in inducing self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), leading to the development of leukemia stem cells. Previously, using a zebrafish model of AE and a whole-organism chemical suppressor screen, we have discovered that AE induces specific hematopoietic phenotypes in embryonic zebrafish through a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and β-catenin-dependent pathway. Here, we show that AE also induces expression of the Cox-2 gene and activates β-catenin in mouse bone marrow cells. Inhibition of COX suppresses β-catenin activation and serial replating of AE(+) mouse HSPCs. Genetic knockdown of β-catenin also abrogates the clonogenic growth of AE(+) mouse HSPCs and human leukemia cells. In addition, treatment with nimesulide, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, dramatically suppresses xenograft tumor formation and inhibits in vivo progression of human leukemia cells. In summary, our data indicate an important role of a COX/β-catenin-dependent signaling pathway in tumor initiation, growth, and self-renewal, and in providing the rationale for testing potential benefits from common COX inhibitors as a part of AML treatments.((PMID:23179400))It is known that leukemia patients with extramedullary infiltration (EMI) have a worse prognosis than patients without it. Recent data indicate that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in cell adhesion, motility, and proliferation. The expression of APP and its prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been studied. Our study shows that AML/ETO(+) leukemia patients that overexpress APP easily get EMI and that their long-term survival rate is lower than patients without overexpression of APP. In an in vitro study, we knocked down APP in Kasumi-1 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Transwell data show that siRNA/APP substantially impairs cell migration, but it does not inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, we found that siRNA/APP decreases MMP-2 expression in vitro. Our study provides a novel clue that APP is involved in the extramedullary infiltration of leukemia by MMP-2.((PMID:22031861))Secreted-frizzled related proteins (SFRPs) are modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway that is closely involved in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Epigenetic deregulation of Wnt modulators leading to aberrant signaling has been reported in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its occurrence in childhood patients with AML and the role of individual modulators are unclear. In this study, we examined SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4, and SFRP5 promoter methylation in 83 patients with AML (59 children and 24 adults) and found preferential SFRP1 methylation and mRNA down-regulation in the prognostically favorable subgroup of AML with t(8;21) translocation. Among the 4 genes, SFRP1 methylation independently predicted prolonged event-free and relapse-free survivals in childhood patients with nonacute promyelocytic leukemia with nonadverse cytogenetics. Mechanistically, we further demonstrated that RUNX1-ETO, the t(8;21) fusion product, specifically bound the SFRP1 promoter and repressed its transcription via a consensus RUNX binding site. In t(8;21)-leukemia cells, SFRP1 selectively inhibited canonical Wnt signaling and cellular proliferation that were associated with concomitant down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, including CCND1 and MYC. Taken together, we identified SFRP1 as a transcriptional repression target of the t(8;21) fusion protein and demonstrated a novel mechanism of Wnt activation in a specific subtype of AML.((PMID:22012064))The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) H3K4 methyltransferase protein, and the heterodimeric RUNX1/CBFβ transcription factor complex, are critical for definitive and adult hematopoiesis, and both are frequently targeted in human acute leukemia. We identified a physical and functional interaction between RUNX1 (AML1) and MLL and show that both are required to maintain the histone lysine 4 trimethyl mark (H3K4me3) at 2 critical regulatory regions of the AML1 target gene PU.1. Similar to CBFβ, we show that MLL binds to AML1 abrogating its proteasome-dependent degradation. Furthermore, a subset of previously uncharacterized frame-shift and missense mutations at the N terminus of AML1, found in MDS and AML patients, impairs its interaction with MLL, resulting in loss of the H3K4me3 mark within PU.1 regulatory regions, and decreased PU.1 expression. The interaction between MLL and AML1 provides a mechanism for the sequence-specific binding of MLL to DNA, and identifies RUNX1 target genes as potential effectors of MLL function.((PMID:21051318))The genetic origins of the development of malignant haematological disorders have been established at the beginning of the 80ies. Systematic characterization of chromosomal structural abnormalities and, more recently by DNA microarray approaches and sequencing of tumour genomes have allowed the identification of a large number of genes that are mutated during malignant transformation in humans. Functional studies of these human oncogenes have shown that most of them were not able to transform a haematologic progenitor when acting alone and that cooperation with other oncogenic events was required. The present challenges are the evaluation of the role of each mutation in malignant transformation and the definition of the chronology of their emergence. From these data, the development of efficient therapeutic approaches will be possible by targeting the early oncogenic events which are at the origin of the malignant transformation.((PMID:20688956))Among mutations in human Runx1/AML1 transcription factors, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) genomic translocation that creates an AML1-ETO fusion protein is implicated in etiology of the acute myeloid leukemia. To identify genes and components associated with this oncogene we used Drosophila as a genetic model. Expression of AML1-ETO caused an expansion of hematopoietic precursors in Drosophila, which expressed high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mutations in functional domains of the fusion protein suppress the proliferative phenotype. In a genetic screen, we found that inactivation of EcRB1 or activation of Foxo and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) suppress the AML1-ETO-induced phenotype by reducing ROS expression in the precursor cells. Our studies indicate that ROS is a signaling factor promoting maintenance of normal as well as the aberrant myeloid precursors and suggests the importance of antioxidant enzymes and their regulators as targets for further study in the context of leukemia.((PMID:20395424))((PMID:20339092))The transcription factor NF-E2 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Concomitantly, 95% of these patients carry the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Although NF-E2 levels correlate with JAK2(V671F) allele burden in some PV cohorts, the molecular mechanism causing aberrant NF-E2 expression has not been described. Here we show that NF-E2 expression is also increased in patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis independent of the presence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Characterization of the NF-E2 promoter revealed multiple functional binding sites for AML1/RUNX-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter in vivo. Moreover, AML1 binding to the NF-E2 promoter was significantly increased in granulocytes from PV patients compared with healthy controls. AML1 mRNA expression was elevated in patients with PV, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis both in the presence and absence of JAK2(V617F). In addition, AML1 and NF-E2 expression were highly correlated. RNAi-mediated suppression of either AML1 or of its binding partner CBF-beta significantly decreased NF-E2 expression. Moreover, expression of the leukemic fusion protein AML/ETO drastically decreased NF-E2 protein levels. Our data identify NF-E2 as a novel AML1 target gene and delineate a role for aberrant AML1 expression in mediating elevated NF-E2 expression in MPN patients.((PMID:20008176))All cancers evolve by a process of genetic diversification and "natural selection" akin to the process first described by Charles Darwin for species evolution. The evolutionary, natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is almost entirely covert, clinically silent and well advanced by the point of diagnosis. It has, however, been possible to backtrack this process by molecular scrutiny of appropriate clinical samples: (i) leukemic clones in monozygotic twins that are either concordant or discordant for ALL; (ii) archived neonatal blood spots or Guthrie cards from individuals who later developed leukemia; and (iii) stored, viable cord blood cells. These studies indicate prenatal initiation of leukemia by chromosome translocation and gene fusion (or hyperdiploidy) and the post-natal acquisition of multiple, gene copy number alterations (CNAs), mostly deletions. The prenatal or first "hit" occurs very commonly, exceeding the clinical rate of ALL by some 100x and indicating a low rate of penetrance or evolutionary progression. The acquisition of the critical, secondary CNAs requires some Darwinian selective advantage to expand numbers of cells at risk, and the cytokine TGF beta is able to exercise this function. The clonal architecture of ALL has been investigated by single cell analysis with multicolor probes to mutant genes. The data reveal not a linear sequence of mutation acquisition with clonal succession but rather considerable complexity with a tree-like or branching structure of genetically distinct subclones very reminiscent of Darwin's original 1837 evolutionary divergence diagram. This evolutionary pattern has important implications for stem cells in ALL, for the origins of relapse and for therapeutic targeting.((PMID:19901261))Early relapse detection in acute myeloid leukemia is possible using standardized real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) protocols. However, optimal sampling intervals have not been defined and are likely to vary according to the underlying molecular lesion. In 74 patients experiencing hematologic relapse and harboring aberrations amenable to RQ-PCR (mutated NPM1 [designated NPM1c], PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11), we observed strikingly different relapse kinetics. The median doubling time of the CBFB-MYH11 leukemic clone was significantly longer (36 days) than that of clones harboring other markers (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 14 days; PML-RARA, 12 days; and NPM1c, 11 days; P < .001). Furthermore, we used a mathematical model to determine frequency of relapse detection and median time from detection of minimal residual disease to hematologic relapse as a function of sampling interval length. For example, to obtain a relapse detection fraction of 90% and a median time of 60 days, blood sampling every sixth month should be performed for CBFB-MYH11 leukemias. By contrast, in NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(-), NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(+), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and PML-RARA leukemias, bone marrow sampling is necessary every sixth, fourth, and fourth and second month, respectively. These data carry important implications for the development of optimal RQ-PCR monitoring schedules suitable for evaluation of minimal residual disease-directed therapies in future clinical trials.((PMID:19893343))Cytogenetic abnormalities are one of the most reliable prognostic factors in acute leukemia. Combination of conventional chromosome analysis (CCA) and FISH provides higher sensitivity in detecting these genetic abnormalities, and it is effective to apply several FISH probes as a profile test. The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of FISH profile analyses in the initial diagnosis of acute leukemia.Two hundred and forty one de novo acute leukemia patients diagnosed from January, 2002 to November, 2007 were included. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia profile test, FISH probes for BCR/ABL, TEL/AML1, MLL gene rearrangement and CDKN2A deletion were used. For acute myeloid leukemia profile test, probes for AML1/ETO, MLL and CBFbeta gene rearrangement were used. The results of CCA and FISH profile tests were collected, and the positive rates were compared.ALL FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic aberrations not detected by chromosome analysis in 48.6% (67/138) of cases, including those with normal karyotypes or no mitotic cells (37%, 51/138). Among these 51 cases, TEL/AML1 abnormalities were detected in 44.3%, followed by the abnormal CDKN2A signal (24.6%) and hyperdiploidy (18.0%). AML FISH profile tests revealed additional genetic abnormalities in 7.8% (8/103) of cases.FISH analysis as a profile test detected additional genetic aberrations in a significant proportion of acute leukemia, and was effective especially in detecting cryptic translocations, submicroscopic deletions and complex karyotypes. Our study supports the need to incorporate FISH profile test at initial work up in acute leukemia.((PMID:19800266))Naturally arising regulatory T (Treg) cells express the transcription factor FoxP3, which critically controls the development and function of Treg cells. FoxP3 interacts with another transcription factor Runx1 (also known as AML1). Here, we showed that Treg cell-specific deficiency of Cbfbeta, a cofactor for all Runx proteins, or that of Runx1, but not Runx3, induced lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and hyperproduction of IgE. Cbfb-deleted Treg cells exhibited impaired suppressive function in vitro and in vivo, with altered gene expression profiles including attenuated expression of FoxP3 and high expression of interleukin-4. The Runx complex bound to more than 3000 gene loci in Treg cells, including the Foxp3 regulatory regions and the Il4 silencer. In addition, knockdown of RUNX1 showed that RUNX1 is required for the optimal regulation of FoxP3 expression in human T cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the Runx1-Cbfbeta heterodimer is indispensable for in vivo Treg cell function, in particular, suppressive activity and optimal expression of FoxP3.((PMID:19779050))((PMID:25612891))Core Binding Factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) with t(8;21) RUNX1-MTG8 or inv(16) CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins often show upregulation of wild type or mutated KIT receptor. However, also non-CBF-AML frequently displays upregulated KIT expression. In the first part of this study we show that KIT expression can be also upregulated by miR-17, a regulator of RUNX1, the gene encoding a CBF subunit. Interestingly, both CBF leukemia fusion proteins and miR-17, which targets RUNX1-3'UTR, negatively affect a common core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism that forces myeloid cells into an undifferentiated, KIT-induced, proliferating state. In the second part of this study we took advantage of the conservation of the core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism in mouse and human, to mechanistically demonstrate in a mouse myeloid cell model that increased KIT-induced proliferation is per se a mechanism sufficient to delay myeloid differentiation.Human (U937) or mouse (32D) myeloid clonal lines were used, respectively, to test: 1) the effect of RUNX1-MTG8 and CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins, or upregulation of miR-17, on KIT-induced proliferation and myeloid differentiation, and 2) the effect of upregulation of KIT-induced proliferation per se on myeloid cell differentiation.In the first part of this study we found that stable miR-17 upregulation affects, like the CBF-AML fusion proteins (RUNX1-MTG8 or CBFB-MYH11), a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism leading to KIT-induced proliferation of differentiation-arrested U937 myeloid cells. In the second part of the study we harnessed the conservation of this core mechanism in human and mouse to demonstrate that the extent of KIT upregulation in 32D mouse myeloid cells with wild type RUNX1 can per se delay G-CSF-induced differentiation. The integrated information gathered from the two myeloid cell models shows that RUNX1 regulates myeloid differentiation not only by direct transcriptional regulation of coding and non-coding myeloid differentiation functions (e.g. miR-223), but also by modulating KIT-induced proliferation via non-coding miRNAs (e.g. miR-221).The novelty of this study is dual. On the one hand, miRNAs (e.g. miR-17) can mimic the effects of CBF-AML fusion proteins by affecting a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism of KIT-induced proliferation of undifferentiated myeloid cells. On the other hand, the extent of KIT-induced proliferation itself can modulate myeloid differentiation of cells with wild type RUNX1 function.((PMID:25480496))((PMID:24850758))CBFβ and RUNX1 form a DNA-binding heterodimer and are both required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) generation in mice. However, the exact role of CBFβ in the production of HSCs remains unclear. Here, we generated and characterized 2 zebrafish cbfb null mutants. The cbfb(-/-) embryos underwent primitive hematopoiesis and developed transient erythromyeloid progenitors, but they lacked definitive hematopoiesis. Unlike runx1 mutants, in which HSCs are not formed, nascent, runx1(+)/c-myb(+) HSCs were formed in cbfb(-/-) embryos. However, the nascent HSCs were not released from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, as evidenced by the accumulation of runx1(+) cells in the AGM that could not enter circulation. Moreover, wild-type embryos treated with an inhibitor of RUNX1-CBFβ interaction, Ro5-3335, phenocopied the hematopoietic defects in cbfb(-/-) mutants, rather than those in runx1(-/-) mutants. Finally, we found that cbfb was downstream of the Notch pathway during HSC development. Our data suggest that runx1 and cbfb are required at 2 different steps during early HSC development. CBFβ is not required for nascent HSC emergence but is required for the release of HSCs from AGM into circulation. Our results also indicate that RUNX1 can drive the emergence of nascent HSCs in the AGM without its heterodimeric partner CBFβ.((PMID:24677539))Runx1 and Cbfβ are critical for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and are implicated in leukemic transformation. Despite the absolute requirements for these factors in the development of hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes, their roles in the development of bone marrow progenitor subsets have not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that Cbfβ is essential for the development of Flt3(+) macrophage-dendritic cell (DC) progenitors in the bone marrow and all DC subsets in the periphery. Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression of Irf8 restors DC differentiation. These results demonstrate that Runx proteins and Cbfβ restrict granulocyte lineage commitment to facilitate multilineage hematopoietic differentiation and thus identify their novel tumor suppressor function in myeloid leukemia.((PMID:24449215))RUNX1/CBFβ (core binding factor [CBF]) is a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations, point mutations, or deletions in acute leukemia. The mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is also frequently involved in chromosomal translocations or partial tandem duplication in acute leukemia. The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. RUNX1/CBFβ recruits MLL to regulate downstream target genes. However, the functional consequence of MLL fusions on RUNX1/CBFβ activity has not been fully understood. In this report, we show that MLL fusion proteins and the N-terminal MLL portion of MLL fusions downregulate RUNX1 and CBFβ protein expression via the MLL CXXC domain and flanking regions. We confirmed this finding in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice and human M4/M5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, with or without MLL translocations, showing that MLL translocations cause a hypomorph phenotype of RUNX1/CBFβ. Overexpression of RUNX1 inhibits the development of AML in Mll-Af9 knock-in mice; conversely, further reducing Runx1/Cbfβ levels accelerates MLL-AF9-mediated AML in bone marrow transplantation assays. These data reveal a newly defined negative regulation of RUNX1/CBFβ by MLL fusion proteins and suggest that targeting RUNX1/CBFβ levels may be a potential therapy for MLLs.((PMID:24402281))The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protein Vif has a central role in the neutralization of host innate defences by hijacking cellular proteasomal degradation pathways to subvert the antiviral activity of host restriction factors; however, the underlying mechanism by which Vif achieves this remains unclear. Here we report a crystal structure of the Vif-CBF-β-CUL5-ELOB-ELOC complex. The structure reveals that Vif, by means of two domains, organizes formation of the pentameric complex by interacting with CBF-β, CUL5 and ELOC. The larger domain (α/β domain) of Vif binds to the same side of CBF-β as RUNX1, indicating that Vif and RUNX1 are exclusive for CBF-β binding. Interactions of the smaller domain (α-domain) of Vif with ELOC and CUL5 are cooperative and mimic those of SOCS2 with the latter two proteins. A unique zinc-finger motif of Vif, which is located between the two Vif domains, makes no contacts with the other proteins but stabilizes the conformation of the α-domain, which may be important for Vif-CUL5 interaction. Together, our data reveal the structural basis for Vif hijacking of the CBF-β and CUL5 E3 ligase complex, laying a foundation for rational design of novel anti-HIV drugs.((PMID:24002588))Different mechanisms for CBFβ-MYH11 function in acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) have been proposed such as tethering of RUNX1 outside the nucleus, interference with transcription factor complex assembly and recruitment of histone deacetylases, all resulting in transcriptional repression of RUNX1 target genes. Here, through genome-wide CBFβ-MYH11-binding site analysis and quantitative interaction proteomics, we found that CBFβ-MYH11 localizes to RUNX1 occupied promoters, where it interacts with TAL1, FLI1 and TBP-associated factors (TAFs) in the context of the hematopoietic transcription factors ERG, GATA2 and PU.1/SPI1 and the coregulators EP300 and HDAC1. Transcriptional analysis revealed that upon fusion protein knockdown, a small subset of the CBFβ-MYH11 target genes show increased expression, confirming a role in transcriptional repression. However, the majority of CBFβ-MYH11 target genes, including genes implicated in hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal such as ID1, LMO1 and JAG1, are actively transcribed and repressed upon fusion protein knockdown. Together these results suggest an essential role for CBFβ-MYH11 in regulating the expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell phenotype.((PMID:23877199))The rare but recurrent RUNX1-USP42 fusion gene is the result of a t(7;21)(p22;q22) chromosomal translocation and has been described in 6 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and one case of refractory anemia with excess of blast. In the present study, we present the molecular genetic analysis and the clinical features of a t(7;21)(p22;q22)-positive AML case. PCR amplified two RUNX1-USP42 cDNA fragments but no reciprocal USP42-RUNX1 fragment indicating that the RUNX1-USP42 is the leukemogenic fusion gene. Sequencing of the two amplified fragments showed that exon 6 or exon 7 of RUNX1 (accession number NM_001754 version 3) was fused to exon 3 of USP42 (accession number NM_032172 version 2). The predicted RUNX1-USP42 fusion protein would contain the Runt homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for heterodimerization with CBFB and for DNA binding, and the catalytic UCH (ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydroxylase) domain of the USP42 protein. The bone marrow cells in the present case also had a 5q deletion, and it was revealed that 5 out of the 8 reported cases (including the present case) with t(7;21)(p22;q22)/RUNX1-USP42 also had cytogenetic abnormalities of 5q. The fact that t(7;21) and 5q- occur together much more often than chance would allow seems to be unquestionable, although the pathogenetic connection between the two aberrations remains unknown.((PMID:23646898))Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and genetic rearrangements involving the core binding factor (CBF) have favorable prognosis. In contrast, a minority of them still have a high risk of leukemia recurrence. This study investigated the adverse features of CBF AML that could justify investigational therapeutic approaches.One hundred and fifty patients (median age 42 yr, range 16-69) with CBF AML (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 n = 74; CBFB-MYH11 n = 76) were prospectively enrolled into two consecutive CETLAM protocols at 19 Spanish institutions. Main clinic and biologic parameters were analyzed in the whole series. In non-selected cases with available DNA samples, the impact of molecular characterization and minimal residual disease (MRD) was also studied.Overall, complete remission (CR) rate was 89% (94% in ≤50 yr old and 72% in >50 yr, P = 0.002). At 5 yr, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 26 ± 1%, disease-free survival (DFS) 62 ± 6%, and overall survival (OS) 66 ± 4%. In multivariate analyses, leukocyte count above 20 × 10(9) /L, BAALC over-expression, and high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy (CT) led to increased relapse rate. Regarding OS, age >50 yr, leukocyte count above 20 × 10(9) /L, and increased MN1 expression were adverse features.Age, leukocyte counts, BAALC, and MN1 gene expressions as well as high copy numbers of RUNX1-RUNXT1 or CBFB-MYH11 after induction chemotherapy are useful tools to predict the outcome and should be considered for risk-adapted therapy.((PMID:23053179))Core binding factor (CBF)-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents a favorable prognosis, except for patients with KIT mutation, especially D816 mutation. The current retrospective study attempted to validate a prognostic role of KIT mutation in 121 Korean patients with CBF AML. The study patients consisted of 121 patients with CBF AML (82 patients with RUNX1/RUNX1T1 [67.8 %] and 39 patients with CBFB/MYH11 [32.2 %]) recruited from eight institutions in Korea. All patients received idarubicin plus cytarabine or behenoyl cytosine arabinoside 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy. The KIT gene mutation status was determined by direct sequencing analyses. A KIT mutation was detected in 32 cases (26.4 %) in our series of patients. The KIT mutation was most frequent in exon 17 (n = 18, 14.9 %; n = 16 with D816 mutation), followed by exon 8 (n = 10, 8.3 %). The presence of KIT D816 mutation was associated with adverse outcomes for the event-free survival (p = 0.03) and for the overall survival (p = 0.02). The unfavorable impact of D816 mutation was more prominent when the analysis was confined to the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 subtype. The KIT mutation was detected in 26.4 % of Korean patients with CBF AML. The KIT D816 mutation demonstrated an unfavorable prognostic implication, particularly in the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 subtype.((PMID:22912405))Core binding factor (CBF) leukemias, those with translocations or inversions that affect transcription factor genes RUNX1 or CBFB, account for ~24% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 25% of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Current treatments for CBF leukemias are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 5-y survival rate of ~50%. We hypothesize that the interaction between RUNX1 and CBFβ is critical for CBF leukemia and can be targeted for drug development. We developed high-throughput AlphaScreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) methods to quantify the RUNX1-CBFβ interaction and screen a library collection of 243,398 compounds. Ro5-3335, a benzodiazepine identified from the screen, was able to interact with RUNX1 and CBFβ directly, repress RUNX1/CBFB-dependent transactivation in reporter assays, and repress runx1-dependent hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. Ro5-3335 preferentially killed human CBF leukemia cell lines, rescued preleukemic phenotype in a RUNX1-ETO transgenic zebrafish, and reduced leukemia burden in a mouse CBFB-MYH11 leukemia model. Our data thus confirmed that RUNX1-CBFβ interaction can be targeted for leukemia treatment and we have identified a promising lead compound for this purpose.((PMID:22875911))The clinical value of serial minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by quantitative RT-PCR was prospectively assessed in 278 patients [163 with t(8;21) and 115 with inv(16)] entered in the United Kingdom MRC AML 15 trial. CBF transcripts were normalized to 10(5) ABL copies. At remission, after course 1 induction chemotherapy, a > 3 log reduction in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts in BM in t(8;21) patients and a > 10 CBFB-MYH11 copy number in peripheral blood (PB) in inv(16) patients were the most useful prognostic variables for relapse risk on multivariate analysis. MRD levels after consolidation (course 3) were also informative. During follow-up, cut-off MRD thresholds in BM and PB associated with a 100% relapse rate were identified: for t(8;21) patients BM > 500 copies, PB > 100 copies; for inv(16) patients, BM > 50 copies and PB > 10 copies. Rising MRD levels on serial monitoring accurately predicted hematologic relapse. During follow-up, PB sampling was equally informative as BM for MRD detection. We conclude that MRD monitoring by quantitative RT-PCR at specific time points in CBF AML allows identification of patients at high risk of relapse and could now be incorporated in clinical trials to evaluate the role of risk directed/preemptive therapy.((PMID:22722202))Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2008 alone. This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.((PMID:22491093))Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that involves the destruction of articular cartilage and eventually leads to disability. Molecules that promote the selective differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes may stimulate the repair of damaged cartilage. Using an image-based high-throughput screen, we identified the small molecule kartogenin, which promotes chondrocyte differentiation (median effective concentration = 100 nM), shows chondroprotective effects in vitro, and is efficacious in two OA animal models. Kartogenin binds filamin A, disrupts its interaction with the transcription factor core-binding factor β subunit (CBFβ), and induces chondrogenesis by regulating the CBFβ-RUNX1 transcriptional program. This work provides new insights into the control of chondrogenesis that may ultimately lead to a stem cell-based therapy for osteoarthritis.((PMID:22325351))Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play key roles in developmental epigenetic regulation. Yet the mechanisms that target PRCs to specific loci in mammalian cells remain incompletely understood. In this study we show that Bmi1, a core component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), binds directly to the Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex. Genome-wide studies in megakaryocytic cells demonstrate significant chromatin occupancy overlap between the PRC1 core component Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ and functional regulation of a considerable fraction of commonly bound genes. Bmi1/Ring1b and Runx1/CBFβ deficiencies generate partial phenocopies of one another in vivo. We also show that Ring1b occupies key Runx1 binding sites in primary murine thymocytes and that this occurs via PRC2-independent mechanisms. Genetic depletion of Runx1 results in reduced Ring1b binding at these sites in vivo. These findings provide evidence for site-specific PRC1 chromatin recruitment by core binding transcription factors in mammalian cells.((PMID:27667292))Fluorescence in situ hybridization examination of a pediatric AML patient whose bone marrow cells carried trisomy 4 and FLT3-ITD mutation, demonstrated that part of the RUNX1 probe had unexpectedly moved to chromosome band 6q25 indicating a cryptic t(6;21)(q25;q22) translocation. RNA sequencing showed fusion of exon 7 of RUNX1 with an intergenic sequence of 6q25 close to the MIR1202 locus, something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. The RUNX1 fusion transcript encodes a truncated protein containing the Runt homology domain responsible for both heterodimerization with CBFB and DNA binding, but lacking the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PST) region which is the transcription activation domain at the C terminal end. Which genetic event (+4, FLT3-ITD, t(6;21)-RUNX1 truncation or other, undetected acquired changes) was more pathogenetically important in the present case of AML, remains unknown. The case illustrates that submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements may accompany visible numerical changes and perhaps should be actively looked for whenever a single trisomy is found. An active search for them may provide both pathogenetic and prognostic novel information.((PMID:27632978))The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system defines recurrent chromosomal translocations as the sole diagnostic and prognostic criteria for acute leukemia (AL). These fusion transcripts are pivotal in the pathogenesis of AL. Clinical laboratories universally employ conventional karyotype/FISH to detect these chromosomal translocations, which is complex, labour intensive and lacks multiplexing capacity. Hence, it is imperative to explore and evaluate some newer automated, cost-efficient multiplexed technologies to accommodate the expanding genetic landscape in AL."nCounter® Leukemia fusion gene expression assay" by NanoString was employed to detect various fusion transcripts in a large set samples (n = 94) utilizing RNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) diagnostic bone marrow biopsy specimens. This series included AL patients with various recurrent translocations (n = 49), normal karyotype (n = 19), or complex karyotype (n = 21), as well as normal bone marrow samples (n = 5). Fusion gene expression data were compared with results obtained by conventional karyotype and FISH technology to determine sensitivity/specificity, as well as positive /negative predictive values.Junction probes for PML/RARA; RUNX1-RUNX1T1; BCR/ABL1 showed 100 % sensitivity/specificity. A high degree of correlation was noted for MLL/AF4 (85 sensitivity/100 specificity) and TCF3-PBX1 (75 % sensitivity/100 % specificity) probes. CBFB-MYH11 fusion probes showed moderate sensitivity (57 %) but high specificity (100 %). ETV6/RUNX1 displayed discordance between fusion transcript assay and FISH results as well as rare non-specific binding in AL samples with normal or complex cytogenetics.Our study presents preliminary data with high correlation between fusion transcript detection by a throughput automated multiplexed platform, compared to conventional karyotype/FISH technique for detection of chromosomal translocations in AL patients. Our preliminary observations, mandates further vast validation studies to explore automated molecular platforms in diagnostic pathology.((PMID:27512765))The identification of minimal residual disease (MRD) has led to substantial improvements in early recognition of the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Flow cytometry (FC), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization are useful methods for the detection of MRD in AML patients although molecular monitoring of leukemia-specific rearranged (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11) or mutated genetic (NPM1, CEBPA) sequences represents the most sensitive methodology. Besides, more than 50% of all AML patients lack one of these specific sequences, so it is crucial to identify molecular targets applicable for the majority of patients. WT1 is overexpressed at the mRNA level in 80–90% of AML cases at diagnosis in both peripheral blood and bone marrow, and is detectable in a consistent low range in normal donors. These features have led to its adoption for MRD detection using RQ-PCR. A European LeukemiaNet Study found the magnitude of WT1 log reduction after induction chemotherapy to be an independent predictor of relapse. Other studies showed a poorer outcome in patients having WT1 levels above reference thresholds at specific time points. WT1 expression was compared with other modalities of MRD assessment, such as RQ-PCR of specific fusion genes and FC, but no differences in terms of predictive value emerged. Finally, some authors translated the use of WT1 in the clinic giving donor lymphocytes infusions to patients with increasing WT1-mRNA levels after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and obtaining an improvement of survival in this subset. Data collected on WT1 expression over the past years provided evidence for the use of this molecular marker to stratify high-risk AML patients. It can also be used as a marker for early interventional therapy, but further studies are needed to demonstrate it.((PMID:27460049))Detection of leukemogenic fusion transcripts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is critical for AML diagnosis. NanoString nCounter system is a novel probe-based gene expression platform capable of measuring up to 800 targets with advantages of reproducibility, accuracy, and sample type flexibility. To study the potential application of NanoString in leukemia at clinic, we used this technology to detect AML leukemogenic fusion transcripts and compared the performances with clinical molecular assays.We developed a NanoString assay to detect seven leukemogenic fusion transcripts, namely RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (e5e12), PML-RARA (bcr1, bcr2, and bcr3), and CBFB-MYH11 (e5e12, e5e8, and e5e7). We set up the cut-off value for each fusion transcript and tested 42 de novo AML samples. We compared the results with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and TaqMan reverse quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR), the molecular methods standardly used at clinic.We demonstrated that the NanoString and RT-PCR results correlate well (P < 0.0001) and are highly concordant (95.2%). Using TaqMan RQ-PCR as a validation method and gold standard, we demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity of NanoString compared to RT-PCR and comparable specificity. Furthermore, we showed that NanoString is not as sensitive as TaqMan RQ-PCR in detecting very low level of fusion transcripts.NanoString can serve as a reliable and alternative molecular method to multiplexed RT-PCR for diagnosis of de novo AML with the perspective of screening/quantitation of a large number of leukemogenic fusion transcripts and prognostic genes. However, NanoString may not be an alternative method for monitoring minimal residual disease in AML.((PMID:27298396))To examine the value of minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We studied 42 patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and 51 with inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 Tandem MRD analyses by MFC and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed in 281 bone marrow (BM) samples.Grouping qRT-PCR levels as ≤0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10, and >10%, and reporting MFC (sensitivity, 0.1%-0.01%) as positive or negative, κ coefficient test showed no agreement between qRT-PCR and MFC in BM samples obtained postinduction (n = 44, κ = 0.041), and only weak agreement during consolidation (n = 108, κ = 0.083), maintenance/follow-up (n = 107, κ = 0.164), and salvage chemotherapy (n = 24, 0.376). In the post induction BM samples, while qRT-PCR <0.1% was associated with lower and ≥10% with higher AML relapse risk (P = .035), qRT-PCR between 0.1% to 1% and 1% to 10% failed to predict relapse. In the latter group with intermediate qRT-PCR results, MFC provided prognostic value for relapse (P = 0.006).MFC and qRT-PCR are complementary tests in monitoring CBF AML MRD.((PMID:27022003))Cytogenetic analyses of a consecutive series of 67 paediatric (median age 8 years; range 0-17) de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients revealed aberrations in 55 (82%) cases. The most common subgroups were KMT2A rearrangement (29%), normal karyotype (15%), RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (10%), deletions of 5q, 7q and/or 17p (9%), myeloid leukaemia associated with Down syndrome (7%), PML-RARA (7%) and CBFB-MYH11 (5%). Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analysis and exon sequencing of 100 genes, performed in 52 and 40 cases, respectively (39 overlapping), revealed ≥1 aberration in 89%; when adding cytogenetic data, this frequency increased to 98%. Uniparental isodisomies (UPIDs) were detected in 13% and copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 63% (median 2/case); three UPIDs and 22 CNAs were recurrent. Twenty-two genes were targeted by focal CNAs, including AEBP2 and PHF6 deletions and genes involved in AML-associated gene fusions. Deep sequencing identified mutations in 65% of cases (median 1/case). In total, 60 mutations were found in 30 genes, primarily those encoding signalling proteins (47%), transcription factors (25%), or epigenetic modifiers (13%). Twelve genes (BCOR, CEBPA, FLT3, GATA1, KIT, KRAS, NOTCH1, NPM1, NRAS, PTPN11, SMC3 and TP53) were recurrently mutated. We conclude that SNP-A and deep sequencing analyses complement the cytogenetic diagnosis of paediatric AML.((PMID:26890219))Cbfb is a cotranscription factor that forms a heterodimer with Runx proteins Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3. It is required for fetal liver hematopoiesis and skeletal development. Cbfb has two functional isoforms, Cbfb1 and Cbfb2, which are formed by alternative splicing. To address the biological functions of these isoforms in skeletal development, we examined Cbfb1(-/-) and Cbfb2(-/-) mouse embryos. Intramembranous and endochondral ossification was retarded and chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation was inhibited in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos but not in Cbfb1(-/-) embryos. Cbfb2 mRNA was upregulated in calvariae, limbs, livers, thymuses, and hearts of Cbfb1(-/-) embryos but Cbfb1 mRNA was not in those of Cbfb2(-/-) embryos, and the total amount of Cbfb1 and Cbfb2 mRNA in Cbfb1(-/-) embryos was similar to that in wild-type embryos but was severely reduced in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos. The absolute numbers of Cbfb2 mRNA in calvariae, limbs, livers, thymuses, and brains in wild-type embryos were about three times higher than those of Cbfb1 in the respective tissue. The levels of Runx proteins were reduced in calvariae, limbs, and primary osteoblasts from Cbfb2(-/-) embryos, but the reduction in Runx2 protein was very mild. Furthermore, the amounts of Runx proteins and Cbfb in Cbfb2(-/-) embryos differed similarly among skeletal tissues, livers, and thymuses, suggesting that Runx proteins and Cbfb are mutually required for their stability. Although Cbfb1(-/-) embryos developed normally, Cbfb1 induced chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and enhanced DNA binding of Runx2 more efficiently than Cbfb2. Our results indicate that modulations in the relative levels of the isoforms may adjust transcriptional activation by Runx2 to appropriate physiological levels. Cbfb2 was more abundant, but Cbfb1 was more potent for enhancing Runx2 activity. Although only Cbfb2 loss generated overt skeletal phenotypes, both may play major roles in skeletal development with functional redundancy. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.((PMID:26165235))RUNX1 and CBFB are among the most frequently mutated genes in human leukemias. Genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations, copy number variations and point mutations have been widely reported to result in the malfunction of RUNX transcription factors. Leukemias arising from such alterations in RUNX family genes are collectively termed core binding factor (CBF) leukemias. Although adult CBF leukemias generally are considered a favorable risk group as compared with other forms of acute myeloid leukemia, the 5-year survival rate remains low. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanism for CBF leukemia is imperative to uncover novel treatment options. Over the years, retroviral transduction-transplantation assays and transgenic, knockin and knockout mouse models alone or in combination with mutagenesis have been used to study the roles of RUNX alterations in leukemogenesis. Although successful in inducing leukemia, the existing assays and models possess many inherent limitations. A CBF leukemia model which induces leukemia with complete penetrance and short latency would be ideal as a platform for drug discovery. Here, we summarize the currently available mouse models which have been utilized to study CBF leukemias, discuss the advantages and limitations of individual experimental systems, and propose suggestions for improvements of mouse models.((PMID:25732229))In a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following therapy, finding ≥5% bone marrow (BM) blasts is highly concerning for residual/relapsed disease. Over an 18-month period, we performed multicolor flow cytometry immunophenotyping (MFC) for AML minimal residual disease on >4,000 BM samples, and identified 41 patients who had ≥5% myeloblasts by morphology but negative by MFC. At the time of a negative MFC study, an abnormal cytogenetic study converted to negative in 14 patients and remained positive at a low level (2.5-9.5%) by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 3 (14%), of the latter, abnormalities subsequently disappeared in the repeated BM in 2 patients. Positive pretreatment mutations, including FLT3, NPM1, IDH1, CEBPA, became negative in all 10 patients tested. Of the seven patients with favorable cytogenetics, PML/RARA, CBFB-MYH11 or RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts were detected at various levels in six patients but all patients remained in complete remission. With no additional chemotherapy given, 39 patients had BM repeated (median 2 weeks, range <1-21), and all cases showed <5% BM blasts and a continuously negative MFC. In the end of follow-up (median 10 months, range 1-22), 13 patients experienced relapse, 12/13 showing clonal cytogenetic evolution/switch and 11 demonstrating major immunophenotypic shifts. We conclude that MFC is useful in identifying a regenerating BM sample with ≥5% BM blasts that would otherwise be scored as positive using standard morphologic examination. We believe this conclusion is supported by the changes in molecular cytogenetic status and the patient clinical follow-up data.((PMID:25715404))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia is a favorable acute myeloid leukemia subset cytogenetically defined by t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16) rearrangements, disrupting RUNX1 (previously CBFA/AML1) or CBFB transcription factor functions. The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is expressed in the vast majority of these acute myeloid leukemias and frequent activating KIT gene mutations have been associated with a higher risk of relapse. This phase II study aimed to evaluate dasatinib as maintenance therapy in patients with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia in first hematologic complete remission, but at higher risk of relapse due to molecular disease persistence or recurrence. A total of 26 patients aged 18-60 years old previously included in the CBF-2006 trial were eligible to receive dasatinib 140 mg daily if they had a poor initial molecular response (n=18) or a molecular recurrence (n=8). The tolerance of dasatinib as maintenance therapy was satisfactory. The 2-year disease-free survival in this high-risk population of patients was 25.7%. All but one patient with molecular recurrence presented subsequent hematologic relapse. Patients with slow initial molecular response had a similar disease-free survival when treated with dasatinib (40.2% at 2 years) or without any maintenance (50.0% at 2 years). The disappearance of KIT gene mutations at relapse suggests that clonal devolution may in part explain the absence of efficacy observed with single-agent dasatinib in these patients (n. EudraCT: 2006-006555-12).((PMID:25635758))In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) and/or the corresponding molecular rearrangements RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and CBFB/MYH11 [collectively referred to as core binding factor (CBF) AML] predict for a more favourable outcome in patients receiving cytarabine-anthracycline based induction and upon achievement of complete remission, high-dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy. However, 40-45% of these patients eventually relapse and die of their disease. Here, we review emerging molecular and therapeutic results that may be used to guide the clinical management of this subset of patients.Integration of cytogenetic results with molecular genetic and epigenetic data refines the diagnosis, classification and risk-stratification of CBF AML. Clinical studies with targeting compounds (e.g. gemtuzumab ozogamicin, dasatinib) added to intensive chemotherapy appear beneficial both in younger and older patients, albeit the latter continue to have a significantly worse outcome than the former. Regularly molecular monitoring of disease during remission may provide a strategy for early therapeutic intervention before overt relapse.Emerging evidence supports that novel diagnostic, treatment and molecular disease monitoring approaches may improve the prognosis of CBF AML.((PMID:25348871))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) - including AML with t(8;21) and AML with inv(16) - accounts for about 15% of adult AML and is associated with a relatively favorable prognosis. Nonetheless, relapse incidence may reach 40% in these patients. In this context, identification of prognostic markers is considered of great interest. Due to similarities between their molecular and prognostic features, t(8;21) and inv(16)-AML are usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies. However, considerable experimental evidences have highlighted that they represent two distinct entities and should be considered separately for further studies. This review summarizes recent laboratory and clinical findings in this particular subset of AML and how they could be used to improve management of patients in routine practice.((PMID:27468869))The diagnostics of leukemia relies upon multi-parametric approach involving a number of different pathology disciplines such as flow cytometry, histopathology, cytogenetics and molecular genetics [fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. Childhood leukemia is often determined by the presence of specific chromosomal translocation that entails the generation of preleukemic fusion genes (PFG). In the last two decades, several studies have reported observations that PFG are present in healthy population and not necessarily result in leukemia. The first such study by Limpens and colleagues on t(14/18)/ BCL2-JH [1] and next in line [2, 3] led to many questions regarding the significance of these chromosomal translocations in leukemogenesis. However, the data on the incidence of PFG are contradictive. This review aims to highlight the molecular genetic approaches used by various studies with regard to differences in diagnostics and incidence of PFG in healthy subjects. The focus is on the incidence and prevalence of the most common PFG such as TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4, BCR-ABL (p190), AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11 detected in umbilical cord blood, in neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards (GC)), bone marrow, peripheral blood and tissues of amortized fetuses. We conclude that the incidence of PFG is significantly higher than incidence of leukemia and more sophisticated analysis of PFG in leukemogenic cell populations is warranted to relate the occurrence of PFG with leukemia. The emerging notion is that only those PFG may contribute to development of leukemia which arise in stem cells at specific time windows during development. Thus, screening of PFG in subpopulations of stem cells may be a challenge for assessment of predisposition to leukemia and for validation of cell transplant to minimize donor cell-derived leukemia.((PMID:26299742))In this work, we evaluated the incidence and prognostic value of several genetic aberrations in patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).We analysed 90 patients: 42 males (mean age 54.5 years) and 48 females (mean age 59 years), with AML. The genetics of all leukemia samples was studied using conventional cytogenetics, the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation as well as the standardized RTPCR protocol.In 34.4% of patients, we detected at least one of the analysed genetic aberrations, except the CBFB MYH11, which we did not detect. Translocation t(8;21)/ AML1 ETO was found in 4.4% of patients with a mean age of 45.4 years, while none of these patients was older than 55 years. Translocation t(15;17)/ PMLRARA was found in 5.5% of patients with a mean age of 52.6 years and an almost equal distribution between younger and older patients. The MLL gene rearrangements were found in 6.6% of patients, the -5/ 5q- and/ or -7/ 7q- aberrations in 7.7% of patients, while the most frequent genetic abnormality in our study was trisomy 8 (10%). Moreover, we found a favorable clinical outcome in patients expressing fusion genes AML1-ETO or PMLRARA in contrast to an adverse clinical outcome with few remissions and death in AML patients with MLL, -5q/ -5 and -7q/ 7-. Finally, an intermediate prognosis was found in patients with trisomy 8.In this study, we found a good congruence with published literature on the incidence and prognostic value of several well established AML-associated genetic aberrations. This simple genetic-based classification system helps us to identify patients with a favorable, intermediate or unfavorable prognosis and to treat them with the best currently available therapy. However, analysis of new genetically defined abnormalities in AML is necessary for development of better therapeutic strategies and/or diagnostics.((PMID:24602728))To investigate the clinical value of multiplex nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-nPCR) in screening acute myeloid leukemia(AML)fusion genes.A novel multiplex RT-nPCR assay was developed to detect 16 AML-related fusion genes (AML1-EVI1, AML1-ETO, AML1-MDS1, AML1-MTG16, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, MLL-MLL, PML-RARα, PLZFRARα, NPM1-RARα, CBFB-MYH11, DEK-CAN, SET-CAN and TLS-ERG) according to 2008 WHO classification of AML. The chromosome reciprocal translocations of 356 AML cases were detected by multiplex RT-nPCR and karyotyping. The positive samples were further confirmed by split- out PCR and FISH.The fusion genes were detected in 172 patients with the positive detection rate of 48.31%(172/356), which was higher than that of karyotyping (31.46%) (χ²=70.314, P<0.01). Multiplex RT-nPCR is superior to karyotyping and FISH in identifying the rare, cryptic chromosome translocation (χ²=96.074, P<0.01).The multiplex RT-nPCR used in this study can quickly, effectively and accurately screen the fusion genes in AML patients, which can provide important evidence for assessing diagnosis and treatment, and also provide necessary information for minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognosis.((PMID:23257420))Within the past few years, the invention of next-generation sequencing has revealed several new genes associated with tumor formation and development, for example DNMT3a. This gene is an independent prognostic factor for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The objective of this study was to analyze the DNMT3a mutation in childhood AML in a single center. PCR amplification of the entire coding region of DNMT3a was performed using 23 overlapping primer pairs in 57 patients who were diagnosed in Blood Disease Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, then the directly sequencing was underwent. The results showed that no DNMT3a mutation was found in these patients including the hotspot R882. But AML1/ETO mutation was found in 10 patients, CBFB/MYH11 mutation in 3 patients, PML/RARa mutation in 13 patients, FLT3/ITD mutation in 5 patients, FLT3/TKD mutation in 1 patient, PML/RARa and FLT3/TKD mutation coexisted in 2 patients. It is concluded that DNMT3a mutations are rare in childhood AML, and different mechanisms of myeloid leukemogenesis between childhood and adults maybe involved.((PMID:22196957))Despite a high remission rate, a significant number of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. Thus, the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML is an important strategy to better identify high risk patients. Most sensitive methodology to detect MRD is molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) but its applicability is restricted to AML with leukemia-specific molecular targets (e.g. AML1-ETO, CBFB-MYH11, MLL, FLT-3). In our study, MRD was monitored at different time points with both MFC and WT1-RNA quantification in 23 AML patients who did not present specific molecular targets. As previously published, we considered values of 10(-3) (0.1%) in MFC and 90 WT1-RNA × 10(4) ABL copies as optimal thresholds. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to confirm these data. To realize the methodology that better identify high risk patients, an analysis of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (PV) and likelihood ratio (LR) was provided and similar results were showed. MRD levels ≥ 10(-3) in MFC as well MRD levels ≥ 90 WT1-RNA copies in RQ-PCR, identify risk groups of patients with poor prognosis. Therefore, MFC and WT1-RNA quantification showed a comparable capacity in terms of technical performance and clinical significance to identify high risk patients who eventually relapsed.((PMID:22145956))The KIT D816V mutation is detected in the vast majority of adult cases of systemic mastocytosis (SM). The mutation is also frequently detected in core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF AML) defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)(p13.1;q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 chromosomal rearrangements, but whether the mutation is indicative of associated SM is unclear. In the present study, patients with CBF AML were therefore analyzed for the KIT D816V mutation and mutation positive cases subsequently analyzed for the presence of SM. The KIT D816V mutation was detected in eight of 20 cases of CBF AML, with the frequency in t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13.1;q22) positive cases being 31% and 57%, respectively. The fraction of KIT D816V mutation positive cells was highly variable among the eight mutation positive patients, with levels ranging from 0.04 to 98% in a pretreatment blood sample. Five of the eight cases carried the mutation in a cell fraction below one-tenth of the blast cell fraction, thus suggesting that KIT mutation is often a late event in leukemogenesis. None of the eight KIT D816V mutation positive cases fulfilled the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria of SM. The presence of the KIT D816V mutation in the CBF AML subgroup can therefore not be considered indicative of associated SM.((PMID:22032582))Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cytogenetically defined by the presence of t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), commonly abbreviated as t(8;21) and inv(16), respectively. In both subtypes, the cytogenetic rearrangements disrupt genes that encode subunits of core-binding factor, a transcription factor that functions as an essential regulator of normal hematopoiesis. The rearrangements t(8;21) and inv(16) involve the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 ( AML1-ETO ) and CBFB/MYH11 genes, respectively. These 2 subtypes are categorized as AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, and hence the cytogenetic fusion transcripts are considered diagnostic of acute leukemia even when the marrow blast count is less than 20%. The t(8;21) and inv(16) subtypes of AML have been usually grouped and reported together in clinical studies; however, recent studies have demonstrated genetic, clinical, and prognostic differences, supporting the notion that they represent 2 distinct biologic and clinical entities. This review summarizes the spectrum of this subset of AMLs, with particular emphasis on molecular genetics and pathologic findings.((PMID:21354057))Leukemia- and lymphoma-associated (LLA) chromosomal rearrangements are critical in the process of tumorigenesis. These genetic alterations are also important biological markers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of hematopoietic malignant diseases. To detect the presence or absence of these genetic alterations in healthy individuals, sensitive nested RT-PCR analyses were performed on a large number of peripheral blood samples for selected markers including MLL partial tandem duplications (PTDs), BCR-ABL p190, BCR-ABL p210, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11. Using nested RT-PCR, the presence of all of these selected markers was detected in healthy individuals at various prevalence rates. No correlation was observed between incidence and age except for BCR-ABL p210 fusion, the incidence of which rises with increasing age. In addition, nested RT-PCR was performed on a large cohort of umbilical cord blood samples for MLL PTD, BCR-ABL p190 and BCR-ABL p210. The results demonstrated the presence of these aberrations in cord blood from healthy neonates. To our knowledge, the presence of PML-RARA and CBFB-MYH11 in healthy individuals has not been previously described. The present study provides further evidence for the presence of LLA genetic alterations in healthy individuals and suggests that these mutations are not themselves sufficient for malignant transformation.((PMID:21344764))The aim of the paper is to present the initial results of molecular examination which was started in 2006 for children with acute myeloid leukemia. Better knowledge of biology of this disease, can result in establishing of new risk factors what allows more precise patient stratification to different therapeutic groups. Study was obtained patients until to 18 years of age treated according to AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol in 14 centers of the Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. Mononuclear cells were collected from bone marrow on time points established according to the AML-BFM 2004 INTERIM protocol. Collected cells were isolated on Ficoll gradient, and RNA and DNA were isolated using TRIZOL reagent. To synthesize cDNA an amount of 1 mg of total RNA was used. To perform quantitative RT-PCR and RQ-PCR reactions 4 fusion gene transcripts (AML1-ETO, CBFb-MYH11, PML-RARA /subtype bcrl and bcr3/) were used according to the protocol established by Europe Against Cancer Program. An expression of WT1 gene was tested additionally. An analysis of ABL control gene was used to normalize of achieved results. Determination of duplication of FLT3 gene in DNA sample was performed with starters complementary to JM region. Genotyping was performed in 75 patients with acute myeloid leukemia so far. AML1-ETO fusion gene transcript was found in 14 patients (19%). PML-RARA (subtype bcr3) and CBFB-MYH11 gene transcripts were detected in 3 (4%) and 3 (4%) patients, respectively. Duplication of FLT3 gene was found in 4 (5.3%) cases. Between 67 tested children over expression of WT1 was present in 51 patients (76%). Analysis of MRD level in subsequent time points showed systematic decrease of number of fusion gene transcript copies and gene WT1 expression. To establish the rate of molecular marker presence in AML in children and the influence of the presence of MRD on the treatment results as well, the study has to be conducted on a larger group of patients with longer follow-up.((PMID:21198299))Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) accounts for 15 to 25 percent of childhood acute leukemias. The most common genetic abnormalities seen in pediatric AML patients are AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes resulting in t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16). These genetic defects are seen in approximately 20-25% of AML patients.We investigated in this study, incidence and prognostic significance of the AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes in children with AML.The authors analyzed 34 children with AML using the real time-polymerase chain reaction for AML1-ETO, PML-RARα and CBFB-MYH11 genes.Of the patients, 8.8% were positive for t(8;21), 8.8% for t(15;17) and 3% for inv(16). There were a statistically significant differences between 48 month overall survival rates of the patients positive and negative for t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16).It was concluded that t(15;17), t(8;21) and inv(16) impact on disease prognosis positively, but comprehensive studies with larger patient series are now needed for confirmation.((PMID:21123134))Nowadays, the presence of specific genetic aberrations is progressively used for classification and treatment stratification, because acute leukemias with the same oncogenetic aberration generally form a clinically and diagnostically homogenous disease entity with comparable prognosis. Many oncogenetic aberrations in acute leukemias result in a fusion gene, which is transcribed into fusion transcripts and translated into fusion proteins, which are assumed to play a critical role in the oncogenetic process. Fusion gene aberrations are detected by karyotyping, FISH, or RT-PCR analysis. However, these molecular genetic techniques are laborious and time consuming, which is in contrast to flow cytometric techniques. Therefore we developed a flow cytometric immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins in lysates of leukemia cell samples by use of a bead-bound catching antibody against one side of the fusion protein and fluorochrome-conjugated detection antibody. So far, we have been able to design such fusion protein immunobead assays for BCR-ABL, PML-RARA, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11. The immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins can be performed within 3 to 4 hours in a routine diagnostic setting, without the need of special equipment other than a flow cytometer. The novel immunobead assay will enable fast and easy classification of acute leukemia patients that express fusion proteins. Such patients can be included at an early stage in the right treatment protocols, much faster than by use of current molecular techniques. The immunobead assay can be run in parallel to routine immunophenotyping and is particularly attractive for clinical settings without direct access to molecular diagnostics.((PMID:21120205))Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis can provide important information in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies. However, FISH performed in addition to G-banded karyotype can be labor-intensive and expensive. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether FISH gives additional information in the setting of adequate conventional cytogenetics in cases of hematologic malignancies.Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from 135 patients at diagnosis (56 AML, 32 MDS, 20 ALL, and 27 MM) between 2005 and 2010. Interphase FISH was performed using the following probes: BCR/ABL1, AML1/ETO, PML/RARA, CBFB, MLL, EGR1, CEP8, and D7S486 for AML; CEP8, D20S108, EGR1, and D7S486 for MDS; BCR/ABL1, MLL, CDKN2A (p16), ETV6, and 6q21/c-myc for ALL; IgH, TP53, D13S25, IgH/CCND1, IgH/MAF, IgH/FGFR3, and 1q21/8p21 for MM. We compared the results of FISH with the corresponding aberrations identified by G-banded karyotype.Additional genetic aberrations detected by FISH (which were not identified by G-banded karyotype) were 4%, 9%, 50%, and 67% in AML, MDS, ALL, and MM, respectively. In ALL, CDKN2A and ETV6 FISH revealed additional genetic aberrations in 33% and 28% of cases, respectively. In MM, FISH was of benefit in detecting IgH, D13S25, TP53, and 1q21 rearrangements, not detected by G-banded karyotype (31%, 36%, 20%, and 40%, respectively).These results suggest that performing FISH in addition to G-banded karyotype may contribute little additional genetic information in AML and MDS, whereas routine FISH analysis appears to be an efficient screening method in ALL and MM.((PMID:20931398))MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are postulated to be important regulators in various cancers, including leukemia. In a large-scale miRNA expression profiling analysis of 435 human miRNAs in 52 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, we found that miR-126 and its minor counterpart in biogenesis, namely, miR-126*, were specifically aberrantly overexpressed in core binding factor (CBF) AMLs including both t(8;21)/AML1-ETO and inv(16)/CBFB-MYH11 samples. Our in vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that forced expression of miR-126 inhibited apoptosis and increased the viability of AML cells, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous expression of miR-126 was knocked down. In addition, through in vitro colony-forming/replating assays, we demonstrated that forced expression of miR-126 enhanced proliferation and colony-forming/replating capacity of mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells alone and particularly, in cooperation with AML1-ETO, a fusion gene resulting from t(8;21). Thus, our data shows that miR-126 may play a critical role in the development of CBF leukemias. In the present chapter, the materials and protocols for the study of miR-126 in leukemia are described.((PMID:20808941))Aberrant promoter DNA methylation has been shown to play a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathophysiology. However, further studies to discuss the prognostic value and the relationship of the epigenetic signatures with defined genomic rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia are required.We carried out high-throughput methylation profiling on 116 de novo AML cases and we validated the significant biomarkers in an independent cohort of 244 AML cases. Methylation signatures were associated with the presence of a specific cytogenetic status. In normal karyotype cases, aberrant methylation of the promoter of DBC1 was validated as a predictor of the disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, DBC1 expression was significantly silenced in the aberrantly methylated samples. Patients with chromosome rearrangements showed distinct methylation signatures. To establish the role of fusion proteins in the epigenetic profiles, 20 additional samples of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced with common fusion genes were studied and compared with patient samples carrying the same rearrangements. The presence of MLL rearrangements in HSPC induced the methylation profile observed in the MLL-positive primary samples. In contrast, fusion genes such as AML1/ETO or CBFB/MYH11 failed to reproduce the epigenetic signature observed in the patients.Our study provides a comprehensive epigenetic profiling of AML, identifies new clinical markers for cases with a normal karyotype, and reveals relevant biological information related to the role of fusion proteins on the methylation signature.((PMID:15156186))Inv(16)(p13q22) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia subtype M4Eo that is characterized by the presence of myelomonocytic blasts and atypical eosinophils. This chromosomal rearrangement results in the fusion of CBFB and MYH11 genes. CBF beta normally interacts with RUNX1 to form a transcriptionally active nuclear complex. The MYH11 gene encodes the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The CBF beta-SMMHC fusion protein is capable of binding to RUNX1 and form dimers and multimers through its myosin tail. Previous results from transgenic mouse models show that Cbfb-MYH11 is able to inhibit dominantly Runx1 function in hematopoiesis, and is a key player in the pathogenesis of leukemia. In recent years, molecular and cellular biological studies have led to the proposal of several models to explain the function of CBF beta-SMMHC. In this review, we will first focus our attention on the molecular mechanisms proposed in the recent publications. We will next examine recent gene expression profiling studies on inv(16) leukemia cells. Finally, we will describe a recent study from one of our labs on the identification of cooperating genes for leukemogenesis with CBFB-MYH11.((PMID:12434152))Core-binding factor beta (CBFbeta, also called polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2beta (PEBP2B)) is associated with an inversion of chromosome 16 and is associated with acute myeloid leukemia in humans. CBFbeta forms a heterodimer with RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1), which has a DNA binding domain homologous to the pair-rule protein runt in Drosophila melanogaster. Both RUNX1 and CBFbeta are essential for hematopoiesis. Haploinsufficiency of another runt-related protein, RUNX2 (also called CBFA1), causes cleidocranial dysplasia in humans and is essential in skeletal development by regulating osteoblast differentiation and chondrocyte maturation. Mice deficient in Cbfb (Cbfb(-/-)) die at midgestation, so the function of Cbfbeta in skeletal development has yet to be ascertained. To investigate this issue, we rescued hematopoiesis of Cbfb(-/-) mice by introducing Cbfb using the Gata1 promoter. The rescued Cbfb(-/-) mice recapitulated fetal liver hematopoiesis in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and survived until birth, but showed severely delayed bone formation. Although mesenchymal cells differentiated into immature osteoblasts, intramembranous bones were poorly formed. The maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic cells was markedly delayed, and no endochondral bones were formed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter assays showed that Cbfbeta was necessary for the efficient DNA binding of Runx2 and for Runx2-dependent transcriptional activation. These findings indicate that Cbfbeta is required for the function of Runx2 in skeletal development.((PMID:23597428))Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) regulates both glucose metabolism and bone mass. Evidence suggests that the therapeutic modulation of PPARγ with synthetic agonists activity may elicit undesirable effects on bone. However, there is no information regarding its natural agonist 15d-PGJ2, besides its excellent anti-inflammatory action. In the present study the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on osteoblastic cells were determined. Osteoblastic cells (MC3T3) were cultured in an osteogenic medium in the presence of 1, 3 or 10 μM of 15d-PGJ2 during 21 days and alizarin and Von Kossa staining were employed. The protein expression (type-I collagen, osteonectin, osteopontin, RANKL, osteoprotegerin, HDAC-9c and PPAR-γ) was evaluated after 3 days in the presence of 15d-PGJ2 by western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence methods. The production of mineralized extracellular matrix was observed by transmission electron microscopy. After 72 h of culture, the mRNA was extracted for RT-qPCR analysis of RUNX expression. In the presence of all 3 tested 15d-PGJ2 doses, alizarin red and Von kossa staining were positive demonstrating the ability to the osteoblast differentiation. Type-I collagen and osteonectin proteins expression were up-regulated (p < 0.05) after 72 h in the presence of the smaller doses of 15d-PGJ2. In contrast, osteopontin, RANKL and OPG expression did not significantly alter. In the presence of 15d-PGJ2 it was possible to visualize mineralized nodules in the extracellular matrix confirmed with the increased RUNX mRNA expression. 15d-PGJ2 at small doses increased the osteoblast activity and the bone-related proteins expression.((PMID:23319320))Adipose tissue is a potential site of retinoic acid (RA) action, but its physiological significance remains to be clarified. We have examined the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on growth and differentiation of preadipocytes, and on adipokine gene expression in mature adipocytes using human preadipocyte cell model, AML-I. Both ATRA and 9-cis RA induced growth arrest in AML-I preadipocyte at between 50 and 100 µM, which was accompanied by apoptosis. Western blotting showed a loss of NF-κB, Bcl-2 and p-Akt, and the accumulation of Bad and Akt in cytoplasm of ATRA-treated AML-I preadipocytes. Exposure of AML-I to ATRA or 9-cis RA increased intracellular lipid accumulation in a time-dependent manner compared to vehicle-treated cells. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) proteins was increased in ATRA-treated cells. Thus, both ATRA and 9-cis RA promoted differentiation, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML-I preadipocytes. ATRA also modulated adipokine expression by increasing the mRNA level of adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin and LPL), and by inhibiting PAI-1 mRNA expression in mature AML-I adipocytes. The data suggest that ATRA exerts a wide range of effects--growth arrest, apoptosis, lipogenesis and modulation of adipokine gene expression--during the maturation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.((PMID:23200915))Gene methylation and other epigenetic modifications of gene regulation have been implicated in the growth of ovarian cancer, but the clinical significance of such modifications in the Notch pathway in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) is not well understood. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to study the clinical relevance of epigenetic modifications of Notch superfamily genes.We analyzed the interaction of DNA methylation and miRNAs with gene expression data for Notch superfamily members with the Spearman rank correlation test and explored potential relationships with overall survival (OS) with the log-rank test. We downloaded clinical data, level 3 gene expression data, and level 3 DNA methylation data for 480 patients with stage II-IV HGS-OvCa from the TCGA data portal. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts for survival analyses. In each set, patients were grouped into percentiles according to methylation and microRNA (miRNA) or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. We used several algorithms to predict miRNA-mRNA interaction.There were significant inverse relationships between methylation status and mRNA expression for PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1. For each of these genes, patients with a lower methylation level and higher expression level had significantly poorer OS than did patients with a higher methylation level and lower expression level. We also found a significant inverse relationship between miRNAs and mRNA expression for CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1. By further analyzing the effect of miRNAs on gene expression and OS, we found that patients with higher levels of CCND1, PPARG, and RUNX1 expression and lower expression levels of their respective miRNAs (502-5p, 128, and 215/625) had significantly poorer OS.Epigenetic alterations of multiple Notch target genes and pathway interacting genes (PPARG, CCND1, and RUNX1) may relate to activation of this pathway and poor survival of patients with HGS-OvCa.((PMID:22541023))Muscle satellite cells are largely responsible for skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Side population (SP) cells, which are thought to be muscle stem cells, also contribute to muscle regeneration. SP cells exhibit high mesenchymal potential, and are a possible cell source for therapy of muscular dystrophy. However, the mechanism by which muscle SP cells are committed to differentiation is poorly understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in modulating a variety of cellular processes through repression of their mRNA targets. In skeletal muscle, miRNAs are known to be involved in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. To investigate mechanisms of SP cell regulation, we profiled miRNA expression in SP cells and main population (MP) cells in muscles using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based expression assays. We identified a set of miRNAs that was highly expressed in SP cells as compared with MP cells. One miRNA, miR-128a, was elevated in expression in SP cells, but decreased in expression during continued culture in vitro. Overexpression of miR-128a in SP cells resulted in inhibited cell proliferation. The differentiation potential of SP cells was also decreased when miR-128a was overexpressed. MiR-128a was found to regulate the target genes involved in the regulation of adipogenic-, osteogenic- and myogenic genes that include: PPARγ, Runx1, and Pax3. Overexpression of miR-128a suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter fused to the 3'-untranslated region of each gene. These results demonstrate that miR-128a contributes to the maintenance of the quiescent state, and it regulates cellular differentiation by repressing individual genes in SP cells.((PMID:19664990))Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (Sfrp1) is highly expressed by stromal cells maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Sfrp1 loss in stromal cells increases production of hematopoietic progenitors, and in knockout mice, dysregulates hemostasis and increases Flk2- Cd34- Lin- Sca1+ Kit+ (LSK) cell numbers in bone marrow. Also, LSK and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) resided mainly in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, with an accompanying decrease in intracellular beta-catenin levels. Gene-expression studies showed a concomitant decrease Ccnd1 and Dkk1 in Cd34- LSK cells and increased expression of Pparg, Hes1, and Runx1 in MPP. Transplantation experiments showed no intrinsic effect of Sfrp1 loss on the number of HSCs or their ability to engraft irradiated recipients. In contrast, serial transplantations of wild-type HSCs into Sfrp1(-/-) mice show a progressive decrease of wild-type LSK and MPP numbers. Our results demonstrate that Sfrp1 is required to maintain HSC homeostasis through extrinsic regulation of beta-catenin.((PMID:27222482))Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is the most common form of the glomerular disease with unclear molecular mechanisms, which related to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to characterize differentially expressed genes in the normal and adriamycin-induced CGN rats by microarray analysis, and to determine the potential molecular mechanisms of CGN pathogenesis.For the gene expression analysis, fresh glomerular tissues from both normal and adriamycin treated rats (n=4, respectively) were collected. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to Agilent Rat 4×44 K whole genome microarray. KEGG, Gene Ontology (GO) analyze, LIMMA, String and Cytoscape software were applied to screen and analyze differentially regulated genes. In addition, the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to verify the selected genes.2334 differentially regulated genes were identified including 1294 up-regulated genes and 1040 down-regulated genes. According to the results of Generank, String and Cytoscape analyses, 27 genes may be key controlled genes in the pathogenesis of CGN, including 14 up-regulated genes (Fos, Myc, Kng1, Rac2, Pik3r1, Egr1, Icam1, Syk, Anxa1, Lgals3, Ptprc, Runx1, Itgb7, Ccl6) and 13 down-regulated genes (Aldh2, Dpyd, Mthfd1, Gldc, Ppar-α, Igf1, Pomc, Oas1a, Gsr, Acox1, Cyp1a1, Ugt2b15, Hsd3b6), which primarily contribute to biological processes such as, cell cycle, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, immune response, metabolic process, and so on. Fos and Syk were considered as potent hub genes.Global gene expression profile analysis showed that the molecular mechanism of CGN pathogenesis may be related to the promotion of cell cycle and mitosis, dysregulation of cytokine secretion and disordered inflammatory response as well as abnormal metabolism.((PMID:24359430))We previously demonstrated that primary Th1Th17 cells are highly permissive to HIV-1, whereas Th1 cells are relatively resistant. Molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown.Exposure to replication competent and single-round VSV-G pseudotyped HIV strains provide evidence that superior HIV replication in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells was regulated by mechanisms located at entry and post-entry levels. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling identified transcripts upregulated (n = 264) and downregulated (n = 235) in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells (p-value < 0.05; fold change cut-off 1.3). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed pathways enriched in Th1Th17 (nuclear receptors, trafficking, p38/MAPK, NF-κB, p53/Ras, IL-23) vs. Th1 cells (proteasome, interferon α/β). Differentially expressed genes were classified into biological categories using Gene Ontology. Th1Th17 cells expressed typical Th17 markers (IL-17A/F, IL-22, CCL20, RORC, IL-26, IL-23R, CCR6) and transcripts functionally linked to regulating cell trafficking (CEACAM1, MCAM), activation (CD28, CD40LG, TNFSF13B, TNFSF25, PTPN13, MAP3K4, LTB, CTSH), transcription (PPARγ, RUNX1, ATF5, ARNTL), apoptosis (FASLG), and HIV infection (CXCR6, FURIN). Differential expression of CXCR6, PPARγ, ARNTL, PTPN13, MAP3K4, CTSH, SERPINB6, PTK2, and ISG20 was validated by RT-PCR, flow cytometry and/or confocal microscopy. The nuclear receptor PPARγ was preferentially expressed by Th1Th17 cells. PPARγ RNA interference significantly increased HIV replication at levels post-entry and prior HIV-DNA integration. Finally, the activation of PPARγ pathway via the agonist Rosiglitazone induced the nuclear translocation of PPARγ and a robust inhibition of viral replication.Thus, transcriptional profiling in Th1Th17 vs. Th1 cells demonstrated that HIV permissiveness is associated with a superior state of cellular activation and limited antiviral properties and identified PPARγ as an intrinsic negative regulator of viral replication. Therefore, triggering PPARγ pathway via non-toxic agonists may contribute to limiting covert HIV replication and disease progression during antiretroviral treatment.((PMID:27689744))FAXDC2 (fatty acid hydroxylase domain containing 2) is a member of the fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily. Given the important role of fatty acids in megakaryocytes, we have studied the role of this gene in the development of this lineage. Here we show that the expression of FAXDC2 is constantly elevated during megakaryocyte maturation. In contrast, FAXDC2 is significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Moreover, FAXDC2 overexpression promotes the differentiation of megakaryocytic cell lines and primary cells, whereas its knockdown disrupts their maturation. Mechanism study shows that FAXDC2 overexpression enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and increases RUNX1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1) expression. FAXDC2 also restores megakaryocytic differentiation in cells exposed to an ERK inhibitor or those expressing a dominant negative form of RUNX1. Finally, FAXDC2 overexpression leads to an increase in sphingolipid GM3 synthase, suggesting a potential role of FAXDC2 in lipid metabolism that increases ERK signaling and facilitates megakaryocyte differentiation. Together, these results show that FAXDC2 plays a novel role in development of megakaryocytes and its dysregulation may contribute to abnormal hematopoietic cell development in leukemia.((PMID:27683100))The National Pediatric Oncology Unit (UNOP) is the only pediatric hemato-oncology center in Guatemala.Patients ages 1 to 17 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated according to modified ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (IC-BFM) 2002 protocol. Risk classification was based on age, white blood cell count, immunophenotype, genetics (when available), and early response to therapy.From July 2007 to June 2014, 787 patients were treated, including 160 who had standard-risk ALL, 450 who had intermediate-risk ALL, and 177 who had high-risk ALL. The induction death rate was 6.6%, and the remission rate was 92.9%. The rates of death and treatment abandonment during first complete remission were 4.8% and 2.5%, respectively. At a median observation time of 3.6 years, and with abandonment considered an event, the 5-year event-free survival and overall survival estimates ( ± standard error) were 56.2% ± 2.1% and 64.1% ± 2.1%, respectively, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse of 28.9% ± 2.0%. Twenty-one of 281 patients (7.5%) investigated were positive for the ets variant 6/runt-related transcription factor 1 (ETV6/RUNX1) fusion.A well organized center in a low-middle-income country can overcome the disadvantages of malnutrition and reduce abandonment. Outcomes remain suboptimal because of late diagnosis, early death, and a high relapse rate, which may have a partly genetic basis. Earlier diagnosis, better management of complications, and better knowledge of ALL will improve outcomes.

Transcripts of muscle-specific kinase (21-fold), acetylcholine receptor subunits α (68-fold), ε (threefold) and γ (47-fold), neural cell adhesion molecule (66-fold), and runt-related transcription factor 1 (33-fold) were upregulated in VO muscle of the rat, consistent with the marked persistent denervation evidenced by a large proportion of very small fibers (>20 %). In the Sarco mice, there were much smaller increases in denervation transcripts (0-3.5-fold) and accumulation of very small fibers (2-6 %) compared to the VO rat, suggesting a reduced capacity for reinnervation in aging muscle. Despite the marked persistent denervation in the VO rat muscle, transcripts of neurotrophins involved in promoting axonal sprouting following denervation exhibited no increase, and several miRNAs predicted to suppress neurotrophins were elevated in VO rat.Our results support the hypothesis that the accumulation of denervated fibers with aging is due to failed reinnervation and that this may be affected by a limited neurotrophin response that mediates axonal sprouting following denervation.((PMID:27573239))An appropriate inflammatory response plays critical roles in eliminating pathogens, whereas an excessive inflammatory response can cause tissue damage. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, plays critical roles in T cells; however, its roles in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammation in macrophages are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that upon TLR4 ligand stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages reduced the expression levels of RUNX1. Silencing of RUNX1 attenuated the LPS-induced IL-1β and IL-6 production levels, but the TNF-α levels were not affected. Overexpression of RUNX1 promoted IL-1β and IL-6 production in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-κB luciferase activity. Importantly, treatment with the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, protected mice from LPS-induced endotoxic shock and substantially reduced the IL-6 levels. These findings suggest that RUNX1 may be a new potential target for resolving TLR4-associated uncontrolled inflammation and preventing sepsis.((PMID:27492765))In our previous studies on the Iranian β-thalassemia (β-thal) patients, we identified an association between the severity of the β-thal phenotype and the polymorphic palindromic site at the 5' hypersensitive site 4-locus control region (5'HS4-LCR) of the β-globin gene cluster. Furthermore, a linkage disequilibrium was observed between this region and XmnI-HBG2 in the patient population. Based on this data, it was suggested that the well-recognized phenotype-ameliorating role assigned to positive XmnI could be associated with its linked elements in the LCR. To investigate the functional significance of polymorphisms at the 5'HS4-LCR, we studied its influence on binding of transcription factors. Web-based predictions of transcription factor binding revealed a binding site for runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), when the allele at the center of the palindrome (TGGGG(A/G)CCCCA) was A but not when it was G. Furthermore, electromobility shift assay (EMSA) presented evidence in support of allele-specific binding of RUNX1 to 5'HS4. Considering that RUNX1 is a well-known regulator of hematopoiesis, these preliminary data suggest the importance of further studies to confirm this interaction and consequently investigate its functional and phenotypical relevance. These studies could help us to understand the molecular mechanism behind the phenotype modifying role of the 5'HS4-LCR polymorphic palindromic region (rs16912979), which has been observed in previous studies.((PMID:27434586))Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs has recently been reported in tumorigenesis and plays a pivotal role in regulating malignant behavior of cancers. In this study, we confirmed that the long noncoding RNAs human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex P5 (HCP5) was up-regulated in glioma tissues as well as in U87 and U251 cells. Knockdown of HCP5 inhibited the malignant biological behavior of glioma cells by reducing proliferation, migration and invasion, and inducing apoptosis. HCP5 regulated the malignant behavior of glioma cells by binding to microRNA-139, which functions as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, knockdown of HCP5 down-regulated Runt-related transcription factor 1, a direct and functional downstream target of microRNA-139 that is involved in microRNA-139-mediated tumor-suppressive effects in glioma cells. Runt-related transcription factor 1 increased promoter activities and upregulated expression of the oncogenic gene astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Runt-related transcription factor 1 also increased the promoter activities and expression of HCP5, which showed a positive feedback loop in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the HCP5-microRNA-139- Runt-related transcription factor 1 feedback loop plays a pivotal role in regulating the malignant behavior of glioma cells, which may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for treating glioma.Molecular Therapy (2016); doi:10.1038/mt.2016.103.((PMID:27358895))Chromosomal abnormalities lead to the development of hematologic malignancies such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Known chromosomal changes causing MDS include deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1), and very rarely fusion genes involving RUNX1 at t(5;21)(q15;q22). We present a case of a 71-year-old female with MDS, refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1, with a combination of two cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically a concomitant translocation between chromosomes 5q15 and 21q22 and deletion of chromosome 5q13q33. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for RUNX1 (AML1), localized to 21q22, showed three FISH signals for RUNX1, consistent with rearrangement of RUNX1. Therapy was started with Lenalidomide leading to normal blood counts. Most significantly, repeat cytogenetics revealed normal karyotype and resolution of deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5 and a t(5;21). FISH negative for deletion 5q. The results altogether meet criteria for a complete cytogenetic remission (CR). We report a new case of t(5;21)(q15;q22) involving the RUNX1 gene and del(5)(q13q33) in a MDS patient, a combination of chromosomal abnormalities heretofore not reported in the literature. RUNX1 rearrangement is usually associated with an adverse prognosis in AML and MDS. Deletions of 5q are typically associated with poor prognosis in AML, however it is usually associated with a favorable prognosis in MDS. Our patient responded very well to Lenalidomide therapy with achievement of CR. Lenalidomide is approved for treatment of anemia in low and intermediate risk MDS with del (5q), however based on a search of literature it seems that RUNX1 mutations are also more prominent in patients who have responded to Lenalidomide therapy. MDS is a genomically unstable disease. Hence, it is conceivable that our patient started with a 5q minus syndrome and then acquired the second hit RUNX1 translocation leading to an accelerated phase of myeloid neoplasm or refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1. Hence, the temporal relationship between acquisition of del 5q and RUNX1 rearrangement may have influenced the clinical outcome and possibly response to therapy.((PMID:27358138))Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology. AAA is caused by segmental weakening of the aortic walls and progressive aortic dilation leading to the eventual rupture of the aorta, accompanied by intense inflammation. Additionally, studies have indicated a close relationship between the pathogenesis and progression of AAA and cellular immune responses in aneurysm wall tissue. The Runt-related genes (RUNX) encode multifunctional mediators of the of intracellular signal transduction pathways in vascular remodeling, endothelial function, immune response and inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of RUNX regulatory genes in AAA tissues and to assess the correlations between them. The study was performed on AAA wall-tissue samples obtained from patients with AAA during open aneurysm repair and normal aortic tissues collected from healthy organ donors. There are no proven clinical management strategies or pharmaco-therapeutics to prevent AAA progression once an AAA has been detected. Moreover, so far no biomarkers have been established to indicate the disease status of AAA. Hence, understanding the pathogenesis of AAA has recently become an increasing priority in basic and translational vascular research. We identified significantly higher mRNA and protein level of all of three Runt-related genes in aneurysmal aorta compared to a normal aorta. Increased expression of RUNX2 was demonstrated for the first time in abdominal aortic aneurysm tissue. Additionally, relationships between the activity of RUNX genes in the pathological tissue were identified. The results of elevated expression of RUNX genes and their relationships in the AAA tissues suggest the involvement of conserved Runt-related genes in the pathophysiology of AAA development.((PMID:27288310))Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, characterized by dysregulation of cellular immunity. Th17 and associated IL-17 were involved in the pathogenesis of ITP. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a member of the runt domain-containing family of transcription factors, is required for Th17 differentiation. Whether RUNX1 was involved in the pathogenesis of ITP remains poorly understood. In this study, 30 active ITP patients, 20 ITP in remission and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls were included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated to measure mRNA level of RUNX1 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) by quantitative real-time PCR and Th17 cells by flow cytometry. Meanwhile, plasma was extracted for measurement of IL-17 level by ELISA. Our results showed a significantly higher expression of RUNX1, RORγt, Th17 cells and plasma level of IL-17 in active ITP patients than that in healthy controls. No differences of expression of RUNX1, RORγt and Th17 cells were observed between remission patients and controls. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation of RUNX1 with RORγt was found in active ITP patients. In conclusion, RUNX1 was associated with the pathogenesis of ITP possibly through regulation of Th17 cell differentiation and therapeutically targeting it might be a novel approach in ITP treatment.((PMID:27267711))Runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, is expressed in preosteoclasts. Previously we evaluated the bone phenotype of CD11b-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice and demonstrated enhanced osteoclasts and decreased bone mass in males. However, an assessment of the effects of Runx1 deletion in female osteoclast precursors was impossible with this model. Moreover, the role of Runx1 in myeloid cell differentiation into other lineages is unknown. Therefore, we generated LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice, which delete Runx1 equally (∼80% deletion) in myeloid precursor cells from both sexes and examined the capacity of these cells to differentiate into osteoclasts and phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells. Both female and male LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice had decreased trabecular bone mass (72% decrease in bone volume fraction) and increased osteoclast number (2-3 times) (P < .05) without alteration of osteoblast histomorphometric indices. We also demonstrated that loss of Runx1 in pluripotential myeloid precursors with LysM-Cre did not alter the number of myeloid precursor cells in bone marrow or their ability to differentiate into phagocytizing or antigen-presenting cells. This study demonstrates that abrogation of Runx1 in multipotential myeloid precursor cells significantly and specifically enhanced the ability of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand to stimulate osteoclast formation and fusion in female and male mice without affecting other myeloid cell fates. In turn, increased osteoclast activity in LysM-Cre Runx1(fl/fl) mice likely contributed to a decrease in bone mass. These dramatic effects were not due to increased osteoclast precursors in the deleted mutants and argue that inhibition of Runx1 in multipotential myeloid precursor cells is important for osteoclast formation and function.((PMID:27164167))Cell fate of lower Müllerian duct epithelium (MDE), to become uterine or vaginal epithelium, is determined by the absence or presence of ΔNp63 expression, respectively. Previously, we showed that SMAD4 and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) were independently required for MDE to express ΔNp63. Here, we report that vaginal mesenchyme directs vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE through paracrine activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-MAPK pathway. In the developing reproductive tract, FGF7 and FGF10 were enriched in vaginal mesenchyme, whereas FGF receptor 2IIIb was expressed in epithelia of both the uterus and vagina. When Fgfr2 was inactivated, vaginal MDE underwent uterine cell fate, and this differentiation defect was corrected by activation of MEK-ERK pathway. In vitro, FGF10 in combination with bone morphogenetic protein 4 and activin A (ActA) was sufficient to induce ΔNp63 in MDE, and ActA was essential for induction of RUNX1 through SMAD-independent pathways. Accordingly, inhibition of type 1 receptors for activin in neonatal mice induced uterine differentiation in vaginal epithelium by down-regulating RUNX1, whereas conditional deletion of Smad2 and Smad3 had no effect on vaginal epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE is induced by FGF7/10-MAPK, bone morphogenetic protein 4-SMAD, and ActA-RUNX1 pathway activities, and the disruption in any one of these pathways results in conversion from vaginal to uterine epithelial cell fate.((PMID:27150991))To explore the application of combined detection of fusion gene and BIOMED-2 standardized immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement system in diagnosis and treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Multiplex-PCR amplifications and RQ-PCR of RNA/DNA were performed using ALL fusion gene detection kit and BIOMED-2 primer. The Ig gene rearrangements were analyzed by using PCR fragment analysis system.Out of 251 children with B-ALL, 77 cases were TEL-AML1(+) , 28 cases were E2A-PBX1(+) , 10 cases were MLL-AF4(+) , 11 cases were BCR-ABL(+) , the total positive rate was 50.2%, 82.5% showed IgH VH-JH rearrangement, 53.4% showed IgK rearrangement. The positive rate of combined detection of fusion gene and gene rearrangement was 99%. E2A-PBX1(+) and MLL-AF4(+) with IgK(+) gene rearrangement group was compared with negative control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001 or P = 0.005); 105 ALL fusion gene positive cases had been detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) simultaneously, the accordance rate of fusion gene and FISH was more than 94%.The combined detection of ALL fusion gene and BIOMED-2 standardized clonality analysis system can improve the positive detected rate of B-ALL dramatically, and make the grouping of disease prognosis more accurately; this combined detection is a more faster and sensitive method than FISH.((PMID:27112265))Less than 50 patients with FPD/AML (OMIM 601309) have been reported as of today and there may an underestimation. The purpose of this study was to describe the natural history, the haematological features and the genotype-phenotype correlations of this entity in order to, first, screen it better and earlier, before leukaemia occurrence and secondly to optimize appropriate monitoring and treatment, in particular when familial stem cell transplantation is considered.We have investigated 41 carriers of RUNX1 alteration belonging to nine unrelated French families with FPD/AML and two syndromic patients, registered in the French network on rare platelet disorders from 2005 to 2015.Five missense, one non-sense, three frameshift mutations and two large deletions involving several genes including RUNX1 were evidenced. The history of familial leukaemia was suggestive of FPD/AML in seven pedigrees, whereas an autosomal dominant pattern of lifelong thrombocytopenia was the clinical presentation of two. Additional syndromic features characterized two large sporadic deletions. Bleeding tendency was mild and thrombocytopenia moderate (>50 x10(9)/L), with normal platelet volume. A functional platelet defect consistent with a δ-granule release defect was found in ten patients regardless of the type of RUNX1 alteration. The incidence of haematological malignancies was higher when the mutated RUNX1 allele was likely to cause a dominant negative effect (19/34) in comparison with loss of function alleles (3/9). A normal platelet count does not rule out the diagnosis of FPD/AML, since the platelet count was found normal for three mutated subjects, a feature that has a direct impact in the search for a related donor in case of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Platelet dysfunction suggestive of defective δ-granule release could be of values for the diagnosis of FPD/AML particularly when the clinical presentation is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size in the absence of familial malignancies. The genotype-phenotype correlations might be helpful in genetic counselling and appropriate optimal therapeutic management.((PMID:27054428))The study shows how the influence of titanium surfaces on human mesenchymal stem cells differentiates toward osteocytes lineage and how, after growth, on machined titanium disk or etched titanium disk, changes, in gene expression for RUNX1, CTNNB1, SP7, and DLX5.Genes were analyzed by means of quantitative real-time polimerase chain reaction. Osseo genic lineage differentiation was also tested by means of the catenin-β1 immunofluorescence, induced osteoblasts, which represented the internal control.The RUNX1 and SP7 expressions in the induced osteoblasts prove to be different, compared with cells cultured on metallic supports. Moreover, the levels of expression of the runt-related transcription factor 1 and the osterix appeared more down-regulated in cells that grew on a machined titanium surface. In the present experimental model, mRNA expression of DLX5 and CTNNB1 in human mesenchymal stem cells, cultured on each of the titanium surfaces, showed no differences, compared with osteoblast-induced cells. The immunofluorescence scores, for protein expression of beta-catenin in human mesenchymal stem cell treated cells, illustrates significantly improved results with the etched surface.Present results suggested that different titanium surfaces might induce some differences in terms of gene expression. The only gene analyzed, which proved significant differences between the 2 titanium supports, was SP7; however, the other 3 genes indicating the existence of differences between the 2 titanium groups.((PMID:27014980))To evaluate the safety and efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors T cells (CAR-T) in childhood acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).A relapsed B-ALL child after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was treated with CAR-T, and the related literatures were reviewed.An 11-year-old girl with TEL-AML1 fusion gene positive BALL who suffered a bone marrow relapse 28 months after remission from conventional chemotherapy. During the second remission, the patient received haploidentical allo-HSCT. She relapsed with detectable TEL-AML1 fusion gene even after chemotherapy and donor leukocyte infusions. She received an experimental donor-derived fourth generation CD19 CAR-T therapy. After infusion of 1 × 10(6)/kg CAR-T cells, she experienced only mild or moderate cytokine-release syndrome and the minimal residual disease turned negative. Then three maintenance of CAR-T cell infusions [(0.83-1.65)×10(6)/kg] was administered, and the disease-free survival had lasted for 10 months. However, the TEL-AML1 copies in her blood still increased and she died with leukemia relapse after additional CAR-T cell infusion.Treatment of relapsed B-ALL with the fourth generation CAR-T cells directed against CD19 was effective and safe. CAR-T therapy is a novel therapeutic approach that could be useful for patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL who have failed all other treatment options.((PMID:26994850))Homoharringtonine combined aclarubicin and cytarabine (HAA) has been demonstrated to achieve a high remission rate and provide a survival advantage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate whether HAA is an ideal induction regimen for t(8;21)AML, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 140 patients from the last 8 years in our center. When achieving complete remission (CR), the post-remission treatment was administered as a minimal residual disease-directed risk-stratification treatment protocol. The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was assessed by RT-qPCR. The last follow-up was conducted in October 2015. In total, thirty patients received an HAA regimen as the induction treatment. The CR rate after one cycle of the HAA regimen was 93.3% (28/30). One patient achieved partial remission, and one had no response. No patients died during induction treatment. The median fold decrease of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 transcript level was 200 (1-358000), and 16.7% (5/30) patients achieved >3 log decrease after one cycle of the HAA regimen. The estimated 4-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 89.9% and 90.8%, respectively. We concluded that the HAA regimen is highly effective as the first course of induction therapy for t(8;21) AML, and this needs to be confirmed in a large population in the future.((PMID:26990877))A network of lineage-specific transcription factors and microRNAs tightly regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells along the distinct lineages. Deregulation of this regulatory network contributes to impaired lineage fidelity and leukemogenesis. We found that the hematopoietic master regulator RUNX1 controls the expression of certain microRNAs, of importance during erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation. In particular, we show that the erythorid miR144/451 cluster is epigenetically repressed by RUNX1 during megakaryopoiesis. Furthermore, the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion protein transcriptionally represses the miR144/451 pre-microRNA. Thus RUNX1/ETO contributes to increased expression of miR451 target genes and interferes with normal gene expression during differentiation. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of RUNX1/ETO in Kasumi1 cells and in RUNX1/ETO positive primary acute myeloid leukemia patient samples leads to up-regulation of miR144/451. RUNX1 thus emerges as a key regulator of a microRNA network, driving differentiation at the megakaryocytic/erythroid branching point. The network is disturbed by the leukemogenic RUNX1/ETO fusion product.((PMID:26907657))RUNX1 (AML1) amplification in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has been associated with poor survival for unclear reasons. Our anecdotal experience suggests that children with B-ALL and RUNX1 amplification might be predisposed to thrombosis.We performed a retrospective cohort study of children with B-ALL treated from 2008 to 2014 at the North Carolina Children's Hospital. Patient demographics, cytogenetics, and diagnosis of thrombosis were extracted by blinded chart review. Analysis was performed examining the relationship between RUNX1 amplification and thrombosis.We identified 119 patients with B-ALL and a median age of 4.9 years (interquartile range, 2.9 to 8.6 y) at diagnosis. Four patients (3%) had RUNX1 amplification. The average number of RUNX1 copies among those with amplification was 5 (SD 0.81 [range, 4 to 6]). Eighteen thromboses were diagnosed within 6 months of starting treatment. These events were more likely among patients with RUNX1 amplification than in patients without amplification (75% vs. 13%; RR 5.75, 95% confidence interval, 2.75-12.01).RUNX1 amplification may predispose to early thrombotic events in children with B-ALL which could, in part, contribute to their poorer outcomes. Treatment implications, including possible prophylactic anticoagulation of patients with of RUNX1 amplification, justify larger studies to confirm these findings.((PMID:26901859))RUNX1 a member of the family of runt related transcription factors (RUNX), is essential for hematopoiesis. The expression of RUNX1 gene is controlled by two promoters; the distal P1 promoter and the proximal P2 promoter. Several isoforms of RUNX1 mRNA are generated through the use of both promoters and alternative splicing. These isoforms not only differs in their temporal expression pattern but also exhibit differences in tissue specificity. The RUNX1 isoforms derived from P2 are expressed in a variety of tissues, but expression of P1-derived isoform is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineage. However, the control of hematopoietic-cell specific expression is poorly understood. Here we report regulation of P1-derived RUNX1 mRNA by RUNX1 protein. In silico analysis of P1 promoter revealed presence of two evolutionary conserved RUNX motifs, 0.6kb upstream of the transcription start site, and three RUNX motifs within 170bp of the 5'UTR. Transcriptional contribution of these RUNX motifs was studied in myeloid and T-cells. RUNX1 genomic fragment containing all sites show very low basal activity in both cell types. Mutation or deletion of RUNX motifs in the UTR enhances basal activity of the RUNX1 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that RUNX1 protein is recruited to these sites. Overexpression of RUNX1 in non-hematopoietic cells results in a dose dependent activation of the RUNX1 P1 promoter. We also demonstrate that RUNX1 protein regulates transcription of endogenous RUNX1 mRNA in T-cell. Finally we show that SCL transcription factor is recruited to regions containing RUNX motifs in the promoter and the UTR and regulates activity of the RUNX1 P1 promoter in vitro. Thus, multiple lines of evidence show that RUNX1 protein regulates its own gene transcription.((PMID:27698447))((PMID:27694501))((PMID:27673579))Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with t(8;21) aberration often have favorable outcomes, however, relapse still occurs in 30%-40% patients, with only 50%-60% of patients with t(8;21) AML cured with regimens containing high-dose cytarabine (HD-Ara-C). To evaluate the effects of fludarabine and cytarabine (FA) consolidation therapy for t(8;21) AML patients, a prospective randomized study was performed. A total of 45 patients with t(8;21) AML after achieving complete remission (CR) were randomly assigned to receive four course consolidation with FA (n=23) or HD-Ara-C (n=22). Our study showed that at 36-months, relapse-free survival (RFS) was 81.73% in the FA arm and 50.73% in the HD-Ara-C arm (P=0.04), overall survival (OS) was 91.1% and 48.4% (P=0.01) in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively; whereas cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 18.27% and 47.39%, in the FA arm and in the HD-Ara-C arm respectively (P=0.05). In our study, treatment with FA, MRD2 status (reduction ≥ 3-log) and absence of c-kit mutations were identified as independent prognostic factors for lower risk of relapse, improved RFS and OS. We also found RFS for patients without c-kit mutations was 100% in FA arm, and 57.8% in HD-Ara-C arm at 36 months (P=0.005); OS of both groups at 36 months was 100% and 51.4%, respectively (P=0.004), suggesting a benefit of consolidation therapy with FA for t(8;21) AML patients, especially, those without c-kit mutations (Clinicaltrials.org ID NCT# 02024308).

Runx genes regulate development and their products are transcription factors associated with cancer development. A Runx1 enhancer element, eR1 is a marker of hematopoietic stem cells. We studied expression from eR1 in stomach and the roles of gastric stem cells in gastric carcinogenesis in transgenic mice.We used in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses to study expression of Runx1 in gastric tissues from C57BL/6 (control) mice. We then created mice that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or CreERT2 under the control of eR1 (eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-tdTomato, eR1-CreERT2;Rosa-LSL-EYFP mice). Gastric tissues were collected and lineage-tracing experiments were performed. Gastric organoids were cultured from eR1-CreERT2(5-2);Rosa-LSL-tdTomato mice and immunofluorescence analyses were performed. We investigated the effects of expressing oncogenic mutations in stem cells under control of eR1 using eR1-CreERT2;LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice; gastric tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence.Most proliferation occurred in the isthmus; 86% of proliferating cells were RUNX1 positive and 76% were MUC5AC positive. In eR1-EGFP mice, EGFP signals were mainly detected in the upper part of the gastric unit, and 83% of EGFP-positive cells were located in the isthmus/pit region. We found that eR1 marked undifferentiated stem cells in the isthmus and a smaller number of terminally differentiated chief cells at the base. eR1 also marked cells in the pyloric gland in the antrum. Lineage tracing experiments demonstrated that stem cells in the isthmus and antrum continuously gave rise to mature cells to maintain the gastric unit. eR1-positive cells in the isthmus and pyloric gland generated organoid cultures in vitro. In eR1-CreERT2;LSL-Kras G12D/+ mice, MUC5AC-positive cells rapidly differentiated from stem cells in the isthmus, resulting in distinct metaplastic lesions similar to that observed in human gastric atrophy.Using lineage tracing experiments in mice, we found that a Runx1 enhancer element, eR1, promotes its expression in the isthmus stem cells of stomach corpus as well; as pyloric gland in the antrum. We were able to use eR1 to express oncogenic mutations; in gastric stem cells, proving a new model for studies of gastric carcinogenesis.((PMID:27667480))Down syndrome (DS) is the most common birth defect in children. To investigate the mechanisms of DS, the present study analyzed the bisulfite‑sequencing (seq) data GSE42144, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. GSE42144 included DNA methylation data of three DS samples and three control samples, and RNA‑seq data of two DS samples and five control samples. The methylated sites in the bisulfite‑seq data were detected using Bismark and Bowtie2. The BiSeq tool was applied to determine differentially methylated regions and to identify adjacent genes. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, the functions of the abnormal demethylated genes were predicted by functional enrichment analyses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then screened using a paired t‑test. Furthermore, the interactions of the proteins encoded by selected genes were determined using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Cytoscape. A total of 74 CpG regions showed significant differential DNA methylation between the DS and normal samples. There were five abnormal demethylated DNA regions in chromosome 21. In the DS samples, a total of 43 adjacent genes were identified with demethylation in their promoter regions and one adjacent gene was identified with upregulated methylation in its promoter regions. In addition, 584 upregulated genes were identified, including 24 genes with transcriptional regulatory function. In particular, upregulated Runt‑related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was located on chromosome 21. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) was involved in neuronal differentiation and transcriptional suppression. In the PPI network, genes may be involved in DS by interacting with others, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2)‑early growth response (EGR)2 and NR4A2‑EGR3. Therefore, RUNX1, NR4A2, EGR2, EGR3 and ID4 may be key genes associated with the pathogenesis of DS.((PMID:27664585))The t(12;21)(p13;q22) with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion occurs in 25% of cases of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL); and is generally associated with favorable prognosis. However, 15-20% of the t(12;21)-positive cases are associated with high-risk disease due to for example slow early responses to therapy. It is well-known that development of overt leukemia in t(12;21)-positive ALL requires secondary chromosomal aberrations although the full spectrum of these cytogenetic alterations is yet unsettled, and also, how they may be associated with disease outcome. This report describes the case of an adolescent male with t(12;21)-positive ALL who displayed a G-banded karyotype initially interpreted as del(1)(p22p13) and del(15)(q15). The patient was treated according to NOPHO standard risk protocol at diagnosis, but had minimal residual disease (MRD) at 6,4% on day 29 as determined by flowcytometric immunophenotyping. Because of MRD level>0.1% he was then assigned as a high risk patient and received intensified chemotherapy accordingly. Further molecular cytogenetic studies and oligo-based aCGH (oaCGH) analysis characterized the acquired complex structural rearrangements on chromosomes 1 and 15, which can be described as der(1)del(1)(p13.1p31.1)t(1;15)(q42;q15) with concurrent deletions at 1q31.2-q31.3, 1q42.12-q43, and 15q15.1-q15.3. The unbalanced complex rearrangements have not been described previously. Extended locus-specific FISH analyses showed that the three deletions were on the same chromosome 1 homologue that was involved in the t(1;15), and that the deletion on chromosome 15 also was on the same chromosome 15 homologue as involved in the t(1;15). Together these findings show the great importance of the combined usage of molecular cytogenetic analyses and oaCGH analysis to enhance characterization of apparently simple G-banded karyotypes, and to provide a more complete spectrum of secondary chromosomal aberrations in high risk t(12;21)-positive BCP-ALLs.((PMID:27650541))Overwhelming evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their role in the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL, one of the most frequent subtypes of pediatric leukemia. First, we used primary leukemia patient samples to identify an ETV6/RUNX1 specific expression signature consisting of 596 lncRNA transcripts. Next, integration of this lncRNA signature with RNA sequencing of BCP-ALL cell lines and lncRNA profiling of an in vitro model system of ETV6/RUNX1 knockdown, revealed that lnc-NKX2-3-1, lnc-TIMM21-5, lnc-ASTN1-1 and lnc-RTN4R-1 are truly regulated by the oncogenic fusion protein. Moreover, sustained inactivation of lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cells caused profound changes in gene expression. All together, our study defined a unique lncRNA expression signature associated with ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL and identified lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 as lncRNAs that might be functionally implicated in the biology of this prevalent subtype of human leukemia.((PMID:27637333))Transcription factors of the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-family are essential for antigen-specific T cell activation and differentiation. Their cooperative DNA binding with other transcription factors, such as AP1-proteins (FOS, JUN, JUNB), FOXP3, IRFs and EGR1, dictate the gene regulatory action of NFATs. To identify as yet unknown interaction partners of NFAT, we purified biotin tagged NFATc1/αA, NFATc1/βC and NFATc2/C protein-complexes and analyzed their components by SILAC-based mass spectrometry. We revealed more than 170 NFAT associated proteins, half of which are involved in transcriptional regulation. Among them are known, as well as many unknown interaction partners of NFATc1 and NFATc2 in T cells, such as Raptor, CHEK1, CREB1, RUNX1, SATB1, Ikaros and Helios. The association of NFATc2 with several other transcription factors is DNA-dependent, indicating cooperative DNA binding. Moreover, our computational analysis discovered that binding motifs for RUNX and CREB1 are found preferentially in the direct vicinity of NFAT binding motifs and in a distinct orientation to them. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mTOR and CHEK1 kinase activity influence NFAT's transcriptional potency. Finally, our dataset of NFAT-associated proteins provides a good basis to further study NFAT's diverse functions and how these are modulated due to the interplay of multiple interaction partners.((PMID:27634876))While decades of research have identified molecular pathways inducing and promoting stages of prostate cancer malignancy, studies addressing dynamic changes of cancer-related regulatory factors in a prostate tumor progression model are limited. Using the TRAMP mouse model of human prostate cancer, we address mechanisms of deregulation for the cancer-associated transcription factors, Runx1 and Runx2 by identifying microRNAs with reciprocal expression changes at six time points during 33 weeks of tumorigenesis. We molecularly define transition stages from PIN lesions to hyperplasia/neoplasia and progression to adenocarcinoma by temporal changes in expression of human prostate cancer markers, including the androgen receptor and tumor suppressors, Nkx3.1 and PTEN. Concomitant activation of PTEN, AR, and Runx factors occurs at early stages. At late stages, PTEN and AR are downregulated, while Runx1 and Runx2 remain elevated. Loss of Runx-targeting microRNAs, miR-23b-5p, miR-139-5p, miR-205-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-382-5p, and miR-384-5p, contribute to aberrant Runx expression in prostate tumors. Our studies reveal a Runx/miRNA interaction axis centered on PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling. This regulatory network translates to mechanistic understanding of prostate tumorigenesis that can be developed for diagnosis and directed therapy.((PMID:27620872))Around 20-25 % of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias carry the ETV6-RUNX1 (E/R) fusion gene - a fusion of two central hematopoietic transcription factors, ETV6 (TEL) and RUNX1 (AML1). Despite its prevalence, the exact genomic targets of E/R have remained elusive. We evaluated gene loci and enhancers targeted by E/R genome-wide in precursor B acute leukemia cells using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq). We show that expression of the E/R fusion leads to widespread repression of RUNX1-motif containing enhancers at its target gene loci. Moreover, multiple super-enhancers from CD19/CD20-lineage were repressed implicating a role in impediment of lineage commitment. In effect, the expression of several genes involved in B cell signaling and adhesion was downregulated, and the repression depended on the wild-type DNA-binding Runt domain of RUNX1. We also identified a number of E/R-regulated annotated and de novo noncoding genes. The results provide a comprehensive genome-wide mapping between E/R-regulated key regulatory elements and genes in precursor B cell leukemia that disrupt normal B lymphopoiesis.((PMID:27618722))Down syndrome (DS) is the leading genetic cause of mental retardation and is caused by a third copy of human chromosome 21. The different pathologies of DS involve many tissues with a distinct array of neural phenotypes. Here we characterize embryonic stem cell lines with DS (DS-ESCs), and focus on the neural aspects of the disease. Our results show that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from five independent DS-ESC lines display increased apoptosis and downregulation of forehead developmental genes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested RUNX1 as a key transcription regulator in DS-NPCs. Using genome editing we were able to disrupt all three copies of RUNX1 in DS-ESCs, leading to downregulation of several RUNX1 target developmental genes accompanied by reduced apoptosis and neuron migration. Our work sheds light on the role of RUNX1 and the importance of dosage balance in the development of neural phenotypes in DS.((PMID:27617577))Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its candidacy as a therapeutic target has been evaluated. Gal-3 is widely upregulated in tumors, and its expression is associated with the development and malignancy of PDAC. In the present study, we demonstrate that a polysaccharide, RN1, purified from the flower of Panax notoginseng binds to Gal-3 and suppresses its expression. In addition, RN1 markedly inhibits PDAC cells growth in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, RN1 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gal-3, thereby disrupting the interaction between Gal-3 and EGFR and downregulating extracellular-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and the transcription factor of Gal-3, Runx1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of Runx1 by RN1, suppresses Gal-3 expression and inactivates Gal-3-associated signaling pathways, including the EGFR/ERK/Runx1, BMP/smad/Id-3 and integrin/FAK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, RN1 can also bind to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2) and block the interaction between Gal-3 and the BMPRs. Thus, our results suggest that a novel Gal-3 inhibitor RN1 may be a potential candidate for human PDAC treatment via multiple targets and multiple signaling pathways.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 September 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.306.((PMID:27611867))Precursor-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling represents a crucial checkpoint at the pre-B cell stage. Aberrant pre-BCR signaling is considered as a key factor for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) development. BCP-ALL are believed to be arrested at the pre-BCR checkpoint independent of pre-BCR expression. However, the cellular stage at which BCP-ALL are arrested and whether this relates to expression of the pre-BCR components (IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1) is still unclear. Here, we show differential protein expression and copy number variation (CNV) patterns of the pre-BCR components in pediatric BCP-ALL. Moreover, analyzing six BCP-ALL data sets (n = 733), we demonstrate that TCF3-PBX1 ALL express high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1, and are arrested at the pre-B stage. By contrast, ETV6-RUNX1 ALL express low levels of IGHM or VPREB1, and are arrested at the pro-B stage. Irrespective of subtype, ALL with high levels of IGHM, IGLL1 and VPREB1 are arrested at the pre-B stage and correlate with good prognosis in high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL (n = 207). Our findings suggest that BCP-ALL are arrested at different cellular stages, which relates to the expression pattern of the pre-BCR components that could serve as prognostic markers for high-risk pediatric BCP-ALL patients.((PMID:27601546))The genetic basis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is heterogeneous, and various combinations of somatic mutations are associated with different clinical phenotypes and outcomes. Whether the genetic basis of MDS influences the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is unclear.We studied 401 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from MDS (MDS/AML). We used massively parallel sequencing to examine tumor samples collected before HSCT for somatic mutations in 34 recurrently mutated genes in myeloid neoplasms. We then analyzed the impact of mutations on the outcome of HSCT.Overall, 87% of patients carried one or more oncogenic mutations. Somatic mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 were independent predictors of relapse and overall survival after HSCT in both patients with MDS and patients with MDS/AML (P values ranging from .003 to .035). In patients with MDS/AML, gene ontology (ie, secondary-type AML carrying mutations in genes of RNA splicing machinery, TP53-mutated AML, or de novo AML) was an independent predictor of posttransplantation outcome (P = .013). The impact of ASXL1, RUNX1, and TP53 mutations on posttransplantation survival was independent of the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Combining somatic mutations and IPSS-R risk improved the ability to stratify patients by capturing more prognostic information at an individual level. Accounting for various combinations of IPSS-R risk and somatic mutations, the 5-year probability of survival after HSCT ranged from 0% to 73%.Somatic mutation in ASXL1, RUNX1, or TP53 is independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after allogeneic HSCT for patients with MDS and MDS/AML. Accounting for these genetic lesions may improve the prognostication precision in clinical practice and in designing clinical trials.((PMID:27599428))Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are not only a valuable resource for regenerative medicine, but also a promising tool for disease modeling and drug discovery. Patient-specific iPSCs harboring disease-specific mutations are extremely useful for investigating disease mechanisms and novel treatment approaches. In the field of hematology, attempts to establish iPSCs from tumor cells such as those of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were largely unsuccessful because proper reprogramming processes were hampered by their extensive genetic alterations. In contrast, congenital disorders caused by a single genetic mutation are ideal candidates for deriving iPSCs. We have been investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying leukemia and MDS by implementing iPSC technology. Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a high propensity for developing acute leukemia, which is caused by heterozygous mutation of RUNX1. We have successfully established iPSCs from three distinct FPD pedigrees and examined the responsible defect during hematopoietic development. This system will serve as a novel unprecedented platform for prospectively studying hematologic disorders using human cells.((PMID:27591551))A novel role for phenotypic transcription factors in very early differentiation was recently observed and merits further study to elucidate what role this precocious expression may have in development. The RUNX1 transcription factor exhibits selective and transient upregulation during early mesenchymal differentiation. In contrast to phenotype-associated transcriptional control of gene expression to establish and sustain hematopoietic/myeloid lineage identity, precocious expression of RUNX1 is functionally linked to control of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition that is obligatory for development. This early RUNX1 expression spike provides a paradigm for precocious expression of a phenotypic transcription factor that invites detailed mechanistic study to fully understand its biological importance.

We have previously shown that inactivation of Dnmt3a in hematopoietic cells results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in mice. Here we show that 12% of Dnmt3a-deficient mice develop CD8+ mature peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) and 29% of mice are affected by both diseases. 10% of Dnmt3a+/- mice develop lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in PTCL. DNA methylation was deregulated genome-wide with 10-fold more hypo- than hypermethylated promoters and enhancers, demonstrating that hypomethylation is a major event in the development of PTCL. Hypomethylated promoters were enriched for binding sites of transcription factors AML1, NF-κB and OCT1, implying the transcription factors potential involvement in Dnmt3a-associated methylation. Whereas 71 hypomethylated genes showed an increased expression in PTCL, only 3 hypermethylated genes were silenced, suggesting that cancer-specific hypomethylation has broader effects on the transcriptome of cancer cells than hypermethylation. Interestingly, transcriptomes of Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ lymphomas were largely conserved and significantly overlapped with those of human tumors. Importantly, we observed downregulation of tumor suppressor p53 in Dnmt3a+/- and Dnmt3aΔ/Δ lymphomas as well as in pre-tumor thymocytes from 9 months old but not 6 weeks old Dnmt3a+/- tumor-free mice, suggesting that p53 downregulation is chronologically an intermediate event in tumorigenesis. Decrease in p53 is likely an important event in tumorigenesis because its overexpression inhibited proliferation in mouse PTCL cell lines, suggesting that low levels of p53 are important for tumor maintenance. Altogether, our data link the haploinsufficient tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3a in the prevention of mouse mature CD8+ PTCL indirectly to a bona fide tumor suppressor of T cell malignancies p53.((PMID:27587249))To investigate frequency and clinical features of additional sex combs-like 2 (ASXL2) gene mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene and to analyze the relationship between ASXL2 gene mutation and c- kit gene mutation.Mutation analysis of exon 11 and 12 of ASXL2 gene in 59 de novo AML patients was performed by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The clinical features, survival curve and c-kit gene mutation in ASXL2 gene mutation positive and negative patients were compared.In a total of 59 AML patients with AML1-ETO fusion gene positive, 11.9% (7/59) patients harboured ASXL2 gene mutations. The hemoglobin levels of patients with mutated ASXL2 gene [56.2 (38.0- 72.0) g/L] were significantly lower than those with wild type ASXL2 [69.0(37.2-154.0) g/L] (P=0.038). Differences were not observed in white blood cell counts, platelet counts, the proportion of acidophilic cell, and the proportion of primitive cell in the marrow between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). None of all 59 patients suffered from liver, spleen, central nervous system metastases in both groups. Moreover, enlarged lymph nodes was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.859). Immunophenotypic analysis: in positive group CD33 positive expression was significantly lower than that of negative group (P=0.033). cCD3 was not expressed in both groups. Expression levels of CD117, cMPO, HLA-DR, CD34, CD38, CD13, CD44, CD15, CD64, CD11b, CD56, CD19, cCD79a and CD7 were similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P>0.05). All of 59 patients were in remission (P=0.577). Overall survival was similar between patients with mutant ASXL2 and ones without mutant ASXL2 (P=0.631). The mutation rates of c- kit in positive group and negative group were 14.3% and 29.4%, without statistical significance (P= 0.697).ASXL2 mutation may be a new event that can cooperate with AML1-ETO to induce leukemia. Patients in AML1- ETO positive AML with ASXL2 mutation show specific clinical characteristics of hemoglobin levels and expression level of CD33. ASXL2 gene mutations and c-kit gene mutations may not have a specific correlation between them.((PMID:27576335))Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) sequences make up ~8% of the human genome and increased expression of some HERV proteins has been observed in various pathologies including leukaemia and multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the function of these HERV proteins or environmental factors which regulate their expression. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used very extensively as antimicrobials and antivirals in numerous consumer products although their effect on the expression of HERV gene products is unknown. Cell proliferation and cell toxicity assays were carried out on human acute T lymphoblastic leukaemia (MOLT-4) and Fanconi anaemia associated acute myeloid leukaemia (FA-AML1) cells treated with two different sizes of AgNPs (7nm and 50nm diameter). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were then used to the assess expression of HERV-W syncytin-1 mRNA and protein in these cells. FA-AML1 cells were more sensitive overall than MOLT-4 to treatment with the smaller 7nm sized AgNp's being the most toxic in these cells. MOLT-4 cell were more resistant and showed no evidence of differential toxicity to the different sized particles. Syncytin-1 mRNA and protein were induced by both 7 and 50nm AgNPs in both cell types yet with different kinetics. In summary, the observation that AgNPs induce expression of syncytin-1 in FA-AML1 and MOLT-4 cells at doses as little as 5 µg/ml is grounds for concern since this protein is up-regulated in both malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. Considering the widespread use of AgNPs in the environment it is clear that their ability to induce syncytin-1 should be investigated further in other cell types.((PMID:27554046))Histone deacetylases (HDACs) critically regulate gene expression by determining the acetylation status of histones. In addition, studies have increasingly focused on the activities of HDACs, especially involving non-histone proteins, and their various biological effects. Aberrant HDAC expression observed in several kinds of human tumors makes HDACs potential targets for cancer treatment. Several preclinical studies have suggested that HDAC inhibitors exhibit some efficacy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with AML1-ETO, which mediates transcriptional repression through its interaction with a complex including HDAC1. Recurrent mutations in epigenetic regulators are found in T-cell lymphomas (TCLs), and HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents were shown to act cooperatively in the treatment of TCLs. Preclinical modeling has suggested that persistent activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway could serve as a useful biomarker of resistance to HDAC inhibitor in patients with cutaneous TCL. Panobinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, has achieved longer progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) than the placebo in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Panobinostat inhibited MM cell growth by degrading protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit α (PPP3CA), a catalytic subunit of calcineurin. This degradation was suggested to be mediated by the blockade of the chaperone function of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) due to HDAC6 inhibition. Aberrant PPP3CA expression in advanced MM indicated a possible correlation between high PPP3CA expression and the pathogenesis of MM. Furthermore, PPP3CA was suggested as a common target of panobinostat and bortezomib. This article is protected by copyright.

A frequent concomitant event is the loss of the residual ETV6 allele suggesting a critical role for the ETV6 transcriptional repressor in the etiology of this cancer. However, the precise mechanism through which loss of functional ETV6 contributes to disease pathogenesis is still unclear. To investigate the impact of ETV6 loss on the transcriptional network and to identify new transcriptional targets of ETV6, we used whole transcriptome analysis of both pre-B leukemic cell lines and patients combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation. Using this integrative approach, we identified 4 novel direct ETV6 target genes: CLIC5, BIRC7, ANGPTL2 and WBP1L. To further evaluate the role of chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC5 in leukemogenesis, we generated cell lines overexpressing CLIC5 and demonstrated an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. We further described the implications of CLIC5's ion channel activity in lysosomal-mediated cell death, possibly by modulating the function of transferrin receptor with which it co-localizes intracellularly. For the first time, we showed that loss of ETV6 leads to significant overexpression of CLIC5, which in turn leads to decreased lysosome-mediated apoptosis. Our data suggest that heightened CLIC5 activity could promote a permissive environment for oxidative-stress induced DNA damage accumulation and thereby contribute to leukemogenesis.((PMID:27531762))To analyse the clinical features and prognostic significance of cross-lineage antigen expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML) in order to establish individualized treatment for a better outcome and prognosis.A total of 227 cases (exduding M3) were detected by flow cytometry for immune phenotype. The CD7(-)CD56(-)CD19(-) AML served as control. The clinical features, treatment response and prognosis of CD7(+) group, CD56(+) group and CD19(+) group were compared.The detection rate of CD56(+),CD7(+) and CD19(+) in AML was 15.9%, 25.1% and 11.0%, respectively. There were no differences between CD56(+) AML, CD7(+) AML, CD19(+) AML, and CD56(-)CD7(-)CD19(-) AML in the proportion of blast cells, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count and MDS transformed AML rate. The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD56(+) AML patients were lower than those in the control group (20.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.0099; 73.3% vs 87.5%, P=0.04). The median time of CR in CD56(+) AML was longer than that in the control group (118 days vs 46 days, P=0.04). The PFS time and OS time of CD56(+) AML were shorter than those in the control group (245 days vs 580 days, P=0.037; 494 days vs 809 days, P=0.04). The CR after the first course chemotherapy and cumulative CR in CD19(+) AML patients were higher than those in the control group(75.0% vs 58.1%, P=0.46; 100% vs 87.5%, P=0.02). The median time of CR in CD19(+) AML was shorter than that in the control group (28 days vs 46 days, P=0.02). The PFS time and OS time of CD19(+) AML tended to be longer than those in the control group (P=0.13, P=0.07, respectively). The median PFS and OS were not reached at the time of last follow-up. The CR after the first course chemotherapy, cumulative CR and median time to CR in CD7(+) AML patients were not different from those in the control group (53.1% vs 58.1%, P=0.67; 87.1% vs 87.5%, P=0.44; 50 days vs 46 days, P=0.44). No differences of PFS and OS were observed between CD7(+) AML and the control.CD56(+) AML patients respond poorly to treatment, frequently relapse after complete remission and have a low survival rate. These patients need more intensive chemotherapy or in combination with other treatments. The interval of MRD detection should be shortened to find out relapse earlier. CD19(+) AML patients have a good treatment outcome and often accompanies with AML1/ETO fusion gene, which is known to be a good prognostic marker. Aberrant expression of CD7 on AML cells is not a poor prognostic factor in this study.((PMID:27512117))Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) carrying t(8;21)(q22;q22) or inv(16)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) is classified as core binding factor (CBF)-AML and accounts for approximately 15% of AML. c-KIT mutation can be detected in 17%∼46% of CBF-AML and is associated with poor prognosis. c-KIT mutation is a crucial hit and cooperates with AML1-ETO resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) to cause overt AML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting c-KIT, such as imatinib, has been used successfully to treat c-KIT driven gastrointestinal stromal tumors. However, the effect of TKI on c-KIT-driven leukemia, including CBF-AML and systemic mastocytosis (SM), has not been satisfactory. BPR1J373 is a 5-phenylthiazol-2-ylamine-pyriminide derivative targeting multiple tyrosine kinases. It was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells with constitutively activated c-KIT via inhibiting c-KIT phosphorylation and its downstream signals. The compound induced apoptosis by the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway through upregulation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak and caspase 8 and 9 activation in c-KIT mutant Kasumi-1 cells. Furthermore, it induced cell-cycle arrest via targeting aurora kinase B in c-KIT wild-type KG-1 cells. The antitumor response of BPR1J373 was also shown in subcutaneously grafted SCID mice. BPR1J373 was shown to effectively suppress c-KIT phosphorylation of D816V mutation by treating c-KIT-null COS-1 cells transfected with c-KIT D816V mutant plasmid. In conclusion, BPR1J373 inhibits cell proliferation of c-KIT-driven AML cells via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. It is also effective for multiple drug-resistant c-KIT D816V mutation. BPR1J373 deserves further development for clinical use in c-KIT-driven myeloid leukemia.

Enabling replicative immortalization via telomerase reactivation is a crucial step in cancer development. However, AE expression alone is not sufficient to maintain high telomerase activity to immortalize human HSPC cells, which may hamper transformation. Here, we investigated the cooperativity of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic subunit of telomerase, and AE in disease progression. Enforced expression of hTERT immortalized human AE pre-leukemia cells in a telomere-lengthening independent manner, and improved the pre-leukemia stem cell function by enhancing cell proliferation and survival. AE-hTERT cells retained cytokine dependency and multi-lineage differentiation potential similar to parental AE clones. Over the short-term, AE-hTERT cells did not show features of stepwise transformation, with no leukemogenecity evident upon initial injection into immunodeficient mice. Strikingly, after extended culture, we observed full transformation of one AE-hTERT clone, which recapitulated the disease evolution process in patients and emphasizes the importance of acquiring cooperating mutations in t(8;21) AML leukemogenesis. In summary, achieving unlimited proliferative potential via hTERT activation, and thereby allowing for acquisition of additional mutations, is a critical link for transition from pre-leukemia to overt disease in human cells. AE-hTERT cells represent a tractable model to study cooperating genetic lesions important for t(8;21) AML disease progression.((PMID:27486062))The presence of AML1-ETO (RUNX1-CBF2T1), a fusion oncoprotein resulting from a t(8;21) chromosomal translocation, has been implicated as a necessary but insufficient event in the development of a subset of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). While AML1-ETO prolongs survival and inhibits differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), other contributory events are needed for cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. We have postulated that specific tumor suppressor genes keep the leukemic potential of AML1-ETO in check. In studying del(9q), one of the most common concomitant chromosomal abnormalities with t(8;21), we identified the loss of an apparent tumor suppressor, TLE4, that appears to cooperate with AML1-ETO to confer a leukemic phenotype. This study sought to identify the molecular basis of this cooperation. We show that the loss of TLE4 confers proliferative advantage to leukemic cells, simultaneous with an upregulation of a pro- inflammatory signature mediated through aberrant increases in Wnt signaling activity. We further demonstrate that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity partly reverses the pro-leukemic phenotype due to TLE4 knockdown, pointing towards a novel therapeutic approach for myeloid leukemia.((PMID:27460334))It has been reported that amyloid precursor protein (APP) promotes cell proliferation and metastasis in various types of solid cancers. In our previous study, we showed that APP is highly expressed and regulates leukemia cell migration in AML1‑ETO-positive (AE) leukemia. Whether APP is involved in the regulation of AE leukemia cell proliferation or apoptosis is unclear. In the present study we focused on the correlation of APP with c-KIT mutation/overexpression and cell proliferation and apoptosis in AE leukemia. APP and c-KIT expression detected by quantitative real-time (qPCR) method, and c-KIT mutations screened using PCR in bone marrow cells from 65 patients with AE leukemia before their first chemotherapy, were simultaneously assessed. Furthermore, the Kasumi-1 cell line was chosen as the cell model, and the APP gene was knocked down using siRNA technology. The correlation of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis and c-Kit expression with APP expression levels, as well as the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by APP were analyzed in the Kasumi-1 cell line. The results showed that peripheral white blood cell counts (P=0.008) and bone marrow cellularity (P=0.031), but not bone marrow blasts, were correlated with APP expression. Moreover, the patients with APP high expression had a significantly higher incidence of c-KIT mutations (P<0.001) and increased levels of c-KIT expression (P=0.001) and poorer disease outcome. In the Kasumi-1 cell line, as compared with the wild-type and negative control cells, cell apoptosis, both early (P<0.001) and late (P<0.001), was significantly increased when the APP gene was knocked down, concomitant with reduced levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased levels of caspase-3 and -9, however, no apparent change was observed in the cell cycle distribution (P>0.05). Moreover, the knockdown of APP markedly decreased c-KIT expression at both the transcription (as evidenced by qPCR analysis) and translation (as confirmed by CD117 assay and western blot analysis) levels, as well as p-AKT and its downstream targets including NF-κB, p53 and Bcl-2. In conclusion, APP may cooperate with c-KIT mutation/overexpression in the regulation of cell apoptosis but not proliferation in AE leukemia via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.((PMID:27457952))Chromosomal translocation 8;21 is found in 40% of the FAB M2 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The resultant in-frame fusion protein AML1-ETO (AE) acts as an initiating oncogene for leukemia development. AE immortalizes human CD34(+) cord blood cells in long-term culture. We assessed the transforming properties of the alternatively spliced AE isoform AE9a (or alternative splicing at exon 9), which is fully transforming in a murine retroviral model, in human cord blood cells. Full activity was realized only upon increased fusion protein expression. This effect was recapitulated in the AE9a murine AML model. Cotransduction of AE and AE9a resulted in a strong selective pressure for AE-expressing cells. In the context of AE, AE9a did not show selection for increased expression, affirming observations of human t(8;21) patient samples where full-length AE is the dominant protein detected. Mechanistically, AE9a showed defective transcriptional regulation of AE target genes that was partially corrected at high expression. Together, these results bring an additional perspective to our understanding of AE function and highlight the contribution of oncogene expression level in t(8;21) experimental models.((PMID:27431573))MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. miRNAs act in diverse biological processes including development, cell growth, apoptosis, and hematopoiesis. The miRNA expression is associated with specific cytogenetic changes and can also be used to discriminate between the different subtypes of leukemia in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with common translocations, it is shown that the miRNAs have the potential to be used for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. We reviewed the roles of miRNA here with emphasis on their function in human leukemia and the mechanisms of the TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, MLL/AF4 and TCF3/PBX1 oncoproteins on miRNAs expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.((PMID:27418307))((PMID:27352183))Our objective is to explore the tumor-specific mutated genes by transcriptome sequencing of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. 96 patients with subtype M2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), admitted during January 2007 to January 2012, were selected. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from the patients after the first visit and the patients who were improved or alleviated, were subjected to high-throughput sequencing to compare the gene expression. The single nucleotide mutation related to subtype M2 AML was detected. Meanwhile, real-time fluorescent quantitation RT-PCR was used to detect the AML1/ETO fusion gene and its correlation with prognosis after treatment. Among 96 patients, AML1-ETO fusion gene was positive in 52 cases, the positive rate was 54.17 %. The complete relief (CR) rate of AML1-ETO fusion gene positive patients was 84.62 %, and the CR rate of AML1/ETO fusion gene negative patients was 77.27 %; the CR rate of AML1-ETO positive patients was higher than that of patients without the fusion gene, however there was no statistical difference. In the analysis of recurrent gene mutation in AML-M2 patients, IDH2, ASXL1, TET2, JAK1 and JAK2 gene expressions were not significantly different before treatment and after CR, however, IDHI, JAK3, ABL1 and BCR gene expressions were significantly different. In the study of transcriptome in AML-M2 patients, high-throughput sequencing could effectively detect the difference of the gene expression before treatment and after CR. Furthermore, positive expression of AML1-ETO fusion gene had effect on the prognosis of patients.((PMID:27346355))Homeobox genes are known to be key factors in leukemogenesis. Although the TALE family homeodomain factor Meis1 has been linked to malignancy, a role for MEIS2 is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that MEIS2 is expressed at high levels in patients with AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia and that growth of AML1-ETO-positive leukemia depends on MEIS2 expression. In mice, MEIS2 collaborates with AML1-ETO to induce acute myeloid leukemia. MEIS2 binds strongly to the Runt domain of AML1-ETO, indicating a direct interaction between these transcription factors. High expression of MEIS2 impairs repressive DNA binding of AML1-ETO, inducing increased expression of genes such as the druggable proto-oncogene YES1. Collectively, these data describe a pivotal role for MEIS2 in AML1-ETO-induced leukemia.((PMID:27276256))AML1-ETO is the translational product of a chimeric gene created by the stable chromosome translocation t (8;21)(q22;q22). It causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by dysregulating the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation and recently has been reported to bind multiple subunits of the mammalian cytosolic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT), primarily through its DNA binding domain (AML1-175). Through these interactions, TRiC plays an important role in the synthesis, folding, and activity of AML1-ETO. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we demonstrate here that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO's DNA-binding domain (AML1-175) forms a stable complex with apo-TRiC. Our structure reveals that AML1-175 associates directly with a specific subset of TRiC subunits in the open conformation.((PMID:27244239))Salicylate and acetylsalicylic acid are potent and widely used anti-inflammatory drugs. They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-κB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.((PMID:25734857))The wingless-Int (WNT) pathway has an essential role in cell regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). For Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), the malignant counterpart of HSC, currently only a selective number of genes of the WNT pathway are analyzed by using either gene expression or DNA-methylation profiles for the identification of prognostic markers and potential candidate targets for drug therapy. It is known that mRNA expression is controlled by DNA-methylation and that specific patterns can infer the ability to differentiate biological differences, thus a combined analysis using all WNT annotated genes could provide more insight in the WNT signaling.We created a computational approach that integrates gene expression and DNA promoter methylation profiles. The approach represents the continuous gene expression and promoter methylation profiles with nine discrete mutually exclusive scenarios. The scenario representation allows for a refinement of patient groups by a more powerful statistical analysis, and the construction of a co-expression network. We focused on 268 WNT annotated signaling genes that are derived from the molecular signature database.Using the scenarios we identified seven prognostic markers for overall survival and event-free survival. Three genes are novel prognostic markers; two with favorable outcome (PSMD2, PPARD) and one with unfavorable outcome (XPNPEP). The remaining four genes (LEF1, SFRP2, RUNX1, and AXIN2) were previously identified but we could refine the patient groups. Three AML risk groups were further analyzed and the co-expression network showed that only the good risk group harbors frequent promoter hypermethylation and significantly correlated interactions with proteasome family members.Our results provide novel insights in WNT signaling in AML, we discovered new and previously identified prognostic markers and a refinement of the patient groups.((PMID:27119502))Limited evidence is available about the specific miRNA networks that regulate differentiation of specific immune cells. In this study, we characterized miRNA expression and associated alterations in expression with putative mRNA targets that are critical during differentiation of macrophages. In an effort to map the dynamic changes in the bone marrow (BM), we profiled whole BM cultures during differentiation into macrophages. We identified 112 miRNAs with expression patterns that were differentially regulated 5-fold or more during BMDM development. With TargetScan and MeSH databases, we identified 1267 transcripts involved in 30 canonical pathways linked to macrophage biology as potentially regulated by these specific 112 miRNAs. Furthermore, by employing miRanda and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) analysis systems, we identified 18 miRNAs that are temporally linked to the expression of CSF1R, CD36, MSR1 and SCARB1; 7 miRNAs linked to the regulation of the transcription factors RUNX1 and PU.1, and 14 miRNAs target the nuclear receptor PPARα and PPARγ. This novel information provides an important reference resource for further study of the functional links between miRNAs and their target mRNAs for the regulation of differentiation and function of macrophages.((PMID:25289940))Concurrent exercise combines different modes of exercise (e.g., aerobic and resistance) into one training protocol, providing stimuli meant to increase muscle strength, aerobic capacity and mass. As disuse is associated with decrements in strength, aerobic capacity and muscle size concurrent training is an attractive modality for rehabilitation. However, interference between the signaling pathways may result in preferential improvements for one of the exercise modes. We recruited 18 young adults (10 ♂, 8 ♀) to determine if order of exercise mode during concurrent training would differentially affect gene expression, protein content and measures of strength and aerobic capacity after 2 weeks of knee-brace induced disuse. Concurrent exercise sessions were performed 3x/week for 6 weeks at gradually increasing intensities either with endurance exercise preceding (END>RES) or following (RES>END) resistance exercise. Biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis before, 3 h after the first exercise bout and 48 h after the end of training. Concurrent exercise altered the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, PRC, PPARγ), hypertrophy (PGC-1α4, REDD2, Rheb) and atrophy (MuRF-1, Runx1), increased electron transport chain complex protein content, citrate synthase and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity, muscle mass, maximum isometric strength and VO 2peak. However, the order in which exercise was completed (END>RES or RES>END) only affected the protein content of mitochondrial complex II subunit. In conclusion, concurrent exercise training is an effective modality for the rehabilitation of the loss of skeletal muscle mass, maximum strength, and peak aerobic capacity resulting from disuse, regardless of the order in which the modes of exercise are performed.((PMID:19317219))A number of molecular targets have been identified in leukemia, based on the understanding of signaling pathways controlling cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and malignant transformation. Growth factors and integrins interact with their receptors and activate signaling cascades with intimate interconnections. The specific niches within the bone marrow microenvironment may provide a sanctuary for subpopulations of leukemic cells to escape chemotherapy-induced death and acquire drug resistance. Investigations into bone marrow stroma-leukemia crosstalk may result in the development of strategies against the acquisition of a chemo-resistant phenotype and enhance the efficacy of therapies in leukemia. In recent studies, we proposed novel therapeutic interventions targeting the microenvironment/leukemia interaction focusing on SDF1/CXCR4, ILK/PI3K/Akt, TGF-beta, and Notch signaling. Gene transcriptional activity is regulated by chromatin modification and DNA methylation. Nuclear receptors such as RAR, RXR, and PPARgamma exert histone acetyl transferase activity (HAT). The transcription of target genes is initiated following the ligation of these receptors, recruitment of co-activators, and replacement of repressors. We demonstrated that histone acetylation by the PPARgamma agonist CDDO, RAR/RXR agonist ATRA, and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) reversed the silenced RARbeta and MDR1 genes in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that HDACI induced apoptosis with phagocytosis through the induction of Annexin A1 in AML1/ETO-positive acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells. The translation of research findings into effective clinical laboratory tests is an important approach. The flow cytometric technique is a powerful tool in the field of clinical laboratory medicine, with its accurate and rapid analysis. We carried out phospho-specific flow cytometry to investigate protein phosphorylation in AML cells and detect ZAP-70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, including the evaluation of antibodies, staining epitopes, fixing and permeabilizing methods, and analyzing systems. Finally, we emphasize the potential applications of research findings and methods in the fields of clinical medicine, molecular diagnosis, and targeting therapy.((PMID:19536094))The human death-associated protein 3 (hDAP3) is a GTP-binding constituent of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome with a pro-apoptotic function.A search through publicly available microarray data sets showed 337 genes potentially coregulated with the DAP3 gene. The promoter sequences of these 337 genes and 70 out of 85 mitochondrial ribosome genes were analysed in silico with the DAP3 gene promoter sequence. The mitochondrial role of DAP3 was also investigated in the thyroid tumours presenting various mitochondrial contents.The study revealed nine transcription factors presenting enriched motifs for these gene promoters, five of which are implicated in cellular growth (ELK1, ELK4, RUNX1, HOX11-CTF1, TAL1-ternary complex factor 3) and four in mitochondrial biogenesis (nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), GABPA, PPARG-RXRA and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA)). An independent microarray data set showed the overexpression of ELK1, RUNX1 and ESRRA in the thyroid oncocytic tumours. Exploring the thyroid tumours, we found that DAP3 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in tumours presenting a mitochondrial biogenesis compared with the normal tissue. ELK1 and ESRRA were also showed upregulated with DAP3.ELK1 and ESRRA may be considered as potential regulators of the DAP3 gene expression. DAP3 may participate in mitochondrial maintenance and play a role in the balance between mitochondrial homoeostasis and tumourigenesis.
